      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the setup is that there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma times Sz. The magnetic field initially is along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the direction of the magnetic field. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think.\n\nInitially, the field is along Z. The particle's magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. So the energy levels would be determined by the Zeeman effect. When the field is along Z, the spin is quantized along Z. If the field is suddenly turned off, I suppose the magnetic moment would no longer have that quantization direction. But then the field changes direction to Y. So the magnetic field is now along Y, same strength.\n\nWait, but the particle's spin state... When the magnetic field is turned off, the spin isn't interacting with any magnetic field, so it's in a free state. But then the field is applied along Y, so the spin will start to precess around Y.\n\nBut the question is about the average of the z-component of the moment. Oh, right, the expectation value of S_z. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the spin precesses around Y. That should cause the expectation value of S_z to oscillate over time.\n\nI remember that for spin systems, when you have a magnetic field along a certain axis, the spin precesses with a frequency proportional to the field strength and the gyromagnetic ratio (gamma). The energy levels are quantized, and transitions between them cause oscillations in expectation values.\n\nWait, in the initial state, the magnetic field is along Z, so the spin is either up or down along Z. Let's say the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Then, when the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, since the magnetic field is along Y.\n\nWait, the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a field is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So mu is gamma S, and B is along Y, so H = -gamma B S_y. Alternatively, maybe it's positive, depends on the sign convention. But in any case, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.\n\nThe energy eigenstates for H are the eigenstates of S_y. The initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. So when the field is switched, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. Thus, the system will evolve over time, and the expectation values will oscillate.\n\nThe time evolution is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The state will be a superposition of the eigenstates of S_y. The time dependence of expectation values comes from the phases of these eigenstates.\n\nThe energy levels for S_y are \u00b1 (gamma B / 2), because S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 (but wait, spin-1/2, so S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 multiplied by something? Wait, no. Wait, spin angular momentum components have eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 for spin 1/2. So the energy E = - gamma B <S_y>. So if S_y is \u0127/2, then E = - gamma B (\u0127/2) * something.\n\nWait, I might be getting confused here. Let me think again. The magnetic moment mu is gamma S. So the energy is H = - mu \u00b7 B. Since B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nThe eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2 (since spin 1/2), so the energy eigenvalues are E = - gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, no, wait. Because S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so when you multiply by -gamma B, the energies become E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2) * (1), and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2) * (1). Wait, let me compute this correctly.\n\nWait, S_y |s_y> = (\u0127/2) |s_y>, so H |s_y> = -gamma B S_y |s_y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |s_y>.\n\nSo the energies are E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). Wait, that can't be right. Because if B is positive, then E_+ would be negative and E_- positive. Hmm.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the signs. Maybe it's better to just think in terms of the energy splitting and the frequency.\n\nThe energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) )= - gamma B \u0127. So the energy splitting is delta E = 2 * (gamma B \u0127/2) )? Wait, no. Let me calculate E_+ and E_- again.\n\nE_+ = (-gamma B) * (\u0127/2) = - (gamma B \u0127 )/2\n\nE_- = (-gamma B) * (- \u0127/2 ) = (gamma B \u0127 )/2\n\nSo the difference is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2 ) - ( - gamma B \u0127/2 ) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nWait, delta E = E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe frequency of oscillation is given by delta E / hbar. Because E = hbar omega. So omega = delta E / hbar.\n\nSo omega = (gamma B \u0127) ) / \u0127 ) = gamma B.\n\nWait, that would suggest the oscillation frequency is gamma B. But wait, the question is about the average of the z-component of the moment. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the wrong frequency. Because the oscillation frequency of the expectation value depends on the energy difference. Let me think again.\n\nThe time evolution of the state when it's a superposition of energy eigenstates causes the expectation values to oscillate with a frequency equal to the energy difference divided by hbar.\n\nSo the frequency is (E_+ - E_-)/hbar, but wait, wait.\n\nWait, E_+ is -gamma B \u0127/2, E_- is +gamma B \u0127/2. So the difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the frequency is (E_- - E_+)/hbar = (gamma B \u0127 ) / hbar = gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. The energy difference is 2 times (gamma B \u0127/2 ), so that's gamma B \u0127. So frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut the question is about the oscillation of <Sz>, the expectation value of the z-component of the spin. How does that depend on the Hamiltonian?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the time evolution operator. The state |psi(t)> evolves as exp(-i H t / \u0127 ) |psi(0)>.\n\nThe initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's say |+z>, which is (1,0) in the spinor notation. After the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the time evolution is given by U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 )\n\nSo |psi(t)> = U(t) |+z>\n\nI need to compute <Sz> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t) >.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to compute this using the time dependence. Let me think about the matrix representation.\n\nWait, S_z for spin 1/2 is (\u0127/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nS_y is (\u0127/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo H = -gamma B S_y = -gamma B (\u0127/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo H = (-i gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) [[0, -1], [1, 0]]\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 )\n\nLet me compute H t / \u0127:\n\nH t / \u0127 = [ (-i gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) * t ] / \u0127 * [[0, -1], [1, 0]]\n\n= (-i gamma B t / 2 ) * [[0, -1], [1, 0]]\n\nSo H t / \u0127 = (-i gamma B t / 2 ) * [[0, -1], [1, 0]]\n\nHmm, the exponential of a matrix. Let me denote theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo the matrix inside is (-i theta) * [[0, -1], [1, 0]]\n\nWhich is equivalent to a rotation matrix. Because [[0, -1], [1, 0]] is the Pauli Y matrix, multiplied by -i theta.\n\nWait, the exponential of a Pauli matrix times a scalar is known. The exponential of i theta Y is cos(theta) I + i sin(theta) Y.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's -i theta multiplied by Y. Let me think.\n\nLet me write the matrix as M = (-i theta) Y, where Y is the Pauli Y matrix.\n\nSo exp(M) = exp( (-i theta) Y )\n\nThe exponential of a Pauli matrix can be written as:\n\nexp(i phi Y) = I cos(phi) + i Y sin(phi)\n\nSo in this case, phi is (- theta), and the i is already there. Hmm, let me see.\n\nWait, M = (-i theta) Y. So M = -i theta Y.\n\nThen exp(M) = exp( -i theta Y )\n\nWhich would be I cos(theta) - i Y sin(theta )\n\nBecause in the general case, exp( i a Y ) = I cos(a) + i Y sin(a)\n\nSo for exp( -i theta Y ), it's I cos(theta) - i Y sin(theta )\n\nSo the time evolution operator U(t) is exp( -i H t / \u0127 ) = I cos(theta) - i Y sin(theta ), where theta is gamma B t / 2.\n\nWait, theta is gamma B t / 2 because theta = (gamma B t) / 2.\n\nSo, U(t) = [cos(theta) I ] - i [ Y sin(theta) ]\n\nNow, the initial state is |+z> = [1; 0]. Let me apply U(t) to this state.\n\nU(t) |+z> = [cos(theta) I - i Y sin(theta) ] [1; 0]\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nI [1; 0] = [1; 0]\n\nY [1; 0] = [0, -i; i, 0 ] [1; 0] = [0 * 1 + (-i) * 0; i * 1 + 0 * 0 ]? Wait, no, matrix multiplication.\n\nWait, Y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo Y [1; 0] = [0 *1 + (-i)*0; i *1 + 0 *0 ] = [0; i ]\n\nWait, no, wait: [0*(-i) ??? Wait, no, let's compute it correctly.\n\nWait, matrix Y is:\n\nRow 1: 0, -i\n\nRow 2: i, 0\n\nSo when multiplied by [1; 0], it's:\n\nRow 1: 0*1 + (-i)*0 = 0\n\nRow 2: i*1 + 0*0 = i\n\nSo Y [1; 0] = [0; i ]\n\nSo then, Y [1;0] is [0; i ]\n\nSo back to U(t) |+z>:\n\n= cos(theta) [1;0] - i [0; i ] sin(theta )\n\n= [ cos(theta), 0; 0, cos(theta) ] [1;0] - i [0; i ] sin(theta )\n\nWait, no, it's [ cos(theta)*1, ...; ... ]\n\nWait, no, more accurately:\n\nU(t) |+z> = cos(theta) [1; 0] - i [0; i ] sin(theta )\n\nSo, the first term is [cos(theta), 0]^T.\n\nThe second term is -i [0; i ] sin(theta) = [0; -i^2 sin(theta) ].\n\nBut i^2 is -1, so it's [0; - (-1) sin(theta) ] = [0; sin(theta) ].\n\nSo combining the two terms:\n\n= [ cos(theta), 0 ]^T + [0; sin(theta) ]\n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait, no. Let me compute each component.\n\nFirst component: cos(theta) * 1 + (-i) * 0 * sin(theta) \u2192 cos(theta )\n\nSecond component: cos(theta) * 0 + (-i) * i * sin(theta )\n\nWait, no, I think I messed up the decomposition.\n\nWait, U(t) |+z> = [cos(theta) * 1 - i * 0 * sin(theta) ] in the first component?\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to compute each component step by step.\n\nLet me write U(t) as a matrix:\n\nU(t) = [ [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ], [ sin(theta), cos(theta) ] ]\n\nWait, no. Because Y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo Y = i * [[0, -1], [1, 0]]\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent the operator in terms of real angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the state as a vector in spin space.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nThe state after time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [ cos(theta) I - i Y sin(theta) ] [1; 0 ]\n\nCompute each part:\n\ncos(theta) I [1; 0] = [ cos(theta), 0; 0, cos(theta) ] [1; 0] = [ cos(theta); cos(theta) ]\n\nWait, no, wait. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so when multiplied by [1;0], it's [1;0].\n\nThen, the term -i Y sin(theta) [1;0 ]:\n\nY [1;0 ] is [0; i ] as before.\n\nMultiply by -i sin(theta):\n\n- i * [0; i ] sin(theta ) = [0; (-i)(i) sin(theta) ]\n\nBut (-i)(i) = -i^2 = 1, since i^2=-1.\n\nSo this becomes [0; 1 * sin(theta) ]\n\nSo the entire state is [ cos(theta) ] + [0; sin(theta) ] = [ cos(theta); cos(theta) + sin(theta) ]?\n\nWait, no, no. Because the first term is [cos(theta), 0; 0, cos(theta)] [1;0] = [cos(theta); 0 ].\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, the first term is cos(theta) I [1;0 ] = [ cos(theta) * 1, 0 ]^T ?\n\nNo, wait. No, the identity matrix I multiplied by a scalar cos(theta) gives a matrix [[cos(theta), 0], [0, cos(theta)]]. Then, when you multiply this by [1;0], you get [cos(theta)*1 + 0*0; 0*1 + cos(theta)*0 ] \u2192 [cos(theta); 0].\n\nThe second term is -i Y sin(theta ) [1;0 ]\n\nWe found that Y [1;0 ] = [0; i ]\n\nSo -i Y sin(theta ) [1;0 ] = -i [0; i ] sin(theta ) = [ 0; (-i)(i) sin(theta) ]\n\nWhich is [0; (1) sin(theta) ] because (-i)(i) = -i\u00b2 = -(-1) = 1.\n\nSo the second term is [0; sin(theta) ]\n\nSo the entire |psi(t)> is:\n\n[ cos(theta); 0 ] + [0; sin(theta) ] = [ cos(theta), 0 + sin(theta) ]^T \u2192 [ cos(theta); sin(theta) ]\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the state after time t would have components [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T. But wait, let's think about normalization. The norm is sqrt( cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ) = 1, which is correct.\n\nSo |psi(t)> = [ cos(theta); sin(theta) ] where theta is (gamma B t)/2.\n\nNow, compute <Sz> = [1, 0] [S_z] [ cos(theta); sin(theta) ]\n\nS_z is (\u0127/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSo S_z |psi(t)> = (\u0127/2) [ cos(theta); - sin(theta) ]\n\nSo <Sz> = [1, 0] (\u0127/2) [ cos(theta); - sin(theta) ] = (\u0127/2) [ cos(theta) ]\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the expectation value of S_z is (\u0127/2) cos(theta )\n\nBut theta is (gamma B t ) / 2.\n\nSo <Sz> = (\u0127/2 ) cos( (gamma B t ) / 2 )\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is (gamma B ) / 2.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the average of mu_z, the z-component of the magnetic moment.\n\nmu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos( (gamma B t ) / 2 )\n\nSo the oscillation frequency of <mu_z> is (gamma B ) / 2.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is gamma B / 2.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The oscillation frequency of <Sz> is (gamma B )/(2), so the frequency of <mu_z> is the same as the frequency of <Sz>, because it's just multiplied by a constant gamma.\n\nWait, no, because <mu_z> is proportional to <Sz>, so their oscillations have the same frequency.\n\nWait, yes. Because <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>, so if <Sz> oscillates with frequency omega, <mu_z> also oscillates with the same omega.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is omega = gamma B / 2.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A) gamma B / 2 \u2192 this matches.\n\nSo the answer should be option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, we analyze the system as follows:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The particle is a spin-1/2 system with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially in a magnetic field along the +Z direction.

Let me calculate E_+ and E_- again.\n\nE_+ = (-gamma B) * (\u0127/2) = - (gamma B \u0127 )/2\n\nE_- = (-gamma B) * (- \u0127/2 ) = (gamma B \u0127 )/2\n\nSo the difference is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2 ) - ( - gamma B \u0127/2 ) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nWait, delta E = E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe frequency of oscillation is given by delta E / hbar. Because E = hbar omega. So omega = delta E / hbar.\n\nSo omega = (gamma B \u0127) ) / \u0127 ) = gamma B.\n\nWait, that would suggest the oscillation frequency is gamma B. But wait, the question is about the average of the z-component of the moment. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the wrong frequency. Because the oscillation frequency of the expectation value depends on the energy difference. Let me think again.\n\nThe time evolution of the state when it's a superposition of energy eigenstates causes the expectation values to oscillate with a frequency equal to the energy difference divided by hbar.\n\nSo the frequency is (E_+ - E_-)/hbar, but wait, wait.\n\nWait, E_+ is -gamma B \u0127/2, E_- is +gamma B \u0127/2. So the difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the frequency is (E_- - E_+)/hbar = (gamma B \u0127 ) / hbar = gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. The energy difference is 2 times (gamma B \u0127/2 ), so that's gamma B \u0127. So frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut the question is about the oscillation of <Sz>, the expectation value of the z-component of the spin. How does that depend on the Hamiltonian?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the time evolution operator. The state |psi(t)> evolves as exp(-i H t / \u0127 ) |psi(0)>.\n\nThe initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's say |+z>, which is (1,0) in the spinor notation. After the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the time evolution is given by U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 )\n\nSo |psi(t)> = U(t) |+z>\n\nI need to compute <Sz> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t) >.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to compute this using the time dependence. Let me think about the matrix representation.\n\nWait, S_z for spin 1/2 is (\u0127/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nS_y is (\u0127/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo H = -gamma B S_y = -gamma B (\u0127/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo H = (-i gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) [[0, -1], [1, 0]]\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 )\n\nLet me compute H t / \u0127:\n\nH t / \u0127 = [ (-i gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) * t ] / \u0127 * [[0, -1], [1, 0]]\n\n= (-i gamma B t / 2 ) * [[0, -1], [1, 0]]\n\nSo H t / \u0127 = (-i gamma B t / 2 ) * [[0, -1], [1, 0]]\n\nHmm, the exponential of a matrix. Let me denote theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo the matrix inside is (-i theta) * [[0, -1], [1, 0]]\n\nWhich is equivalent to a rotation matrix. Because [[0, -1], [1, 0]] is the Pauli Y matrix, multiplied by -i theta.\n\nWait, the exponential of a Pauli matrix times a scalar is known. The exponential of i theta Y is cos(theta) I + i sin(theta) Y.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's -i theta multiplied by Y. Let me think.\n\nLet me write the matrix as M = (-i theta) Y, where Y is the Pauli Y matrix.\n\nSo exp(M) = exp( (-i theta) Y )\n\nThe exponential of a Pauli matrix can be written as:\n\nexp(i phi Y) = I cos(phi) + i Y sin(phi)\n\nSo in this case, phi is (- theta), and the i is already there. Hmm, let me see.\n\nWait, M = (-i theta) Y. So M = -i theta Y.\n\nThen exp(M) = exp( -i theta Y )\n\nWhich would be I cos(theta) - i Y sin(theta )\n\nBecause in the general case, exp( i a Y ) = I cos(a) + i Y sin(a)\n\nSo for exp( -i theta Y ), it's I cos(theta) - i Y sin(theta )\n\nSo the time evolution operator U(t) is exp( -i H t / \u0127 ) = I cos(theta) - i Y sin(theta ), where theta is gamma B t / 2.\n\nWait, theta is gamma B t / 2 because theta = (gamma B t) / 2.\n\nSo, U(t) = [cos(theta) I ] - i [ Y sin(theta) ]\n\nNow, the initial state is |+z> = [1; 0]. Let me apply U(t) to this state.\n\nU(t) |+z> = [cos(theta) I - i Y sin(theta) ] [1; 0]\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nI [1; 0] = [1; 0]\n\nY [1; 0] = [0, -i; i, 0 ] [1; 0] = [0 * 1 + (-i) * 0; i * 1 + 0 * 0 ]? Wait, no, matrix multiplication.\n\nWait, Y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo Y [1; 0] = [0 *1 + (-i)*0; i *1 + 0 *0 ] = [0; i ]\n\nWait, no, wait: [0*(-i) ??? Wait, no, let's compute it correctly.\n\nWait, matrix Y is:\n\nRow 1: 0, -i\n\nRow 2: i, 0\n\nSo when multiplied by [1; 0], it's:\n\nRow 1: 0*1 + (-i)*0 = 0\n\nRow 2: i*1 + 0*0 = i\n\nSo Y [1; 0] = [0; i ]\n\nSo then, Y [1;0] is [0; i ]\n\nSo back to U(t) |+z>:\n\n= cos(theta) [1;0] - i [0; i ] sin(theta )\n\n= [ cos(theta), 0; 0, cos(theta) ] [1;0] - i [0; i ] sin(theta )\n\nWait, no, it's [ cos(theta)*1, ...; ... ]\n\nWait, no, more accurately:\n\nU(t) |+z> = cos(theta) [1; 0] - i [0; i ] sin(theta )\n\nSo, the first term is [cos(theta), 0]^T.\n\nThe second term is -i [0; i ] sin(theta) = [0; -i^2 sin(theta) ].\n\nBut i^2 is -1, so it's [0; - (-1) sin(theta) ] = [0; sin(theta) ].\n\nSo combining the two terms:\n\n= [ cos(theta), 0 ]^T + [0; sin(theta) ]\n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait, no. Let me compute each component.\n\nFirst component: cos(theta) * 1 + (-i) * 0 * sin(theta) \u2192 cos(theta )\n\nSecond component: cos(theta) * 0 + (-i) * i * sin(theta )\n\nWait, no, I think I messed up the decomposition.\n\nWait, U(t) |+z> = [cos(theta) * 1 - i * 0 * sin(theta) ] in the first component?\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to compute each component step by step.\n\nLet me write U(t) as a matrix:\n\nU(t) = [ [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ], [ sin(theta), cos(theta) ] ]\n\nWait, no. Because Y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo Y = i * [[0, -1], [1, 0]]\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent the operator in terms of real angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the state as a vector in spin space.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nThe state after time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [ cos(theta) I - i Y sin(theta) ] [1; 0 ]\n\nCompute each part:\n\ncos(theta) I [1; 0] = [ cos(theta), 0; 0, cos(theta) ] [1; 0] = [ cos(theta); cos(theta) ]\n\nWait, no, wait. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so when multiplied by [1;0], it's [1;0].\n\nThen, the term -i Y sin(theta) [1;0 ]:\n\nY [1;0 ] is [0; i ] as before.\n\nMultiply by -i sin(theta):\n\n- i * [0; i ] sin(theta ) = [0; (-i)(i) sin(theta) ]\n\nBut (-i)(i) = -i^2 = 1, since i^2=-1.\n\nSo this becomes [0; 1 * sin(theta) ]\n\nSo the entire state is [ cos(theta) ] + [0; sin(theta) ] = [ cos(theta); cos(theta) + sin(theta) ]?\n\nWait, no, no. Because the first term is [cos(theta), 0; 0, cos(theta)] [1;0] = [cos(theta); 0 ].\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, the first term is cos(theta) I [1;0 ] = [ cos(theta) * 1, 0 ]^T ?\n\nNo, wait. No, the identity matrix I multiplied by a scalar cos(theta) gives a matrix [[cos(theta), 0], [0, cos(theta)]]. Then, when you multiply this by [1;0], you get [cos(theta)*1 + 0*0; 0*1 + cos(theta)*0 ] \u2192 [cos(theta); 0].\n\nThe second term is -i Y sin(theta ) [1;0 ]\n\nWe found that Y [1;0 ] = [0; i ]\n\nSo -i Y sin(theta ) [1;0 ] = -i [0; i ] sin(theta ) = [ 0; (-i)(i) sin(theta) ]\n\nWhich is [0; (1) sin(theta) ] because (-i)(i) = -i\u00b2 = -(-1) = 1.\n\nSo the second term is [0; sin(theta) ]\n\nSo the entire |psi(t)> is:\n\n[ cos(theta); 0 ] + [0; sin(theta) ] = [ cos(theta), 0 + sin(theta) ]^T \u2192 [ cos(theta); sin(theta) ]\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the state after time t would have components [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T. But wait, let's think about normalization. The norm is sqrt( cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ) = 1, which is correct.\n\nSo |psi(t)> = [ cos(theta); sin(theta) ] where theta is (gamma B t)/2.\n\nNow, compute <Sz> = [1, 0] [S_z] [ cos(theta); sin(theta) ]\n\nS_z is (\u0127/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSo S_z |psi(t)> = (\u0127/2) [ cos(theta); - sin(theta) ]\n\nSo <Sz> = [1, 0] (\u0127/2) [ cos(theta); - sin(theta) ] = (\u0127/2) [ cos(theta) ]\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the expectation value of S_z is (\u0127/2) cos(theta )\n\nBut theta is (gamma B t ) / 2.\n\nSo <Sz> = (\u0127/2 ) cos( (gamma B t ) / 2 )\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is (gamma B ) / 2.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the average of mu_z, the z-component of the magnetic moment.\n\nmu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos( (gamma B t ) / 2 )\n\nSo the oscillation frequency of <mu_z> is (gamma B ) / 2.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is gamma B / 2.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The oscillation frequency of <Sz> is (gamma B )/(2), so the frequency of <mu_z> is the same as the frequency of <Sz>, because it's just multiplied by a constant gamma.\n\nWait, no, because <mu_z> is proportional to <Sz>, so their oscillations have the same frequency.\n\nWait, yes. Because <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>, so if <Sz> oscillates with frequency omega, <mu_z> also oscillates with the same omega.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is omega = gamma B / 2.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A) gamma B / 2 \u2192 this matches.\n\nSo the answer should be option A.\n\n\nTo determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, we analyze the system as follows:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The particle is a spin-1/2 system with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially in a magnetic field along the +Z direction. The energy levels are quantized due to the Zeeman effect.\n\n2. **Field Switch**: The magnetic field is suddenly turned off and reactivated along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The Hamiltonian changes to $H = -\\gamma B S_y$, where $S_y$ is the spin operator along the Y-axis.\n\n3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state is an eigenstate of $S_z$ (e.g., $|+z\\rangle$). After the field is switched, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. The system evolves according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, with the time evolution operator $U(t) = \\exp(-iHt/\\hbar)$.\n\n4. **Matrix Representation**: The spin-1/2 operators are represented as:\n   - $S_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n   - $S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n   Substituting into $H$, we get:\n   \\[\n   H = -\\gamma B S_y = -\\gamma B \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Time Evolution Operator**: The time evolution operator becomes:\n   \\[\n   U(t) = \\exp\\left(-i \\frac{H}{\\hbar} t\\right) = \\exp\\left(-i \\frac{\\gamma B}{2} t \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\right).\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of Pauli matrices, this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   U(t) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right)I - i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right)\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **State Evolution**: The initial state $|+z\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ evolves as:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = U(t)|+z\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right) \\\\ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right) \\end{bmatrix}.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: The expectation value of $S_z$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right).\n   \\]\n\n8. **Magnetic Moment**: The magnetic moment $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$, so:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\gamma \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right).\n   \\]\n\n9. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation frequency of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ is determined by the argument of the cosine function, which is $\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}$. Thus, the oscillation frequency is:\n   \\[\n   \\omega = \\frac{\\gamma B}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n10. **Answer Selection**: Among the given options, the correct frequency is $\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}$, which corresponds to **Option A**.\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nAlright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by mu = gamma * Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. Since mu is proportional to Sz, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the field. That makes sense because for spin-1/2 particles, the energy is minimized when the magnetic moment is aligned with the field.\n\nBut then the magnetic field is switched off and turned on along Y. So the system's Hamiltonian must change suddenly. I remember that when the Hamiltonian changes, the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously if the change is sudden. So the initial state after the switch would still be the eigenstate of the previous Hamiltonian, which was along Z.\n\nLet me think about the initial state. The particle's magnetic moment is along +Z, so its spin state is either up or down along Z. Since the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz, the expectation value of the z-component would be either +gamma (hbar/2) or -gamma (hbar/2), but I think in this context, perhaps the state is in an eigenstate of Sz.\n\nWait, but when the field is along Z, the spin is in an eigenstate of Sz. So when the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. So the new Hamiltonian H' is something like -mu\u00b7B in the Y direction. Let me write that properly.\n\nThe magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is given by H = -mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, H' = -gamma S_y B. So H' = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, or is it positive? Oh, the magnetic moment is in the same direction as the spin. So the Hamiltonian should be H = - mu \u00b7 B. So mu is gamma S, so H = - gamma B (S \u00b7 n), where n is the direction of B. Here, n is along Y, so H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but I think in quantum mechanics, the energy is given by E = - mu \u00b7 B. So for spin, mu = gamma S, so H = -gamma B S\u00b7n. So when B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but sometimes the Hamiltonian is written as H = - mu \u00b7 B, which would be negative. But sometimes I've seen it written with a positive sign. Oh wait, actually, the energy is lower when the magnetic moment is aligned with the field, so if mu is in the same direction as B, then the energy is negative. So H = - mu \u00b7 B.\n\nSo yeah, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nNow, the initial state was an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say it was |+z>, which is spin-up along Z.\n\nSo the state before the field change is |psi_initial> = |+z>.\n\nAfter the field change, the Hamiltonian is H' = - gamma B S_y. So the new Hamiltonian's eigenstates are along Y. The initial state is not an eigenstate of H', so it will evolve over time.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by |psi(t)> = e^(-i H' t / \u0127) |psi_initial> .\n\nWait, but since H' is proportional to S_y, which is a spin operator, maybe we can diagonalize it or express it in terms of spin states along Y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo we need to find the expectation value of S_z as a function of time, then find its oscillation frequency.\n\nSo the average value of S_z is <S_z> = (1/gamma) <mu_z>.\n\nWait, no, mu_z = gamma <S_z>, so the average mu_z is gamma times the average S_z.\n\nSo the oscillation in <mu_z> will be due to the time evolution of S_z.\n\nLet me think about the time evolution of S_z. Since the system is governed by H' = -gamma B S_y, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H' t / \u0127).\n\nBut let's think about the units. H' has units of energy, so gamma must be in (rad/s) per Tesla, perhaps? Because B is in Tesla, S is dimensionless (since it's spin-1/2), so H' is gamma * B.\n\nWait, actually, the units might be a bit tricky, but perhaps I can proceed without worrying about that for now.\n\nThe time evolution of an observable O is given by:\n\nO(t) = U\u2020 O U\n\nSo S_z(t) = e^{i H' t / \u0127} S_z e^{-i H' t / \u0127}\n\nBecause the time evolution operator is U = e^{-i H' t / \u0127}, so U\u2020 = e^{i H' t / \u0127}.\n\nSo to find the expectation value of S_z, we can compute <psi_initial | S_z(t) | psi_initial>.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to look at the Heisenberg equation of motion for S_z. The Heisenberg equation is:\n\ndS_z/dt = (i/\u0127) [H', S_z]\n\nSo let's compute [H', S_z].\n\nH' = - gamma B S_y, so [H', S_z] = - gamma B [S_y, S_z]\n\nI remember that the commutator [S_i, S_j] = i \u0127 \u03b5_ijk S_k, where \u03b5 is the Levi-Civita symbol. So [S_y, S_z] = i \u0127 S_x.\n\nSo [H', S_z] = - gamma B (i \u0127 S_x )\n\nSo substituting into the equation:\n\ndS_z/dt = (i/\u0127) (- gamma B) (i \u0127 S_x )\n\nSimplify that:\n\ni * (i) = i^2 = -1.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_z/dt = (i/\u0127) * (- gamma B) * (i \u0127 S_x )\n\nThe \u0127 cancels out, and the i's multiply to -1.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_z/dt = (i)(-gamma B) (i S_x) ) /1\n\nWait, wait, let me compute it again.\n\nWait, [H', S_z] = -gamma B [S_y, S_z] = -gamma B (i \u0127 S_x )\n\nSo,\n\ndS_z/dt = (i/\u0127) * [H', S_z] = (i/\u0127) * (- gamma B) (i \u0127 S_x )\n\nThe \u0127 in the denominator cancels with the \u0127 in the numerator.\n\nSo,\n\n= (i) * (- gamma B) * (i) * S_x\n\nMultiply the i's:\n\ni * i = i\u00b2 = -1.\n\nSo,\n\n= (i * i) * (gamma B) S_x * (-1) [Wait, let me compute the signs.]\n\nWait, (i) * (- gamma B) * (i) = (- gamma B) * i\u00b2 = (- gamma B) (-1) )= gamma B.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B S_x.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, we can write the Heisenberg equation for S_x as well.\n\nLet me find dS_x/dt.\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/\u0127) [H', S_x] = (i/\u0127) [ -gamma B S_y, S_x ]\n\nCompute [S_y, S_x] = i \u0127 (-S_z), because [S_i, S_j] = i\u0127 \u03b5_ijk S_k. So [S_y, S_x] = i \u0127 (-S_z).\n\nSo,\n\n[H', S_x] = -gamma B [S_y, S_x ] = -gamma B (i \u0127 (-S_z) ) = gamma B (i \u0127 S_z )\n\nSo,\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/\u0127) * [H', S_x ] = (i/\u0127) * gamma B (i \u0127 S_z )\n\n= i * gamma B * i * S_z\n\nAgain, i^2 = -1, so:\n\n= (-1) gamma B S_z.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute dS_y/dt.\n\n[H', S_y] = [ -gamma B S_y, S_y ] = 0.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_y/dt = (i/\u0127) * 0 = 0.\n\nSo S_y is constant in Heisenberg picture.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so S_y commutes with H', and thus its time derivative is zero. So S_y doesn't change.\n\nSo now, we have the following system of differential equations:\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B S_x\n\ndS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z\n\ndS_y/dt = 0.\n\nHmm, this looks like the equations for a harmonic oscillator. Let me see.\n\nIf I take the second derivative of S_z:\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = d/dt (gamma B S_x) = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B (- gamma B S_z ) = - (gamma B)^2 S_z.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = - (gamma B)^2 S_z.\n\nThe solution to this is S_z(t) = A cos(omega t) + B sin(omega t), where omega is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the equation is d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = - (gamma B)^2 S_z.\n\nSo the angular frequency omega is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, that would imply that the frequency of oscillation is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo <mu_z(t)> = gamma <S_z(t)>.\n\nSo if <S_z(t)> oscillates with frequency gamma B, then <mu_z(t)> also oscillates with the same frequency.\n\nWait, but wait, looking back at the equations:\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B S_x.\n\ndS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z.\n\nSo the system is a coupled oscillator. Let me think about the time dependence.\n\nAssume S_z(0) = S_z0, S_x(0) = 0.\n\nThen, S_z(t) would be S_z0 cos(gamma B t) and S_x(t) = S_z0 sin(gamma B t).\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, wait, the options are given as gamma*B, gamma*B/sqrt(2), etc.\n\nSo option B is gamma*B, which would match this conclusion.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the Heisenberg equations.\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z>, so at t=0, the expectation value of S_z is \u0127/2 (since S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2)|+z> ), and the expectation value of S_x is zero.\n\nSo, let's compute <S_z(t)>.\n\nIn Heisenberg picture, S_z(t) = e^{i H' t / \u0127} S_z e^{-i H' t / \u0127}.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to use the time evolution operator.\n\nWait, another approach: express the initial state |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H'.\n\nH' is proportional to S_y, so its eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +/- (gamma B \u0127/2), perhaps.\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So H' = -gamma B S_y, so eigenvalues are -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2 ) = \u2213 gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nSo the energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E+ = - gamma B ( \u0127/2 ) and E- = gamma B ( \u0127/2 ).\n\nWait, no, because H' = -gamma B S_y, so S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, so H' |+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nSo E+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2 )\n\nSimilarly, H' |-y> = gamma B (\u0127/2) |-y>, so E- = gamma B ( \u0127/2 )\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the energies as E_+ = (- gamma B) (\u0127/2 ), E_- = (+ gamma B) ( \u0127/2 )\n\nWait, no, wait, H' = -gamma B S_y.\n\nSo S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nThus, H' |+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y> => E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2 )\n\nSimilarly, H' |-y> = gamma B (\u0127/2) |-y> => E_- = gamma B ( \u0127/2 )\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe state |+z> in the S_y basis is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nBecause the eigenstates of S_z and S_y are not the same.\n\nSo, |+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>\n\nWe can find a and b by expressing |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of S_y.\n\nThe eigenstates of S_y are |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, no, the standard expressions are:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSimilarly, |-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo yes, the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo when the Hamiltonian changes, the state remains |+z>, which is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the time evolution under H' is each component evolves with their respective phase factors.\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t / \u0127} |-y> ]\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ = (- gamma B) ( \u0127/2 )\nE_- = (+ gamma B) ( \u0127/2 )\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i gamma B t (\u0127/2) / \u0127} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t (\u0127/2) / \u0127} |-y> ]\n\nWait, because E_+ t / \u0127 = (- gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 = - gamma B t / 2\n\nSimilarly, E_- t / \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i (gamma B t / 2) } |+y> + e^{-i (gamma B t / 2) } |-y> ]\n\nBut |+y> and |-y> can be written in terms of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nWait, let me express this in terms of S_z basis.\n\nExpressing |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i (gamma B t / 2) } (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) + e^{-i (gamma B t / 2) } (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |-z>) ) ]\n\nWhere theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ ( e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} ) |+z> + ( e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} ) |-z> ]\n\nUsing Euler's formula: e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos(theta)\nAnd e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin(theta)\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> + 2i sin(theta) |-z> ]\n\n= [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ]\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z>\n\nWhere theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is:\n\n<S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>\n\nCompute this:\n\n= [ cos(theta)* < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ]\n\nSince S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, and S_z |-z> = (- \u0127/2) |-z>.\n\nSo,\n\n= cos(theta) * i sin(theta) * < +z | S_z |-z> + other terms.\n\nWait, let's compute each term:\n\nThe first term is cos(theta) * cos(theta) < +z | S_z | +z > = cos^2(theta) (\u0127/2)\n\nSecond term: cos(theta) * i sin(theta) < +z | S_z | -z >.\n\nBut < +z | S_z | -z > = (\u0127/2) < +z | -z > = 0, because |+z> and |-z> are orthogonal.\n\nThird term: i sin(theta) * cos(theta) < -z | S_z | +z > = 0 for the same reason.\n\nFourth term: i sin(theta) * i sin(theta) < -z | S_z | -z >.\n\n= i^2 sin^2(theta) (\u0127/2 ) = (-1) sin^2(theta) (\u0127/2 )\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = [ cos^2(theta) (\u0127/2) ) ] + [ (- sin^2(theta) ) (\u0127/2 ) ]\n\n= [ (cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ) ] (\u0127/2 )\n\n= cos(2 theta) (\u0127/2 )\n\nBecause cos(2 theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = ( \u0127/2 ) cos( 2 theta )\n\nBut theta = gamma B t / 2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of S_z oscillates with angular frequency gamma B.\n\nBut the question is about the oscillation of the z-component of the magnetic moment, mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z(t) > = gamma < S_z(t) > = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the units here. Wait, because S_z has units of \u0127. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, S_z is in units of \u0127. So, <S_z> is (\u0127/2) times a dimensionless factor.\n\nBut when you compute mu_z, which is gamma times S_z, the units would be appropriate for magnetic moment.\n\nBut regardless, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, the expectation value is oscillating as cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma*B, which would be the answer.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because another approach suggested that the frequency is gamma*B/sqrt(2). Did I miss something?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the Heisenberg equations. Earlier, I found that d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = - (gamma B)^2 S_z, leading to angular frequency gamma B.\n\nIn the state approach, the expectation of S_z oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the same conclusion.\n\nBut why is there an option D, which is gamma B over sqrt(2)? Did I make a mistake in the state approach?\n\nWait, wait in the state approach, <S_z(t)> is (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t), so the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle\u2019s moment, which is mu_z. So, since mu_z = gamma S_z, and <S_z> oscillates with frequency gamma B, then <mu_z> also oscillates with the same frequency.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B, gamma*B.\n\nWait, but wait, another way to think about it is using energy levels. The energy splitting between |+y> and |-y> is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127.\n\nBecause E_+ = - (gamma B) ( \u0127/2 )\n\nE_- = + (gamma B) ( \u0127/2 )\n\nSo the energy difference is gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe frequency of oscillation between these states would be (E_- - E_+)/ \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWhich matches the previous conclusion.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, so the answer is option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction.

The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis\n\n1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  \n   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\\rangle$. When the magnetic field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H' = -\\gamma B S_y$. This Hamiltonian governs the time evolution of the system.\n\n2. **Time Evolution**:  \n   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ is not an eigenstate of $H'$, so the system evolves over time. The eigenstates of $H'$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\\pm \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$. The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$:\n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   Under time evolution, the state becomes:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{-iE_+t/\\hbar} |+y\\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\\hbar} |-y\\rangle \\right),\n   \\]\n   where $E_+ = -\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$ and $E_- = \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nAlright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by mu = gamma * Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. Since mu is proportional to Sz, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the field. That makes sense because for spin-1/2 particles, the energy is minimized when the magnetic moment is aligned with the field.\n\nBut then the magnetic field is switched off and turned on along Y. So the system's Hamiltonian must change suddenly. I remember that when the Hamiltonian changes, the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously if the change is sudden. So the initial state after the switch would still be the eigenstate of the previous Hamiltonian, which was along Z.\n\nLet me think about the initial state. The particle's magnetic moment is along +Z, so its spin state is either up or down along Z. Since the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz, the expectation value of the z-component would be either +gamma (hbar/2) or -gamma (hbar/2), but I think in this context, perhaps the state is in an eigenstate of Sz.\n\nWait, but when the field is along Z, the spin is in an eigenstate of Sz. So when the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. So the new Hamiltonian H' is something like -mu\u00b7B in the Y direction. Let me write that properly.\n\nThe magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is given by H = -mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, H' = -gamma S_y B. So H' = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, or is it positive? Oh, the magnetic moment is in the same direction as the spin. So the Hamiltonian should be H = - mu \u00b7 B. So mu is gamma S, so H = - gamma B (S \u00b7 n), where n is the direction of B. Here, n is along Y, so H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but I think in quantum mechanics, the energy is given by E = - mu \u00b7 B. So for spin, mu = gamma S, so H = -gamma B S\u00b7n. So when B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but sometimes the Hamiltonian is written as H = - mu \u00b7 B, which would be negative. But sometimes I've seen it written with a positive sign. Oh wait, actually, the energy is lower when the magnetic moment is aligned with the field, so if mu is in the same direction as B, then the energy is negative. So H = - mu \u00b7 B.\n\nSo yeah, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nNow, the initial state was an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say it was |+z>, which is spin-up along Z.\n\nSo the state before the field change is |psi_initial> = |+z>.\n\nAfter the field change, the Hamiltonian is H' = - gamma B S_y. So the new Hamiltonian's eigenstates are along Y. The initial state is not an eigenstate of H', so it will evolve over time.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by |psi(t)> = e^(-i H' t / \u0127) |psi_initial> .\n\nWait, but since H' is proportional to S_y, which is a spin operator, maybe we can diagonalize it or express it in terms of spin states along Y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo we need to find the expectation value of S_z as a function of time, then find its oscillation frequency.\n\nSo the average value of S_z is <S_z> = (1/gamma) <mu_z>.\n\nWait, no, mu_z = gamma <S_z>, so the average mu_z is gamma times the average S_z.\n\nSo the oscillation in <mu_z> will be due to the time evolution of S_z.\n\nLet me think about the time evolution of S_z. Since the system is governed by H' = -gamma B S_y, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H' t / \u0127).\n\nBut let's think about the units. H' has units of energy, so gamma must be in (rad/s) per Tesla, perhaps? Because B is in Tesla, S is dimensionless (since it's spin-1/2), so H' is gamma * B.\n\nWait, actually, the units might be a bit tricky, but perhaps I can proceed without worrying about that for now.\n\nThe time evolution of an observable O is given by:\n\nO(t) = U\u2020 O U\n\nSo S_z(t) = e^{i H' t / \u0127} S_z e^{-i H' t / \u0127}\n\nBecause the time evolution operator is U = e^{-i H' t / \u0127}, so U\u2020 = e^{i H' t / \u0127}.\n\nSo to find the expectation value of S_z, we can compute <psi_initial | S_z(t) | psi_initial>.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to look at the Heisenberg equation of motion for S_z. The Heisenberg equation is:\n\ndS_z/dt = (i/\u0127) [H', S_z]\n\nSo let's compute [H', S_z].\n\nH' = - gamma B S_y, so [H', S_z] = - gamma B [S_y, S_z]\n\nI remember that the commutator [S_i, S_j] = i \u0127 \u03b5_ijk S_k, where \u03b5 is the Levi-Civita symbol. So [S_y, S_z] = i \u0127 S_x.\n\nSo [H', S_z] = - gamma B (i \u0127 S_x )\n\nSo substituting into the equation:\n\ndS_z/dt = (i/\u0127) (- gamma B) (i \u0127 S_x )\n\nSimplify that:\n\ni * (i) = i^2 = -1.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_z/dt = (i/\u0127) * (- gamma B) * (i \u0127 S_x )\n\nThe \u0127 cancels out, and the i's multiply to -1.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_z/dt = (i)(-gamma B) (i S_x) ) /1\n\nWait, wait, let me compute it again.\n\nWait, [H', S_z] = -gamma B [S_y, S_z] = -gamma B (i \u0127 S_x )\n\nSo,\n\ndS_z/dt = (i/\u0127) * [H', S_z] = (i/\u0127) * (- gamma B) (i \u0127 S_x )\n\nThe \u0127 in the denominator cancels with the \u0127 in the numerator.\n\nSo,\n\n= (i) * (- gamma B) * (i) * S_x\n\nMultiply the i's:\n\ni * i = i\u00b2 = -1.\n\nSo,\n\n= (i * i) * (gamma B) S_x * (-1) [Wait, let me compute the signs.]\n\nWait, (i) * (- gamma B) * (i) = (- gamma B) * i\u00b2 = (- gamma B) (-1) )= gamma B.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B S_x.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, we can write the Heisenberg equation for S_x as well.\n\nLet me find dS_x/dt.\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/\u0127) [H', S_x] = (i/\u0127) [ -gamma B S_y, S_x ]\n\nCompute [S_y, S_x] = i \u0127 (-S_z), because [S_i, S_j] = i\u0127 \u03b5_ijk S_k. So [S_y, S_x] = i \u0127 (-S_z).\n\nSo,\n\n[H', S_x] = -gamma B [S_y, S_x ] = -gamma B (i \u0127 (-S_z) ) = gamma B (i \u0127 S_z )\n\nSo,\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/\u0127) * [H', S_x ] = (i/\u0127) * gamma B (i \u0127 S_z )\n\n= i * gamma B * i * S_z\n\nAgain, i^2 = -1, so:\n\n= (-1) gamma B S_z.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute dS_y/dt.\n\n[H', S_y] = [ -gamma B S_y, S_y ] = 0.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_y/dt = (i/\u0127) * 0 = 0.\n\nSo S_y is constant in Heisenberg picture.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so S_y commutes with H', and thus its time derivative is zero. So S_y doesn't change.\n\nSo now, we have the following system of differential equations:\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B S_x\n\ndS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z\n\ndS_y/dt = 0.\n\nHmm, this looks like the equations for a harmonic oscillator. Let me see.\n\nIf I take the second derivative of S_z:\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = d/dt (gamma B S_x) = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B (- gamma B S_z ) = - (gamma B)^2 S_z.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = - (gamma B)^2 S_z.\n\nThe solution to this is S_z(t) = A cos(omega t) + B sin(omega t), where omega is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the equation is d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = - (gamma B)^2 S_z.\n\nSo the angular frequency omega is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, that would imply that the frequency of oscillation is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo <mu_z(t)> = gamma <S_z(t)>.\n\nSo if <S_z(t)> oscillates with frequency gamma B, then <mu_z(t)> also oscillates with the same frequency.\n\nWait, but wait, looking back at the equations:\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B S_x.\n\ndS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z.\n\nSo the system is a coupled oscillator. Let me think about the time dependence.\n\nAssume S_z(0) = S_z0, S_x(0) = 0.\n\nThen, S_z(t) would be S_z0 cos(gamma B t) and S_x(t) = S_z0 sin(gamma B t).\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, wait, the options are given as gamma*B, gamma*B/sqrt(2), etc.\n\nSo option B is gamma*B, which would match this conclusion.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the Heisenberg equations.\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z>, so at t=0, the expectation value of S_z is \u0127/2 (since S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2)|+z> ), and the expectation value of S_x is zero.\n\nSo, let's compute <S_z(t)>.\n\nIn Heisenberg picture, S_z(t) = e^{i H' t / \u0127} S_z e^{-i H' t / \u0127}.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to use the time evolution operator.\n\nWait, another approach: express the initial state |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H'.\n\nH' is proportional to S_y, so its eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +/- (gamma B \u0127/2), perhaps.\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So H' = -gamma B S_y, so eigenvalues are -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2 ) = \u2213 gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nSo the energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E+ = - gamma B ( \u0127/2 ) and E- = gamma B ( \u0127/2 ).\n\nWait, no, because H' = -gamma B S_y, so S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, so H' |+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nSo E+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2 )\n\nSimilarly, H' |-y> = gamma B (\u0127/2) |-y>, so E- = gamma B ( \u0127/2 )\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the energies as E_+ = (- gamma B) (\u0127/2 ), E_- = (+ gamma B) ( \u0127/2 )\n\nWait, no, wait, H' = -gamma B S_y.\n\nSo S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nThus, H' |+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y> => E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2 )\n\nSimilarly, H' |-y> = gamma B (\u0127/2) |-y> => E_- = gamma B ( \u0127/2 )\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe state |+z> in the S_y basis is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nBecause the eigenstates of S_z and S_y are not the same.\n\nSo, |+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>\n\nWe can find a and b by expressing |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of S_y.\n\nThe eigenstates of S_y are |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, no, the standard expressions are:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSimilarly, |-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo yes, the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo when the Hamiltonian changes, the state remains |+z>, which is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the time evolution under H' is each component evolves with their respective phase factors.\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t / \u0127} |-y> ]\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ = (- gamma B) ( \u0127/2 )\nE_- = (+ gamma B) ( \u0127/2 )\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i gamma B t (\u0127/2) / \u0127} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t (\u0127/2) / \u0127} |-y> ]\n\nWait, because E_+ t / \u0127 = (- gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 = - gamma B t / 2\n\nSimilarly, E_- t / \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i (gamma B t / 2) } |+y> + e^{-i (gamma B t / 2) } |-y> ]\n\nBut |+y> and |-y> can be written in terms of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nWait, let me express this in terms of S_z basis.\n\nExpressing |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i (gamma B t / 2) } (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) + e^{-i (gamma B t / 2) } (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |-z>) ) ]\n\nWhere theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ ( e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} ) |+z> + ( e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} ) |-z> ]\n\nUsing Euler's formula: e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos(theta)\nAnd e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin(theta)\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> + 2i sin(theta) |-z> ]\n\n= [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ]\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z>\n\nWhere theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is:\n\n<S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>\n\nCompute this:\n\n= [ cos(theta)* < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ]\n\nSince S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, and S_z |-z> = (- \u0127/2) |-z>.\n\nSo,\n\n= cos(theta) * i sin(theta) * < +z | S_z |-z> + other terms.\n\nWait, let's compute each term:\n\nThe first term is cos(theta) * cos(theta) < +z | S_z | +z > = cos^2(theta) (\u0127/2)\n\nSecond term: cos(theta) * i sin(theta) < +z | S_z | -z >.\n\nBut < +z | S_z | -z > = (\u0127/2) < +z | -z > = 0, because |+z> and |-z> are orthogonal.\n\nThird term: i sin(theta) * cos(theta) < -z | S_z | +z > = 0 for the same reason.\n\nFourth term: i sin(theta) * i sin(theta) < -z | S_z | -z >.\n\n= i^2 sin^2(theta) (\u0127/2 ) = (-1) sin^2(theta) (\u0127/2 )\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = [ cos^2(theta) (\u0127/2) ) ] + [ (- sin^2(theta) ) (\u0127/2 ) ]\n\n= [ (cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ) ] (\u0127/2 )\n\n= cos(2 theta) (\u0127/2 )\n\nBecause cos(2 theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = ( \u0127/2 ) cos( 2 theta )\n\nBut theta = gamma B t / 2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of S_z oscillates with angular frequency gamma B.\n\nBut the question is about the oscillation of the z-component of the magnetic moment, mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z(t) > = gamma < S_z(t) > = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the units here. Wait, because S_z has units of \u0127. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, S_z is in units of \u0127. So, <S_z> is (\u0127/2) times a dimensionless factor.\n\nBut when you compute mu_z, which is gamma times S_z, the units would be appropriate for magnetic moment.\n\nBut regardless, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, the expectation value is oscillating as cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma*B, which would be the answer.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because another approach suggested that the frequency is gamma*B/sqrt(2). Did I miss something?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the Heisenberg equations. Earlier, I found that d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = - (gamma B)^2 S_z, leading to angular frequency gamma B.\n\nIn the state approach, the expectation of S_z oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the same conclusion.\n\nBut why is there an option D, which is gamma B over sqrt(2)? Did I make a mistake in the state approach?\n\nWait, wait in the state approach, <S_z(t)> is (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t), so the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle\u2019s moment, which is mu_z. So, since mu_z = gamma S_z, and <S_z> oscillates with frequency gamma B, then <mu_z> also oscillates with the same frequency.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B, gamma*B.\n\nWait, but wait, another way to think about it is using energy levels. The energy splitting between |+y> and |-y> is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127.\n\nBecause E_+ = - (gamma B) ( \u0127/2 )\n\nE_- = + (gamma B) ( \u0127/2 )\n\nSo the energy difference is gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe frequency of oscillation between these states would be (E_- - E_+)/ \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWhich matches the previous conclusion.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, so the answer is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis\n\n1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  \n   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\\rangle$. When the magnetic field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H' = -\\gamma B S_y$. This Hamiltonian governs the time evolution of the system.\n\n2. **Time Evolution**:  \n   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ is not an eigenstate of $H'$, so the system evolves over time. The eigenstates of $H'$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\\pm \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$. The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$:\n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   Under time evolution, the state becomes:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{-iE_+t/\\hbar} |+y\\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\\hbar} |-y\\rangle \\right),\n   \\]\n   where $E_+ = -\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$ and $E_- = \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$. Substituting the eigenvalues, the time-dependent state becomes:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right)|+z\\rangle + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right)|-z\\rangle.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  \n   The expectation value of $S_z$ is computed as:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle.\n   \\]\n   Substituting $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$ and using the orthonormality of $|+z\\rangle$ and $|-z\\rangle$, the result simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Oscillation of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$**:  \n   The magnetic moment\u2019s $z$-component is $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$. Therefore, the average $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$ oscillates as:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   The oscillation frequency of $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$ is thus $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n5. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  \n   - **Option A ($\\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is $\\gamma B$, not $\\gamma B / 2$.  \n   - **Option B ($\\gamma B$)**: Correct. The oscillation frequency matches the derived result.  \n   - **Option C ($\\sqrt{2} \\gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ in the oscillation frequency.  \n   - **Option D ($\\gamma B / \\sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is $\\gamma B$, not $\\gamma B / \\sqrt{2}$.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$. \n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I need to figure out the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment when the magnetic field is switched from the Z direction to the Y direction. \n\nLet me start by recalling what I know about spin and magnetic moments. A spin-1/2 particle has spin angular momentum S, which can be either up or down. The magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * S_z, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. So when the magnetic field is along the Z-axis, the particle's magnetic moment aligns with it because that's the direction of the field.\n\nThe initial setup is a magnetic field B in the +Z direction. The particle's moment mu is aligned with this, so it's along +Z. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both have the same magnitude, B. Wait, so the magnetic field changes direction from Z to Y. \n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment. It starts oscillating, and we need the frequency of that oscillation. \n\nHmm, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system will change. Initially, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -mu \u00b7 B. Since B was along Z, H_initial = -gamma S_z B. But when the field switches to Y, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -mu \u00b7 B' where B' is along Y. So H_final = -gamma (S \u00b7 Y) B, but since Y is a unit vector, it's proportional to S_y. Wait, wait, more accurately, S is a vector operator, so S \u00b7 Y would be S_x times 0 plus S_y times 1 plus S_z times 0? No, wait, the Y direction is along the second axis, so the dot product would involve S_y times B. So H_final = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but wait. The magnetic moment mu is gamma S, so mu \u00b7 B is gamma (S \u00b7 B). So when B is along Y, mu \u00b7 B = gamma S_y B. So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the new Hamiltonian after the field is applied along Y is H = - gamma B S_y. \n\nNow, the system was initially in an eigenstate of S_z (since the initial field was along Z). The eigenstates of S_z are |+> and |-> with eigenvalues \u0127/2 and -\u0127/2, respectively. But when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian are eigenstates of S_y. \n\nThe system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, so it will evolve in time, causing oscillations in expectation values like <S_z>. \n\nTo find the oscillation frequency, I think I need to find the energy levels of the new Hamiltonian and then find the transition frequencies between these states.\n\nThe eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2, so the energies for the two states are E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). Wait, wait, no: the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. So for S_y eigenstates, when S_y is (\u0127/2) |+y>, H|+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y>, so energy E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2). Similarly, for the |\u2212y> state, E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nSo the energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = [-gamma B (\u0127/2)] - [gamma B (\u0127/2)] = - gamma B \u0127. Wait, but wait, that's the difference, but in terms of frequency, it's \u0394E = E_+ - E_-? Wait no, actually, the energy levels are E_+ and E_-. The transition frequency would be (E_+ - E_-)/\u0127, because frequency is \u0394E / \u0127.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The energy levels are E_+ and E_-, so the difference is E_+ - E_- = -gamma B (\u0127/2) - gamma B (\u0127/2) ) = - gamma B \u0127. But the absolute value would be gamma B \u0127. So the frequency is (E_+ - E_-) / \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) ) / \u0127 = gamma B. But wait, that's the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So the frequency would be gamma B. \n\nBut wait, the system's initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's say the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue \u0127/2. After the field is turned on along Y, the state will evolve under H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Since the Hamiltonian is time-independent, the solution is |\u03c8(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)>.\n\nThe expectation value of S_z at time t is <S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nBut let's compute this expectation value. The initial state is |+z>. So |\u03c8(0)> = |+z>.\n\nThe state at time t is |\u03c8(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |+z>.\n\nH is proportional to S_y, so H = - gamma B S_y. So H = - gamma B ( (S_x + i S_y) / 2i ) ? Wait, no. Wait, S_y is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix sigma_y. So S_y = (\u0127/2) sigma_y.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to express the time evolution operator in terms of the energy eigenstates.\n\nThe energy eigenstates are |+y> and |\u2212y>, which are eigenstates of S_y. So any initial state can be expressed as a linear combination of these.\n\nThe initial state is |+z>. Let's express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>.\n\nThe states |+z> and |+y> are related by a rotation. The rotation from z to y is a 90-degree rotation about the x-axis. So |+y> is a superposition of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nSpecifically, |+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2), and |\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the initial state is (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe time evolution of each eigenstate is multiplied by a phase factor. So |\u03c8(t)> = exp(-i E_+ t / \u0127) (|+y> + exp(-i E_- t / \u0127) |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, wait. Wait, H |+y> = E_+ |+y>, so the phase factor is exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ), and similarly for |\u2212y>.\n\nSo substituting E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2 ), and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2 ), we get:\n\nE_+ = - (gamma B \u0127) / 2\nE_- = (gamma B \u0127) / 2\n\nSo the phases are:\n\nexp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) )\n\nexp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i (gamma B t / 2 ) )\n\nSo |\u03c8(t)> = ( exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, let's express |\u03c8(t)> back in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nWe have |+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting these into |\u03c8(t)>:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ exp(i gamma B t/2 ) (|+z> + |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) (|+z> - |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nFactor out 1/sqrt(2) from both terms:\n\n= [ (exp(i theta) (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) + exp( -i theta ) (|+z> - |\u2212z> )) ) ] / (2)\n\nWhere theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nLet's compute the numerator:\n\nexp(i theta) |+z> + exp(i theta) |\u2212z> + exp( -i theta ) |+z> - exp( -i theta ) |\u2212z>\n\nGroup the |+z> and |\u2212z> terms:\n\n[ exp(i theta) + exp( -i theta ) ] |+z> + [ exp(i theta) - exp( -i theta ) ] |\u2212z>\n\nUsing Euler's formula, exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta) = 2 cos theta, and exp(i theta) - exp(-i theta) = 2i sin theta.\n\nSo numerator becomes:\n\n2 cos theta |+z> + 2i sin theta |\u2212z>\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ 2 cos theta |+z> + 2i sin theta |\u2212z> ] / (2 * sqrt(2) )\n\nWait, wait, I think I messed up the denominator. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, the initial substitution:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ exp(i theta) (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) + exp( -i theta ) (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) ] / (2 )\n\nBecause each |+y> and |\u2212y> term brings a 1/sqrt(2), and the overall division is by sqrt(2) again. So yes, denominator is 2.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ ( exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta) ) |+z> + ( exp(i theta) - exp(-i theta) ) |\u2212z> ] / 2\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n[ 2 cos theta |+z> + 2i sin theta |\u2212z> ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |\u2212z>\n\nSo |\u03c8(t)> = cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |\u2212z>\n\nNow, we need to find the expectation value of S_z. Remember that S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, and S_z |\u2212z> = (- \u0127/2 ) |\u2212z>.\n\nSo <S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n= [ cos theta* , -i sin theta* ] [ (\u0127/2) |+z> , ( - \u0127/2 ) |\u2212z> ] [ cos theta; i sin theta ]\n\nWait, perhaps more clearly:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> is a column vector [ cos theta, i sin theta ]^T, in the basis of |+z>, |\u2212z>.\n\nSo <S_z> = [ cos theta*, -i sin theta* ] ( (\u0127/2) |+z><+z| - (\u0127/2) |\u2212z><\u2212z| ) [ cos theta; i sin theta ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nThe first term: cos theta* * (\u0127/2) * cos theta = (\u0127/2) cos^2 theta.\n\nThe second term: (-i sin theta* ) * ( - \u0127/2 ) * (i sin theta ) = (-i)(-\u0127/2) sin theta* i sin theta.\n\nWait, let me compute each matrix element:\n\nThe matrix S_z in the computational basis is diagonal:\n\nS_z = [ \u0127/2  0\n        0  -\u0127/2 ]\n\nSo the expectation value is:\n\ncos(theta)^2 * (\u0127/2) + (i sin(theta))^2 * (-\u0127/2)\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. The state is |\u03c8(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z>.\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n<\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)> = [ cos(theta), -i sin(theta) ] [ (\u0127/2 0; 0 -\u0127/2) ] [ cos(theta); i sin(theta) ]\n\nWait, no: <\u03c8(t)| is [ cos(theta)* , (-i sin(theta))* ] which is [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ] because theta is real, so cos(theta)* is cos(theta), and (-i sin(theta))* is i sin(theta).\n\nSo multiplying:\n\nFirst element: cos(theta) * (\u0127/2) * cos(theta) = (\u0127/2) cos^2(theta)\nSecond element: cos(theta) * 0 + i sin(theta) * (-\u0127/2) * (i sin(theta)) ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute each component.\n\nWait, matrix multiplication:\n\n<\u03c8(t)| S_z = [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ] [ (\u0127/2, 0), (0, -\u0127/2) ]\n\nWhich gives [ (\u0127/2) cos(theta), ( - \u0127/2 ) i sin(theta) ]\n\nThen, multiply by |\u03c8(t)> which is [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ]^T.\n\nSo:\n\n( (\u0127/2) cos(theta) ) * cos(theta) + ( (- \u0127/2 i sin(theta) ) ) * (i sin(theta) )\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos^2(theta) + ( (- \u0127/2 i sin(theta) ) ) * (i sin(theta) )\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n(- \u0127/2 i ) * i sin^2(theta) \n\nSince i * i = -1, this becomes (- \u0127/2 ) ( -1 ) sin^2(theta) = ( \u0127/2 ) sin^2(theta)\n\nSo overall, <S_z> = (\u0127/2)( cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ) ) = (\u0127/2)(1) = \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the expectation value is oscillating, not constant. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I messed up the time evolution. Let me double-check the expansion of |psi(t)>.\n\nWait, in the expansion, when I expressed |+y> and |\u2212y> in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z>, and then substituted into |psi(t)>, perhaps I made a mistake in the coefficients.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's compute the time evolution without expanding into |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nThe expectation value <S_z> can be found using the time-dependent expectation value formula. For a time-dependent state, the expectation value of an observable O is given by the time derivative involving the Hamiltonian, but perhaps a simpler approach is to use the fact that the system is in a superposition of energy eigenstates.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute <S_z> using the time-evolved state.\n\nWait, let's write the state |psi(t)> as a combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>:\n\n|psi(t)> = ( e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127 } |+y> + e^{-i E_- t/\u0127 } |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nE_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2)\nE_- = gamma B (\u0127/2 )\n\nSo E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127 ) / 2\nE_- = (gamma B \u0127 ) / 2\n\nSo the phases are:\n\ne^{-i E_+ t / \u0127 } = e^{ i gamma B t / 2 }\n\ne^{-i E_- t / \u0127 } = e^{-i gamma B t / 2 }\n\nSo |psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t / 2 } |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } |\u2212y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, S_z can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y> states.\n\nWe know that |+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo S_z |+y> = ( S_z |+z> + S_z |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) = ( (\u0127/2)|+z> - (\u0127/2)|\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2 )\n\nSimilarly, S_z |\u2212y> = ( (\u0127/2)|+z> - ( - \u0127/2)|\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2 ) = ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + (\u0127/2)|\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2 )\n\nWait, no. Let's compute S_z |+y>:\n\nS_z |+y> = S_z (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= [ S_z |+z> + S_z |\u2212z> ] / sqrt(2)\n= [ (\u0127/2)|+z> - (\u0127/2)|\u2212z> ] / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2)( |+z> - |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2 )\n= (\u0127/ (2 sqrt(2)) ) ( |+z> - |\u2212z> )\n\nBut |+z> - |\u2212z> is sqrt(2) |\u2212y>, because:\n\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2 )\n\nSo |+z> - |\u2212z> = sqrt(2) |\u2212y>\n\nThus, S_z |+y> = ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * sqrt(2) |\u2212y> ) = ( \u0127/2 ) |\u2212y>\n\nSimilarly, S_z |\u2212y> = ( \u0127/2 ) |+y>\n\nSo, in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>, the operator S_z is:\n\nS_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) |\u2212y>\nS_z |\u2212y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>\n\nSo, the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y>, |\u2212y> basis is:\n\n[ 0   \u0127/2\n  \u0127/2 0 ]\n\nSo, in this basis, the matrix is [[0, \u0127/2], [\u0127/2, 0]]\n\nNow, the state |psi(t)> is a column vector [ e^{i gamma B t/2 }, e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ]^T / sqrt(2)\n\nSo, to compute <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>, we can write this as:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i gamma B t/2 }, e^{i gamma B t/2 } ] * [[0, \u0127/2], [\u0127/2, 0]] * (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i gamma B t/2 }, e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ]^T\n\nMultiplying this out:\n\nFirst, compute the matrix multiplication:\n\nThe matrix M = [[0, \u0127/2], [\u0127/2, 0]]\n\nSo M * [ e^{i theta}, e^{-i theta} ]^T = [ (\u0127/2) e^{-i theta}, (\u0127/2) e^{i theta} ]^T, where theta = gamma B t/2.\n\nThen, the row vector [ e^{-i theta}, e^{i theta} ] multiplied by this gives:\n\ne^{-i theta} * (\u0127/2) e^{-i theta} + e^{i theta} * (\u0127/2) e^{i theta}\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ e^{-i 2 theta} + e^{i 2 theta} ]\n\nWhich is (\u0127/2) * 2 cos(2 theta) ) = \u0127 cos(2 theta)\n\nSo <S_z> = (1/2) * \u0127 cos(2 theta )\n\nBut theta is gamma B t/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nThus, <S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but wait, the initial state was |+z> and the magnetic moment mu = gamma S_z. So the average of mu_z is gamma times <S_z>. \n\nSo the oscillation is in <mu_z> as (gamma * \u0127/2 ) cos(gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency. The oscillation in <mu_z> is cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that the energy difference was gamma B \u0127, leading to frequency gamma B. So the frequency of oscillation is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the calculation of <S_z>, I found it to be (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the average oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nBut let me check the options. The options are:\n\nA) gamma*B/2\n\nB) gamma*B\n\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the oscillation frequency comes from the energy difference divided by h-bar. The energy levels are E_+ and E_-, which are - (gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) and (gamma B \u0127 / 2 )\n\nThe difference is E_+ - E_- = - gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the transition frequency is (E_+ - E_-) / \u0127 = (- gamma B \u0127 ) / \u0127 = - gamma B. The absolute value gives gamma B.\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B, which matches option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I need to figure out the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment when the magnetic field is switched from the Z direction to the Y direction. \n\nLet me start by recalling what I know about spin and magnetic moments. A spin-1/2 particle has spin angular momentum S, which can be either up or down. The magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * S_z, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. So when the magnetic field is along the Z-axis, the particle's magnetic moment aligns with it because that's the direction of the field.\n\nThe initial setup is a magnetic field B in the +Z direction. The particle's moment mu is aligned with this, so it's along +Z. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both have the same magnitude, B. Wait, so the magnetic field changes direction from Z to Y. \n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment. It starts oscillating, and we need the frequency of that oscillation. \n\nHmm, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system will change. Initially, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -mu \u00b7 B. Since B was along Z, H_initial = -gamma S_z B. But when the field switches to Y, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -mu \u00b7 B' where B' is along Y. So H_final = -gamma (S \u00b7 Y) B, but since Y is a unit vector, it's proportional to S_y. Wait, wait, more accurately, S is a vector operator, so S \u00b7 Y would be S_x times 0 plus S_y times 1 plus S_z times 0? No, wait, the Y direction is along the second axis, so the dot product would involve S_y times B. So H_final = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but wait. The magnetic moment mu is gamma S, so mu \u00b7 B is gamma (S \u00b7 B). So when B is along Y, mu \u00b7 B = gamma S_y B. So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the new Hamiltonian after the field is applied along Y is H = - gamma B S_y. \n\nNow, the system was initially in an eigenstate of S_z (since the initial field was along Z). The eigenstates of S_z are |+> and |-> with eigenvalues \u0127/2 and -\u0127/2, respectively. But when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian are eigenstates of S_y. \n\nThe system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, so it will evolve in time, causing oscillations in expectation values like <S_z>. \n\nTo find the oscillation frequency, I think I need to find the energy levels of the new Hamiltonian and then find the transition frequencies between these states.\n\nThe eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2, so the energies for the two states are E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). Wait, wait, no: the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. So for S_y eigenstates, when S_y is (\u0127/2) |+y>, H|+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y>, so energy E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2). Similarly, for the |\u2212y> state, E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nSo the energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = [-gamma B (\u0127/2)] - [gamma B (\u0127/2)] = - gamma B \u0127. Wait, but wait, that's the difference, but in terms of frequency, it's \u0394E = E_+ - E_-? Wait no, actually, the energy levels are E_+ and E_-. The transition frequency would be (E_+ - E_-)/\u0127, because frequency is \u0394E / \u0127.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The energy levels are E_+ and E_-, so the difference is E_+ - E_- = -gamma B (\u0127/2) - gamma B (\u0127/2) ) = - gamma B \u0127. But the absolute value would be gamma B \u0127. So the frequency is (E_+ - E_-) / \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) ) / \u0127 = gamma B. But wait, that's the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So the frequency would be gamma B. \n\nBut wait, the system's initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's say the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue \u0127/2. After the field is turned on along Y, the state will evolve under H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Since the Hamiltonian is time-independent, the solution is |\u03c8(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)>.\n\nThe expectation value of S_z at time t is <S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nBut let's compute this expectation value. The initial state is |+z>. So |\u03c8(0)> = |+z>.\n\nThe state at time t is |\u03c8(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |+z>.\n\nH is proportional to S_y, so H = - gamma B S_y. So H = - gamma B ( (S_x + i S_y) / 2i ) ? Wait, no. Wait, S_y is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix sigma_y. So S_y = (\u0127/2) sigma_y.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to express the time evolution operator in terms of the energy eigenstates.\n\nThe energy eigenstates are |+y> and |\u2212y>, which are eigenstates of S_y. So any initial state can be expressed as a linear combination of these.\n\nThe initial state is |+z>. Let's express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>.\n\nThe states |+z> and |+y> are related by a rotation. The rotation from z to y is a 90-degree rotation about the x-axis. So |+y> is a superposition of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nSpecifically, |+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2), and |\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the initial state is (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe time evolution of each eigenstate is multiplied by a phase factor. So |\u03c8(t)> = exp(-i E_+ t / \u0127) (|+y> + exp(-i E_- t / \u0127) |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, wait. Wait, H |+y> = E_+ |+y>, so the phase factor is exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ), and similarly for |\u2212y>.\n\nSo substituting E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2 ), and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2 ), we get:\n\nE_+ = - (gamma B \u0127) / 2\nE_- = (gamma B \u0127) / 2\n\nSo the phases are:\n\nexp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) )\n\nexp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i (gamma B t / 2 ) )\n\nSo |\u03c8(t)> = ( exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, let's express |\u03c8(t)> back in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nWe have |+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting these into |\u03c8(t)>:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ exp(i gamma B t/2 ) (|+z> + |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) (|+z> - |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nFactor out 1/sqrt(2) from both terms:\n\n= [ (exp(i theta) (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) + exp( -i theta ) (|+z> - |\u2212z> )) ) ] / (2)\n\nWhere theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nLet's compute the numerator:\n\nexp(i theta) |+z> + exp(i theta) |\u2212z> + exp( -i theta ) |+z> - exp( -i theta ) |\u2212z>\n\nGroup the |+z> and |\u2212z> terms:\n\n[ exp(i theta) + exp( -i theta ) ] |+z> + [ exp(i theta) - exp( -i theta ) ] |\u2212z>\n\nUsing Euler's formula, exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta) = 2 cos theta, and exp(i theta) - exp(-i theta) = 2i sin theta.\n\nSo numerator becomes:\n\n2 cos theta |+z> + 2i sin theta |\u2212z>\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ 2 cos theta |+z> + 2i sin theta |\u2212z> ] / (2 * sqrt(2) )\n\nWait, wait, I think I messed up the denominator. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, the initial substitution:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ exp(i theta) (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) + exp( -i theta ) (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) ] / (2 )\n\nBecause each |+y> and |\u2212y> term brings a 1/sqrt(2), and the overall division is by sqrt(2) again. So yes, denominator is 2.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ ( exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta) ) |+z> + ( exp(i theta) - exp(-i theta) ) |\u2212z> ] / 2\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n[ 2 cos theta |+z> + 2i sin theta |\u2212z> ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |\u2212z>\n\nSo |\u03c8(t)> = cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |\u2212z>\n\nNow, we need to find the expectation value of S_z. Remember that S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, and S_z |\u2212z> = (- \u0127/2 ) |\u2212z>.\n\nSo <S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n= [ cos theta* , -i sin theta* ] [ (\u0127/2) |+z> , ( - \u0127/2 ) |\u2212z> ] [ cos theta; i sin theta ]\n\nWait, perhaps more clearly:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> is a column vector [ cos theta, i sin theta ]^T, in the basis of |+z>, |\u2212z>.\n\nSo <S_z> = [ cos theta*, -i sin theta* ] ( (\u0127/2) |+z><+z| - (\u0127/2) |\u2212z><\u2212z| ) [ cos theta; i sin theta ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nThe first term: cos theta* * (\u0127/2) * cos theta = (\u0127/2) cos^2 theta.\n\nThe second term: (-i sin theta* ) * ( - \u0127/2 ) * (i sin theta ) = (-i)(-\u0127/2) sin theta* i sin theta.\n\nWait, let me compute each matrix element:\n\nThe matrix S_z in the computational basis is diagonal:\n\nS_z = [ \u0127/2  0\n        0  -\u0127/2 ]\n\nSo the expectation value is:\n\ncos(theta)^2 * (\u0127/2) + (i sin(theta))^2 * (-\u0127/2)\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. The state is |\u03c8(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z>.\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n<\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)> = [ cos(theta), -i sin(theta) ] [ (\u0127/2 0; 0 -\u0127/2) ] [ cos(theta); i sin(theta) ]\n\nWait, no: <\u03c8(t)| is [ cos(theta)* , (-i sin(theta))* ] which is [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ] because theta is real, so cos(theta)* is cos(theta), and (-i sin(theta))* is i sin(theta).\n\nSo multiplying:\n\nFirst element: cos(theta) * (\u0127/2) * cos(theta) = (\u0127/2) cos^2(theta)\nSecond element: cos(theta) * 0 + i sin(theta) * (-\u0127/2) * (i sin(theta)) ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute each component.\n\nWait, matrix multiplication:\n\n<\u03c8(t)| S_z = [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ] [ (\u0127/2, 0), (0, -\u0127/2) ]\n\nWhich gives [ (\u0127/2) cos(theta), ( - \u0127/2 ) i sin(theta) ]\n\nThen, multiply by |\u03c8(t)> which is [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ]^T.\n\nSo:\n\n( (\u0127/2) cos(theta) ) * cos(theta) + ( (- \u0127/2 i sin(theta) ) ) * (i sin(theta) )\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos^2(theta) + ( (- \u0127/2 i sin(theta) ) ) * (i sin(theta) )\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n(- \u0127/2 i ) * i sin^2(theta) \n\nSince i * i = -1, this becomes (- \u0127/2 ) ( -1 ) sin^2(theta) = ( \u0127/2 ) sin^2(theta)\n\nSo overall, <S_z> = (\u0127/2)( cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ) ) = (\u0127/2)(1) = \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the expectation value is oscillating, not constant. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I messed up the time evolution. Let me double-check the expansion of |psi(t)>.\n\nWait, in the expansion, when I expressed |+y> and |\u2212y> in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z>, and then substituted into |psi(t)>, perhaps I made a mistake in the coefficients.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's compute the time evolution without expanding into |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nThe expectation value <S_z> can be found using the time-dependent expectation value formula. For a time-dependent state, the expectation value of an observable O is given by the time derivative involving the Hamiltonian, but perhaps a simpler approach is to use the fact that the system is in a superposition of energy eigenstates.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute <S_z> using the time-evolved state.\n\nWait, let's write the state |psi(t)> as a combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>:\n\n|psi(t)> = ( e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127 } |+y> + e^{-i E_- t/\u0127 } |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nE_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2)\nE_- = gamma B (\u0127/2 )\n\nSo E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127 ) / 2\nE_- = (gamma B \u0127 ) / 2\n\nSo the phases are:\n\ne^{-i E_+ t / \u0127 } = e^{ i gamma B t / 2 }\n\ne^{-i E_- t / \u0127 } = e^{-i gamma B t / 2 }\n\nSo |psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t / 2 } |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } |\u2212y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, S_z can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y> states.\n\nWe know that |+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo S_z |+y> = ( S_z |+z> + S_z |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) = ( (\u0127/2)|+z> - (\u0127/2)|\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2 )\n\nSimilarly, S_z |\u2212y> = ( (\u0127/2)|+z> - ( - \u0127/2)|\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2 ) = ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + (\u0127/2)|\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2 )\n\nWait, no. Let's compute S_z |+y>:\n\nS_z |+y> = S_z (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= [ S_z |+z> + S_z |\u2212z> ] / sqrt(2)\n= [ (\u0127/2)|+z> - (\u0127/2)|\u2212z> ] / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2)( |+z> - |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2 )\n= (\u0127/ (2 sqrt(2)) ) ( |+z> - |\u2212z> )\n\nBut |+z> - |\u2212z> is sqrt(2) |\u2212y>, because:\n\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2 )\n\nSo |+z> - |\u2212z> = sqrt(2) |\u2212y>\n\nThus, S_z |+y> = ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * sqrt(2) |\u2212y> ) = ( \u0127/2 ) |\u2212y>\n\nSimilarly, S_z |\u2212y> = ( \u0127/2 ) |+y>\n\nSo, in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>, the operator S_z is:\n\nS_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) |\u2212y>\nS_z |\u2212y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>\n\nSo, the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y>, |\u2212y> basis is:\n\n[ 0   \u0127/2\n  \u0127/2 0 ]\n\nSo, in this basis, the matrix is [[0, \u0127/2], [\u0127/2, 0]]\n\nNow, the state |psi(t)> is a column vector [ e^{i gamma B t/2 }, e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ]^T / sqrt(2)\n\nSo, to compute <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>, we can write this as:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i gamma B t/2 }, e^{i gamma B t/2 } ] * [[0, \u0127/2], [\u0127/2, 0]] * (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i gamma B t/2 }, e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ]^T\n\nMultiplying this out:\n\nFirst, compute the matrix multiplication:\n\nThe matrix M = [[0, \u0127/2], [\u0127/2, 0]]\n\nSo M * [ e^{i theta}, e^{-i theta} ]^T = [ (\u0127/2) e^{-i theta}, (\u0127/2) e^{i theta} ]^T, where theta = gamma B t/2.\n\nThen, the row vector [ e^{-i theta}, e^{i theta} ] multiplied by this gives:\n\ne^{-i theta} * (\u0127/2) e^{-i theta} + e^{i theta} * (\u0127/2) e^{i theta}\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ e^{-i 2 theta} + e^{i 2 theta} ]\n\nWhich is (\u0127/2) * 2 cos(2 theta) ) = \u0127 cos(2 theta)\n\nSo <S_z> = (1/2) * \u0127 cos(2 theta )\n\nBut theta is gamma B t/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nThus, <S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but wait, the initial state was |+z> and the magnetic moment mu = gamma S_z. So the average of mu_z is gamma times <S_z>. \n\nSo the oscillation is in <mu_z> as (gamma * \u0127/2 ) cos(gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency. The oscillation in <mu_z> is cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that the energy difference was gamma B \u0127, leading to frequency gamma B. So the frequency of oscillation is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the calculation of <S_z>, I found it to be (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the average oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nBut let me check the options. The options are:\n\nA) gamma*B/2\n\nB) gamma*B\n\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the oscillation frequency comes from the energy difference divided by h-bar. The energy levels are E_+ and E_-, which are - (gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) and (gamma B \u0127 / 2 )\n\nThe difference is E_+ - E_- = - gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the transition frequency is (E_+ - E_-) / \u0127 = (- gamma B \u0127 ) / \u0127 = - gamma B. The absolute value gives gamma B.\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B, which matches option B.\n\n\nTo determine the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, we analyze the system\u2019s evolution under the changing magnetic field. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle\u2019s magnetic moment aligns with it. The Hamiltonian is proportional to \\( S_z \\), and the eigenstates of \\( S_z \\) are \\( |+z\\rangle \\) and \\( |-z\\rangle \\), with eigenvalues \\( \\pm \\hbar/2 \\).\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the new Hamiltonian becomes \\( H = -\\gamma B S_y \\), where \\( S_y \\) is the spin operator in the Y direction. The eigenstates of \\( S_y \\) are \\( |+y\\rangle \\) and \\( |-y\\rangle \\), with eigenvalues \\( \\pm \\hbar/2 \\). The energy eigenvalues are \\( E_+ = -\\gamma B \\hbar / 2 \\) and \\( E_- = \\gamma B \\hbar / 2 \\), leading to an energy difference \\( \\Delta E = E_+ - E_- = -\\gamma B \\hbar \\).\n\nThe oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference divided by \\( \\hbar \\), which is \\( \\nu = \\Delta E / \\hbar = \\gamma B \\). This frequency corresponds to the oscillation of the expectation value of \\( S_z \\) (and hence the magnetic moment \\( \\mu_z \\)) as the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian.\n\nFrom the calculation, the oscillation frequency is \\( \\gamma B \\), which matches option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.\n\nAlright, the setup is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma * S_z. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm.\n\nWait, so initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The particle's spin is aligned with this field, right? So the system was in an eigenstate of S_z, I suppose. But then the field is switched to Y. So the Hamiltonian must change.\n\nIn the first scenario, when the field is along Z, the Hamiltonian H_initial would be proportional to S_z. Then, when the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. Because the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, and the energy is something like -mu\u00b7B. So the Hamiltonian would be H = -gamma * B * S_z for the first case, and H = -gamma * B * S_y for the second.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. After the field changes to Y, the system's state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, which is proportional to S_y. So the system will start evolving under this new Hamiltonian, leading to time-dependent expectation values.\n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the moment, mu_z. Since mu = gamma S_z, then the average mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of S_z. So we need to find how <S_z> oscillates over time.\n\nI remember that in such situations, the time evolution is governed by the energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. When a two-level system is subjected to a Hamiltonian, the expectation values can oscillate with a frequency determined by the energy difference between the states.\n\nSo let me think about the energy levels. The new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Since S_y is a spin-1/2 operator, its eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u0127/2. But wait, the spin matrices for S_x, S_y, S_z are proportional to the Pauli matrices. So S_y would have eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nWait, but the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2)? Or wait, no. Let me think again. The S_y operator in terms of Pauli matrices is (i/2)(\u03c3_x - \u03c3_y) or something? Wait, maybe I'm getting the exact form wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that the eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the energy levels would be E = -gamma B (S_y) so for S_y = +\u0127/2, E = -gamma B (\u0127/2), and for S_y = -\u0127/2, E = gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) - (gamma B (\u0127/2)) ) = - gamma B \u0127. Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me compute the difference again. E_+ = (-gamma B) * (\u0127/2) and E_- = (-gamma B) * (-\u0127/2) = (gamma B \u0127)/2. So the difference between E_- and E_+ is (gamma B \u0127/2) - (-gamma B \u0127/2) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nWait, but in the time evolution, the energy levels determine the phases. The frequency of oscillation is related to the energy difference divided by \u0127. Because the time dependence of the state is exponential with E t / \u0127. So the transition frequency between two states would be (E2 - E1)/(\u0127).\n\nIn this case, the energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127)/2 and E_- = (gamma B \u0127)/2. So the energy difference between the two is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2) - (- gamma B \u0127/2 ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the frequency would be (E_- - E_+)/\u0127 = gamma B \u0127 / \u0127 = gamma B. But wait, that's the same as the original frequency when the field was along Z. But wait, that can't be right because the original setup was along Z, and the new setup is along Y. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the energies. Let me think again. The Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (s), where s is the eigenvalue of S_y. S_y for spin-1/2 has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energy difference is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2) - (- gamma B \u0127/2 ) = gamma B \u0127. So the frequency is (gamma B \u0127)/(\u0127) ) = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency would be gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment. So how does this relate to the energy levels?\n\nThe initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's say it's |+z> (spin up along Z). When the field is turned off and the new field is applied along Y, the system is in state |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of H = -gamma B S_y. So the state will evolve over time.\n\nThe time evolution is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The state can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of H. The energy eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of S_y, which are |+y> and |\u2212y>. So the initial state |+z> can be expressed as a combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>.\n\nLet me write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>. The states |+y> and |\u2212y> can be expressed in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z> as follows:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>, let's invert these equations.\n\nLet me write:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/\u221a2\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z>)/\u221a2\n\nIf I add these two equations:\n\n|+y> + |\u2212y> = (2 |+z> ) /\u221a2 \u2192 (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) = sqrt(2) |+z>\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the equations:\n\n|+y> - |\u2212y> = (2 |\u2212z> ) /\u221a2 \u2192 (|+y> - |\u2212y> ) = sqrt(2) |\u2212z>\n\nSo, |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2)\nAnd |\u2212z> = (|+y> - |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the time evolution under H is such that each eigenstate |+y> and |\u2212y> evolves with a phase factor e^(-i E t / \u0127 ), where E is the energy eigenvalue.\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n\u03c8(t) = (|+y> e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} + |\u2212y> e^{-i E_- t/\u0127} ) / sqrt(2)\n\nPlugging in the energies:\n\nE_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2)\nE_- = gamma B (\u0127/2)\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = ( |+y> e^{i gamma B t (\u0127/2) / \u0127 } + |\u2212y> e^{ -i gamma B t (\u0127/2) / \u0127 } ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\ngamma B (\u0127/2) / \u0127 = gamma B / 2. So,\n\n\u03c8(t) = ( |+y> e^{i (gamma B / 2 ) t } + |\u2212y> e^{ -i (gamma B / 2 ) t } ) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we want to find the expectation value of S_z in this state. Let's compute <S_z>.\n\nSince S_z is (\u0127/2) |+z><+z| - (\u0127/2) |\u2212z><\u2212z|.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to express \u03c8(t) in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z>, then compute <S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nWait, from earlier, we have |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2), and |\u2212z> = (|+y> - |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo let's express \u03c8(t) in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nWait, from \u03c8(t) = ( |+y> e^{i (gamma B / 2 ) t } + |\u2212y> e^{ -i (gamma B / 2 ) t } ) / sqrt(2)\n\nLet me substitute |+y> and |\u2212y> in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z>:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2)\n\nSo substituting into \u03c8(t):\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ (|+z> + |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) * e^{i (gamma B/2) t} + (|+z> - |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) * e^{ -i (gamma B/2) t} ] / sqrt(2)\n\nLet me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from each term:\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) e^{i theta} + 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) e^{-i theta} ] / sqrt(2)\nWhere theta = (gamma B/2) t.\n\nSo, combining the terms:\n\n= [ (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) e^{i theta} + (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) e^{-i theta} ) ] / (2 )\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= [ |+z> (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) + |\u2212z> (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula, e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos theta, and e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin theta.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ |+z> * 2 cos theta + |\u2212z> * 2i sin theta ] / 2\n= [ |+z> cos theta + i |\u2212z> sin theta ]\n\nSo, \u03c8(t) = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z>, where theta = (gamma B/2) t.\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is:\n\n<S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\nSince S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, and S_z |\u2212z> = -(\u0127/2) |\u2212z>.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = [ cos(theta) < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] * S_z * [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z> ]\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n= cos(theta)^2 (\u0127/2) < +z | +z > \n+ i cos(theta) sin(theta) (\u0127/2) < +z | -z > \n+ i sin(theta) cos(theta) (-\u0127/2) < -z | +z > \n+ (i sin(theta))^2 (-\u0127/2) < -z | -z > \n\nBut < +z | -z > = 0, and < +z | +z > = 1, same for < -z | -z > =1.\n\nSo,\n\n= cos^2(theta) (\u0127/2) \n+ 0 \n+ 0 \n+ (i^2 sin^2(theta)) (-\u0127/2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) - (-1) sin^2(theta) ]\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ]\n= (\u0127/2) (1)\n= \u0127/2\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply <S_z> is a constant, which doesn't oscillate. But the problem says the average starts oscillating. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nHmm. Let me check again.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me redo the calculation.\n\nWait, S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, and S_z |\u2212z> = (-\u0127/2) |\u2212z>.\n\nSo,\n\n[ cos(theta) < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] * S_z * [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z> ]\n\n= cos(theta) < +z | S_z | +z > cos(theta) |+z> \n+ cos(theta) < +z | S_z | \u2212z > i sin(theta) |\u2212z>\n+ i sin(theta) < \u2212z | S_z | +z > cos(theta) |+z>\n+ i sin(theta) < \u2212z | S_z | \u2212z > i sin(theta) |\u2212z>\n\nEach term:\n\n1. cos(theta)^2 (\u0127/2) < +z | +z > = cos^2(theta) * (\u0127/2)\n2. cos(theta) * i sin(theta) < +z | S_z | -z > < -z | -z > \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me correct the expansion.\n\nWait, the operator S_z is applied to the ket vector, so:\n\nEach term is:\n\n< a | S_z | b > multiplied by the coefficients.\n\nSo the first term is cos(theta) * cos(theta) * < +z | S_z | +z >.\n\nSimilarly, the second term is cos(theta) * i sin(theta) * < +z | S_z | -z >.\n\nThird term: i sin(theta) * cos(theta) * < -z | S_z | +z >.\n\nFourth term: i sin(theta) * i sin(theta) * < -z | S_z | -z >.\n\nNow, compute each:\n\n1. < +z | S_z | +z > = \u0127/2. So term 1 is cos\u00b2(theta) * (\u0127/2).\n\n2. < +z | S_z | -z > = 0, since S_z | -z > = (-\u0127/2)| -z >, and < +z | -z > is zero. So term 2 is zero.\n\n3. < -z | S_z | +z > = 0, same reason. So term 3 is zero.\n\n4. < -z | S_z | -z > = (-\u0127/2). So term 4 is (i^2) sin^2(theta) * (-\u0127/2) = (-1) sin^2(theta) (-\u0127/2) = sin^2(theta) (\u0127/2).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n<S_z> = [ cos\u00b2(theta) (\u0127/2) ] + [ 0 ] + [0 ] + [ sin\u00b2(theta) (\u0127/2) ]\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) ( cos\u00b2(theta) + sin\u00b2(theta) ) = (\u0127/2)(1) = \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So the expectation value of S_z is \u0127/2, a constant. That can't be right because the problem says the average starts oscillating. Did I make a mistake in the state expansion?\n\nWait a second. I think I messed up the phase factors. Let me double-check the time evolution.\n\nWait, the time evolution of each eigenstate |+y> and |\u2212y> is given by e^(-i E t / \u0127 ). So,\n\nE_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), so E_+ t / \u0127 = (-gamma B (\u0127/2) t ) / \u0127 = - gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo, e^(-i E_+ t / \u0127 ) = e^{i gamma B t / 2}.\n\nSimilarly, E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2 ), so E_- t / \u0127 = (gamma B (\u0127/2) t ) / \u0127 = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo, e^(-i E_- t / \u0127 ) = e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 }.\n\nSo when I wrote \u03c8(t), the exponents were correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in expressing the initial state. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of S_z in a different way.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the time evolution is under H = - gamma B S_y, the state evolves as |\u03c8(t)> = e^{-i H t / \u0127} |+z>.\n\nSo,\n\nH = - gamma B S_y.\n\nExpressing S_y in terms of Pauli matrices: S_y = (\u0127/2) (\u03c3_x - i \u03c3_y)/2? Wait, no. Wait, the Pauli matrices are defined as \u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], \u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nThe spin operator S for spin-1/2 is (\u0127/2) \u03c3.\n\nSo, S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.\n\nSo H = - gamma B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.\n\nSo,\n\nH = - (gamma B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3_y.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U = e^{-i H t / \u0127}.\n\nSubstituting H:\n\nU = e^{ i (gamma B / 2 ) \u03c3_y t }\n\nBecause:\n\nH t / \u0127 = [ - (gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) \u03c3_y ] t / \u0127 = - gamma B t/(2) \u03c3_y.\n\nSo,\n\nU = e^{ i (gamma B t/(2)) \u03c3_y }.\n\nNow, to compute U |+z>, which is the state at time t.\n\nThe state |+z> is the spin-up state along z, represented as a vector [1; 0].\n\nLet me compute U |+z>.\n\nThe matrix exponential e^{i theta \u03c3_y} can be written using the identity that for any Pauli matrix \u03c3 and angle theta,\n\ne^{i theta \u03c3} = I cos(theta) + i sigma sin(theta).\n\nSo, for sigma_y and theta = (gamma B t)/(2):\n\nU = e^{i theta sigma_y} = I cos(theta) + i sigma_y sin(theta).\n\nSo,\n\nU = [[ cos(theta) , i sin(theta) ],\n      [ -i sin(theta), cos(theta) ] ]\n\nSo, applying U to |+z> = [1; 0]:\n\nU |+z> = [ cos(theta) * 1 + i sin(theta) * 0,\n          (-i sin(theta)) * 1 + cos(theta) * 0 ]\n= [ cos(theta), -i sin(theta) ]\n\nSo, the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)> = [ cos(theta), -i sin(theta) ]^T, where theta = (gamma B t)/2.\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nS_z is (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nSo,\n\n<\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)> = (\u0127/2) [ [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ] [[1,0],[0,-1]] [ cos(theta), -i sin(theta) ] ]\n\nWait, let's compute it step by step.\n\nCompute S_z |\u03c8(t)>:\n\nS_z |\u03c8(t)> = (\u0127/2) [ [ cos(theta), 0 ],\n                     [ 0, -1 ] [ -i sin(theta) ] ]\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ]^T.\n\nThen, <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)> is the inner product of \u03c8(t) and S_z \u03c8(t):\n\n= [ cos(theta) , -i sin(theta) ] [ (\u0127/2) cos(theta), (\u0127/2) i sin(theta) ) ]\n\nWait, actually, let me compute the components:\n\nCompute each term:\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos(theta) * cos(theta) + (-i sin(theta)) * (i sin(theta)) ]\n\nBecause:\n\nFirst component: cos(theta) * (\u0127/2) cos(theta)\nSecond component: (-i sin(theta)) * (\u0127/2) (i sin(theta)) )\n\nWait, no, let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, the inner product is:\n\n[ cos(theta), -i sin(theta) ] * (\u0127/2) [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ]^T.\n\nWhich is (\u0127/2) [ cos(theta) * cos(theta) + (-i sin(theta)) * (i sin(theta)) ]\n\nCompute each part:\n\ncos(theta) * cos(theta) = cos^2(theta).\n\n(-i sin(theta)) * (i sin(theta)) = (-i)(i) sin^2(theta) = ( (-i)(i) ) sin^2(theta) = ( (-i^2) ) sin^2(theta) = ( -(-1) ) sin^2(theta) = sin^2(theta).\n\nSo the sum is cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) * 1 = \u0127/2.\n\nHmm, same result again. But according to the problem statement, the average starts oscillating, which suggests that <S_z> is varying with time. But according to my calculations, it's a constant. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the initial state. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of the magnetic moment mu_z, which is gamma times S_z.\n\nWait, the magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma S_z.\n\nSo, the average mu_z is gamma times <S_z>.\n\nIn my calculation, <S_z> is \u0127/2, so mu_z would be gamma * (\u0127/2).\n\nBut wait, that's a constant, not oscillating. So something's wrong because the problem states that the average oscillates.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the state after the field change. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the problem isn't about the expectation value of S_z, but the oscillation of the magnetic moment's z-component, which is related to the spin precession.\n\nWait, when the magnetic field changes from Z to Y, the spin starts precessing around the new field direction. The frequency of precession is determined by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. But that's for a magnetic field along a fixed axis. Wait, but in this case, the field is along Y. So perhaps the precession frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, when the field is along Y, the spin's precession would cause the expectation value of S_z to oscillate. So why in my earlier calculation did I get a constant?\n\nHmm. Let me think about another approach. Maybe using the Heisenberg picture.\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the state doesn't evolve, and the operators do. So, S_z(t) = e^{i H t/\u0127} S_z e^{-i H t/\u0127}.\n\nH is proportional to S_y. So,\n\nH = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo,\n\nS_z(t) = e^{i (gamma B S_y t / \u0127 )} S_z e^{ -i (gamma B S_y t / \u0127 ) }.\n\nWe can compute this using the commutation relations or using rotation operators.\n\nSince S_y generates rotations around the Y-axis, the operator e^{i theta S_y} would rotate the spin around Y by angle theta.\n\nThe rotation operator around Y by angle theta is R_y(theta) = e^{-i theta S_y/\u0127}.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that S_z(t) will precess around the Y-axis. The time derivative of S_z(t) can be found using the Heisenberg equation:\n\ndS_z(t)/dt = (i/\u0127) [H, S_z(t)].\n\nBut H = - gamma B S_y, so:\n\ndS_z(t)/dt = (i/\u0127)( - gamma B S_y, S_z )\n\nThe commutator [S_y, S_z] is i \u0127 S_x.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_z(t)/dt = (i/\u0127)( - gamma B (i \u0127 S_x) ) )\n= (i)( - gamma B ) (i S_x ) )\n= (i)(i) gamma B S_x\n= (-1) gamma B S_x.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_z/dt = - gamma B S_x.\n\nSimilarly, taking the time derivative again,\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = - gamma B dS_x/dt.\n\nAnd,\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/\u0127) [H, S_x] = (i/\u0127)( - gamma B S_y, S_x )\n\nThe commutator [S_y, S_x] = i \u0127 S_z.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/\u0127)( - gamma B (i \u0127 S_z ) )\n= (i)( - gamma B ) (i S_z )\n= (i)(i) gamma B S_z\n= (-1) gamma B S_z.\n\nPutting it back into the second derivative:\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = - gamma B ( - gamma B S_z )\n= (gamma B)^2 S_z.\n\nThis is a differential equation:\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = (gamma B)^2 S_z.\n\nThe solution to this is S_z(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t).\n\nBut in the Heisenberg picture, at t=0, S_z(0) = S_z. Also, the initial derivative at t=0 is dS_z/dt = - gamma B S_x(0).\n\nAt t=0, S_x(0) = S_x. So,\n\ndS_z/dt (0) = - gamma B S_x.\n\nSo, the solution should involve S_x.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write the Heisenberg equation in terms of expectation values. The expectation value of S_z(t) is <S_z(t)>.\n\nUsing the Heisenberg equation, the time derivative of <S_z(t)> is <dS_z/dt> = - gamma B <S_x>.\n\nBut we can write a system of equations for <S_x>, <S_y>, <S_z>.\n\nLet me define the expectation values as x = <S_x>, y = <S_y>, z = <S_z>.\n\nFrom the Heisenberg equations:\n\ndx/dt = (i/\u0127) < [H, S_x] > \n= (i/\u0127)( - gamma B < [S_y, S_x] > )\n= (i/\u0127)( - gamma B (i \u0127) < S_z > )\n= (i)( - gamma B i ) <S_z>\n= (gamma B ) <S_z>\n\nSimilarly,\n\ndy/dt = (i/\u0127) < [H, S_y] > \n= (i/\u0127)( - gamma B < [S_y, S_y] > )\n= 0.\n\ndz/dt = (i/\u0127) < [H, S_z] > \n= (i/\u0127)( - gamma B < [S_y, S_z] > )\n= (i/\u0127)( - gamma B (i \u0127) <S_x> )\n= (i)( - gamma B i ) <S_x>\n= (gamma B) <S_x>\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\ndx/dt = gamma B z\ndy/dt = 0\ndz/dt = gamma B x\n\nWe can write this as a system:\n\nd/dt [x; z] = gamma B [0, 1; 1, 0 ] [x; z]\n\nThis is a coupled differential equation. Let me write it as:\n\nd/dt [x; z] = gamma B ( [z; x] )\n\nWe can write this system as:\n\nd\u00b2x/dt\u00b2 = gamma B dz/dt = gamma B (gamma B x) ) = (gamma B)^2 x.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2x/dt\u00b2 = (gamma B)^2 x.\n\nThe solution is x(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t).\n\nSimilarly for z(t), but perhaps it's better to express this in terms of amplitude and phase.\n\nThe system of equations can be represented as:\n\nx(t) = C cos(gamma B t - phi)\nz(t) = C cos(gamma B t + phi)\n\nWait, but the initial conditions are important. At t=0, the initial state is |+z>, so <S_z> = \u0127/2, and <S_x> = <S_y> = 0.\n\nSo, at t=0:\n\nx(0) = 0,\nz(0) = \u0127/2.\n\nSo, for x(t):\n\nx(t) = 0 * cos(...) + something.\n\nWait, let me solve the system.\n\nWe can write the system in matrix form:\n\nd/dt [x; z] = gamma B [0 1; 1 0 ] [x; z]\n\nThe eigenvalues of the matrix [0 1; 1 0 ] are \u00b11.\n\nSo, the system has solutions involving e^{gamma B t} and e^{-gamma B t}.\n\nWait, perhaps I can diagonalize the matrix.\n\nThe matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which has eigenvalues 1 and -1.\n\nThe eigenvectors are [1,1] and [1,-1].\n\nSo, the solution can be written as:\n\n[x; z] = A e^{gamma B t} [1;1] + B e^{-gamma B t} [1;-1]\n\nApplying initial conditions:\n\nAt t=0, x=0, z= \u0127/2.\n\nSo,\n\n[0; \u0127/2] = A [1;1] + B [1;-1]\n\nWhich gives:\n\n0 = A + B,\n\u0127/2 = A - B.\n\nFrom the first equation, B = -A.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\n\u0127/2 = A - (-A) = 2A \u2192 A = \u0127/4.\n\nSo,\n\n[x; z] = (\u0127/4) e^{gamma B t} [1;1] - (\u0127/4) e^{-gamma B t} [1;-1]\n\nSo,\n\nx(t) = (\u0127/4) ( e^{gamma B t} - e^{-gamma B t} ) ) = (\u0127/4) ( 2 sinh(gamma B t) ) ) = (\u0127/2) sinh(gamma B t).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the sinh function grows without bound, which isn't physical. So perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.\n\nWait, let me re-express the solution:\n\n[x; z] = A e^{gamma B t} [1;1] + B e^{-gamma B t} [1;-1].\n\nAt t=0:\n\n0 = A + B,\n\u0127/2 = A - B.\n\nSo,\n\nFrom 0 = A + B \u2192 B = -A.\n\nSubstituting into \u0127/2 = A - B \u2192 \u0127/2 = A - (-A) \u2192 \u0127/2 = 2A \u2192 A = \u0127/4.\n\nSo,\n\nx(t) = (\u0127/4) e^{gamma B t} (1) + (-\u0127/4) e^{-gamma B t} (1) \n= (\u0127/4) [ e^{gamma B t} - e^{-gamma B t} ] \n= (\u0127/2) sinh(gamma B t).\n\nSimilarly,\n\nz(t) = (\u0127/4) e^{gamma B t} (1) + (-\u0127/4) e^{-gamma B t} (-1) \n= (\u0127/4) e^{gamma B t} + (\u0127/4) e^{-gamma B t}\n= (\u0127/2) cosh(gamma B t).\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because when t increases, x grows exponentially, which doesn't make sense for expectation values of spin components, which are bounded.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me check the system again.\n\nThe equations were:\n\ndx/dt = gamma B z,\ndz/dt = gamma B x.\n\nAt t=0, x=0, z= \u0127/2.\n\nLet me try solving them as differential equations.\n\nLet me write dz/dt = gamma B x.\n\nBut from dx/dt = gamma B z,\n\nSo, substituting x from dx/dt into dz/dt:\n\ndz/dt = gamma B x = gamma B (dx/dt / (gamma B z )) ) \u2192 dz/dt = dx/dt / z.\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, write this as d\u00b2z/dt\u00b2 = gamma B dx/dt = gamma B (gamma B z ) \u2192 d\u00b2z/dt\u00b2 = (gamma B)^2 z.\n\nSo,\n\nz(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t).\n\nAt t=0,\n\nz(0) = \u0127/2 \u2192 A = \u0127/2.\n\ndz/dt(0) = gamma B x(0) = 0 \u2192 B * gamma B * (0) = 0 \u2192 B can be any value? Wait, no, because dz/dt(0) = 0.\n\nWait, let me compute dz/dt(0):\n\ndz/dt(0) = gamma B x(0) = gamma B * 0 = 0.\n\nSo,\n\nz(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t).\n\nAnd from dz/dt = gamma B x \u2192 x = dz/dt / gamma B.\n\nSo,\n\nx(t) = [ - (gamma B) (\u0127/2) sin(gamma B t) + B gamma B cos(gamma B t) ] / gamma B\n= - (\u0127/2) sin(gamma B t) + B cos(gamma B t).\n\nBut at t=0, x(0)=0 \u2192 0 = -0 + B cos(0) \u2192 B = 0.\n\nSo,\n\nz(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t),\nx(t) = - (\u0127/2) sin(gamma B t).\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nAh, there it is! So the expectation value of S_z oscillates with angular frequency gamma B. So the average of mu_z, which is gamma <S_z>, would be gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the average of the z-component of the particle's moment (mu_z) oscillates. So mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma < S_z > = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos(gamma B t ).\n\nThe oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, looking back at the Heisenberg solution, the frequency is gamma B. But earlier, when I computed the state in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, I got a constant expectation value. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial state expansion. Let me think: in the Schr\u00f6dinger approach, I found <S_z> = \u0127/2, which is a constant, but according to the Heisenberg approach, it oscillates as (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t). So there must be a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Schr\u00f6dinger approach's calculation. Let me re-express the state and recompute <S_z>.\n\nIn the Schr\u00f6dinger approach, the state at time t is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ cos(theta), -i sin(theta) ]^T, where theta = (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ] ( (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] ) [ cos(theta), -i sin(theta) ]^T.\n\nCompute this:\n\nFirst component: cos(theta) * (\u0127/2) * 1 * cos(theta) \u2192 (\u0127/2) cos^2(theta)\nSecond component: (i sin(theta)) * (\u0127/2) * (-1) * (-i sin(theta)) \u2192 (i sin(theta)) (\u0127/2) (i sin(theta)) ) \u2192 (i^2) (\u0127/2) sin^2(theta) \u2192 (-1) (\u0127/2) sin^2(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = (\u0127/2) cos^2(theta) - (\u0127/2) sin^2(theta)\n= (\u0127/2) (cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta))\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta).\n\nBecause cos(2 theta) = cos\u00b2(theta) - sin\u00b2(theta).\n\nAh! So I made a mistake earlier. The correct expectation value is (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta), where theta is (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = (\u0127/2) cos( 2 * (gamma B t / 2 ) ) ) = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nWhich matches the Heisenberg result.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which corresponds to option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.\n\nAlright, the setup is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma * S_z. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm.\n\nWait, so initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The particle's spin is aligned with this field, right? So the system was in an eigenstate of S_z, I suppose. But then the field is switched to Y. So the Hamiltonian must change.\n\nIn the first scenario, when the field is along Z, the Hamiltonian H_initial would be proportional to S_z. Then, when the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. Because the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, and the energy is something like -mu\u00b7B. So the Hamiltonian would be H = -gamma * B * S_z for the first case, and H = -gamma * B * S_y for the second.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. After the field changes to Y, the system's state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, which is proportional to S_y. So the system will start evolving under this new Hamiltonian, leading to time-dependent expectation values.\n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the moment, mu_z. Since mu = gamma S_z, then the average mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of S_z. So we need to find how <S_z> oscillates over time.\n\nI remember that in such situations, the time evolution is governed by the energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. When a two-level system is subjected to a Hamiltonian, the expectation values can oscillate with a frequency determined by the energy difference between the states.\n\nSo let me think about the energy levels. The new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Since S_y is a spin-1/2 operator, its eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u0127/2. But wait, the spin matrices for S_x, S_y, S_z are proportional to the Pauli matrices. So S_y would have eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nWait, but the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2)? Or wait, no. Let me think again. The S_y operator in terms of Pauli matrices is (i/2)(\u03c3_x - \u03c3_y) or something? Wait, maybe I'm getting the exact form wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that the eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the energy levels would be E = -gamma B (S_y) so for S_y = +\u0127/2, E = -gamma B (\u0127/2), and for S_y = -\u0127/2, E = gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) - (gamma B (\u0127/2)) ) = - gamma B \u0127. Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me compute the difference again. E_+ = (-gamma B) * (\u0127/2) and E_- = (-gamma B) * (-\u0127/2) = (gamma B \u0127)/2. So the difference between E_- and E_+ is (gamma B \u0127/2) - (-gamma B \u0127/2) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nWait, but in the time evolution, the energy levels determine the phases. The frequency of oscillation is related to the energy difference divided by \u0127. Because the time dependence of the state is exponential with E t / \u0127. So the transition frequency between two states would be (E2 - E1)/(\u0127).\n\nIn this case, the energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127)/2 and E_- = (gamma B \u0127)/2. So the energy difference between the two is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2) - (- gamma B \u0127/2 ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the frequency would be (E_- - E_+)/\u0127 = gamma B \u0127 / \u0127 = gamma B. But wait, that's the same as the original frequency when the field was along Z. But wait, that can't be right because the original setup was along Z, and the new setup is along Y. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the energies. Let me think again. The Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (s), where s is the eigenvalue of S_y. S_y for spin-1/2 has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energy difference is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2) - (- gamma B \u0127/2 ) = gamma B \u0127. So the frequency is (gamma B \u0127)/(\u0127) ) = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency would be gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment. So how does this relate to the energy levels?\n\nThe initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's say it's |+z> (spin up along Z). When the field is turned off and the new field is applied along Y, the system is in state |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of H = -gamma B S_y. So the state will evolve over time.\n\nThe time evolution is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The state can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of H. The energy eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of S_y, which are |+y> and |\u2212y>. So the initial state |+z> can be expressed as a combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>.\n\nLet me write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>. The states |+y> and |\u2212y> can be expressed in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z> as follows:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>, let's invert these equations.\n\nLet me write:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/\u221a2\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z>)/\u221a2\n\nIf I add these two equations:\n\n|+y> + |\u2212y> = (2 |+z> ) /\u221a2 \u2192 (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) = sqrt(2) |+z>\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the equations:\n\n|+y> - |\u2212y> = (2 |\u2212z> ) /\u221a2 \u2192 (|+y> - |\u2212y> ) = sqrt(2) |\u2212z>\n\nSo, |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2)\nAnd |\u2212z> = (|+y> - |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the time evolution under H is such that each eigenstate |+y> and |\u2212y> evolves with a phase factor e^(-i E t / \u0127 ), where E is the energy eigenvalue.\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n\u03c8(t) = (|+y> e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} + |\u2212y> e^{-i E_- t/\u0127} ) / sqrt(2)\n\nPlugging in the energies:\n\nE_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2)\nE_- = gamma B (\u0127/2)\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = ( |+y> e^{i gamma B t (\u0127/2) / \u0127 } + |\u2212y> e^{ -i gamma B t (\u0127/2) / \u0127 } ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\ngamma B (\u0127/2) / \u0127 = gamma B / 2. So,\n\n\u03c8(t) = ( |+y> e^{i (gamma B / 2 ) t } + |\u2212y> e^{ -i (gamma B / 2 ) t } ) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we want to find the expectation value of S_z in this state. Let's compute <S_z>.\n\nSince S_z is (\u0127/2) |+z><+z| - (\u0127/2) |\u2212z><\u2212z|.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to express \u03c8(t) in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z>, then compute <S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nWait, from earlier, we have |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2), and |\u2212z> = (|+y> - |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo let's express \u03c8(t) in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nWait, from \u03c8(t) = ( |+y> e^{i (gamma B / 2 ) t } + |\u2212y> e^{ -i (gamma B / 2 ) t } ) / sqrt(2)\n\nLet me substitute |+y> and |\u2212y> in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z>:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2)\n\nSo substituting into \u03c8(t):\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ (|+z> + |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) * e^{i (gamma B/2) t} + (|+z> - |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) * e^{ -i (gamma B/2) t} ] / sqrt(2)\n\nLet me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from each term:\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) e^{i theta} + 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) e^{-i theta} ] / sqrt(2)\nWhere theta = (gamma B/2) t.\n\nSo, combining the terms:\n\n= [ (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) e^{i theta} + (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) e^{-i theta} ) ] / (2 )\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= [ |+z> (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) + |\u2212z> (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula, e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos theta, and e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin theta.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ |+z> * 2 cos theta + |\u2212z> * 2i sin theta ] / 2\n= [ |+z> cos theta + i |\u2212z> sin theta ]\n\nSo, \u03c8(t) = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z>, where theta = (gamma B/2) t.\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is:\n\n<S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\nSince S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, and S_z |\u2212z> = -(\u0127/2) |\u2212z>.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = [ cos(theta) < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] * S_z * [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z> ]\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n= cos(theta)^2 (\u0127/2) < +z | +z > \n+ i cos(theta) sin(theta) (\u0127/2) < +z | -z > \n+ i sin(theta) cos(theta) (-\u0127/2) < -z | +z > \n+ (i sin(theta))^2 (-\u0127/2) < -z | -z > \n\nBut < +z | -z > = 0, and < +z | +z > = 1, same for < -z | -z > =1.\n\nSo,\n\n= cos^2(theta) (\u0127/2) \n+ 0 \n+ 0 \n+ (i^2 sin^2(theta)) (-\u0127/2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) - (-1) sin^2(theta) ]\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ]\n= (\u0127/2) (1)\n= \u0127/2\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply <S_z> is a constant, which doesn't oscillate. But the problem says the average starts oscillating. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nHmm. Let me check again.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me redo the calculation.\n\nWait, S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, and S_z |\u2212z> = (-\u0127/2) |\u2212z>.\n\nSo,\n\n[ cos(theta) < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] * S_z * [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z> ]\n\n= cos(theta) < +z | S_z | +z > cos(theta) |+z> \n+ cos(theta) < +z | S_z | \u2212z > i sin(theta) |\u2212z>\n+ i sin(theta) < \u2212z | S_z | +z > cos(theta) |+z>\n+ i sin(theta) < \u2212z | S_z | \u2212z > i sin(theta) |\u2212z>\n\nEach term:\n\n1. cos(theta)^2 (\u0127/2) < +z | +z > = cos^2(theta) * (\u0127/2)\n2. cos(theta) * i sin(theta) < +z | S_z | -z > < -z | -z > \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me correct the expansion.\n\nWait, the operator S_z is applied to the ket vector, so:\n\nEach term is:\n\n< a | S_z | b > multiplied by the coefficients.\n\nSo the first term is cos(theta) * cos(theta) * < +z | S_z | +z >.\n\nSimilarly, the second term is cos(theta) * i sin(theta) * < +z | S_z | -z >.\n\nThird term: i sin(theta) * cos(theta) * < -z | S_z | +z >.\n\nFourth term: i sin(theta) * i sin(theta) * < -z | S_z | -z >.\n\nNow, compute each:\n\n1. < +z | S_z | +z > = \u0127/2. So term 1 is cos\u00b2(theta) * (\u0127/2).\n\n2. < +z | S_z | -z > = 0, since S_z | -z > = (-\u0127/2)| -z >, and < +z | -z > is zero. So term 2 is zero.\n\n3. < -z | S_z | +z > = 0, same reason. So term 3 is zero.\n\n4. < -z | S_z | -z > = (-\u0127/2). So term 4 is (i^2) sin^2(theta) * (-\u0127/2) = (-1) sin^2(theta) (-\u0127/2) = sin^2(theta) (\u0127/2).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n<S_z> = [ cos\u00b2(theta) (\u0127/2) ] + [ 0 ] + [0 ] + [ sin\u00b2(theta) (\u0127/2) ]\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) ( cos\u00b2(theta) + sin\u00b2(theta) ) = (\u0127/2)(1) = \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So the expectation value of S_z is \u0127/2, a constant. That can't be right because the problem says the average starts oscillating. Did I make a mistake in the state expansion?\n\nWait a second. I think I messed up the phase factors. Let me double-check the time evolution.\n\nWait, the time evolution of each eigenstate |+y> and |\u2212y> is given by e^(-i E t / \u0127 ). So,\n\nE_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), so E_+ t / \u0127 = (-gamma B (\u0127/2) t ) / \u0127 = - gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo, e^(-i E_+ t / \u0127 ) = e^{i gamma B t / 2}.\n\nSimilarly, E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2 ), so E_- t / \u0127 = (gamma B (\u0127/2) t ) / \u0127 = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo, e^(-i E_- t / \u0127 ) = e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 }.\n\nSo when I wrote \u03c8(t), the exponents were correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in expressing the initial state. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of S_z in a different way.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the time evolution is under H = - gamma B S_y, the state evolves as |\u03c8(t)> = e^{-i H t / \u0127} |+z>.\n\nSo,\n\nH = - gamma B S_y.\n\nExpressing S_y in terms of Pauli matrices: S_y = (\u0127/2) (\u03c3_x - i \u03c3_y)/2? Wait, no. Wait, the Pauli matrices are defined as \u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], \u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nThe spin operator S for spin-1/2 is (\u0127/2) \u03c3.\n\nSo, S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.\n\nSo H = - gamma B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.\n\nSo,\n\nH = - (gamma B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3_y.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U = e^{-i H t / \u0127}.\n\nSubstituting H:\n\nU = e^{ i (gamma B / 2 ) \u03c3_y t }\n\nBecause:\n\nH t / \u0127 = [ - (gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) \u03c3_y ] t / \u0127 = - gamma B t/(2) \u03c3_y.\n\nSo,\n\nU = e^{ i (gamma B t/(2)) \u03c3_y }.\n\nNow, to compute U |+z>, which is the state at time t.\n\nThe state |+z> is the spin-up state along z, represented as a vector [1; 0].\n\nLet me compute U |+z>.\n\nThe matrix exponential e^{i theta \u03c3_y} can be written using the identity that for any Pauli matrix \u03c3 and angle theta,\n\ne^{i theta \u03c3} = I cos(theta) + i sigma sin(theta).\n\nSo, for sigma_y and theta = (gamma B t)/(2):\n\nU = e^{i theta sigma_y} = I cos(theta) + i sigma_y sin(theta).\n\nSo,\n\nU = [[ cos(theta) , i sin(theta) ],\n      [ -i sin(theta), cos(theta) ] ]\n\nSo, applying U to |+z> = [1; 0]:\n\nU |+z> = [ cos(theta) * 1 + i sin(theta) * 0,\n          (-i sin(theta)) * 1 + cos(theta) * 0 ]\n= [ cos(theta), -i sin(theta) ]\n\nSo, the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)> = [ cos(theta), -i sin(theta) ]^T, where theta = (gamma B t)/2.\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nS_z is (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nSo,\n\n<\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)> = (\u0127/2) [ [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ] [[1,0],[0,-1]] [ cos(theta), -i sin(theta) ] ]\n\nWait, let's compute it step by step.\n\nCompute S_z |\u03c8(t)>:\n\nS_z |\u03c8(t)> = (\u0127/2) [ [ cos(theta), 0 ],\n                     [ 0, -1 ] [ -i sin(theta) ] ]\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ]^T.\n\nThen, <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)> is the inner product of \u03c8(t) and S_z \u03c8(t):\n\n= [ cos(theta) , -i sin(theta) ] [ (\u0127/2) cos(theta), (\u0127/2) i sin(theta) ) ]\n\nWait, actually, let me compute the components:\n\nCompute each term:\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos(theta) * cos(theta) + (-i sin(theta)) * (i sin(theta)) ]\n\nBecause:\n\nFirst component: cos(theta) * (\u0127/2) cos(theta)\nSecond component: (-i sin(theta)) * (\u0127/2) (i sin(theta)) )\n\nWait, no, let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, the inner product is:\n\n[ cos(theta), -i sin(theta) ] * (\u0127/2) [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ]^T.\n\nWhich is (\u0127/2) [ cos(theta) * cos(theta) + (-i sin(theta)) * (i sin(theta)) ]\n\nCompute each part:\n\ncos(theta) * cos(theta) = cos^2(theta).\n\n(-i sin(theta)) * (i sin(theta)) = (-i)(i) sin^2(theta) = ( (-i)(i) ) sin^2(theta) = ( (-i^2) ) sin^2(theta) = ( -(-1) ) sin^2(theta) = sin^2(theta).\n\nSo the sum is cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) * 1 = \u0127/2.\n\nHmm, same result again. But according to the problem statement, the average starts oscillating, which suggests that <S_z> is varying with time. But according to my calculations, it's a constant. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the initial state. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of the magnetic moment mu_z, which is gamma times S_z.\n\nWait, the magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma S_z.\n\nSo, the average mu_z is gamma times <S_z>.\n\nIn my calculation, <S_z> is \u0127/2, so mu_z would be gamma * (\u0127/2).\n\nBut wait, that's a constant, not oscillating. So something's wrong because the problem states that the average oscillates.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the state after the field change. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the problem isn't about the expectation value of S_z, but the oscillation of the magnetic moment's z-component, which is related to the spin precession.\n\nWait, when the magnetic field changes from Z to Y, the spin starts precessing around the new field direction. The frequency of precession is determined by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. But that's for a magnetic field along a fixed axis. Wait, but in this case, the field is along Y. So perhaps the precession frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, when the field is along Y, the spin's precession would cause the expectation value of S_z to oscillate. So why in my earlier calculation did I get a constant?\n\nHmm. Let me think about another approach. Maybe using the Heisenberg picture.\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the state doesn't evolve, and the operators do. So, S_z(t) = e^{i H t/\u0127} S_z e^{-i H t/\u0127}.\n\nH is proportional to S_y. So,\n\nH = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo,\n\nS_z(t) = e^{i (gamma B S_y t / \u0127 )} S_z e^{ -i (gamma B S_y t / \u0127 ) }.\n\nWe can compute this using the commutation relations or using rotation operators.\n\nSince S_y generates rotations around the Y-axis, the operator e^{i theta S_y} would rotate the spin around Y by angle theta.\n\nThe rotation operator around Y by angle theta is R_y(theta) = e^{-i theta S_y/\u0127}.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that S_z(t) will precess around the Y-axis. The time derivative of S_z(t) can be found using the Heisenberg equation:\n\ndS_z(t)/dt = (i/\u0127) [H, S_z(t)].\n\nBut H = - gamma B S_y, so:\n\ndS_z(t)/dt = (i/\u0127)( - gamma B S_y, S_z )\n\nThe commutator [S_y, S_z] is i \u0127 S_x.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_z(t)/dt = (i/\u0127)( - gamma B (i \u0127 S_x) ) )\n= (i)( - gamma B ) (i S_x ) )\n= (i)(i) gamma B S_x\n= (-1) gamma B S_x.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_z/dt = - gamma B S_x.\n\nSimilarly, taking the time derivative again,\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = - gamma B dS_x/dt.\n\nAnd,\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/\u0127) [H, S_x] = (i/\u0127)( - gamma B S_y, S_x )\n\nThe commutator [S_y, S_x] = i \u0127 S_z.\n\nSo,\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/\u0127)( - gamma B (i \u0127 S_z ) )\n= (i)( - gamma B ) (i S_z )\n= (i)(i) gamma B S_z\n= (-1) gamma B S_z.\n\nPutting it back into the second derivative:\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = - gamma B ( - gamma B S_z )\n= (gamma B)^2 S_z.\n\nThis is a differential equation:\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = (gamma B)^2 S_z.\n\nThe solution to this is S_z(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t).\n\nBut in the Heisenberg picture, at t=0, S_z(0) = S_z. Also, the initial derivative at t=0 is dS_z/dt = - gamma B S_x(0).\n\nAt t=0, S_x(0) = S_x. So,\n\ndS_z/dt (0) = - gamma B S_x.\n\nSo, the solution should involve S_x.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write the Heisenberg equation in terms of expectation values. The expectation value of S_z(t) is <S_z(t)>.\n\nUsing the Heisenberg equation, the time derivative of <S_z(t)> is <dS_z/dt> = - gamma B <S_x>.\n\nBut we can write a system of equations for <S_x>, <S_y>, <S_z>.\n\nLet me define the expectation values as x = <S_x>, y = <S_y>, z = <S_z>.\n\nFrom the Heisenberg equations:\n\ndx/dt = (i/\u0127) < [H, S_x] > \n= (i/\u0127)( - gamma B < [S_y, S_x] > )\n= (i/\u0127)( - gamma B (i \u0127) < S_z > )\n= (i)( - gamma B i ) <S_z>\n= (gamma B ) <S_z>\n\nSimilarly,\n\ndy/dt = (i/\u0127) < [H, S_y] > \n= (i/\u0127)( - gamma B < [S_y, S_y] > )\n= 0.\n\ndz/dt = (i/\u0127) < [H, S_z] > \n= (i/\u0127)( - gamma B < [S_y, S_z] > )\n= (i/\u0127)( - gamma B (i \u0127) <S_x> )\n= (i)( - gamma B i ) <S_x>\n= (gamma B) <S_x>\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\ndx/dt = gamma B z\ndy/dt = 0\ndz/dt = gamma B x\n\nWe can write this as a system:\n\nd/dt [x; z] = gamma B [0, 1; 1, 0 ] [x; z]\n\nThis is a coupled differential equation. Let me write it as:\n\nd/dt [x; z] = gamma B ( [z; x] )\n\nWe can write this system as:\n\nd\u00b2x/dt\u00b2 = gamma B dz/dt = gamma B (gamma B x) ) = (gamma B)^2 x.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2x/dt\u00b2 = (gamma B)^2 x.\n\nThe solution is x(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t).\n\nSimilarly for z(t), but perhaps it's better to express this in terms of amplitude and phase.\n\nThe system of equations can be represented as:\n\nx(t) = C cos(gamma B t - phi)\nz(t) = C cos(gamma B t + phi)\n\nWait, but the initial conditions are important. At t=0, the initial state is |+z>, so <S_z> = \u0127/2, and <S_x> = <S_y> = 0.\n\nSo, at t=0:\n\nx(0) = 0,\nz(0) = \u0127/2.\n\nSo, for x(t):\n\nx(t) = 0 * cos(...) + something.\n\nWait, let me solve the system.\n\nWe can write the system in matrix form:\n\nd/dt [x; z] = gamma B [0 1; 1 0 ] [x; z]\n\nThe eigenvalues of the matrix [0 1; 1 0 ] are \u00b11.\n\nSo, the system has solutions involving e^{gamma B t} and e^{-gamma B t}.\n\nWait, perhaps I can diagonalize the matrix.\n\nThe matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which has eigenvalues 1 and -1.\n\nThe eigenvectors are [1,1] and [1,-1].\n\nSo, the solution can be written as:\n\n[x; z] = A e^{gamma B t} [1;1] + B e^{-gamma B t} [1;-1]\n\nApplying initial conditions:\n\nAt t=0, x=0, z= \u0127/2.\n\nSo,\n\n[0; \u0127/2] = A [1;1] + B [1;-1]\n\nWhich gives:\n\n0 = A + B,\n\u0127/2 = A - B.\n\nFrom the first equation, B = -A.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\n\u0127/2 = A - (-A) = 2A \u2192 A = \u0127/4.\n\nSo,\n\n[x; z] = (\u0127/4) e^{gamma B t} [1;1] - (\u0127/4) e^{-gamma B t} [1;-1]\n\nSo,\n\nx(t) = (\u0127/4) ( e^{gamma B t} - e^{-gamma B t} ) ) = (\u0127/4) ( 2 sinh(gamma B t) ) ) = (\u0127/2) sinh(gamma B t).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the sinh function grows without bound, which isn't physical. So perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.\n\nWait, let me re-express the solution:\n\n[x; z] = A e^{gamma B t} [1;1] + B e^{-gamma B t} [1;-1].\n\nAt t=0:\n\n0 = A + B,\n\u0127/2 = A - B.\n\nSo,\n\nFrom 0 = A + B \u2192 B = -A.\n\nSubstituting into \u0127/2 = A - B \u2192 \u0127/2 = A - (-A) \u2192 \u0127/2 = 2A \u2192 A = \u0127/4.\n\nSo,\n\nx(t) = (\u0127/4) e^{gamma B t} (1) + (-\u0127/4) e^{-gamma B t} (1) \n= (\u0127/4) [ e^{gamma B t} - e^{-gamma B t} ] \n= (\u0127/2) sinh(gamma B t).\n\nSimilarly,\n\nz(t) = (\u0127/4) e^{gamma B t} (1) + (-\u0127/4) e^{-gamma B t} (-1) \n= (\u0127/4) e^{gamma B t} + (\u0127/4) e^{-gamma B t}\n= (\u0127/2) cosh(gamma B t).\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because when t increases, x grows exponentially, which doesn't make sense for expectation values of spin components, which are bounded.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me check the system again.\n\nThe equations were:\n\ndx/dt = gamma B z,\ndz/dt = gamma B x.\n\nAt t=0, x=0, z= \u0127/2.\n\nLet me try solving them as differential equations.\n\nLet me write dz/dt = gamma B x.\n\nBut from dx/dt = gamma B z,\n\nSo, substituting x from dx/dt into dz/dt:\n\ndz/dt = gamma B x = gamma B (dx/dt / (gamma B z )) ) \u2192 dz/dt = dx/dt / z.\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, write this as d\u00b2z/dt\u00b2 = gamma B dx/dt = gamma B (gamma B z ) \u2192 d\u00b2z/dt\u00b2 = (gamma B)^2 z.\n\nSo,\n\nz(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t).\n\nAt t=0,\n\nz(0) = \u0127/2 \u2192 A = \u0127/2.\n\ndz/dt(0) = gamma B x(0) = 0 \u2192 B * gamma B * (0) = 0 \u2192 B can be any value? Wait, no, because dz/dt(0) = 0.\n\nWait, let me compute dz/dt(0):\n\ndz/dt(0) = gamma B x(0) = gamma B * 0 = 0.\n\nSo,\n\nz(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t).\n\nAnd from dz/dt = gamma B x \u2192 x = dz/dt / gamma B.\n\nSo,\n\nx(t) = [ - (gamma B) (\u0127/2) sin(gamma B t) + B gamma B cos(gamma B t) ] / gamma B\n= - (\u0127/2) sin(gamma B t) + B cos(gamma B t).\n\nBut at t=0, x(0)=0 \u2192 0 = -0 + B cos(0) \u2192 B = 0.\n\nSo,\n\nz(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t),\nx(t) = - (\u0127/2) sin(gamma B t).\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nAh, there it is! So the expectation value of S_z oscillates with angular frequency gamma B. So the average of mu_z, which is gamma <S_z>, would be gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the average of the z-component of the particle's moment (mu_z) oscillates. So mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma < S_z > = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos(gamma B t ).\n\nThe oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, looking back at the Heisenberg solution, the frequency is gamma B. But earlier, when I computed the state in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, I got a constant expectation value. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial state expansion. Let me think: in the Schr\u00f6dinger approach, I found <S_z> = \u0127/2, which is a constant, but according to the Heisenberg approach, it oscillates as (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t). So there must be a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Schr\u00f6dinger approach's calculation. Let me re-express the state and recompute <S_z>.\n\nIn the Schr\u00f6dinger approach, the state at time t is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ cos(theta), -i sin(theta) ]^T, where theta = (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = [ cos(theta), i sin(theta) ] ( (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] ) [ cos(theta), -i sin(theta) ]^T.\n\nCompute this:\n\nFirst component: cos(theta) * (\u0127/2) * 1 * cos(theta) \u2192 (\u0127/2) cos^2(theta)\nSecond component: (i sin(theta)) * (\u0127/2) * (-1) * (-i sin(theta)) \u2192 (i sin(theta)) (\u0127/2) (i sin(theta)) ) \u2192 (i^2) (\u0127/2) sin^2(theta) \u2192 (-1) (\u0127/2) sin^2(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = (\u0127/2) cos^2(theta) - (\u0127/2) sin^2(theta)\n= (\u0127/2) (cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta))\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta).\n\nBecause cos(2 theta) = cos\u00b2(theta) - sin\u00b2(theta).\n\nAh! So I made a mistake earlier. The correct expectation value is (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta), where theta is (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = (\u0127/2) cos( 2 * (gamma B t / 2 ) ) ) = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nWhich matches the Heisenberg result.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which corresponds to option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched to point along the $+y$ direction, and the task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis\n\n1. **Initial Setup and Hamiltonian**:  \n   Initially, the magnetic field is along $+z$, and the particle is in an eigenstate of $S_z$. When the field is switched to $+y$, the Hamiltonian changes to $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\\pm \\hbar/2$. The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, leading to time-dependent evolution.\n\n2. **Time Evolution and Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  \n   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$. After time $t$, the state evolves as:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{i\\gamma B t/2} |+y\\rangle + e^{-i\\gamma B t/2} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   The expectation value of $S_z$ is then computed as:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle.\n   \\]\n   Using the relations between $|+z\\rangle$, $|-z\\rangle$, $|+y\\rangle$, and $|-y\\rangle$, the calculation shows that:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Oscillation of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$**:  \n   The magnetic moment $\\mu_z$ is related to $S_z$ by $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$. Therefore, the average $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ oscillates as:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   The oscillation frequency is determined by the angular frequency $\\gamma B$.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  \n   - **Option A ($\\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The frequency is not halved; the oscillation frequency matches $\\gamma B$.  \n   - **Option B ($\\gamma B$)**: Correct. The oscillation frequency is $\\gamma B$, as derived from the time-dependent expectation value of $S_z$.  \n   - **Option C ($\\sqrt{2} \\gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ in the frequency.  \n   - **Option D ($\\gamma B / \\sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The frequency is not reduced by $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$.  \n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Let's see what it's asking. Hmm.\n\nThe setup is that the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz, and it's aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle\u2019s moment.\n\nWait, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin states align with the field. But here, the field is changing direction suddenly, so the system will no longer be in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time, causing oscillations in expectation values.\n\nOriginally, when the field was along +Z, the magnetic moment is along Z. The spin is in an eigenstate of Sz. When the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B, but wait, the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z. So the original energy was proportional to S_z, but now the magnetic field is along Y, so the energy is proportional to S_y.\n\nWait, let me think. The magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * S_z. So the energy in a magnetic field B is U = - mu \u00b7 B. When the field is along Z, it's U = -gamma S_z B. But when the field switches to Y, it's U = -gamma (S \u00b7 Y) B, but wait, S \u00b7 Y would be S_y multiplied by some direction.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, I think I might have a confusion here. Oh wait, no. The magnetic moment for a spin-1/2 particle is usually given by mu = gamma S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and S is the spin operator. But in this question, it's given as mu = gamma S_z. So that's different. So the magnetic moment is along the z-direction only? Or is mu a vector with components depending on the spin direction?\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify. The magnetic moment vector mu is typically proportional to the spin vector S. So mu = gamma * S, where S is a vector operator with components Sx, Sy, Sz. So in the problem statement, mu is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. Hmm, that seems a bit odd. Wait, maybe it's a typo in the problem, but let's go with what's given.\n\nSo mu = gamma S_z. So the magnetic moment is along the z-direction regardless of the spin state. But that doesn't make much sense because the spin can precess around the magnetic field. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial state is with the magnetic field along +Z. So the spin is aligned along Z. So the initial state is either spin-up or spin-down along Z. Then, the magnetic field is switched off and turned on along Y. So the new magnetic field is along Y, same magnitude B.\n\nWait, but the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. So when the field is along Y, the interaction energy is U = -mu \u00b7 B. So substituting, U = -gamma S_z B_Y. But since B is along Y, B_Y = B, and B_x and B_z are zero. So U = -gamma B S_z.\n\nWait, but wait. If the magnetic field is along Y, the direction of the field is in Y. So the energy should be proportional to the component of the magnetic moment in the Y direction. Oh, but in this case, the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S_z, which is along Z. So the dot product mu \u00b7 B would be (gamma S_z) * B_Y, because B is along Y. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me get this right. The magnetic moment vector is mu = gamma S_z, which is a vector along the z-axis. The magnetic field is along Y, so its vector is B = B * \u0177. So the dot product is mu \u00b7 B = gamma S_z * B * (\u1e91 \u00b7 \u0177) = 0, because \u1e91 and \u0177 are perpendicular. So the interaction energy U would be zero?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if the magnetic field is along Y, and the magnetic moment is along Z, then the dot product would be zero, so no energy. But that would mean the Hamiltonian is zero, which can't be correct. That would imply that the spin state doesn't change over time, which can't be the case because the question says the average z-component starts oscillating.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial understanding. Let me reread the question.\n\nThe problem says: mu = gamma * S_z. Oh wait, perhaps mu is the z-component of the magnetic moment. No, that's not how it's written. The question states mu is equal to gamma times S_z. So mu is a vector whose only component is in the z-direction, proportional to S_z. That seems odd because the magnetic moment would then only have a z-component, regardless of the spin orientation. But that would mean that when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction energy is zero, which would imply no oscillations. But the question says the average z-component oscillates, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S, the vector. So mu_x = gamma Sx, mu_y = gamma Sy, mu_z = gamma Sz. Then, when the field is along Y, the energy would be U = - mu \u00b7 B = -gamma (S \u00b7 Y) B. So S \u00b7 Y would be Sy, so U = -gamma B Sy.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. Maybe the problem statement has a typo, or perhaps I misread it. Alternatively, perhaps mu is the vector, but the way it's written is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says mu = gamma * Sz. So mu is a vector where only the z-component is non-zero, equal to gamma Sz. So the magnetic moment is along the z-axis. But when the magnetic field is along Y, the energy would be U = - mu \u00b7 B = - (gamma Sz) * B_Y. Since B is along Y, B_Y = B, and B_z = 0. So U = -gamma B Sz * (0) because mu is along Z, B along Y: their dot product is zero. So U = 0. That can't be right because then the Hamiltonian would be zero, and the state wouldn't change, so no oscillations.\n\nBut the question says that the average z-component oscillates, so I must be misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps mu is the magnitude of the magnetic moment, which would be gamma times the magnitude of S. But that wouldn't make sense either because S is a vector operator, and its magnitude isn't simply along any axis.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that mu is the vector, so mu = gamma S. So mu has components in x, y, and z. That would make more sense because then the interaction with the magnetic field along Y would involve Sy.\n\nWait, let me proceed under that assumption because otherwise the problem doesn't make sense. So I think the problem statement probably intended that mu is gamma multiplied by the vector S. So mu = gamma S, with S being the spin operator vector.\n\nSo the initial setup: magnetic field along Z. So the Hamiltonian is H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B_initial. Which is H_initial = -gamma S_z B. So the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies proportional to +gamma B and -gamma B.\n\nWhen the field is switched off and turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = - mu \u00b7 B_final = -gamma S_y B. So the eigenstates of this new Hamiltonian are |+y> and |-y>, with energies proportional to +gamma B and -gamma B.\n\nThe initial state was an eigenstate of H_initial, which is either |+z> or |-z>. When the field changes, the state is no longer an eigenstate of H_final. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the magnetic moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> because mu = gamma S.\n\nSo we need to find the time dependence of <S_z> in the new Hamiltonian.\n\nTo find this, let's model the time evolution after the field is switched. The initial state is |psi(0)> = |+z> or |-z>, but let's say it's |+z> for simplicity.\n\nWait, but the initial state is aligned with the original field along Z. So it's an eigenstate of Sz. So, for example, |+z> has S_z = \u0127/2 (but since we're using units where \u0127=1 for spin-1/2, S_z is +1/2).\n\nWhen the field is turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Let's set gamma B as a single term for simplicity; let me denote it as \u03c9_0. So H = -omega_0 S_y.\n\nWait, no, let's be precise. The Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B. Since mu = gamma S, and B is along Y with magnitude B, so H = -gamma B S_y. Let me write this as H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |psi(0)>. But since \u0127 is 1 in these units, it's exp(-i H t).\n\nThe expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nNow, the initial state |psi(0)> is |+z>, which is (1,0) in the Sz basis. Let me express this in the eigenbasis of H, which is the S_y basis.\n\nThe eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, which can be written in terms of |+z> and |-z> as:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nBecause S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, which for spin-1/2 are \u00b11/2 when \u0127=1.\n\nThe initial state |+z> can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the initial state is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe time evolution under H is given by each eigenstate picking up a phase. Since H |+y> = (+ gamma B S_y) |+y> = (+ gamma B (1/2)) |+y> = (gamma B / 2) |+y>. Wait, wait, H is -gamma B S_y. So H |+y> = - gamma B (1/2) |+y>.\n\nWait, S_y |+y> = (1/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = (-gamma B) (1/2) |+y> = - (gamma B/2) |+y>.\n\nSimilarly, H |-y> = (-gamma B) (-1/2) |-y> = (gamma B/2) |-y>.\n\nSo the time evolution of each component is:\n\n|+y> \u2192 exp( -i H t ) |+y> = exp( i (gamma B/2) t ) |+y>\nSimilarly, |-y> \u2192 exp( -i H t ) |-y> = exp( -i (gamma B/2) t ) |-y>\n\nWait, no. Let me be precise. The time evolution operator is U = exp(-i H t). So for each eigenstate |n> with eigenvalue E_n, U |n> = exp( -i E_n t ) |n>.\n\nH |+y> = E_+ |+y>, where E_+ = -gamma B (1/2) * (1/2? Wait, no. Wait, S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, which for \u0127=1 are \u00b1 1/2. So S_y |+y> = (1/2) |+y>.\n\nSo H = -gamma B S_y \u2192 H |+y> = (-gamma B)(1/2) |+y> = (-gamma B/2) |+y> \u2192 E_+ = -gamma B/2.\n\nSimilarly, H |-y> = (-gamma B) (-1/2) |-y> = (gamma B/2) |-y> \u2192 E_- = gamma B/2.\n\nSo the time evolution for each component is:\n\n|+y> \u2192 exp( -i (-gamma B/2) t ) |+y> = exp( i (gamma B/2) t ) |+y>\n|-y> \u2192 exp( -i (gamma B/2) t ) |-y>\n\nSo the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nAfter time t, it becomes:\n\n( exp( i (gamma B/2) t ) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B/2) t ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we can write this as:\n\n[ e^{i \u03c9 t} |+y> + e^{-i \u03c9 t} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nWhere \u03c9 = gamma B / 2.\n\nNow, we can express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting back into |psi(t)>:\n\n[ e^{i \u03c9 t} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i \u03c9 t} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nFactor out 1/sqrt(2):\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i \u03c9 t} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{-i \u03c9 t} (|+z> - |-z>) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSo combining terms:\n\n1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) ) [ (e^{i \u03c9 t} + e^{-i \u03c9 t}) |+z> + (e^{i \u03c9 t} - e^{-i \u03c9 t}) |-z> ]\n\nWhich is 1/2 [ 2 cos(\u03c9 t) |+z> + 2i sin(\u03c9 t) |-z> ]\n\nSo |psi(t)> = cos(\u03c9 t) |+z> + i sin(\u03c9 t) |-z>\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nS_z |+z> = (1/2) |+z>\nS_z |-z> = (-1/2) |-z>\n\nCompute <S_z>:\n\n= [ cos(\u03c9 t) < +z | + i sin(\u03c9 t) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(\u03c9 t) |+z> + i sin(\u03c9 t) |-z> ]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= cos^2(\u03c9 t) < +z | S_z | +z > + i cos(\u03c9 t) sin(\u03c9 t) < +z | S_z |-z> \n+ i sin(\u03c9 t) cos(\u03c9 t) < -z | S_z |+z> \n+ i^2 sin^2(\u03c9 t) < -z | S_z |-z>\n\nSince < +z | S_z | +z > = 1/2, and < -z | S_z |-z> = -1/2. The cross terms are zero because < +z | S_z |-z> = 0.\n\nSo:\n\n= cos^2(\u03c9 t) * (1/2) + (-1) sin^2(\u03c9 t) * (1/2)\n\nBecause i^2 = -1.\n\nSo:\n\n= (1/2) [ cos^2(\u03c9 t) - sin^2(\u03c9 t) ]\n\nWhich is (1/2) cos(2 \u03c9 t )\n\nSo the expectation value of S_z oscillates as cos(2 \u03c9 t ), where \u03c9 is gamma B / 2.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is 2 \u03c9 = 2*(gamma B/2) ) = gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. The average of S_z is (1/2) cos(2 \u03c9 t ), so the oscillation has a frequency of 2\u03c9. Since \u03c9 is gamma B/2, 2\u03c9 is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle\u2019s moment. Since mu_z = gamma S_z, the average mu_z is gamma <S_z>, which would be (gamma/2) cos(2 \u03c9 t ). So the oscillation frequency is 2 \u03c9, which is gamma B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The frequency in the cosine is 2\u03c9, so the period is 2\u03c0/(2\u03c9) = \u03c0/(\u03c9). So the frequency is 2\u03c9, which would be gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B. So the answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the time evolution. Another approach is to compute the time derivative of the energy or use the time evolution operator.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the energy levels. The energy difference between |+y> and |-y> is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B/2) - (-gamma B/2) ) = gamma B. So the transition frequency between these states is (E_- - E_+)/hbar, which is gamma B.\n\nIn terms of oscillations in expectation values, the frequency would be related to the energy difference. So the oscillation frequency should be gamma B, which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. The expectation value of S_z oscillates with frequency 2\u03c9, where \u03c9 is gamma B/2. So 2\u03c9 is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Let's see what it's asking. Hmm.\n\nThe setup is that the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz, and it's aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle\u2019s moment.\n\nWait, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin states align with the field. But here, the field is changing direction suddenly, so the system will no longer be in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time, causing oscillations in expectation values.\n\nOriginally, when the field was along +Z, the magnetic moment is along Z. The spin is in an eigenstate of Sz. When the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B, but wait, the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z. So the original energy was proportional to S_z, but now the magnetic field is along Y, so the energy is proportional to S_y.\n\nWait, let me think. The magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * S_z. So the energy in a magnetic field B is U = - mu \u00b7 B. When the field is along Z, it's U = -gamma S_z B. But when the field switches to Y, it's U = -gamma (S \u00b7 Y) B, but wait, S \u00b7 Y would be S_y multiplied by some direction.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, I think I might have a confusion here. Oh wait, no. The magnetic moment for a spin-1/2 particle is usually given by mu = gamma S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and S is the spin operator. But in this question, it's given as mu = gamma S_z. So that's different. So the magnetic moment is along the z-direction only? Or is mu a vector with components depending on the spin direction?\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify. The magnetic moment vector mu is typically proportional to the spin vector S. So mu = gamma * S, where S is a vector operator with components Sx, Sy, Sz. So in the problem statement, mu is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. Hmm, that seems a bit odd. Wait, maybe it's a typo in the problem, but let's go with what's given.\n\nSo mu = gamma S_z. So the magnetic moment is along the z-direction regardless of the spin state. But that doesn't make much sense because the spin can precess around the magnetic field. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial state is with the magnetic field along +Z. So the spin is aligned along Z. So the initial state is either spin-up or spin-down along Z. Then, the magnetic field is switched off and turned on along Y. So the new magnetic field is along Y, same magnitude B.\n\nWait, but the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. So when the field is along Y, the interaction energy is U = -mu \u00b7 B. So substituting, U = -gamma S_z B_Y. But since B is along Y, B_Y = B, and B_x and B_z are zero. So U = -gamma B S_z.\n\nWait, but wait. If the magnetic field is along Y, the direction of the field is in Y. So the energy should be proportional to the component of the magnetic moment in the Y direction. Oh, but in this case, the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S_z, which is along Z. So the dot product mu \u00b7 B would be (gamma S_z) * B_Y, because B is along Y. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me get this right. The magnetic moment vector is mu = gamma S_z, which is a vector along the z-axis. The magnetic field is along Y, so its vector is B = B * \u0177. So the dot product is mu \u00b7 B = gamma S_z * B * (\u1e91 \u00b7 \u0177) = 0, because \u1e91 and \u0177 are perpendicular. So the interaction energy U would be zero?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if the magnetic field is along Y, and the magnetic moment is along Z, then the dot product would be zero, so no energy. But that would mean the Hamiltonian is zero, which can't be correct. That would imply that the spin state doesn't change over time, which can't be the case because the question says the average z-component starts oscillating.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial understanding. Let me reread the question.\n\nThe problem says: mu = gamma * S_z. Oh wait, perhaps mu is the z-component of the magnetic moment. No, that's not how it's written. The question states mu is equal to gamma times S_z. So mu is a vector whose only component is in the z-direction, proportional to S_z. That seems odd because the magnetic moment would then only have a z-component, regardless of the spin orientation. But that would mean that when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction energy is zero, which would imply no oscillations. But the question says the average z-component oscillates, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S, the vector. So mu_x = gamma Sx, mu_y = gamma Sy, mu_z = gamma Sz. Then, when the field is along Y, the energy would be U = - mu \u00b7 B = -gamma (S \u00b7 Y) B. So S \u00b7 Y would be Sy, so U = -gamma B Sy.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. Maybe the problem statement has a typo, or perhaps I misread it. Alternatively, perhaps mu is the vector, but the way it's written is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says mu = gamma * Sz. So mu is a vector where only the z-component is non-zero, equal to gamma Sz. So the magnetic moment is along the z-axis. But when the magnetic field is along Y, the energy would be U = - mu \u00b7 B = - (gamma Sz) * B_Y. Since B is along Y, B_Y = B, and B_z = 0. So U = -gamma B Sz * (0) because mu is along Z, B along Y: their dot product is zero. So U = 0. That can't be right because then the Hamiltonian would be zero, and the state wouldn't change, so no oscillations.\n\nBut the question says that the average z-component oscillates, so I must be misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps mu is the magnitude of the magnetic moment, which would be gamma times the magnitude of S. But that wouldn't make sense either because S is a vector operator, and its magnitude isn't simply along any axis.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that mu is the vector, so mu = gamma S. So mu has components in x, y, and z. That would make more sense because then the interaction with the magnetic field along Y would involve Sy.\n\nWait, let me proceed under that assumption because otherwise the problem doesn't make sense. So I think the problem statement probably intended that mu is gamma multiplied by the vector S. So mu = gamma S, with S being the spin operator vector.\n\nSo the initial setup: magnetic field along Z. So the Hamiltonian is H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B_initial. Which is H_initial = -gamma S_z B. So the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies proportional to +gamma B and -gamma B.\n\nWhen the field is switched off and turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = - mu \u00b7 B_final = -gamma S_y B. So the eigenstates of this new Hamiltonian are |+y> and |-y>, with energies proportional to +gamma B and -gamma B.\n\nThe initial state was an eigenstate of H_initial, which is either |+z> or |-z>. When the field changes, the state is no longer an eigenstate of H_final. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the magnetic moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> because mu = gamma S.\n\nSo we need to find the time dependence of <S_z> in the new Hamiltonian.\n\nTo find this, let's model the time evolution after the field is switched. The initial state is |psi(0)> = |+z> or |-z>, but let's say it's |+z> for simplicity.\n\nWait, but the initial state is aligned with the original field along Z. So it's an eigenstate of Sz. So, for example, |+z> has S_z = \u0127/2 (but since we're using units where \u0127=1 for spin-1/2, S_z is +1/2).\n\nWhen the field is turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Let's set gamma B as a single term for simplicity; let me denote it as \u03c9_0. So H = -omega_0 S_y.\n\nWait, no, let's be precise. The Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B. Since mu = gamma S, and B is along Y with magnitude B, so H = -gamma B S_y. Let me write this as H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |psi(0)>. But since \u0127 is 1 in these units, it's exp(-i H t).\n\nThe expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nNow, the initial state |psi(0)> is |+z>, which is (1,0) in the Sz basis. Let me express this in the eigenbasis of H, which is the S_y basis.\n\nThe eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, which can be written in terms of |+z> and |-z> as:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nBecause S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, which for spin-1/2 are \u00b11/2 when \u0127=1.\n\nThe initial state |+z> can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the initial state is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe time evolution under H is given by each eigenstate picking up a phase. Since H |+y> = (+ gamma B S_y) |+y> = (+ gamma B (1/2)) |+y> = (gamma B / 2) |+y>. Wait, wait, H is -gamma B S_y. So H |+y> = - gamma B (1/2) |+y>.\n\nWait, S_y |+y> = (1/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = (-gamma B) (1/2) |+y> = - (gamma B/2) |+y>.\n\nSimilarly, H |-y> = (-gamma B) (-1/2) |-y> = (gamma B/2) |-y>.\n\nSo the time evolution of each component is:\n\n|+y> \u2192 exp( -i H t ) |+y> = exp( i (gamma B/2) t ) |+y>\nSimilarly, |-y> \u2192 exp( -i H t ) |-y> = exp( -i (gamma B/2) t ) |-y>\n\nWait, no. Let me be precise. The time evolution operator is U = exp(-i H t). So for each eigenstate |n> with eigenvalue E_n, U |n> = exp( -i E_n t ) |n>.\n\nH |+y> = E_+ |+y>, where E_+ = -gamma B (1/2) * (1/2? Wait, no. Wait, S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, which for \u0127=1 are \u00b1 1/2. So S_y |+y> = (1/2) |+y>.\n\nSo H = -gamma B S_y \u2192 H |+y> = (-gamma B)(1/2) |+y> = (-gamma B/2) |+y> \u2192 E_+ = -gamma B/2.\n\nSimilarly, H |-y> = (-gamma B) (-1/2) |-y> = (gamma B/2) |-y> \u2192 E_- = gamma B/2.\n\nSo the time evolution for each component is:\n\n|+y> \u2192 exp( -i (-gamma B/2) t ) |+y> = exp( i (gamma B/2) t ) |+y>\n|-y> \u2192 exp( -i (gamma B/2) t ) |-y>\n\nSo the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nAfter time t, it becomes:\n\n( exp( i (gamma B/2) t ) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B/2) t ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we can write this as:\n\n[ e^{i \u03c9 t} |+y> + e^{-i \u03c9 t} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nWhere \u03c9 = gamma B / 2.\n\nNow, we can express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting back into |psi(t)>:\n\n[ e^{i \u03c9 t} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i \u03c9 t} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nFactor out 1/sqrt(2):\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i \u03c9 t} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{-i \u03c9 t} (|+z> - |-z>) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSo combining terms:\n\n1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) ) [ (e^{i \u03c9 t} + e^{-i \u03c9 t}) |+z> + (e^{i \u03c9 t} - e^{-i \u03c9 t}) |-z> ]\n\nWhich is 1/2 [ 2 cos(\u03c9 t) |+z> + 2i sin(\u03c9 t) |-z> ]\n\nSo |psi(t)> = cos(\u03c9 t) |+z> + i sin(\u03c9 t) |-z>\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nS_z |+z> = (1/2) |+z>\nS_z |-z> = (-1/2) |-z>\n\nCompute <S_z>:\n\n= [ cos(\u03c9 t) < +z | + i sin(\u03c9 t) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(\u03c9 t) |+z> + i sin(\u03c9 t) |-z> ]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= cos^2(\u03c9 t) < +z | S_z | +z > + i cos(\u03c9 t) sin(\u03c9 t) < +z | S_z |-z> \n+ i sin(\u03c9 t) cos(\u03c9 t) < -z | S_z |+z> \n+ i^2 sin^2(\u03c9 t) < -z | S_z |-z>\n\nSince < +z | S_z | +z > = 1/2, and < -z | S_z |-z> = -1/2. The cross terms are zero because < +z | S_z |-z> = 0.\n\nSo:\n\n= cos^2(\u03c9 t) * (1/2) + (-1) sin^2(\u03c9 t) * (1/2)\n\nBecause i^2 = -1.\n\nSo:\n\n= (1/2) [ cos^2(\u03c9 t) - sin^2(\u03c9 t) ]\n\nWhich is (1/2) cos(2 \u03c9 t )\n\nSo the expectation value of S_z oscillates as cos(2 \u03c9 t ), where \u03c9 is gamma B / 2.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is 2 \u03c9 = 2*(gamma B/2) ) = gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. The average of S_z is (1/2) cos(2 \u03c9 t ), so the oscillation has a frequency of 2\u03c9. Since \u03c9 is gamma B/2, 2\u03c9 is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle\u2019s moment. Since mu_z = gamma S_z, the average mu_z is gamma <S_z>, which would be (gamma/2) cos(2 \u03c9 t ). So the oscillation frequency is 2 \u03c9, which is gamma B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The frequency in the cosine is 2\u03c9, so the period is 2\u03c0/(2\u03c9) = \u03c0/(\u03c9). So the frequency is 2\u03c9, which would be gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B. So the answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the time evolution. Another approach is to compute the time derivative of the energy or use the time evolution operator.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the energy levels. The energy difference between |+y> and |-y> is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B/2) - (-gamma B/2) ) = gamma B. So the transition frequency between these states is (E_- - E_+)/hbar, which is gamma B.\n\nIn terms of oscillations in expectation values, the frequency would be related to the energy difference. So the oscillation frequency should be gamma B, which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. The expectation value of S_z oscillates with frequency 2\u03c9, where \u03c9 is gamma B/2. So 2\u03c9 is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S$, where $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio and $S$ is the spin operator. Initially, the magnetic field is along the $+z$ direction, and the particle is in an eigenstate of $S_z$. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched off and turned on along the $+y$ direction, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian $H = -\\mu \\cdot B = -\\gamma B S_y$. This causes the state to evolve over time, leading to oscillations in the expectation value of the $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State and Basis Transformation**:  \n   The initial state is $|+z\\rangle$, an eigenstate of $S_z$. The new Hamiltonian $H = -\\gamma B S_y$ has eigenstates $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, which are superpositions of $|+z\\rangle$ and $|-z\\rangle$:\n   \\[\n   |+y\\rangle = \\frac{|+z\\rangle + |-z\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\quad |-y\\rangle = \\frac{|+z\\rangle - |-z\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n   \\]\n   The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ can thus be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{|+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Time Evolution**:  \n   Under the new Hamiltonian, the eigenstates $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$ acquire time-dependent phases:\n   \\[\n   |+y\\rangle \\to e^{i\\omega t}|+y\\rangle, \\quad |-y\\rangle \\to e^{-i\\omega t}|-y\\rangle,\n   \\]\n   where $\\omega = \\frac{\\gamma B}{2}$. Substituting these into the time-evolved state:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos(\\omega t)|+z\\rangle + i\\sin(\\omega t)|-z\\rangle.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  \n   The expectation value of $S_z$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t)| S_z |\\psi(t)\\rangle.\n   \\]\n   Expanding this using the time-evolved state and the eigenvalues of $S_z$ ($\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$ for $|+z\\rangle$ and $|-z\\rangle$), we find:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\cos(2\\omega t).\n   \\]\n   The oscillation frequency of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ is therefore $2\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n4. **Oscillation Frequency of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$**:  \n   Since $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$, the oscillation frequency of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ is the same as that of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$, which is $\\gamma B$.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe oscillation frequency of the $z$-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$. This corresponds to **option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.\n\nAlright, the setup: there's a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu. Oh wait, mu is given as gamma times S_z. Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think. The initial magnetic field is along +Z, so the magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then suddenly, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. Its spin is aligned, so its magnetic moment is along Z. Then the field switches to Y. I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the spin will precess around the new field direction. But how does that affect the expectation value of the z-component?\n\nHmm, spin-1/2 particles have their spin in a particular state. The initial state is probably an eigenstate of S_z because the magnetic field is along Z. So the state is |+z> or something like that.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly changed to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The original Hamiltonian was proportional to S_z, and now it's proportional to S_y. The time evolution will be governed by the new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe oscillation frequency probably comes from the energy difference between the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. Let me think about the energy levels.\n\nThe magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. So H = -gamma B (S \u00b7 n), where n is the direction of B. Initially, n was along z, now along y.\n\nSo when B is along y, H is proportional to S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +hbar/2 and -hbar/2. Wait, but spin matrices... S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. But the Hamiltonian would be H = -gamma B S_y. So the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2), because S_y |\u00b1y> = \u00b1 \u0127/2 |\u00b1y>.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check. The Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B. Oh, wait, mu is gamma S. So H = -gamma B (S \u00b7 n). So if B is along y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of H are E = -gamma B (s), where s is the eigenvalue of S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2) * (-1)? Wait, no. Let me compute.\n\nH = -gamma B S_y.\n\nS_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nSo H|+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y> \u2192 E_+ = -gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nSimilarly, S_y |-y> = (-\u0127/2)|-y>.\n\nH| -y> = -gamma B (-\u0127/2)|-y> \u2192 E_- = gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nWait, so the energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = +gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nThe time evolution of a state is determined by these energy levels. The initial state is |+z>, since the particle was in a magnetic field along Z. So after the field changes to Y, the state is still |+z>, but the Hamiltonian is now H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nThe state |+z> can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>. Let me think about that. The states |+y> and |-y> are linear combinations of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nThe standard expressions are:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo when the Hamiltonian changes to H, the state will evolve as a combination of the energy eigenstates |+y> and |-y>.\n\nEach component will pick up a phase factor. The time evolution for each eigenstate is e^{-i E t / \u0127}.\n\nSo for |+y>, E = -gamma B \u0127/2. The phase factor is e^{-i (-gamma B \u0127/2) t / \u0127} = e^{i gamma B t / 2}.\n\nFor |-y>, E = gamma B \u0127/2. The phase factor is e^{-i (gamma B \u0127/2) t / \u0127} = e^{-i gamma B t / 2}.\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n\u03c8(t) = (|+y> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |-y> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but the initial state was |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). So after time t, each term evolves with their respective phases.\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nLet me compute that. S_z is the operator, and the states involved are |+y> and |-y>.\n\nWait, let me write \u03c8(t) as [e^{i a t} |+y> + e^{-i a t} |-y> ] / sqrt(2), where a = gamma B /2.\n\nSo \u03c8(t) = ( e^{i a t} |+y> + e^{-i a t} |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nThen, S_z \u03c8(t) = S_z [ ... ].\n\nBut S_z |+y> and S_z |-y> can be computed. Let me remember that S_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2). Wait no, wait. Let me think about matrix representations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> directly.\n\nCompute <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nLet me write \u03c8(t) as (|+y> e^{i a t} + |-y> e^{-i a t}) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 is ( <+y| e^{-i a t} + < -y| e^{i a t} ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 S_z \u03c8 = [ ( <+y| e^{-i a t} + < -y| e^{i a t} ) / sqrt(2) ) ] S_z [ ( |+y> e^{i a t} + |-y> e^{-i a t} ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n\nMultiplying this out:\n\n= [ ( <+y| e^{-i a t} + < -y| e^{i a t} ) ( |+y> e^{i a t} + |-y> e^{-i a t} ) ) ] / 2.\n\nExpanding:\n\n= [ <+y|+y> e^{-i a t} e^{i a t} + <+y| -y> e^{-i a t} e^{-i a t} + < -y| +y> e^{i a t} e^{i a t} + < -y| -y> e^{i a t} e^{-i a t} ] / 2.\n\nBut <+y| -y> and < -y| +y> are zero because they're orthogonal.\n\nSo only the first and last terms remain:\n\n= [ <+y|+y> e^{0} + < -y| -y> e^{0} ] / 2.\n\nSince <+y|+y> = 1, < -y| -y> =1.\n\nSo this is (1 + 1)/2 = 1. But wait, that's just the scalar, but S_z is acting on the state. Did I make a mistake in the expansion? Hmm, perhaps I should compute this more carefully.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of expectation values. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express S_z in the |+y> and |-y> basis.\n\nIn the |+y> and |-y> basis, S_z can be written as a matrix. Let me compute the matrix elements.\n\nWe know that |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nS_z |+z> = (\u0127/2)|+z>, S_z |-z> = (-\u0127/2)|-z>.\n\nSo S_z |+y> = (S_z |+z> + S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= \u0127/2 [ |+z> - |-z> ] / sqrt(2)\n= \u0127/2 ( (|+y> - |-y> ) / sqrt(2) ) * 2? Wait, no.\n\nWait, let me compute S_z |+y>.\n\nWe have S_z |+y> = S_z (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) \n= (S_z |+z> + S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2)( |+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) ( (|+y> + |-y> ) + (|+y> - |-y> ) ) ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) )?\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Maybe a better way is to find the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y> and |-y> basis.\n\nThe states are |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe matrix elements would be:\n\n<S_z>_{+y, +y} = < +y | S_z | +y >.\n\nSimilarly for other elements.\n\nCompute < +y | S_z | +y >.\n\nUsing the expressions:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\nSo S_z |+y> = ( S_z |+z> + S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ( |+z> - |-z> )\nBut |+z> - |-z> = sqrt(2) | -y >.\n\nBecause |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2),\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo |+z> - |-z> = sqrt(2) |-y> \u2192 S_z |+y> = \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * sqrt(2) | -y > = \u0127/2 | -y >.\n\nWait, but that's the action of S_z on |+y>. So the matrix element < +y | S_z | +y > is zero because S_z |+y> is | -y > times \u0127/2, and < +y | -y > is zero.\n\nWait, no, the matrix elements would be:\n\nIn the basis |+y>, |-y>, the matrix elements are:\n\n[S_z]_{+y, +y} = < +y | S_z | +y > = 0, because S_z |+y> = \u0127/2 | -y >.\n\nSimilarly, [S_z]_{+y, -y} = < +y | S_z | -y >.\n\nCompute S_z | -y >.\n\nS_z | -y > = ( S_z |+z> - S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> - (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + (\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nSo < +y | S_z | -y > = < +y | (\u0127/2) | +y > = (\u0127/2) < +y | +y > = \u0127/2.\n\nWait, so [S_z]_{+y, -y} = \u0127/2.\n\nSimilarly, [S_z]_{-y, +y} = < -y | S_z | +y >.\n\nFrom earlier, S_z | +y > = \u0127/2 | -y >.\n\nSo < -y | S_z | +y > = (\u0127/2) < -y | -y > = \u0127/2.\n\nAnd [S_z]_{-y, -y} = < -y | S_z | -y >.\n\nS_z | -y > = (\u0127/2) | +y >.\n\nSo < -y | S_z | -y > = (\u0127/2) < -y | +y > = 0.\n\nPutting it all together, the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis is:\n\n[ [ 0, \u0127/2 ],\n  [ \u0127/2, 0 ] ]\n\nSo S_z = (\u0127/2) [ [0,1], [1,0] ] in this basis.\n\nSo in this basis, the expectation value of S_z in the state \u03c8(t) is given by:\n\n\u03c8(t) is [ e^{i a t}, e^{-i a t} ]^T / sqrt(2), where a = gamma B /2.\n\nBecause in the |+y>, |-y> basis, \u03c8(t) is (|+y> e^{i a t} + |-y> e^{-i a t}) / sqrt(2). So the vector is (e^{i a t}, e^{-i a t}) / sqrt(2).\n\nThe expectation value is \u03c8\u2020 S_z \u03c8.\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(2)) (e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t}) ) multiplied by (\u0127/2) [ [0,1], [1,0] ] multiplied by (1/sqrt(2)) (e^{i a t}, e^{-i a t} ) ).\n\nLet me compute this as a scalar product.\n\nFirst, compute the product:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] * (\u0127/2) [ [0,1], [1,0] ] * (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i a t}, e^{-i a t} ]^T.\n\nLet me compute the matrix multiplication first.\n\nThe middle matrix is:\n\n(\u0127/2) [ [0,1], [1,0] ]\n\nMultiply by the vector (e^{i a t}, e^{-i a t}):\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ 0 * e^{i a t} + 1 * e^{-i a t}, 1 * e^{i a t} + 0 * e^{-i a t} ]^T\n= (\u0127/2) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ]^T.\n\nNow, the outer product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] * (\u0127/2) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ]^T.\n\nWait, no. The outer product is the conjugate transpose (since it's a row vector) times the vector. So:\n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] * (\u0127/2) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ]^T.\n\nWait, no, actually, the first vector is a row vector [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ], and the result of the matrix multiplication is a column vector [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] multiplied by (\u0127/2). So the product is [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] * (\u0127/2) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ]^T.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the order. The correct order is:\n\nThe outer vector is (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ].\n\nMultiply by the matrix product (\u0127/2) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ]^T.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it as:\n\nThe product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] * (\u0127/2) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ]^T.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the matrix is 2x2, and the vectors are 1x2 and 2x1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the entire expression step by step.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] * (\u0127/2) [ [0,1], [1,0] ] * (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i a t}, e^{-i a t} ]^T.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n(\u0127/(2*2)) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] [0 1; 1 0] [ e^{i a t}; e^{-i a t} ].\n\nWait, let me compute the matrix product first. The matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], multiplied by the vector [e^{i a t}, e^{-i a t}].\n\nSo, the first element is 0 * e^{i a t} + 1 * e^{-i a t} = e^{-i a t}.\n\nThe second element is 1 * e^{i a t} + 0 * e^{-i a t} = e^{i a t}.\n\nSo the result is [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ].\n\nNow, multiply [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] with [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ].\n\nSo the dot product is e^{-i a t} * e^{-i a t} + e^{i a t} * e^{i a t}.\n\nWhich is e^{-2 i a t} + e^{2 i a t} = 2 cos(2 a t).\n\nSo putting it all together, the expectation value is:\n\n(\u0127/(4)) * 2 cos(2 a t) ) = (\u0127/2) cos(2 a t).\n\nBut wait, a is gamma B / 2, so 2 a = gamma B.\n\nSo <S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nWait, but wait, the initial calculation was for the expectation value in the state \u03c8(t). So the oscillation is in the z-component of the spin, and its expectation value oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma <S_z>.\n\nSo <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but gamma here is the gyromagnetic ratio. Wait, I thought mu = gamma S. So yes, mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo the average mu_z oscillates as (gamma \u0127 / 2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nThe frequency of oscillation is the coefficient of t inside the cosine. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option B is gamma B, which would make the oscillation frequency gamma B.\n\nWait, but I thought that when the field changes, the precession frequency is given by gamma B. But in the case of spin-1/2, when the field is along a different axis, the precession frequency might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing this with the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B. So in this case, the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is the Larmor frequency. So the answer should be gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps. When I computed <S_z>, I found it oscillates as (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ). So the frequency is gamma B. Since mu_z is gamma S_z, the oscillation of mu_z would be gamma * (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is still gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the units: gamma is in (rad s^-1 T^-1), B is in T. So gamma B is in rad s^-1, which is angular frequency, which is correct.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the correct answer is option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction.

The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, corresponding to $|+z\\rangle$, since the magnetic field is initially along $+z$.\n\n2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the magnetic field switches to $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes:\n   \\[\n   H = -\\gamma B S_y\n   \\]\n   The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\\pm \\hbar/2$.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.\n\nAlright, the setup: there's a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu. Oh wait, mu is given as gamma times S_z. Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think. The initial magnetic field is along +Z, so the magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then suddenly, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. Its spin is aligned, so its magnetic moment is along Z. Then the field switches to Y. I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the spin will precess around the new field direction. But how does that affect the expectation value of the z-component?\n\nHmm, spin-1/2 particles have their spin in a particular state. The initial state is probably an eigenstate of S_z because the magnetic field is along Z. So the state is |+z> or something like that.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly changed to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The original Hamiltonian was proportional to S_z, and now it's proportional to S_y. The time evolution will be governed by the new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe oscillation frequency probably comes from the energy difference between the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. Let me think about the energy levels.\n\nThe magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. So H = -gamma B (S \u00b7 n), where n is the direction of B. Initially, n was along z, now along y.\n\nSo when B is along y, H is proportional to S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +hbar/2 and -hbar/2. Wait, but spin matrices... S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. But the Hamiltonian would be H = -gamma B S_y. So the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2), because S_y |\u00b1y> = \u00b1 \u0127/2 |\u00b1y>.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check. The Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B. Oh, wait, mu is gamma S. So H = -gamma B (S \u00b7 n). So if B is along y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of H are E = -gamma B (s), where s is the eigenvalue of S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2) * (-1)? Wait, no. Let me compute.\n\nH = -gamma B S_y.\n\nS_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nSo H|+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y> \u2192 E_+ = -gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nSimilarly, S_y |-y> = (-\u0127/2)|-y>.\n\nH| -y> = -gamma B (-\u0127/2)|-y> \u2192 E_- = gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nWait, so the energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = +gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nThe time evolution of a state is determined by these energy levels. The initial state is |+z>, since the particle was in a magnetic field along Z. So after the field changes to Y, the state is still |+z>, but the Hamiltonian is now H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nThe state |+z> can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>. Let me think about that. The states |+y> and |-y> are linear combinations of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nThe standard expressions are:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo when the Hamiltonian changes to H, the state will evolve as a combination of the energy eigenstates |+y> and |-y>.\n\nEach component will pick up a phase factor. The time evolution for each eigenstate is e^{-i E t / \u0127}.\n\nSo for |+y>, E = -gamma B \u0127/2. The phase factor is e^{-i (-gamma B \u0127/2) t / \u0127} = e^{i gamma B t / 2}.\n\nFor |-y>, E = gamma B \u0127/2. The phase factor is e^{-i (gamma B \u0127/2) t / \u0127} = e^{-i gamma B t / 2}.\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n\u03c8(t) = (|+y> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |-y> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but the initial state was |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). So after time t, each term evolves with their respective phases.\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nLet me compute that. S_z is the operator, and the states involved are |+y> and |-y>.\n\nWait, let me write \u03c8(t) as [e^{i a t} |+y> + e^{-i a t} |-y> ] / sqrt(2), where a = gamma B /2.\n\nSo \u03c8(t) = ( e^{i a t} |+y> + e^{-i a t} |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nThen, S_z \u03c8(t) = S_z [ ... ].\n\nBut S_z |+y> and S_z |-y> can be computed. Let me remember that S_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2). Wait no, wait. Let me think about matrix representations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> directly.\n\nCompute <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nLet me write \u03c8(t) as (|+y> e^{i a t} + |-y> e^{-i a t}) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 is ( <+y| e^{-i a t} + < -y| e^{i a t} ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 S_z \u03c8 = [ ( <+y| e^{-i a t} + < -y| e^{i a t} ) / sqrt(2) ) ] S_z [ ( |+y> e^{i a t} + |-y> e^{-i a t} ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n\nMultiplying this out:\n\n= [ ( <+y| e^{-i a t} + < -y| e^{i a t} ) ( |+y> e^{i a t} + |-y> e^{-i a t} ) ) ] / 2.\n\nExpanding:\n\n= [ <+y|+y> e^{-i a t} e^{i a t} + <+y| -y> e^{-i a t} e^{-i a t} + < -y| +y> e^{i a t} e^{i a t} + < -y| -y> e^{i a t} e^{-i a t} ] / 2.\n\nBut <+y| -y> and < -y| +y> are zero because they're orthogonal.\n\nSo only the first and last terms remain:\n\n= [ <+y|+y> e^{0} + < -y| -y> e^{0} ] / 2.\n\nSince <+y|+y> = 1, < -y| -y> =1.\n\nSo this is (1 + 1)/2 = 1. But wait, that's just the scalar, but S_z is acting on the state. Did I make a mistake in the expansion? Hmm, perhaps I should compute this more carefully.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of expectation values. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express S_z in the |+y> and |-y> basis.\n\nIn the |+y> and |-y> basis, S_z can be written as a matrix. Let me compute the matrix elements.\n\nWe know that |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nS_z |+z> = (\u0127/2)|+z>, S_z |-z> = (-\u0127/2)|-z>.\n\nSo S_z |+y> = (S_z |+z> + S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= \u0127/2 [ |+z> - |-z> ] / sqrt(2)\n= \u0127/2 ( (|+y> - |-y> ) / sqrt(2) ) * 2? Wait, no.\n\nWait, let me compute S_z |+y>.\n\nWe have S_z |+y> = S_z (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) \n= (S_z |+z> + S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2)( |+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) ( (|+y> + |-y> ) + (|+y> - |-y> ) ) ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) )?\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Maybe a better way is to find the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y> and |-y> basis.\n\nThe states are |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe matrix elements would be:\n\n<S_z>_{+y, +y} = < +y | S_z | +y >.\n\nSimilarly for other elements.\n\nCompute < +y | S_z | +y >.\n\nUsing the expressions:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\nSo S_z |+y> = ( S_z |+z> + S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ( |+z> - |-z> )\nBut |+z> - |-z> = sqrt(2) | -y >.\n\nBecause |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2),\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo |+z> - |-z> = sqrt(2) |-y> \u2192 S_z |+y> = \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * sqrt(2) | -y > = \u0127/2 | -y >.\n\nWait, but that's the action of S_z on |+y>. So the matrix element < +y | S_z | +y > is zero because S_z |+y> is | -y > times \u0127/2, and < +y | -y > is zero.\n\nWait, no, the matrix elements would be:\n\nIn the basis |+y>, |-y>, the matrix elements are:\n\n[S_z]_{+y, +y} = < +y | S_z | +y > = 0, because S_z |+y> = \u0127/2 | -y >.\n\nSimilarly, [S_z]_{+y, -y} = < +y | S_z | -y >.\n\nCompute S_z | -y >.\n\nS_z | -y > = ( S_z |+z> - S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> - (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + (\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nSo < +y | S_z | -y > = < +y | (\u0127/2) | +y > = (\u0127/2) < +y | +y > = \u0127/2.\n\nWait, so [S_z]_{+y, -y} = \u0127/2.\n\nSimilarly, [S_z]_{-y, +y} = < -y | S_z | +y >.\n\nFrom earlier, S_z | +y > = \u0127/2 | -y >.\n\nSo < -y | S_z | +y > = (\u0127/2) < -y | -y > = \u0127/2.\n\nAnd [S_z]_{-y, -y} = < -y | S_z | -y >.\n\nS_z | -y > = (\u0127/2) | +y >.\n\nSo < -y | S_z | -y > = (\u0127/2) < -y | +y > = 0.\n\nPutting it all together, the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis is:\n\n[ [ 0, \u0127/2 ],\n  [ \u0127/2, 0 ] ]\n\nSo S_z = (\u0127/2) [ [0,1], [1,0] ] in this basis.\n\nSo in this basis, the expectation value of S_z in the state \u03c8(t) is given by:\n\n\u03c8(t) is [ e^{i a t}, e^{-i a t} ]^T / sqrt(2), where a = gamma B /2.\n\nBecause in the |+y>, |-y> basis, \u03c8(t) is (|+y> e^{i a t} + |-y> e^{-i a t}) / sqrt(2). So the vector is (e^{i a t}, e^{-i a t}) / sqrt(2).\n\nThe expectation value is \u03c8\u2020 S_z \u03c8.\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(2)) (e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t}) ) multiplied by (\u0127/2) [ [0,1], [1,0] ] multiplied by (1/sqrt(2)) (e^{i a t}, e^{-i a t} ) ).\n\nLet me compute this as a scalar product.\n\nFirst, compute the product:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] * (\u0127/2) [ [0,1], [1,0] ] * (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i a t}, e^{-i a t} ]^T.\n\nLet me compute the matrix multiplication first.\n\nThe middle matrix is:\n\n(\u0127/2) [ [0,1], [1,0] ]\n\nMultiply by the vector (e^{i a t}, e^{-i a t}):\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ 0 * e^{i a t} + 1 * e^{-i a t}, 1 * e^{i a t} + 0 * e^{-i a t} ]^T\n= (\u0127/2) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ]^T.\n\nNow, the outer product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] * (\u0127/2) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ]^T.\n\nWait, no. The outer product is the conjugate transpose (since it's a row vector) times the vector. So:\n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] * (\u0127/2) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ]^T.\n\nWait, no, actually, the first vector is a row vector [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ], and the result of the matrix multiplication is a column vector [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] multiplied by (\u0127/2). So the product is [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] * (\u0127/2) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ]^T.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the order. The correct order is:\n\nThe outer vector is (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ].\n\nMultiply by the matrix product (\u0127/2) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ]^T.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it as:\n\nThe product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] * (\u0127/2) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ]^T.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the matrix is 2x2, and the vectors are 1x2 and 2x1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the entire expression step by step.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] * (\u0127/2) [ [0,1], [1,0] ] * (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i a t}, e^{-i a t} ]^T.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n(\u0127/(2*2)) [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] [0 1; 1 0] [ e^{i a t}; e^{-i a t} ].\n\nWait, let me compute the matrix product first. The matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], multiplied by the vector [e^{i a t}, e^{-i a t}].\n\nSo, the first element is 0 * e^{i a t} + 1 * e^{-i a t} = e^{-i a t}.\n\nThe second element is 1 * e^{i a t} + 0 * e^{-i a t} = e^{i a t}.\n\nSo the result is [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ].\n\nNow, multiply [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ] with [ e^{-i a t}, e^{i a t} ].\n\nSo the dot product is e^{-i a t} * e^{-i a t} + e^{i a t} * e^{i a t}.\n\nWhich is e^{-2 i a t} + e^{2 i a t} = 2 cos(2 a t).\n\nSo putting it all together, the expectation value is:\n\n(\u0127/(4)) * 2 cos(2 a t) ) = (\u0127/2) cos(2 a t).\n\nBut wait, a is gamma B / 2, so 2 a = gamma B.\n\nSo <S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nWait, but wait, the initial calculation was for the expectation value in the state \u03c8(t). So the oscillation is in the z-component of the spin, and its expectation value oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma <S_z>.\n\nSo <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but gamma here is the gyromagnetic ratio. Wait, I thought mu = gamma S. So yes, mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo the average mu_z oscillates as (gamma \u0127 / 2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nThe frequency of oscillation is the coefficient of t inside the cosine. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option B is gamma B, which would make the oscillation frequency gamma B.\n\nWait, but I thought that when the field changes, the precession frequency is given by gamma B. But in the case of spin-1/2, when the field is along a different axis, the precession frequency might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing this with the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B. So in this case, the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is the Larmor frequency. So the answer should be gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps. When I computed <S_z>, I found it oscillates as (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ). So the frequency is gamma B. Since mu_z is gamma S_z, the oscillation of mu_z would be gamma * (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is still gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the units: gamma is in (rad s^-1 T^-1), B is in T. So gamma B is in rad s^-1, which is angular frequency, which is correct.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then suddenly switched to point along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, corresponding to $|+z\\rangle$, since the magnetic field is initially along $+z$.\n\n2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the magnetic field switches to $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes:\n   \\[\n   H = -\\gamma B S_y\n   \\]\n   The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\\pm \\hbar/2$. The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n   \\[\n   E_+ = -\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}, \\quad E_- = \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$:\n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   After the field switches, the state evolves as:\n   \\[\n   \\psi(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{-iE_+t/\\hbar} |+y\\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\\hbar} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   Substituting the energy eigenvalues:\n   \\[\n   \\psi(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{i\\gamma B t/2} |+y\\rangle + e^{-i\\gamma B t/2} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expectation Value of $\\mu_z$**: The magnetic moment in the $z$-direction is $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$. To compute $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle.\n   \\]\n   Using the basis states $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, the matrix representation of $S_z$ is:\n   \\[\n   S_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n   \\]\n   Substituting $\\psi(t)$ and performing the computation, the expectation value of $S_z$ oscillates as:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the expectation value of $\\mu_z$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n\n5. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation frequency is determined by the argument of the cosine term, $\\gamma B$. Thus, the frequency of oscillation is $\\gamma B$.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nANSWER: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these quantum mechanics concepts, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. The magnetic moment mu is aligned with the field. Then the field switches to Y. I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which affects the energy levels and the dynamics of the spin.\n\nSo, the system's initial state is when the magnetic field is along Z. For a spin-1/2 particle, the Sz operator has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. Since mu is gamma* Sz, the magnetic moment would be along Z as well. But when the field is suddenly changed to Y, the Hamiltonian changes from H_initial to H_final.\n\nWait, what's the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field? Oh right, the energy is given by the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. So H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Oh wait, wait, wait, wait. I think I might have that backwards. Because the potential energy for a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is U = -\u03bc\u00b7B. So the Hamiltonian would be H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Or wait, sometimes I've seen it written as H = -\u03b3 B\u00b7S, but I think the key is the relation between mu and the spin.\n\nWait, the problem states that mu = gamma * Sz. So mu is aligned along the z-axis. So the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B_initial. Since B_initial is along +Z, it's H_initial = -gamma Sz B. But wait, when the field is along Z, the magnetic moment is along Z, so the energy is proportional to Sz. That makes sense.\n\nThen, when the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = - mu \u00b7 B_final. B_final is along +Y, so H_final = - gamma (S\u00b7Y) B. Wait, but S is a vector operator. S\u00b7Y would be Sx multiplied by the Y component, right? Because the Y direction is the middle of the axes, so the dot product would involve Sx, Sy, and Sz multiplied by the components of the Y unit vector.\n\nWait, the Y unit vector is (0,1,0). So S\u00b7Y would be Sy. So H_final = - gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but Sy is the spin in the y-direction. So the Hamiltonian after the switch is proportional to Sy.\n\nBut wait, the spin state was initially aligned with the Z field, so the initial state was an eigenstate of Sz. When the field changes, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, which is proportional to Sy. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment, which is <mu_z>, since mu = gamma Sz, so <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding how <Sz> oscillates over time after the Hamiltonian changes.\n\nHmm. I think this is a time-dependent quantum mechanics problem. But since the switch is sudden, it's more of a change in the Hamiltonian at t=0, and the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian.\n\nSo the initial state at t=0- is the eigenstate of Sz. Let's say the state is |+z> or |\u2212z>, but given that the magnetic moment is aligned with the field, which was along +Z, the initial state is probably the eigenstate with the highest energy, which is |+z> with Sz = +\u0127/2.\n\nWait, but mu is gamma * Sz, so the magnetic moment is aligned with B, so when B is along +Z, the particle's moment is along +Z, so the state is |+z>.\n\nAt t=0, the Hamiltonian suddenly changes to H = - gamma B Sy. Wait, wait, because Sy is the spin in y-direction. So the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should write H = w Sy, where w is some frequency. Let's see, H = - gamma B Sy. Wait, but Sy has units of \u0127, so gamma B has units of (something) per second, perhaps.\n\nWait, let me think about the units. Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, which has units of (rad s\u22121 T\u22121). So gamma * B would have units of rad s\u22121. So the Hamiltonian's units would be energy, so I think I need to include Planck's constant in there. Hmm, perhaps H = gamma B Sy * something.\n\nWait, maybe I should express the Hamiltonian in terms of the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B. So the Hamiltonian can be written as H = - (gamma B) Sy.\n\nWait, but Sy is in units of \u0127. So perhaps H = - (gamma B) (\u0127/2) Sy / (\u0127/2). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me proceed without worrying about the units for now.\n\nThe state at t=0 is |+z>. The new Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B Sy. Let me express Sy in terms of ladder operators. Sy = (S+ + S\u2212)/2 * i? Wait, I think S+ and S\u2212 are the raising and lowering operators. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the time evolution of the state under the new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe time evolution is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation: i\u0127 d|psi>/dt = H |psi>.\n\nThe eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of Sy. The eigenstates of Sy are superpositions of |+z> and |\u2212z> states. Let me denote the eigenstates as |+y> and |\u2212y>, which are the eigenstates of Sy with eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and \u2212\u0127/2, respectively.\n\nThe initial state is |+z>, which can be written in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y> states. Let me find the expansion of |+z> in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>.\n\nThe states |+y> and |\u2212y> can be expressed as:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/\u221a2\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z>)/\u221a2\n\nSo, the initial state |+z> can be written as a combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/\u221a2.\n\nSo the initial state is a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.\n\nUnder the new Hamiltonian H, each energy eigenstate |+y> and |\u2212y> will pick up a phase factor over time. The time evolution for each state is |psi_n> = exp( -i E_n t / \u0127 ) |n>, where |n> is an eigenstate with energy E_n.\n\nThe energies for H are: H |+y> = E_+ |+y>, and H |\u2212y> = E_- |\u2212y>.\n\nWait, what's H exactly? Let's compute H.\n\nH = - gamma B Sy.\n\nSy has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E_+ = - gamma B ( \u0127/2 )\nE_- = - gamma B (- \u0127/2 ) = + gamma B ( \u0127/2 )\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because Sy |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = - gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nWait, so E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = + gamma B ( \u0127/2 )\n\nWait, but then the energies are E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127)/2, E_- = + (gamma B \u0127)/2.\n\nSo, the time evolution of each state is:\n\n|+y> \u2192 exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) |+y> = exp( i (gamma B t / 2) ) |+y>\n|\u2212y> \u2192 exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) |\u2212y> = exp( -i (gamma B t / 2 ) ) |\u2212y>\n\nBecause E_+ is negative, so E_+/\u0127 is -gamma B/(2 \u0127) * \u0127 \u2192 E_+ t / \u0127 = (- gamma B t / 2 ) \u2192 the exponential becomes e^{-i (-gamma B t/2)} }= e^{i gamma B t/2}.\n\nSimilarly for E_-.\n\nSo the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nThe time-evolved state is:\n\n|psi(t)> = ( e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{ - i gamma B t/2 } |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, I need to find the expectation value of Sz, which is <Sz> = (gamma)^{-1} <mu_z> / gamma? Wait, no. Wait, mu_z = gamma Sz, so <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.\n\nBut I'm supposed to find the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>, which is gamma times the oscillation frequency of <Sz>.\n\nSo let's compute <Sz> as a function of time.\n\nExpress |psi(t)> in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z> so that we can compute <Sz>.\n\nWe have |+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting into |psi(t)>:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nLet me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from each term:\n\n= [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) )\n\nWhere theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSimplifying denominator: sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2.\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) ] / 2\n\nLet me distribute the exponential terms:\n\n= [ (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) |+z> + (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) |\u2212z> ) ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula:\n\ne^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos(theta)\ne^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin(theta)\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> + 2i sin(theta) |\u2212z> ) ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z>\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z>\n\nNow, the expectation value of Sz is <Sz> = <psi(t)| Sz | psi(t) >.\n\nCompute this:\n\nSz |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>\nSz |\u2212z> = (-\u0127/2) |\u2212z>\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = [ cos(theta) < +z | + i sin(theta) < \u2212z | ] Sz [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z> ]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= cos(theta)^2 < +z | Sz | +z > + i cos(theta) sin(theta) < +z | Sz | \u2212z > \n+ i sin(theta) cos(theta) < \u2212z | Sz | +z > \n+ i^2 sin(theta)^2 < \u2212z | Sz | \u2212z >\n\nBut < +z | Sz | \u2212z > is zero because |+z> and |\u2212z> are eigenstates with different eigenvalues.\n\nSo,\n\n= cos(theta)^2 (\u0127/2) + (i^2) sin(theta)^2 (-\u0127/2 )\n\nSince i^2 = -1,\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]\n\nWhich is (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta )\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta )\n\nBut theta is (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation of <Sz> is at frequency gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the oscillation of <mu_z>, which is gamma <Sz>.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma <Sz> = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma*B, which is the frequency.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the initial setup of the Hamiltonian? Because when the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, but the energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So H = - gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but when I computed the energy levels, I took E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energies are spaced by (gamma B \u0127).\n\nBut when we compute the time evolution, the phase factor is exp( -i E_n t / \u0127 ), so for E_+, it's exp( i gamma B t / 2 ), and for E_-, it's exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ).\n\nSo the time dependence of the coefficients leads to terms like e^{i gamma B t/2} and e^{-i gamma B t/2}.\n\nWhen we calculate <Sz>, the frequency comes out as gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma*B, which would be the correct answer.\n",

The time evolution for each state is |psi_n> = exp( -i E_n t / \u0127 ) |n>, where |n> is an eigenstate with energy E_n.\n\nThe energies for H are: H |+y> = E_+ |+y>, and H |\u2212y> = E_- |\u2212y>.\n\nWait, what's H exactly? Let's compute H.\n\nH = - gamma B Sy.\n\nSy has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E_+ = - gamma B ( \u0127/2 )\nE_- = - gamma B (- \u0127/2 ) = + gamma B ( \u0127/2 )\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because Sy |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = - gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nWait, so E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = + gamma B ( \u0127/2 )\n\nWait, but then the energies are E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127)/2, E_- = + (gamma B \u0127)/2.\n\nSo, the time evolution of each state is:\n\n|+y> \u2192 exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) |+y> = exp( i (gamma B t / 2) ) |+y>\n|\u2212y> \u2192 exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) |\u2212y> = exp( -i (gamma B t / 2 ) ) |\u2212y>\n\nBecause E_+ is negative, so E_+/\u0127 is -gamma B/(2 \u0127) * \u0127 \u2192 E_+ t / \u0127 = (- gamma B t / 2 ) \u2192 the exponential becomes e^{-i (-gamma B t/2)} }= e^{i gamma B t/2}.\n\nSimilarly for E_-.\n\nSo the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nThe time-evolved state is:\n\n|psi(t)> = ( e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{ - i gamma B t/2 } |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, I need to find the expectation value of Sz, which is <Sz> = (gamma)^{-1} <mu_z> / gamma? Wait, no. Wait, mu_z = gamma Sz, so <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.\n\nBut I'm supposed to find the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>, which is gamma times the oscillation frequency of <Sz>.\n\nSo let's compute <Sz> as a function of time.\n\nExpress |psi(t)> in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z> so that we can compute <Sz>.\n\nWe have |+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting into |psi(t)>:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nLet me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from each term:\n\n= [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) )\n\nWhere theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSimplifying denominator: sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2.\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) ] / 2\n\nLet me distribute the exponential terms:\n\n= [ (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) |+z> + (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) |\u2212z> ) ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula:\n\ne^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos(theta)\ne^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin(theta)\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> + 2i sin(theta) |\u2212z> ) ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z>\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z>\n\nNow, the expectation value of Sz is <Sz> = <psi(t)| Sz | psi(t) >.\n\nCompute this:\n\nSz |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>\nSz |\u2212z> = (-\u0127/2) |\u2212z>\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = [ cos(theta) < +z | + i sin(theta) < \u2212z | ] Sz [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z> ]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= cos(theta)^2 < +z | Sz | +z > + i cos(theta) sin(theta) < +z | Sz | \u2212z > \n+ i sin(theta) cos(theta) < \u2212z | Sz | +z > \n+ i^2 sin(theta)^2 < \u2212z | Sz | \u2212z >\n\nBut < +z | Sz | \u2212z > is zero because |+z> and |\u2212z> are eigenstates with different eigenvalues.\n\nSo,\n\n= cos(theta)^2 (\u0127/2) + (i^2) sin(theta)^2 (-\u0127/2 )\n\nSince i^2 = -1,\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]\n\nWhich is (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta )\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta )\n\nBut theta is (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation of <Sz> is at frequency gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the oscillation of <mu_z>, which is gamma <Sz>.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma <Sz> = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma*B, which is the frequency.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the initial setup of the Hamiltonian? Because when the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, but the energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So H = - gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but when I computed the energy levels, I took E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energies are spaced by (gamma B \u0127).\n\nBut when we compute the time evolution, the phase factor is exp( -i E_n t / \u0127 ), so for E_+, it's exp( i gamma B t / 2 ), and for E_-, it's exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ).\n\nSo the time dependence of the coefficients leads to terms like e^{i gamma B t/2} and e^{-i gamma B t/2}.\n\nWhen we calculate <Sz>, the frequency comes out as gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma*B, which would be the correct answer.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. At $t=0$, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to point along the $+y$ direction, and the task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\\rangle$, since the magnetic moment is aligned with the initial $z$-field.\n\n2. **Hamiltonian Change**: When the magnetic field switches to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes:\n   \\[\n   H = -\\mu \\cdot B = -\\gamma B S_y,\n   \\]\n   where $S_y$ is the spin operator in the $y$-direction.\n\n3. **Eigenstates of $S_y$**: The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|\u2212y\\rangle$, corresponding to eigenvalues $+\\hbar/2$ and $\u2212\\hbar/2$, respectively. These eigenstates can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   |+y\\rangle = \\frac{|+z\\rangle + |\u2212z\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\quad |\u2212y\\rangle = \\frac{|+z\\rangle - |\u2212z\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Initial State in New Basis**: The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ can be rewritten in terms of $|+y\\rangle$ and $|\u2212y\\rangle$:\n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{|+y\\rangle + |\u2212y\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Time Evolution**: Under the new Hamiltonian $H = -\\gamma B S_y$, the eigenstates $|+y\\rangle$ and $|\u2212y\\rangle$ evolve with time-dependent phase factors:\n   \\[\n   |+y\\rangle \\to e^{i\\gamma B t/2}|+y\\rangle, \\quad |\u2212y\\rangle \\to e^{-i\\gamma B t/2}|\u2212y\\rangle.\n   \\]\n   Substituting into the expression for $|+z\\rangle$, the time-evolved state becomes:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos(\\gamma B t/2)|+z\\rangle + i\\sin(\\gamma B t/2)|\u2212z\\rangle.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: The expectation value of $S_z$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle.\n   \\]\n   Using the time-evolved state, this evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n\n7. **Oscillation of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$**: Since $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$, the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment is:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   The oscillation frequency of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ is therefore $\\gamma B$.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s moment is $\\gamma B$. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nThe problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. So mu = \u03b3Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. After this change, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. The question is about finding the oscillation frequency of this average.\n\nHmm, I remember that when a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque. The energy levels are quantized because of the spin. But in this case, the magnetic field is suddenly changed from Z to Y. Oh right, this is a time-dependent perturbation problem, maybe. Or perhaps it's about precession.\n\nWait, the particle's magnetic moment is mu = \u03b3Sz. So initially, when the field is along Z, the energy levels are determined by the Sz component. The magnetic moment will align with the field for the lower energy state and opposite for the higher. But when the field is turned off, the magnetic moment is no longer in a static field, so it's free to precess.\n\nWait, no. After the field is turned off, the field is then turned on along Y. So the field is now in the Y direction. So the system's Hamiltonian changes from something with Sz to something with Sy.\n\nWait, the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu\u00b7B. Since mu is \u03b3 Sz, then H_initial would be proportional to Sz. But when the field is along Y, then H_final is proportional to Sy.\n\nWait, but the problem says the magnetic field is turned off and then another one turned on. So the initial state is when the field was along Z, and the particle is in some state. Then the field is changed, and the new Hamiltonian is along Y.\n\nBut wait, if the field is turned off and then on in Y, the state of the particle might change. But since the change is sudden, perhaps the state doesn't immediately change\u2014maybe it's a sudden approximation problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is about the time evolution under a magnetic field in a different direction, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nWait, the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillating. So we're looking at \u27e8Sz\u27e9 as a function of time. The problem is asking about the frequency of oscillations in this average.\n\nI recall that when a spin-\u00bd particle is placed in a magnetic field along a direction that's not aligned with its spin, it can precess, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nIn the case of a magnetic field along a different axis, like going from Z to Y, the spin will precess around the Y-axis. The expectation values of the spin components in other directions (like Z) will oscillate with a certain frequency.\n\nBut wait, the initial state of the spin when the field was along Z. Let's think: before the field is turned off, the particle was in an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say it was in the +z state, which is (1, 0) in spinor notation.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched from Z to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The initial state is still the eigenstate of Sz. Now the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. Because the Hamiltonian is now H = -\u03b3 Sz * B? Wait, no. Let me get the expression right.\n\nWait, the magnetic moment mu is \u03b3 S. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B. Since B is along Y and has magnitude B, it's H = -\u03b3 B (S_y).\n\nWait, no, the dot product would be S_y multiplied by B. So H = - \u03b3 B S_y. But wait, the units might be a bit different. Let me think: the magnetic moment is mu = \u03b3 S, so mu \u00b7 B is the energy term. So H = - mu \u00b7 B = - \u03b3 (S \u00b7 B). So if B is along Y, then H = - \u03b3 B S_y.\n\nWait, but in terms of spin matrices, Sy is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix \u03c3y. So H would be proportional to \u03c3y.\n\nBut the initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is (1, 0). So we can write the time evolution under the new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. But since the Hamiltonian is time-independent after the switch, the solution is straightforward.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). So the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t) |+z\u27e9.\n\nWe can compute the expectation value of Sz in this state, \u27e8Sz\u27e9, as a function of time.\n\nSo let's calculate this.\n\nFirst, let's write H in terms of Pauli matrices. H = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. Because S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3y.\n\nSo H = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y.\n\nThen, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( i (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y t / \u0127 ) ) = exp( i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t )\n\nWait, because the exponent is (-i H t / \u0127 ), so H is negative, so the exponent becomes positive.\n\nLet me re-calculate that: H = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y, so H t / \u0127 = - (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t.\n\nSo the exponent is (-i H t / \u0127 ) = i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t.\n\nSo U(t) = exp( i (\u03b3 B t / 2) \u03c3y )\n\nNow, the initial state |+z\u27e9 is (1, 0).\n\nWe can compute U(t) acting on |+z\u27e9.\n\nThe matrix exponential for \u03c3y can be expressed using Euler's formula. Remember that \u03c3y has eigenvalues i and -i, but more importantly, when exponentiated, it can be written in terms of sine and cosine.\n\nAlternatively, since \u03c3y^2 = I, so any function of \u03c3y can be written as a linear combination of I and \u03c3y.\n\nThe exponential of i \u03b8 \u03c3y is cos(\u03b8) I + i sin(\u03b8) \u03c3y.\n\nWait, because for any Pauli matrix \u03c3, e^{i \u03b8 \u03c3} = I cos\u03b8 + i \u03c3 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo in our case, \u03b8 is (\u03b3 B t / 2).\n\nSo U(t) = cos( (\u03b3 B t)/2 ) I + i sin( (\u03b3 B t)/2 ) \u03c3y.\n\nSo now, the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is U(t) |+z\u27e9.\n\nLet me compute that. The initial state |+z\u27e9 is (1, 0).\n\nSo applying U(t) gives:\n\n[ cos(\u03b8) I + i sin(\u03b8) \u03c3y ] (1, 0) \n\nWhere \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t)/2.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nI acting on (1,0) gives (1,0).\n\n\u03c3y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so \u03c3y (1,0) = (0, i).\n\nSo putting it together:\n\ncos\u03b8 * (1, 0) + i sin\u03b8 * (0, i) = \n\nFirst component: cos\u03b8 * 1 + i sin\u03b8 * 0 = cos\u03b8.\n\nSecond component: 0 + i sin\u03b8 * i = i^2 sin\u03b8 = (-1) sin\u03b8.\n\nSo the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is ( cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8 ), where \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t)/2.\n\nNow, the expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is the expectation value of the Sz operator. The Sz operator for spin-\u00bd is (\u0127/2) \u03c3z.\n\nBut wait, the magnetic moment is given as mu = \u03b3 S, so perhaps the Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of mu, but for the expectation value of Sz, we can compute it directly.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is (\u0127/2) times the expectation value of \u03c3z in the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nThe \u03c3z matrix is [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So the expectation value is:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t) | \u03c3z | \u03c8(t) \u27e9.\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nThe state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is ( cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8 ), so the bra is ( cos\u03b8*, i sin\u03b8* ). But since cos\u03b8 is real and sin\u03b8 is real multiplied by -i, the complex conjugate is ( cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8 ).\n\nSo the expectation value is:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 , i sin\u03b8 ] * [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ] * [ cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8 ]\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step.\n\nCompute the matrix product:\n\nFirst, \u03c3z |\u03c8\u27e9 = [[1, 0], [0, -1]] (cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8) = (cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8).\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3z |\u03c8\u27e9 = (cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8)\u2020 (cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. The expectation value is \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z \u03c8.\n\nSo \u03c8 is (cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8), so \u03c8\u2020 is (cos\u03b8*, i sin\u03b8* ). Since \u03b8 is real, \u03c8\u2020 is (cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8 ).\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z is (cos\u03b8 * 1, i sin\u03b8 * (-1) ) = (cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8).\n\nThen, multiply by \u03c8: (cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8) * (cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8).\n\nWait, no, matrix multiplication: \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z \u03c8 is the sum of the products.\n\nWait, no, \u03c8\u2020 is a row vector, \u03c3z is a matrix, and \u03c8 is a column vector. So \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z \u03c8 is a scalar.\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z \u03c8 = [cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8] * [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [cos\u03b8; -i sin\u03b8]\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute it as (cos\u03b8)(1)(cos\u03b8) + (i sin\u03b8)(-1)(-i sin\u03b8).\n\nWait, let me compute each term.\n\nThe first element of \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z is cos\u03b8 * 1 + i sin\u03b8 * 0 = cos\u03b8.\n\nThe second element is cos\u03b8 * 0 + i sin\u03b8 * (-1) = -i sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, \u03c8\u2020 is [cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8], and \u03c3z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z is [cos\u03b8 *1 + i sin\u03b8 *0, cos\u03b8*0 + i sin\u03b8*(-1)] ?\n\nWait, no, matrix multiplication is rows times columns. So to compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z, which is a row vector:\n\nFirst element: (cos\u03b8)(1) + (i sin\u03b8)(0) = cos\u03b8.\n\nSecond element: (cos\u03b8)(0) + (i sin\u03b8)(-1) = -i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z is [cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8].\n\nNow multiply by \u03c8, which is (cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8)^T. So the scalar product is:\n\ncos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 + (-i sin\u03b8) * (-i sin\u03b8).\n\nWhich is cos\u00b2\u03b8 + (i\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nBut i\u00b2 is -1, so this becomes cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut wait, the expectation value of Sz is (\u0127/2) times this.\n\nWait, but in our case, the Hamiltonian is in terms of Sy, so the time evolution is governed by H = - \u03b3 B S_y. So when we compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9, it's the expectation value of Sz in the state evolved under H.\n\nBut wait, in our calculation, the expectation value of \u03c3z is cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos(2\u03b8).\n\nBecause cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos(2\u03b8).\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = cos(2\u03b8).\n\nTherefore, \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8).\n\nWait, but wait. Because earlier, in the expression for H, we had H = -\u03b3 B S_y, which is H = - (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) \u03c3y.\n\nBut when we calculate the time evolution, we used H correctly.\n\nWait, but in any case, the expectation value of Sz is (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8), where \u03b8 is (\u03b3 B t / 2).\n\nSo let's substitute \u03b8 into this.\n\n\u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t) / 2.\n\nSo 2\u03b8 = \u03b3 B t.\n\nSo cos(2\u03b8) = cos(\u03b3 B t).\n\nSo \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t).\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem states that the magnetic moment is mu = \u03b3 Sz. So the z-component of the magnetic moment is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9.\n\nSo the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9.\n\nWhich would be \u03bc_z = \u03b3 * (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t).\n\nBut wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment, which is \u03bc_z.\n\nSo \u03bc_z(t) = (\u03b3 \u0127 / 2) cos(\u03b3 B t).\n\nThe oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, divided by 2\u03c0. Or, the angular frequency is \u03b3 B.\n\nSo the frequency is (\u03b3 B)/(2\u03c0), but wait, the question is asking for the oscillation frequency, which is the number of cycles per second, which is the angular frequency divided by 2\u03c0.\n\nWait, but the options don't involve 2\u03c0. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) gamma*B/2\n\nB) gamma*B\n\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nWait, in our expression, the time dependence is cos(\u03b3 B t). So the angular frequency is \u03c9 = \u03b3 B. So the frequency f is \u03c9/(2\u03c0) = \u03b3 B/(2\u03c0). But that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the expectation value. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when I computed \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9, I got cos(2\u03b8), but maybe I should have considered that the time evolution is under H = \u03c9_0 S_y, where \u03c9_0 is some frequency.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used the energy levels and time evolution in terms of energy differences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frequency is determined by the energy difference between the states.\n\nLet me think differently. The energy levels when the field is along Y are given by E_+ and E_-.\n\nThe eigenvalues of H = - \u03b3 B S_y are E_+ = (\u03b3 B \u0127/2)(+1) and E_- = (- \u03b3 B \u0127/2)(+1) ?\n\nWait, H = - \u03b3 B S_y, and S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)(+1) = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, H = - \u03bc \u00b7 B, and \u03bc = \u03b3 S. So H = - \u03b3 B S \u00b7 direction.\n\nWait, when B is along Y, H = - \u03b3 B S_y. So the eigenvalues are E = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)(\u00b11).\n\nWait, but for spin-1/2, S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So H has eigenvalues E_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)(1/2 * 2?) Wait, no. S_y is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y, so when multiplied by -\u03b3 B, the eigenvalues are E_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) (1) = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2.\n\nWait, no, S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so H = - \u03b3 B S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) * (-1). Wait, no: H = - \u03b3 B (S_y).\n\nSo S_y is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y, so H = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. The eigenvalues of \u03c3_y are \u00b11, so the eigenvalues of H are E_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) (1) = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2, and E_- = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of \u03c3_y are \u00b11, so S_y has eigenvalues (\u0127/2)(\u00b11). So H = - \u03b3 B S_y has eigenvalues - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)(\u00b11) \u2192 \u00b1 (- \u03b3 B \u0127/2).\n\nWait, that would make the eigenvalues E_+ = (- \u03b3 B \u0127/2)(-1) = \u03b3 B \u0127/2? No, wait:\n\nWait, S_y has eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2. So H = - \u03b3 B S_y has eigenvalues:\n\nE_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) (+1) = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2.\n\nE_- = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) (-1) = + (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2.\n\nSo the energy levels are E_+ = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2 and E_- = + (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2.\n\nThe initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is an eigenstate of Sz, not Sy. So the initial state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of Sy.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express |+z\u27e9 in terms of the eigenstates of Sy.\n\nThe eigenstates of Sy are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\n|-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSo |+z\u27e9 can be written as (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSo when the Hamiltonian changes to H = - \u03b3 B S_y, the state |+z\u27e9 becomes a superposition of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, which are eigenstates of H with energies E_+ and E_-.\n\nSo the time evolution of each component is multiplied by a phase factor.\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n( e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127 } |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i E_- t / \u0127 } |\u2212y\u27e9 ) / \u221a2.\n\nSubstituting E_+ = - \u03b3 B \u0127 /2 and E_- = \u03b3 B \u0127 /2.\n\nSo:\n\n( e^{-i (- \u03b3 B \u0127 /2 ) t / \u0127 } |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i (\u03b3 B \u0127 /2 ) t / \u0127 } |\u2212y\u27e9 ) / \u221a2.\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nE_+ term: e^{i (\u03b3 B t / 2) }\n\nE_- term: e^{-i (\u03b3 B t / 2) }\n\nSo the state is:\n\n[ e^{i (\u03b3 B t / 2)} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i (\u03b3 B t / 2)} |\u2212y\u27e9 ] / \u221a2.\n\nNow, express this back in terms of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9.\n\nWe know that:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\n|\u2212y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n[ e^{i (\u03b3 B t / 2)} (|+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 + e^{-i (\u03b3 B t / 2)} (|+z\u27e9 - |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] / \u221a2.\n\nFactor out 1/\u221a2:\n\n1/(\u221a2) [ e^{i \u03b8} (|+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9) + e^{-i \u03b8} (|+z\u27e9 - |-z\u27e9) ] / \u221a2,\n\nwhere \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t /2).\n\nSo overall, 1/(\u221a2 * \u221a2) = 1/2.\n\nExpanding the terms:\n\n= [ e^{i \u03b8} |+z\u27e9 + e^{i \u03b8} |-z\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b8} |+z\u27e9 - e^{-i \u03b8} |-z\u27e9 ] / 2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= [ (e^{i \u03b8} + e^{-i \u03b8}) |+z\u27e9 + (e^{i \u03b8} - e^{-i \u03b8}) |-z\u27e9 ] / 2.\n\nUsing Euler's formula:\n\ne^{i \u03b8} + e^{-i \u03b8} = 2 cos\u03b8,\n\ne^{i \u03b8} - e^{-i \u03b8} = 2i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo:\n\n= [ 2 cos\u03b8 |+z\u27e9 + 2i sin\u03b8 |-z\u27e9 ] / 2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos\u03b8 |+z\u27e9 + i sin\u03b8 |-z\u27e9.\n\nSo the state is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = cos\u03b8 |+z\u27e9 + i sin\u03b8 |-z\u27e9.\n\nNow, the expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is (\u0127/2) [\u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3z |\u03c8\u27e9 ].\n\nBut \u03c3z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) [ |cos\u03b8|^2 (1) + |i sin\u03b8|^2 (-1) ].\n\nWait, because |+z\u27e9 has \u03c3z = +1, |-z\u27e9 has \u03c3z = -1.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2\u03b8 * 1 + (i sin\u03b8)(-i sin\u03b8) * (-1) ]\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9 correctly.\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) [ (cos\u03b8)^2 * 1 + (i sin\u03b8)(-i sin\u03b8) * (-1) ) ].\n\nWait, because the state is a sum of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) [ (cos\u03b8)^2 * (+1) + (i sin\u03b8)^2 * (-1) )\n\nWait, no, perhaps a better approach is to compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9 as the expectation value of Sz in the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nSz is (\u0127/2) \u03c3z, which in the computational basis (|+z\u27e9, |-z\u27e9) is diagonal with entries (\u0127/2, -\u0127/2).\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) [ |cos\u03b8|^2 - |i sin\u03b8|^2 ].\n\nBecause |+z\u27e9 contributes (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2\u03b8, and |-z\u27e9 contributes (-\u0127/2) |i sin\u03b8|^2.\n\nWait, |i sin\u03b8|^2 is (sin\u03b8)^2, since |i|^2 is 1.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 ].\n\nWhich is (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8).\n\nSo the same result as before. So this must be correct.\n\nSo, \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8), where \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t)/2.\n\nSo 2\u03b8 = \u03b3 B t.\n\nSo \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t).\n\nBut the magnetic moment's z-component is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz. So:\n\n\u03bc_z(t) = \u03b3 (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t).\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t in the cosine argument, which is \u03b3 B.\n\nWait, but the angular frequency \u03c9 is equal to \u03b3 B. So the frequency f is \u03c9/(2\u03c0) = \u03b3 B/(2\u03c0).\n\nBut the question is about the oscillation frequency, which could be the angular frequency or the regular frequency. The options are given in terms of gamma*B multiplied by a factor, so perhaps the problem is referring to the angular frequency.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma*B. So if the angular frequency is gamma*B, that would match option B.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the oscillation frequency is gamma*B. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, the time dependence is cos(\u03b3 B t), so the argument is gamma B t. So the angular frequency is gamma B, right? Because angular frequency is the coefficient of t in the cosine function.\n\nSo the answer should be gamma*B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have spin precession, the frequency is given by (gamma B)/something. But in this case, the calculation seems to show that the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, let me think about the energy levels again.\n\nThe energy difference between the two eigenstates is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2) - (- gamma B \u0127/2) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe time period for transitions between states would be determined by this energy difference. The frequency of oscillations in expectation values is given by (E_- - E_+)/\u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the angular frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction.

The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis\n\n1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  \n   - Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\\rangle = (1, 0)$ in spinor notation.  \n   - After the field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\\gamma B S_y$.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nThe problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. So mu = \u03b3Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. After this change, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. The question is about finding the oscillation frequency of this average.\n\nHmm, I remember that when a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque. The energy levels are quantized because of the spin. But in this case, the magnetic field is suddenly changed from Z to Y. Oh right, this is a time-dependent perturbation problem, maybe. Or perhaps it's about precession.\n\nWait, the particle's magnetic moment is mu = \u03b3Sz. So initially, when the field is along Z, the energy levels are determined by the Sz component. The magnetic moment will align with the field for the lower energy state and opposite for the higher. But when the field is turned off, the magnetic moment is no longer in a static field, so it's free to precess.\n\nWait, no. After the field is turned off, the field is then turned on along Y. So the field is now in the Y direction. So the system's Hamiltonian changes from something with Sz to something with Sy.\n\nWait, the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu\u00b7B. Since mu is \u03b3 Sz, then H_initial would be proportional to Sz. But when the field is along Y, then H_final is proportional to Sy.\n\nWait, but the problem says the magnetic field is turned off and then another one turned on. So the initial state is when the field was along Z, and the particle is in some state. Then the field is changed, and the new Hamiltonian is along Y.\n\nBut wait, if the field is turned off and then on in Y, the state of the particle might change. But since the change is sudden, perhaps the state doesn't immediately change\u2014maybe it's a sudden approximation problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is about the time evolution under a magnetic field in a different direction, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nWait, the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillating. So we're looking at \u27e8Sz\u27e9 as a function of time. The problem is asking about the frequency of oscillations in this average.\n\nI recall that when a spin-\u00bd particle is placed in a magnetic field along a direction that's not aligned with its spin, it can precess, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nIn the case of a magnetic field along a different axis, like going from Z to Y, the spin will precess around the Y-axis. The expectation values of the spin components in other directions (like Z) will oscillate with a certain frequency.\n\nBut wait, the initial state of the spin when the field was along Z. Let's think: before the field is turned off, the particle was in an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say it was in the +z state, which is (1, 0) in spinor notation.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched from Z to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The initial state is still the eigenstate of Sz. Now the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. Because the Hamiltonian is now H = -\u03b3 Sz * B? Wait, no. Let me get the expression right.\n\nWait, the magnetic moment mu is \u03b3 S. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B. Since B is along Y and has magnitude B, it's H = -\u03b3 B (S_y).\n\nWait, no, the dot product would be S_y multiplied by B. So H = - \u03b3 B S_y. But wait, the units might be a bit different. Let me think: the magnetic moment is mu = \u03b3 S, so mu \u00b7 B is the energy term. So H = - mu \u00b7 B = - \u03b3 (S \u00b7 B). So if B is along Y, then H = - \u03b3 B S_y.\n\nWait, but in terms of spin matrices, Sy is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix \u03c3y. So H would be proportional to \u03c3y.\n\nBut the initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is (1, 0). So we can write the time evolution under the new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. But since the Hamiltonian is time-independent after the switch, the solution is straightforward.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). So the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t) |+z\u27e9.\n\nWe can compute the expectation value of Sz in this state, \u27e8Sz\u27e9, as a function of time.\n\nSo let's calculate this.\n\nFirst, let's write H in terms of Pauli matrices. H = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. Because S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3y.\n\nSo H = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y.\n\nThen, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( i (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y t / \u0127 ) ) = exp( i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t )\n\nWait, because the exponent is (-i H t / \u0127 ), so H is negative, so the exponent becomes positive.\n\nLet me re-calculate that: H = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y, so H t / \u0127 = - (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t.\n\nSo the exponent is (-i H t / \u0127 ) = i (\u03b3 B / 2) \u03c3y t.\n\nSo U(t) = exp( i (\u03b3 B t / 2) \u03c3y )\n\nNow, the initial state |+z\u27e9 is (1, 0).\n\nWe can compute U(t) acting on |+z\u27e9.\n\nThe matrix exponential for \u03c3y can be expressed using Euler's formula. Remember that \u03c3y has eigenvalues i and -i, but more importantly, when exponentiated, it can be written in terms of sine and cosine.\n\nAlternatively, since \u03c3y^2 = I, so any function of \u03c3y can be written as a linear combination of I and \u03c3y.\n\nThe exponential of i \u03b8 \u03c3y is cos(\u03b8) I + i sin(\u03b8) \u03c3y.\n\nWait, because for any Pauli matrix \u03c3, e^{i \u03b8 \u03c3} = I cos\u03b8 + i \u03c3 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo in our case, \u03b8 is (\u03b3 B t / 2).\n\nSo U(t) = cos( (\u03b3 B t)/2 ) I + i sin( (\u03b3 B t)/2 ) \u03c3y.\n\nSo now, the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is U(t) |+z\u27e9.\n\nLet me compute that. The initial state |+z\u27e9 is (1, 0).\n\nSo applying U(t) gives:\n\n[ cos(\u03b8) I + i sin(\u03b8) \u03c3y ] (1, 0) \n\nWhere \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t)/2.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nI acting on (1,0) gives (1,0).\n\n\u03c3y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so \u03c3y (1,0) = (0, i).\n\nSo putting it together:\n\ncos\u03b8 * (1, 0) + i sin\u03b8 * (0, i) = \n\nFirst component: cos\u03b8 * 1 + i sin\u03b8 * 0 = cos\u03b8.\n\nSecond component: 0 + i sin\u03b8 * i = i^2 sin\u03b8 = (-1) sin\u03b8.\n\nSo the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is ( cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8 ), where \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t)/2.\n\nNow, the expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is the expectation value of the Sz operator. The Sz operator for spin-\u00bd is (\u0127/2) \u03c3z.\n\nBut wait, the magnetic moment is given as mu = \u03b3 S, so perhaps the Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of mu, but for the expectation value of Sz, we can compute it directly.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is (\u0127/2) times the expectation value of \u03c3z in the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nThe \u03c3z matrix is [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So the expectation value is:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t) | \u03c3z | \u03c8(t) \u27e9.\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nThe state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is ( cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8 ), so the bra is ( cos\u03b8*, i sin\u03b8* ). But since cos\u03b8 is real and sin\u03b8 is real multiplied by -i, the complex conjugate is ( cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8 ).\n\nSo the expectation value is:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 , i sin\u03b8 ] * [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ] * [ cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8 ]\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step.\n\nCompute the matrix product:\n\nFirst, \u03c3z |\u03c8\u27e9 = [[1, 0], [0, -1]] (cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8) = (cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8).\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3z |\u03c8\u27e9 = (cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8)\u2020 (cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. The expectation value is \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z \u03c8.\n\nSo \u03c8 is (cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8), so \u03c8\u2020 is (cos\u03b8*, i sin\u03b8* ). Since \u03b8 is real, \u03c8\u2020 is (cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8 ).\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z is (cos\u03b8 * 1, i sin\u03b8 * (-1) ) = (cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8).\n\nThen, multiply by \u03c8: (cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8) * (cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8).\n\nWait, no, matrix multiplication: \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z \u03c8 is the sum of the products.\n\nWait, no, \u03c8\u2020 is a row vector, \u03c3z is a matrix, and \u03c8 is a column vector. So \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z \u03c8 is a scalar.\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z \u03c8 = [cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8] * [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [cos\u03b8; -i sin\u03b8]\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute it as (cos\u03b8)(1)(cos\u03b8) + (i sin\u03b8)(-1)(-i sin\u03b8).\n\nWait, let me compute each term.\n\nThe first element of \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z is cos\u03b8 * 1 + i sin\u03b8 * 0 = cos\u03b8.\n\nThe second element is cos\u03b8 * 0 + i sin\u03b8 * (-1) = -i sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, \u03c8\u2020 is [cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8], and \u03c3z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z is [cos\u03b8 *1 + i sin\u03b8 *0, cos\u03b8*0 + i sin\u03b8*(-1)] ?\n\nWait, no, matrix multiplication is rows times columns. So to compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z, which is a row vector:\n\nFirst element: (cos\u03b8)(1) + (i sin\u03b8)(0) = cos\u03b8.\n\nSecond element: (cos\u03b8)(0) + (i sin\u03b8)(-1) = -i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z is [cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8].\n\nNow multiply by \u03c8, which is (cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8)^T. So the scalar product is:\n\ncos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 + (-i sin\u03b8) * (-i sin\u03b8).\n\nWhich is cos\u00b2\u03b8 + (i\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nBut i\u00b2 is -1, so this becomes cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut wait, the expectation value of Sz is (\u0127/2) times this.\n\nWait, but in our case, the Hamiltonian is in terms of Sy, so the time evolution is governed by H = - \u03b3 B S_y. So when we compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9, it's the expectation value of Sz in the state evolved under H.\n\nBut wait, in our calculation, the expectation value of \u03c3z is cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos(2\u03b8).\n\nBecause cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos(2\u03b8).\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = cos(2\u03b8).\n\nTherefore, \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8).\n\nWait, but wait. Because earlier, in the expression for H, we had H = -\u03b3 B S_y, which is H = - (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) \u03c3y.\n\nBut when we calculate the time evolution, we used H correctly.\n\nWait, but in any case, the expectation value of Sz is (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8), where \u03b8 is (\u03b3 B t / 2).\n\nSo let's substitute \u03b8 into this.\n\n\u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t) / 2.\n\nSo 2\u03b8 = \u03b3 B t.\n\nSo cos(2\u03b8) = cos(\u03b3 B t).\n\nSo \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t).\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem states that the magnetic moment is mu = \u03b3 Sz. So the z-component of the magnetic moment is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9.\n\nSo the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9.\n\nWhich would be \u03bc_z = \u03b3 * (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t).\n\nBut wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment, which is \u03bc_z.\n\nSo \u03bc_z(t) = (\u03b3 \u0127 / 2) cos(\u03b3 B t).\n\nThe oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, divided by 2\u03c0. Or, the angular frequency is \u03b3 B.\n\nSo the frequency is (\u03b3 B)/(2\u03c0), but wait, the question is asking for the oscillation frequency, which is the number of cycles per second, which is the angular frequency divided by 2\u03c0.\n\nWait, but the options don't involve 2\u03c0. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) gamma*B/2\n\nB) gamma*B\n\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nWait, in our expression, the time dependence is cos(\u03b3 B t). So the angular frequency is \u03c9 = \u03b3 B. So the frequency f is \u03c9/(2\u03c0) = \u03b3 B/(2\u03c0). But that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the expectation value. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when I computed \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9, I got cos(2\u03b8), but maybe I should have considered that the time evolution is under H = \u03c9_0 S_y, where \u03c9_0 is some frequency.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used the energy levels and time evolution in terms of energy differences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frequency is determined by the energy difference between the states.\n\nLet me think differently. The energy levels when the field is along Y are given by E_+ and E_-.\n\nThe eigenvalues of H = - \u03b3 B S_y are E_+ = (\u03b3 B \u0127/2)(+1) and E_- = (- \u03b3 B \u0127/2)(+1) ?\n\nWait, H = - \u03b3 B S_y, and S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)(+1) = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, H = - \u03bc \u00b7 B, and \u03bc = \u03b3 S. So H = - \u03b3 B S \u00b7 direction.\n\nWait, when B is along Y, H = - \u03b3 B S_y. So the eigenvalues are E = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)(\u00b11).\n\nWait, but for spin-1/2, S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So H has eigenvalues E_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)(1/2 * 2?) Wait, no. S_y is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y, so when multiplied by -\u03b3 B, the eigenvalues are E_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) (1) = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2.\n\nWait, no, S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so H = - \u03b3 B S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) * (-1). Wait, no: H = - \u03b3 B (S_y).\n\nSo S_y is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y, so H = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. The eigenvalues of \u03c3_y are \u00b11, so the eigenvalues of H are E_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) (1) = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2, and E_- = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of \u03c3_y are \u00b11, so S_y has eigenvalues (\u0127/2)(\u00b11). So H = - \u03b3 B S_y has eigenvalues - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)(\u00b11) \u2192 \u00b1 (- \u03b3 B \u0127/2).\n\nWait, that would make the eigenvalues E_+ = (- \u03b3 B \u0127/2)(-1) = \u03b3 B \u0127/2? No, wait:\n\nWait, S_y has eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2. So H = - \u03b3 B S_y has eigenvalues:\n\nE_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) (+1) = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2.\n\nE_- = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) (-1) = + (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2.\n\nSo the energy levels are E_+ = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2 and E_- = + (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2.\n\nThe initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is an eigenstate of Sz, not Sy. So the initial state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of Sy.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express |+z\u27e9 in terms of the eigenstates of Sy.\n\nThe eigenstates of Sy are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\n|-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSo |+z\u27e9 can be written as (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSo when the Hamiltonian changes to H = - \u03b3 B S_y, the state |+z\u27e9 becomes a superposition of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, which are eigenstates of H with energies E_+ and E_-.\n\nSo the time evolution of each component is multiplied by a phase factor.\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n( e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127 } |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i E_- t / \u0127 } |\u2212y\u27e9 ) / \u221a2.\n\nSubstituting E_+ = - \u03b3 B \u0127 /2 and E_- = \u03b3 B \u0127 /2.\n\nSo:\n\n( e^{-i (- \u03b3 B \u0127 /2 ) t / \u0127 } |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i (\u03b3 B \u0127 /2 ) t / \u0127 } |\u2212y\u27e9 ) / \u221a2.\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nE_+ term: e^{i (\u03b3 B t / 2) }\n\nE_- term: e^{-i (\u03b3 B t / 2) }\n\nSo the state is:\n\n[ e^{i (\u03b3 B t / 2)} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i (\u03b3 B t / 2)} |\u2212y\u27e9 ] / \u221a2.\n\nNow, express this back in terms of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9.\n\nWe know that:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\n|\u2212y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n[ e^{i (\u03b3 B t / 2)} (|+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 + e^{-i (\u03b3 B t / 2)} (|+z\u27e9 - |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] / \u221a2.\n\nFactor out 1/\u221a2:\n\n1/(\u221a2) [ e^{i \u03b8} (|+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9) + e^{-i \u03b8} (|+z\u27e9 - |-z\u27e9) ] / \u221a2,\n\nwhere \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t /2).\n\nSo overall, 1/(\u221a2 * \u221a2) = 1/2.\n\nExpanding the terms:\n\n= [ e^{i \u03b8} |+z\u27e9 + e^{i \u03b8} |-z\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b8} |+z\u27e9 - e^{-i \u03b8} |-z\u27e9 ] / 2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= [ (e^{i \u03b8} + e^{-i \u03b8}) |+z\u27e9 + (e^{i \u03b8} - e^{-i \u03b8}) |-z\u27e9 ] / 2.\n\nUsing Euler's formula:\n\ne^{i \u03b8} + e^{-i \u03b8} = 2 cos\u03b8,\n\ne^{i \u03b8} - e^{-i \u03b8} = 2i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo:\n\n= [ 2 cos\u03b8 |+z\u27e9 + 2i sin\u03b8 |-z\u27e9 ] / 2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos\u03b8 |+z\u27e9 + i sin\u03b8 |-z\u27e9.\n\nSo the state is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = cos\u03b8 |+z\u27e9 + i sin\u03b8 |-z\u27e9.\n\nNow, the expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is (\u0127/2) [\u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3z |\u03c8\u27e9 ].\n\nBut \u03c3z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) [ |cos\u03b8|^2 (1) + |i sin\u03b8|^2 (-1) ].\n\nWait, because |+z\u27e9 has \u03c3z = +1, |-z\u27e9 has \u03c3z = -1.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2\u03b8 * 1 + (i sin\u03b8)(-i sin\u03b8) * (-1) ]\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9 correctly.\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) [ (cos\u03b8)^2 * 1 + (i sin\u03b8)(-i sin\u03b8) * (-1) ) ].\n\nWait, because the state is a sum of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) [ (cos\u03b8)^2 * (+1) + (i sin\u03b8)^2 * (-1) )\n\nWait, no, perhaps a better approach is to compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9 as the expectation value of Sz in the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nSz is (\u0127/2) \u03c3z, which in the computational basis (|+z\u27e9, |-z\u27e9) is diagonal with entries (\u0127/2, -\u0127/2).\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) [ |cos\u03b8|^2 - |i sin\u03b8|^2 ].\n\nBecause |+z\u27e9 contributes (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2\u03b8, and |-z\u27e9 contributes (-\u0127/2) |i sin\u03b8|^2.\n\nWait, |i sin\u03b8|^2 is (sin\u03b8)^2, since |i|^2 is 1.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 ].\n\nWhich is (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8).\n\nSo the same result as before. So this must be correct.\n\nSo, \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8), where \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t)/2.\n\nSo 2\u03b8 = \u03b3 B t.\n\nSo \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t).\n\nBut the magnetic moment's z-component is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz. So:\n\n\u03bc_z(t) = \u03b3 (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t).\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t in the cosine argument, which is \u03b3 B.\n\nWait, but the angular frequency \u03c9 is equal to \u03b3 B. So the frequency f is \u03c9/(2\u03c0) = \u03b3 B/(2\u03c0).\n\nBut the question is about the oscillation frequency, which could be the angular frequency or the regular frequency. The options are given in terms of gamma*B multiplied by a factor, so perhaps the problem is referring to the angular frequency.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma*B. So if the angular frequency is gamma*B, that would match option B.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the oscillation frequency is gamma*B. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, the time dependence is cos(\u03b3 B t), so the argument is gamma B t. So the angular frequency is gamma B, right? Because angular frequency is the coefficient of t in the cosine function.\n\nSo the answer should be gamma*B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have spin precession, the frequency is given by (gamma B)/something. But in this case, the calculation seems to show that the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, let me think about the energy levels again.\n\nThe energy difference between the two eigenstates is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2) - (- gamma B \u0127/2) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe time period for transitions between states would be determined by this energy difference. The frequency of oscillations in expectation values is given by (E_- - E_+)/\u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the angular frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then suddenly switched off and turned on along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis\n\n1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  \n   - Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\\rangle = (1, 0)$ in spinor notation.  \n   - After the field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. In terms of Pauli matrices, $S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$, so $H = -\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$.\n\n2. **Time Evolution**:  \n   - The time evolution operator is $U(t) = \\exp(-iHt/\\hbar) = \\exp\\left(i\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2} \\sigma_y\\right)$.  \n   - Using the expansion $\\exp(i\\theta\\sigma_y) = \\cos(\\theta)I + i\\sin(\\theta)\\sigma_y$, the state evolves as:  \n     \\[\n     |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right)|+z\\rangle + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right)|-z\\rangle.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  \n   - The $z$-component of the spin operator is $S_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$. The expectation value $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ is computed as:  \n     \\[\n     \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right) - \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n     \\]\n\n4. **Magnetic Moment**:  \n   - The $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$. Substituting $\\langle S_z \\rangle$, we find:  \n     \\[\n     \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n     \\]\n\n5. **Oscillation Frequency**:  \n   - The oscillation of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ is governed by the cosine term, which oscillates with angular frequency $\\omega = \\gamma B$.  \n   - Since the problem asks for the oscillation frequency, and the options are expressed in terms of $\\gamma B$, the angular frequency $\\omega = \\gamma B$ corresponds to **Option B**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$. This matches **Option B**.\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe setup is: there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle\u2019s moment after this change.\n\nHmm, right. So, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin of the particle aligns with it. The magnetic moment mu is gamma times the spin component in the direction of the field. So initially, the magnetic field is along Z, so the particle's moment is along Z.\n\nWhen the field is switched to Y, the magnetic field direction changes. Since the field changes suddenly, the state of the particle doesn't change instantaneously. So right after the field change, the spin is still in the same state as before, which is an eigenstate of Sz. But the Hamiltonian changes because the magnetic field direction is now along Y.\n\nWait, the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu\u00b7B. Since mu is gamma Sz, that would make H proportional to Sz. But wait, when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment vector would interact with B in the Y direction. So the correct Hamiltonian should be H = -gamma B S_y, right?\n\nWait, no. Because mu is the magnetic moment vector, which is gamma times the spin vector S. So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the interaction energy is H = -mu \u00b7 B. If B is along Y, then H = -gamma B S_y. So H is proportional to S_y.\n\nWait, but S_y is the spin component along Y. So the Hamiltonian after the field change is H = -gamma B S_y. Hmm, but wait, the sign might not matter for the frequency, just the magnitude.\n\nNow, the initial state of the spin is an eigenstate of Sz. Let's think about the spin-1/2 system. The eigenstates of Sz are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2, respectively. But since the Hamiltonian after the switch is proportional to S_y, which doesn't commute with Sz, the initial state is no longer an eigenstate of H.\n\nSo the system will evolve under this new Hamiltonian. The time evolution of the state will cause transitions between states, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z = gamma <Sz>.\n\nWait, but the oscillation frequency would come from the energy splitting in the system. Let's think about the energy levels. Since the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, which for spin-1/2 has eigenvalues \u00b1(gamma B / 2), perhaps?\n\nWait, spin-1/2 has S_x, S_y, S_z operators. The eigenvalues for S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2, but wait, in our case, the spin matrices are dimensionless, but the units are such that gamma has units of (rad/s per Tesla) or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of energy eigenvalues. The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the energy eigenvalues would be E_+ = (-gamma B) (\u0127/2) and E_- = (+gamma B)(\u0127/2). Wait, no, because S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so H would have eigenvalues E = -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2) * (1/2)? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the factors.\n\nWait, let's clarify. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z have eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So S_y |psi> = (\u00b1 \u0127/2) |psi> for eigenstates. So the Hamiltonian H is H = -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues of H would be E = -gamma B * (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no: H = -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues would be E = -gamma B (s_y), where s_y is \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (1/2?) Wait, no, spin-1/2's eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the eigenvalues of H as being \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2). Because H is proportional to S_y, which has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the energies are E = -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). Wait, that would give E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). But the energy difference between these two levels is E_- - E_+ = gamma B (\u0127/2) - (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nWait, but the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference divided by \u0127, right? Because the energy levels are E_1 and E_2, the transition frequency is (E_2 - E_1)/\u0127. So in this case, (gamma B \u0127)/ \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the oscillation frequency of the expectation value would be related to the energy splitting. Because the state is a superposition of the two eigenstates, leading to oscillations in expectation values with frequency proportional to (E_2 - E_1)/\u0127.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. But H is proportional to S_y, which is off-diagonal in the Sz basis. So the state will precess around the Y-axis. The time evolution will cause transitions between |+z> and |\u2212z> states, leading to oscillations in the expectation value of Sz.\n\nThe frequency of these oscillations is given by the energy difference between the two eigenstates divided by \u0127. The energy difference is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) - (gamma B (\u0127/2)) )= -gamma B \u0127. Wait, but the absolute value is gamma B \u0127. So the frequency is (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The energy eigenvalues are E = \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2), because H is proportional to S_y, which has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energy difference is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2) - (-gamma B \u0127/2) ) = gamma B \u0127. So the frequency is (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. The magnetic moment is mu_z = gamma <Sz>. So when the spin precesses, the expectation value <Sz> oscillates. The frequency of this oscillation would be determined by the energy splitting between the states divided by \u0127.\n\nWait, but wait another point. The Hamiltonian H is H = -gamma B S_y. The time evolution of the state is given by the Schrodinger equation. The time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / \u0127). \n\nThe initial state is |+z>, which is (1,0)^T in the Sz basis. The eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of S_y. Let me call them |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nThe time evolution of the state will cause transitions between |+z> and |-z> because H induces transitions between these states.\n\nThe expectation value of Sz will oscillate with a frequency equal to the energy splitting divided by \u0127. The energy splitting between the two eigenstates is 2*(gamma B \u0127/2) )= gamma B \u0127. So the frequency is (gamma B \u0127)/ \u0127 = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is gamma*B, which would be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait. Another approach: The time dependence of the expectation value can be found using time-dependent perturbation theory, but in this case, it's not a perturbation because the field is suddenly changed. Alternatively, think about the system's Hamiltonian and its eigenstates.\n\nThe spin state precesses around the Y-axis, leading to oscillations in the expectation value of Sz. The Larmor frequency is given by gamma times the magnetic field. But in this case, the field is along Y, so perhaps the frequency is modified.\n\nWait, wait, in a magnetic field along Y, the precession is around Y. The energy levels are split by an amount proportional to B. The frequency of oscillation would be the energy splitting divided by \u0127, which is (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that when the magnetic field is along a direction not aligned with the spin, the transition frequency might involve a factor. Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy levels more carefully.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. The eigenvalues are E = \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2 ), because S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the energy difference is (gamma B \u0127/2 ) - ( - gamma B \u0127/2 ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the frequency is (gamma B \u0127)/ \u0127 = gamma B.

The question says that a particle with spin 1/2 has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and then it's turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes too. Because the magnetic field determines the Hamiltonian, right? So the particle's state will evolve according to the new Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, the magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * Sz. So the magnetic dipole moment is proportional to spin. The energy of a dipole in a magnetic field is U = -mu \u00b7 B. So initially, the magnetic field is along Z, so the Hamiltonian H_initial is proportional to Sz. But after the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian H_final is proportional to Sy, since the field is along Y.\n\nBut wait, when the field is suddenly turned off and another is turned on, what happens? Oh, right, this is a scenario where the system undergoes a sudden change, so the spin state doesn't change instantaneously. The state of the particle remains the same, but the Hamiltonian governing its time evolution changes.\n\nSo the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz.

Let's say it's |+z> for simplicity.\n\nWhen the magnetic field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. So the new Hamiltonian is H = gamma * B * Sy. Because mu is gamma S, and the energy is -mu\u00b7B, but since the magnetic field is in +Y, the energy is proportional to Sy.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the energy is U = -mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, then U = -gamma * S \u00b7 Y. Which would be proportional to Sy.\n\nSo the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. Wait, no, wait: the energy U is -mu \u00b7 B, so the Hamiltonian would be H = -mu \u00b7 B. So mu is gamma S, so H = -gamma B (S \u00b7 B). But since B is along Y, H = -gamma B (Sy). But wait, the sign might depend on how the energy is defined. Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So if mu is gamma Sz, then H = -gamma B Sz when B is along Z. But when B is along Y, H becomes -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the magnetic field is turned off and then another is turned on. So initially, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -gamma B Sz, and then it becomes H_final = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the magnetic field is turned off and another is turned on along Y. So the initial field is B in +Z, then it's turned off (so H_initial is zero?), but no, wait, no. Oh, no, wait. The particle is initially in a magnetic field along Z. Then, the field is turned off (so B becomes zero), and then another field is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -gamma B Sy. Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, and the new B is in Y direction.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is U = -mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, then U = -gamma B Sy. So the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nBut wait, in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -gamma B S \u00b7 n, where n is the direction of the magnetic field. So in our case, after the field is switched, n is along Y. So H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nNow, the initial state of the system is the eigenstate of Sz. Let's say it's |+z>, which has Sz = \u0127/2. So the initial state is |+z>.\n\nAfter the field is switched, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian H = -gamma B Sy. So the time evolution is given by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The state at time t is |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |+z>.\n\nBut we are to find the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is <mu_z>. Since mu = gamma S, then <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.\n\nSo I need to find the expectation value of Sz in the state |psi(t)>, and then multiply by gamma.\n\nLet me write that:\n\n< mu_z(t) > = gamma < psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) >.\n\nBut the state |psi(t)> is the evolved state under H. So let's compute this expectation value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the time dependence of <Sz>.\n\nBut let me think about the energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The new H is proportional to Sy, so its eigenstates are the eigenstates of Sy. Let me denote them as |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2, respectively.\n\nThe initial state |+z> can be expressed as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>. So let me write |+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>.\n\nWhat are the coefficients a and b? I remember that the eigenstates of Sy can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of Sz.\n\nThe |+y> state is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, wait. Let me think: the eigenstates of Sy are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>. Let me write them.\n\nThe eigenstates of Sy are:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nBecause substituting:\n\n(|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) = [ (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) + (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2) \n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n(|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) = [ (|+z> + |-z>) + (|+z> - |-z>) ) ] / (2)\n= [ 2 |+z> ] / 2 \n= |+z>.\n\nYes, correct. So the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, when the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy, the time evolution of each energy eigenstate is multiplied by a phase factor. The energy eigenvalues are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). Because Sy |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = (-gamma B)(\u0127/2) |+y> = E_+ |+y>.\n\nSo the time evolution is:\n\n|psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |+z> \n= exp(-i H t / \u0127) [ (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) ) ]\n= [ exp(-i E_+ t / \u0127) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t / \u0127) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ = (-gamma B \u0127/2 )\nE_- = (gamma B \u0127/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nexp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )\nexp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = [ exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we need to find <Sz> = < psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) >.\n\nSz |+y> and Sz |-y> are known. Let me compute them.\n\nSz |+y> = Sz ( |+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = ( Sz |+z> + Sz |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) ( |+z> - |-z> ) ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) (1/sqrt(2)) (|+z> - |-z> )\n= (\u0127/(2 sqrt(2))) (|+z> - |-z> )\n= (\u0127/(2 sqrt(2))) (sqrt(2) ) | -y > \nWait, because | -y > = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). So,\n\nSz |+y> = (\u0127/2) | -y >.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nSz |-y> = (\u0127/2) |+y> ?\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nSz |-y> = Sz [ (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n= ( Sz |+z> - Sz |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> - (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( \u0127/2 ( |+z> + |-z> ) ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) | +y >.\n\nSo,\n\nSz |+y> = (\u0127/2) | -y > \nSz |-y> = (\u0127/2) |+y> \n\nNow, let's compute <Sz> = < psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) >.\n\nBreaking it down, let's write |psi(t)> as:\n\n[ exp(i a) |+y> + exp(-i a) |-y> ] / sqrt(2), where a = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo,\n\npsi(t) = (e^{i a} |+y> + e^{-i a} |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nThen,\n\n< psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) > = [ (e^{-i a} < +y | + e^{i a} < -y | ) / sqrt(2) ) ] * Sz * [ (e^{i a} |+y> + e^{-i a} |-y> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n\nMultiplying the terms:\n\n= [ (e^{-i a} < +y | + e^{i a} < -y | ) (e^{i a} |+y> + e^{-i a} |-y> ) ] / 2 \n\nExpanding the product inside:\n\n= [ e^{-i a} e^{i a} < +y | +y > + e^{-i a} e^{-i a} < +y | -y > + e^{i a} e^{i a} < -y | +y > + e^{i a} e^{-i a} < -y | -y > ] / 2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n- e^{-i a} e^{i a} = e^0 =1\n- e^{-i a} e^{-i a} = e^{-i 2a}\n- e^{i a} e^{i a} = e^{i 2a}\n- e^{i a} e^{-i a} = e^0 =1\n\nSo,\n\n= [ < +y |+y > + e^{-i 2a} < +y |-y > + e^{i 2a} < -y |+y > + < -y |-y > ] / 2\n\nBut < +y |+y > =1, < -y |-y > =1.\n\nThe cross terms: < +y |-y > =0 because they are orthogonal. Similarly, < -y |+y > =0.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 1 + 1 ] / 2 = 2/2 =1 ?\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the expectation value can't be 1 times \u0127/2. Wait, no, wait. Because the actual computation includes the Sz operator. Oh wait no, I think I made a mistake here because I forgot that Sz |+y> = (\u0127/2) | -y >, so when I compute < +y | Sz |+y >, it's not zero.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct this. Because in the expression above, I incorrectly included the Sz operator. Let me recompute the expectation value correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute < Sz > as follows.\n\nExpress |psi(t)> as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>, then compute <Sz> using the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute <Sz> by expanding the time-evolved state.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value using the expression for |psi(t)>.\n\nSo, let me write |psi(t)> as:\n\n( e^{i a} |+y> + e^{-i a} |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, compute <Sz> = < psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) >.\n\nFirst, compute < psi(t) | Sz = [ e^{-i a} < +y | + e^{i a} < -y | ] / sqrt(2) ) * Sz.\n\nBut Sz |+y> = (\u0127/2) |-y>, and Sz |-y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nSo,\n\n< psi(t) | Sz = [ e^{-i a} < +y | + e^{i a} < -y | ] / sqrt(2) ) * Sz\n= [ e^{-i a} ( < +y | Sz ) + e^{i a} ( < -y | Sz ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= [ e^{-i a} ( (\u0127/2) < +y | -y > ) + e^{i a} ( (\u0127/2) < -y | +y > ) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= [ e^{-i a} ( (\u0127/2) * 0 ) + e^{i a} ( (\u0127/2) * 0 ) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= 0.\n\nWait, that's zero? That can't be right because the expectation value of Sz can't be zero, unless the state is in a state that's symmetric in some way.\n\nWait, but looking back, I think I messed up because Sz is an operator, and when acting on |+y>, it gives (\u0127/2) |-y>. So when I compute < +y | Sz | +y >, it's zero because < +y | Sz | +y > = (\u0127/2) < +y | -y > = 0. Similarly for the other terms.\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because when you compute the expectation value, you have to include the cross terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me compute the expectation value using the expansion.\n\nSo, |psi(t)> is:\n\n( e^{i a} |+y> + e^{-i a} |-y> ) / sqrt(2), where a = gamma B t / 2.\n\nThen, Sz |psi(t)> is:\n\n( e^{i a} Sz |+y> + e^{-i a} Sz |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( e^{i a} (\u0127/2) |-y> + e^{-i a} (\u0127/2) |+y> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) ( e^{i a} |-y> + e^{-i a} |+y> )\n\nSo,\n\n< psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) > is the inner product of |psi(t)> and Sz |psi(t)>.\n\nWhich is:\n\n[ ( e^{-i a} < +y | + e^{i a} < -y | ) / sqrt(2) ) ] * [ ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) ( e^{i a} |-y> + e^{-i a} |+y> ) ) ]\n\n= ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * [ e^{-i a} < +y | + e^{i a} < -y | ] [ e^{i a} |-y> + e^{-i a} |+y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nMultiply the terms inside:\n\n= ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * [ e^{-i a} e^{i a} < +y | -y > + e^{-i a} e^{-i a} < +y | +y > + e^{i a} e^{i a} < -y | -y > + e^{i a} e^{-i a} < -y | +y > ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\ne^{-i a} e^{i a} = 1\ne^{-i a} e^{-i a} = e^{-i 2a}\ne^{i a} e^{i a} = e^{i 2a}\ne^{i a} e^{-i a} =1\n\nSo,\n\n= ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * [ 1*0 + e^{-i 2a} *1 + e^{i 2a} *1 + 1 *0 ] / sqrt(2)\n\nBecause < +y | -y > = 0 and < -y | +y > =0.\n\nSo,\n\n= ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * ( e^{-i 2a} + e^{i 2a} ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * ( 2 cos(2a) ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * 2 cos(2a) / sqrt(2)\nSimplify denominators:\n\nsqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2.\n\nSo,\n\n= ( \u0127/(2 * 2 )) * 2 cos(2a)\n= ( \u0127/4 ) * 2 cos(2a)\n= ( \u0127/2 ) cos(2a )\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz(t) > = ( \u0127/2 ) cos(2a )\n\nBut a is gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz(t) > = ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, because 2a = gamma B t.\n\nWait, because a = (gamma B t ) / 2, so 2a = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz(t) > = ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the question is about <mu_z(t)>, which is gamma times <Sz(t)>, because mu = gamma S.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z(t) > = gamma < Sz(t) > = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but wait, what is the expression for < Sz(t) >? Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, I think I may have made a mistake in the constants.\n\nWait, the spin matrices: for spin 1/2, Sz has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So when I compute < Sz(t) >, it comes out as (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut when I compute the time evolution, the oscillation in <mu_z> would be proportional to cos( ... )\n\nBut the question is about the oscillation frequency. So the argument of the cosine is gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. Because when you have < Sz(t) > oscillating as cos(omega t), the frequency omega is gamma B.\n\nBut let me think about the time evolution. The time evolution is governed by H = -gamma B Sy. The energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nThe time dependence of the state comes from the phase factors exp( -i E t / \u0127 )\n\nSo for |+y>, the phase is exp( i gamma B t / 2 ), and for |-y>, it's exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nWhen you compute <Sz>, you get terms involving e^{i gamma B t} and e^{-i gamma B t}, which combine to form cos( gamma B t )\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is gamma B, option A is gamma B/2, option D is gamma B / sqrt(2), etc.\n\nBut according to the calculation, <mu_z> oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the answer would be option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check because sometimes the frequency might be omega, and sometimes people define frequency as the number of cycles per second, which is omega/(2pi). But in the problem, the question says what is the oscillation frequency, which would be the angular frequency, which is gamma B.\n\nWait, but in our expression, the oscillation is cos( gamma B t ), so the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the correct answer is B) gamma * B.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer might be gamma B /2. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me check the steps.\n\nWait, when I computed <Sz(t)>, I found it to be (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nThen, <mu_z(t)> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nSo the function is cos( gamma B t ), which has angular frequency gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about spin 1/2 particles and magnetic fields. Hmm, let's see. The question says that a particle with spin 1/2 has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and then it's turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes too. Because the magnetic field determines the Hamiltonian, right? So the particle's state will evolve according to the new Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, the magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * Sz. So the magnetic dipole moment is proportional to spin. The energy of a dipole in a magnetic field is U = -mu \u00b7 B. So initially, the magnetic field is along Z, so the Hamiltonian H_initial is proportional to Sz. But after the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian H_final is proportional to Sy, since the field is along Y.\n\nBut wait, when the field is suddenly turned off and another is turned on, what happens? Oh, right, this is a scenario where the system undergoes a sudden change, so the spin state doesn't change instantaneously. The state of the particle remains the same, but the Hamiltonian governing its time evolution changes.\n\nSo the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. Let me think: when the magnetic field is along Z, the particle's spin is aligned along Z. So the state is either |+z> or |-z>. Let's say it's |+z> for simplicity.\n\nWhen the magnetic field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. So the new Hamiltonian is H = gamma * B * Sy. Because mu is gamma S, and the energy is -mu\u00b7B, but since the magnetic field is in +Y, the energy is proportional to Sy.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the energy is U = -mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, then U = -gamma * S \u00b7 Y. Which would be proportional to Sy.\n\nSo the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. Wait, no, wait: the energy U is -mu \u00b7 B, so the Hamiltonian would be H = -mu \u00b7 B. So mu is gamma S, so H = -gamma B (S \u00b7 B). But since B is along Y, H = -gamma B (Sy). But wait, the sign might depend on how the energy is defined. Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So if mu is gamma Sz, then H = -gamma B Sz when B is along Z. But when B is along Y, H becomes -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the magnetic field is turned off and then another is turned on. So initially, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -gamma B Sz, and then it becomes H_final = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the magnetic field is turned off and another is turned on along Y. So the initial field is B in +Z, then it's turned off (so H_initial is zero?), but no, wait, no. Oh, no, wait. The particle is initially in a magnetic field along Z. Then, the field is turned off (so B becomes zero), and then another field is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -gamma B Sy. Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, and the new B is in Y direction.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is U = -mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, then U = -gamma B Sy. So the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nBut wait, in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -gamma B S \u00b7 n, where n is the direction of the magnetic field. So in our case, after the field is switched, n is along Y. So H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nNow, the initial state of the system is the eigenstate of Sz. Let's say it's |+z>, which has Sz = \u0127/2. So the initial state is |+z>.\n\nAfter the field is switched, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian H = -gamma B Sy. So the time evolution is given by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The state at time t is |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |+z>.\n\nBut we are to find the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is <mu_z>. Since mu = gamma S, then <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.\n\nSo I need to find the expectation value of Sz in the state |psi(t)>, and then multiply by gamma.\n\nLet me write that:\n\n< mu_z(t) > = gamma < psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) >.\n\nBut the state |psi(t)> is the evolved state under H. So let's compute this expectation value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the time dependence of <Sz>.\n\nBut let me think about the energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The new H is proportional to Sy, so its eigenstates are the eigenstates of Sy. Let me denote them as |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2, respectively.\n\nThe initial state |+z> can be expressed as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>. So let me write |+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>.\n\nWhat are the coefficients a and b? I remember that the eigenstates of Sy can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of Sz.\n\nThe |+y> state is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, wait. Let me think: the eigenstates of Sy are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>. Let me write them.\n\nThe eigenstates of Sy are:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nBecause substituting:\n\n(|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) = [ (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) + (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2) \n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n(|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) = [ (|+z> + |-z>) + (|+z> - |-z>) ) ] / (2)\n= [ 2 |+z> ] / 2 \n= |+z>.\n\nYes, correct. So the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, when the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy, the time evolution of each energy eigenstate is multiplied by a phase factor. The energy eigenvalues are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). Because Sy |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = (-gamma B)(\u0127/2) |+y> = E_+ |+y>.\n\nSo the time evolution is:\n\n|psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |+z> \n= exp(-i H t / \u0127) [ (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) ) ]\n= [ exp(-i E_+ t / \u0127) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t / \u0127) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ = (-gamma B \u0127/2 )\nE_- = (gamma B \u0127/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nexp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )\nexp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = [ exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we need to find <Sz> = < psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) >.\n\nSz |+y> and Sz |-y> are known. Let me compute them.\n\nSz |+y> = Sz ( |+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = ( Sz |+z> + Sz |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) ( |+z> - |-z> ) ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) (1/sqrt(2)) (|+z> - |-z> )\n= (\u0127/(2 sqrt(2))) (|+z> - |-z> )\n= (\u0127/(2 sqrt(2))) (sqrt(2) ) | -y > \nWait, because | -y > = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). So,\n\nSz |+y> = (\u0127/2) | -y >.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nSz |-y> = (\u0127/2) |+y> ?\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nSz |-y> = Sz [ (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n= ( Sz |+z> - Sz |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> - (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( \u0127/2 ( |+z> + |-z> ) ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) | +y >.\n\nSo,\n\nSz |+y> = (\u0127/2) | -y > \nSz |-y> = (\u0127/2) |+y> \n\nNow, let's compute <Sz> = < psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) >.\n\nBreaking it down, let's write |psi(t)> as:\n\n[ exp(i a) |+y> + exp(-i a) |-y> ] / sqrt(2), where a = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo,\n\npsi(t) = (e^{i a} |+y> + e^{-i a} |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nThen,\n\n< psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) > = [ (e^{-i a} < +y | + e^{i a} < -y | ) / sqrt(2) ) ] * Sz * [ (e^{i a} |+y> + e^{-i a} |-y> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n\nMultiplying the terms:\n\n= [ (e^{-i a} < +y | + e^{i a} < -y | ) (e^{i a} |+y> + e^{-i a} |-y> ) ] / 2 \n\nExpanding the product inside:\n\n= [ e^{-i a} e^{i a} < +y | +y > + e^{-i a} e^{-i a} < +y | -y > + e^{i a} e^{i a} < -y | +y > + e^{i a} e^{-i a} < -y | -y > ] / 2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n- e^{-i a} e^{i a} = e^0 =1\n- e^{-i a} e^{-i a} = e^{-i 2a}\n- e^{i a} e^{i a} = e^{i 2a}\n- e^{i a} e^{-i a} = e^0 =1\n\nSo,\n\n= [ < +y |+y > + e^{-i 2a} < +y |-y > + e^{i 2a} < -y |+y > + < -y |-y > ] / 2\n\nBut < +y |+y > =1, < -y |-y > =1.\n\nThe cross terms: < +y |-y > =0 because they are orthogonal. Similarly, < -y |+y > =0.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 1 + 1 ] / 2 = 2/2 =1 ?\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the expectation value can't be 1 times \u0127/2. Wait, no, wait. Because the actual computation includes the Sz operator. Oh wait no, I think I made a mistake here because I forgot that Sz |+y> = (\u0127/2) | -y >, so when I compute < +y | Sz |+y >, it's not zero.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct this. Because in the expression above, I incorrectly included the Sz operator. Let me recompute the expectation value correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute < Sz > as follows.\n\nExpress |psi(t)> as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>, then compute <Sz> using the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute <Sz> by expanding the time-evolved state.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value using the expression for |psi(t)>.\n\nSo, let me write |psi(t)> as:\n\n( e^{i a} |+y> + e^{-i a} |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, compute <Sz> = < psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) >.\n\nFirst, compute < psi(t) | Sz = [ e^{-i a} < +y | + e^{i a} < -y | ] / sqrt(2) ) * Sz.\n\nBut Sz |+y> = (\u0127/2) |-y>, and Sz |-y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nSo,\n\n< psi(t) | Sz = [ e^{-i a} < +y | + e^{i a} < -y | ] / sqrt(2) ) * Sz\n= [ e^{-i a} ( < +y | Sz ) + e^{i a} ( < -y | Sz ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= [ e^{-i a} ( (\u0127/2) < +y | -y > ) + e^{i a} ( (\u0127/2) < -y | +y > ) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= [ e^{-i a} ( (\u0127/2) * 0 ) + e^{i a} ( (\u0127/2) * 0 ) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= 0.\n\nWait, that's zero? That can't be right because the expectation value of Sz can't be zero, unless the state is in a state that's symmetric in some way.\n\nWait, but looking back, I think I messed up because Sz is an operator, and when acting on |+y>, it gives (\u0127/2) |-y>. So when I compute < +y | Sz | +y >, it's zero because < +y | Sz | +y > = (\u0127/2) < +y | -y > = 0. Similarly for the other terms.\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because when you compute the expectation value, you have to include the cross terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me compute the expectation value using the expansion.\n\nSo, |psi(t)> is:\n\n( e^{i a} |+y> + e^{-i a} |-y> ) / sqrt(2), where a = gamma B t / 2.\n\nThen, Sz |psi(t)> is:\n\n( e^{i a} Sz |+y> + e^{-i a} Sz |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( e^{i a} (\u0127/2) |-y> + e^{-i a} (\u0127/2) |+y> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) ( e^{i a} |-y> + e^{-i a} |+y> )\n\nSo,\n\n< psi(t) | Sz | psi(t) > is the inner product of |psi(t)> and Sz |psi(t)>.\n\nWhich is:\n\n[ ( e^{-i a} < +y | + e^{i a} < -y | ) / sqrt(2) ) ] * [ ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) ( e^{i a} |-y> + e^{-i a} |+y> ) ) ]\n\n= ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * [ e^{-i a} < +y | + e^{i a} < -y | ] [ e^{i a} |-y> + e^{-i a} |+y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nMultiply the terms inside:\n\n= ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * [ e^{-i a} e^{i a} < +y | -y > + e^{-i a} e^{-i a} < +y | +y > + e^{i a} e^{i a} < -y | -y > + e^{i a} e^{-i a} < -y | +y > ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\ne^{-i a} e^{i a} = 1\ne^{-i a} e^{-i a} = e^{-i 2a}\ne^{i a} e^{i a} = e^{i 2a}\ne^{i a} e^{-i a} =1\n\nSo,\n\n= ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * [ 1*0 + e^{-i 2a} *1 + e^{i 2a} *1 + 1 *0 ] / sqrt(2)\n\nBecause < +y | -y > = 0 and < -y | +y > =0.\n\nSo,\n\n= ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * ( e^{-i 2a} + e^{i 2a} ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * ( 2 cos(2a) ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * 2 cos(2a) / sqrt(2)\nSimplify denominators:\n\nsqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2.\n\nSo,\n\n= ( \u0127/(2 * 2 )) * 2 cos(2a)\n= ( \u0127/4 ) * 2 cos(2a)\n= ( \u0127/2 ) cos(2a )\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz(t) > = ( \u0127/2 ) cos(2a )\n\nBut a is gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz(t) > = ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, because 2a = gamma B t.\n\nWait, because a = (gamma B t ) / 2, so 2a = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz(t) > = ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the question is about <mu_z(t)>, which is gamma times <Sz(t)>, because mu = gamma S.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z(t) > = gamma < Sz(t) > = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but wait, what is the expression for < Sz(t) >? Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, I think I may have made a mistake in the constants.\n\nWait, the spin matrices: for spin 1/2, Sz has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So when I compute < Sz(t) >, it comes out as (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut when I compute the time evolution, the oscillation in <mu_z> would be proportional to cos( ... )\n\nBut the question is about the oscillation frequency. So the argument of the cosine is gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. Because when you have < Sz(t) > oscillating as cos(omega t), the frequency omega is gamma B.\n\nBut let me think about the time evolution. The time evolution is governed by H = -gamma B Sy. The energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nThe time dependence of the state comes from the phase factors exp( -i E t / \u0127 )\n\nSo for |+y>, the phase is exp( i gamma B t / 2 ), and for |-y>, it's exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nWhen you compute <Sz>, you get terms involving e^{i gamma B t} and e^{-i gamma B t}, which combine to form cos( gamma B t )\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is gamma B, option A is gamma B/2, option D is gamma B / sqrt(2), etc.\n\nBut according to the calculation, <mu_z> oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the answer would be option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check because sometimes the frequency might be omega, and sometimes people define frequency as the number of cycles per second, which is omega/(2pi). But in the problem, the question says what is the oscillation frequency, which would be the angular frequency, which is gamma B.\n\nWait, but in our expression, the oscillation is cos( gamma B t ), so the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the correct answer is B) gamma * B.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer might be gamma B /2. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me check the steps.\n\nWait, when I computed <Sz(t)>, I found it to be (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nThen, <mu_z(t)> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nSo the function is cos( gamma B t ), which has angular frequency gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\\rangle$, since the magnetic field is initially along $+z$.\n\n2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the magnetic field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the new Hamiltonian becomes:\n   \\[\n   H = -\\gamma B S_y\n   \\]\n   The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\\pm \\hbar/2$, respectively.\n\n3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$:\n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle \\right)\n   \\]\n   Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{i\\gamma B t/2} |+y\\rangle + e^{-i\\gamma B t/2} |-y\\rangle \\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: The $z$-component of the spin operator, $S_z$, acts on the eigenstates of $S_y$ as:\n   \\[\n   S_z |+y\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} |-y\\rangle, \\quad S_z |-y\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} |+y\\rangle\n   \\]\n   Using these relations, the expectation value of $S_z$ in the state $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$ is computed as:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Expectation Value of $\\mu_z$**: Since $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$, the expectation value of $\\mu_z$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)\n   \\]\n   The oscillation frequency of $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$ is determined by the argument of the cosine function, which is $\\gamma B t$. Thus, the angular oscillation frequency is $\\gamma B$.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe question is about a spin 1/2 particle. I remember that spin 1/2 particles are like electrons, right? They have spin angular momentum, and their magnetic moment is related to that spin. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think. So mu = \u03b3 S_z.\n\nInitially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. So the field switches from Z to Y. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nHmm, so I'm supposed to find how the expectation value of the z-component of the spin (or magnetic moment) oscillates over time when the field changes direction from Z to Y. And the options are different expressions involving gamma, B, and some square roots or factors.\n\nWait, I think this has to do with spin precession. When a magnetic field is applied, the spin will precess around the field direction. But wait, in this case, the magnetic field changes direction suddenly. So the initial state is when the field was along Z, and the particle was in an eigenstate of S_z.\n\nLet me think about the initial state. Since the field is along Z, the particle's spin will be aligned with it. So the state is |\u2191\u27e9_z, which is the spin-up state in the z-direction. The magnetic moment is along Z.\n\nNow, the field is turned off, so for an instant, the particle is in a state with no magnetic field. But then another field is turned on along Y. So now the magnetic field is along Y. The magnetic moment will now start to precess around the Y-axis.\n\nWait, but the magnetic moment is given by mu = \u03b3 S, so when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian will be proportional to S_y. Because the energy is -mu \u00b7 B, which becomes proportional to S_y.\n\nSo the Hamiltonian after the field change is H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Wait, or is it positive? Let me get the signs right. The potential energy is U = -\u03bc\u00b7B. So if B is along Y, then \u03bc\u00b7B = \u03bc_y B. So U = -\u03bc_y B. Since \u03bc = \u03b3 S_z, wait no\u2014wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, that might be a bit confusing. Because if mu is along the direction of the spin, but when the field is along Y, the spin component along Y is S_y.\n\nWait, no. The magnetic moment is mu = \u03b3 S. Oh wait, the question says mu = \u03b3 S_z. Hmm, that's a bit different. So the magnetic moment is only in the z-direction. Oh, but that seems odd because when the field is along Y, the spin can have components in Y and Z. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify. The magnetic moment is given by mu = \u03b3 S_z. So mu is a vector whose magnitude is \u03b3 times the z-component of spin. Hmm, that's a bit unusual because usually, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin vector. But perhaps in this problem, mu is specifically along the z-axis, regardless of the spin direction.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a simplification. So regardless of the spin's orientation, mu is along z. But that doesn't make much sense in the presence of a Y-axis field. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mu is the vector product, so mu = \u03b3 S. So mu has components in x, y, z. Because S is a vector operator. That would make more sense because then when the field is along Y, the interaction is with the S_y component.\n\nWait, but the question says mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe problem states: \"mu (= \u03b3*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction.\" Oh, so mu is along Z because the field is along Z. So the magnetic moment is in the same direction as the field. So when the field is along Z, mu is along Z.\n\nThen, the field is turned off, and another field is turned on along Y. So now, the magnetic moment's direction is... well, the problem says mu is aligned with the field. Wait, but if the field is now along Y, then mu would align along Y. But that's probably not the case because the spin state might change. Or wait, maybe the alignment is a result of the field, not the cause.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the situation more accurately. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -\u03b3 B S_z.\n\n2. The eigenstates of H_initial are |\u2191\u27e9 (eigenvalue +\u00bd \u03b3 B) and |\u2193\u27e9 (eigenvalue -\u00bd \u03b3 B).\n\n3. The particle is in a state aligned with the field, which I assume is the eigenstate |\u2191\u27e9, because when the field is along Z, the magnetic moment is along Z and aligned with the field.\n\n4. Then, the field is turned off. So the Hamiltonian becomes zero for an instant. Then, the field is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nWait, but the time when the field is turned off and on is considered instantaneous, so the state doesn't change during that process. So the state right before and right after is the same, which was |\u2191\u27e9_z.\n\nSo after the field is turned on along Y, the system is in state |\u2191\u27e9_z, but the Hamiltonian is now proportional to S_y. So the state will evolve under H_final.\n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is <mu_z>, since mu = gamma S_z. So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.\n\nWait, but if the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, then the average of mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of S_z.\n\nWait, but when the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y, the time evolution will cause the spin to precess around the Y-axis. So the expectation values of S_x, S_y, and S_z will change with time.\n\nBut in this case, since the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9_z, what happens when we apply H = -gamma B S_y?\n\nI think I should use time evolution in quantum mechanics. The time evolution of the state is given by the time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127).\n\nWait, but in this problem, perhaps gamma already incorporates \u0127? Or maybe we can set \u0127 = 1 for simplicity. I'm not sure, but perhaps it's better to proceed without worrying about the constants and see.\n\nSo the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9_z, which can be written in terms of the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, which are superpositions of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nThe initial state |\u2191\u27e9_z can be expressed as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me recall that:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 + i|\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2\n|-y\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 - i|\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nSo solving for |\u2191\u27e9:\n\n|\u2191\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nSo the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nNow, when we apply the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y, the energies are given by the eigenvalues of S_y. The eigenvalues for S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. Wait, S has magnitude \u0127/2, so S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. But wait, wait, S is spin-\u00bd, so S_y |+y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) |+y\u27e9.\n\nSo the energies for the eigenstates |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2), because H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, wait:\n\nH = -gamma B S_y\nSo for |+y\u27e9, H |+y\u27e9 = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y\u27e9\nSimilarly, for |-y\u27e9, H |-y\u27e9 = -gamma B (-\u0127/2) | -y \u27e9 = gamma B (\u0127/2) |-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. The eigenvalue for S_y is (\u0127/2) when in |+y\u27e9, so H |+y\u27e9 = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y\u27e9. Similarly, for |-y\u27e9, S_y gives -\u0127/2, so H |-y\u27e9 = -gamma B (-\u0127/2) |-y\u27e9 = (gamma B \u0127/2) |-y\u27e9.\n\nSo the energies are E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127) / 2 and E_- = (gamma B \u0127) / 2.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should just take \u0127=1 for simplicity, as it's a common practice in such problems. Let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nThe time evolution of each component is given by multiplying each state by a phase factor exp(-i E_n t), where E_n is the energy of the state.\n\nSo after time t, the state becomes:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (e^{-i E_+ t} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i E_- t} |-y\u27e9) / \u221a2\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ = -gamma B (1/2)\nE_- = gamma B (1/2)\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ e^{-i (-gamma B/2) t} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i (gamma B/2) t} |-y\u27e9 ] / \u221a2\n= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y\u27e9 ] / \u221a2\n\nNow, to find the expectation value of S_z, which is the same as gamma^{-1} times the expectation value of mu_z.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the average of the z-component of the moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.\n\nSo I need to compute <S_z> in the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nBut let's compute <S_z> in |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nExpress |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in terms of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, perhaps. Alternatively, compute <S_z> using the expression for |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> directly using the coefficients.\n\nWait, S_z in the basis of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in terms of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 and compute <S_z>.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, express |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 in terms of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9.\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2\n|-y\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nSo substituting into |\u03c8(t)\u27e9:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2 + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] / \u221a2\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9) ) ] / (\u221a2 * \u221a2)\n= [ ( e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) |\u2191\u27e9 + i (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |\u2193\u27e9 ) ] / 2\n\nBecause 1/\u221a2 * 1/\u221a2 is 1/2.\n\nNow, using Euler's formula: e^{i\u03b8} + e^{-i\u03b8} = 2 cos \u03b8, and e^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8} = 2i sin \u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |\u2191\u27e9 + i (2i sin(gamma B t/2)) |\u2193\u27e9 ) ] / 2\n= [ 2 cos(\u03b8) |\u2191\u27e9 + i (2i sin\u03b8) |\u2193\u27e9 ] / 2, where \u03b8 = gamma B t/2.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\ni (2i sin\u03b8) = 2i\u00b2 sin\u03b8 = 2 (-1) sin\u03b8 = -2 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 2 cos\u03b8 |\u2191\u27e9 - 2 sin\u03b8 |\u2193\u27e9 ] / 2\n= cos\u03b8 |\u2191\u27e9 - sin\u03b8 |\u2193\u27e9\n\nSo |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = cos\u03b8 |\u2191\u27e9 - sin\u03b8 |\u2193\u27e9, where \u03b8 = (gamma B t)/2.\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nS_z |\u2191\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) |\u2191\u27e9\nS_z |\u2193\u27e9 = (-\u0127/2) |\u2193\u27e9\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ cos\u03b8 \u27e8\u2191| - sin\u03b8 \u27e8\u2193| ] S_z [ cos\u03b8 |\u2191\u27e9 - sin\u03b8 |\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\n= cos\u03b8 cos\u03b8 \u27e8\u2191| S_z |\u2191\u27e9 + cos\u03b8 (-sin\u03b8) \u27e8\u2191| S_z |\u2193\u27e9 \n+ (-sin\u03b8) cos\u03b8 \u27e8\u2193| S_z |\u2191\u27e9 + (-sin\u03b8)(-sin\u03b8) \u27e8\u2193| S_z |\u2193\u27e9\n\nBut S_z |\u2191\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191| S_z |\u2191\u27e9 = \u0127/2.\n\nSimilarly, \u27e8\u2193| S_z |\u2193\u27e9 = -\u0127/2.\n\nAnd \u27e8\u2191| S_z |\u2193\u27e9 = 0 because S_z is diagonal in the z-basis.\n\nSo the cross terms vanish.\n\nThus,\n\n= cos\u00b2\u03b8 (\u0127/2) + sin\u00b2\u03b8 (-\u0127/2)\n= (\u0127/2)( cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nUsing the double-angle identity, cos(2\u03b8) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8)\n\nBut theta is (gamma B t)/2, so 2 theta is gamma B t.\n\nThus,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t)\n\nWait, but earlier I assumed \u0127=1 for simplicity, but in reality, perhaps the units are such that \u0127 is included in gamma? Hmm, the problem uses gamma, which is the gyromagnetic ratio. The gyromagnetic ratio gamma is usually defined as gamma = (e/(2m)) for a particle with charge e and mass m, but when you include factors of \u0127, it's often expressed as gamma = (e/(2m)) * (1/\u0127) or something similar. But perhaps in this problem, the exact form of gamma already includes \u0127, so that when multiplied by B, it gives a frequency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should not worry about the \u0127 since it's being canceled in the expression. Let's see.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment. So, the expectation value of S_z is oscillating as cos(gamma B t), and hence the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, the expression I have is \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t). But wait, that's not quite right, because I think I may have made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, no, earlier when I substituted theta as (gamma B t)/2, then 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, theta is (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nSo cos(2 theta) = cos(gamma B t).\n\nSo \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nBut wait, the problem defines mu = gamma S_z. So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nWait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle\u2019s moment, which is <mu_z>.\n\nSo <mu_z> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nBut wait, in quantum mechanics, when you have a time dependence like cos(omega t), the frequency is omega. So in this case, the argument of the cosine is gamma B t, which implies that the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the amplitude is (gamma \u0127/2), but the frequency is gamma B. So the average of mu_z oscillates at frequency gamma B.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma B. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, in the time evolution, the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is cos(theta) |\u2191\u27e9 - sin(theta) |\u2193\u27e9, where theta = (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo the expectation value of S_z is (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ] = (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta) = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nSo <mu_z> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nBut wait, if \u0127 is taken as 1, then <mu_z> oscillates at frequency gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the frequency is omega = gamma B. So the correct answer would be option B.\n\nBut let me think again about the initial setup. Initially, the magnetic field is along Z, and the particle is in |\u2191\u27e9_z. Then the field is turned off (so no Hamiltonian for a moment), and then turned on along Y. So the initial state remains |\u2191\u27e9_z, which is not an eigenstate of H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the time evolution will cause the state to precess in the Y-Z plane, leading to oscillations in <S_z> and hence in <mu_z>.\n\nWait, but in the calculation, the frequency is gamma B. But looking at the options, option B is gamma B, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The problem says that the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. So in our calculation, the oscillation is at gamma B.\n\nBut wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment mu is along Y. So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B.\n\nWait, but mu is given as mu = gamma S_z. So when the field is along Y, the dot product is mu_y * B_y = (gamma S_z) * B_y.\n\nWait, that would imply H = -gamma B S_z, but that can't be right because the field is along Y, not Z.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the definition of mu. If mu is given as mu = gamma S, then mu is a vector, and when the field is along Y, the interaction is H = - mu \u00b7 B = -gamma (S \u00b7 B) = -gamma B S_y.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So perhaps the correct expression for mu is a vector, so mu = gamma S, not gamma S_z. Because if mu is along Z when the field is along Z, then it makes sense for mu to be the entire vector.\n\nWait, but the problem states mu = gamma S_z. Hmm. That's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is using mu as the z-component of the magnetic moment. So mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nIn that case, when the field is along Y, the interaction is H = - mu_z B_y (since B is along Y), but that would be zero because B_y is along Y and mu_z is along Z. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, that would imply that when the field is along Y, the interaction is zero, which would mean no oscillation. But the problem says the average starts oscillating, so that can't be.\n\nSo perhaps I must have made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-express the problem correctly.\n\nIf mu is the vector, then mu = gamma S, so when the field is along Y, the interaction is H = - gamma S \u00b7 B = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the correct Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nIn that case, the previous calculation holds, leading to <mu_z> oscillating at frequency gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z. So in that case, when the field is along Y, the interaction would be H = - gamma S_z B_y.\n\nBut B is along Y, so B_y = B. So H = - gamma B S_z.\n\nWait, that's different. So the Hamiltonian would be proportional to S_z again, but the field is along Y.\n\nWait, that would mean the spin is precessing around the Z-axis, which is the original direction. That would imply that the state doesn't change in the Z direction, so the average <S_z> remains constant.\n\nBut the problem states that the average starts oscillating, which would not happen if H is proportional to S_z. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial assumption about mu is incorrect. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nIf mu is the vector, so mu = gamma S, then when the field is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the time evolution would cause the spin to precess around Y, leading to oscillations in <S_z> and hence <mu_z>.\n\nBut if the problem states mu = gamma S_z, then when the field is along Y, the interaction is H = - mu \u00b7 B = - (gamma S_z) (B_y).\n\nWhich is H = - gamma B S_z.\n\nBut then, the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the z-basis, so the state remains |\u2191\u27e9, and there's no oscillation in <S_z>.\n\nBut the problem states that the average starts oscillating, so that can't be right. So perhaps the problem intended that mu is the vector, so mu = gamma S.\n\nIn that case, when the field is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nWhich brings us back to the previous calculation, where <mu_z> oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option B: gamma B.\n\nWait, but looking back, the calculation gave <S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t), so <mu_z> = gamma * <S_z> = gamma (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nBut if we take \u0127=1, then <mu_z> oscillates at frequency gamma B.\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment **\u03bc = \u03b3S_z**, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the +Z direction.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe question is about a spin 1/2 particle. I remember that spin 1/2 particles are like electrons, right? They have spin angular momentum, and their magnetic moment is related to that spin. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think. So mu = \u03b3 S_z.\n\nInitially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. So the field switches from Z to Y. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nHmm, so I'm supposed to find how the expectation value of the z-component of the spin (or magnetic moment) oscillates over time when the field changes direction from Z to Y. And the options are different expressions involving gamma, B, and some square roots or factors.\n\nWait, I think this has to do with spin precession. When a magnetic field is applied, the spin will precess around the field direction. But wait, in this case, the magnetic field changes direction suddenly. So the initial state is when the field was along Z, and the particle was in an eigenstate of S_z.\n\nLet me think about the initial state. Since the field is along Z, the particle's spin will be aligned with it. So the state is |\u2191\u27e9_z, which is the spin-up state in the z-direction. The magnetic moment is along Z.\n\nNow, the field is turned off, so for an instant, the particle is in a state with no magnetic field. But then another field is turned on along Y. So now the magnetic field is along Y. The magnetic moment will now start to precess around the Y-axis.\n\nWait, but the magnetic moment is given by mu = \u03b3 S, so when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian will be proportional to S_y. Because the energy is -mu \u00b7 B, which becomes proportional to S_y.\n\nSo the Hamiltonian after the field change is H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Wait, or is it positive? Let me get the signs right. The potential energy is U = -\u03bc\u00b7B. So if B is along Y, then \u03bc\u00b7B = \u03bc_y B. So U = -\u03bc_y B. Since \u03bc = \u03b3 S_z, wait no\u2014wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, that might be a bit confusing. Because if mu is along the direction of the spin, but when the field is along Y, the spin component along Y is S_y.\n\nWait, no. The magnetic moment is mu = \u03b3 S. Oh wait, the question says mu = \u03b3 S_z. Hmm, that's a bit different. So the magnetic moment is only in the z-direction. Oh, but that seems odd because when the field is along Y, the spin can have components in Y and Z. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify. The magnetic moment is given by mu = \u03b3 S_z. So mu is a vector whose magnitude is \u03b3 times the z-component of spin. Hmm, that's a bit unusual because usually, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin vector. But perhaps in this problem, mu is specifically along the z-axis, regardless of the spin direction.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a simplification. So regardless of the spin's orientation, mu is along z. But that doesn't make much sense in the presence of a Y-axis field. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mu is the vector product, so mu = \u03b3 S. So mu has components in x, y, z. Because S is a vector operator. That would make more sense because then when the field is along Y, the interaction is with the S_y component.\n\nWait, but the question says mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe problem states: \"mu (= \u03b3*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction.\" Oh, so mu is along Z because the field is along Z. So the magnetic moment is in the same direction as the field. So when the field is along Z, mu is along Z.\n\nThen, the field is turned off, and another field is turned on along Y. So now, the magnetic moment's direction is... well, the problem says mu is aligned with the field. Wait, but if the field is now along Y, then mu would align along Y. But that's probably not the case because the spin state might change. Or wait, maybe the alignment is a result of the field, not the cause.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the situation more accurately. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -\u03b3 B S_z.\n\n2. The eigenstates of H_initial are |\u2191\u27e9 (eigenvalue +\u00bd \u03b3 B) and |\u2193\u27e9 (eigenvalue -\u00bd \u03b3 B).\n\n3. The particle is in a state aligned with the field, which I assume is the eigenstate |\u2191\u27e9, because when the field is along Z, the magnetic moment is along Z and aligned with the field.\n\n4. Then, the field is turned off. So the Hamiltonian becomes zero for an instant. Then, the field is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nWait, but the time when the field is turned off and on is considered instantaneous, so the state doesn't change during that process. So the state right before and right after is the same, which was |\u2191\u27e9_z.\n\nSo after the field is turned on along Y, the system is in state |\u2191\u27e9_z, but the Hamiltonian is now proportional to S_y. So the state will evolve under H_final.\n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is <mu_z>, since mu = gamma S_z. So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.\n\nWait, but if the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, then the average of mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of S_z.\n\nWait, but when the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y, the time evolution will cause the spin to precess around the Y-axis. So the expectation values of S_x, S_y, and S_z will change with time.\n\nBut in this case, since the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9_z, what happens when we apply H = -gamma B S_y?\n\nI think I should use time evolution in quantum mechanics. The time evolution of the state is given by the time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127).\n\nWait, but in this problem, perhaps gamma already incorporates \u0127? Or maybe we can set \u0127 = 1 for simplicity. I'm not sure, but perhaps it's better to proceed without worrying about the constants and see.\n\nSo the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9_z, which can be written in terms of the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, which are superpositions of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nThe initial state |\u2191\u27e9_z can be expressed as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me recall that:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 + i|\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2\n|-y\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 - i|\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nSo solving for |\u2191\u27e9:\n\n|\u2191\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nSo the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nNow, when we apply the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y, the energies are given by the eigenvalues of S_y. The eigenvalues for S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. Wait, S has magnitude \u0127/2, so S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. But wait, wait, S is spin-\u00bd, so S_y |+y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) |+y\u27e9.\n\nSo the energies for the eigenstates |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2), because H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, wait:\n\nH = -gamma B S_y\nSo for |+y\u27e9, H |+y\u27e9 = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y\u27e9\nSimilarly, for |-y\u27e9, H |-y\u27e9 = -gamma B (-\u0127/2) | -y \u27e9 = gamma B (\u0127/2) |-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. The eigenvalue for S_y is (\u0127/2) when in |+y\u27e9, so H |+y\u27e9 = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y\u27e9. Similarly, for |-y\u27e9, S_y gives -\u0127/2, so H |-y\u27e9 = -gamma B (-\u0127/2) |-y\u27e9 = (gamma B \u0127/2) |-y\u27e9.\n\nSo the energies are E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127) / 2 and E_- = (gamma B \u0127) / 2.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should just take \u0127=1 for simplicity, as it's a common practice in such problems. Let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nThe time evolution of each component is given by multiplying each state by a phase factor exp(-i E_n t), where E_n is the energy of the state.\n\nSo after time t, the state becomes:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (e^{-i E_+ t} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i E_- t} |-y\u27e9) / \u221a2\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ = -gamma B (1/2)\nE_- = gamma B (1/2)\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ e^{-i (-gamma B/2) t} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i (gamma B/2) t} |-y\u27e9 ] / \u221a2\n= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y\u27e9 ] / \u221a2\n\nNow, to find the expectation value of S_z, which is the same as gamma^{-1} times the expectation value of mu_z.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the average of the z-component of the moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.\n\nSo I need to compute <S_z> in the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nBut let's compute <S_z> in |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nExpress |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in terms of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, perhaps. Alternatively, compute <S_z> using the expression for |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> directly using the coefficients.\n\nWait, S_z in the basis of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in terms of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 and compute <S_z>.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, express |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 in terms of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9.\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2\n|-y\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nSo substituting into |\u03c8(t)\u27e9:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2 + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] / \u221a2\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9) ) ] / (\u221a2 * \u221a2)\n= [ ( e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) |\u2191\u27e9 + i (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |\u2193\u27e9 ) ] / 2\n\nBecause 1/\u221a2 * 1/\u221a2 is 1/2.\n\nNow, using Euler's formula: e^{i\u03b8} + e^{-i\u03b8} = 2 cos \u03b8, and e^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8} = 2i sin \u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |\u2191\u27e9 + i (2i sin(gamma B t/2)) |\u2193\u27e9 ) ] / 2\n= [ 2 cos(\u03b8) |\u2191\u27e9 + i (2i sin\u03b8) |\u2193\u27e9 ] / 2, where \u03b8 = gamma B t/2.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\ni (2i sin\u03b8) = 2i\u00b2 sin\u03b8 = 2 (-1) sin\u03b8 = -2 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 2 cos\u03b8 |\u2191\u27e9 - 2 sin\u03b8 |\u2193\u27e9 ] / 2\n= cos\u03b8 |\u2191\u27e9 - sin\u03b8 |\u2193\u27e9\n\nSo |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = cos\u03b8 |\u2191\u27e9 - sin\u03b8 |\u2193\u27e9, where \u03b8 = (gamma B t)/2.\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nS_z |\u2191\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) |\u2191\u27e9\nS_z |\u2193\u27e9 = (-\u0127/2) |\u2193\u27e9\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ cos\u03b8 \u27e8\u2191| - sin\u03b8 \u27e8\u2193| ] S_z [ cos\u03b8 |\u2191\u27e9 - sin\u03b8 |\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\n= cos\u03b8 cos\u03b8 \u27e8\u2191| S_z |\u2191\u27e9 + cos\u03b8 (-sin\u03b8) \u27e8\u2191| S_z |\u2193\u27e9 \n+ (-sin\u03b8) cos\u03b8 \u27e8\u2193| S_z |\u2191\u27e9 + (-sin\u03b8)(-sin\u03b8) \u27e8\u2193| S_z |\u2193\u27e9\n\nBut S_z |\u2191\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191| S_z |\u2191\u27e9 = \u0127/2.\n\nSimilarly, \u27e8\u2193| S_z |\u2193\u27e9 = -\u0127/2.\n\nAnd \u27e8\u2191| S_z |\u2193\u27e9 = 0 because S_z is diagonal in the z-basis.\n\nSo the cross terms vanish.\n\nThus,\n\n= cos\u00b2\u03b8 (\u0127/2) + sin\u00b2\u03b8 (-\u0127/2)\n= (\u0127/2)( cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nUsing the double-angle identity, cos(2\u03b8) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8)\n\nBut theta is (gamma B t)/2, so 2 theta is gamma B t.\n\nThus,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t)\n\nWait, but earlier I assumed \u0127=1 for simplicity, but in reality, perhaps the units are such that \u0127 is included in gamma? Hmm, the problem uses gamma, which is the gyromagnetic ratio. The gyromagnetic ratio gamma is usually defined as gamma = (e/(2m)) for a particle with charge e and mass m, but when you include factors of \u0127, it's often expressed as gamma = (e/(2m)) * (1/\u0127) or something similar. But perhaps in this problem, the exact form of gamma already includes \u0127, so that when multiplied by B, it gives a frequency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should not worry about the \u0127 since it's being canceled in the expression. Let's see.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment. So, the expectation value of S_z is oscillating as cos(gamma B t), and hence the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, the expression I have is \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t). But wait, that's not quite right, because I think I may have made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, no, earlier when I substituted theta as (gamma B t)/2, then 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, theta is (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nSo cos(2 theta) = cos(gamma B t).\n\nSo \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nBut wait, the problem defines mu = gamma S_z. So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nWait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle\u2019s moment, which is <mu_z>.\n\nSo <mu_z> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nBut wait, in quantum mechanics, when you have a time dependence like cos(omega t), the frequency is omega. So in this case, the argument of the cosine is gamma B t, which implies that the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the amplitude is (gamma \u0127/2), but the frequency is gamma B. So the average of mu_z oscillates at frequency gamma B.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma B. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, in the time evolution, the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is cos(theta) |\u2191\u27e9 - sin(theta) |\u2193\u27e9, where theta = (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo the expectation value of S_z is (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ] = (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta) = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nSo <mu_z> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nBut wait, if \u0127 is taken as 1, then <mu_z> oscillates at frequency gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the frequency is omega = gamma B. So the correct answer would be option B.\n\nBut let me think again about the initial setup. Initially, the magnetic field is along Z, and the particle is in |\u2191\u27e9_z. Then the field is turned off (so no Hamiltonian for a moment), and then turned on along Y. So the initial state remains |\u2191\u27e9_z, which is not an eigenstate of H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the time evolution will cause the state to precess in the Y-Z plane, leading to oscillations in <S_z> and hence in <mu_z>.\n\nWait, but in the calculation, the frequency is gamma B. But looking at the options, option B is gamma B, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The problem says that the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. So in our calculation, the oscillation is at gamma B.\n\nBut wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment mu is along Y. So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B.\n\nWait, but mu is given as mu = gamma S_z. So when the field is along Y, the dot product is mu_y * B_y = (gamma S_z) * B_y.\n\nWait, that would imply H = -gamma B S_z, but that can't be right because the field is along Y, not Z.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the definition of mu. If mu is given as mu = gamma S, then mu is a vector, and when the field is along Y, the interaction is H = - mu \u00b7 B = -gamma (S \u00b7 B) = -gamma B S_y.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So perhaps the correct expression for mu is a vector, so mu = gamma S, not gamma S_z. Because if mu is along Z when the field is along Z, then it makes sense for mu to be the entire vector.\n\nWait, but the problem states mu = gamma S_z. Hmm. That's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is using mu as the z-component of the magnetic moment. So mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nIn that case, when the field is along Y, the interaction is H = - mu_z B_y (since B is along Y), but that would be zero because B_y is along Y and mu_z is along Z. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, that would imply that when the field is along Y, the interaction is zero, which would mean no oscillation. But the problem says the average starts oscillating, so that can't be.\n\nSo perhaps I must have made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-express the problem correctly.\n\nIf mu is the vector, then mu = gamma S, so when the field is along Y, the interaction is H = - gamma S \u00b7 B = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the correct Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nIn that case, the previous calculation holds, leading to <mu_z> oscillating at frequency gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z. So in that case, when the field is along Y, the interaction would be H = - gamma S_z B_y.\n\nBut B is along Y, so B_y = B. So H = - gamma B S_z.\n\nWait, that's different. So the Hamiltonian would be proportional to S_z again, but the field is along Y.\n\nWait, that would mean the spin is precessing around the Z-axis, which is the original direction. That would imply that the state doesn't change in the Z direction, so the average <S_z> remains constant.\n\nBut the problem states that the average starts oscillating, which would not happen if H is proportional to S_z. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial assumption about mu is incorrect. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nIf mu is the vector, so mu = gamma S, then when the field is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the time evolution would cause the spin to precess around Y, leading to oscillations in <S_z> and hence <mu_z>.\n\nBut if the problem states mu = gamma S_z, then when the field is along Y, the interaction is H = - mu \u00b7 B = - (gamma S_z) (B_y).\n\nWhich is H = - gamma B S_z.\n\nBut then, the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the z-basis, so the state remains |\u2191\u27e9, and there's no oscillation in <S_z>.\n\nBut the problem states that the average starts oscillating, so that can't be right. So perhaps the problem intended that mu is the vector, so mu = gamma S.\n\nIn that case, when the field is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nWhich brings us back to the previous calculation, where <mu_z> oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option B: gamma B.\n\nWait, but looking back, the calculation gave <S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t), so <mu_z> = gamma * <S_z> = gamma (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nBut if we take \u0127=1, then <mu_z> oscillates at frequency gamma B.\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment **\u03bc = \u03b3S_z**, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the +Z direction. The field is then switched off and turned on again along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude \\( B \\). The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average \\( \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle \\), the z-component of the magnetic moment.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State**:  \n   When the magnetic field is along +Z, the particle is in the eigenstate \\( | \\uparrow \\rangle_z \\), corresponding to \\( S_z = \\hbar/2 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe problem says the particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is equal to gamma times Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and Sz is the spin component in the z-direction. So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, and the particle's moment is aligned with it. That makes sense because in a magnetic field, the magnetic moment tends to align with the field direction.\n\nThen, suddenly the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude B. Wait, so the magnetic field changes from Z to Y direction. I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which affects the energy levels and the dynamics of the spin.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So, they're asking for the frequency at which <Sz> oscillates after the field change.\n\nI think this involves the concept of precession. When a spin is subjected to a magnetic field, it precesses around the field direction. The Larmor frequency comes into play here, which is the frequency of this precession. The formula for Larmor frequency is omega = gamma * B, right? But wait, that's when the field is along the quantization axis, like Z in this case.\n\nBut in this problem, after the field is turned along Y, the situation changes. Oh wait, when the magnetic field is along Y, the spin will precess around the Y-axis. But how does that affect the expectation value of Sz?\n\nLet me think about the spin states. Before the field change, the particle was in an eigenstate of Sz, let's say |+z> with spin up. When the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -mu \u00b7 B. Wait, mu is gamma Sz, so H = -gamma B (S_y), because B is along Y.\n\nWait, wait. Let me get this straight. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the interaction energy is H = -mu \u00b7 B. So when B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nBut wait, actually, the standard form is H = - gamma B S \u00b7 n, where n is the direction of the magnetic field. So if B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, when you have a spin in a magnetic field along a different axis, the Hamiltonian is proportional to the spin component along that axis. So the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian will be the eigenstates of S_y.\n\nBut the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, which is along Z. So the initial state is |+z> or |\u2212z>?\n\nWait, the initial state is aligned with the magnetic field, which was along Z. So the spin is in the state |+z>, since that's the eigenstate with higher energy (or lower, depending on the sign, but the direction is up).\n\nSo when the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. The initial state is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of S_y. So the state will evolve under this new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / \u0127). But since H is proportional to S_y, which has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 for spin 1/2 (because S_y |\u00b1y> = \u00b1 (\u0127/2) |\u00b1y>).\n\nWait, no. S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, yes. So H = -gamma B S_y, so the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2), because S_y for |+y> is (\u0127/2) and for |\u2212y> is -(\u0127/2). So H |+y> = (-gamma B)(\u0127/2) |+y>, and similarly for |\u2212y>.\n\nBut the initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed as a combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>. Let's write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>.\n\nI recall that the spin states can be transformed between different axes. The |+z> state can be written as (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2). Wait, no. Let me think. The states |+y> and |\u2212y> are orthogonal and form a basis. The |+z> state can be expressed as a superposition of |+y> and |\u2212y>.\n\nThe correct expansion is |+z> = (|+y> + i |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2). Wait, wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of rotation matrices. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the rotation operator to express |+z> in terms of |+y>.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the time evolution. The initial state is |+z>, and the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nThe time evolution will cause the state to evolve as |\u03c8(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |+z>.\n\nLet me compute H. H = -gamma B S_y. The matrix representation of S_y for spin 1/2 is (\u0127/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So H = -gamma B (\u0127/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to work in terms of eigenvalues. The eigenstates of H are |+y> and |\u2212y>, with energies E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nThe initial state |+z> can be written as a linear combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>. Let's find the coefficients.\n\nThe general relation between |+z> and |\u00b1y> is given by the rotation from the z-axis to the y-axis. Alternatively, I can recall that:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2) ? No, wait, maybe with a phase factor. Let me think again.\n\nThe state |+y> is (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2), but that's for a different transformation. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that |+y> is a superposition of |+z> and |\u2212z> with a 90-degree rotation. Wait, perhaps the correct expansion is:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>, we can invert these equations.\n\nLet me write these as:\n\n|+y> = (1/sqrt(2)) |+z> + (i/sqrt(2)) |\u2212z>\n|\u2212y> = (1/sqrt(2)) |+z> - (i/sqrt(2)) |\u2212z>\n\nSo if I add |+y> and |\u2212y>, I get (2/sqrt(2)) |+z>, so |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the phase factors. Let me check:\n\nIf I add the two equations:\n\n|+y> + |\u2212y> = [ (1/sqrt(2) |+z> + i/sqrt(2) |\u2212z) ) + (1/sqrt(2) |+z> - i/sqrt(2) |\u2212z) ) ]\n\n= (2/sqrt(2)) |+z> + 0 |\u2212z>\n\nSo |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the two equations:\n\n|+y> - |\u2212y> = (2 i / sqrt(2)) |\u2212z> \u2192 |\u2212z> = (|+y> - |\u2212y>)/(i sqrt(2)) )\n\nSo, yes, |+z> is (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, applying the time evolution operator:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = exp(-i H t/\u0127) |+z> \n\nSince H is diagonal in the |+y> and |\u2212y> basis, the time evolution of each component can be found easily.\n\nEach component will evolve with a phase factor of exp(-i E_n t/\u0127), where E_n is the energy eigenvalue.\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = (exp(-i E_+ t/\u0127) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t/\u0127) |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nPlugging in E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ = (-gamma B) (\u0127/2)\nE_- = (gamma B) (\u0127/2)\n\nSo,\n\nexp(-i E_+ t/\u0127) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nexp(-i E_- t/\u0127) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ exp(i gamma B t/2) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |\u2212y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we can express this back in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nWait, from earlier, we have |+y> = (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\nand |\u2212y> = (|+z> - i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo substitute these into the expression for |\u03c8(t)>:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ exp(i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2) + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) (|+z> - i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nLet me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from each term:\n\n= [ (1/sqrt(2)) exp(i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + i |\u2212z>) + (1/sqrt(2)) exp(-i gamma B t/2) (|+z> - i |\u2212z>) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))) [ exp(i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + i |\u2212z>) + exp(-i gamma B t/2) (|+z> - i |\u2212z>) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to 1/2 [ ... ]\n\nNow, expand the terms inside:\n\n= (1/2) [ exp(i gamma B t/2) |+z> + i exp(i gamma B t/2) |\u2212z> + exp(-i gamma B t/2) |+z> - i exp(-i gamma B t/2) |\u2212z> ]\n\nGroup the |+z> and |\u2212z> terms:\n\n= (1/2) [ (exp(i gamma B t/2) + exp(-i gamma B t/2)) |+z> + i (exp(i gamma B t/2) - exp(-i gamma B t/2)) |\u2212z> ]\n\nNow, using Euler's formula, exp(i\u03b8) + exp(-i\u03b8) = 2 cos\u03b8, and exp(i\u03b8) - exp(-i\u03b8) = 2i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i (2i sin(gamma B t/2)) |\u2212z> ]\n\nSimplify the coefficients:\n\nThe first term: (1/2)*2 cos(...) = cos(...)\n\nThe second term: (1/2)*i * 2i sin(...) = (i\u00b2) sin(...) \u2192 since i\u00b2 = -1, it's - sin(...)\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> - sin(gamma B t/2) |\u2212z>\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recheck:\n\nWait, the second term after expansion:\n\ni (exp(i\u03b8) - exp(-i\u03b8)) = i*(2i sin\u03b8) )= 2 i\u00b2 sin\u03b8 = -2 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo when I have 1/2 times that, it's (1/2)( -2 sin\u03b8 ) = - sin\u03b8.\n\nSo yes, the |\u2212z> term is - sin(gamma B t/2).\n\nSo, the state |\u03c8(t)> is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = cos( (gamma B t)/2 ) |+z> - sin( (gamma B t)/2 ) |\u2212z>\n\nNow, the magnetic moment in the z-direction is mu_z = gamma <Sz>.\n\nBut since mu = gamma S, and S_z for |+z> is \u0127/2, and for |\u2212z> it's -\u0127/2.\n\nSo, the expectation value of S_z is:\n\n<S_z> = [ cos^2(theta) * (\u0127/2) ) + sin^2(theta) * (-\u0127/2) ) ]\n\nWait, wait, no. Because |\u03c8(t)> is a superposition, so the expectation value is:\n\n<S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\nBut wait, let's compute it more directly.\n\nThe state |\u03c8(t)> is a combination of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = [ cos(theta) ]^2 (\u0127/2) + [ sin(theta) ]^2 (-\u0127/2 )\n\nWhere theta = (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2(theta) - sin\u00b2(theta) ]\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta)\n\nBecause cos(2 theta) = cos\u00b2(theta) - sin\u00b2(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos( 2 * (gamma B t)/2 )\n\nSimplify the argument: 2 * (gamma B t/2 ) = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma <S_z>.\n\nSo,\n\nmu_z = gamma * <S_z> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo,\n\nmu_z = (gamma \u0127 / 2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but what's the angular frequency of the oscillation? The argument of cos is (gamma B) t, so the frequency is omega = gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The standard Larmor frequency is omega_L = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency should be omega_L.\n\nBut looking back, when the magnetic field is along Y, the precession is about Y, which would cause the expectation values of S_x and S_z to oscillate. But in this case, the average of S_z oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the time dependence. The cos(gamma B t) suggests that the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. In the problem statement, mu is given as gamma S_z. So, the oscillation is in <mu_z>, which is gamma <S_z>, which we found to be (gamma \u0127 /2 ) cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the answer should be option B, gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. What if the magnetic field was along Y, but the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So, the energy levels are E_\u00b1 = \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127 / 2 ). The energy difference between the two states is gamma B \u0127. The frequency of oscillations in expectation values is given by the energy difference divided by h-bar, which is gamma B.\n\nSo yes, the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA) gamma*B/2\n\nB) gamma*B\n\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the correct answer is B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. When the field is suddenly switched to point along the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian changes to $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\\rangle$, aligned with the initial magnetic field along $+z$.\n\n2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the field is switched to $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\\pm \\hbar/2$. The corresponding energy eigenvalues are $E_+ = -\\gamma B (\\hbar/2)$ and $E_- = \\gamma B (\\hbar/2)$.\n\n3. **State Evolution**: The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ is not an eigenstate of $S_y$. It can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$:\n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{-iE_+t/\\hbar} |+y\\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\\hbar} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   Substituting $E_+$ and $E_-$, the time-dependent state becomes:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right)|+z\\rangle - \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right)|-z\\rangle.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: The expectation value of $S_z$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right) \\frac{\\hbar}{2} + \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\right).\n   \\]\n   Using $\\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta = \\cos(2\\theta)$, this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n\n5. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ is governed by the argument of the cosine term, $\\cos(\\gamma B t)$. The angular frequency of oscillation is therefore $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n6. **Magnetic Moment Oscillation**: The magnetic moment in the $z$-direction is $\\mu_z = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle$. Substituting $\\langle S_z \\rangle$, we find:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_z = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   The oscillation frequency of $\\mu_z$ is the same as the frequency of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$, which is $\\gamma B$.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s moment is $\\gamma B$. This corresponds to **option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe problem says the particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is equal to gamma times Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and Sz is the spin component in the z-direction. So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, and the particle's moment is aligned with it. That makes sense because in a magnetic field, the magnetic moment tends to align with the field direction.\n\nThen, suddenly the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude B. Wait, so the magnetic field changes from Z to Y direction. I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which affects the energy levels and the dynamics of the spin.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So, they're asking for the frequency at which <Sz> oscillates after the field change.\n\nI think this involves the concept of precession. When a spin is subjected to a magnetic field, it precesses around the field direction. The Larmor frequency comes into play here, which is the frequency of this precession. The formula for Larmor frequency is omega = gamma * B, right? But wait, that's when the field is along the quantization axis, like Z in this case.\n\nBut in this problem, after the field is turned along Y, the situation changes. Oh wait, when the magnetic field is along Y, the spin will precess around the Y-axis. But how does that affect the expectation value of Sz?\n\nLet me think about the spin states. Before the field change, the particle was in an eigenstate of Sz, let's say |+z> with spin up. When the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -mu \u00b7 B. Wait, mu is gamma Sz, so H = -gamma B (S_y), because B is along Y.\n\nWait, wait. Let me get this straight. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the interaction energy is H = -mu \u00b7 B. So when B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nBut wait, actually, the standard form is H = - gamma B S \u00b7 n, where n is the direction of the magnetic field. So if B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, when you have a spin in a magnetic field along a different axis, the Hamiltonian is proportional to the spin component along that axis. So the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian will be the eigenstates of S_y.\n\nBut the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, which is along Z. So the initial state is |+z> or |\u2212z>?\n\nWait, the initial state is aligned with the magnetic field, which was along Z. So the spin is in the state |+z>, since that's the eigenstate with higher energy (or lower, depending on the sign, but the direction is up).\n\nSo when the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. The initial state is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of S_y. So the state will evolve under this new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / \u0127). But since H is proportional to S_y, which has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 for spin 1/2 (because S_y |\u00b1y> = \u00b1 (\u0127/2) |\u00b1y>).\n\nWait, no. S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, yes. So H = -gamma B S_y, so the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2), because S_y for |+y> is (\u0127/2) and for |\u2212y> is -(\u0127/2). So H |+y> = (-gamma B)(\u0127/2) |+y>, and similarly for |\u2212y>.\n\nBut the initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed as a combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>. Let's write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>.\n\nI recall that the spin states can be transformed between different axes. The |+z> state can be written as (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2). Wait, no. Let me think. The states |+y> and |\u2212y> are orthogonal and form a basis. The |+z> state can be expressed as a superposition of |+y> and |\u2212y>.\n\nThe correct expansion is |+z> = (|+y> + i |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2). Wait, wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of rotation matrices. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the rotation operator to express |+z> in terms of |+y>.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the time evolution. The initial state is |+z>, and the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nThe time evolution will cause the state to evolve as |\u03c8(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |+z>.\n\nLet me compute H. H = -gamma B S_y. The matrix representation of S_y for spin 1/2 is (\u0127/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So H = -gamma B (\u0127/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to work in terms of eigenvalues. The eigenstates of H are |+y> and |\u2212y>, with energies E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nThe initial state |+z> can be written as a linear combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>. Let's find the coefficients.\n\nThe general relation between |+z> and |\u00b1y> is given by the rotation from the z-axis to the y-axis. Alternatively, I can recall that:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2) ? No, wait, maybe with a phase factor. Let me think again.\n\nThe state |+y> is (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2), but that's for a different transformation. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that |+y> is a superposition of |+z> and |\u2212z> with a 90-degree rotation. Wait, perhaps the correct expansion is:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> - i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>, we can invert these equations.\n\nLet me write these as:\n\n|+y> = (1/sqrt(2)) |+z> + (i/sqrt(2)) |\u2212z>\n|\u2212y> = (1/sqrt(2)) |+z> - (i/sqrt(2)) |\u2212z>\n\nSo if I add |+y> and |\u2212y>, I get (2/sqrt(2)) |+z>, so |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the phase factors. Let me check:\n\nIf I add the two equations:\n\n|+y> + |\u2212y> = [ (1/sqrt(2) |+z> + i/sqrt(2) |\u2212z) ) + (1/sqrt(2) |+z> - i/sqrt(2) |\u2212z) ) ]\n\n= (2/sqrt(2)) |+z> + 0 |\u2212z>\n\nSo |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the two equations:\n\n|+y> - |\u2212y> = (2 i / sqrt(2)) |\u2212z> \u2192 |\u2212z> = (|+y> - |\u2212y>)/(i sqrt(2)) )\n\nSo, yes, |+z> is (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, applying the time evolution operator:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = exp(-i H t/\u0127) |+z> \n\nSince H is diagonal in the |+y> and |\u2212y> basis, the time evolution of each component can be found easily.\n\nEach component will evolve with a phase factor of exp(-i E_n t/\u0127), where E_n is the energy eigenvalue.\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = (exp(-i E_+ t/\u0127) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t/\u0127) |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nPlugging in E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ = (-gamma B) (\u0127/2)\nE_- = (gamma B) (\u0127/2)\n\nSo,\n\nexp(-i E_+ t/\u0127) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nexp(-i E_- t/\u0127) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ exp(i gamma B t/2) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |\u2212y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we can express this back in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nWait, from earlier, we have |+y> = (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\nand |\u2212y> = (|+z> - i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo substitute these into the expression for |\u03c8(t)>:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ exp(i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2) + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) (|+z> - i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nLet me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from each term:\n\n= [ (1/sqrt(2)) exp(i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + i |\u2212z>) + (1/sqrt(2)) exp(-i gamma B t/2) (|+z> - i |\u2212z>) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))) [ exp(i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + i |\u2212z>) + exp(-i gamma B t/2) (|+z> - i |\u2212z>) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to 1/2 [ ... ]\n\nNow, expand the terms inside:\n\n= (1/2) [ exp(i gamma B t/2) |+z> + i exp(i gamma B t/2) |\u2212z> + exp(-i gamma B t/2) |+z> - i exp(-i gamma B t/2) |\u2212z> ]\n\nGroup the |+z> and |\u2212z> terms:\n\n= (1/2) [ (exp(i gamma B t/2) + exp(-i gamma B t/2)) |+z> + i (exp(i gamma B t/2) - exp(-i gamma B t/2)) |\u2212z> ]\n\nNow, using Euler's formula, exp(i\u03b8) + exp(-i\u03b8) = 2 cos\u03b8, and exp(i\u03b8) - exp(-i\u03b8) = 2i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i (2i sin(gamma B t/2)) |\u2212z> ]\n\nSimplify the coefficients:\n\nThe first term: (1/2)*2 cos(...) = cos(...)\n\nThe second term: (1/2)*i * 2i sin(...) = (i\u00b2) sin(...) \u2192 since i\u00b2 = -1, it's - sin(...)\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> - sin(gamma B t/2) |\u2212z>\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recheck:\n\nWait, the second term after expansion:\n\ni (exp(i\u03b8) - exp(-i\u03b8)) = i*(2i sin\u03b8) )= 2 i\u00b2 sin\u03b8 = -2 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo when I have 1/2 times that, it's (1/2)( -2 sin\u03b8 ) = - sin\u03b8.\n\nSo yes, the |\u2212z> term is - sin(gamma B t/2).\n\nSo, the state |\u03c8(t)> is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = cos( (gamma B t)/2 ) |+z> - sin( (gamma B t)/2 ) |\u2212z>\n\nNow, the magnetic moment in the z-direction is mu_z = gamma <Sz>.\n\nBut since mu = gamma S, and S_z for |+z> is \u0127/2, and for |\u2212z> it's -\u0127/2.\n\nSo, the expectation value of S_z is:\n\n<S_z> = [ cos^2(theta) * (\u0127/2) ) + sin^2(theta) * (-\u0127/2) ) ]\n\nWait, wait, no. Because |\u03c8(t)> is a superposition, so the expectation value is:\n\n<S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\nBut wait, let's compute it more directly.\n\nThe state |\u03c8(t)> is a combination of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = [ cos(theta) ]^2 (\u0127/2) + [ sin(theta) ]^2 (-\u0127/2 )\n\nWhere theta = (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2(theta) - sin\u00b2(theta) ]\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta)\n\nBecause cos(2 theta) = cos\u00b2(theta) - sin\u00b2(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos( 2 * (gamma B t)/2 )\n\nSimplify the argument: 2 * (gamma B t/2 ) = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma <S_z>.\n\nSo,\n\nmu_z = gamma * <S_z> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo,\n\nmu_z = (gamma \u0127 / 2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but what's the angular frequency of the oscillation? The argument of cos is (gamma B) t, so the frequency is omega = gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The standard Larmor frequency is omega_L = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency should be omega_L.\n\nBut looking back, when the magnetic field is along Y, the precession is about Y, which would cause the expectation values of S_x and S_z to oscillate. But in this case, the average of S_z oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the time dependence. The cos(gamma B t) suggests that the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. In the problem statement, mu is given as gamma S_z. So, the oscillation is in <mu_z>, which is gamma <S_z>, which we found to be (gamma \u0127 /2 ) cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the answer should be option B, gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. What if the magnetic field was along Y, but the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So, the energy levels are E_\u00b1 = \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127 / 2 ). The energy difference between the two states is gamma B \u0127. The frequency of oscillations in expectation values is given by the energy difference divided by h-bar, which is gamma B.\n\nSo yes, the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA) gamma*B/2\n\nB) gamma*B\n\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the correct answer is B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. When the field is suddenly switched to point along the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian changes to $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\\rangle$, aligned with the initial magnetic field along $+z$.\n\n2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the field is switched to $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\\pm \\hbar/2$. The corresponding energy eigenvalues are $E_+ = -\\gamma B (\\hbar/2)$ and $E_- = \\gamma B (\\hbar/2)$.\n\n3. **State Evolution**: The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ is not an eigenstate of $S_y$. It can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$:\n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{-iE_+t/\\hbar} |+y\\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\\hbar} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   Substituting $E_+$ and $E_-$, the time-dependent state becomes:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right)|+z\\rangle - \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right)|-z\\rangle.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: The expectation value of $S_z$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right) \\frac{\\hbar}{2} + \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\right).\n   \\]\n   Using $\\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta = \\cos(2\\theta)$, this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n\n5. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ is governed by the argument of the cosine term, $\\cos(\\gamma B t)$. The angular frequency of oscillation is therefore $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n6. **Magnetic Moment Oscillation**: The magnetic moment in the $z$-direction is $\\mu_z = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle$. Substituting $\\langle S_z \\rangle$, we find:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_z = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   The oscillation frequency of $\\mu_z$ is the same as the frequency of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$, which is $\\gamma B$.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s moment is $\\gamma B$. This corresponds to **option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem is about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nHmm, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin of a particle aligns with the field. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, where Sz is the spin in the z-direction. So, mu = \u03b3 S_z. \n\nWait, but when the magnetic field is along Z, the spin will precess around that axis. But when the field is suddenly changed to Y, that must change the Hamiltonian of the system. Oh right, the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since mu is proportional to spin, H should be proportional to the dot product of the spin and the magnetic field.\n\nSo initially, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -\u03b3 B S_z. When the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian becomes zero for an instant, but then the new field along Y makes the new Hamiltonian H_final = -\u03b3 B S_y, because the magnetic field is along Y now.\n\nWait, but the problem says the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. So I'm supposed to find the frequency at which <S_z> oscillates over time.\n\nI think this has to do with the time evolution of the spin state under the new Hamiltonian. Since the initial state was an eigenstate of S_z, but the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, the state will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue \u0127/2. Because the particle is spin-1/2, right? So S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b3 B S_y. Wait, wait. Let me think again. The magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S. So the interaction energy is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since the field is along Y, H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Or wait, wait, because the magnetic field is along +Y, so the vector is (0, B, 0). So the dot product is S_y * B. So H should be -\u03b3 B S_y. Wait, but the sign might not matter for the frequency, but let's keep it correct.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is determined by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The state |\u03c8(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)>, where |\u03c8(0)> is the initial state.\n\nBut since the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, which doesn't commute with S_z, the expectation value of S_z will oscillate over time.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is determined by the energy splitting. For spin-1/2 systems, the energy levels are split by the Hamiltonian. The energy difference between the two eigenstates will give the frequency via E = \u0127\u03c9.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of H are E = \u00b1 (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) * something? Let me think. The operator S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So H = -\u03b3 B S_y. So the eigenvalues of H are E_\u00b1 = -\u03b3 B (\u00b1 \u0127/2 )? Wait, no. Wait, S_y |\u00b1y> = \u00b1 \u0127/2 |\u00b1y>, so H |\u00b1y> = -\u03b3 B S_y |\u00b1y> = -\u03b3 B (\u00b1 \u0127/2) |\u00b1y>. So the energies are E_+ = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and E_- = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Because H is -\u03b3 B S_y. So H |+y> = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) |+y> and H |-y> = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) |-y>.\n\nSo the energy difference between the two eigenstates is E_+ - E_- = [ -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) ) ] - [ \u03b3 B ( \u0127/2 ) ] = - \u03b3 B \u0127. But that can't be right because the energy difference should be positive. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc = \u03b3 S, and B is along Y, then H = - \u03b3 B S_y. So yes, that's correct. So the eigenvalues are E = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and E = + \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). So the energy levels are \u00b1 (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ). The energy difference between them is (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ) - ( - \u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ) ) = \u03b3 B \u0127.\n\nBut wait, the frequency is determined by \u0394E / \u0127. So \u0394E is \u03b3 B \u0127, so \u0394E/\u0127 = \u03b3 B. So the oscillation frequency would be gamma B. But wait, the question is about the oscillation of <S_z>, not the energy. So perhaps I need to consider how the expectation value of S_z changes over time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the frequency is half that. Because when you go from a state that is a superposition of the eigenstates of H, the time evolution leads to oscillations at the frequency corresponding to the energy difference. Since the energy difference is \u03b3 B \u0127, the frequency is (\u03b3 B \u0127) / \u0127 = \u03b3 B.\n\nWait, but wait. The energy difference is 2 * (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ) ) = \u03b3 B \u0127. So the frequency is (\u03b3 B \u0127 ) / \u0127 ) = \u03b3 B. So the oscillation frequency would be gamma B.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option B is gamma*B. So that would be the answer. But wait, am I missing something?\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z>. Let's think about how this state evolves under H = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ) = exp( i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 )\n\nSo the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)> = U |+z> = exp( i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 ) |+z>.\n\nThe spin matrices: S_y is (\u0127/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y |+z> can be found.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to express |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of S_y, which are |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe |+z> state can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nWe know that |+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, when we apply the time evolution under H, which has eigenstates |+y> and |-y>, the state |\u03c8(t)> becomes:\n\nexp( i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 ) * (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2) )\n\nBut since H |+y> = E_+ |+y> and H |-y> = E_- |-y>, the time evolution would be:\n\nexp( i E_+ t / \u0127 ) |+y> + exp( i E_- t / \u0127 ) |-y> ), multiplied by 1/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, no. Because the time evolution is given by H, which is -\u03b3 B S_y, so E_+ is the eigenvalue for |+y>, which is -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2 ), and E_- is \u03b3 B (\u0127/2 ), as we found earlier.\n\nSo the time factors are exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) and exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) because the time evolution operator is exp( -i H t / \u0127 ).\n\nSo substituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nexp( -i (-\u03b3 B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) = exp( i \u03b3 B t / 2 )\n\nSimilarly, for E_-:\n\nexp( -i (\u03b3 B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i \u03b3 B t / 2 )\n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n( exp( i \u03b3 B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i \u03b3 B t / 2 ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, let's write this in terms of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nWe know that |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSubstituting these into the state:\n\n[ exp(i \u03b3 B t/2 ) (|+z> + |-z> )/sqrt(2) + exp( -i \u03b3 B t/2 ) (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nFactor out 1/sqrt(2) from the terms:\n\n= [ ( exp(i \u03b3 B t/2 ) + exp( -i \u03b3 B t/2 ) ) |+z> + ( exp(i \u03b3 B t/2 ) - exp( -i \u03b3 B t/2 ) ) |-z> ) ] / (2)\n\nSimplify the exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\nexp(i\u03b8) + exp(-i\u03b8) = 2 cos\u03b8\n\nexp(i\u03b8) - exp(-i\u03b8) = 2i sin\u03b8\n\nSo substituting:\n\n= [ 2 cos(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |+z> + 2i sin(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |-z> ) ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |-z>\n\nSo the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)> = cos(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |-z>\n\nNow, the average value of S_z is <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\nS_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, and S_z |-z> = (-\u0127/2) |-z>.\n\nCompute <S_z>:\n\n= [ cos(\u03b3 B t/2 )^* < +z | + i sin(\u03b3 B t/2 )^* < -z | ] S_z [ cos(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |-z> ]\n\nSince cos is real and sin is real, their complex conjugates are the same.\n\nSo,\n\n= cos\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2 ) (\u0127/2 ) + i^2 sin\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2 ) (-\u0127/2 )\n\nBut i^2 is -1, so:\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2 ) + sin\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2 ) ]\n\nWait, wait, that would give (\u0127/2)(1) ), which is just \u0127/2, but that can't be right because that would mean <S_z> is constant, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake in calculation. Let me try that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me compute it step by step.\n\n<\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | + i sin(a) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(a) |+z> + i sin(a) |-z> ]\n\nWhere a = \u03b3 B t/2.\n\nSo, expanding this:\n\n= cos(a) < +z | S_z cos(a) |+z> + cos(a) < +z | S_z i sin(a) |-z>\n+ i sin(a) < -z | S_z cos(a) |+z> + i sin(a) < -z | S_z i sin(a) |-z>\n\nNow, S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2)|+z>, so < +z | S_z |+z> = \u0127/2.\n\nS_z |-z> = (-\u0127/2)|-z>, so < +z | S_z |-z> = 0.\n\nSimilarly, < -z | S_z |+z> = 0, and < -z | S_z |-z> = -\u0127/2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n= cos(a) * cos(a) * (\u0127/2) + cos(a) * i sin(a) * 0\n+ i sin(a) * cos(a) * 0 + i sin(a) * i sin(a) * (-\u0127/2 )\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2(a) * \u0127/2\n\nSecond term: 0\n\nThird term: 0\n\nFourth term: (i^2) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2) = (-1) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 ) = (sin\u00b2(a) ) (\u0127/2 )\n\nSo overall:\n\n< S_z > = ( \u0127/2 ) cos\u00b2(a) + ( \u0127/2 ) sin\u00b2(a )\n\n= ( \u0127/2 ) [ cos\u00b2(a) + sin\u00b2(a) ) ]\n\nWhich equals \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem states that the average starts oscillating. So something's wrong here.\n\nAh, I see where I messed up. The state after time t is |\u03c8(t)>, which is a superposition of |+z> and |-z>, but when I compute <S_z>, I'm getting a constant value, which doesn't make sense. That suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of S_z correctly. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion. Let me go back.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the expectation value more carefully. Let's think again.\n\nThe state is |\u03c8(t)> = cos(a)|+z> + i sin(a)|-z>, where a = \u03b3 B t/2.\n\nSo <S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | + i sin(a) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(a)|+z> + i sin(a)|-z> ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm 1: cos(a) < +z | S_z cos(a) |+z> = cos\u00b2(a) (\u0127/2 )\n\nTerm 2: cos(a) < +z | S_z (i sin(a) | -z > ) = cos(a) i sin(a) < +z | S_z | -z > = 0, because S_z | -z > is (-\u0127/2)|-z>, so the inner product is zero.\n\nTerm 3: i sin(a) < -z | S_z cos(a) | +z > = 0, same reason.\n\nTerm 4: i sin(a) < -z | S_z (i sin(a) | -z > ) = i sin(a) * i sin(a) < -z | S_z | -z > \n\n< -z | S_z | -z > = -\u0127/2.\n\nSo term 4 is (i^2) sin^2(a) (-\u0127/2) ) = (-1) sin^2(a) (-\u0127/2) ) = (\u0127/2) sin^2(a)\n\nSo overall, <S_z> = [ \u0127/2 cos^2(a) ] + [ \u0127/2 sin^2(a) ] = \u0127/2 (cos^2(a) + sin^2(a) ) = \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So <S_z> is constant at \u0127/2, but the problem says it starts oscillating. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nHmm, perhaps the mistake is that I assumed the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Wait, no, because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the interaction energy is H = -mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nBut perhaps I should have considered that the Hamiltonian is H = (gamma) B S_y, because sometimes the direction might matter. Let me check.\n\nWait, let's think about the Zeeman term. The energy is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. So if B is along +Y, then H = -mu_y B.\n\nBut mu = gamma S, so mu_y = gamma S_y. Therefore, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but perhaps the sign doesn't affect the frequency since frequency depends on the magnitude of the energy difference. Let me think again about the time evolution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have considered the state in terms of the eigenstates of H. Since H is proportional to S_y, the eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, and the initial state is |+z>, which is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nSo the time evolution would cause each component to pick up a phase factor based on their energy eigenvalues.\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2), as I wrote earlier.\n\nSo the time-evolved state is [ |+y> exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) + |-y> exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nThe energies E_+ and E_- are the eigenvalues of H for |+y> and |-y>.\n\nH = -gamma B S_y, and S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2)|+y>, so H |+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y> \u2192 E_+ = - gamma B \u0127 / 2.\n\nSimilarly, H |-y> = gamma B ( \u0127/2 ) |-y> \u2192 E_- = gamma B \u0127 / 2.\n\nSo the time factors are:\n\nFor |+y>: exp( -i (-gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nFor |-y>: exp( -i (gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n[ |+y> exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) + |-y> exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nExpressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> )/sqrt(2)\n\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> )/sqrt(2)\n\nSo substituting:\n\n= [ (|+z> + |-z> ) exp(i gamma B t/2 ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ] / (2)\n\nFactor out 1/2:\n\n= [ |+z> (exp(i gamma B t/2 ) + exp( -i gamma B t/2 )) + |-z> (exp(i gamma B t/2 ) - exp( -i gamma B t/2 )) ] / 2\n\nNow, using Euler's formula:\n\nexp(i\u03b8) + exp(-i\u03b8) = 2 cos\u03b8\n\nexp(i\u03b8) - exp(-i\u03b8) = 2i sin\u03b8\n\nSo,\n\n= [ |+z> (2 cos( gamma B t/2 )) + |-z> (2i sin( gamma B t/2 )) ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= |+z> cos( gamma B t/2 ) + i |-z> sin( gamma B t/2 )\n\nSo the state is |\u03c8(t)> = cos(a) |+z> + i sin(a) |-z>, where a = gamma B t/2.\n\nNow, compute <S_z>:\n\n<\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | + i sin(a) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(a) |+z> + i sin(a) |-z> ]\n\nExpanding this, the terms are:\n\n1. cos(a) * cos(a) * < +z | S_z |+z> \u2192 cos\u00b2(a) * (\u0127/2)\n\n2. cos(a) * i sin(a) * < +z | S_z |-z> \u2192 0\n\n3. i sin(a) * cos(a) * < -z | S_z |+z> \u2192 0\n\n4. i sin(a) * i sin(a) * < -z | S_z |-z> \u2192 (i\u00b2) sin\u00b2(a) * (-\u0127/2) \u2192 (-1) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 ) = (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(a)\n\nSo adding terms 1 and 4:\n\n< S_z > = (\u0127/2) ( cos\u00b2(a) + sin\u00b2(a) ) = \u0127/2.\n\nBut that's a problem because the question says the average starts oscillating. So my calculation must be wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the signs. Let me check the time evolution again.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S_y, not negative. Because sometimes the magnetic moment is considered positive. Let me think again.\n\nThe magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. The energy is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nBut maybe the convention is that H = - mu \u00b7 B, or perhaps H = mu \u00b7 B. Wait, no, the energy is H = - mu \u00b7 B. Because the magnetic moment tends to align with the field, so lower energy when mu and B are aligned.\n\nWait, but perhaps in the problem statement, mu is given as mu = gamma S_z, but that can't be right because mu is a vector. Oh wait, no, mu is proportional to the spin vector. So mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector (S_x, S_y, S_z).\n\nSo the correct expression for H is H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nBut perhaps I should have used H = gamma B S_y. Let me try that.\n\nWait, if H = gamma B S_y, then the eigenvalues would be E = \u00b1 gamma B (\u0127/2 ), because S_y |\u00b1y> = \u00b1 (\u0127/2) |\u00b1y>.\n\nSo the time evolution would be:\n\nE_+ = gamma B (\u0127/2 )\n\nE_- = - gamma B (\u0127/2 )\n\nSo the time factors would be exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSimilarly, exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ |+y> exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) + |-y> exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nExpressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>, this gives:\n\n= [ (|+z> + |-z> ) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ] / (2)\n\nFactor out 1/2:\n\n= [ |+z> (exp(-i gamma B t/2 ) + exp( i gamma B t/2 )) + |-z> (exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) - exp( i gamma B t/2 )) ] / 2\n\nAgain, using Euler's formula:\n\nexp(i\u03b8) + exp(-i\u03b8) = 2 cos\u03b8\n\nexp(-i\u03b8) - exp(i\u03b8) = -2i sin\u03b8\n\nSo,\n\n= [ |+z> (2 cos(gamma B t/2 )) + |-z> (-2i sin(gamma B t/2 )) ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos(gamma B t/2 ) |+z> - i sin(gamma B t/2 ) |-z>\n\nNow, compute <S_z>:\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | - i sin(a) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(a) |+z> - i sin(a) |-z> ]\n\nWhere a = gamma B t/2.\n\nExpanding:\n\n1. cos(a) * cos(a) < +z | S_z |+z> = cos\u00b2(a) (\u0127/2 )\n\n2. cos(a) * (-i sin(a)) < +z | S_z |-z> \u2192 0\n\n3. (-i sin(a)) cos(a) < -z | S_z |+z> \u2192 0\n\n4. (-i sin(a)) * (-i sin(a)) < -z | S_z |-z> = (i^2) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 ) \u2192 (-1) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 ) = (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(a )\n\nSo <S_z> = (\u0127/2) (cos^2(a) + sin^2(a) ) = \u0127/2.\n\nAgain, same result. So <S_z> remains constant, which contradicts the problem statement. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the initial approach is incorrect. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking about the oscillation of the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component, which is mu_z = gamma <S_z>.\n\nSo the average mu_z = gamma <S_z>.\n\nIf <S_z> is oscillating, then mu_z would oscillate as well.\n\nBut according to my calculations, <S_z> is constant, which can't be right. So where am I going wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion of the state. Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is different. Wait, another thought: when the magnetic field is turned off and then on in the Y direction, the spin starts precessing about Y. The oscillation of <S_z> would come from the spin's precession.\n\nIn the case of spin precession about the Y-axis, the expectation value of S_z would vary sinusoidally. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma times the magnetic field strength.\n\nWait, but wait, the spin is 1/2, so maybe the frequency is half of that.\n\nAlternatively, considering the energy splitting, the frequency is omega = (E_+ - E_- ) / \u0127.\n\nFrom earlier, E_+ = gamma B \u0127 / 2, E_- = - gamma B \u0127 / 2.\n\nSo E_+ - E_- = gamma B \u0127. So omega = (gamma B \u0127 ) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the average of the z-component oscillates. So perhaps the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the average <S_z> is constant, but that must not be correct. So perhaps my mistake was in the calculation. Maybe I should instead compute the expectation value of S_x or S_y, but the problem is about S_z.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the time dependence of the expectation value of S_z.\n\nWait, another approach: the time evolution under H = -gamma B S_y can be considered as a rotation about the Y-axis with angular frequency omega = gamma B.\n\nThe spin state will precess about Y, so the expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally with frequency omega.\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier calculation, the <S_z> was not changing, which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the expectation value of S_z using a different method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the time evolution of the state and compute the expectation value correctly.\n\nWait, let me go back. The state is |\u03c8(t)> = cos(a) |+z> + i sin(a) |-z>, where a = gamma B t/2.\n\nCompute <S_z>:\n\n= <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | + i sin(a) < -z | ] [ cos(a) |+z> + i sin(a) |-z> ] * (\u0127/2) for |+z> and -\u0127/2 for |-z>.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations led me to <S_z> being \u0127/2, which can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the expectation value using the time-dependent state more carefully.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem refers to the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component, mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nIn that case, <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.\n\nIf <S_z> is oscillating, then <mu_z> would also oscillate with the same frequency.\n\nBut according to the earlier calculation, <S_z> is constant, which is not matching the problem statement.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial state is not an eigenstate of H, and thus the expectation value oscillates.\n\nWait, let me think about the time evolution operator. The state |+z> can be written in terms of the eigenstates of H.\n\nThe eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2 ), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2 ).\n\nThe initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> )/ sqrt(2).\n\nSo the time evolution is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = (|+y> exp( -i E_+ t/\u0127 ) + |-y> exp( -i E_- t/\u0127 )) / sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\n= ( |+y> exp( i gamma B t/2 ) + |-y> exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ) / sqrt(2)\n\nExpressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n= [ (|+z> + |-z> ) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ] / (2)\n\nFactor out 1/2:\n\n= [ |+z> ( exp(i gamma B t/2 ) + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ) + |-z> ( exp( i gamma B t/2 ) - exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ) ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula:\n\n= [ |+z> ( 2 cos(gamma B t/2 )) + |-z> ( 2i sin(gamma B t/2 )) ] / 2\n\nSo,\n\n= cos(gamma B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2 ) |-z>\n\nNow, compute <S_z>:\n\n= <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | + i sin(a) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(a) |+z> + i sin(a) |-z> ]\n\nWhere a = gamma B t/2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm 1: cos(a) * cos(a) < +z | S_z |+z> \u2192 cos\u00b2(a) * (\u0127/2)\n\nTerm 2: cos(a) * i sin(a) < +z | S_z |-z> \u2192 0\n\nTerm 3: i sin(a) * cos(a) < -z | S_z |+z> \u2192 0\n\nTerm 4: i sin(a) * i sin(a) < -z | S_z |-z> \u2192 (i\u00b2) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2) \u2192 (-1) * sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 ) = (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(a)\n\nSo overall,\n\n< S_z > = (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2(a) + sin\u00b2(a) ] = \u0127/2.\n\nThis is the same result as before, which is a constant. So that suggests that <S_z> doesn't oscillate, which contradicts the problem statement. But the problem says it does start oscillating. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S_y, without the negative sign.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nH = gamma B S_y.\n\nEigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with E_+ = gamma B (\u0127/2 ), E_- = -gamma B (\u0127/2 )\n\nTime evolution:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = ( |+y> exp( -i E_+ t/\u0127 ) + |-y> exp( -i E_- t/\u0127 ) ) / sqrt(2)\n\n= ( |+y> exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) + |-y> exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ) / sqrt(2)\n\nExpressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n= [ (|+z> + |-z> ) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ] / 2\n\nFactor out 1/2:\n\n= [ |+z> ( exp(-i gamma B t/2 ) + exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ) + |-z> ( exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) - exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ) ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula:\n\n= [ |+z> (2 cos(gamma B t/2 )) + |-z> ( -2i sin(gamma B t/2 ) ) ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos(gamma B t/2 ) |+z> - i sin(gamma B t/2 ) |-z>\n\nNow, compute <S_z>:\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | -i sin(a) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(a) |+z> -i sin(a) |-z> ]\n\nWhere a = gamma B t/2.\n\nExpanding the terms:\n\n1. cos(a) * cos(a) < +z | S_z |+z> \u2192 cos\u00b2(a) (\u0127/2 )\n\n2. cos(a) * (-i sin(a)) < +z | S_z |-z> \u2192 0\n\n3. (-i sin(a)) cos(a) < -z | S_z |+z> \u2192 0\n\n4. (-i sin(a)) * (-i sin(a)) < -z | S_z |-z> \u2192 (i\u00b2) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 ) \u2192 (-1) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 ) = (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(a )\n\nSo <S_z> = (\u0127/2) (cos\u00b2(a) + sin\u00b2(a) ) = \u0127/2.\n\nAgain, same result. So <S_z> is constant, which can't be right. But the problem says it oscillates.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the problem is not about <S_z>, but about the magnetic moment mu_z, which is gamma times S_z. So if <S_z> is constant, then <mu_z> is also constant. But the problem says it oscillates. So I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the oscillation of the expectation value of S_y or S_x. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial state.\n\nWait, maybe the initial state is not |+z> but something else. But the problem states that the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the initial magnetic field along +Z. So the initial state should be |+z>.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of S_y or S_x instead, but the question is about S_z.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the time derivative of <S_z> and see if it's oscillating.\n\nThe time derivative of <S_z> is d/dt <S_z> = (i/\u0127) < [H, S_z] >.\n\nSince H is proportional to S_y, [H, S_z] = [gamma B S_y, S_z] = gamma B [S_y, S_z] = gamma B (i\u0127 S_x )\n\nSo,\n\nd/dt <S_z> = (i/\u0127) gamma B <i \u0127 S_x> = (i/\u0127) gamma B (i \u0127) <S_x> ) = (i^2) gamma B <S_x> ) = (-1) gamma B <S_x> )\n\nSo d/dt <S_z> = - gamma B <S_x>\n\nThis implies that the rate of change of <S_z> depends on <S_x>, which may be oscillating, leading to oscillations in <S_z>.\n\nBut from our earlier calculation, <S_z> is constant, which would imply that <S_x> is zero. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the commutator. Let me recompute [S_y, S_z].\n\nThe commutator [S_y, S_z] is i\u0127 S_x.\n\nYes, because [S_i, S_j] = i\u0127 \u03b5_ijk S_k, where \u03b5 is the Levi-Civita symbol. So [S_y, S_z] = i\u0127 S_x.\n\nSo, [H, S_z] = gamma B [S_y, S_z] = gamma B (i\u0127 S_x )\n\nSo,\n\nd/dt <S_z> = (i/\u0127) < [H, S_z] > = (i/\u0127) gamma B (i \u0127 ) <S_x> ) = (i^2 gamma B ) <S_x> ) = (- gamma B ) <S_x> )\n\nSo if <S_x> is oscillating, then d/dt <S_z> is oscillating, which would imply that <S_z> is a function whose derivative oscillates, leading to <S_z> oscillating.\n\nBut according to our previous calculation, <S_z> is a constant, which suggests that <S_x> is zero.\n\nBut that's not possible because when the spin is precessing around Y, S_x and S_y should be involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute <S_x> and see if it oscillates.\n\nFrom the state |\u03c8(t)> = cos(a)|+z> - i sin(a)|-z>, where a = gamma B t/2.\n\nCompute <S_x>:\n\nS_x = (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nSo,\n\n<\u03c8(t)| S_x |\u03c8(t)> = (\u0127/2) [ cos(a) < +z | + (-i) sin(a) < -z | ] [ cos(a) |+z> - i sin(a) |-z> ]\n\nExpanding:\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos(a) cos(a) < +z | +z > + cos(a) (-i sin(a)) < +z | -z > + (-i sin(a)) cos(a) < -z | +z > + (-i sin(a)) (-i sin(a)) < -z | -z > ]\n\nOnly the first and last terms contribute.\n\nSo,\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2(a) < +z | +z > + (i^2) sin^2(a) < -z | -z > ]\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2(a) (1) + (-1) sin\u00b2(a) (1) ]\n\n= (\u0127/2) ( cos\u00b2(a) - sin\u00b2(a) )\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2a )\n\nSo <S_x> = (\u0127/2) cos( 2 gamma B t )\n\nThus, the time derivative of <S_z> is:\n\nd/dt <S_z> = - gamma B * ( (\u0127/2) cos( 2 gamma B t ) )\n\nBut if <S_z> is a constant, this would imply that d/dt <S_z> is zero. But according to this, d/dt <S_z> is oscillating.\n\nThis contradiction suggests that my earlier calculation of <S_z> being constant must be wrong. So perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute <S_z> again. Let's go back.\n\nThe state is |\u03c8(t)> = cos(a)|+z> - i sin(a)|-z>, where a = gamma B t/2.\n\nCompute <S_z>:\n\n= <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | - i sin(a) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(a)|+z> - i sin(a)|-z> ]\n\n= cos(a) cos(a) < +z | S_z |+z> + cos(a) (-i sin(a)) < +z | S_z |-z> + (-i sin(a)) cos(a) < -z | S_z |+z> + (-i sin(a)) (-i sin(a)) < -z | S_z |-z>\n\nAs before, only terms 1 and 4 contribute:\n\n= cos\u00b2(a) (\u0127/2 ) + (i\u00b2) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 )\n\ni\u00b2 is -1, so:\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2(a) + ( (-1) ) ( - \u0127/2 ) sin\u00b2(a )\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2(a) + (\u0127/2 ) sin\u00b2(a )\n\n= (\u0127/2) (cos\u00b2(a) + sin\u00b2(a)) ) = \u0127/2.\n\nSo <S_z> is indeed constant, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have considered the Hamiltonian without the negative sign. Let me try that.\n\nH = gamma B S_y.\n\nThen, the time evolution operator is exp( -i H t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i gamma B S_y t / \u0127 )\n\nThe state is |\u03c8(t)> = exp( -i gamma B S_y t / \u0127 ) |+z>\n\nBut perhaps I should compute <S_z> using this time evolution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time dependence is such that <S_z> oscillates, but my earlier expansion was incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the oscillation is not in <S_z> but in the magnetic moment mu_z = gamma <S_z>. But that would imply <S_z> is oscillating, which contradicts our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the initial state is not |+z> but some other state. No, the problem says the spin is aligned with the +Z field, so initial state is |+z>.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: The spin precesses about the Y-axis with angular frequency omega = gamma B. The z-component of the spin will oscillate sinusoidally with this frequency.\n\nIn precession, the projection of the spin along the axis of rotation (Y in this case) remains constant, while the projections along the other axes (X and Z) oscillate.\n\nThe average of S_z would oscillate with the same frequency as the precession frequency.\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction.

The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  \n   The initial state is $|+z\\rangle$, an eigenstate of $S_z$.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem is about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nHmm, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin of a particle aligns with the field. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, where Sz is the spin in the z-direction. So, mu = \u03b3 S_z. \n\nWait, but when the magnetic field is along Z, the spin will precess around that axis. But when the field is suddenly changed to Y, that must change the Hamiltonian of the system. Oh right, the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since mu is proportional to spin, H should be proportional to the dot product of the spin and the magnetic field.\n\nSo initially, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -\u03b3 B S_z. When the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian becomes zero for an instant, but then the new field along Y makes the new Hamiltonian H_final = -\u03b3 B S_y, because the magnetic field is along Y now.\n\nWait, but the problem says the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. So I'm supposed to find the frequency at which <S_z> oscillates over time.\n\nI think this has to do with the time evolution of the spin state under the new Hamiltonian. Since the initial state was an eigenstate of S_z, but the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, the state will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue \u0127/2. Because the particle is spin-1/2, right? So S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b3 B S_y. Wait, wait. Let me think again. The magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S. So the interaction energy is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since the field is along Y, H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Or wait, wait, because the magnetic field is along +Y, so the vector is (0, B, 0). So the dot product is S_y * B. So H should be -\u03b3 B S_y. Wait, but the sign might not matter for the frequency, but let's keep it correct.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is determined by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The state |\u03c8(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)>, where |\u03c8(0)> is the initial state.\n\nBut since the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, which doesn't commute with S_z, the expectation value of S_z will oscillate over time.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is determined by the energy splitting. For spin-1/2 systems, the energy levels are split by the Hamiltonian. The energy difference between the two eigenstates will give the frequency via E = \u0127\u03c9.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of H are E = \u00b1 (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) * something? Let me think. The operator S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So H = -\u03b3 B S_y. So the eigenvalues of H are E_\u00b1 = -\u03b3 B (\u00b1 \u0127/2 )? Wait, no. Wait, S_y |\u00b1y> = \u00b1 \u0127/2 |\u00b1y>, so H |\u00b1y> = -\u03b3 B S_y |\u00b1y> = -\u03b3 B (\u00b1 \u0127/2) |\u00b1y>. So the energies are E_+ = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and E_- = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Because H is -\u03b3 B S_y. So H |+y> = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) |+y> and H |-y> = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) |-y>.\n\nSo the energy difference between the two eigenstates is E_+ - E_- = [ -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) ) ] - [ \u03b3 B ( \u0127/2 ) ] = - \u03b3 B \u0127. But that can't be right because the energy difference should be positive. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc = \u03b3 S, and B is along Y, then H = - \u03b3 B S_y. So yes, that's correct. So the eigenvalues are E = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and E = + \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). So the energy levels are \u00b1 (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ). The energy difference between them is (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ) - ( - \u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ) ) = \u03b3 B \u0127.\n\nBut wait, the frequency is determined by \u0394E / \u0127. So \u0394E is \u03b3 B \u0127, so \u0394E/\u0127 = \u03b3 B. So the oscillation frequency would be gamma B. But wait, the question is about the oscillation of <S_z>, not the energy. So perhaps I need to consider how the expectation value of S_z changes over time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the frequency is half that. Because when you go from a state that is a superposition of the eigenstates of H, the time evolution leads to oscillations at the frequency corresponding to the energy difference. Since the energy difference is \u03b3 B \u0127, the frequency is (\u03b3 B \u0127) / \u0127 = \u03b3 B.\n\nWait, but wait. The energy difference is 2 * (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ) ) = \u03b3 B \u0127. So the frequency is (\u03b3 B \u0127 ) / \u0127 ) = \u03b3 B. So the oscillation frequency would be gamma B.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option B is gamma*B. So that would be the answer. But wait, am I missing something?\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z>. Let's think about how this state evolves under H = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ) = exp( i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 )\n\nSo the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)> = U |+z> = exp( i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 ) |+z>.\n\nThe spin matrices: S_y is (\u0127/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y |+z> can be found.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to express |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of S_y, which are |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe |+z> state can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nWe know that |+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, when we apply the time evolution under H, which has eigenstates |+y> and |-y>, the state |\u03c8(t)> becomes:\n\nexp( i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127 ) * (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2) )\n\nBut since H |+y> = E_+ |+y> and H |-y> = E_- |-y>, the time evolution would be:\n\nexp( i E_+ t / \u0127 ) |+y> + exp( i E_- t / \u0127 ) |-y> ), multiplied by 1/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, no. Because the time evolution is given by H, which is -\u03b3 B S_y, so E_+ is the eigenvalue for |+y>, which is -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2 ), and E_- is \u03b3 B (\u0127/2 ), as we found earlier.\n\nSo the time factors are exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) and exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) because the time evolution operator is exp( -i H t / \u0127 ).\n\nSo substituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nexp( -i (-\u03b3 B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) = exp( i \u03b3 B t / 2 )\n\nSimilarly, for E_-:\n\nexp( -i (\u03b3 B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i \u03b3 B t / 2 )\n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n( exp( i \u03b3 B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i \u03b3 B t / 2 ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, let's write this in terms of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nWe know that |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSubstituting these into the state:\n\n[ exp(i \u03b3 B t/2 ) (|+z> + |-z> )/sqrt(2) + exp( -i \u03b3 B t/2 ) (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nFactor out 1/sqrt(2) from the terms:\n\n= [ ( exp(i \u03b3 B t/2 ) + exp( -i \u03b3 B t/2 ) ) |+z> + ( exp(i \u03b3 B t/2 ) - exp( -i \u03b3 B t/2 ) ) |-z> ) ] / (2)\n\nSimplify the exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\nexp(i\u03b8) + exp(-i\u03b8) = 2 cos\u03b8\n\nexp(i\u03b8) - exp(-i\u03b8) = 2i sin\u03b8\n\nSo substituting:\n\n= [ 2 cos(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |+z> + 2i sin(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |-z> ) ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |-z>\n\nSo the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)> = cos(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |-z>\n\nNow, the average value of S_z is <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\nS_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, and S_z |-z> = (-\u0127/2) |-z>.\n\nCompute <S_z>:\n\n= [ cos(\u03b3 B t/2 )^* < +z | + i sin(\u03b3 B t/2 )^* < -z | ] S_z [ cos(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin(\u03b3 B t/2 ) |-z> ]\n\nSince cos is real and sin is real, their complex conjugates are the same.\n\nSo,\n\n= cos\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2 ) (\u0127/2 ) + i^2 sin\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2 ) (-\u0127/2 )\n\nBut i^2 is -1, so:\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2 ) + sin\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2 ) ]\n\nWait, wait, that would give (\u0127/2)(1) ), which is just \u0127/2, but that can't be right because that would mean <S_z> is constant, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake in calculation. Let me try that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me compute it step by step.\n\n<\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | + i sin(a) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(a) |+z> + i sin(a) |-z> ]\n\nWhere a = \u03b3 B t/2.\n\nSo, expanding this:\n\n= cos(a) < +z | S_z cos(a) |+z> + cos(a) < +z | S_z i sin(a) |-z>\n+ i sin(a) < -z | S_z cos(a) |+z> + i sin(a) < -z | S_z i sin(a) |-z>\n\nNow, S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2)|+z>, so < +z | S_z |+z> = \u0127/2.\n\nS_z |-z> = (-\u0127/2)|-z>, so < +z | S_z |-z> = 0.\n\nSimilarly, < -z | S_z |+z> = 0, and < -z | S_z |-z> = -\u0127/2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n= cos(a) * cos(a) * (\u0127/2) + cos(a) * i sin(a) * 0\n+ i sin(a) * cos(a) * 0 + i sin(a) * i sin(a) * (-\u0127/2 )\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2(a) * \u0127/2\n\nSecond term: 0\n\nThird term: 0\n\nFourth term: (i^2) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2) = (-1) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 ) = (sin\u00b2(a) ) (\u0127/2 )\n\nSo overall:\n\n< S_z > = ( \u0127/2 ) cos\u00b2(a) + ( \u0127/2 ) sin\u00b2(a )\n\n= ( \u0127/2 ) [ cos\u00b2(a) + sin\u00b2(a) ) ]\n\nWhich equals \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem states that the average starts oscillating. So something's wrong here.\n\nAh, I see where I messed up. The state after time t is |\u03c8(t)>, which is a superposition of |+z> and |-z>, but when I compute <S_z>, I'm getting a constant value, which doesn't make sense. That suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of S_z correctly. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion. Let me go back.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the expectation value more carefully. Let's think again.\n\nThe state is |\u03c8(t)> = cos(a)|+z> + i sin(a)|-z>, where a = \u03b3 B t/2.\n\nSo <S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | + i sin(a) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(a)|+z> + i sin(a)|-z> ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm 1: cos(a) < +z | S_z cos(a) |+z> = cos\u00b2(a) (\u0127/2 )\n\nTerm 2: cos(a) < +z | S_z (i sin(a) | -z > ) = cos(a) i sin(a) < +z | S_z | -z > = 0, because S_z | -z > is (-\u0127/2)|-z>, so the inner product is zero.\n\nTerm 3: i sin(a) < -z | S_z cos(a) | +z > = 0, same reason.\n\nTerm 4: i sin(a) < -z | S_z (i sin(a) | -z > ) = i sin(a) * i sin(a) < -z | S_z | -z > \n\n< -z | S_z | -z > = -\u0127/2.\n\nSo term 4 is (i^2) sin^2(a) (-\u0127/2) ) = (-1) sin^2(a) (-\u0127/2) ) = (\u0127/2) sin^2(a)\n\nSo overall, <S_z> = [ \u0127/2 cos^2(a) ] + [ \u0127/2 sin^2(a) ] = \u0127/2 (cos^2(a) + sin^2(a) ) = \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So <S_z> is constant at \u0127/2, but the problem says it starts oscillating. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nHmm, perhaps the mistake is that I assumed the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Wait, no, because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the interaction energy is H = -mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nBut perhaps I should have considered that the Hamiltonian is H = (gamma) B S_y, because sometimes the direction might matter. Let me check.\n\nWait, let's think about the Zeeman term. The energy is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. So if B is along +Y, then H = -mu_y B.\n\nBut mu = gamma S, so mu_y = gamma S_y. Therefore, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but perhaps the sign doesn't affect the frequency since frequency depends on the magnitude of the energy difference. Let me think again about the time evolution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have considered the state in terms of the eigenstates of H. Since H is proportional to S_y, the eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, and the initial state is |+z>, which is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nSo the time evolution would cause each component to pick up a phase factor based on their energy eigenvalues.\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2), as I wrote earlier.\n\nSo the time-evolved state is [ |+y> exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) + |-y> exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nThe energies E_+ and E_- are the eigenvalues of H for |+y> and |-y>.\n\nH = -gamma B S_y, and S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2)|+y>, so H |+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y> \u2192 E_+ = - gamma B \u0127 / 2.\n\nSimilarly, H |-y> = gamma B ( \u0127/2 ) |-y> \u2192 E_- = gamma B \u0127 / 2.\n\nSo the time factors are:\n\nFor |+y>: exp( -i (-gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nFor |-y>: exp( -i (gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n[ |+y> exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) + |-y> exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nExpressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> )/sqrt(2)\n\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> )/sqrt(2)\n\nSo substituting:\n\n= [ (|+z> + |-z> ) exp(i gamma B t/2 ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ] / (2)\n\nFactor out 1/2:\n\n= [ |+z> (exp(i gamma B t/2 ) + exp( -i gamma B t/2 )) + |-z> (exp(i gamma B t/2 ) - exp( -i gamma B t/2 )) ] / 2\n\nNow, using Euler's formula:\n\nexp(i\u03b8) + exp(-i\u03b8) = 2 cos\u03b8\n\nexp(i\u03b8) - exp(-i\u03b8) = 2i sin\u03b8\n\nSo,\n\n= [ |+z> (2 cos( gamma B t/2 )) + |-z> (2i sin( gamma B t/2 )) ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= |+z> cos( gamma B t/2 ) + i |-z> sin( gamma B t/2 )\n\nSo the state is |\u03c8(t)> = cos(a) |+z> + i sin(a) |-z>, where a = gamma B t/2.\n\nNow, compute <S_z>:\n\n<\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | + i sin(a) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(a) |+z> + i sin(a) |-z> ]\n\nExpanding this, the terms are:\n\n1. cos(a) * cos(a) * < +z | S_z |+z> \u2192 cos\u00b2(a) * (\u0127/2)\n\n2. cos(a) * i sin(a) * < +z | S_z |-z> \u2192 0\n\n3. i sin(a) * cos(a) * < -z | S_z |+z> \u2192 0\n\n4. i sin(a) * i sin(a) * < -z | S_z |-z> \u2192 (i\u00b2) sin\u00b2(a) * (-\u0127/2) \u2192 (-1) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 ) = (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(a)\n\nSo adding terms 1 and 4:\n\n< S_z > = (\u0127/2) ( cos\u00b2(a) + sin\u00b2(a) ) = \u0127/2.\n\nBut that's a problem because the question says the average starts oscillating. So my calculation must be wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the signs. Let me check the time evolution again.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S_y, not negative. Because sometimes the magnetic moment is considered positive. Let me think again.\n\nThe magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. The energy is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nBut maybe the convention is that H = - mu \u00b7 B, or perhaps H = mu \u00b7 B. Wait, no, the energy is H = - mu \u00b7 B. Because the magnetic moment tends to align with the field, so lower energy when mu and B are aligned.\n\nWait, but perhaps in the problem statement, mu is given as mu = gamma S_z, but that can't be right because mu is a vector. Oh wait, no, mu is proportional to the spin vector. So mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector (S_x, S_y, S_z).\n\nSo the correct expression for H is H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nBut perhaps I should have used H = gamma B S_y. Let me try that.\n\nWait, if H = gamma B S_y, then the eigenvalues would be E = \u00b1 gamma B (\u0127/2 ), because S_y |\u00b1y> = \u00b1 (\u0127/2) |\u00b1y>.\n\nSo the time evolution would be:\n\nE_+ = gamma B (\u0127/2 )\n\nE_- = - gamma B (\u0127/2 )\n\nSo the time factors would be exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSimilarly, exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ |+y> exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) + |-y> exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nExpressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>, this gives:\n\n= [ (|+z> + |-z> ) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ] / (2)\n\nFactor out 1/2:\n\n= [ |+z> (exp(-i gamma B t/2 ) + exp( i gamma B t/2 )) + |-z> (exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) - exp( i gamma B t/2 )) ] / 2\n\nAgain, using Euler's formula:\n\nexp(i\u03b8) + exp(-i\u03b8) = 2 cos\u03b8\n\nexp(-i\u03b8) - exp(i\u03b8) = -2i sin\u03b8\n\nSo,\n\n= [ |+z> (2 cos(gamma B t/2 )) + |-z> (-2i sin(gamma B t/2 )) ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos(gamma B t/2 ) |+z> - i sin(gamma B t/2 ) |-z>\n\nNow, compute <S_z>:\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | - i sin(a) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(a) |+z> - i sin(a) |-z> ]\n\nWhere a = gamma B t/2.\n\nExpanding:\n\n1. cos(a) * cos(a) < +z | S_z |+z> = cos\u00b2(a) (\u0127/2 )\n\n2. cos(a) * (-i sin(a)) < +z | S_z |-z> \u2192 0\n\n3. (-i sin(a)) cos(a) < -z | S_z |+z> \u2192 0\n\n4. (-i sin(a)) * (-i sin(a)) < -z | S_z |-z> = (i^2) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 ) \u2192 (-1) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 ) = (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(a )\n\nSo <S_z> = (\u0127/2) (cos^2(a) + sin^2(a) ) = \u0127/2.\n\nAgain, same result. So <S_z> remains constant, which contradicts the problem statement. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the initial approach is incorrect. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking about the oscillation of the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component, which is mu_z = gamma <S_z>.\n\nSo the average mu_z = gamma <S_z>.\n\nIf <S_z> is oscillating, then mu_z would oscillate as well.\n\nBut according to my calculations, <S_z> is constant, which can't be right. So where am I going wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion of the state. Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is different. Wait, another thought: when the magnetic field is turned off and then on in the Y direction, the spin starts precessing about Y. The oscillation of <S_z> would come from the spin's precession.\n\nIn the case of spin precession about the Y-axis, the expectation value of S_z would vary sinusoidally. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma times the magnetic field strength.\n\nWait, but wait, the spin is 1/2, so maybe the frequency is half of that.\n\nAlternatively, considering the energy splitting, the frequency is omega = (E_+ - E_- ) / \u0127.\n\nFrom earlier, E_+ = gamma B \u0127 / 2, E_- = - gamma B \u0127 / 2.\n\nSo E_+ - E_- = gamma B \u0127. So omega = (gamma B \u0127 ) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the average of the z-component oscillates. So perhaps the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the average <S_z> is constant, but that must not be correct. So perhaps my mistake was in the calculation. Maybe I should instead compute the expectation value of S_x or S_y, but the problem is about S_z.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the time dependence of the expectation value of S_z.\n\nWait, another approach: the time evolution under H = -gamma B S_y can be considered as a rotation about the Y-axis with angular frequency omega = gamma B.\n\nThe spin state will precess about Y, so the expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally with frequency omega.\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier calculation, the <S_z> was not changing, which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the expectation value of S_z using a different method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the time evolution of the state and compute the expectation value correctly.\n\nWait, let me go back. The state is |\u03c8(t)> = cos(a) |+z> + i sin(a) |-z>, where a = gamma B t/2.\n\nCompute <S_z>:\n\n= <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | + i sin(a) < -z | ] [ cos(a) |+z> + i sin(a) |-z> ] * (\u0127/2) for |+z> and -\u0127/2 for |-z>.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations led me to <S_z> being \u0127/2, which can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the expectation value using the time-dependent state more carefully.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem refers to the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component, mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nIn that case, <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.\n\nIf <S_z> is oscillating, then <mu_z> would also oscillate with the same frequency.\n\nBut according to the earlier calculation, <S_z> is constant, which is not matching the problem statement.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial state is not an eigenstate of H, and thus the expectation value oscillates.\n\nWait, let me think about the time evolution operator. The state |+z> can be written in terms of the eigenstates of H.\n\nThe eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2 ), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2 ).\n\nThe initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> )/ sqrt(2).\n\nSo the time evolution is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = (|+y> exp( -i E_+ t/\u0127 ) + |-y> exp( -i E_- t/\u0127 )) / sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\n= ( |+y> exp( i gamma B t/2 ) + |-y> exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ) / sqrt(2)\n\nExpressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n= [ (|+z> + |-z> ) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ] / (2)\n\nFactor out 1/2:\n\n= [ |+z> ( exp(i gamma B t/2 ) + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ) + |-z> ( exp( i gamma B t/2 ) - exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ) ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula:\n\n= [ |+z> ( 2 cos(gamma B t/2 )) + |-z> ( 2i sin(gamma B t/2 )) ] / 2\n\nSo,\n\n= cos(gamma B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2 ) |-z>\n\nNow, compute <S_z>:\n\n= <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | + i sin(a) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(a) |+z> + i sin(a) |-z> ]\n\nWhere a = gamma B t/2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm 1: cos(a) * cos(a) < +z | S_z |+z> \u2192 cos\u00b2(a) * (\u0127/2)\n\nTerm 2: cos(a) * i sin(a) < +z | S_z |-z> \u2192 0\n\nTerm 3: i sin(a) * cos(a) < -z | S_z |+z> \u2192 0\n\nTerm 4: i sin(a) * i sin(a) < -z | S_z |-z> \u2192 (i\u00b2) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2) \u2192 (-1) * sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 ) = (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(a)\n\nSo overall,\n\n< S_z > = (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2(a) + sin\u00b2(a) ] = \u0127/2.\n\nThis is the same result as before, which is a constant. So that suggests that <S_z> doesn't oscillate, which contradicts the problem statement. But the problem says it does start oscillating. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S_y, without the negative sign.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nH = gamma B S_y.\n\nEigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with E_+ = gamma B (\u0127/2 ), E_- = -gamma B (\u0127/2 )\n\nTime evolution:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = ( |+y> exp( -i E_+ t/\u0127 ) + |-y> exp( -i E_- t/\u0127 ) ) / sqrt(2)\n\n= ( |+y> exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) + |-y> exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ) / sqrt(2)\n\nExpressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n= [ (|+z> + |-z> ) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ] / 2\n\nFactor out 1/2:\n\n= [ |+z> ( exp(-i gamma B t/2 ) + exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ) + |-z> ( exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) - exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ) ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula:\n\n= [ |+z> (2 cos(gamma B t/2 )) + |-z> ( -2i sin(gamma B t/2 ) ) ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos(gamma B t/2 ) |+z> - i sin(gamma B t/2 ) |-z>\n\nNow, compute <S_z>:\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | -i sin(a) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(a) |+z> -i sin(a) |-z> ]\n\nWhere a = gamma B t/2.\n\nExpanding the terms:\n\n1. cos(a) * cos(a) < +z | S_z |+z> \u2192 cos\u00b2(a) (\u0127/2 )\n\n2. cos(a) * (-i sin(a)) < +z | S_z |-z> \u2192 0\n\n3. (-i sin(a)) cos(a) < -z | S_z |+z> \u2192 0\n\n4. (-i sin(a)) * (-i sin(a)) < -z | S_z |-z> \u2192 (i\u00b2) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 ) \u2192 (-1) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 ) = (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(a )\n\nSo <S_z> = (\u0127/2) (cos\u00b2(a) + sin\u00b2(a) ) = \u0127/2.\n\nAgain, same result. So <S_z> is constant, which can't be right. But the problem says it oscillates.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the problem is not about <S_z>, but about the magnetic moment mu_z, which is gamma times S_z. So if <S_z> is constant, then <mu_z> is also constant. But the problem says it oscillates. So I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the oscillation of the expectation value of S_y or S_x. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial state.\n\nWait, maybe the initial state is not |+z> but something else. But the problem states that the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the initial magnetic field along +Z. So the initial state should be |+z>.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of S_y or S_x instead, but the question is about S_z.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the time derivative of <S_z> and see if it's oscillating.\n\nThe time derivative of <S_z> is d/dt <S_z> = (i/\u0127) < [H, S_z] >.\n\nSince H is proportional to S_y, [H, S_z] = [gamma B S_y, S_z] = gamma B [S_y, S_z] = gamma B (i\u0127 S_x )\n\nSo,\n\nd/dt <S_z> = (i/\u0127) gamma B <i \u0127 S_x> = (i/\u0127) gamma B (i \u0127) <S_x> ) = (i^2) gamma B <S_x> ) = (-1) gamma B <S_x> )\n\nSo d/dt <S_z> = - gamma B <S_x>\n\nThis implies that the rate of change of <S_z> depends on <S_x>, which may be oscillating, leading to oscillations in <S_z>.\n\nBut from our earlier calculation, <S_z> is constant, which would imply that <S_x> is zero. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the commutator. Let me recompute [S_y, S_z].\n\nThe commutator [S_y, S_z] is i\u0127 S_x.\n\nYes, because [S_i, S_j] = i\u0127 \u03b5_ijk S_k, where \u03b5 is the Levi-Civita symbol. So [S_y, S_z] = i\u0127 S_x.\n\nSo, [H, S_z] = gamma B [S_y, S_z] = gamma B (i\u0127 S_x )\n\nSo,\n\nd/dt <S_z> = (i/\u0127) < [H, S_z] > = (i/\u0127) gamma B (i \u0127 ) <S_x> ) = (i^2 gamma B ) <S_x> ) = (- gamma B ) <S_x> )\n\nSo if <S_x> is oscillating, then d/dt <S_z> is oscillating, which would imply that <S_z> is a function whose derivative oscillates, leading to <S_z> oscillating.\n\nBut according to our previous calculation, <S_z> is a constant, which suggests that <S_x> is zero.\n\nBut that's not possible because when the spin is precessing around Y, S_x and S_y should be involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute <S_x> and see if it oscillates.\n\nFrom the state |\u03c8(t)> = cos(a)|+z> - i sin(a)|-z>, where a = gamma B t/2.\n\nCompute <S_x>:\n\nS_x = (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nSo,\n\n<\u03c8(t)| S_x |\u03c8(t)> = (\u0127/2) [ cos(a) < +z | + (-i) sin(a) < -z | ] [ cos(a) |+z> - i sin(a) |-z> ]\n\nExpanding:\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos(a) cos(a) < +z | +z > + cos(a) (-i sin(a)) < +z | -z > + (-i sin(a)) cos(a) < -z | +z > + (-i sin(a)) (-i sin(a)) < -z | -z > ]\n\nOnly the first and last terms contribute.\n\nSo,\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2(a) < +z | +z > + (i^2) sin^2(a) < -z | -z > ]\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2(a) (1) + (-1) sin\u00b2(a) (1) ]\n\n= (\u0127/2) ( cos\u00b2(a) - sin\u00b2(a) )\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2a )\n\nSo <S_x> = (\u0127/2) cos( 2 gamma B t )\n\nThus, the time derivative of <S_z> is:\n\nd/dt <S_z> = - gamma B * ( (\u0127/2) cos( 2 gamma B t ) )\n\nBut if <S_z> is a constant, this would imply that d/dt <S_z> is zero. But according to this, d/dt <S_z> is oscillating.\n\nThis contradiction suggests that my earlier calculation of <S_z> being constant must be wrong. So perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute <S_z> again. Let's go back.\n\nThe state is |\u03c8(t)> = cos(a)|+z> - i sin(a)|-z>, where a = gamma B t/2.\n\nCompute <S_z>:\n\n= <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>\n\n= [ cos(a) < +z | - i sin(a) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(a)|+z> - i sin(a)|-z> ]\n\n= cos(a) cos(a) < +z | S_z |+z> + cos(a) (-i sin(a)) < +z | S_z |-z> + (-i sin(a)) cos(a) < -z | S_z |+z> + (-i sin(a)) (-i sin(a)) < -z | S_z |-z>\n\nAs before, only terms 1 and 4 contribute:\n\n= cos\u00b2(a) (\u0127/2 ) + (i\u00b2) sin\u00b2(a) (-\u0127/2 )\n\ni\u00b2 is -1, so:\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2(a) + ( (-1) ) ( - \u0127/2 ) sin\u00b2(a )\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2(a) + (\u0127/2 ) sin\u00b2(a )\n\n= (\u0127/2) (cos\u00b2(a) + sin\u00b2(a)) ) = \u0127/2.\n\nSo <S_z> is indeed constant, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have considered the Hamiltonian without the negative sign. Let me try that.\n\nH = gamma B S_y.\n\nThen, the time evolution operator is exp( -i H t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i gamma B S_y t / \u0127 )\n\nThe state is |\u03c8(t)> = exp( -i gamma B S_y t / \u0127 ) |+z>\n\nBut perhaps I should compute <S_z> using this time evolution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time dependence is such that <S_z> oscillates, but my earlier expansion was incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the oscillation is not in <S_z> but in the magnetic moment mu_z = gamma <S_z>. But that would imply <S_z> is oscillating, which contradicts our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the initial state is not |+z> but some other state. No, the problem says the spin is aligned with the +Z field, so initial state is |+z>.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: The spin precesses about the Y-axis with angular frequency omega = gamma B. The z-component of the spin will oscillate sinusoidally with this frequency.\n\nIn precession, the projection of the spin along the axis of rotation (Y in this case) remains constant, while the projections along the other axes (X and Z) oscillate.\n\nThe average of S_z would oscillate with the same frequency as the precession frequency.\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then switched off and reactivated along the $+Y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  \n   The initial state is $|+z\\rangle$, an eigenstate of $S_z$. When the magnetic field is along $+Y$, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\\mu \\cdot B = -\\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $H$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $E_+ = -\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$ and $E_- = \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$.\n\n2. **Time Evolution**:  \n   The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of $H$:  \n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle).\n   \\]\n   Under time evolution, the state becomes:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{-iE_+t/\\hbar} |+y\\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\\hbar} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   Substituting the eigenvalues $E_+$ and $E_-$:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{i\\gamma Bt/2} |+y\\rangle + e^{-i\\gamma Bt/2} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   Expressing $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$ in terms of $|+z\\rangle$ and $|-z\\rangle$:\n   \\[\n   |+y\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+z\\rangle + |-z\\rangle), \\quad |-y\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+z\\rangle - |-z\\rangle),\n   \\]\n   the state becomes:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos(\\gamma Bt/2)|+z\\rangle - i\\sin(\\gamma Bt/2)|-z\\rangle.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  \n   The expectation value of $S_z$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t)| S_z |\\psi(t)\\rangle.\n   \\]\n   Substituting $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$ and using the orthonormality of $|+z\\rangle$ and $|-z\\rangle$, only the diagonal terms contribute:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\cos^2(\\gamma Bt/2)\\langle +z|S_z|+z\\rangle + \\sin^2(\\gamma Bt/2)\\langle -z|S_z|-z\\rangle.\n   \\]\n   Since $\\langle +z|S_z|+z\\rangle = \\hbar/2$ and $\\langle -z|S_z|-z\\rangle = -\\hbar/2$, we find:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left(\\cos^2(\\gamma Bt/2) - \\sin^2(\\gamma Bt/2)\\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma Bt).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  \n   The expectation value $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ oscillates sinusoidally with time, and the oscillation frequency is determined by the argument of the cosine term:\n   \\[\n   f = \\gamma B.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.\n\nThere's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nHmm. I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the field direction. But wait, the initial setup is that the field is along Z. So the particle's spin is aligned with the Z-axis, right? Because mu is along B, so if B is along Z, mu would point in that direction.\n\nWait, but the magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz. Sz is the spin-z operator, which for spin 1/2 has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. But wait, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, right? So mu = gamma * S_z. So the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin component.\n\nNow, the initial state. The particle's spin is aligned with the magnetic field along Z. So the state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's say it's the spin-up state, |\u2191\u27e9, which has S_z = \u0127/2. So mu_z is gamma * (\u0127/2).\n\nThen, the magnetic field is turned off. Oh wait, but does turning off the field mean that the magnetic moment is no longer in a magnetic field? Or does it mean that the Hamiltonian changes? Because in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B. So when B is off, the Hamiltonian is zero? Or maybe the field is turned off and then another field is turned on along Y.\n\nWait, the problem says that the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along Y, same magnitude. So initially, the field was along Z, then it's turned off (so B=0), and then a new B along Y is applied, same magnitude as before. Wait, but the initial B was along Z, same magnitude as the new one along Y. So the initial B was B, and the new B is also B.\n\nWait, but the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Then, the field is turned off, so H becomes zero for a moment. Then, the field is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B, where B is along Y. So H becomes proportional to S_y.\n\nWait, but wait: the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, so when B is along Y, the interaction is mu \u00b7 B = gamma S_z B_y. Because B is along Y, B = (0, B, 0). So the dot product would be gamma S_z * B_y. But wait, S_z is the spin in the z-direction, and B is in Y. So that's gamma * S_z * B.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because if B is along Y, then the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, so the Hamiltonian H would be -mu \u00b7 B = -gamma S_z B (since B is in Y direction, so only the y-component of B is non-zero, but mu is in z, so the dot product is zero? Wait, no, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The magnetic moment is a vector, mu = gamma S, perhaps? Because in the question, it's written as mu = gamma S_z. Wait, the question says mu = gamma S_z, so that's only the z-component of the magnetic moment. Oh, but wait, that would imply that the magnetic moment is only in the z-direction, regardless of the spin direction. That can't be right because the magnetic moment is usually proportional to the spin vector. So maybe the question is written as mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. But the question says mu = gamma S_z, so perhaps it's only the z-component of the magnetic moment? That seems odd because the magnetic dipole moment would depend on the direction of the spin.\n\nWait, maybe I should read the question again. It says, \"magnetic moment mu (= gamma * S_z)\", which suggests that mu is the z-component of the magnetic moment. Or perhaps mu is a vector, and mu_z is gamma S_z. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma S, so the vector. So when the field is in the z direction, the energy is proportional to S_z. But when the field is turned to y, the energy becomes proportional to S_y.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that mu is the z-component of the magnetic moment. So, when the magnetic field is along y, the interaction energy is mu * B, but mu is along z, and B is along y. So their dot product would be zero, meaning no energy. That can't be right, because then the Hamiltonian would be zero, and there would be no oscillations. But the question says that the average z-component of the moment oscillates. So perhaps I misunderstood the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps mu is the vector magnetic moment. So mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. So when the field is along Z, the magnetic moment is aligned along Z, and when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment will precess around Y. So the expectation value of S_z will oscillate.\n\nLet me think about the time evolution. So initially, the spin is in the eigenstate of S_z, say |\u2191\u27e9. Then, when the magnetic field is turned off, the Hamiltonian is zero for a moment. Then, the field is turned on along Y, so H becomes proportional to S_y.\n\nWait, but when you change the Hamiltonian, the state doesn't change immediately. The state will evolve under the new Hamiltonian. So the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9, which is an eigenstate of S_z, but not of S_y.\n\nSo the time evolution is governed by H = - gamma B S_y (since mu = gamma S, and B is along Y, so H = - mu \u00b7 B = - gamma S \u00b7 B = -gamma B S_y).\n\nSo H = - gamma B S_y. But wait, in terms of units, the Hamiltonian should have units of energy. Let me make sure: S has units of \u0127, and gamma is (rad/s/T), I think. So B is in Tesla, and gamma*B has units of (rad/s), which makes sense for the Larmor frequency.\n\nWait, but the actual expression for H would be H = -gamma B S_y. Because S has units of \u0127, so gamma B S would have units of (rad/s) * (dimensionless) * \u0127. Hmm, perhaps I should be careful about the actual expression.\n\nBut regardless, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). So substituting H, we get U(t) = exp( i gamma B S_y t / \u0127 ). Wait, because H is negative, so the exponent is positive? Let me double-check: H = - gamma B S_y, so H t / \u0127 is (- gamma B S_y t)/ \u0127. So the exponent is -i H t / \u0127 = i gamma B S_y t / \u0127.\n\nNow, S_y is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli Y matrix. So S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. Therefore, H = - gamma B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. So substituting back into U(t):\n\nU(t) = exp( i gamma B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y t / \u0127 )\n\nSimplify: the \u0127 in numerator and denominator cancels, so:\n\nU(t) = exp( i (gamma B / 2) \u03c3_y t )\n\nBut the Pauli matrices are 2x2, so when exponentiating, we can use the identity for exponential of Pauli matrices. The exponential of i \u03b8 \u03c3 \u00b7 n is cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n), for a unit vector n.\n\nIn this case, the exponent is i (gamma B t / 2) \u03c3_y. So \u03b8 is (gamma B t / 2), and n is the y direction. So:\n\nU(t) = cos( gamma B t / 2 ) I + i sin( gamma B t / 2 ) \u03c3_y\n\nSo the time evolution operator is this matrix.\n\nNow, the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9, which is (1, 0)^T. Let's compute the state at time t: |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t) |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nCompute U(t) |\u2191\u27e9:\n\nLet me write U(t) as:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3_y ] acting on |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nBut wait, \u03c3_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So:\n\nU(t) = cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,1]] + i sin\u03b8 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nWhich is:\n\ncos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,1]] + i sin\u03b8 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\n= [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, cos\u03b8]] + [[0, -i^2 sin\u03b8], [i^2 sin\u03b8, 0]]\n\nWait, wait: Let's compute each element.\n\nTop left: cos\u03b8 * 1 + i sin\u03b8 * 0 = cos\u03b8.\n\nTop right: cos\u03b8 * 0 + i sin\u03b8 * (-i) = i*(-i) sin\u03b8 = (-i^2) sin\u03b8 = (1) sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, because i*(-i) is -i^2 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, bottom left: cos\u03b8 *0 + i sin\u03b8 * i = i^2 sin\u03b8 = - sin\u03b8.\n\nBottom right: cos\u03b8 *1 + i sin\u03b8 *0 = cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, so U(t) becomes:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [-sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8] ]\n\nWait, but I'm getting this because \u03c3_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]], so when multiplied by i sin\u03b8:\n\ni sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_y = [[0, -i^2 sin\u03b8], [i^2 sin\u03b8, 0]] = [[0, sin\u03b8], [-sin\u03b8, 0]]\n\nSo adding cos\u03b8 I:\n\nU(t) = [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [-sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8]]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo when we apply U(t) to |\u2191\u27e9 = [1, 0]^T, we get:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 * 1 + sin\u03b8 * 0,\n  -sin\u03b8 * 1 + cos\u03b8 * 0 ]\n\n= [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the state is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ]^T, where \u03b8 = gamma B t / 2.\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nS_z for spin 1/2 is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z = (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nSo let's compute \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nCompute this:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| \u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ] [[1,0],[0,-1]] [ cos\u03b8; -sin\u03b8 ]\n\nMultiply it out:\n\nFirst element: cos\u03b8 * 1 * cos\u03b8 + (-sin\u03b8) * (-1) * (-sin\u03b8)\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute the matrix product step by step.\n\n\u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is [ [1* cos\u03b8 + 0*(-sin\u03b8)], [0*cos\u03b8 + (-1)*(-sin\u03b8)] ] = [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8]^T.\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8(t)| \u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ] \u00b7 [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ] = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) (cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8).\n\nBecause cos(2\u03b8) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nNow, \u03b8 is gamma B t / 2. So 2\u03b8 = gamma B t.\n\nSo \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the magnetic moment mu is gamma S_z, so the average z-component of mu is mu_z = gamma \u27e8S_z\u27e9.\n\nSo mu_z(t) = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, gamma has units of (rad/s)/Tesla, I think. Because gamma = (gyromagnetic ratio) is typically given as 2\u03c0 times the Larmor frequency over B. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the units again.\n\nWait, but in our case, mu_z = gamma * S_z. So S_z is in units of \u0127/2, so mu_z is gamma * (\u0127/2).\n\nBut when we compute the expectation value, we have \u27e8mu_z\u27e9 = gamma * \u27e8S_z\u27e9.\n\nSo substituting the \u27e8S_z\u27e9 we found:\n\n\u27e8mu_z\u27e9 = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but the problem says the average of the z-component starts oscillating. So the frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine. The argument of cos is gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the options are given as gamma*B, gamma*B/2, etc. So looking at the options, option B is gamma*B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I miss a factor of 1/2 somewhere?\n\nWait, in the Hamiltonian, I had H = - mu \u00b7 B. But mu = gamma S. So H = - gamma S \u00b7 B. But when B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nThen, the time evolution is given by H. So the energy levels are determined by H, and the time evolution has a frequency determined by the energy difference.\n\nIn our calculation, the time dependence in the state leads to \u27e8mu_z\u27e9 oscillating with a frequency gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me check the calculation again. The argument of the cosine is gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B. So the average mu_z oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the average z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo looking at the options, option B is gamma * B. So the answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you have spin precession, the frequency is given by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency of the expectation value should be gamma B. So that would align with option B.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n",

Oh wait, but does turning off the field mean that the magnetic moment is no longer in a magnetic field? Or does it mean that the Hamiltonian changes? Because in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B. So when B is off, the Hamiltonian is zero? Or maybe the field is turned off and then another field is turned on along Y.\n\nWait, the problem says that the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along Y, same magnitude. So initially, the field was along Z, then it's turned off (so B=0), and then a new B along Y is applied, same magnitude as before. Wait, but the initial B was along Z, same magnitude as the new one along Y. So the initial B was B, and the new B is also B.\n\nWait, but the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Then, the field is turned off, so H becomes zero for a moment. Then, the field is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B, where B is along Y. So H becomes proportional to S_y.\n\nWait, but wait: the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, so when B is along Y, the interaction is mu \u00b7 B = gamma S_z B_y. Because B is along Y, B = (0, B, 0). So the dot product would be gamma S_z * B_y. But wait, S_z is the spin in the z-direction, and B is in Y. So that's gamma * S_z * B.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because if B is along Y, then the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, so the Hamiltonian H would be -mu \u00b7 B = -gamma S_z B (since B is in Y direction, so only the y-component of B is non-zero, but mu is in z, so the dot product is zero? Wait, no, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The magnetic moment is a vector, mu = gamma S, perhaps? Because in the question, it's written as mu = gamma S_z. Wait, the question says mu = gamma S_z, so that's only the z-component of the magnetic moment. Oh, but wait, that would imply that the magnetic moment is only in the z-direction, regardless of the spin direction. That can't be right because the magnetic moment is usually proportional to the spin vector. So maybe the question is written as mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. But the question says mu = gamma S_z, so perhaps it's only the z-component of the magnetic moment? That seems odd because the magnetic dipole moment would depend on the direction of the spin.\n\nWait, maybe I should read the question again. It says, \"magnetic moment mu (= gamma * S_z)\", which suggests that mu is the z-component of the magnetic moment. Or perhaps mu is a vector, and mu_z is gamma S_z. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma S, so the vector. So when the field is in the z direction, the energy is proportional to S_z. But when the field is turned to y, the energy becomes proportional to S_y.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that mu is the z-component of the magnetic moment. So, when the magnetic field is along y, the interaction energy is mu * B, but mu is along z, and B is along y. So their dot product would be zero, meaning no energy. That can't be right, because then the Hamiltonian would be zero, and there would be no oscillations. But the question says that the average z-component of the moment oscillates. So perhaps I misunderstood the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps mu is the vector magnetic moment. So mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. So when the field is along Z, the magnetic moment is aligned along Z, and when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment will precess around Y. So the expectation value of S_z will oscillate.\n\nLet me think about the time evolution. So initially, the spin is in the eigenstate of S_z, say |\u2191\u27e9. Then, when the magnetic field is turned off, the Hamiltonian is zero for a moment. Then, the field is turned on along Y, so H becomes proportional to S_y.\n\nWait, but when you change the Hamiltonian, the state doesn't change immediately. The state will evolve under the new Hamiltonian. So the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9, which is an eigenstate of S_z, but not of S_y.\n\nSo the time evolution is governed by H = - gamma B S_y (since mu = gamma S, and B is along Y, so H = - mu \u00b7 B = - gamma S \u00b7 B = -gamma B S_y).\n\nSo H = - gamma B S_y. But wait, in terms of units, the Hamiltonian should have units of energy. Let me make sure: S has units of \u0127, and gamma is (rad/s/T), I think. So B is in Tesla, and gamma*B has units of (rad/s), which makes sense for the Larmor frequency.\n\nWait, but the actual expression for H would be H = -gamma B S_y. Because S has units of \u0127, so gamma B S would have units of (rad/s) * (dimensionless) * \u0127. Hmm, perhaps I should be careful about the actual expression.\n\nBut regardless, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). So substituting H, we get U(t) = exp( i gamma B S_y t / \u0127 ). Wait, because H is negative, so the exponent is positive? Let me double-check: H = - gamma B S_y, so H t / \u0127 is (- gamma B S_y t)/ \u0127. So the exponent is -i H t / \u0127 = i gamma B S_y t / \u0127.\n\nNow, S_y is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli Y matrix. So S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. Therefore, H = - gamma B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. So substituting back into U(t):\n\nU(t) = exp( i gamma B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y t / \u0127 )\n\nSimplify: the \u0127 in numerator and denominator cancels, so:\n\nU(t) = exp( i (gamma B / 2) \u03c3_y t )\n\nBut the Pauli matrices are 2x2, so when exponentiating, we can use the identity for exponential of Pauli matrices. The exponential of i \u03b8 \u03c3 \u00b7 n is cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n), for a unit vector n.\n\nIn this case, the exponent is i (gamma B t / 2) \u03c3_y. So \u03b8 is (gamma B t / 2), and n is the y direction. So:\n\nU(t) = cos( gamma B t / 2 ) I + i sin( gamma B t / 2 ) \u03c3_y\n\nSo the time evolution operator is this matrix.\n\nNow, the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9, which is (1, 0)^T. Let's compute the state at time t: |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t) |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nCompute U(t) |\u2191\u27e9:\n\nLet me write U(t) as:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3_y ] acting on |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nBut wait, \u03c3_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So:\n\nU(t) = cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,1]] + i sin\u03b8 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nWhich is:\n\ncos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,1]] + i sin\u03b8 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\n= [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, cos\u03b8]] + [[0, -i^2 sin\u03b8], [i^2 sin\u03b8, 0]]\n\nWait, wait: Let's compute each element.\n\nTop left: cos\u03b8 * 1 + i sin\u03b8 * 0 = cos\u03b8.\n\nTop right: cos\u03b8 * 0 + i sin\u03b8 * (-i) = i*(-i) sin\u03b8 = (-i^2) sin\u03b8 = (1) sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, because i*(-i) is -i^2 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, bottom left: cos\u03b8 *0 + i sin\u03b8 * i = i^2 sin\u03b8 = - sin\u03b8.\n\nBottom right: cos\u03b8 *1 + i sin\u03b8 *0 = cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, so U(t) becomes:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [-sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8] ]\n\nWait, but I'm getting this because \u03c3_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]], so when multiplied by i sin\u03b8:\n\ni sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_y = [[0, -i^2 sin\u03b8], [i^2 sin\u03b8, 0]] = [[0, sin\u03b8], [-sin\u03b8, 0]]\n\nSo adding cos\u03b8 I:\n\nU(t) = [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [-sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8]]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo when we apply U(t) to |\u2191\u27e9 = [1, 0]^T, we get:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 * 1 + sin\u03b8 * 0,\n  -sin\u03b8 * 1 + cos\u03b8 * 0 ]\n\n= [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the state is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ]^T, where \u03b8 = gamma B t / 2.\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nS_z for spin 1/2 is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z = (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nSo let's compute \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nCompute this:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| \u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ] [[1,0],[0,-1]] [ cos\u03b8; -sin\u03b8 ]\n\nMultiply it out:\n\nFirst element: cos\u03b8 * 1 * cos\u03b8 + (-sin\u03b8) * (-1) * (-sin\u03b8)\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute the matrix product step by step.\n\n\u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is [ [1* cos\u03b8 + 0*(-sin\u03b8)], [0*cos\u03b8 + (-1)*(-sin\u03b8)] ] = [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8]^T.\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8(t)| \u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ] \u00b7 [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ] = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) (cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8).\n\nBecause cos(2\u03b8) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nNow, \u03b8 is gamma B t / 2. So 2\u03b8 = gamma B t.\n\nSo \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the magnetic moment mu is gamma S_z, so the average z-component of mu is mu_z = gamma \u27e8S_z\u27e9.\n\nSo mu_z(t) = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, gamma has units of (rad/s)/Tesla, I think. Because gamma = (gyromagnetic ratio) is typically given as 2\u03c0 times the Larmor frequency over B. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the units again.\n\nWait, but in our case, mu_z = gamma * S_z. So S_z is in units of \u0127/2, so mu_z is gamma * (\u0127/2).\n\nBut when we compute the expectation value, we have \u27e8mu_z\u27e9 = gamma * \u27e8S_z\u27e9.\n\nSo substituting the \u27e8S_z\u27e9 we found:\n\n\u27e8mu_z\u27e9 = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but the problem says the average of the z-component starts oscillating. So the frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine. The argument of cos is gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the options are given as gamma*B, gamma*B/2, etc. So looking at the options, option B is gamma*B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I miss a factor of 1/2 somewhere?\n\nWait, in the Hamiltonian, I had H = - mu \u00b7 B. But mu = gamma S. So H = - gamma S \u00b7 B. But when B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nThen, the time evolution is given by H. So the energy levels are determined by H, and the time evolution has a frequency determined by the energy difference.\n\nIn our calculation, the time dependence in the state leads to \u27e8mu_z\u27e9 oscillating with a frequency gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me check the calculation again. The argument of the cosine is gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B. So the average mu_z oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the average z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo looking at the options, option B is gamma * B. So the answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you have spin precession, the frequency is given by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency of the expectation value should be gamma B. So that would align with option B.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the +Z direction. The field is then turned off and reactivated along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial Setup**:  \n   The particle\u2019s spin is initially aligned with the magnetic field along +Z, meaning the state is an eigenstate of $S_z$. The magnetic moment $\\mu_z$ is proportional to $S_z$ via $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$.\n\n2. **Field Change**:  \n   When the magnetic field is turned off and reactivated along +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\\mu \\cdot B = -\\gamma B S_y$. This causes the spin to precess around the new field direction.\n\n3. **Time Evolution**:  \n   The time evolution operator is $U(t) = \\exp(-iHt/\\hbar) = \\exp(i\\gamma B S_y t / \\hbar)$. Using the properties of Pauli matrices, $S_y = (\\hbar/2)\\sigma_y$, the operator simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   U(t) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right)I + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right)\\sigma_y.\n   \\]\n\n4. **State Evolution**:  \n   The initial state $| \\uparrow \\rangle = (1, 0)^T$ evolves under $U(t)$ to:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right) \\\\ -\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right) \\end{bmatrix}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  \n   The expectation value of $S_z$ is computed as:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   Since $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$, the expectation value of $\\mu_z$ becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n\n6. **Oscillation Frequency**:  \n   The oscillation of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ is governed by the cosine term, with the argument $\\gamma B t$. Thus, the oscillation frequency is $\\gamma B$.\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Options:\n- **Option A ($\\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The frequency is not halved; the argument of the cosine directly gives the frequency.\n- **Option B ($\\gamma B$)**: Correct. The oscillation frequency matches the coefficient of $t$ in the cosine argument.\n- **Option C ($\\sqrt{2}\\gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ in the oscillation frequency.\n- **Option D ($\\gamma B / \\sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The frequency is not reduced by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$.\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to unpack what's going on.\n\nThe question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. So mu = \u03b3 S_z. The particle is initially in a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.\n\nHmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think. So, spin-1/2 particles, like electrons, have spin angular momentum that can be up or down along a chosen axis. The magnetic moment is proportional to the spin, with the gyromagnetic ratio gamma.\n\nInitially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the Hamiltonian before the change would be H_initial = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since the field is along Z, the magnetic moment aligns with it. The energy levels for spin-1/2 would be E = \u00b1 (\u03bc B)/2, since \u03bc is proportional to S_z, and S_z can be \u00b1 \u0127/2. Wait, but wait, the magnetic moment \u03bc is given as \u03b3 S_z. So, let me think about the Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, the general form for the Hamiltonian due to a magnetic field is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. So when B is along +Z, H = -\u03bc_z B. Substituting \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z, H_initial = -\u03b3 B S_z. The eigenvalues for S_z are \u00b1 \u0127/2, so the energies are E = \u00b1 \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). So the energy levels are split by 2 times the positive value, which is \u03b3 B \u0127.\n\nBut then the magnetic field is turned off (so B becomes zero) and another one is turned on along +Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -\u03bc \u00b7 B' where B' is along +Y. So H_final = -\u03b3 B S_y. Because S is the spin operator, and the direction changes.\n\nWait, but when the magnetic field changes, the spin state of the particle doesn't change instantaneously. So the initial state of the system is the eigenstate of S_z, either up or down. After the field is changed, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.\n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, <\u03bc_z>, and how it oscillates over time. So I need to find the expectation value of \u03bc_z as a function of time after the field is changed.\n\nLet me break it down. The initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's assume it's the spin-up state along Z, which we can denote as |\u2191_z>.\n\nWhen the Hamiltonian changes to H = -\u03b3 B S_y, the system will evolve under this new Hamiltonian. The time evolution is given by the time-dependent solution, but since the Hamiltonian is time-independent after the change, we can use the time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me get the units right. Let's express H in terms of angular frequency. The energy of the system under H will determine the oscillation frequencies.\n\nThe Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the energy levels after the change will be E = -\u03b3 B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So the energy difference between the two states is 2 * (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) ) = \u03b3 B \u0127. So the frequency of oscillation between the states would be determined by this energy difference divided by \u0127.\n\nBut wait, the question isn't about the state oscillations directly; it's about the expectation value of \u03bc_z. So the average \u03bc_z is \u27e8\u03c8(t)| \u03bc_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nLet me think. The initial state is |\u2191_z\u27e9. Let's denote the eigenstates of S_y as |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. The initial state |\u2191_z\u27e9 can be expressed in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, the spin-up state along Z can be written as a combination of spin-up and spin-down along Y. Let's recall that:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|\u2191_z\u27e9 + i|\u2193_z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n|-y\u27e9 = (|\u2191_z\u27e9 - i|\u2193_z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me get the correct transformation. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. The relation between the Z basis and Y basis can be found using rotation matrices.\n\nThe rotation from Z to Y would involve a rotation of 90 degrees around the X-axis. So, the transformation is:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|\u2191_z\u27e9 + i |\u2193_z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n|-y\u27e9 = (|\u2191_z\u27e9 - i |\u2193_z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nSo the initial state |\u2191_z\u27e9 can be expressed as:\n\n|\u2191_z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nBecause:\n\n( |+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 = [ (|\u2191_z\u27e9 + i |\u2193_z\u27e9) + (|\u2191_z\u27e9 - i |\u2193_z\u27e9) ) ] / (2\u221a2) ) \u2192 [2 |\u2191_z\u27e9 ]/(2\u221a2) ) = |\u2191_z\u27e9 /\u221a2. Wait, that doesn't add up. Hmm, maybe I should compute the expansion coefficients more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express |\u2191_z\u27e9 in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me write:\n\n|\u2191_z\u27e9 = a |+y\u27e9 + b |-y\u27e9\n\nWe can find a and b by solving the equations. Let me compute the inner product of both sides with \u27e8+y| and \u27e8-y|.\n\n\u27e8+y|\u2191_z\u27e9 = a \u27e8+y|+y\u27e9 + b \u27e8+y|-y\u27e9 \u2192 a = \u27e8+y|\u2191_z\u27e9.\n\nSimilarly, \u27e8-y|\u2191_z\u27e9 = b.\n\nWhat is \u27e8+y|\u2191_z\u27e9? Since |+y\u27e9 is (|\u2191_z\u27e9 + i |\u2193_z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\n\u27e8+y|\u2191_z\u27e9 = (\u27e8\u2191_z| + i \u27e8\u2193_z| ) /\u221a2 * |\u2191_z\u27e9 \u2192 1/\u221a2.\n\nSimilarly, \u27e8-y|\u2191_z\u27e9 is 1/\u221a2. So:\n\n|\u2191_z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) |+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2) |-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, no, because when you compute \u27e8+y|\u2191_z\u27e9, you get (1/\u221a2), because \u27e8\u2191_z|\u2191_z\u27e9 is 1, and the other term is zero. So a = 1/\u221a2, same for b.\n\nSo |\u2191_z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9) /\u221a2.\n\nWait, but when I take |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 and add them, each has a 1/\u221a2 factor, so when I add them and divide by \u221a2, I get 1/\u221a2 * (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9) ) = |\u2191_z\u27e9. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the initial state is a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. Because the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, its eigenstates are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, with eigenvalues E_+ and E_-.\n\nThe time evolution under H_final will cause the state to evolve as:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) [ e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i E_- t/\u0127} |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nWhat are E_+ and E_-?\n\nH_final = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nThe eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So,\n\nE_+ = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2)\nE_- = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2 )\n\nWait, because S_y |+y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) |+y\u27e9.\n\nSo,\n\nE_+ = -\u03b3 B * (\u0127/2)\nE_- = -\u03b3 B * (-\u0127/2) = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2 )\n\nSo, E_+ = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 )/ 2\nE_- = (\u03b3 B \u0127 )/ 2\n\nSo the time evolution factors are:\n\nFor |+y\u27e9: exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) t / \u0127 ) = exp( i \u03b3 B t / 2 )\n\nSimilarly, for |-y\u27e9: exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ) t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i \u03b3 B t / 2 )\n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) [ e^{i \u03b3 B t / 2 } |+y\u27e9 + e^{ -i \u03b3 B t / 2 } |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nNow, the magnetic moment in the z-direction is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z.\n\nSo, to find the expectation value \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9, we compute:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| \u03bc_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9\n\nBecause \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z.\n\nSo, let's compute \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nExpressed in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, S_z can be represented in the Y basis.\n\nWait, I need to find S_z in the Y basis. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express S_z in terms of the ladder operators.\n\nWait, S_z is diagonal in the Z basis, but in the Y basis, it's off-diagonal. Alternatively, perhaps I can write S_z in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the matrix elements of S_z in the Y basis.\n\nThe eigenstates |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 are orthogonal, so the matrix for S_z in this basis is:\n\nS_z = [ [ < +y | S_z | +y > , < +y | S_z | -y > ],\n         [ < -y | S_z | +y > , < -y | S_z | -y > ] ]\n\nI need to compute these matrix elements.\n\nLet me recall that S_z |\u2191_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) |\u2191_z\u27e9, and similarly for |\u2193_z\u27e9.\n\nExpressed in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\n|\u2191_z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2\n|\u2193_z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/(i\u221a2) [Wait, perhaps I should double-check.]\n\nWait, earlier I had |\u2191_z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2, and |\u2193_z\u27e9 would be (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/i\u221a2.\n\nBecause the state |\u2193_z\u27e9 is orthogonal to |\u2191_z\u27e9. So:\n\n\u27e8\u2191_z | \u2193_z\u27e9 = 0 \u2192 [ (\u27e8+y| + \u27e8-y|)/\u221a2 ] [ (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/(i\u221a2) ) ] = (1/(i 2)) [ (\u27e8+y|+y\u27e9 ) - \u27e8+y|-y\u27e9 + \u27e8-y|+y\u27e9 - \u27e8-y|-y\u27e9 ].\n\nBut \u27e8+y|+y\u27e9 =1, others are zero. So (1/(i 2)) (1 -0 +0 -1 )= (0)/(i 2 )=0. So that works.\n\nNow, S_z |+y\u27e9 = S_z ( |\u2191_z\u27e9 + i |\u2193_z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2.\n\nCompute this:\n\nS_z |\u2191_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) |\u2191_z\u27e9\nS_z |\u2193_z\u27e9 = -(\u0127/2) |\u2193_z\u27e9\n\nSo,\n\nS_z |+y\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) [ (\u0127/2)|\u2191_z\u27e9 + i ( - \u0127/2 ) |\u2193_z\u27e9 ]\n\n= (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) [ |\u2191_z\u27e9 - i |\u2193_z\u27e9 ]\n\nBut |\u2191_z\u27e9 is (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2, and |\u2193_z\u27e9 is (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/(i\u221a2).\n\nSubstituting these in:\n\n= (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) [ (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 - i (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/(i\u221a2) ]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nThe first term: (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 \u2192 multiply by 1/\u221a2 \u2192 (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/(2)\n\nThe second term: -i (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/(i\u221a2) \u2192 the i's cancel, and the negative becomes positive because -i * i = 1.\n\nSo, (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 \u2192 multiply by 1/\u221a2 \u2192 (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/(2)\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n= (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) [ (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9 + |+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9 ) / 2 ]\n\nWait, no: Wait, each term is multiplied by 1/(2\u221a2) and 1/(2\u221a2), but wait, let's re-express:\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

That would mean that the off-diagonal terms are zero, which would imply that S_z doesn't mix |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, which seems counterintuitive because a rotation from Y to Z would imply that the states are superpositions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the matrix elements. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute \u27e8+y| S_z | -y\u27e9.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n\u27e8+y| S_z | -y\u27e9 = \u27e8 (\u2191_z + i \u2193_z ) /\u221a2 | S_z ( (\u2191_z - i \u2193_z ) /\u221a2 ) \u27e9\n\nS_z (\u2191_z - i \u2193_z ) = (\u0127/2) \u2191_z - i ( - \u0127/2 ) \u2193_z = (\u0127/2) \u2191_z + i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8+y| S_z | -y\u27e9 = (1/2) [ \u27e8\u2191_z | (\u0127/2) \u2191_z \u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191_z | i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z \u27e9 + i \u27e8\u2193_z | (\u0127/2) \u2191_z \u27e9 + i \u27e8\u2193_z | i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z \u27e9 ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\n\u27e8\u2191_z | (\u0127/2) \u2191_z \u27e9 = (\u0127/2)*1.\n\n\u27e8\u2191_z | i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z \u27e9 = i (\u0127/2)*0 = 0.\n\ni \u27e8\u2193_z | (\u0127/2) \u2191_z \u27e9 = i (\u0127/2)*0 =0.\n\ni \u27e8\u2193_z | i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z \u27e9 = i^2 (\u0127/2) *1 = (-1) (\u0127/2 )= - \u0127/2.\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ (\u0127/2) + 0 + 0 - (\u0127/2) ) ] = (1/2)(0) = 0.\n\nSo the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the matrix for S_z in the Y basis is diagonal, with entries \u0127/2 and -\u0127/2. That's surprising. So, S_z |+y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|+y\u27e9, and S_z |-y\u27e9 = (-\u0127/2)|-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 are eigenstates of S_y, not S_z. So perhaps this implies that S_z is diagonal in the Y basis? That seems conflicting, but perhaps it's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about this differently. Since S_x, S_y, and S_z don't commute, their eigenbases are different. But for each operator, their eigenstates are orthogonal, and the other operators' matrix representations in that basis are not diagonal.\n\nWait, but according to the calculations, S_z is diagonal in the Y basis. So in that case, the expectation value \u27e8S_z\u27e9 in the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 can be computed easily.\n\nBecause |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is a superposition of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, each with time-dependent phases.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9\n\n= (1/\u221a2)^2 [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8+y| S_z |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8-y| S_z |-y\u27e9 + e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8+y| S_z |-y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8-y| S_z |+y\u27e9 ]\n\nWait, but earlier we found that \u27e8+y| S_z |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/2, \u27e8-y| S_z |-y\u27e9 = - \u0127/2, and the off-diagonal terms are zero.\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ (1) (\u0127/2) + (1) (- \u0127/2) + 0 + 0 ) ]\n\nWait, because the cross terms involve \u27e8+y| S_z |-y\u27e9 and \u27e8-y| S_z |+y\u27e9, which are zero.\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ (\u0127/2) + (- \u0127/2) ) ] = (1/2)(0) )= 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the average \u03bc_z is zero, which would imply no oscillation. But the question says the average starts oscillating. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think about the time evolution differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the time dependence of the state and compute the expectation value of S_z.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in expressing the initial state as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me go back.\n\nThe initial state is |\u2191_z\u27e9. After the field change, the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The time evolution is determined by H, so the state evolves as |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^(-i H t / \u0127) |\u2191_z\u27e9.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to express the time evolution in terms of the energy eigenstates.\n\nThe initial state |\u2191_z\u27e9 can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of H_final. Since H_final = -\u03b3 B S_y, its eigenstates are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, with energies E_+ = - (\u03b3 B \u0127/2 ) and E_- = \u03b3 B \u0127/2.\n\nSo, |\u2191_z\u27e9 = c_+ |+y\u27e9 + c_- |-y\u27e9.\n\nAs before, c_+ = c_- = 1/\u221a2.\n\nSo, the state at time t is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = c_+ e^(-i E_+ t/\u0127) |+y\u27e9 + c_- e^(-i E_- t/\u0127) |-y\u27e9.\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\n= (1/\u221a2) [ e^{i (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) t / \u0127} |+y\u27e9 + e^{ -i (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 } |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\n= (1/\u221a2) [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} |+y\u27e9 + e^{ -i \u03b3 B t/2 } |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nNow, the magnetic moment in the z-direction is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z.\n\nSo, the expectation value of \u03bc_z is:\n\n\u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8 S_z \u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nWe can compute this as:\n\n= \u03b3 [ (1/\u221a2) e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8+y| + (1/\u221a2) e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8-y| ] S_z [ (1/\u221a2) e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} |+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2) e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= \u03b3 (1/2) [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8+y| S_z |+y\u27e9 + e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8+y| S_z |-y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8-y| S_z |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8-y| S_z |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nBut as we found earlier, the cross terms (\u27e8+y| S_z |-y\u27e9 and \u27e8-y| S_z |+y\u27e9 ) are zero. So,\n\n= \u03b3 (1/2) [ (1) \u27e8+y| S_z |+y\u27e9 + (1) \u27e8-y| S_z |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nAs computed earlier, \u27e8+y| S_z |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/2 and \u27e8-y| S_z |-y\u27e9 = - \u0127/2.\n\nSo,\n\n= \u03b3 (1/2) [ (\u0127/2) + (- \u0127/2) ) ] = \u03b3 (1/2)(0) )= 0.\n\nWait, that's zero. But the question states that the average starts oscillating. So this can't be right. I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps I should consider that the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, which leads to precession around the Y-axis. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally with time.\n\nLet me think about the time evolution more carefully. The state |\u2191_z\u27e9 is a superposition of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, each with a phase factor that depends on time.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the time evolution using the matrix representation.\n\nThe Hamiltonian H = -\u03b3 B S_y = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.\n\nThe time evolution operator U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 )\n\nSubstituting H:\n\nU(t) = exp( -i (-\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y ) t / \u0127 )\n\n= exp( i \u03b3 B \u03c3_y t (t) / 2 )\n\nSo,\n\nU(t) = exp( i (\u03b3 B t/2 ) \u03c3_y )\n\nThe Pauli matrix \u03c3_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]].\n\nThe exponential of i \u03b8 \u03c3_y is given by:\n\nexp( i \u03b8 \u03c3_y ) = cos(\u03b8) I + i sin(\u03b8) \u03c3_y.\n\nSo, for \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t/2),\n\nU(t) = cos(\u03b3 B t/2) I + i sin(\u03b3 B t/2) \u03c3_y.\n\nThe initial state is |\u2191_z\u27e9 = [1; 0].\n\nSo, the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t) |\u2191_z\u27e9.\n\nLet's compute this:\n\nU(t) |\u2191_z\u27e9 = [ cos(\u03b8) I + i sin(\u03b8) \u03c3_y ] [1; 0 ]\n\n= cos(\u03b8) [1; 0 ] + i sin(\u03b8) \u03c3_y [1; 0 ]\n\nCompute \u03c3_y [1;0 ]:\n\n\u03c3_y [1;0 ] = [ 0*(-i) + (-i)*0, i*1 + 0*0 ]?

B is in Tesla. So gamma * B has units of rad/s, which would make the argument of cos correct.\n\nThe average oscillates with frequency equal to gamma B.\n\nWait, but looking at the expression, the time dependence is cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The argument inside the cosine is (gamma B) t, which would imply a frequency of gamma B, because the general form is cos(omega t), where omega is the angular frequency.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is omega = gamma B.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, wait. I thought the time evolution involved a factor of theta = (gamma B t/2 ), and then in the expectation value, we had 2 theta, leading to gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option B: gamma B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because in the calculation, the expectation value \u27e8S_z\u27e9 oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), which has a frequency of gamma B.\n\nSo the average of mu_z oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the answer is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to unpack what's going on.\n\nThe question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. So mu = \u03b3 S_z. The particle is initially in a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.\n\nHmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think. So, spin-1/2 particles, like electrons, have spin angular momentum that can be up or down along a chosen axis. The magnetic moment is proportional to the spin, with the gyromagnetic ratio gamma.\n\nInitially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the Hamiltonian before the change would be H_initial = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since the field is along Z, the magnetic moment aligns with it. The energy levels for spin-1/2 would be E = \u00b1 (\u03bc B)/2, since \u03bc is proportional to S_z, and S_z can be \u00b1 \u0127/2. Wait, but wait, the magnetic moment \u03bc is given as \u03b3 S_z. So, let me think about the Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, the general form for the Hamiltonian due to a magnetic field is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. So when B is along +Z, H = -\u03bc_z B. Substituting \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z, H_initial = -\u03b3 B S_z. The eigenvalues for S_z are \u00b1 \u0127/2, so the energies are E = \u00b1 \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). So the energy levels are split by 2 times the positive value, which is \u03b3 B \u0127.\n\nBut then the magnetic field is turned off (so B becomes zero) and another one is turned on along +Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -\u03bc \u00b7 B' where B' is along +Y. So H_final = -\u03b3 B S_y. Because S is the spin operator, and the direction changes.\n\nWait, but when the magnetic field changes, the spin state of the particle doesn't change instantaneously. So the initial state of the system is the eigenstate of S_z, either up or down. After the field is changed, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.\n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, <\u03bc_z>, and how it oscillates over time. So I need to find the expectation value of \u03bc_z as a function of time after the field is changed.\n\nLet me break it down. The initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's assume it's the spin-up state along Z, which we can denote as |\u2191_z>.\n\nWhen the Hamiltonian changes to H = -\u03b3 B S_y, the system will evolve under this new Hamiltonian. The time evolution is given by the time-dependent solution, but since the Hamiltonian is time-independent after the change, we can use the time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me get the units right. Let's express H in terms of angular frequency. The energy of the system under H will determine the oscillation frequencies.\n\nThe Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the energy levels after the change will be E = -\u03b3 B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So the energy difference between the two states is 2 * (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) ) = \u03b3 B \u0127. So the frequency of oscillation between the states would be determined by this energy difference divided by \u0127.\n\nBut wait, the question isn't about the state oscillations directly; it's about the expectation value of \u03bc_z. So the average \u03bc_z is \u27e8\u03c8(t)| \u03bc_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nLet me think. The initial state is |\u2191_z\u27e9. Let's denote the eigenstates of S_y as |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. The initial state |\u2191_z\u27e9 can be expressed in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, the spin-up state along Z can be written as a combination of spin-up and spin-down along Y. Let's recall that:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|\u2191_z\u27e9 + i|\u2193_z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n|-y\u27e9 = (|\u2191_z\u27e9 - i|\u2193_z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me get the correct transformation. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. The relation between the Z basis and Y basis can be found using rotation matrices.\n\nThe rotation from Z to Y would involve a rotation of 90 degrees around the X-axis. So, the transformation is:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|\u2191_z\u27e9 + i |\u2193_z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n|-y\u27e9 = (|\u2191_z\u27e9 - i |\u2193_z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nSo the initial state |\u2191_z\u27e9 can be expressed as:\n\n|\u2191_z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nBecause:\n\n( |+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 = [ (|\u2191_z\u27e9 + i |\u2193_z\u27e9) + (|\u2191_z\u27e9 - i |\u2193_z\u27e9) ) ] / (2\u221a2) ) \u2192 [2 |\u2191_z\u27e9 ]/(2\u221a2) ) = |\u2191_z\u27e9 /\u221a2. Wait, that doesn't add up. Hmm, maybe I should compute the expansion coefficients more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express |\u2191_z\u27e9 in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me write:\n\n|\u2191_z\u27e9 = a |+y\u27e9 + b |-y\u27e9\n\nWe can find a and b by solving the equations. Let me compute the inner product of both sides with \u27e8+y| and \u27e8-y|.\n\n\u27e8+y|\u2191_z\u27e9 = a \u27e8+y|+y\u27e9 + b \u27e8+y|-y\u27e9 \u2192 a = \u27e8+y|\u2191_z\u27e9.\n\nSimilarly, \u27e8-y|\u2191_z\u27e9 = b.\n\nWhat is \u27e8+y|\u2191_z\u27e9? Since |+y\u27e9 is (|\u2191_z\u27e9 + i |\u2193_z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\n\u27e8+y|\u2191_z\u27e9 = (\u27e8\u2191_z| + i \u27e8\u2193_z| ) /\u221a2 * |\u2191_z\u27e9 \u2192 1/\u221a2.\n\nSimilarly, \u27e8-y|\u2191_z\u27e9 is 1/\u221a2. So:\n\n|\u2191_z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) |+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2) |-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, no, because when you compute \u27e8+y|\u2191_z\u27e9, you get (1/\u221a2), because \u27e8\u2191_z|\u2191_z\u27e9 is 1, and the other term is zero. So a = 1/\u221a2, same for b.\n\nSo |\u2191_z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9) /\u221a2.\n\nWait, but when I take |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 and add them, each has a 1/\u221a2 factor, so when I add them and divide by \u221a2, I get 1/\u221a2 * (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9) ) = |\u2191_z\u27e9. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the initial state is a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. Because the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, its eigenstates are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, with eigenvalues E_+ and E_-.\n\nThe time evolution under H_final will cause the state to evolve as:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) [ e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i E_- t/\u0127} |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nWhat are E_+ and E_-?\n\nH_final = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nThe eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So,\n\nE_+ = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2)\nE_- = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2 )\n\nWait, because S_y |+y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) |+y\u27e9.\n\nSo,\n\nE_+ = -\u03b3 B * (\u0127/2)\nE_- = -\u03b3 B * (-\u0127/2) = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2 )\n\nSo, E_+ = - (\u03b3 B \u0127 )/ 2\nE_- = (\u03b3 B \u0127 )/ 2\n\nSo the time evolution factors are:\n\nFor |+y\u27e9: exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) t / \u0127 ) = exp( i \u03b3 B t / 2 )\n\nSimilarly, for |-y\u27e9: exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ) t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i \u03b3 B t / 2 )\n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) [ e^{i \u03b3 B t / 2 } |+y\u27e9 + e^{ -i \u03b3 B t / 2 } |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nNow, the magnetic moment in the z-direction is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z.\n\nSo, to find the expectation value \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9, we compute:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| \u03bc_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9\n\nBecause \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z.\n\nSo, let's compute \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nExpressed in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, S_z can be represented in the Y basis.\n\nWait, I need to find S_z in the Y basis. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express S_z in terms of the ladder operators.\n\nWait, S_z is diagonal in the Z basis, but in the Y basis, it's off-diagonal. Alternatively, perhaps I can write S_z in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the matrix elements of S_z in the Y basis.\n\nThe eigenstates |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 are orthogonal, so the matrix for S_z in this basis is:\n\nS_z = [ [ < +y | S_z | +y > , < +y | S_z | -y > ],\n         [ < -y | S_z | +y > , < -y | S_z | -y > ] ]\n\nI need to compute these matrix elements.\n\nLet me recall that S_z |\u2191_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) |\u2191_z\u27e9, and similarly for |\u2193_z\u27e9.\n\nExpressed in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\n|\u2191_z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2\n|\u2193_z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/(i\u221a2) [Wait, perhaps I should double-check.]\n\nWait, earlier I had |\u2191_z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2, and |\u2193_z\u27e9 would be (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/i\u221a2.\n\nBecause the state |\u2193_z\u27e9 is orthogonal to |\u2191_z\u27e9. So:\n\n\u27e8\u2191_z | \u2193_z\u27e9 = 0 \u2192 [ (\u27e8+y| + \u27e8-y|)/\u221a2 ] [ (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/(i\u221a2) ) ] = (1/(i 2)) [ (\u27e8+y|+y\u27e9 ) - \u27e8+y|-y\u27e9 + \u27e8-y|+y\u27e9 - \u27e8-y|-y\u27e9 ].\n\nBut \u27e8+y|+y\u27e9 =1, others are zero. So (1/(i 2)) (1 -0 +0 -1 )= (0)/(i 2 )=0. So that works.\n\nNow, S_z |+y\u27e9 = S_z ( |\u2191_z\u27e9 + i |\u2193_z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2.\n\nCompute this:\n\nS_z |\u2191_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) |\u2191_z\u27e9\nS_z |\u2193_z\u27e9 = -(\u0127/2) |\u2193_z\u27e9\n\nSo,\n\nS_z |+y\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) [ (\u0127/2)|\u2191_z\u27e9 + i ( - \u0127/2 ) |\u2193_z\u27e9 ]\n\n= (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) [ |\u2191_z\u27e9 - i |\u2193_z\u27e9 ]\n\nBut |\u2191_z\u27e9 is (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2, and |\u2193_z\u27e9 is (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/(i\u221a2).\n\nSubstituting these in:\n\n= (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) [ (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 - i (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/(i\u221a2) ]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nThe first term: (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 \u2192 multiply by 1/\u221a2 \u2192 (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/(2)\n\nThe second term: -i (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/(i\u221a2) \u2192 the i's cancel, and the negative becomes positive because -i * i = 1.\n\nSo, (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 \u2192 multiply by 1/\u221a2 \u2192 (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/(2)\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n= (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) [ (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9 + |+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9 ) / 2 ]\n\nWait, no: Wait, each term is multiplied by 1/(2\u221a2) and 1/(2\u221a2), but wait, let's re-express:\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it step by step. Let me correct that.\n\nSo,\n\nS_z |+y\u27e9 = (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) [ (|\u2191_z\u27e9) - i |\u2193_z\u27e9 ]\n\nExpress |\u2191_z\u27e9 and |\u2193_z\u27e9 in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\n|\u2191_z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9) /\u221a2\n\n|\u2193_z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/(i\u221a2)\n\nSo,\n\n= (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) [ (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 - i (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/(i\u221a2) ]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 \u2192 multiply by 1/(2\u221a2) \u2192 (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9) / (2 * 2) )= (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/4\n\nSecond term: -i (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9) / (i\u221a2) \u2192 the i's cancel. The negative i times i is -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nMultiply by 1/(2\u221a2) \u2192 (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9) / (2 * 2) )= (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/4.\n\nSo combining the two terms:\n\n( |+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9 + |+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9 ) /4\n\n= [ 2 |+y\u27e9 ] /4 = (|+y\u27e9)/2.\n\nSo S_z |+y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) (|+y\u27e9)/2 )? Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nWait, the entire expression is:\n\n(\u0127/(2\u221a2)) [ (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) ] + [ (|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) ]\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step. Let me re-express this.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's compute S_z in the Y basis.\n\nWe know that S_z is a Hermitian operator, and in the Z basis, it's diagonal.

The mistake is probably that S_z is not diagonal in the Y basis. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: The spin matrices.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices can be used to represent spin-1/2 systems.\n\nS_x = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_x\nS_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y\nS_z = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z\n\nSo, the spin matrices are:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\u03c3_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]\n\u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nSo, in the Y basis, which is the eigenbasis of S_y, the matrix for S_z would be in terms of the basis vectors |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, the eigenstates |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 correspond to the eigenvectors of \u03c3_y.\n\nBut the matrix representation of S_z in the Y basis is [ [ \u27e8+y| S_z |+y\u27e9, \u27e8+y| S_z |-y\u27e9 ],\n[ \u27e8-y| S_z |+y\u27e9, \u27e8-y| S_z |-y\u27e9 ] ]\n\nWait, from earlier, I found \u27e8+y| S_z |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/2.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute \u27e8-y| S_z | -y\u27e9.\n\n| -y \u27e9 = (|\u2191_z\u27e9 - i |\u2193_z\u27e9 )/\u221a2.\n\nSo,\n\nS_z | -y \u27e9 = (S_z |\u2191_z\u27e9 - i S_z |\u2193_z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2\n= ( (\u0127/2)|\u2191_z\u27e9 - i (-\u0127/2)|\u2193_z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2\n= [ (\u0127/2)|\u2191_z\u27e9 + i (\u0127/2)|\u2193_z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2.\n\nThen,\n\n\u27e8-y| S_z | -y \u27e9 = \u27e8 (\u2191_z - i \u2193_z )/\u221a2 | [ (\u0127/2)\u2191_z + i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z ] /\u221a2 \u27e9\n\n= (1/2) [ \u27e8\u2191_z | (\u0127/2)\u2191_z \u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191_z | i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z \u27e9 - i \u27e8\u2193_z | (\u0127/2)\u2191_z \u27e9 - i \u27e8\u2193_z | i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z \u27e9 ]\n\nEach term:\n\n\u27e8\u2191_z | (\u0127/2)\u2191_z \u27e9 = \u0127/2 *1.\n\n\u27e8\u2191_z | i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z \u27e9 = i (\u0127/2) * 0 =0.\n\n- i \u27e8\u2193_z | (\u0127/2)\u2191_z \u27e9 = -i (\u0127/2)*0 =0.\n\n- i \u27e8\u2193_z | i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z \u27e9 = -i (i) (\u0127/2) *1 = (i^2 is -1, so -i * i = -i^2=1) \u2192 1 * \u0127/2 = \u0127/2.\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ (\u0127/2) + 0 + 0 + (\u0127/2) ) ] = (1/2)( \u0127 ) ) = \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the eigenstates of S_y should have different eigenvalues for S_z. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Because |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 are eigenstates of S_y, but S_z doesn't share the same eigenbasis as S_y. So perhaps S_z is diagonal in the Y basis? That would mean that the off-diagonal terms are zero, which would imply that S_z doesn't mix |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, which seems counterintuitive because a rotation from Y to Z would imply that the states are superpositions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the matrix elements. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute \u27e8+y| S_z | -y\u27e9.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n\u27e8+y| S_z | -y\u27e9 = \u27e8 (\u2191_z + i \u2193_z ) /\u221a2 | S_z ( (\u2191_z - i \u2193_z ) /\u221a2 ) \u27e9\n\nS_z (\u2191_z - i \u2193_z ) = (\u0127/2) \u2191_z - i ( - \u0127/2 ) \u2193_z = (\u0127/2) \u2191_z + i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8+y| S_z | -y\u27e9 = (1/2) [ \u27e8\u2191_z | (\u0127/2) \u2191_z \u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191_z | i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z \u27e9 + i \u27e8\u2193_z | (\u0127/2) \u2191_z \u27e9 + i \u27e8\u2193_z | i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z \u27e9 ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\n\u27e8\u2191_z | (\u0127/2) \u2191_z \u27e9 = (\u0127/2)*1.\n\n\u27e8\u2191_z | i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z \u27e9 = i (\u0127/2)*0 = 0.\n\ni \u27e8\u2193_z | (\u0127/2) \u2191_z \u27e9 = i (\u0127/2)*0 =0.\n\ni \u27e8\u2193_z | i (\u0127/2) \u2193_z \u27e9 = i^2 (\u0127/2) *1 = (-1) (\u0127/2 )= - \u0127/2.\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ (\u0127/2) + 0 + 0 - (\u0127/2) ) ] = (1/2)(0) = 0.\n\nSo the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the matrix for S_z in the Y basis is diagonal, with entries \u0127/2 and -\u0127/2. That's surprising. So, S_z |+y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|+y\u27e9, and S_z |-y\u27e9 = (-\u0127/2)|-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 are eigenstates of S_y, not S_z. So perhaps this implies that S_z is diagonal in the Y basis? That seems conflicting, but perhaps it's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about this differently. Since S_x, S_y, and S_z don't commute, their eigenbases are different. But for each operator, their eigenstates are orthogonal, and the other operators' matrix representations in that basis are not diagonal.\n\nWait, but according to the calculations, S_z is diagonal in the Y basis. So in that case, the expectation value \u27e8S_z\u27e9 in the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 can be computed easily.\n\nBecause |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is a superposition of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, each with time-dependent phases.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9\n\n= (1/\u221a2)^2 [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8+y| S_z |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8-y| S_z |-y\u27e9 + e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8+y| S_z |-y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8-y| S_z |+y\u27e9 ]\n\nWait, but earlier we found that \u27e8+y| S_z |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/2, \u27e8-y| S_z |-y\u27e9 = - \u0127/2, and the off-diagonal terms are zero.\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ (1) (\u0127/2) + (1) (- \u0127/2) + 0 + 0 ) ]\n\nWait, because the cross terms involve \u27e8+y| S_z |-y\u27e9 and \u27e8-y| S_z |+y\u27e9, which are zero.\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ (\u0127/2) + (- \u0127/2) ) ] = (1/2)(0) )= 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the average \u03bc_z is zero, which would imply no oscillation. But the question says the average starts oscillating. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think about the time evolution differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the time dependence of the state and compute the expectation value of S_z.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in expressing the initial state as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me go back.\n\nThe initial state is |\u2191_z\u27e9. After the field change, the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The time evolution is determined by H, so the state evolves as |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^(-i H t / \u0127) |\u2191_z\u27e9.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to express the time evolution in terms of the energy eigenstates.\n\nThe initial state |\u2191_z\u27e9 can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of H_final. Since H_final = -\u03b3 B S_y, its eigenstates are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, with energies E_+ = - (\u03b3 B \u0127/2 ) and E_- = \u03b3 B \u0127/2.\n\nSo, |\u2191_z\u27e9 = c_+ |+y\u27e9 + c_- |-y\u27e9.\n\nAs before, c_+ = c_- = 1/\u221a2.\n\nSo, the state at time t is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = c_+ e^(-i E_+ t/\u0127) |+y\u27e9 + c_- e^(-i E_- t/\u0127) |-y\u27e9.\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\n= (1/\u221a2) [ e^{i (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) t / \u0127} |+y\u27e9 + e^{ -i (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 } |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\n= (1/\u221a2) [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} |+y\u27e9 + e^{ -i \u03b3 B t/2 } |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nNow, the magnetic moment in the z-direction is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z.\n\nSo, the expectation value of \u03bc_z is:\n\n\u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8 S_z \u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nWe can compute this as:\n\n= \u03b3 [ (1/\u221a2) e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8+y| + (1/\u221a2) e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8-y| ] S_z [ (1/\u221a2) e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} |+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2) e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= \u03b3 (1/2) [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8+y| S_z |+y\u27e9 + e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8+y| S_z |-y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8-y| S_z |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8-y| S_z |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nBut as we found earlier, the cross terms (\u27e8+y| S_z |-y\u27e9 and \u27e8-y| S_z |+y\u27e9 ) are zero. So,\n\n= \u03b3 (1/2) [ (1) \u27e8+y| S_z |+y\u27e9 + (1) \u27e8-y| S_z |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nAs computed earlier, \u27e8+y| S_z |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/2 and \u27e8-y| S_z |-y\u27e9 = - \u0127/2.\n\nSo,\n\n= \u03b3 (1/2) [ (\u0127/2) + (- \u0127/2) ) ] = \u03b3 (1/2)(0) )= 0.\n\nWait, that's zero. But the question states that the average starts oscillating. So this can't be right. I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps I should consider that the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, which leads to precession around the Y-axis. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally with time.\n\nLet me think about the time evolution more carefully. The state |\u2191_z\u27e9 is a superposition of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, each with a phase factor that depends on time.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the time evolution using the matrix representation.\n\nThe Hamiltonian H = -\u03b3 B S_y = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.\n\nThe time evolution operator U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 )\n\nSubstituting H:\n\nU(t) = exp( -i (-\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y ) t / \u0127 )\n\n= exp( i \u03b3 B \u03c3_y t (t) / 2 )\n\nSo,\n\nU(t) = exp( i (\u03b3 B t/2 ) \u03c3_y )\n\nThe Pauli matrix \u03c3_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]].\n\nThe exponential of i \u03b8 \u03c3_y is given by:\n\nexp( i \u03b8 \u03c3_y ) = cos(\u03b8) I + i sin(\u03b8) \u03c3_y.\n\nSo, for \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t/2),\n\nU(t) = cos(\u03b3 B t/2) I + i sin(\u03b3 B t/2) \u03c3_y.\n\nThe initial state is |\u2191_z\u27e9 = [1; 0].\n\nSo, the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t) |\u2191_z\u27e9.\n\nLet's compute this:\n\nU(t) |\u2191_z\u27e9 = [ cos(\u03b8) I + i sin(\u03b8) \u03c3_y ] [1; 0 ]\n\n= cos(\u03b8) [1; 0 ] + i sin(\u03b8) \u03c3_y [1; 0 ]\n\nCompute \u03c3_y [1;0 ]:\n\n\u03c3_y [1;0 ] = [ 0*(-i) + (-i)*0, i*1 + 0*0 ]? Wait, no, \u03c3_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so when multiplied by [1; 0], it gives [ 0*1 + (-i)*0, i*1 + 0*0 ]^T = [0; i].\n\nSo,\n\nU(t) |\u2191_z\u27e9 = [ cos\u03b8, 0; i sin\u03b8, 0 ] [1; 0 ] \u2192 [ cos\u03b8 *1 + 0 * 0, ... ] \u2192 [ cos\u03b8; i sin\u03b8 ]\n\nSo, the state is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ cos\u03b8; i sin\u03b8 ], where \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t ) / 2.\n\nNow, S_z is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z, and \u03c3_z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n\nThe expectation value of S_z is:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| \u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nCompute \u27e8\u03c8(t)| \u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| = [ cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8 ]\n\n\u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ cos\u03b8, 0; 0, -1 ] [ cos\u03b8; i sin\u03b8 ] = [ cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 + 0, 0 * cos\u03b8 + (-1)(i sin\u03b8) ] = [ cos\u00b2\u03b8; -i sin\u03b8 ]\n\nThen,\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| \u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8 ] [ cos\u00b2\u03b8; -i sin\u03b8 ]\n\n= cos\u03b8 * cos\u00b2\u03b8 + (-i sin\u03b8) * (-i sin\u03b8 )\n\n= cos\u00b3\u03b8 + (-i)^2 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nBut (-i)^2 = (-i)(-i) = i^2 = -1.\n\nSo,\n\n= cos\u00b3\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWait, that's not right.

The \u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is [ cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8, (-i sin\u03b8) * (-i sin\u03b8) ]^T?\n\nWait, no. Let me compute \u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 correctly.\n\n\u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ [1,0],[0,-1] ] * [ cos\u03b8; i sin\u03b8 ]\n\n= [ 1 * cos\u03b8 + 0 * i sin\u03b8; 0 * cos\u03b8 + (-1) * i sin\u03b8 ]\n\n= [ cos\u03b8; -i sin\u03b8 ]\n\nThen,\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| \u03c3_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ cos\u03b8, -i sin\u03b8 ] [ cos\u03b8; -i sin\u03b8 ]\n\n= cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 + (-i sin\u03b8) * (-i sin\u03b8 )\n\n= cos\u00b2\u03b8 + (-i)(-i) sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut (-i)(-i) = i^2 = -1.\n\nSo,\n\n= cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWhich is cos(2\u03b8), since cos(2\u03b8) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 = cos(2\u03b8) \u2192 \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8).\n\nBut \u03b8 is (\u03b3 B t/2 ), so 2\u03b8 = \u03b3 B t.\n\nThus,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t )\n\nTherefore, the magnetic moment in the z-direction is:\n\n\u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t )\n\nBut wait, wait. The question states that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. So mu_z = gamma S_z. So the expectation value is gamma times the expectation value of S_z.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, let me check the units. gamma has units of (rad/s)/(Tesla), perhaps. B is in Tesla. So gamma * B has units of rad/s, which would make the argument of cos correct.\n\nThe average oscillates with frequency equal to gamma B.\n\nWait, but looking at the expression, the time dependence is cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The argument inside the cosine is (gamma B) t, which would imply a frequency of gamma B, because the general form is cos(omega t), where omega is the angular frequency.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is omega = gamma B.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, wait. I thought the time evolution involved a factor of theta = (gamma B t/2 ), and then in the expectation value, we had 2 theta, leading to gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option B: gamma B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because in the calculation, the expectation value \u27e8S_z\u27e9 oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), which has a frequency of gamma B.\n\nSo the average of mu_z oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the answer is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then turned off and replaced with a magnetic field of the same magnitude $B$ along the $+Y$ direction. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  \n   The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $| \\uparrow_z \\rangle$. The initial Hamiltonian is $H_{\\text{initial}} = -\\mu \\cdot B = -\\gamma B S_z$. When the magnetic field is switched to the $+Y$ direction, the new Hamiltonian becomes $H_{\\text{final}} = -\\gamma B S_y$.\n\n2. **Time Evolution**:  \n   After the field change, the system evolves under $H_{\\text{final}}$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\\pm \\hbar/2$. The initial state $| \\uparrow_z \\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$:\n   \\[\n   | \\uparrow_z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   The time evolution of the state is:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{i \\gamma B t / 2} |+y\\rangle + e^{-i \\gamma B t / 2} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Magnetic Moment in the $z$-Direction**:  \n   The magnetic moment in the $z$-direction is $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ is proportional to $\\langle S_z \\rangle$, which is computed as:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle.\n   \\]\n   Using the matrix representation of $S_z$ in the $y$-basis, the expectation value $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ oscillates as:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   Thus, the expectation value of $\\mu_z$ becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  \n   The oscillation of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ is governed by the term $\\cos(\\gamma B t)$, which has an angular frequency $\\omega = \\gamma B$. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is $\\gamma B$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options:\n- **Option A ($\\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not halved; the term $\\cos(\\gamma B t)$ directly gives the angular frequency $\\gamma B$.\n- **Option B ($\\gamma B$)**: Correct. The angular frequency of the oscillation is $\\gamma B$.\n- **Option C ($\\sqrt{2} \\gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ in the oscillation frequency.\n- **Option D ($\\gamma B / \\sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not reduced by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$.  \n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their spin aligned along certain axes, and the magnetic moment is related to that. The question involves the particle's magnetic moment oscillating when the magnetic field changes direction. Let me try to break this down.\n\nSo initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, right? Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think. So when the field is on, the particle's moment aligns with it because that's the lowest energy state. So the Sz component would be either +\u0127/2 or -\u0127/2, depending on the spin up or down.\n\nThen, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. Wait, so initially, the system was in an eigenstate of Sz. When the field is changed to Y, the magnetic field direction changes, so the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian would involve S_y because the magnetic moment is along Y now.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Oh, right, when you change the direction of the magnetic field, the energy levels change, and the state of the system might not be an eigenstate anymore. So it will start precessing, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nI remember that for a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field, the energy levels are given by E = -\u03bc\u00b7B. But since mu is proportional to spin, that becomes E = -gamma * B * S\u00b7n, where n is the direction of the field.\n\nWait, but when the field is along Z, the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies proportional to +1/2 and -1/2, respectively. When the field switches to Y, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the eigenstates will be |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe system was initially in an eigenstate of S_z. So when the field is suddenly changed, the state doesn't change instantaneously, but the Hamiltonian does. So the state becomes a superposition of the new eigenstates. This leads to time evolution and oscillations in observable quantities.\n\nThe average of the z-component of the moment, <Sz>, will oscillate because the state is a superposition of energy eigenstates. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy difference between the states.\n\nThe energy levels when the field is along Y are E_+ = (gamma B/2) and E_- = (-gamma B/2), because the spin states along Y would have eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2 for S_y, but wait, wait. Let me think about the Hamiltonian.\n\nThe magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z initially, but when the field is along Y, mu becomes gamma S_y. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. So H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, wait, the energy is H = -mu \u00b7 B, so in terms of spin, H = -gamma B S_z for the initial case. But for the new case, along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, no, wait. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, but the direction is along the field. So when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment is gamma S_y. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y.\n\nSo H = -gamma B S_y. Since S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, the energy levels are E = -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So E_plus is -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_minus is gamma B (\u0127/2)? Wait, wait. Wait, H is proportional to S_y, but the actual expression is H = -mu \u00b7 B, so mu is along Y, so mu = gamma S_y. So H = -gamma S_y B.\n\nWait, but spin is in units of \u0127/2. So S_y can be +\u0127/2 or -\u0127/2. So the energy would be H = -gamma B (S_y). So the energies are E = -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So E_plus is -gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_minus is gamma B (\u0127/2). Wait, that would mean the energy difference between the two states is E_plus - E_minus = (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) - (gamma B (\u0127/2)) ) = -gamma B \u0127. Hmm, wait, but wait. The energy levels are E_plus = (-gamma B) * (\u0127/2) and E_minus = (gamma B) * (\u0127/2). So the difference is E_plus - E_minus = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) ) = -gamma B \u0127. Wait, but I think the energy difference is the absolute value, so the frequency is determined by (E_plus - E_minus)/\u0127. \n\nWait, the energy difference is (E_plus - E_minus) = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) )= -gamma B \u0127. The absolute value is gamma B \u0127. So the energy difference is 2 gamma B (\u0127/2) * 2? Wait, perhaps I should compute it correctly.\n\nWait, E_plus is (-gamma B) * (S_y), which for S_y = + \u0127/2 gives E_plus = (-gamma B)( \u0127/2 ). Similarly, E_minus is (-gamma B)( - \u0127/2 ) = gamma B ( \u0127/2 ). So the energy levels are E_plus = - (gamma B \u0127)/2 and E_minus = (gamma B \u0127)/2. The difference is E_minus - E_plus = (gamma B \u0127/2 ) - ( - gamma B \u0127/2 ) ) = gamma B \u0127. So the energy difference is gamma B \u0127.\n\nWait, wait, but wait. Because when the spin is in state |+y>, the energy is E_plus = (-gamma B) * ( \u0127/2 ), and for |-y>, it's E_minus = (-gamma B) * ( - \u0127/2 ) = gamma B ( \u0127/2 ). So E_plus is lower than E_minus. The difference between them is E_minus - E_plus = (gamma B \u0127/2 ) - ( - gamma B \u0127/2 ) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe frequency of oscillation is given by (E_2 - E_1)/(hbar) ) / (2 pi) )? Wait, no. The time dependence comes from the energy levels. The time evolution for each eigenstate is multiplied by a phase factor of e^(-i E t / \u0127 ). So the transition frequency between states is (E2 - E1)/\u0127 divided by 2 pi. So the oscillation frequency is (E2 - E1)/(2 pi \u0127).\n\nWait, E2 - E1 is gamma B \u0127. So (gamma B \u0127) / (2 pi \u0127) ) = gamma B/(2 pi). Wait, but wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency. So what's the frequency here?\n\nAlternatively, the time dependence comes from the difference in phases. Let me think about the state after the change. The initial state is |+z>, which is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe time evolution of each component would be e^(-i E_plus t/\u0127 ) and e^(-i E_minus t/\u0127 ), respectively.\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\nc1 e^(-i E_plus t/\u0127 ) |+y> + c2 e^(-i E_minus t/\u0127 ) |-y>\n\nThe coefficients c1 and c2 are from the expansion of |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe expectation value of Sz will oscillate because of the interference terms. The frequency of these oscillations is determined by the energy difference between the two states.\n\nSo the frequency is (E_minus - E_plus)/\u0127 divided by 2 pi.\n\nWait, the energy difference is (E_minus - E_plus) = (gamma B \u0127/2 ) - ( - gamma B \u0127/2 ) ) = gamma B \u0127. So (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the oscillation frequency is given by (E2 - E1)/(2 pi \u0127) ) * \u0127? Wait, maybe I should think about the time dependence.\n\nThe time evolution of the state involves phases proportional to E t / \u0127. So when you compute the expectation value of Sz, you'll have terms like e^{i (E_+ - E_- ) t / \u0127 } and its complex conjugate. The oscillation frequency is (E_+ - E_- ) / (2 pi \u0127) ), but wait, E_+ and E_- are the energies of the states. Let me get this right.\n\nThe energy difference is \u0394E = E_+ - E_-? No, earlier calculation said E_plus is -gamma B \u0127/2, E_minus is gamma B \u0127/2. So \u0394E = E_plus - E_minus = (-gamma B \u0127/2 ) - (gamma B \u0127/2 ) = - gamma B \u0127. The absolute value is gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is |\u0394E| / (2 pi \u0127 ) ) = (gamma B \u0127) / (2 pi \u0127 ) ) = gamma B/(2 pi).\n\nWait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency. So the frequency is gamma B/(2 pi)? But the options don't have that. Hmm, the options are in terms of gamma B multiplied by factors like 1/2, sqrt(2), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. When the magnetic field changes to Y, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the state will now be a superposition of |+y> and |-y> states.\n\nThe time evolution will cause the state to evolve as:\n\n|psi(t)> = c1 e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127 } |+y> + c2 e^{-i E_- t/\u0127 } |-y>\n\nThe expectation value of Sz, <Sz>, will be the sum of the components. Let me compute <Sz>:\n\n<Sz> = c1^* c1 < +y | S_z | +y > e^{-i (E_+ - E_+ ) t/\u0127 } + c1^* c2^* < +y | S_z | -y > e^{i (E_+ - E_- ) t/\u0127 } + c2^* c1 < -y | S_z | +y > e^{i (E_- - E_+ ) t/\u0127 } + c2^* c2 < -y | S_z | -y > e^{-i (E_- - E_- ) t/\u0127 }\n\nBut wait, S_z for |+y> and |-y> states. The matrix elements of S_z in the S_y basis can be found.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the time dependence by considering the transition probabilities and the expectation value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the time evolution operator. But maybe there's a simpler approach.\n\nWait, another approach: the system undergoes a spin precession when the magnetic field changes. The oscillation frequency is related to the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is given by omega = gamma B. But wait, that's for a magnetic field along the same axis as the spin. But in this case, the field is changing direction, so perhaps the frequency is different.\n\nWait, no, because in the initial state, the spin is along Z. After the field is along Y, the spin starts precessing around Y. So the precession frequency would determine the oscillation of <Sz>.\n\nHmm, perhaps the oscillation frequency is the same as the Larmor frequency divided by sqrt(2) or something like that.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the energy levels again. The energy levels when the field is along Y are E_+ = (gamma B) * (\u0127/2), and E_- = (-gamma B) * (\u0127/2), because the magnetic moment is along Y. Wait, no, earlier I thought H = -gamma B S_y. So E_+ = -gamma B ( \u0127/2 ), and E_- = gamma B ( \u0127/2 ). So the energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the energy difference is gamma B \u0127. The oscillation frequency is (E_- - E_+ ) / (2 pi \u0127 ) ) = (gamma B \u0127 )/(2 pi \u0127 ) ) = gamma B/(2 pi).\n\nWait, but wait, the question is asking for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component. So the frequency is gamma B/(2 pi). But looking at the options, the options are gamma B multiplied by factors, not involving 2 pi. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Hamiltonian. Let me re-examine that. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_y. The energy is H = - mu \u00b7 B, so H = - gamma B S_y. So H is proportional to S_y.\n\nBut the spin matrices: S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the energies are E = - gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2 ). So E_plus = - gamma B ( \u0127/2 ), and E_minus = gamma B ( \u0127/2 ). The energy difference is E_minus - E_plus = gamma B ( \u0127/2 ) - ( - gamma B ( \u0127/2 ) ) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the frequency of oscillation is (E_minus - E_plus )/(2 pi \u0127 ) ) = (gamma B \u0127 )/(2 pi \u0127 ) ) = gamma B/(2 pi). But the options don't have 2 pi, so maybe I'm getting the wrong approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the time dependence in the expectation value. The initial state is |+z>. When the field is turned to Y, the state can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2). Because the states |+y> and |-y> can be written in terms of |+z> and |-z> as follows:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the initial state after the field change is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nThe time evolution of each component is multiplied by e^(-i E t / \u0127 ). So the state at time t is:\n\n( e^(-i E_plus t/\u0127 ) |+y> + e^(-i E_minus t/\u0127 ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nE_plus is -gamma B ( \u0127/2 ), E_minus is gamma B ( \u0127/2 ).\n\nSo substituting E_plus and E_minus:\n\n( e^(-i (-gamma B (\u0127/2 )) t/\u0127 ) |+y> + e^(-i (gamma B (\u0127/2 )) t/\u0127 ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\ne^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, to compute the expectation value of Sz, which is the spin-z component.\n\nSz is the operator, and the expectation value is <psi(t)| Sz | psi(t) >.\n\nExpressed in the |+y> and |-y> basis, what's Sz?\n\nThe matrix for Sz in the S_y basis. Let's recall that S_z and S_y don't commute. The matrix representation of Sz in the |+y>, |-y> basis is:\n\nS_z = (\u0127/2 ) [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think. In the |+y> and |-y> basis, the S_z matrix is diagonal? Or is it off-diagonal?\n\nActually, in the S_z basis, S_y is represented by a matrix with off-diagonal elements. But when changing basis, it's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <Sz> directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>, then compute the expectation value.\n\nWait, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\nSimilarly, |-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n[ e^{i gamma B t/2 } (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nWait, no, because the state is [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } |-y> ] / sqrt(2) )\n\nSo substituting |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n= [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nFactor out 1/sqrt(2):\n\n= [ (|+z> + |-z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2 } + (|+z> - |-z> ) e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) )\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n[ (|+z> + |-z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2 } + (|+z> - |-z> ) e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ) ] / 2\n\nExpanding the terms:\n\n= [ (|+z> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + |-z> e^{i gamma B t/2 }) + |+z> e^{-i gamma B t/2 } - |-z> e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ) ] / 2\n\nGrouping terms:\n\n= [ |+z> (e^{i gamma B t/2 } + e^{-i gamma B t/2 }) + |-z> (e^{i gamma B t/2 } - e^{-i gamma B t/2 }) ) ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula: e^{i\u03b8} + e^{-i\u03b8} = 2 cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8} = 2i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ |+z> (2 cos(gamma B t/2 )) + |-z> (2i sin(gamma B t/2 )) ) ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ |+z> cos(gamma B t/2 ) + i |-z> sin(gamma B t/2 ) ]\n\nSo the state is:\n\n|psi(t)> = cos( gamma B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |-z>\n\nNow, the expectation value of Sz is <Sz> = <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>\n\nSince Sz |+z> = (\u0127/2 ) |+z>, and Sz |-z> = (-\u0127/2 ) |-z>.\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = [ cos( gamma B t/2 ) ]^2 ( \u0127/2 ) + [ i sin( gamma B t/2 ) ]^2 ( - \u0127/2 )\n\nWait, let's compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, write |psi(t)> as:\n\na |+z> + b |-z>, where a = cos(theta), b = i sin(theta), and theta = gamma B t/2.\n\nThen, <Sz> = a^* a (\u0127/2) + b^* b ( - \u0127/2 )\n\nCompute a^* a: |a|^2 = cos^2(theta)\n\nb^* b: |b|^2 = |i sin(theta)|^2 = sin^2(theta)\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = cos^2(theta) (\u0127/2 ) + sin^2(theta) ( - \u0127/2 )\n\nFactor out \u0127/2:\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity: cos(2 theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta)\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = (\u0127/2 ) cos(2 theta )\n\nSubstituting theta = gamma B t/2:\n\n= (\u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the time dependence of <Sz> is cos(gamma B t), which oscillates at a frequency of gamma B / (2 pi ) * (2 pi ) )?\n\nWait, no. The cosine function has a frequency f = (gamma B)/(2 pi ), because cos(2 pi f t ) = cos(omega t ), where omega = 2 pi f. So in our case, the argument is gamma B t, so omega = gamma B. Therefore, f = omega/(2 pi ) = gamma B/(2 pi ).\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the oscillation frequency, which is f = gamma B/(2 pi ). But none of the options match that. The options are in terms of gamma B multiplied by factors like 1/sqrt(2), etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the state |psi(t)>, I have <Sz> = (\u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation is at frequency gamma B, because the argument is gamma B t. Because the cosine function's argument is (gamma B ) t, which is omega t, where omega is gamma B.\n\nWait, wait, that's right! Because the general form is cos(omega t ), so omega is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, wait, in our expression, it's cos( gamma B t ), which implies the angular frequency omega is gamma B. So the frequency f is omega/(2 pi ) = gamma B/(2 pi ). But the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is gamma B/(2 pi ), but the options don't include that.\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nNone of these have 2 pi in them, which suggests I might have made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Rabi frequency. When you have a spin in a magnetic field oscillating between states, the Rabi frequency is the oscillation frequency of the expectation value. The Rabi frequency is given by Omega = gamma B.\n\nWait, but in this case, the initial state is |+z>, and the field is along Y. The Rabi oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency would be gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut earlier I thought the frequency was gamma B/(2 pi ), but perhaps I was confusing angular frequency with regular frequency. Let me re-express.\n\nThe angular frequency is omega = gamma B. So the regular frequency f is omega/(2 pi ) = gamma B/(2 pi ). But the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is usually the regular frequency. But the options don't have that term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating <Sz>. Let me re-express the <Sz> in terms of the energy difference.\n\nWait, another approach: The time evolution leads to the expectation value oscillating with a frequency equal to the energy difference divided by hbar. Since the energy difference is gamma B \u0127, the angular frequency is (gamma B \u0127 ) / \u0127 = gamma B. So the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut the question is about the frequency, which is the number of cycles per second, so f = gamma B / (2 pi ). But that's not an option here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the angular frequency as the oscillation frequency. In physics, sometimes people refer to the angular frequency as the frequency, especially in quantum mechanics contexts.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is its oscillation frequency?\" It doesn't specify whether it's angular frequency or regular frequency.\n\nIn my earlier calculation, <Sz> oscillates as cos(gamma B t ), which implies the angular frequency is gamma B. So the answer would be gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, in the <Sz> expression, it's (\u0127/2 ) cos(gamma B t ), so the oscillation has an angular frequency of gamma B. So the frequency would be gamma B / (2 pi ), but if the question is asking for the angular frequency, then the answer is gamma B.\n\nBut the options don't have 2 pi. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial setup is wrong. Let me think about the system again. Initially, the spin is aligned with the Z field, so it's in |+z>. Then the field is applied along Y. The Hamiltonian becomes H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nThe energy levels are E = \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2 ). So the energy difference is gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe time evolution of the state leads to oscillations in the expectation value with a frequency given by the energy difference divided by hbar, which is (gamma B \u0127 )/( \u0127 ) ) = gamma B. So the angular frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nSo the answer should be option B, gamma*B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment after the magnetic field is suddenly changed from the +Z direction to the +Y direction, we analyze the system as follows:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The particle is in a spin-1/2 state with the magnetic field along +Z.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their spin aligned along certain axes, and the magnetic moment is related to that. The question involves the particle's magnetic moment oscillating when the magnetic field changes direction. Let me try to break this down.\n\nSo initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, right? Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think. So when the field is on, the particle's moment aligns with it because that's the lowest energy state. So the Sz component would be either +\u0127/2 or -\u0127/2, depending on the spin up or down.\n\nThen, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. Wait, so initially, the system was in an eigenstate of Sz. When the field is changed to Y, the magnetic field direction changes, so the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian would involve S_y because the magnetic moment is along Y now.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Oh, right, when you change the direction of the magnetic field, the energy levels change, and the state of the system might not be an eigenstate anymore. So it will start precessing, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nI remember that for a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field, the energy levels are given by E = -\u03bc\u00b7B. But since mu is proportional to spin, that becomes E = -gamma * B * S\u00b7n, where n is the direction of the field.\n\nWait, but when the field is along Z, the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies proportional to +1/2 and -1/2, respectively. When the field switches to Y, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the eigenstates will be |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe system was initially in an eigenstate of S_z. So when the field is suddenly changed, the state doesn't change instantaneously, but the Hamiltonian does. So the state becomes a superposition of the new eigenstates. This leads to time evolution and oscillations in observable quantities.\n\nThe average of the z-component of the moment, <Sz>, will oscillate because the state is a superposition of energy eigenstates. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy difference between the states.\n\nThe energy levels when the field is along Y are E_+ = (gamma B/2) and E_- = (-gamma B/2), because the spin states along Y would have eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2 for S_y, but wait, wait. Let me think about the Hamiltonian.\n\nThe magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z initially, but when the field is along Y, mu becomes gamma S_y. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. So H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, wait, the energy is H = -mu \u00b7 B, so in terms of spin, H = -gamma B S_z for the initial case. But for the new case, along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, no, wait. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, but the direction is along the field. So when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment is gamma S_y. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y.\n\nSo H = -gamma B S_y. Since S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, the energy levels are E = -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So E_plus is -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_minus is gamma B (\u0127/2)? Wait, wait. Wait, H is proportional to S_y, but the actual expression is H = -mu \u00b7 B, so mu is along Y, so mu = gamma S_y. So H = -gamma S_y B.\n\nWait, but spin is in units of \u0127/2. So S_y can be +\u0127/2 or -\u0127/2. So the energy would be H = -gamma B (S_y). So the energies are E = -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So E_plus is -gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_minus is gamma B (\u0127/2). Wait, that would mean the energy difference between the two states is E_plus - E_minus = (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) - (gamma B (\u0127/2)) ) = -gamma B \u0127. Hmm, wait, but wait. The energy levels are E_plus = (-gamma B) * (\u0127/2) and E_minus = (gamma B) * (\u0127/2). So the difference is E_plus - E_minus = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) ) = -gamma B \u0127. Wait, but I think the energy difference is the absolute value, so the frequency is determined by (E_plus - E_minus)/\u0127. \n\nWait, the energy difference is (E_plus - E_minus) = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) )= -gamma B \u0127. The absolute value is gamma B \u0127. So the energy difference is 2 gamma B (\u0127/2) * 2? Wait, perhaps I should compute it correctly.\n\nWait, E_plus is (-gamma B) * (S_y), which for S_y = + \u0127/2 gives E_plus = (-gamma B)( \u0127/2 ). Similarly, E_minus is (-gamma B)( - \u0127/2 ) = gamma B ( \u0127/2 ). So the energy levels are E_plus = - (gamma B \u0127)/2 and E_minus = (gamma B \u0127)/2. The difference is E_minus - E_plus = (gamma B \u0127/2 ) - ( - gamma B \u0127/2 ) ) = gamma B \u0127. So the energy difference is gamma B \u0127.\n\nWait, wait, but wait. Because when the spin is in state |+y>, the energy is E_plus = (-gamma B) * ( \u0127/2 ), and for |-y>, it's E_minus = (-gamma B) * ( - \u0127/2 ) = gamma B ( \u0127/2 ). So E_plus is lower than E_minus. The difference between them is E_minus - E_plus = (gamma B \u0127/2 ) - ( - gamma B \u0127/2 ) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe frequency of oscillation is given by (E_2 - E_1)/(hbar) ) / (2 pi) )? Wait, no. The time dependence comes from the energy levels. The time evolution for each eigenstate is multiplied by a phase factor of e^(-i E t / \u0127 ). So the transition frequency between states is (E2 - E1)/\u0127 divided by 2 pi. So the oscillation frequency is (E2 - E1)/(2 pi \u0127).\n\nWait, E2 - E1 is gamma B \u0127. So (gamma B \u0127) / (2 pi \u0127) ) = gamma B/(2 pi). Wait, but wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency. So what's the frequency here?\n\nAlternatively, the time dependence comes from the difference in phases. Let me think about the state after the change. The initial state is |+z>, which is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe time evolution of each component would be e^(-i E_plus t/\u0127 ) and e^(-i E_minus t/\u0127 ), respectively.\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\nc1 e^(-i E_plus t/\u0127 ) |+y> + c2 e^(-i E_minus t/\u0127 ) |-y>\n\nThe coefficients c1 and c2 are from the expansion of |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe expectation value of Sz will oscillate because of the interference terms. The frequency of these oscillations is determined by the energy difference between the two states.\n\nSo the frequency is (E_minus - E_plus)/\u0127 divided by 2 pi.\n\nWait, the energy difference is (E_minus - E_plus) = (gamma B \u0127/2 ) - ( - gamma B \u0127/2 ) ) = gamma B \u0127. So (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the oscillation frequency is given by (E2 - E1)/(2 pi \u0127) ) * \u0127? Wait, maybe I should think about the time dependence.\n\nThe time evolution of the state involves phases proportional to E t / \u0127. So when you compute the expectation value of Sz, you'll have terms like e^{i (E_+ - E_- ) t / \u0127 } and its complex conjugate. The oscillation frequency is (E_+ - E_- ) / (2 pi \u0127) ), but wait, E_+ and E_- are the energies of the states. Let me get this right.\n\nThe energy difference is \u0394E = E_+ - E_-? No, earlier calculation said E_plus is -gamma B \u0127/2, E_minus is gamma B \u0127/2. So \u0394E = E_plus - E_minus = (-gamma B \u0127/2 ) - (gamma B \u0127/2 ) = - gamma B \u0127. The absolute value is gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is |\u0394E| / (2 pi \u0127 ) ) = (gamma B \u0127) / (2 pi \u0127 ) ) = gamma B/(2 pi).\n\nWait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency. So the frequency is gamma B/(2 pi)? But the options don't have that. Hmm, the options are in terms of gamma B multiplied by factors like 1/2, sqrt(2), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. When the magnetic field changes to Y, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the state will now be a superposition of |+y> and |-y> states.\n\nThe time evolution will cause the state to evolve as:\n\n|psi(t)> = c1 e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127 } |+y> + c2 e^{-i E_- t/\u0127 } |-y>\n\nThe expectation value of Sz, <Sz>, will be the sum of the components. Let me compute <Sz>:\n\n<Sz> = c1^* c1 < +y | S_z | +y > e^{-i (E_+ - E_+ ) t/\u0127 } + c1^* c2^* < +y | S_z | -y > e^{i (E_+ - E_- ) t/\u0127 } + c2^* c1 < -y | S_z | +y > e^{i (E_- - E_+ ) t/\u0127 } + c2^* c2 < -y | S_z | -y > e^{-i (E_- - E_- ) t/\u0127 }\n\nBut wait, S_z for |+y> and |-y> states. The matrix elements of S_z in the S_y basis can be found.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the time dependence by considering the transition probabilities and the expectation value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the time evolution operator. But maybe there's a simpler approach.\n\nWait, another approach: the system undergoes a spin precession when the magnetic field changes. The oscillation frequency is related to the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is given by omega = gamma B. But wait, that's for a magnetic field along the same axis as the spin. But in this case, the field is changing direction, so perhaps the frequency is different.\n\nWait, no, because in the initial state, the spin is along Z. After the field is along Y, the spin starts precessing around Y. So the precession frequency would determine the oscillation of <Sz>.\n\nHmm, perhaps the oscillation frequency is the same as the Larmor frequency divided by sqrt(2) or something like that.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the energy levels again. The energy levels when the field is along Y are E_+ = (gamma B) * (\u0127/2), and E_- = (-gamma B) * (\u0127/2), because the magnetic moment is along Y. Wait, no, earlier I thought H = -gamma B S_y. So E_+ = -gamma B ( \u0127/2 ), and E_- = gamma B ( \u0127/2 ). So the energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the energy difference is gamma B \u0127. The oscillation frequency is (E_- - E_+ ) / (2 pi \u0127 ) ) = (gamma B \u0127 )/(2 pi \u0127 ) ) = gamma B/(2 pi).\n\nWait, but wait, the question is asking for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component. So the frequency is gamma B/(2 pi). But looking at the options, the options are gamma B multiplied by factors, not involving 2 pi. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Hamiltonian. Let me re-examine that. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_y. The energy is H = - mu \u00b7 B, so H = - gamma B S_y. So H is proportional to S_y.\n\nBut the spin matrices: S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the energies are E = - gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2 ). So E_plus = - gamma B ( \u0127/2 ), and E_minus = gamma B ( \u0127/2 ). The energy difference is E_minus - E_plus = gamma B ( \u0127/2 ) - ( - gamma B ( \u0127/2 ) ) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the frequency of oscillation is (E_minus - E_plus )/(2 pi \u0127 ) ) = (gamma B \u0127 )/(2 pi \u0127 ) ) = gamma B/(2 pi). But the options don't have 2 pi, so maybe I'm getting the wrong approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the time dependence in the expectation value. The initial state is |+z>. When the field is turned to Y, the state can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2). Because the states |+y> and |-y> can be written in terms of |+z> and |-z> as follows:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the initial state after the field change is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nThe time evolution of each component is multiplied by e^(-i E t / \u0127 ). So the state at time t is:\n\n( e^(-i E_plus t/\u0127 ) |+y> + e^(-i E_minus t/\u0127 ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nE_plus is -gamma B ( \u0127/2 ), E_minus is gamma B ( \u0127/2 ).\n\nSo substituting E_plus and E_minus:\n\n( e^(-i (-gamma B (\u0127/2 )) t/\u0127 ) |+y> + e^(-i (gamma B (\u0127/2 )) t/\u0127 ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\ne^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, to compute the expectation value of Sz, which is the spin-z component.\n\nSz is the operator, and the expectation value is <psi(t)| Sz | psi(t) >.\n\nExpressed in the |+y> and |-y> basis, what's Sz?\n\nThe matrix for Sz in the S_y basis. Let's recall that S_z and S_y don't commute. The matrix representation of Sz in the |+y>, |-y> basis is:\n\nS_z = (\u0127/2 ) [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think. In the |+y> and |-y> basis, the S_z matrix is diagonal? Or is it off-diagonal?\n\nActually, in the S_z basis, S_y is represented by a matrix with off-diagonal elements. But when changing basis, it's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <Sz> directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>, then compute the expectation value.\n\nWait, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\nSimilarly, |-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n[ e^{i gamma B t/2 } (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nWait, no, because the state is [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } |-y> ] / sqrt(2) )\n\nSo substituting |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n= [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nFactor out 1/sqrt(2):\n\n= [ (|+z> + |-z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2 } + (|+z> - |-z> ) e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) )\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n[ (|+z> + |-z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2 } + (|+z> - |-z> ) e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ) ] / 2\n\nExpanding the terms:\n\n= [ (|+z> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + |-z> e^{i gamma B t/2 }) + |+z> e^{-i gamma B t/2 } - |-z> e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ) ] / 2\n\nGrouping terms:\n\n= [ |+z> (e^{i gamma B t/2 } + e^{-i gamma B t/2 }) + |-z> (e^{i gamma B t/2 } - e^{-i gamma B t/2 }) ) ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula: e^{i\u03b8} + e^{-i\u03b8} = 2 cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8} = 2i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ |+z> (2 cos(gamma B t/2 )) + |-z> (2i sin(gamma B t/2 )) ) ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ |+z> cos(gamma B t/2 ) + i |-z> sin(gamma B t/2 ) ]\n\nSo the state is:\n\n|psi(t)> = cos( gamma B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |-z>\n\nNow, the expectation value of Sz is <Sz> = <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>\n\nSince Sz |+z> = (\u0127/2 ) |+z>, and Sz |-z> = (-\u0127/2 ) |-z>.\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = [ cos( gamma B t/2 ) ]^2 ( \u0127/2 ) + [ i sin( gamma B t/2 ) ]^2 ( - \u0127/2 )\n\nWait, let's compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, write |psi(t)> as:\n\na |+z> + b |-z>, where a = cos(theta), b = i sin(theta), and theta = gamma B t/2.\n\nThen, <Sz> = a^* a (\u0127/2) + b^* b ( - \u0127/2 )\n\nCompute a^* a: |a|^2 = cos^2(theta)\n\nb^* b: |b|^2 = |i sin(theta)|^2 = sin^2(theta)\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = cos^2(theta) (\u0127/2 ) + sin^2(theta) ( - \u0127/2 )\n\nFactor out \u0127/2:\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity: cos(2 theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta)\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = (\u0127/2 ) cos(2 theta )\n\nSubstituting theta = gamma B t/2:\n\n= (\u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the time dependence of <Sz> is cos(gamma B t), which oscillates at a frequency of gamma B / (2 pi ) * (2 pi ) )?\n\nWait, no. The cosine function has a frequency f = (gamma B)/(2 pi ), because cos(2 pi f t ) = cos(omega t ), where omega = 2 pi f. So in our case, the argument is gamma B t, so omega = gamma B. Therefore, f = omega/(2 pi ) = gamma B/(2 pi ).\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the oscillation frequency, which is f = gamma B/(2 pi ). But none of the options match that. The options are in terms of gamma B multiplied by factors like 1/sqrt(2), etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the state |psi(t)>, I have <Sz> = (\u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation is at frequency gamma B, because the argument is gamma B t. Because the cosine function's argument is (gamma B ) t, which is omega t, where omega is gamma B.\n\nWait, wait, that's right! Because the general form is cos(omega t ), so omega is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, wait, in our expression, it's cos( gamma B t ), which implies the angular frequency omega is gamma B. So the frequency f is omega/(2 pi ) = gamma B/(2 pi ). But the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is gamma B/(2 pi ), but the options don't include that.\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nNone of these have 2 pi in them, which suggests I might have made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Rabi frequency. When you have a spin in a magnetic field oscillating between states, the Rabi frequency is the oscillation frequency of the expectation value. The Rabi frequency is given by Omega = gamma B.\n\nWait, but in this case, the initial state is |+z>, and the field is along Y. The Rabi oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency would be gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut earlier I thought the frequency was gamma B/(2 pi ), but perhaps I was confusing angular frequency with regular frequency. Let me re-express.\n\nThe angular frequency is omega = gamma B. So the regular frequency f is omega/(2 pi ) = gamma B/(2 pi ). But the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is usually the regular frequency. But the options don't have that term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating <Sz>. Let me re-express the <Sz> in terms of the energy difference.\n\nWait, another approach: The time evolution leads to the expectation value oscillating with a frequency equal to the energy difference divided by hbar. Since the energy difference is gamma B \u0127, the angular frequency is (gamma B \u0127 ) / \u0127 = gamma B. So the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut the question is about the frequency, which is the number of cycles per second, so f = gamma B / (2 pi ). But that's not an option here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the angular frequency as the oscillation frequency. In physics, sometimes people refer to the angular frequency as the frequency, especially in quantum mechanics contexts.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is its oscillation frequency?\" It doesn't specify whether it's angular frequency or regular frequency.\n\nIn my earlier calculation, <Sz> oscillates as cos(gamma B t ), which implies the angular frequency is gamma B. So the answer would be gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, in the <Sz> expression, it's (\u0127/2 ) cos(gamma B t ), so the oscillation has an angular frequency of gamma B. So the frequency would be gamma B / (2 pi ), but if the question is asking for the angular frequency, then the answer is gamma B.\n\nBut the options don't have 2 pi. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial setup is wrong. Let me think about the system again. Initially, the spin is aligned with the Z field, so it's in |+z>. Then the field is applied along Y. The Hamiltonian becomes H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nThe energy levels are E = \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2 ). So the energy difference is gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe time evolution of the state leads to oscillations in the expectation value with a frequency given by the energy difference divided by hbar, which is (gamma B \u0127 )/( \u0127 ) ) = gamma B. So the angular frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nSo the answer should be option B, gamma*B.\n\n\nTo determine the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment after the magnetic field is suddenly changed from the +Z direction to the +Y direction, we analyze the system as follows:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The particle is in a spin-1/2 state with the magnetic field along +Z. The magnetic moment is aligned with the field, and the system is in an eigenstate of \\( S_z \\).\n\n2. **Field Change**: When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes to \\( H = -\\gamma B S_y \\), where \\( \\gamma \\) is the gyromagnetic ratio, \\( B \\) is the magnetic field strength, and \\( S_y \\) is the spin operator along the Y-axis.\n\n3. **Energy Levels**: The eigenvalues of \\( S_y \\) are \\( \\pm \\hbar/2 \\), so the energy levels become:\n   \\[\n   E_+ = -\\gamma B \\frac{\\hbar}{2}, \\quad E_- = \\gamma B \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.\n   \\]\n   The energy difference between the two states is:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta E = E_- - E_+ = \\gamma B \\hbar.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of the expectation value of \\( S_z \\) arises due to the time-dependent superposition of the eigenstates of \\( S_y \\). The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference \\( \\Delta E \\). The angular frequency is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\omega = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\hbar} = \\gamma B.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Interpretation of the Question**: The problem asks for the oscillation frequency. While the angular frequency is \\( \\omega = \\gamma B \\), the term \"oscillation frequency\" typically refers to the angular frequency in quantum mechanics contexts. Thus, the oscillation frequency is \\( \\gamma B \\).\n\n6. **Options Analysis**:\n   - **A) \\( \\gamma B / 2 \\)**: Incorrect, as this does not match the derived frequency.\n   - **B) \\( \\gamma B \\)**: Correct, as this matches the angular frequency derived from the energy difference.\n   - **C) \\( \\sqrt{2} \\gamma B \\)**: Incorrect, as this introduces an unnecessary factor of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\).\n   - **D) \\( \\gamma B / \\sqrt{2} \\)**: Incorrect, as this also introduces an extraneous factor.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B**, \\( \\gamma B \\).\n\nAnswer: B",
