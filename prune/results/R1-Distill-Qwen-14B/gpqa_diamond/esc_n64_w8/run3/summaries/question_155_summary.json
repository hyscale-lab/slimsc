      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about uncertainty in the operator P_z. I remember that the uncertainty principle involves calculating the expectation values and then finding the variance. \n\nThe question says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty \u0394P_z, which is the standard deviation of P_z in this state.\n\nWait, right. The uncertainty \u0394P_z is the square root of the variance. The variance is \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 minus \u27e8P_z\u27e9 squared. But since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, I don't think it's an eigenstate of P_z. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 might not be zero, but wait, actually, I need to compute the expectation values properly.\n\nFirst, let me write down the state vector. It's a column vector: \u03c8 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me check if this is normalized. The sum of squares is (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 makes 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.\n\nNext, I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9. That's \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. Because P_z is a diagonal matrix, it's easier to compute. Looking at the matrix for P_z: it's diagonal with entries \u0127, 0, -\u0127. So the diagonal elements are (\u0127, 0, -\u0127).\n\nSo when I multiply P_z by the state vector \u03c8, each component is just the product of the diagonal element and the corresponding component of \u03c8.\n\nWait, but to compute the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I should calculate \u03c8\u2020 (P_z \u03c8). Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element, but multiplied by the conjugate of the component. Wait, no. Wait, the state is a column vector, and P_z is diagonal. So P_z \u03c8 is a vector where each component is the diagonal element times the component of \u03c8.\n\nSo P_z \u03c8 would be [ \u0127*(-1/2), 0*(1/\u221a2), (-\u0127)*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ]^T.\n\nThen \u03c8\u2020 is the conjugate transpose, which for real components is just the transpose. So \u03c8\u2020 is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ].\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = \u03c8\u2020 (P_z \u03c8) = [ (-1/2)(-\u0127/2) ) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(\u0127/2) ].\n\nCalculating each term: (-1/2)(-\u0127/2) is \u0127/4. The second term is zero. The third term is (-1/2)(\u0127/2) which is -\u0127/4. Adding them together: \u0127/4 - \u0127/4 = 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero. Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero.\n\nNow, I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Because the variance is \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2. Since \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero, the variance is just \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9.\n\nSo to find \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9, I can compute \u03c8\u2020 (P_z\u00b2 \u03c8). Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So the diagonal elements are (\u0127)^2, 0^2, (-\u0127)^2, which are \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo P_z squared times \u03c8 would be [ \u0127\u00b2*(-1/2), 0, \u0127\u00b2*(-1/2) ]^T. Wait no, wait. Let me think. The matrix P_z\u00b2 is diag(\u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2). So when you multiply by \u03c8, each component is the diagonal element multiplied by \u03c8's component.\n\nSo P_z\u00b2 \u03c8 = [ (\u0127\u00b2)(-1/2), 0*(1/\u221a2), (\u0127\u00b2)(-1/2) ]^T = [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ]^T.\n\nThen \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is \u03c8\u2020 (P_z\u00b2 \u03c8) = [ (-1/2)(-\u0127\u00b2/2) ) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(-\u0127\u00b2/2) ].\n\nCalculating each term: (-1/2)(-\u0127\u00b2/2) is (\u0127\u00b2/4), and the third term is also (\u0127\u00b2/4). The middle term is zero. So adding them gives \u0127\u00b2/4 + \u0127\u00b2/4 = \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nSo the variance is \u0127\u00b2/2. The uncertainty \u0394P_z is the square root of the variance, so sqrt(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). Wait, that's option B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recheck the calculations.\n\nWait, the state vector is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T. When I compute P_z \u03c8, each component is:\n\nFirst component: \u0127 * (-1/2) = -\u0127/2.\n\nSecond component: 0 * (1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nThird component: (-\u0127) * (-1/2) = \u0127/2.\n\nThen, when I take \u03c8\u2020 (P_z \u03c8), each component of \u03c8 is multiplied by the corresponding component of P_z \u03c8. So:\n\n(-1/2) * (-\u0127/2) = \u0127/4.\n\n(1/\u221a2) * 0 = 0.\n\n(-1/2) * (\u0127/2) = -\u0127/4.\n\nAdding these gives 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is indeed zero.\n\nFor \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9, P_z squared is diag(\u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2). So each component of P_z\u00b2 \u03c8 is:\n\nFirst: \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2) = -\u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nSecond: 0 * (1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nThird: \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2) = -\u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait a second, no. Because P_z squared is (diag(\u0127, 0, -\u0127)) squared, so each diagonal element is squared. So, the diagonal elements are (\u0127)^2, 0^2, (-\u0127)^2, which are all \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo when I multiply P_z squared by \u03c8, each component is:\n\nFirst: \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2) = -\u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nSecond: 0 * (1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nThird: \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2) = -\u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the third diagonal element is (-\u0127), so when you square it, it's \u0127\u00b2, correct. So P_z squared is diag(\u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2).\n\nSo P_z\u00b2 \u03c8 would be [ \u0127\u00b2*(-1/2), 0*(1/\u221a2), \u0127\u00b2*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ]^T.\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ].\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n(-1/2) * (-\u0127\u00b2/2) = (1/2)(1/2) \u0127\u00b2 = \u0127\u00b2/4.\n\n(1/\u221a2) * 0 = 0.\n\n(-1/2) * (-\u0127\u00b2/2) = (1/2)(1/2) \u0127\u00b2 = \u0127\u00b2/4.\n\nSumming them: \u0127\u00b2/4 + \u0127\u00b2/4 = \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nSo variance is \u0127\u00b2/2, uncertainty is sqrt(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). Which is option B.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2), which is correct. So the answer should be option B.\n",

To compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle$, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger P_z \\psi.\n\\]\n\nSince $P_z$ is diagonal, $P_z \\psi$ is:\n\n\\[\nP_z \\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\\\ 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\hbar \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTaking the inner product $\\psi^\\dagger (P_z \\psi)$:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot 0 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$\nThe matrix $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is diagonal with elements $(\\hbar^2, 0, \\hbar^2)$. To compute $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger P_z^2 \\psi.\n\\]\n\nSince $P_z^2$ is diagonal, $P_z^2 \\psi$ is:\n\n\\[\nP_z^2 \\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\\\ 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTaking the inner product $\\psi^\\dagger (P_z^2 \\psi)$:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot 0 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\right).\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute $\\Delta P_z$\nThe variance is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Var}(P_z) = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe uncertainty is the square root of the variance:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it step by step.\n\nThe question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the standard deviation, which involves the expectation values of the operator and its square.\n\nFirst, let me recap what I know. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the uncertainties in two incompatible observables (like P_x and P_z) is at least half the absolute value of their commutator. But since the question is directly asking for \u0394P_z, maybe I don't need the full uncertainty principle approach. Instead, I think I can calculate it using the expectation values.\n\nSo, the formula for the uncertainty \u0394P_z is the square root of the expectation of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation of P_z. That is, \u0394P_z = sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2).\n\nBut wait, since the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, which is a different operator, the expectation values might be tricky. Because in an eigenstate of one operator, the expectation of another doesn't necessarily have a simple form. But I think I can compute it directly using the given state vector.\n\nThe given state is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's denote this as |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nSo, to find \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I need to compute \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. Similarly, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is \u03c8\u2020 P_z\u00b2 \u03c8.\n\nWait, but wait. P_z is the operator whose matrix is given. So let's write down P_z's matrix again:\n\nP_z is a 3x3 matrix:\nRow 1: [\u0127, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, -\u0127]\n\nSo, P_z is diagonal. That makes things easier because the expectation value is just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of each state.\n\nBut wait, the state |\u03c8\u27e9 is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. Because the question says, \"the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z.\" So each basis vector corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. That should simplify calculations, as the components of |\u03c8\u27e9 directly give the probabilities.\n\nLet me think: If the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, then each basis vector is an eigenstate of P_z. So the state |\u03c8\u27e9 can be written as a linear combination of these eigenvectors.\n\nEach component of |\u03c8\u27e9 in this basis represents the amplitude for that eigenstate. So the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of these components.\n\nSo, the components of |\u03c8\u27e9 are:\n\nFirst component: -1/2,\nSecond: 1/sqrt(2),\nThird: -1/2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute the norm to confirm it's normalized.\n\nCompute |a|^2 + |b|^2 + |c|^2.\n\n(-1/2)^2 is 1/4,\n(1/sqrt(2))^2 is 1/2,\n(-1/2)^2 is 1/4.\n\nAdding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. Okay, so it's normalized.\n\nNow, since each basis vector is an eigenstate of P_z, the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of each state.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues of P_z are:\n\nLooking at P_z's diagonal, the eigenvalues are \u0127 (for the first basis vector), 0 (second), and -\u0127 (third).\n\nSo, the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is:\n\n( |a|^2 ) * (\u0127) + ( |b|^2 ) * (0) + ( |c|^2 ) * (-\u0127 )\n\nWhich is (1/4)*\u0127 + 0 + (1/4)*(-\u0127) = (\u0127/4 - \u0127/4) = 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero.\n\nNow, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the sum of |a|^2 * (\u0127)^2 + |b|^2 * (0)^2 + |c|^2 * (-\u0127)^2.\n\nWhich is (1/4)*(\u0127\u00b2) + 0 + (1/4)*(\u0127\u00b2) = (2/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nThen, the variance is \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - (\u27e8P_z\u27e9)^2 = (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - (0)^2 = 1/2 \u0127\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = (\u0127) * sqrt(1/2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2), which matches this.\n\nBut wait a second, I think I might have made a mistake. Because P_z is an operator, its square is P_z squared. But since P_z is diagonal, the square is straightforward. So the calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9 and \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 the long way using matrices, just to double-check.\n\nThe state vector is \u03c8 = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.\n\nCompute \u27e8P_z\u27e9:\n\n\u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8.\n\nWhich is:\n\n[ (-1/2)*\u0127 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*0,\n  ... ] Wait, no, more accurately, it's the sum of the products of each component multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.\n\nWait, actually, when you compute \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8, it's the sum over i of \u03c8_i* (P_z)_ii \u03c8_i.\n\nBecause P_z is diagonal, all off-diagonal terms are zero.\n\nSo, (P_z)_11 is \u0127, (P_z)_22 is 0, (P_z)_33 is -\u0127.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = ( (-1/2) * \u0127 ) + ( (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 ) + ( (-1/2) * (-\u0127) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (-\u0127/2) + 0 + (\u0127/2) ) = 0. Yep, same as before.\n\nNow, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the same as \u03c8\u2020 P_z\u00b2 \u03c8.\n\nBut since P_z is diagonal, P_z\u00b2 is just each diagonal element squared.\n\nSo, (P_z\u00b2)_11 = (\u0127)^2, (P_z\u00b2)_22 = 0, (P_z\u00b2)_33 = (-\u0127)^2 = \u0127\u00b2.\n\nThus,\n\n\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = ( (-1/2)^2 * \u0127\u00b2 ) + ( (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 * \u0127\u00b2 )\n\n= (1/4 \u0127\u00b2 ) + 0 + (1/4 \u0127\u00b2 ) = (2/4) \u0127\u00b2 = 1/2 \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo, \u0394P_z is sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).

So option B.\n\n\nTo determine the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\nThe system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with the given state vector:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle$\nThe operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the given basis, with eigenvalues $\\hbar$, $0$, and $-\\hbar$ corresponding to the diagonal elements of its matrix:\n\n\\[\nP_z = \\begin{bmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\sum_i | \\psi_i |^2 \\cdot \\text{(eigenvalue of $P_z$ for basis state $i$)}.\n\\]\n\nThe probabilities $| \\psi_i |^2$ are:\n- $| -\\frac{1}{2} |^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$,\n- $| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$,\n- $| -\\frac{1}{2} |^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\hbar + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(0) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(-\\hbar) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$\nThe operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal:\n\n\\[\nP_z^2 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\sum_i | \\psi_i |^2 \\cdot \\text{(eigenvalue of $P_z^2$ for basis state $i$)}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are $\\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\\hbar^2$.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue.\n\nWait, first, what's the setup again? So, the operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of them is given as a matrix, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh right, because when the basis is given by the eigenvectors of an operator, it's often easier to work in that basis because the operator is diagonal there. But in this case, the state is given as an eigenstate of P_x, so maybe I need to express it in terms of the P_z basis.\n\nThe state provided is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. So, the state is |\u03c8>, and I need to compute the uncertainty in P_z, \u0394P_z.\n\nI remember that the uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square minus the square of the expectation value. So, \u0394P_z = sqrt( <P_z\u00b2> - <P_z>\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but wait a second. Since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, and the basis is P_z's eigenvectors, maybe I can compute <P_z> and <P_z\u00b2> directly.\n\nBut first, let me write down the state. The state is given as a column vector. Let me denote it as |\u03c8> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. Are these the components in the P_z basis? I think so, since the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z. So each component is the amplitude in a particular eigenstate of P_z.\n\nSo, each component corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. Let me check the matrix for P_z. The matrix is diagonal, right? Because P_z is diagonal in its own eigenbasis. So, the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. Looking at the P_z matrix:\n\nFirst row: [ \u0127, 0, 0 ]\nSecond row: [ 0, 0, 0 ]\nThird row: [ 0, 0, -\u0127 ]\n\nWait, wait. No, wait. Let me double-check. The matrix form of P_z is:\n\nFirst row: (\u0127, 0, 0)\nSecond row: (0, 0, 0)\nThird row: (0, 0, -\u0127 )\n\nWait, that can't be right because the diagonal elements would be the eigenvalues. So, the eigenvalues are \u0127, 0, -\u0127. So, the basis vectors are |+\u0127>, |0>, |-\u0127>, perhaps.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the way the matrix is written, the diagonal entries are \u0127, 0, -\u0127. So, the eigenstates are |1> (with eigenvalue \u0127), |2> (eigenvalue 0), and |3> (eigenvalue -\u0127). So, the basis vectors are |1>, |2>, |3>.\n\nSo the state |\u03c8> is expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors. The components are, in order, the amplitudes for |1>, |2>, |3>.\n\nWait, but the state given is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So, that's |\u03c8> = (-1/2)|1> + (1/sqrt(2))|2> + (-1/2)|3>.\n\nBut wait, wait, the eigenvalues for P_z are \u0127, 0, -\u0127, right? So when I compute <P_z>, it's the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.\n\nSo, <P_z> is |a|^2 * \u0127 + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-\u0127), where a, b, c are the components of |\u03c8>.\n\nBut wait, in this state, the components are a=-1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2.\n\nSo, |a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. |b|^2 = (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2. |c|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nSo, <P_z> = (1/4)*\u0127 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-\u0127) = [ (1/4 - 1/4) ] \u0127 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.\n\nNow, what about <P_z\u00b2>? Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z\u00b2 is just the square of the diagonal elements. So, each term would be |a|^2*(\u0127)^2 + |b|^2*(0)^2 + |c|^2*(-\u0127)^2.\n\nSo, <P_z\u00b2> = (1/4)(\u0127\u00b2) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(\u0127\u00b2) = (1/4 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, \u0394P_z = sqrt( <P_z\u00b2> - (<P_z>)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ) \u0127 = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because in the state, the components are given as (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Are these normalized? Let me check the sum of the squares.\n\n(|-1/2|^2) + (|1/sqrt(2)|^2) + (|-1/2|^2) = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1. Yes, it's normalized. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the uncertainty is \u0127 / sqrt(2).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the uncertainty in P_z given the state of the system. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the expectation values. The formula is \u0394P_z = sqrt( <P_z\u00b2> - <P_z>\u00b2 ). Right, so I need to compute these two expectation values.\n\nFirst, I should find the expectation value of P_z, which is <P_z>. The state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that down as |\u03c8> = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ].\n\nThe operator P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries (\u0127, 0, -\u0127). So when I calculate <P_z>, I can take the inner product of |\u03c8> with P_z |\u03c8>.\n\nWait, because P_z is diagonal, it's easier. Each component of |\u03c8> is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z, then summed up. Let me compute that.\n\nSo the first component is (-1/2) * \u0127. Second component is (1/sqrt(2)) * 0, which is zero. Third component is (-1/2) * (-\u0127) = (1/2) \u0127. Adding them together: (-1/2 \u0127) + (1/2 \u0127) = 0. So <P_z> is zero? That's interesting.\n\nNow I need to find <P_z\u00b2>. P_z squared would be P_z multiplied by itself. Since P_z is diagonal, squaring it just squares each diagonal element. So the diagonal elements of P_z\u00b2 are (\u0127\u00b2, 0, (\u2212\u0127)^2) \u2192 (\u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2).\n\nSo <P_z\u00b2> is the inner product of |\u03c8> with P_z\u00b2 |\u03c8>. Again, since P_z\u00b2 is diagonal, each component is multiplied by its squared value.\n\nFirst component: (-1/2)^2 * \u0127\u00b2 \u2192 (1/4) \u0127\u00b2. Second component: (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 \u2192 0. Third component: (-1/2)^2 * \u0127\u00b2 \u2192 (1/4) \u0127\u00b2. Adding these: (1/4 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo <P_z\u00b2> is (1/2) \u0127\u00b2. Then, <P_z> is zero, so <P_z>\u00b2 is zero. So \u0394P_z = sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) \u0127. Which simplifies to \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but let me double-check the state vector. The state is given as (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Are these normalized? Let me check the sum of the squares: (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1. So yes, the state is normalized.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the uncertainty in P_z given the state of the system. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the expectation values. The formula is \u0394P_z = sqrt( <P_z\u00b2> - <P_z>\u00b2 ). Right, so I need to compute these two expectation values.\n\nFirst, I should find the expectation value of P_z, which is <P_z>. The state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that down as |\u03c8> = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ].\n\nThe operator P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries (\u0127, 0, -\u0127). So when I calculate <P_z>, I can take the inner product of |\u03c8> with P_z |\u03c8>.\n\nWait, because P_z is diagonal, it's easier. Each component of |\u03c8> is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z, then summed up. Let me compute that.\n\nSo the first component is (-1/2) * \u0127. Second component is (1/sqrt(2)) * 0, which is zero. Third component is (-1/2) * (-\u0127) = (1/2) \u0127. Adding them together: (-1/2 \u0127) + (1/2 \u0127) = 0. So <P_z> is zero? That's interesting.\n\nNow I need to find <P_z\u00b2>. P_z squared would be P_z multiplied by itself. Since P_z is diagonal, squaring it just squares each diagonal element. So the diagonal elements of P_z\u00b2 are (\u0127\u00b2, 0, (\u2212\u0127)^2) \u2192 (\u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2).\n\nSo <P_z\u00b2> is the inner product of |\u03c8> with P_z\u00b2 |\u03c8>. Again, since P_z\u00b2 is diagonal, each component is multiplied by its squared value.\n\nFirst component: (-1/2)^2 * \u0127\u00b2 \u2192 (1/4) \u0127\u00b2.

Adding these: (1/4 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo <P_z\u00b2> is (1/2) \u0127\u00b2. Then, <P_z> is zero, so <P_z>\u00b2 is zero. So \u0394P_z = sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) \u0127. Which simplifies to \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but let me double-check the state vector.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z for a given state.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's given. We have an operator P with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is represented by a matrix. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which is important because the state we're given is expressed in this basis.\n\nThe state of the system is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And it's in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. But the question is about the uncertainty in P_z, which is \u0394P_z.\n\nI remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula \u0394A = sqrt(\u27e8A\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8A\u27e9\u00b2), where A is the operator. So here, A is P_z. So I need to compute the expectation values \u27e8P_z\u27e9 and \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9.\n\nWait, but wait. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, that should simplify things a bit. Because if the state is in an eigenstate of P_z, then the expectation value is just the eigenvalue. But wait, no, the state here is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the state is a superposition of P_z's eigenstates. That means I can't directly say what \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is; I'll have to compute it using the matrix.\n\nSo the first step is to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9. The state vector is |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T. To compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I need to calculate \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. Let me write that out.\n\nP_z is given as a 3x3 matrix:\nFirst row: [\u0127, 0, 0]\nSecond row: [0, 0, 0]\nThird row: [0, 0, -\u0127]\n\nSo the matrix P_z is diagonal. That should make things easier because when you multiply a diagonal matrix by a vector, you just scale each component.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is the sum over each component of \u03c8 times the corresponding diagonal element of P_z times the conjugate of \u03c8. Wait, actually, no. Since \u03c8 is a column vector, \u03c8\u2020 is a row vector. So \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8 is the sum of each element in \u03c8 multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z and then multiplied by the conjugate of the corresponding element in \u03c8. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as the dot product of \u03c8 with P_z acting on \u03c8.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me correct that. The expectation value \u27e8A\u27e9 is \u03c8\u2020 A \u03c8. So for each element i, j, it's the sum over i of \u03c8_i^* (A_ij) \u03c8_j.\n\nBut since P_z is diagonal, A_ij = 0 when i != j. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is the sum over i of \u03c8_i^* * (P_z)_ii * \u03c8_i.\n\nSo for each component:\n\ni=1: \u03c8_1^* * (\u0127) * \u03c8_1\ni=2: \u03c8_2^* * (0) * \u03c8_2\ni=3: \u03c8_3^* * (-\u0127) * \u03c8_3\n\nSo let's compute each term.\n\n\u03c8_1 is -1/2. Its conjugate is the same because it's real. So term1 = (-1/2) * \u0127 * (-1/2) = (1/4) \u0127.\n\n\u03c8_2 is 1/sqrt(2). Its conjugate is the same. So term2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 = 0.\n\n\u03c8_3 is -1/2. Its conjugate is the same. Term3 = (-1/2) * (-\u0127) * (-1/2) = (1/4) * (-\u0127) = -\u0127/4.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the diagonal elements are (\u0127, 0, -\u0127). So for i=3, (P_z)_ii is -\u0127.\n\nSo term3 is \u03c8_3^* * (-\u0127) * \u03c8_3.\n\n\u03c8_3 is -1/2, so \u03c8_3^* is -1/2. So term3 = (-1/2) * (-\u0127) * (-1/2) = (-1/2 * -\u0127) = (\u0127/2) multiplied by (-1/2)? Wait no, let me compute it step by step.\n\nWait, term3 = [(-1/2)] * (-\u0127) * [(-1/2)].\n\nMultiply the terms:\n\n(-1/2) * (-\u0127) = (\u0127/2). Then multiply by (-1/2) again: (\u0127/2) * (-1/2) )= -\u0127/4.\n\nSo summing all terms:\n\nterm1 + term2 + term3 = (1/4) \u0127 + 0 + (-1/4 \u0127) ) = 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 1/4 \u0127 minus 1/4 \u0127 is zero. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero.\n\nHmm. Interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.\n\nNow I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal, with each element squared.\n\nSo P_z squared has diagonal elements (\u0127^2, 0, (\u0127)^2). Wait, because (P_z)_11 is \u0127, so squared is \u0127\u00b2. (P_z)_33 is -\u0127, squared is \u0127\u00b2. So P_z\u00b2 is diag(\u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2).\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the sum over i of \u03c8_i^* (P_z\u00b2)_ii \u03c8_i.\n\nAgain, since P_z squared is diagonal, the off-diagonal terms don't contribute.\n\nSo for each component:\n\ni=1: (-1/2) * \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2) = (1/4) \u0127\u00b2.\n\ni=2: (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0.\n\ni=3: (-1/2) * \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2) = (1/4) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo sum all terms: (1/4 \u0127\u00b2) + 0 + (1/4 \u0127\u00b2) = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 ). Since \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero, this simplifies to sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 ) = sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = \u0127 * sqrt(1/2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, let me recalculate \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. For each component:\n\ni=1: \u03c8_1 is -1/2, so \u03c8_1 squared magnitude is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Multiply by \u0127\u00b2: 1/4 \u0127\u00b2.\n\ni=3: \u03c8_3 is -1/2, so same as i=1. 1/4 \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo sum is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo \u0394P_z = sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nLooking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2), which matches this.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the initial state. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Are these normalized? Let's check the norm.\n\nCompute |\u03c8|^2: sum of squares of absolute values.\n\n(-1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\n(1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\n(-1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nSum: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is B) \u0127/sqrt(2).\n",

So here, A is P_z. So I need to compute the expectation values \u27e8P_z\u27e9 and \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9.\n\nWait, but wait. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, that should simplify things a bit. Because if the state is in an eigenstate of P_z, then the expectation value is just the eigenvalue. But wait, no, the state here is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the state is a superposition of P_z's eigenstates. That means I can't directly say what \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is; I'll have to compute it using the matrix.\n\nSo the first step is to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9. The state vector is |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T. To compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I need to calculate \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. Let me write that out.\n\nP_z is given as a 3x3 matrix:\nFirst row: [\u0127, 0, 0]\nSecond row: [0, 0, 0]\nThird row: [0, 0, -\u0127]\n\nSo the matrix P_z is diagonal. That should make things easier because when you multiply a diagonal matrix by a vector, you just scale each component.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is the sum over each component of \u03c8 times the corresponding diagonal element of P_z times the conjugate of \u03c8. Wait, actually, no. Since \u03c8 is a column vector, \u03c8\u2020 is a row vector. So \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8 is the sum of each element in \u03c8 multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z and then multiplied by the conjugate of the corresponding element in \u03c8. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as the dot product of \u03c8 with P_z acting on \u03c8.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me correct that. The expectation value \u27e8A\u27e9 is \u03c8\u2020 A \u03c8. So for each element i, j, it's the sum over i of \u03c8_i^* (A_ij) \u03c8_j.\n\nBut since P_z is diagonal, A_ij = 0 when i != j. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is the sum over i of \u03c8_i^* * (P_z)_ii * \u03c8_i.\n\nSo for each component:\n\ni=1: \u03c8_1^* * (\u0127) * \u03c8_1\ni=2: \u03c8_2^* * (0) * \u03c8_2\ni=3: \u03c8_3^* * (-\u0127) * \u03c8_3\n\nSo let's compute each term.\n\n\u03c8_1 is -1/2. Its conjugate is the same because it's real. So term1 = (-1/2) * \u0127 * (-1/2) = (1/4) \u0127.\n\n\u03c8_2 is 1/sqrt(2). Its conjugate is the same. So term2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 = 0.\n\n\u03c8_3 is -1/2. Its conjugate is the same. Term3 = (-1/2) * (-\u0127) * (-1/2) = (1/4) * (-\u0127) = -\u0127/4.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the diagonal elements are (\u0127, 0, -\u0127). So for i=3, (P_z)_ii is -\u0127.\n\nSo term3 is \u03c8_3^* * (-\u0127) * \u03c8_3.\n\n\u03c8_3 is -1/2, so \u03c8_3^* is -1/2. So term3 = (-1/2) * (-\u0127) * (-1/2) = (-1/2 * -\u0127) = (\u0127/2) multiplied by (-1/2)? Wait no, let me compute it step by step.\n\nWait, term3 = [(-1/2)] * (-\u0127) * [(-1/2)].\n\nMultiply the terms:\n\n(-1/2) * (-\u0127) = (\u0127/2). Then multiply by (-1/2) again: (\u0127/2) * (-1/2) )= -\u0127/4.\n\nSo summing all terms:\n\nterm1 + term2 + term3 = (1/4) \u0127 + 0 + (-1/4 \u0127) ) = 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 1/4 \u0127 minus 1/4 \u0127 is zero. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero.\n\nHmm. Interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.\n\nNow I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal, with each element squared.\n\nSo P_z squared has diagonal elements (\u0127^2, 0, (\u0127)^2). Wait, because (P_z)_11 is \u0127, so squared is \u0127\u00b2. (P_z)_33 is -\u0127, squared is \u0127\u00b2. So P_z\u00b2 is diag(\u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2).\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the sum over i of \u03c8_i^* (P_z\u00b2)_ii \u03c8_i.\n\nAgain, since P_z squared is diagonal, the off-diagonal terms don't contribute.\n\nSo for each component:\n\ni=1: (-1/2) * \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2) = (1/4) \u0127\u00b2.\n\ni=2: (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0.\n\ni=3: (-1/2) * \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2) = (1/4) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo sum all terms: (1/4 \u0127\u00b2) + 0 + (1/4 \u0127\u00b2) = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 ). Since \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero, this simplifies to sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 ) = sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = \u0127 * sqrt(1/2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, let me recalculate \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. For each component:\n\ni=1: \u03c8_1 is -1/2, so \u03c8_1 squared magnitude is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Multiply by \u0127\u00b2: 1/4 \u0127\u00b2.\n\ni=3: \u03c8_3 is -1/2, so same as i=1. 1/4 \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo sum is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo \u0394P_z = sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nLooking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2), which matches this.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the initial state. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Are these normalized? Let's check the norm.\n\nCompute |\u03c8|^2: sum of squares of absolute values.\n\n(-1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\n(1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\n(-1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nSum: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is B) \u0127/sqrt(2).\n\n\nTo calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ for the given quantum system, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle$\nThe state of the system is given as the column vector:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe operator $P_z$ is diagonal with elements:\n\n\\[\nP_z = \\begin{bmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is computed as:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger P_z \\psi = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\psi_i^* (P_z)_{ii} \\psi_i.\n\\]\n\n- For $i=1$: $\\psi_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z)_{11} = \\hbar$, so the term is $(-\\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot \\hbar \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4}$.\n- For $i=2$: $\\psi_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $(P_z)_{22} = 0$, so the term is $0$.\n- For $i=3$: $\\psi_3 = -\\frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z)_{33} = -\\hbar$, so the term is $(-\\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot (-\\hbar) \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\frac{\\hbar}{4}$.\n\nSumming these contributions:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$\nThe operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal with elements:\n\n\\[\nP_z^2 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ is computed as:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger P_z^2 \\psi = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\psi_i^* (P_z^2)_{ii} \\psi_i.\n\\]\n\n- For $i=1$: $\\psi_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z^2)_{11} = \\hbar^2$, so the term is $(-\\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4}$.\n- For $i=2$: $\\psi_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $(P_z^2)_{22} = 0$, so the term is $0$.\n- For $i=3$: $\\psi_3 = -\\frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z^2)_{33} = \\hbar^2$, so the term is $(-\\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4}$.\n\nSumming these contributions:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute $\\Delta P_z$\nUsing the formula for uncertainty:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\nSince $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Let's see what the question is about.\n\nThe problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle involves the variance of an operator, so I think I need to calculate the expectation value of P_z squared and subtract the square of the expectation value of P_z.\n\nWait, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is the square root of the variance, which is <P_z\u00b2> - <P_z>\u00b2, right? So I need to compute these expectation values.\n\nBut first, I should look at the given matrices for the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh, so the state provided is a column vector in the P_z basis. That's good because it means I can work directly in that basis.\n\nThe state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Let me note that down. So the state vector is \u03c8 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T.\n\nNow, to find the expectation value <P_z>, I need to compute \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. Since P_z is given, let me write that matrix down.\n\nP_z matrix:\nRow 1: [\u0127, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, -\u0127]\n\nSo, it's a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues \u0127, 0, -\u0127 along the diagonal.\n\nWait, so the expectation value <P_z> is \u03c8\u2020 multiplied by P_z multiplied by \u03c8. Let me compute that.\n\nLet me compute each component:\n\nThe first element of \u03c8 is -1/2. So when we multiply P_z, the first component is \u0127*(-1/2), the second is 0*(1/\u221a2), and the third is (-\u0127)*(-1/2). Then, the dot product of \u03c8 with that vector will be the expectation value.\n\nWait, no, perhaps a better way is to compute the matrix multiplication.\n\nSo, \u03c8 is a column vector [a; b; c] where a = -1/2, b = 1/\u221a2, c = -1/2.\n\nP_z \u03c8 is:\n\nFirst component: \u0127 * a = \u0127*(-1/2)\nSecond component: 0 * b = 0\nThird component: (-\u0127) * c = (-\u0127)*(-1/2) = \u0127/2\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 (which is [a*, b*, c*], but since all elements are real, it's just [a, b, c]) multiplied by P_z \u03c8 gives:\n\na*(\u0127*(-1/2)) + b*0 + c*(\u0127/2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127/2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + (-1/2)(\u0127/2)\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute each term step by step.\n\nWait, no. Let me compute \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8.\n\nWait, \u03c8\u2020 is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]\n\nP_z is the diagonal matrix, so P_z \u03c8 is [ \u0127*(-1/2), 0, (-\u0127)*(-1/2) ]\n\nSo that's [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ]\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 multiplied by P_z \u03c8 is:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127/2) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(\u0127/2 )\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/2)(\u0127/2) = \u0127/4\nThird term: (-1/2)(\u0127/2) = - \u0127/4\n\nSo adding them together: \u0127/4 - \u0127/4 = 0.\n\nSo <P_z> is zero. Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero. \n\nNext, I need to find <P_z\u00b2>. Since P_z squared is the same as P_z multiplied by itself, but since P_z is diagonal, P_z\u00b2 will have each diagonal element squared. So the matrix for P_z\u00b2 is:\n\nRow 1: [ (\u0127)^2, 0, 0 ]\nRow 2: [ 0, 0, 0 ]\nRow 3: [ 0, 0, ( - \u0127 )^2 ] \u2192 which is [\u0127\u00b2, 0, 0 ]\n\nWait, no, wait. Because P_z is diagonal with entries \u0127, 0, -\u0127. So P_z squared would be each diagonal element squared. So P_z\u00b2 is:\n\nRow 1: (\u0127)^2 \u2192 \u0127\u00b2\nRow 2: 0^2 \u2192 0\nRow 3: (-\u0127)^2 \u2192 \u0127\u00b2\n\nSo the matrix is diagonal with [\u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2].\n\nSo now, <P_z\u00b2> is \u03c8\u2020 P_z\u00b2 \u03c8.\n\nSo compute that. Let's see.\n\nP_z\u00b2 \u03c8 is:\n\nFirst component: \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2)\nSecond component: 0\nThird component: \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2 )\n\nSo the vector is [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ]\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 (which is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]) multiplied by this gives:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127\u00b2/2) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(-\u0127\u00b2/2 )\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/2)(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/4\nThird term: (1/2)(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/4\n\nSo sum is \u0127\u00b2/4 + \u0127\u00b2/4 = \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nSo <P_z\u00b2> is \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt( <P_z\u00b2> - <P_z>^2 ). We've found <P_z> is zero, so this becomes sqrt( \u0127\u00b2/2 - 0 ) = sqrt( \u0127\u00b2/2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nOption B is \u0127/\u221a2. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nCompute <P_z> again:\n\n\u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8: each term is a_i * (P_z)_ii * a_i, because P_z is diagonal.\n\nSo:\n\na^2 * \u0127 + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * (-\u0127)\n\nWait, wait, no. Because when you have a diagonal matrix, the expectation value is the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the squares of the corresponding components.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute it that way.\n\nSo:\n\na = -1/2 \u2192 a\u00b2 = 1/4\nb = 1/\u221a2 \u2192 b\u00b2 = 1/2\nc = -1/2 \u2192 c\u00b2 = 1/4\n\nSo <P_z> = a\u00b2 * \u0127 + b\u00b2 * 0 + c\u00b2 * (-\u0127)\n\nSo that's (1/4)\u0127 + 0 + (1/4)(-\u0127) = (1/4 - 1/4) \u0127 = 0. That's correct.\n\nThen, <P_z\u00b2> is a\u00b2*(\u0127\u00b2) + b\u00b2*(0) + c\u00b2*(\u0127\u00b2) = (1/4) \u0127\u00b2 + (1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo variance is 1/2 \u0127\u00b2, sqrt is \u0127 / sqrt(2), which is option B.\n",

So the state vector is \u03c8 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T.\n\nNow, to find the expectation value <P_z>, I need to compute \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. Since P_z is given, let me write that matrix down.\n\nP_z matrix:\nRow 1: [\u0127, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, -\u0127]\n\nSo, it's a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues \u0127, 0, -\u0127 along the diagonal.\n\nWait, so the expectation value <P_z> is \u03c8\u2020 multiplied by P_z multiplied by \u03c8. Let me compute that.\n\nLet me compute each component:\n\nThe first element of \u03c8 is -1/2. So when we multiply P_z, the first component is \u0127*(-1/2), the second is 0*(1/\u221a2), and the third is (-\u0127)*(-1/2). Then, the dot product of \u03c8 with that vector will be the expectation value.\n\nWait, no, perhaps a better way is to compute the matrix multiplication.\n\nSo, \u03c8 is a column vector [a; b; c] where a = -1/2, b = 1/\u221a2, c = -1/2.\n\nP_z \u03c8 is:\n\nFirst component: \u0127 * a = \u0127*(-1/2)\nSecond component: 0 * b = 0\nThird component: (-\u0127) * c = (-\u0127)*(-1/2) = \u0127/2\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 (which is [a*, b*, c*], but since all elements are real, it's just [a, b, c]) multiplied by P_z \u03c8 gives:\n\na*(\u0127*(-1/2)) + b*0 + c*(\u0127/2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127/2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + (-1/2)(\u0127/2)\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute each term step by step.\n\nWait, no. Let me compute \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8.\n\nWait, \u03c8\u2020 is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]\n\nP_z is the diagonal matrix, so P_z \u03c8 is [ \u0127*(-1/2), 0, (-\u0127)*(-1/2) ]\n\nSo that's [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ]\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 multiplied by P_z \u03c8 is:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127/2) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(\u0127/2 )\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/2)(\u0127/2) = \u0127/4\nThird term: (-1/2)(\u0127/2) = - \u0127/4\n\nSo adding them together: \u0127/4 - \u0127/4 = 0.\n\nSo <P_z> is zero. Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero. \n\nNext, I need to find <P_z\u00b2>. Since P_z squared is the same as P_z multiplied by itself, but since P_z is diagonal, P_z\u00b2 will have each diagonal element squared. So the matrix for P_z\u00b2 is:\n\nRow 1: [ (\u0127)^2, 0, 0 ]\nRow 2: [ 0, 0, 0 ]\nRow 3: [ 0, 0, ( - \u0127 )^2 ] \u2192 which is [\u0127\u00b2, 0, 0 ]\n\nWait, no, wait. Because P_z is diagonal with entries \u0127, 0, -\u0127. So P_z squared would be each diagonal element squared. So P_z\u00b2 is:\n\nRow 1: (\u0127)^2 \u2192 \u0127\u00b2\nRow 2: 0^2 \u2192 0\nRow 3: (-\u0127)^2 \u2192 \u0127\u00b2\n\nSo the matrix is diagonal with [\u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2].\n\nSo now, <P_z\u00b2> is \u03c8\u2020 P_z\u00b2 \u03c8.\n\nSo compute that. Let's see.\n\nP_z\u00b2 \u03c8 is:\n\nFirst component: \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2)\nSecond component: 0\nThird component: \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2 )\n\nSo the vector is [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ]\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 (which is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]) multiplied by this gives:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127\u00b2/2) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(-\u0127\u00b2/2 )\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/2)(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/4\nThird term: (1/2)(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/4\n\nSo sum is \u0127\u00b2/4 + \u0127\u00b2/4 = \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nSo <P_z\u00b2> is \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt( <P_z\u00b2> - <P_z>^2 ). We've found <P_z> is zero, so this becomes sqrt( \u0127\u00b2/2 - 0 ) = sqrt( \u0127\u00b2/2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nOption B is \u0127/\u221a2. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nCompute <P_z> again:\n\n\u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8: each term is a_i * (P_z)_ii * a_i, because P_z is diagonal.\n\nSo:\n\na^2 * \u0127 + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * (-\u0127)\n\nWait, wait, no. Because when you have a diagonal matrix, the expectation value is the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the squares of the corresponding components.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute it that way.\n\nSo:\n\na = -1/2 \u2192 a\u00b2 = 1/4\nb = 1/\u221a2 \u2192 b\u00b2 = 1/2\nc = -1/2 \u2192 c\u00b2 = 1/4\n\nSo <P_z> = a\u00b2 * \u0127 + b\u00b2 * 0 + c\u00b2 * (-\u0127)\n\nSo that's (1/4)\u0127 + 0 + (1/4)(-\u0127) = (1/4 - 1/4) \u0127 = 0. That's correct.\n\nThen, <P_z\u00b2> is a\u00b2*(\u0127\u00b2) + b\u00b2*(0) + c\u00b2*(\u0127\u00b2) = (1/4) \u0127\u00b2 + (1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo variance is 1/2 \u0127\u00b2, sqrt is \u0127 / sqrt(2), which is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle$\nThe state vector is given as $\\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{bmatrix}$, and the matrix for $P_z$ is:\n\n\\[\nP_z = \\begin{bmatrix} \n\\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & -\\hbar \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nSince $P_z$ is diagonal, the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is computed as:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger P_z \\psi = (-1/2)^2 \\hbar + (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot 0 + (-1/2)^2 \\cdot (-\\hbar).\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n- $(-1/2)^2 \\hbar = (1/4)\\hbar$,\n- $(1/\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot 0 = 0$,\n- $(-1/2)^2 \\cdot (-\\hbar) = -(1/4)\\hbar$.\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = (1/4)\\hbar - (1/4)\\hbar = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$\nThe matrix for $P_z^2$ is:\n\n\\[\nP_z^2 = \\begin{bmatrix} \n\\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ is computed as:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger P_z^2 \\psi = (-1/2)^2 \\hbar^2 + (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot 0 + (-1/2)^2 \\hbar^2.\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n- $(-1/2)^2 \\hbar^2 = (1/4)\\hbar^2$,\n- $(1/\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot 0 = 0$,\n- $(-1/2)^2 \\hbar^2 = (1/4)\\hbar^2$.\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (1/4)\\hbar^2 + (1/4)\\hbar^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute $\\Delta P_z$\nThe uncertainty is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem is about finding the uncertainty \u0394P_z for a given state. The operator P_x is given, and the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. The state is provided as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, I need to compute the uncertainty in P_z.\n\nHmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula \u0394A = sqrt(\u27e8A\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8A\u27e9\u00b2). So here, A is P_z. So I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9 and \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9, then take the square root of their difference.\n\nBut wait, the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_x, not P_z. Oh right, because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means the given state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. Wait no, wait. The problem says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state vector is written in terms of these basis vectors. So, the state is already in the P_z basis. That should make things easier because I can directly compute expectation values without changing the basis.\n\nWait, but the state is an eigenstate of P_x, which is an operator in a different basis. So maybe I don't need to worry about that for this particular calculation. Since the state is given in the P_z eigenbasis, I can compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9 and \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 directly.\n\nWait, no, because the state is given as a vector in the P_z basis. So each component corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. So the components are in the order of the eigenstates of P_z.\n\nSo, first, let's write down the given state. The state vector is:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T\n\nSince the basis is the P_z eigenbasis, each component corresponds to the eigenvalue of P_z. Let's find what those eigenvalues are.\n\nLooking at the matrix for P_z, which is given as:\nRow 1: [\u0127, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, -\u0127]\n\nWait, but that's the matrix representation in the basis of its own eigenvectors. Because when an operator is diagonal in its own eigenbasis, the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. So P_z has eigenvalues \u0127, 0, -\u0127, corresponding to the basis vectors |1\u27e9, |2\u27e9, |3\u27e9, I suppose.\n\nWait, but wait. The columns of the matrix correspond to the basis vectors. So the standard basis vectors are the eigenvectors. So the first basis vector (let's say |1\u27e9) has eigenvalue \u0127, the second (|2\u27e9) eigenvalue 0, and the third (|3\u27e9) eigenvalue -\u0127.\n\nSo the state |\u03c8\u27e9 is expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors. The components are:\n\n- The coefficient of |1\u27e9 is -1/2.\n\n- The coefficient of |2\u27e9 is 1/\u221a2.\n\n- The coefficient of |3\u27e9 is -1/2.\n\nSo, to find \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I can compute the expectation value as the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is just the weighted average.\n\nSo, each component squared gives the probability. Let's compute them.\n\nThe probabilities are |a1|^2, |a2|^2, |a3|^2.\n\nCompute each:\n\n|a1|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\n|a2|^2 = (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2.\n\n|a3|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nSo the probabilities are 1/4, 1/2, 1/4.\n\nNow, the eigenvalues for each are \u0127, 0, -\u0127.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (1/4)*\u0127 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-\u0127) \n\nCalculating that:\n\n= (1/4 \u0127) + 0 + (-1/4 \u0127) = 0.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero.\n\nNow, what about \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9?\n\nWell, P_z squared would have eigenvalues that are the squares of the original eigenvalues. Because when you square the operator, each eigenvalue is squared.\n\nSo, eigenvalues of P_z are \u0127, 0, -\u0127. Squaring them gives \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/4)*\u0127\u00b2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*\u0127\u00b2.\n\nThat's (1/4 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo now, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt( \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 )\n\nWe have \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = 0, so \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 is 0.\n\nThus, \u0394P_z = sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - 0 ) = sqrt( \u0127\u00b2 / 2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2). So that's the answer?\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I make a mistake anywhere?\n\nHmm. Let me verify the state vector. The components are (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). So when I square them, the sum is (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1, which is good, so it's normalized.\n\nCalculating \u27e8P_z\u27e9 as 0 makes sense because the positive and negative contributions cancel out.\n\nAnd \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/4 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2), which is option B.\n",

Squaring them gives \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/4)*\u0127\u00b2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*\u0127\u00b2.\n\nThat's (1/4 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo now, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt( \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 )\n\nWe have \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = 0, so \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 is 0.\n\nThus, \u0394P_z = sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - 0 ) = sqrt( \u0127\u00b2 / 2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2). So that's the answer?\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I make a mistake anywhere?\n\nHmm. Let me verify the state vector. The components are (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). So when I square them, the sum is (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1, which is good, so it's normalized.\n\nCalculating \u27e8P_z\u27e9 as 0 makes sense because the positive and negative contributions cancel out.\n\nAnd \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/4 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2), which is option B.\n\n\nTo calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ for the given state, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle$\nThe state is given as a column vector:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\\hbar$, $0$, and $-\\hbar$. The coefficients of the state correspond to the probabilities of the system being in these eigenstates. The probabilities are:\n\n\\[\n|a_1|^2 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}, \\quad |a_2|^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad |a_3|^2 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}.\n\\]\n\nThe expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is the weighted sum of the eigenvalues:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(\\hbar) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(0) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(-\\hbar) = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$\nThe eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, which are $\\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(\\hbar^2) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(0) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(\\hbar^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\hbar^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute $\\Delta P_z$\nUsing the formula for uncertainty:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\nSince $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\hbar^2} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula \u0394P = sqrt(\u27e8P\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P\u27e9\u00b2). So for \u0394P_z, I'll need to compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 and \u27e8P_z\u27e9, then take the square root of their difference.\n\nWait, but wait, the state given is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. Oh, but the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is expressed in the P_z basis. That might complicate things because the state isn't an eigenstate of P_z, right? So when I calculate \u27e8P_z\u27e9, it might not just be the eigenvalue; I might have to compute it as the expectation value.\n\nThe state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Let me note that down. So, the state vector \u03c8 is [ -1/2; 1/\u221a2; -1/2 ].\n\nFirst, I think I should compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each basis vector corresponds to an eigenvalue. Let me recall the matrix form of P_z. It's given as:\n\nP_z matrix:\n[ \u0127   0      0   ]\n[ 0   0      0   ]\n[ 0   0   -\u0127 ]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says P_z has first row (\u0127, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-\u0127). So the diagonal entries are \u0127, 0, -\u0127. So the eigenvalues for P_z are \u0127, 0, and -\u0127, corresponding to the three basis vectors |1\u27e9, |2\u27e9, |3\u27e9.\n\nBut wait, the state is a vector in this basis. So |\u03c8\u27e9 = (-1/2)|1\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2)|2\u27e9 + (-1/2)|3\u27e9.\n\nTo compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I can take the expectation value of P_z in this state. Since the basis is the eigenbasis, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.\n\nSo let me compute that. The components of \u03c8 are the coefficients in each basis. So the probability for each eigenstate is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient.\n\nSo |a1|\u00b2 = (1/2)\u00b2 = 1/4. Similarly, |a2|\u00b2 = (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2. |a3|\u00b2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nWait, but wait, the state vector is (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). So each component is the amplitude for the respective eigenstate. So |a1|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, but wait, the first component is -1/2, so its square is (1/2)^2=1/4. Similarly, the third component is -1/2, so square is 1/4. The middle is (1/\u221a2)^2=1/2.\n\nSo the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 would be:\n\n(1/4)*\u0127 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-\u0127) = (1/4 - 1/4) \u0127 + 0 = 0. Oh, because the middle term is zero. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero.\n\nNow I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z squared is just the square of the eigenvalues on the diagonal.\n\nSo the eigenvalues squared are (\u0127)^2, 0^2=0, and (-\u0127)^2=\u0127\u00b2. So for each component:\n\n|a1|\u00b2 * (\u0127)^2 + |a2|\u00b2 * (0)^2 + |a3|\u00b2 * (\u0127)^2.\n\nWhich is (1/4)*\u0127\u00b2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*\u0127\u00b2 = (1/4 + 1/4)\u0127\u00b2 = (1/2)\u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/2)\u0127\u00b2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty is sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2) = sqrt( (1/2)\u0127\u00b2 - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2)\u0127\u00b2 ) = (\u0127) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2). So the uncertainty is \u0127/sqrt(2), so the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The state is in the P_z basis, so the expectation of P_z is correct as the weighted sum. The P_z squared expectation is correctly calculated.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2)\u0127\u00b2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). So the answer is option B.\n",
