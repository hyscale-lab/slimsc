      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The question gives me two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. \n\nFirst, I think equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I recall is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Oh wait, right, because the planet reflects some light (albedo) and absorbs the rest. Since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out in the ratio.\n\nWait, but wait, the formula. Let me get this right. The equilibrium temperature is given by T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. Since the albedos are the same, the (1-A) term will be the same for both planets, so when I take the ratio, that term will cancel. So the ratio of T_p1 to T_p2 will depend on the sqrt(R_s/(2a1)) divided by sqrt(R_s/(2a2)).\n\nSimplifying that, the R_s and 2 in denominator cancel, so it becomes sqrt(a2/a1). So the ratio T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt(a2 / a1). Because a is the orbital distance.\n\nBut how do I find a1 and a2? Well, the question mentions that the RV method detected the planets. The RV method gives the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But wait, in this case, they give the shifts in forbidden lines, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull.\n\nThe radial velocity shift (Doppler shift) is related to the mass of the planet and the size of the orbit. The formula for RV semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 - e^2))^(1/2) ) * (1 / (P * (1 day in seconds)) )^(1/3) ), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), that term goes away. Also, the planet masses are much smaller than the star, so M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. \n\nWait, but maybe I can relate the RV shifts to the planet masses and orbital periods. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ), but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe I can find the orbital periods using the RV data.\n\nWait, another approach: the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K. The formula for K is given by:\n\nK = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * ( ( 1 ) / (P * 2\u03c0 )^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. Also, since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star, so the denominator is M_star^(1/3). So K \u2248 ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) / (2\u03c0)^(1/3) )\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = [ ( (27 * pi * G ) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) ] * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to realize that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ). Since both planets are around the same star, M_star is the same for both. So the ratio of K1 to K2 would be (M1 / M2) * ( (P2/P1) )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) / M_star^(2/3) ), which cancels, so K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWait, but I don't know the periods. Hmm, but wait, the transit method gives the period as the time between transits. But the question doesn't give the periods. Oh wait, but maybe the RV shifts can help me find the period. Because the RV method gives the period as the same as the transit period. But the question doesn't provide the periods, so perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, the question gives the RV-induced Doppler shifts for each planet. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. Planet2 causes a shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Wait, the [OI] line is at 6300 \u00c5, so the star's own spectrum has that line. The Doppler shift is measured as the shift in wavelength. So the shift is delta lambda, which relates to velocity via delta lambda / lambda = v/c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us.\n\nSo for each planet, the RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. So K1 = delta_lambda1 * c / lambda. Similarly, K2 = delta_lambda2 * c / lambda.\n\nWait, so K is proportional to delta_lambda. Because K = (v) = (delta_lambda * c ) / lambda.\n\nSo K1 = (0.03 \u00c5 / 6300 \u00c5) * c. Similarly K2 = (0.04 \u00c5 / 6300 \u00c5) * c.\n\nSo the ratio K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.\n\nBut earlier, we had K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3).\n\nBut I don't know P1 and P2. Hmm, but perhaps I can find the ratio of the orbital periods using the RV data.\n\nWait, from the RV method, the period P is the same as the transit period. But since the question doesn't give the periods, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift (K) relates to the mass and the period.\n\nWait, maybe I can express the period in terms of the planet's orbital distance. The period P is given by Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G(M_star)) a^3. So a^3 = (G M_star P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2).\n\nBut how does that help me here? Maybe I can find the ratio of a1 to a2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can relate the semi-amplitude K to the planet's mass and the orbital period. Let me recall the formula.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1/( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )) ) * (1/( (2\u03c0) * (1/(P)) ) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, that's a bit complicated. Let me simplify. Since e=0 and M_p << M_star, the formula simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/( (2\u03c0 P )^(1/3) ) )\n\nSo K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1/( (2\u03c0 P )^(1/3) )) )\n\nLet me cube both sides to make it easier:\n\nK^3 = (G^3 M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 * (2\u03c0 P ) )\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\nP = (G^3 M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 * 2\u03c0 * K^3 )\n\nSo the period is proportional to (M_p^3) / ( K^3 )\n\nSince M_star is the same for both planets, the ratio of periods P1/P2 would be ( (M1^3 / K1^3 ) ) / ( (M2^3 / K2^3 ) ) )\n\nWhich simplifies to (M1^3 * K2^3) / ( M2^3 * K1^3 )\n\nSo P1/P2 = ( (M1/M2) )^3 * ( K2/K1 )^3 )\n\nBut earlier, I found that K1/K2 = 3/4, so K2/K1 = 4/3.\n\nSo P1/P2 = ( (7/5)^3 ) * ( (4/3)^3 )\n\nCalculating that: (343/125) * (64/27) ) = (343 * 64) / (125 *27 )\n\nWait, 343 is 7^3, 64 is 4^3, 125 is 5^3, 27 is 3^3.\n\nLet me compute that: 343 *64 = let's see, 343 * 60 = 20580, 343 *4=1372. Sum is 20580+1372=21952. Denominator: 125 *27=3375.\n\nSo 21952 / 3375 \u2248 let's compute that. 3375 * 6 = 20250. 21952-20250=1702. So 6 + 1702/3375 \u2248 6.505.\n\nSo P1/P2 \u22486.505. So P1 is about 6.5 times longer than P2.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, (M1/M2) is 7/5, which is 1.4. K2/K1 is 4/3, which is about 1.333. So (1.4)^3 is 2.744, and (1.333)^3 is about 2.37. Multiplying them gives 2.744 *2.37\u22486.505. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo P1 =6.505 * P2. So the period of Planet1 is longer than Planet2.\n\nBut how does this relate to the orbital distance a? From Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G M_star P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0^2 )\n\nSo a is proportional to ( P^(2/3) ) * M_star^(-1/3 )\n\nSince M_star is the same for both, a is proportional to P^(2/3).\n\nSo a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3) ) = (6.505)^(2/3)\n\nWhat's 6.505^(1/3)? Let me think. 1.8^3 is 5.832, 1.85^3 is approx 6.329, 1.87^3\u2248 6.585. So cube root of 6.505 is about 1.865. So (6.505)^(2/3) = (1.865)^2 \u22483.48.\n\nSo a1/a2 \u22483.48. So a1 is about 3.48 times a2.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, which is sqrt(a2/a1). Because T_p1/T_p2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, because T_p is proportional to sqrt(Rstar/(2a)).\n\nWait, earlier I thought the ratio T_p1/T_p2 is sqrt(a2/a1). Let me confirm.\n\nT_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A )^0.25 )\n\nSince R_s and (1 - A) are the same for both, the ratio is sqrt( (R_s/(2a1)) / (R_s/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo if a1 is 3.48 a2, then a2/a1 is 1/3.48 \u22480.287.\n\nSo sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536. So T_p1 is about 0.536 times T_p2.\n\nSo the ratio T_p1 / T_p2 \u22480.536, which is approximately 0.53. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up a1 and a2.\n\nWait, a1 is the distance of Planet1, a2 of Planet2. So a1 =3.48 a2. So a2/a1 is 1/3.48 \u22480.287. So sqrt(0.287)\u22480.536. So T_p1 is 0.536 * T_p2. So the ratio is about 0.53, so the answer would be C.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation steps. Let me go through it again.\n\n1. K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )\n\n2. So K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\n3. So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3 * (M2/M1)^3\n\nWait, let me re-express that step.\n\nWait, from K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo (P2/P1)^(1/3) = (K1/K2) * (M2/M1)\n\nSo (P2/P1) = [ (K1/K2) * (M2/M1) ]^3\n\nSo (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3 * (M2/M1)^3\n\nWhich is the same as (M2^3 K1^3) / (M1^3 K2^3 )\n\nWait, no, let me recompute:\n\nWait, K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo rearranging,\n\n(P2/P1)^(1/3) = (K1/K2) * (M2/M1)\n\nSo (P2/P1) = [ (K1/K2) * (M2/M1) ]^3\n\n= (K1/K2)^3 * (M2/M1)^3\n\nWhich is (M2^3 K1^3) / (M1^3 K2^3 )\n\nSo, P2/P1 = ( (M2^3 K1^3) ) / ( M1^3 K2^3 )\n\nSo for our case,\n\nM1=7, M2=5,\n\nK1=0.03, K2=0.04.\n\nSo,\n\nP2/P1 = (5^3 * (0.03)^3 ) / (7^3 * (0.04)^3 )\n\nCompute numerator and denominator:\n\n5^3=125, 7^3=343,\n\n0.03^3=0.000027,\n\n0.04^3=0.000064.\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator: 125 * 0.000027 = 0.003375\n\nDenominator: 343 * 0.000064 \u2248 0.021952\n\nSo P2/P1 = 0.003375 / 0.021952 \u22480.1536\n\nSo P2 is about 0.1536 times P1. So P1 is about 6.51 times P2.\n\nWhich matches what I found earlier. So a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3) = (6.51)^(2/3). Wait, earlier I said (6.505)^(2/3)\u22483.48. Let me compute 6.51^(2/3).\n\nCube root of 6.51 is approximately 1.868. Square that: 1.868^2 \u22483.49. So a1/a2\u22483.49.\n\nSo T_p1 = T_p2 * sqrt(a2/a1) = T_p2 * sqrt(1/3.49) = T_p2 * sqrt(0.2867) \u2248 T_p2 * 0.535. So the ratio T_p1/T_p2 is approximately 0.535, which is option C.\n",

Since e=0 and M_p << M_star, the formula simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/( (2\u03c0 P )^(1/3) ) )\n\nSo K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1/( (2\u03c0 P )^(1/3) )) )\n\nLet me cube both sides to make it easier:\n\nK^3 = (G^3 M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 * (2\u03c0 P ) )\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\nP = (G^3 M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 * 2\u03c0 * K^3 )\n\nSo the period is proportional to (M_p^3) / ( K^3 )\n\nSince M_star is the same for both planets, the ratio of periods P1/P2 would be ( (M1^3 / K1^3 ) ) / ( (M2^3 / K2^3 ) ) )\n\nWhich simplifies to (M1^3 * K2^3) / ( M2^3 * K1^3 )\n\nSo P1/P2 = ( (M1/M2) )^3 * ( K2/K1 )^3 )\n\nBut earlier, I found that K1/K2 = 3/4, so K2/K1 = 4/3.\n\nSo P1/P2 = ( (7/5)^3 ) * ( (4/3)^3 )\n\nCalculating that: (343/125) * (64/27) ) = (343 * 64) / (125 *27 )\n\nWait, 343 is 7^3, 64 is 4^3, 125 is 5^3, 27 is 3^3.\n\nLet me compute that: 343 *64 = let's see, 343 * 60 = 20580, 343 *4=1372. Sum is 20580+1372=21952. Denominator: 125 *27=3375.\n\nSo 21952 / 3375 \u2248 let's compute that. 3375 * 6 = 20250. 21952-20250=1702. So 6 + 1702/3375 \u2248 6.505.\n\nSo P1/P2 \u22486.505. So P1 is about 6.5 times longer than P2.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, (M1/M2) is 7/5, which is 1.4. K2/K1 is 4/3, which is about 1.333. So (1.4)^3 is 2.744, and (1.333)^3 is about 2.37. Multiplying them gives 2.744 *2.37\u22486.505. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo P1 =6.505 * P2. So the period of Planet1 is longer than Planet2.\n\nBut how does this relate to the orbital distance a? From Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G M_star P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0^2 )\n\nSo a is proportional to ( P^(2/3) ) * M_star^(-1/3 )\n\nSince M_star is the same for both, a is proportional to P^(2/3).\n\nSo a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3) ) = (6.505)^(2/3)\n\nWhat's 6.505^(1/3)? Let me think. 1.8^3 is 5.832, 1.85^3 is approx 6.329, 1.87^3\u2248 6.585. So cube root of 6.505 is about 1.865. So (6.505)^(2/3) = (1.865)^2 \u22483.48.\n\nSo a1/a2 \u22483.48. So a1 is about 3.48 times a2.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, which is sqrt(a2/a1). Because T_p1/T_p2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, because T_p is proportional to sqrt(Rstar/(2a)).\n\nWait, earlier I thought the ratio T_p1/T_p2 is sqrt(a2/a1). Let me confirm.\n\nT_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A )^0.25 )\n\nSince R_s and (1 - A) are the same for both, the ratio is sqrt( (R_s/(2a1)) / (R_s/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo if a1 is 3.48 a2, then a2/a1 is 1/3.48 \u22480.287.\n\nSo sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536. So T_p1 is about 0.536 times T_p2.\n\nSo the ratio T_p1 / T_p2 \u22480.536, which is approximately 0.53. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up a1 and a2.\n\nWait, a1 is the distance of Planet1, a2 of Planet2. So a1 =3.48 a2. So a2/a1 is 1/3.48 \u22480.287. So sqrt(0.287)\u22480.536. So T_p1 is 0.536 * T_p2. So the ratio is about 0.53, so the answer would be C.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation steps. Let me go through it again.\n\n1. K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )\n\n2. So K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\n3. So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3 * (M2/M1)^3\n\nWait, let me re-express that step.\n\nWait, from K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo (P2/P1)^(1/3) = (K1/K2) * (M2/M1)\n\nSo (P2/P1) = [ (K1/K2) * (M2/M1) ]^3\n\nSo (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3 * (M2/M1)^3\n\nWhich is the same as (M2^3 K1^3) / (M1^3 K2^3 )\n\nWait, no, let me recompute:\n\nWait, K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo rearranging,\n\n(P2/P1)^(1/3) = (K1/K2) * (M2/M1)\n\nSo (P2/P1) = [ (K1/K2) * (M2/M1) ]^3\n\n= (K1/K2)^3 * (M2/M1)^3\n\nWhich is (M2^3 K1^3) / (M1^3 K2^3 )\n\nSo, P2/P1 = ( (M2^3 K1^3) ) / ( M1^3 K2^3 )\n\nSo for our case,\n\nM1=7, M2=5,\n\nK1=0.03, K2=0.04.\n\nSo,\n\nP2/P1 = (5^3 * (0.03)^3 ) / (7^3 * (0.04)^3 )\n\nCompute numerator and denominator:\n\n5^3=125, 7^3=343,\n\n0.03^3=0.000027,\n\n0.04^3=0.000064.\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator: 125 * 0.000027 = 0.003375\n\nDenominator: 343 * 0.000064 \u2248 0.021952\n\nSo P2/P1 = 0.003375 / 0.021952 \u22480.1536\n\nSo P2 is about 0.1536 times P1. So P1 is about 6.51 times P2.\n\nWhich matches what I found earlier. So a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3) = (6.51)^(2/3). Wait, earlier I said (6.505)^(2/3)\u22483.48. Let me compute 6.51^(2/3).\n\nCube root of 6.51 is approximately 1.868. Square that: 1.868^2 \u22483.49. So a1/a2\u22483.49.\n\nSo T_p1 = T_p2 * sqrt(a2/a1) = T_p2 * sqrt(1/3.49) = T_p2 * sqrt(0.2867) \u2248 T_p2 * 0.535. So the ratio T_p1/T_p2 is approximately 0.535, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:\n\n\\[\nT_p = T_s \\sqrt{\\frac{R_s}{2a}} \\left(1 - A\\right)^{0.25}\n\\]\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo (\\(A\\)), the \\((1 - A)^{0.25}\\) term cancels out in the ratio. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{p1}}{T_{p2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) are the orbital distances of Planet1 and Planet2, respectively. To find \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\), we use Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[\nP^2 \\propto a^3\n\\]\n\nThe orbital period \\(P\\) is related to the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \\(K\\) and the planet's mass \\(M_p\\) via:\n\n\\[\nK \\propto \\frac{M_p}{P^{1/3}}\n\\]\n\nRearranging, the period \\(P\\) is proportional to:\n\n\\[\nP \\propto \\frac{M_p^3}{K^3}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(M_1 = 7\\), \\(M_2 = 5\\), \\(K_1 = 0.03 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\), and \\(K_2 = 0.04 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\), the ratio of periods is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{M_1^3}{M_2^3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_2^3}{K_1^3}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{7^3}{5^3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{0.04^3}{0.03^3}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{343}{125}\\right) \\left(\\frac{64}{27}\\right) \\approx 6.505\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(P_1 \\approx 6.505 \\, P_2\\). Using Kepler's law, the orbital distances are related as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{2/3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = (6.505)^{2/3} \\approx 3.48\n\\]\n\nFinally, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{p1}}{T_{p2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3.48}} \\approx 0.536\n\\]\n\nThis corresponds to approximately 0.53, which matches option C.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe question says there are two planets orbiting a star. Both have been detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. The star's properties are given: mass is 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times Sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. \n\nPlanet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect, impacting their equilibrium temperature.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, Planet1 to Planet2. The options are A to D.\n\nI remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )^(1/2) or wait, maybe the formula is T_eq = T_star * ( ( R_star/(2a) )^(1/2) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Wait, I'm a bit confused, let me think again.\n\nOh right, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ), where A is the albedo. But wait, I think sometimes the formula is written as T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R/(2d)), where R is the star's radius and d is the planet's orbital distance (a). \n\nBut wait, the question doesn't give the orbital distances. Hmm. But perhaps we can find the orbital distances using the radial velocity method data given.\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift relates to the mass of the planet and the distance of the planet from the star. \n\nThe data given is that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. Planet2 causes a shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. \n\nI think the RV method gives a semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula for K is K = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is 0, so that term drops. \n\nBut I'm not sure how to directly relate the RV shift to the semi-major axis. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period, but without knowing the period, maybe I can find the period using the transit method? Wait, but the question doesn't give any transit timing or period. Hmm.\n\nWait, the transit method gives the planet's orbital period because the transit occurs periodically. But since the question doesn't provide the period, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the RV shift can be used to find the mass function, which can relate to the planet's mass and the semi-major axis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets because the RV shift depends on (M_planet / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/(a)^(1/3)) ) or something like that. Because higher mass planet or closer planet (smaller a) would cause a larger RV shift.\n\nWait, let me think about the RV semi-amplitude K. The formula is K = [ (2\u03c0 G) / (P) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ] * (1/(1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2)) )\n\nSince e is 0, and M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, so the formula simplifies to K \u2248 (2\u03c0 G / P)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / M_*^(2/3) )\n\nBut without knowing P, this might not help directly. Alternatively, Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_*)/(4\u03c0\u00b2). So P^2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a^3)/(G M_*). \n\nSubstituting P into the K equation:\n\nK = [ (2\u03c0 G) / ( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a^3/(G M_* )) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)/M_*^(2/3) )\n\nSimplify inside the cube root:\n\n(2\u03c0 G) * (G M_* )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) ) ) = (2 \u03c0 G^2 M_* ) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) ) = (G^2 M_*) ) / (2 \u03c0 a^3 )\n\nWait, but perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, let's think about the ratio of K for the two planets.\n\nK1 = 0.03 \u00c5, K2 = 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nAssuming that both planets are orbiting the same star (same M_*, same inclination i if sin i is the same; but since both are detected via transit, their inclinations are likely the same, i=90 degrees, so sin i=1.)\n\nSo, K1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/3) ) / (M2 a1^(1/3) )\n\nBecause from the K formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (a^(1/3)) ), considering the other terms are same for both planets.\n\nWait, let me re-express the K formula in terms of a.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G M_* P^2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2). But we can also express P in terms of the orbital period, which is related to the velocity. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation between K and a.\n\nFrom K = (v), which is velocity amplitude. The star's velocity is v = 2\u03c0 a_* sin i / P, where a_* is the star's orbit around the barycenter. But I think a_* = (M_p/(M_* + M_p)) a. Since M_p is much less than M_*, a_* \u2248 (M_p/M_*) a.\n\nSo v \u2248 (2\u03c0 (M_p a) )/( M_* P ) ) \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3)/(G M_* )\n\nSo substituting P into v:\n\nv = (2 \u03c0 M_p a )/( M_* ) * [ (G M_* )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) )^(1/2) ) ]\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\nP^2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3)/(G M_* )\n\nTake square root:\n\nP = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3/(G M_* ))^(1/2 )\n\nSo 1/P = (G M_* )^(1/2) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )^(1/2 )\n\nSo 1/P = (G M_* )^(1/2) ) / ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) )\n\n= sqrt(G M_*) / ( 2 \u03c0 a^(3/2) )\n\nNow, back to v:\n\nv = (2 \u03c0 M_p a )/( M_* ) * [ (G M_* )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) )^(1/2) ) ]\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Alternatively, using K = ( (G M_p sin i )/( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(sqrt(1-e\u00b2))) )\n\nBut since e=0 and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to K = (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) * (2 pi a)^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the ratio K1/K2.\n\nK1/K2 = ( (M1 / a1^(1/3) ) ) / ( (M2 / a2^(1/3) ) )\n\nBecause the other terms (like star's mass) are same for both.\n\nSo, K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3 )\n\nWe have K1 = 0.03 \u00c5, K2 = 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nSo K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4.\n\nSo,\n\n3/4 = (7/5) * (a2/a1)^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\n(a2/a1)^(1/3 ) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) = (15)/(28) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = (15/28)^3 \u2248 (0.5357)^3 \u2248 0.153.\n\nSo a2 \u2248 0.153 a1.\n\nWait, but wait, that would mean that Planet2 is much closer to the star than Planet1? Because a2 is smaller than a1.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. Because if a2 is smaller than a1, then Planet2 is closer, which would imply a higher equilibrium temperature than Planet1.\n\nBut wait, the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The closer the planet, the higher the temperature.\n\nSo, for equilibrium temperature, T_eq \u221d (R_star/(2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\n\nBut both planets have the same albedo, so (1 - A) is same, cancels out.\n\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) )\n\nWhich simplifies to sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nFrom earlier, a2/a1 \u2248 0.153.\n\nSo sqrt(0.153) \u2248 0.391.\n\nSo T_eq1 \u2248 0.391 * T_eq2 \u2192 so T_eq1 / T_eq2 \u2248 0.391.\n\nWait, but that would make Planet1 much cooler than Planet2. But let's think again, because I might have mixed up a1 and a2.\n\nWait, K1 is 0.03, K2 is 0.04. So K2 is larger than K1. Since K is higher, that would imply either higher mass or smaller a (or both). So if Planet2's K is larger, either because it's more massive or closer, or both.\n\nIn our earlier calculation, a2/a1 = (15/28)^3 \u2248 0.153. So a2 is about 15% of a1. So Planet2 is closer. So its equilibrium temperature should be higher.\n\nSo T_eq2 would be higher than T_eq1.\n\nSo the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 is sqrt(a2/a1) \u2248 sqrt(0.153) \u2248 0.39. So the ratio is about 0.39. But looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.53. Hmm, but 0.39 isn't among the options.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe question says there are two planets orbiting a star. Both have been detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. The star's properties are given: mass is 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times Sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. \n\nPlanet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect, impacting their equilibrium temperature.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, Planet1 to Planet2. The options are A to D.\n\nI remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )^(1/2) or wait, maybe the formula is T_eq = T_star * ( ( R_star/(2a) )^(1/2) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Wait, I'm a bit confused, let me think again.\n\nOh right, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ), where A is the albedo. But wait, I think sometimes the formula is written as T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R/(2d)), where R is the star's radius and d is the planet's orbital distance (a). \n\nBut wait, the question doesn't give the orbital distances. Hmm. But perhaps we can find the orbital distances using the radial velocity method data given.\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift relates to the mass of the planet and the distance of the planet from the star. \n\nThe data given is that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. Planet2 causes a shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. \n\nI think the RV method gives a semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula for K is K = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is 0, so that term drops. \n\nBut I'm not sure how to directly relate the RV shift to the semi-major axis. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period, but without knowing the period, maybe I can find the period using the transit method? Wait, but the question doesn't give any transit timing or period. Hmm.\n\nWait, the transit method gives the planet's orbital period because the transit occurs periodically. But since the question doesn't provide the period, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the RV shift can be used to find the mass function, which can relate to the planet's mass and the semi-major axis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets because the RV shift depends on (M_planet / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/(a)^(1/3)) ) or something like that. Because higher mass planet or closer planet (smaller a) would cause a larger RV shift.\n\nWait, let me think about the RV semi-amplitude K. The formula is K = [ (2\u03c0 G) / (P) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ] * (1/(1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2)) )\n\nSince e is 0, and M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, so the formula simplifies to K \u2248 (2\u03c0 G / P)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / M_*^(2/3) )\n\nBut without knowing P, this might not help directly. Alternatively, Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_*)/(4\u03c0\u00b2). So P^2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a^3)/(G M_*). \n\nSubstituting P into the K equation:\n\nK = [ (2\u03c0 G) / ( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a^3/(G M_* )) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)/M_*^(2/3) )\n\nSimplify inside the cube root:\n\n(2\u03c0 G) * (G M_* )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) ) ) = (2 \u03c0 G^2 M_* ) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) ) = (G^2 M_*) ) / (2 \u03c0 a^3 )\n\nWait, but perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, let's think about the ratio of K for the two planets.\n\nK1 = 0.03 \u00c5, K2 = 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nAssuming that both planets are orbiting the same star (same M_*, same inclination i if sin i is the same; but since both are detected via transit, their inclinations are likely the same, i=90 degrees, so sin i=1.)\n\nSo, K1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/3) ) / (M2 a1^(1/3) )\n\nBecause from the K formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (a^(1/3)) ), considering the other terms are same for both planets.\n\nWait, let me re-express the K formula in terms of a.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G M_* P^2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2). But we can also express P in terms of the orbital period, which is related to the velocity. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation between K and a.\n\nFrom K = (v), which is velocity amplitude. The star's velocity is v = 2\u03c0 a_* sin i / P, where a_* is the star's orbit around the barycenter. But I think a_* = (M_p/(M_* + M_p)) a. Since M_p is much less than M_*, a_* \u2248 (M_p/M_*) a.\n\nSo v \u2248 (2\u03c0 (M_p a) )/( M_* P ) ) \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3)/(G M_* )\n\nSo substituting P into v:\n\nv = (2 \u03c0 M_p a )/( M_* ) * [ (G M_* )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) )^(1/2) ) ]\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\nP^2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3)/(G M_* )\n\nTake square root:\n\nP = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3/(G M_* ))^(1/2 )\n\nSo 1/P = (G M_* )^(1/2) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )^(1/2 )\n\nSo 1/P = (G M_* )^(1/2) ) / ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) )\n\n= sqrt(G M_*) / ( 2 \u03c0 a^(3/2) )\n\nNow, back to v:\n\nv = (2 \u03c0 M_p a )/( M_* ) * [ (G M_* )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) )^(1/2) ) ]\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Alternatively, using K = ( (G M_p sin i )/( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(sqrt(1-e\u00b2))) )\n\nBut since e=0 and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to K = (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) * (2 pi a)^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the ratio K1/K2.\n\nK1/K2 = ( (M1 / a1^(1/3) ) ) / ( (M2 / a2^(1/3) ) )\n\nBecause the other terms (like star's mass) are same for both.\n\nSo, K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3 )\n\nWe have K1 = 0.03 \u00c5, K2 = 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nSo K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4.\n\nSo,\n\n3/4 = (7/5) * (a2/a1)^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\n(a2/a1)^(1/3 ) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) = (15)/(28) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = (15/28)^3 \u2248 (0.5357)^3 \u2248 0.153.\n\nSo a2 \u2248 0.153 a1.\n\nWait, but wait, that would mean that Planet2 is much closer to the star than Planet1? Because a2 is smaller than a1.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. Because if a2 is smaller than a1, then Planet2 is closer, which would imply a higher equilibrium temperature than Planet1.\n\nBut wait, the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The closer the planet, the higher the temperature.\n\nSo, for equilibrium temperature, T_eq \u221d (R_star/(2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\n\nBut both planets have the same albedo, so (1 - A) is same, cancels out.\n\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) )\n\nWhich simplifies to sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nFrom earlier, a2/a1 \u2248 0.153.\n\nSo sqrt(0.153) \u2248 0.391.\n\nSo T_eq1 \u2248 0.391 * T_eq2 \u2192 so T_eq1 / T_eq2 \u2248 0.391.\n\nWait, but that would make Planet1 much cooler than Planet2. But let's think again, because I might have mixed up a1 and a2.\n\nWait, K1 is 0.03, K2 is 0.04. So K2 is larger than K1. Since K is higher, that would imply either higher mass or smaller a (or both). So if Planet2's K is larger, either because it's more massive or closer, or both.\n\nIn our earlier calculation, a2/a1 = (15/28)^3 \u2248 0.153. So a2 is about 15% of a1. So Planet2 is closer. So its equilibrium temperature should be higher.\n\nSo T_eq2 would be higher than T_eq1.\n\nSo the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 is sqrt(a2/a1) \u2248 sqrt(0.153) \u2248 0.39. So the ratio is about 0.39. But looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.53. Hmm, but 0.39 isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express K in terms of a.\n\nAnother approach: since both planets have the same star, let's write the ratio K1/K2 in terms of their masses and semi-major axes.\n\nK1/K2 = ( (M1 sin i) / a1^(1/2) ) / ( (M2 sin i ) / a2^(1/2) ) )\n\nAssuming sin i is the same for both, and M_* is the same.\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWe have K1/K2 = 3/4.\n\nSo,\n\n3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(9/16) = (49/25) * (a2/a1 )\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = (9/16) * (25/49 ) = (225)/(784 ) \u2248 0.287.\n\nSo,\n\na2 \u2248 0.287 a1.\n\nSo Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.\n\nNow, equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a) )\n\nSo T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo,\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536.\n\nSo the ratio is approximately 0.536, which is about 0.53.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh wait, the albedo is the same for both planets, so that part cancels out, I think.\n\nWait, the question says both planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets: Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earths. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earths. Both are in circular orbits.\n\nThe RV method gives the mass of the planet, right? So the mass given must be the minimum mass. But since both are in circular orbits, maybe I don't have to worry about eccentricity affecting the RV semi-amplitude. The RV shift is given for each planet. For Planet1, it's up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nWait, how does RV shift relate to the planet's mass and orbit? The RV semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the star's mass, the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the distance. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) ) / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ), but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I think there's a simplified version when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's.\n\nWait, but in this question, the RV shifts are given. So the RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum Doppler shift observed, which is related to the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. The formula for K is something like K = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (4\u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ (something)) ), but maybe for circular orbits (e=0), and if M_p << M_star, it simplifies.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * a^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )\n\nBut perhaps for a first approximation, since the star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, and the planet masses are much smaller (Earth masses), we can approximate M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So the denominator becomes (M_star)^(2/3) * a^(1/3), but wait, a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the barycenter, which is a = (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) * a_total, where a_total is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think differently. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * ( (2\u03c0/P) )^(1/3) ) ] / c\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star) )^(2/3) * ( (2\u03c0/P) )^(1/3) ) ] / c\n\nWait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, I think K is proportional to (M_p sin i) * (P/(M_star^2))^(1/3) ) / (c * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )\n\nBut perhaps for our purposes, we can relate the RV semi-amplitudes of the two planets. Let's denote K1 for Planet1 and K2 for Planet2. Since both planets are causing shifts in the same spectral line, the K is the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift.\n\nThe question gives K1 = 0.03 \u00c5 and K2 = 0.04 \u00c5. But wait, actually, these are the maximum shifts, so K1 = 0.03 \u00c5 and K2 = 0.04 \u00c5. So the ratio K2/K1 = 0.04/0.03 \u2248 1.333.\n\nNow, what determines K? The RV semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination (sin i), but since both are around the same star, and assuming that i is the same (like both planets have the same inclination, which is a big assumption, but perhaps we can proceed), then K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) * a^(1/3)) ) ), because a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n\nK = (v) = ( (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) * (P)^(1/3) ) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^( -1/3 ) ) ) / c\n\nBut since M_p is much less than M_star, we can approximate 1 + M_p/M_star \u2248 1, so:\n\nK \u2248 (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) / c\n\nBut for each planet, their K is given. So for Planet1 and Planet2, their K's are K1 and K2. Let's denote their masses as M1 and M2, periods as P1 and P2. So:\n\nK1 \u221d M1 / (M_star^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )\n\nSimilarly, K2 \u221d M2 / (M_star^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) )\n\nTaking the ratio K2/K1 = (M2 / P2^(1/3)) ) / ( M1 / P1^(1/3) ) )\n\nSo (K2/K1) = (M2/M1) * (P1/P2)^(1/3 )\n\nWe have K2/K1 = 0.04/0.03 = 4/3 \u2248 1.333.\n\nSo,\n\n4/3 = (M2/M1) * (P1/P2)^(1/3 )\n\nWe know M1 =7 Earth masses, M2=5 Earth masses. So M2/M1=5/7 \u2248 0.714.\n\nSo,\n\n4/3 \u2248 (5/7) * (P1/P2)^(1/3 )\n\nSolving for (P1/P2)^(1/3 ) = (4/3) / (5/7) ) = (4/3) * (7/5) ) = (28)/(15) \u2248 1.8667\n\nSo (P1/P2) = (28/15)^3 \u2248 (1.8667)^3 \u2248 approximately 6.466.\n\nSo P1 \u2248 6.466 * P2.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. Let me recheck the steps.\n\nWait, I'm trying to find the ratio of their periods. Because the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, which is determined by their orbital periods (assuming circular orbits, same star, so Kepler's third law applies).\n\nThe formula for Kepler's third law is P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 G M_star )^(-1) * a\u00b3. So a\u00b3 \u221d P\u00b2 * M_star. So a \u221d (P\u00b2 * M_star )^(1/3 )\n\nBut wait, the formula is P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/(G M_star ), so a\u00b3 = (G M_star P\u00b2 )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo a \u221d ( M_star )^(1/3) * P^(2/3 )\n\nSo the distance a is proportional to P^(2/3) * (M_star)^(1/3 )\n\nBut since the star's mass is the same for both planets, a is proportional to P^(2/3 )\n\nSo a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3 )\n\nBut since we have P1 \u2248 6.466 * P2,\n\na1/a2 = (6.466)^(2/3 )\n\nWait, 6.466^(1/3) is approximately 1.866, so squared is about 3.48.\n\nSo a1 \u2248 3.48 a2.\n\nWait, but wait, the equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nBut since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - albedo) term cancels when taking the ratio.\n\nSo the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 is sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(1/(a1/a2) )\n\nSince a1/a2 \u22483.48, then a2/a1 \u2248 1/3.48 \u22480.287.\n\nSo sqrt(0.287) \u22480.536.\n\nSo T_eq1 / T_eq2 \u22480.536, which is approximately 0.53.\n\nWait, but wait, let's think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nBut since A is the same for both, it cancels out when taking the ratio.\n\nSo the ratio is sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich is the same as sqrt( (a2) / (a1) )\n\nWe have a1 = (P1^(2/3) ) * (M_star^(1/3) ) * scaling factor, and a2 similarly.\n\nWait, but from Kepler's third law, for the same star, a\u00b3 \u221d P\u00b2, so a \u221d P^(2/3 )\n\nSo a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3 )\n\nWe found earlier that (P1/P2) \u22486.466, so a1/a2 = (6.466)^(2/3 )\n\nCalculating 6.466^(1/3) is approximately 1.866, so 1.866^2 \u22483.48. So a1 is about 3.48 times a2.\n\nSo a2/a1 = 1/3.48 \u22480.287.\n\nSo sqrt(0.287) \u22480.536. So T_eq1 is about 0.536 times T_eq2, meaning T_eq1 / T_eq2 \u22480.536, so the ratio is approximately 0.53.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nC) ~0.53\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh wait, the albedo is the same for both planets, so that part cancels out, I think.\n\nWait, the question says both planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets: Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earths. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earths. Both are in circular orbits.\n\nThe RV method gives the mass of the planet, right? So the mass given must be the minimum mass. But since both are in circular orbits, maybe I don't have to worry about eccentricity affecting the RV semi-amplitude. The RV shift is given for each planet. For Planet1, it's up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nWait, how does RV shift relate to the planet's mass and orbit? The RV semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the star's mass, the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the distance. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) ) / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ), but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I think there's a simplified version when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's.\n\nWait, but in this question, the RV shifts are given. So the RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum Doppler shift observed, which is related to the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. The formula for K is something like K = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (4\u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ (something)) ), but maybe for circular orbits (e=0), and if M_p << M_star, it simplifies.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * a^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )\n\nBut perhaps for a first approximation, since the star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, and the planet masses are much smaller (Earth masses), we can approximate M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So the denominator becomes (M_star)^(2/3) * a^(1/3), but wait, a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the barycenter, which is a = (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) * a_total, where a_total is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think differently. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * ( (2\u03c0/P) )^(1/3) ) ] / c\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star) )^(2/3) * ( (2\u03c0/P) )^(1/3) ) ] / c\n\nWait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, I think K is proportional to (M_p sin i) * (P/(M_star^2))^(1/3) ) / (c * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )\n\nBut perhaps for our purposes, we can relate the RV semi-amplitudes of the two planets. Let's denote K1 for Planet1 and K2 for Planet2. Since both planets are causing shifts in the same spectral line, the K is the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift.\n\nThe question gives K1 = 0.03 \u00c5 and K2 = 0.04 \u00c5. But wait, actually, these are the maximum shifts, so K1 = 0.03 \u00c5 and K2 = 0.04 \u00c5. So the ratio K2/K1 = 0.04/0.03 \u2248 1.333.\n\nNow, what determines K? The RV semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination (sin i), but since both are around the same star, and assuming that i is the same (like both planets have the same inclination, which is a big assumption, but perhaps we can proceed), then K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) * a^(1/3)) ) ), because a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n\nK = (v) = ( (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) * (P)^(1/3) ) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^( -1/3 ) ) ) / c\n\nBut since M_p is much less than M_star, we can approximate 1 + M_p/M_star \u2248 1, so:\n\nK \u2248 (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) / c\n\nBut for each planet, their K is given. So for Planet1 and Planet2, their K's are K1 and K2. Let's denote their masses as M1 and M2, periods as P1 and P2. So:\n\nK1 \u221d M1 / (M_star^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )\n\nSimilarly, K2 \u221d M2 / (M_star^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) )\n\nTaking the ratio K2/K1 = (M2 / P2^(1/3)) ) / ( M1 / P1^(1/3) ) )\n\nSo (K2/K1) = (M2/M1) * (P1/P2)^(1/3 )\n\nWe have K2/K1 = 0.04/0.03 = 4/3 \u2248 1.333.\n\nSo,\n\n4/3 = (M2/M1) * (P1/P2)^(1/3 )\n\nWe know M1 =7 Earth masses, M2=5 Earth masses. So M2/M1=5/7 \u2248 0.714.\n\nSo,\n\n4/3 \u2248 (5/7) * (P1/P2)^(1/3 )\n\nSolving for (P1/P2)^(1/3 ) = (4/3) / (5/7) ) = (4/3) * (7/5) ) = (28)/(15) \u2248 1.8667\n\nSo (P1/P2) = (28/15)^3 \u2248 (1.8667)^3 \u2248 approximately 6.466.\n\nSo P1 \u2248 6.466 * P2.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. Let me recheck the steps.\n\nWait, I'm trying to find the ratio of their periods. Because the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, which is determined by their orbital periods (assuming circular orbits, same star, so Kepler's third law applies).\n\nThe formula for Kepler's third law is P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 G M_star )^(-1) * a\u00b3. So a\u00b3 \u221d P\u00b2 * M_star. So a \u221d (P\u00b2 * M_star )^(1/3 )\n\nBut wait, the formula is P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/(G M_star ), so a\u00b3 = (G M_star P\u00b2 )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo a \u221d ( M_star )^(1/3) * P^(2/3 )\n\nSo the distance a is proportional to P^(2/3) * (M_star)^(1/3 )\n\nBut since the star's mass is the same for both planets, a is proportional to P^(2/3 )\n\nSo a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3 )\n\nBut since we have P1 \u2248 6.466 * P2,\n\na1/a2 = (6.466)^(2/3 )\n\nWait, 6.466^(1/3) is approximately 1.866, so squared is about 3.48.\n\nSo a1 \u2248 3.48 a2.\n\nWait, but wait, the equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nBut since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - albedo) term cancels when taking the ratio.\n\nSo the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 is sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(1/(a1/a2) )\n\nSince a1/a2 \u22483.48, then a2/a1 \u2248 1/3.48 \u22480.287.\n\nSo sqrt(0.287) \u22480.536.\n\nSo T_eq1 / T_eq2 \u22480.536, which is approximately 0.53.\n\nWait, but wait, let's think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nBut since A is the same for both, it cancels out when taking the ratio.\n\nSo the ratio is sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich is the same as sqrt( (a2) / (a1) )\n\nWe have a1 = (P1^(2/3) ) * (M_star^(1/3) ) * scaling factor, and a2 similarly.\n\nWait, but from Kepler's third law, for the same star, a\u00b3 \u221d P\u00b2, so a \u221d P^(2/3 )\n\nSo a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3 )\n\nWe found earlier that (P1/P2) \u22486.466, so a1/a2 = (6.466)^(2/3 )\n\nCalculating 6.466^(1/3) is approximately 1.866, so 1.866^2 \u22483.48. So a1 is about 3.48 times a2.\n\nSo a2/a1 = 1/3.48 \u22480.287.\n\nSo sqrt(0.287) \u22480.536. So T_eq1 is about 0.536 times T_eq2, meaning T_eq1 / T_eq2 \u22480.536, so the ratio is approximately 0.53.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nC) ~0.53\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by analyzing the given data. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{eq}} = T_{\\text{star}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a}} \\cdot \\left(1 - A\\right)^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T_{\\text{star}}\\) is the star's effective temperature, \\(R_{\\text{star}}\\) is the star's radius, \\(a\\) is the planet's orbital distance, and \\(A\\) is the albedo.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between two planets. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the question is asking.\n\nThe setup is that there are two planets orbiting a star. Both detection methods, transit and radial velocity, have been used. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. So the star is a bit more massive and larger than the Sun, but a similar temperature. \n\nPlanet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times Earth's. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have same albedo, which is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect and thus their equilibrium temperature. \n\nThe problem mentions something about Doppler shifts. Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 \u00c5. Wait, but how does this relate to the planets' orbits or velocities? Oh, right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's motion caused by the planet's orbit. So the Doppler shift gives us the velocity of the star towards and away from us, which is related to the planet's orbital period and mass.\n\nBut the question is about equilibrium temperatures. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the energy balance: incoming stellar radiation equals outgoing thermal radiation. The formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), right? But wait, I should get the exact formula correct. Alternatively, another way to write it is:\n\nTe = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n- Te is the planet's equilibrium temperature\n- T_s is the star's effective temperature\n- R_s is the star's radius\n- a is the planet's orbital distance from the star\n- A is the planet's albedo\n\nBut wait, I think another version of the formula is:\n\nTe = ( ( L * (1 - A) ) / (16 * \u03c0^2 * \u03c3 * D^2) ) )^(1/4)\n\nWhere L is the star's luminosity, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance between the star and planet. Hmm, but L is also given by L = 4\u03c0 R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4. So substituting that into the equation, we can express Te in terms of the star's parameters and the planet's distance and albedo.\n\nAlternatively, another form I've seen is Te = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) * ( (M_star) )^(1/3) )? Wait, no, I think that's for the Hill sphere or something else. Maybe I'm confusing some other formula.\n\nWait, no, the main factors for equilibrium temperature are the star's temperature, the planet's distance, and the planet's albedo. So the key variables are the star's Teff, the planet's distance, and the albedo. Oh, and the planet's radius might affect the energy balance, but in the equilibrium temperature formula, it's the distance and albedo that matter, not the planet's radius. Because the planet's radius affects the cross-sectional area (which is \u03c0 R_p^2) but when calculating energy balance, it's the incident flux (which depends on distance) and the outgoing radiation (which depends on the planet's radius and temperature).\n\nWait, no, the equilibrium temperature formula doesn't depend on the planet's radius, because the radius cancels out in the calculation. Let me think. The incident power is L * (R_p^2 / (4 D^2)), where R_p is the planet's radius. The planet radiates as a blackbody with surface area 4 \u03c0 R_p^2, so the power radiated is 4 \u03c0 R_p^2 \u03c3 Te^4. Setting them equal: L (R_p^2) / (4 D^2) ) = 4 \u03c0 R_p^2 \u03c3 Te^4. The R_p^2 cancels out, so Te depends only on L, D, and albedo. So the planet's radius doesn't affect the equilibrium temperature. So that's good because the question gives the radii, but maybe they're a red herring.\n\nSo the main factors for the equilibrium temperature ratio are the star's Teff, the planet's distance, and albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, that term will cancel out when taking the ratio. So the ratio Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/(a1) ) * ( (R_s / T_s^2 )^(something) )? Wait, no, let's get the correct formula.\n\nWait, L = 4 \u03c0 R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4. So substituting L into the equilibrium temperature formula:\n\nTe = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 D^2 ) ]^(1/4)\n\nSubstituting L:\n\nTe = [ (4 \u03c0 R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4 (1 - A)) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 D^2) ) ]^(1/4)\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n4 \u03c0 R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4 (1-A) divided by 16 \u03c0 \u03c3 D^2.\n\nThe \u03c0 cancels, \u03c3 cancels, 4/16 is 1/4.\n\nSo numerator: R_s^2 T_s^4 (1-A)\nDenominator: 4 D^2\n\nSo inside the brackets: [ R_s^2 T_s^4 (1-A) / (4 D^2) ) ]^(1/4)\n\nWhich can be written as [ (R_s^2) / (4 D^2) ) * T_s^4 (1-A) ]^(1/4)\n\nBreaking it into multiplicative terms:\n\n[ (R_s^2 / (4 D^2)) ]^(1/4) * [ T_s^4 (1-A) ]^(1/4 )\n\nThe first term: [ R_s^2 / (4 D^2) ]^(1/4) = ( R_s / (2 D) )^(1/2 )\n\nThe second term: [ T_s^4 (1-A) ]^(1/4 ) = T_s * (1-A)^(1/4 )\n\nSo putting together:\n\nTe = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2 D) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\n\nSo yes, the formula is Te = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nSo since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term is the same for both, so it will cancel when taking the ratio. So the ratio Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/(a1) ) * sqrt( R_s/(2 D) ) / sqrt( R_s/(2 D) ) ) ?\n\nWait, wait, no. The formula for each planet is:\n\nTe1 = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2 a1) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\nTe2 = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2 a2) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\n\nSo the ratio Te1/Te2 = sqrt( (R_s/(2 a1)) / (R_s/(2 a2)) ) )\n\nWhich simplifies to sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo to find Te1/Te2, I need to find the ratio of their orbital distances, a2/a1, take the square root.\n\nBut how do I find a1 and a2? The problem gives us some data about the Doppler shifts. The Doppler shift (or radial velocity) is related to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The RV method measures the star's velocity as it's pulled by the planet.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula is:\n\nv = \u03bb / c * (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb )\n\nWhere \u0394\u03bb is the shift, \u03bb is the wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe problem says that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5. So for Planet1, \u0394\u03bb = 0.03 \u00c5, \u03bb = 6300 \u00c5.\n\nv1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c\n\nSimilarly, Planet2 induces a shift of 0.04 \u00c5 on the same line, so v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.\n\nBut wait, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The star's velocity is related to the planet's orbital velocity, but in a way that depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. But since we're dealing with the same star for both planets, perhaps we can find a relation between the velocities.\n\nIn the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity is given by:\n\nK = (v * sin i) = ( (2 \u03c0 G ) / (P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )\n\nBut this formula can get complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut since both planets orbit the same star, and assuming that sin i is the same (perhaps the orbits are edge-on, which is common for transiting planets), then perhaps the ratio of the velocities can help us find the ratio of (M_p)^(1/3) / a^(1/2), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the RV method gives us the star's velocity semi-amplitude, which is related to the planet's orbital speed. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The star's velocity K is related to the planet's velocity v_p as K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p.\n\nSo v_p = K * (M_star / M_p )\n\nBut the planet's orbital speed v_p is also given by v_p = 2 \u03c0 a / P, where a is the semi-major axis (distance from the star), and P is the orbital period.\n\nBut without knowing the period, this might not help directly. Alternatively, from Kepler's third law, which states that P^2 = (4 \u03c0^2 / G M_star) a^3. So a^3 = (G M_star P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0^2 )\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to relate the velocities and the orbital distances.\n\nWait, for a circular orbit, the centripetal acceleration is provided by gravity:\n\nv^2 / a = G M_star / a^2\n\nWait, no, v is the planet's orbital speed. The formula is v^2 = G M_star / a, where a is the semi-major axis (distance from the star). So v = sqrt( G M_star / a )\n\nBut the star's velocity K is (M_p / M_star) * v_p, which is (M_p / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star / a )\n\nSo K = (M_p) / sqrt( M_star a )\n\nBecause sqrt( G M_star / a ) multiplied by M_p / M_star gives M_p sqrt( G M_star ) / ( M_star a^(1/2) ) )\n\nWait, let me compute this:\n\nv_p = sqrt( G M_star / a )\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * v_p = M_p * sqrt( G M_star / a ) / M_star = M_p sqrt( G ) / ( sqrt( M_star a ) )\n\nSo K = ( M_p ) / sqrt( M_star a ) ) * sqrt( G )\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to square both sides.\n\nK^2 = ( M_p^2 G ) / ( M_star a )\n\nSo from this, a = ( M_p^2 G ) / ( M_star K^2 )\n\nSince both planets are around the same star, M_star is the same for both. So the ratio of a1 and a2 can be found from the ratio of (M_p^2) / (K^2 )\n\nSo a1 / a2 = ( (M1^2) / K1^2 ) / ( (M2^2) / K2^2 ) ) = ( M1^2 K2^2 ) / ( M2^2 K1^2 )\n\nWait, wait, let's think again.\n\na1 = ( G M_star )^(1/3) * ( (P1^2 ) / (4 \u03c0^2) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nBut I don't have P. Alternatively, using the K relation.\n\nWe have a = ( G M_star ) / (v_p^2 )\n\nBut v_p = 2 \u03c0 a / P. Hmm, but without knowing P, it's tricky.\n\nWait, going back to the K equation:\n\nK = (v_p) * ( M_p / M_star )\n\nSo v_p = K * M_star / M_p\n\nBut v_p is also sqrt( G M_star / a )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( G M_star / a ) = K * ( M_star / M_p )\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nG M_star / a = K^2 * M_star^2 / M_p^2\n\nSolving for a:\n\na = ( G M_star M_p^2 ) / ( K^2 M_star^2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\na = ( G M_p^2 ) / ( K^2 M_star )\n\nSo a = G M_p^2 / ( K^2 M_star )\n\nSince G and M_star are the same for both planets, the ratio a1/a2 is ( M1^2 / K1^2 ) / ( M2^2 / K2^2 )\n\nWhich is ( M1^2 K2^2 ) / ( M2^2 K1^2 )\n\nSo a1/a2 = ( M1^2 K2^2 ) / ( M2^2 K1^2 )\n\nSo the ratio a1/a2 is ( (M1/M2) )^2 * ( K2/K1 )^2 )\n\nBut since a is in the denominator in the equilibrium temperature formula, the ratio Te1/Te2 is sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo let's compute a2/a1 = ( M2^2 K1^2 ) / ( M1^2 K2^2 )\n\nThus, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt( ( M2^2 K1^2 ) / ( M1^2 K2^2 ) ) ) = ( M2 K1 ) / ( M1 K2 )\n\nSo, the ratio is ( M2 K1 ) / ( M1 K2 )\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So to find Te1/Te2, I compute ( M2 K1 ) / ( M1 K2 )\n\nBecause Te is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), and a is proportional to M_p^2 / K^2.\n\nSo let me get the numbers.\n\nGiven:\n\nPlanet1: M1 =7 Earth masses\n\nPlanet2: M2=5 Earth masses\n\nK1 is the radial velocity semi-amplitude for Planet1. K is calculated from the Doppler shift.\n\nThe Doppler shift for Planet1 is 0.03 \u00c5, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nThe line is at 6300 \u00c5, so the velocity shift is v = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb ) * c.\n\nSo K1 = (0.03 /6300) * c\n\nSimilarly, K2 = (0.04/6300) * c\n\nBut since c is the same, it will cancel when taking the ratio.\n\nSo K1 = 0.03 /6300 = 3e-5 / 6300? Wait, no, 0.03 divided by 6300 is 3e-3 /6.3e3? Wait, 0.03 is 3e-2, 6300 is 6.3e3.\n\nSo K1 = 3e-2 /6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5) ) \u2248 4.76e-6 in units where c=1? No, wait, I think it's better to compute the ratio of K1 and K2.\n\nCompute K1/K2 = (0.03 /6300) / (0.04/6300) ) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.\n\nSo K1 = 0.75 K2.\n\nWait, no, wait, K1 is 0.03 /6300, K2 is 0.04 /6300. So K1 = (0.03/0.04) * K2 = 0.75 K2.\n\nSo K1 = 0.75 K2.\n\nNow, the ratio (M2 K1) / (M1 K2) = (5 * 0.75 K2) ) / (7 * K2 )\n\nWait, K2 is in the denominator, and K1 is 0.75 K2, so substituting:\n\n( M2 * K1 ) / ( M1 * K2 ) = (5 * 0.75 K2 ) / (7 * K2 )\n\nThe K2 cancels out:\n\n= (5 * 0.75) /7 = 3.75 /7 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo Te1/Te2 = 0.5357.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.536.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53.\n\nSo the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is about 0.53, so Te1 is about 0.53 times Te2.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the formula. The ratio is (M2 K1) / (M1 K2), right?\n\nYes, because Te1/Te2 = ( M2 K1 ) / ( M1 K2 )\n\nSo, M2=5, M1=7.\n\nK1 is 0.75 K2, so:\n\n(5 * 0.75 K2 ) / (7 * K2 ) = (3.75 K2) / (7 K2 ) = 3.75 /7 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo the ratio is ~0.536, so option C, which is ~0.53.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between two planets. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the question is asking.\n\nThe setup is that there are two planets orbiting a star. Both detection methods, transit and radial velocity, have been used. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. So the star is a bit more massive and larger than the Sun, but a similar temperature. \n\nPlanet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times Earth's. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have same albedo, which is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect and thus their equilibrium temperature. \n\nThe problem mentions something about Doppler shifts. Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 \u00c5. Wait, but how does this relate to the planets' orbits or velocities? Oh, right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's motion caused by the planet's orbit. So the Doppler shift gives us the velocity of the star towards and away from us, which is related to the planet's orbital period and mass.\n\nBut the question is about equilibrium temperatures. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the energy balance: incoming stellar radiation equals outgoing thermal radiation. The formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), right? But wait, I should get the exact formula correct. Alternatively, another way to write it is:\n\nTe = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n- Te is the planet's equilibrium temperature\n- T_s is the star's effective temperature\n- R_s is the star's radius\n- a is the planet's orbital distance from the star\n- A is the planet's albedo\n\nBut wait, I think another version of the formula is:\n\nTe = ( ( L * (1 - A) ) / (16 * \u03c0^2 * \u03c3 * D^2) ) )^(1/4)\n\nWhere L is the star's luminosity, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance between the star and planet. Hmm, but L is also given by L = 4\u03c0 R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4. So substituting that into the equation, we can express Te in terms of the star's parameters and the planet's distance and albedo.\n\nAlternatively, another form I've seen is Te = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) * ( (M_star) )^(1/3) )? Wait, no, I think that's for the Hill sphere or something else. Maybe I'm confusing some other formula.\n\nWait, no, the main factors for equilibrium temperature are the star's temperature, the planet's distance, and the planet's albedo. So the key variables are the star's Teff, the planet's distance, and the albedo. Oh, and the planet's radius might affect the energy balance, but in the equilibrium temperature formula, it's the distance and albedo that matter, not the planet's radius. Because the planet's radius affects the cross-sectional area (which is \u03c0 R_p^2) but when calculating energy balance, it's the incident flux (which depends on distance) and the outgoing radiation (which depends on the planet's radius and temperature).\n\nWait, no, the equilibrium temperature formula doesn't depend on the planet's radius, because the radius cancels out in the calculation. Let me think. The incident power is L * (R_p^2 / (4 D^2)), where R_p is the planet's radius. The planet radiates as a blackbody with surface area 4 \u03c0 R_p^2, so the power radiated is 4 \u03c0 R_p^2 \u03c3 Te^4. Setting them equal: L (R_p^2) / (4 D^2) ) = 4 \u03c0 R_p^2 \u03c3 Te^4. The R_p^2 cancels out, so Te depends only on L, D, and albedo. So the planet's radius doesn't affect the equilibrium temperature. So that's good because the question gives the radii, but maybe they're a red herring.\n\nSo the main factors for the equilibrium temperature ratio are the star's Teff, the planet's distance, and albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, that term will cancel out when taking the ratio. So the ratio Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/(a1) ) * ( (R_s / T_s^2 )^(something) )? Wait, no, let's get the correct formula.\n\nWait, L = 4 \u03c0 R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4. So substituting L into the equilibrium temperature formula:\n\nTe = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 D^2 ) ]^(1/4)\n\nSubstituting L:\n\nTe = [ (4 \u03c0 R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4 (1 - A)) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 D^2) ) ]^(1/4)\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n4 \u03c0 R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4 (1-A) divided by 16 \u03c0 \u03c3 D^2.\n\nThe \u03c0 cancels, \u03c3 cancels, 4/16 is 1/4.\n\nSo numerator: R_s^2 T_s^4 (1-A)\nDenominator: 4 D^2\n\nSo inside the brackets: [ R_s^2 T_s^4 (1-A) / (4 D^2) ) ]^(1/4)\n\nWhich can be written as [ (R_s^2) / (4 D^2) ) * T_s^4 (1-A) ]^(1/4)\n\nBreaking it into multiplicative terms:\n\n[ (R_s^2 / (4 D^2)) ]^(1/4) * [ T_s^4 (1-A) ]^(1/4 )\n\nThe first term: [ R_s^2 / (4 D^2) ]^(1/4) = ( R_s / (2 D) )^(1/2 )\n\nThe second term: [ T_s^4 (1-A) ]^(1/4 ) = T_s * (1-A)^(1/4 )\n\nSo putting together:\n\nTe = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2 D) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\n\nSo yes, the formula is Te = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nSo since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term is the same for both, so it will cancel when taking the ratio. So the ratio Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/(a1) ) * sqrt( R_s/(2 D) ) / sqrt( R_s/(2 D) ) ) ?\n\nWait, wait, no. The formula for each planet is:\n\nTe1 = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2 a1) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\nTe2 = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2 a2) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\n\nSo the ratio Te1/Te2 = sqrt( (R_s/(2 a1)) / (R_s/(2 a2)) ) )\n\nWhich simplifies to sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo to find Te1/Te2, I need to find the ratio of their orbital distances, a2/a1, take the square root.\n\nBut how do I find a1 and a2? The problem gives us some data about the Doppler shifts. The Doppler shift (or radial velocity) is related to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The RV method measures the star's velocity as it's pulled by the planet.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula is:\n\nv = \u03bb / c * (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb )\n\nWhere \u0394\u03bb is the shift, \u03bb is the wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe problem says that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5. So for Planet1, \u0394\u03bb = 0.03 \u00c5, \u03bb = 6300 \u00c5.\n\nv1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c\n\nSimilarly, Planet2 induces a shift of 0.04 \u00c5 on the same line, so v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.\n\nBut wait, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The star's velocity is related to the planet's orbital velocity, but in a way that depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. But since we're dealing with the same star for both planets, perhaps we can find a relation between the velocities.\n\nIn the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity is given by:\n\nK = (v * sin i) = ( (2 \u03c0 G ) / (P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )\n\nBut this formula can get complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut since both planets orbit the same star, and assuming that sin i is the same (perhaps the orbits are edge-on, which is common for transiting planets), then perhaps the ratio of the velocities can help us find the ratio of (M_p)^(1/3) / a^(1/2), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the RV method gives us the star's velocity semi-amplitude, which is related to the planet's orbital speed. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The star's velocity K is related to the planet's velocity v_p as K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p.\n\nSo v_p = K * (M_star / M_p )\n\nBut the planet's orbital speed v_p is also given by v_p = 2 \u03c0 a / P, where a is the semi-major axis (distance from the star), and P is the orbital period.\n\nBut without knowing the period, this might not help directly. Alternatively, from Kepler's third law, which states that P^2 = (4 \u03c0^2 / G M_star) a^3. So a^3 = (G M_star P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0^2 )\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to relate the velocities and the orbital distances.\n\nWait, for a circular orbit, the centripetal acceleration is provided by gravity:\n\nv^2 / a = G M_star / a^2\n\nWait, no, v is the planet's orbital speed. The formula is v^2 = G M_star / a, where a is the semi-major axis (distance from the star). So v = sqrt( G M_star / a )\n\nBut the star's velocity K is (M_p / M_star) * v_p, which is (M_p / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star / a )\n\nSo K = (M_p) / sqrt( M_star a )\n\nBecause sqrt( G M_star / a ) multiplied by M_p / M_star gives M_p sqrt( G M_star ) / ( M_star a^(1/2) ) )\n\nWait, let me compute this:\n\nv_p = sqrt( G M_star / a )\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * v_p = M_p * sqrt( G M_star / a ) / M_star = M_p sqrt( G ) / ( sqrt( M_star a ) )\n\nSo K = ( M_p ) / sqrt( M_star a ) ) * sqrt( G )\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to square both sides.\n\nK^2 = ( M_p^2 G ) / ( M_star a )\n\nSo from this, a = ( M_p^2 G ) / ( M_star K^2 )\n\nSince both planets are around the same star, M_star is the same for both. So the ratio of a1 and a2 can be found from the ratio of (M_p^2) / (K^2 )\n\nSo a1 / a2 = ( (M1^2) / K1^2 ) / ( (M2^2) / K2^2 ) ) = ( M1^2 K2^2 ) / ( M2^2 K1^2 )\n\nWait, wait, let's think again.\n\na1 = ( G M_star )^(1/3) * ( (P1^2 ) / (4 \u03c0^2) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nBut I don't have P. Alternatively, using the K relation.\n\nWe have a = ( G M_star ) / (v_p^2 )\n\nBut v_p = 2 \u03c0 a / P. Hmm, but without knowing P, it's tricky.\n\nWait, going back to the K equation:\n\nK = (v_p) * ( M_p / M_star )\n\nSo v_p = K * M_star / M_p\n\nBut v_p is also sqrt( G M_star / a )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( G M_star / a ) = K * ( M_star / M_p )\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nG M_star / a = K^2 * M_star^2 / M_p^2\n\nSolving for a:\n\na = ( G M_star M_p^2 ) / ( K^2 M_star^2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\na = ( G M_p^2 ) / ( K^2 M_star )\n\nSo a = G M_p^2 / ( K^2 M_star )\n\nSince G and M_star are the same for both planets, the ratio a1/a2 is ( M1^2 / K1^2 ) / ( M2^2 / K2^2 )\n\nWhich is ( M1^2 K2^2 ) / ( M2^2 K1^2 )\n\nSo a1/a2 = ( M1^2 K2^2 ) / ( M2^2 K1^2 )\n\nSo the ratio a1/a2 is ( (M1/M2) )^2 * ( K2/K1 )^2 )\n\nBut since a is in the denominator in the equilibrium temperature formula, the ratio Te1/Te2 is sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo let's compute a2/a1 = ( M2^2 K1^2 ) / ( M1^2 K2^2 )\n\nThus, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt( ( M2^2 K1^2 ) / ( M1^2 K2^2 ) ) ) = ( M2 K1 ) / ( M1 K2 )\n\nSo, the ratio is ( M2 K1 ) / ( M1 K2 )\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So to find Te1/Te2, I compute ( M2 K1 ) / ( M1 K2 )\n\nBecause Te is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), and a is proportional to M_p^2 / K^2.\n\nSo let me get the numbers.\n\nGiven:\n\nPlanet1: M1 =7 Earth masses\n\nPlanet2: M2=5 Earth masses\n\nK1 is the radial velocity semi-amplitude for Planet1. K is calculated from the Doppler shift.\n\nThe Doppler shift for Planet1 is 0.03 \u00c5, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nThe line is at 6300 \u00c5, so the velocity shift is v = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb ) * c.\n\nSo K1 = (0.03 /6300) * c\n\nSimilarly, K2 = (0.04/6300) * c\n\nBut since c is the same, it will cancel when taking the ratio.\n\nSo K1 = 0.03 /6300 = 3e-5 / 6300? Wait, no, 0.03 divided by 6300 is 3e-3 /6.3e3? Wait, 0.03 is 3e-2, 6300 is 6.3e3.\n\nSo K1 = 3e-2 /6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5) ) \u2248 4.76e-6 in units where c=1? No, wait, I think it's better to compute the ratio of K1 and K2.\n\nCompute K1/K2 = (0.03 /6300) / (0.04/6300) ) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.\n\nSo K1 = 0.75 K2.\n\nWait, no, wait, K1 is 0.03 /6300, K2 is 0.04 /6300. So K1 = (0.03/0.04) * K2 = 0.75 K2.\n\nSo K1 = 0.75 K2.\n\nNow, the ratio (M2 K1) / (M1 K2) = (5 * 0.75 K2) ) / (7 * K2 )\n\nWait, K2 is in the denominator, and K1 is 0.75 K2, so substituting:\n\n( M2 * K1 ) / ( M1 * K2 ) = (5 * 0.75 K2 ) / (7 * K2 )\n\nThe K2 cancels out:\n\n= (5 * 0.75) /7 = 3.75 /7 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo Te1/Te2 = 0.5357.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.536.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53.\n\nSo the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is about 0.53, so Te1 is about 0.53 times Te2.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the formula. The ratio is (M2 K1) / (M1 K2), right?\n\nYes, because Te1/Te2 = ( M2 K1 ) / ( M1 K2 )\n\nSo, M2=5, M1=7.\n\nK1 is 0.75 K2, so:\n\n(5 * 0.75 K2 ) / (7 * K2 ) = (3.75 K2) / (7 K2 ) = 3.75 /7 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo the ratio is ~0.536, so option C, which is ~0.53.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:\n\n\\[\nT_e = T_s \\sqrt{\\frac{R_s}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(T_s\\) is the star's effective temperature,\n- \\(R_s\\) is the star's radius,\n- \\(a\\) is the planet's orbital distance,\n- \\(A\\) is the planet's albedo.\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo (\\(A\\)), the \\((1 - A)^{1/4}\\) term cancels out when taking the ratio of equilibrium temperatures.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question here about planets orbiting a star and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.\n\nAlright, so the setup: there's a star with mass 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times the Sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. Two planets are orbiting it. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the problem says both have the same albedo, so that cancels out in the ratio.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the equilibrium temperature formula. I remember it's something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. But since albedo is the same, it'll cancel when taking the ratio. So the ratio will depend on the square root of (R_star/(2a)) for each planet, but inverted because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).\n\nWait, no, the formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - a) )^0.25. So when taking the ratio T1/T2, the T_star and (1 - a) terms will cancel out. So the ratio would be sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ) because when you divide the two, R_star cancels and 2 cancels. So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).\n\nBut wait, I need to find the ratio T1/T2. So I need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances.\n\nHow do I get a1 and a2? The question mentions the RV method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by some formula. Let me recall: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is equal to (v) where v = ( (G(M_star) )^(1/3) * sin i ) / ( ( (M_p + M_star)^(2/3) ) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (1 AU)^0.5) ) * ( (1/(2\u03c0)) )^(-1/3) )... Wait, maybe I should think about the formula more simply.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, I remember that for the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ), but for planets, M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So K \u2248 (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * some constants.\n\nWait, but in this problem, we have the RV shifts for each planet. The problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5. Similarly, Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 \u00c5. So the RV semi-amplitude K1 is 0.03 \u00c5, and K2 is 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nBut wait, the RV shift is measured in velocity, but the problem gives it in terms of \u00c5ngstr\u00f6ms. Oh, right! The Doppler shift in wavelength (\u0394\u03bb) is related to the velocity (v) by the formula \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c. So the velocity v is c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb). But since the wavelength \u03bb is 6300 \u00c5, the shift for Planet1 is 0.03 \u00c5, so \u0394\u03bb = 0.03. So v1 = c * (0.03 / 6300). Similarly for Planet2, v2 = c * (0.04 /6300).\n\nBut wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is v. So K1 = 0.03 / 6300 * c. Similarly for K2. Let me compute the ratio K1/K2. K1/K2 = (0.03) / (0.04) = 3/4.\n\nBut wait, since K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ), and assuming sin i is similar for both planets (like i\u224890\u00b0, edge-on), and that the period P is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. So, Kepler's law says P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G(M_star)) a\u00b3. So P = ( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_star) )^(1/2). So P^(1/3) = ( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_star) )^(1/6 ) ) = (a)^0.5 / ( (G M_star/(4\u03c0\u00b2)) )^(1/6 ) ) Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to express P in terms of a.\n\nAlternatively, since both planets are around the same star, the mass of the star is same for both. So, for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3)) ). But from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star). So P = ( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star) )^(1/2 ). So P^(1/3) = [ (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 ) = ( a^(3) )^(1/6 ) ) / [ (G M_star/(4\u03c0\u00b2) )^(1/6) ) ].\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to relate a1 and a2 by their periods. Let me see.\n\nLet me define the ratio K1/K2 = (M1 / P1^(1/3)) ) / (M2 / P2^(1/3)) )\n\nBut K1/K2 = 3/4.\n\nSo (M1/M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3) ) = 3/4.\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3 / M_star. Since M_star is same for both planets, P1\u00b2 \u221d a1\u00b3, and P2\u00b2 \u221d a2\u00b3. So P1/P2 = (a1/a2)^(3/2).\n\nSo (P2/P1) = (a2/a1)^(3/2).\n\nSubstituting into the earlier equation:\n\n(M1/M2) * ( (a2/a1)^(3/2) )^(1/3) ) = 3/4.\n\nSimplify the exponents: (3/2) * (1/3) )= 1/2.\n\nSo (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^0.5 = 3/4.\n\nWe can rearrange this as (a2/a1)^0.5 = (3/4) * (M2/M1).\n\nSince M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5. So M2/M1 = 5/7 \u2248 0.7143.\n\nSo (a2/a1)^0.5 = (3/4) * (5/7) = (15)/(28) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSquaring both sides gives a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 \u2248 (225)/(784) \u2248 0.2868.\n\nSo a2 \u2248 0.2868 a1.\n\nAlternatively, a1 = a2 / 0.2868 \u2248 3.48 a2.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I think I might have messed up the substitution. Let me go back.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n(M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^0.5 = 3/4.\n\nSo (a2/a1)^0.5 = (3/4) * (M2/M1).\n\nWait, M2 is 5, M1 is7, so M2/M1 =5/7.\n\nSo (a2/a1)^0.5 = (3/4) * (5/7) )= (15)/(28) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo (a2/a1) = (15/28)^2 \u2248 (225)/(784) \u2248 0.2868.\n\nSo a2 = 0.2868 a1.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if a2 is smaller than a1, then Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1. But then, Planet2 would have a higher equilibrium temperature because it's closer. But in the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, T1/T2, if a2 < a1, then a2/a1 < 1, so sqrt(a2/a1) <1, so T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) <1. So T1 would be lower than T2.\n\nBut wait, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So T \u221d 1/sqrt(a). So T1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2 a1)) * ( (1 - a) )^0.25.\n\nSo T1 / T2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) )\n\nBecause T is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a) ), so the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because R_star is same for both.\n\nWait, no: the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_p = T_star * sqrt( (R_star) / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25.\n\nSo T1 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a1)) * (1 - a)^0.25.\n\nT2 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a2)) * (1 - a)^0.25.\n\nSo T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause sqrt(R/(2a1)) / sqrt(R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) )\n\nSo from earlier, a2/a1 \u2248 0.2868, so sqrt(0.2868) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo T1 / T2 \u2248 0.5357. So the ratio T1 : T2 is approximately 0.5357, which is about 0.536.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which would be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. I think I might have a mistake in the way I applied the RV formula. Let me double-check.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2\u03c0 G) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 AU) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe an easier way is to use the formula:\n\nK = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut for exoplanets, M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So,\n\nK \u2248 (27 pi G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the simplified version where K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )\n\nSo, K1/K2 = (M1 P2^(1/3)) / (M2 P1^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, no, because K is proportional to (M_p) / ( P^(1/3) ), assuming same M_star. So K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )\n\nFrom earlier, I have K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.\n\nSo,\n\n3/4 = (M1 / M2) * (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_star )\n\nSo P1\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a1\u00b3) / (G M_star )\n\nP2\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a2\u00b3) / (G M_star )\n\nSo P2 / P1 = (a2/a1)^(3/2 )\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n3/4 = (7/5) * ( (a2/a1)^(3/2) )^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify the exponent: (3/2) * (1/3) )= 1/2.\n\nSo,\n\n3/4 = (7/5) * (a2/a1)^(1/2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 5/7:\n\n(3/4) * (5/7) )= (a2/a1)^(1/2 )\n\nWhich is (15)/(28) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = (15/28)^2 = 225/784 \u2248 0.2868.\n\nSo a2 = 0.2868 a1.\n\nThus, the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is about 0.53 times that of Planet2.\n\nSo the ratio T1:T2 is approximately 0.53, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question here about planets orbiting a star and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.\n\nAlright, so the setup: there's a star with mass 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times the Sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. Two planets are orbiting it. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the problem says both have the same albedo, so that cancels out in the ratio.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the equilibrium temperature formula. I remember it's something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. But since albedo is the same, it'll cancel when taking the ratio. So the ratio will depend on the square root of (R_star/(2a)) for each planet, but inverted because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).\n\nWait, no, the formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - a) )^0.25. So when taking the ratio T1/T2, the T_star and (1 - a) terms will cancel out. So the ratio would be sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ) because when you divide the two, R_star cancels and 2 cancels. So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).\n\nBut wait, I need to find the ratio T1/T2. So I need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances.\n\nHow do I get a1 and a2? The question mentions the RV method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by some formula. Let me recall: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is equal to (v) where v = ( (G(M_star) )^(1/3) * sin i ) / ( ( (M_p + M_star)^(2/3) ) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (1 AU)^0.5) ) * ( (1/(2\u03c0)) )^(-1/3) )... Wait, maybe I should think about the formula more simply.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, I remember that for the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ), but for planets, M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So K \u2248 (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * some constants.\n\nWait, but in this problem, we have the RV shifts for each planet. The problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5. Similarly, Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 \u00c5. So the RV semi-amplitude K1 is 0.03 \u00c5, and K2 is 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nBut wait, the RV shift is measured in velocity, but the problem gives it in terms of \u00c5ngstr\u00f6ms. Oh, right! The Doppler shift in wavelength (\u0394\u03bb) is related to the velocity (v) by the formula \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c. So the velocity v is c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb). But since the wavelength \u03bb is 6300 \u00c5, the shift for Planet1 is 0.03 \u00c5, so \u0394\u03bb = 0.03. So v1 = c * (0.03 / 6300). Similarly for Planet2, v2 = c * (0.04 /6300).\n\nBut wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is v. So K1 = 0.03 / 6300 * c. Similarly for K2. Let me compute the ratio K1/K2. K1/K2 = (0.03) / (0.04) = 3/4.\n\nBut wait, since K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ), and assuming sin i is similar for both planets (like i\u224890\u00b0, edge-on), and that the period P is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. So, Kepler's law says P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G(M_star)) a\u00b3. So P = ( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_star) )^(1/2). So P^(1/3) = ( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_star) )^(1/6 ) ) = (a)^0.5 / ( (G M_star/(4\u03c0\u00b2)) )^(1/6 ) ) Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to express P in terms of a.\n\nAlternatively, since both planets are around the same star, the mass of the star is same for both. So, for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3)) ). But from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star). So P = ( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star) )^(1/2 ). So P^(1/3) = [ (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 ) = ( a^(3) )^(1/6 ) ) / [ (G M_star/(4\u03c0\u00b2) )^(1/6) ) ].\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to relate a1 and a2 by their periods. Let me see.\n\nLet me define the ratio K1/K2 = (M1 / P1^(1/3)) ) / (M2 / P2^(1/3)) )\n\nBut K1/K2 = 3/4.\n\nSo (M1/M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3) ) = 3/4.\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3 / M_star. Since M_star is same for both planets, P1\u00b2 \u221d a1\u00b3, and P2\u00b2 \u221d a2\u00b3. So P1/P2 = (a1/a2)^(3/2).\n\nSo (P2/P1) = (a2/a1)^(3/2).\n\nSubstituting into the earlier equation:\n\n(M1/M2) * ( (a2/a1)^(3/2) )^(1/3) ) = 3/4.\n\nSimplify the exponents: (3/2) * (1/3) )= 1/2.\n\nSo (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^0.5 = 3/4.\n\nWe can rearrange this as (a2/a1)^0.5 = (3/4) * (M2/M1).\n\nSince M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5. So M2/M1 = 5/7 \u2248 0.7143.\n\nSo (a2/a1)^0.5 = (3/4) * (5/7) = (15)/(28) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSquaring both sides gives a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 \u2248 (225)/(784) \u2248 0.2868.\n\nSo a2 \u2248 0.2868 a1.\n\nAlternatively, a1 = a2 / 0.2868 \u2248 3.48 a2.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I think I might have messed up the substitution. Let me go back.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n(M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^0.5 = 3/4.\n\nSo (a2/a1)^0.5 = (3/4) * (M2/M1).\n\nWait, M2 is 5, M1 is7, so M2/M1 =5/7.\n\nSo (a2/a1)^0.5 = (3/4) * (5/7) )= (15)/(28) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo (a2/a1) = (15/28)^2 \u2248 (225)/(784) \u2248 0.2868.\n\nSo a2 = 0.2868 a1.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if a2 is smaller than a1, then Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1. But then, Planet2 would have a higher equilibrium temperature because it's closer. But in the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, T1/T2, if a2 < a1, then a2/a1 < 1, so sqrt(a2/a1) <1, so T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) <1. So T1 would be lower than T2.\n\nBut wait, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So T \u221d 1/sqrt(a). So T1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2 a1)) * ( (1 - a) )^0.25.\n\nSo T1 / T2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) )\n\nBecause T is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a) ), so the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because R_star is same for both.\n\nWait, no: the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_p = T_star * sqrt( (R_star) / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25.\n\nSo T1 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a1)) * (1 - a)^0.25.\n\nT2 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a2)) * (1 - a)^0.25.\n\nSo T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause sqrt(R/(2a1)) / sqrt(R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) )\n\nSo from earlier, a2/a1 \u2248 0.2868, so sqrt(0.2868) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo T1 / T2 \u2248 0.5357. So the ratio T1 : T2 is approximately 0.5357, which is about 0.536.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which would be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. I think I might have a mistake in the way I applied the RV formula. Let me double-check.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2\u03c0 G) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 AU) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe an easier way is to use the formula:\n\nK = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut for exoplanets, M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So,\n\nK \u2248 (27 pi G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the simplified version where K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )\n\nSo, K1/K2 = (M1 P2^(1/3)) / (M2 P1^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, no, because K is proportional to (M_p) / ( P^(1/3) ), assuming same M_star. So K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )\n\nFrom earlier, I have K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.\n\nSo,\n\n3/4 = (M1 / M2) * (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_star )\n\nSo P1\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a1\u00b3) / (G M_star )\n\nP2\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a2\u00b3) / (G M_star )\n\nSo P2 / P1 = (a2/a1)^(3/2 )\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n3/4 = (7/5) * ( (a2/a1)^(3/2) )^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify the exponent: (3/2) * (1/3) )= 1/2.\n\nSo,\n\n3/4 = (7/5) * (a2/a1)^(1/2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 5/7:\n\n(3/4) * (5/7) )= (a2/a1)^(1/2 )\n\nWhich is (15)/(28) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = (15/28)^2 = 225/784 \u2248 0.2868.\n\nSo a2 = 0.2868 a1.\n\nThus, the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is about 0.53 times that of Planet2.\n\nSo the ratio T1:T2 is approximately 0.53, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:\n\n\\[\nT_p = T_{\\text{star}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a}} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\text{albedo}\\right)^{0.25}\n\\]\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio depends on the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances from the star.\n\nThe orbital distances \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) can be determined using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \\(K\\) is proportional to:\n\n\\[\nK \\propto \\frac{M_p}{P^{1/3}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(M_p\\) is the planet's mass and \\(P\\) is its orbital period.

Taking the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{M_1 / a_1^{1/2}}{M_2 / a_2^{1/2}} = \\frac{M_1}{M_2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(M_1 = 7 \\, M_{\\text{Earth}}\\), \\(M_2 = 5 \\, M_{\\text{Earth}}\\), and \\(\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}\\), we solve:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{7}{5} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{15}{28}\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{15}{28}\\right)^2 = \\frac{225}{784} \\approx 0.2868\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{0.2868} \\approx 0.5357\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately \\(0.53\\), which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Hmm, let's read it again. Two planets are orbiting a star, and we have various parameters for both the star and the planets. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, right?\n\nWait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. I remember the formula is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16 * \u03c0^2 * sigma * a^2) ) )^(1/4) or maybe it's based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Oh wait, the equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is usually given by T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) ), assuming the planet is a perfect black body and there's no atmosphere or albedo effect. Oh wait, but the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so that cancels out. So I don't need to worry about that factor.\n\nSo the formula should be T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ). Or wait, another version I remember is T = T_star * ( R_star / (2a) )^(1/2). Because the star's flux at the planet's distance is proportional to (R_star / a)^2, and the planet's outgoing flux is sigma T^4, so setting them equal gives T^4 proportional to (L/(16 pi a^2 sigma)), but L is proportional to R_star^2 T_star^4. Hmm, maybe that's getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for equilibrium temperature can be written as T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ). Right, that's the one I think I should use here.\n\nSo I need to find the ratio T1 / T2. So that would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because when you take the ratio, the R_star and 2 cancel out. So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ). So T1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a1)), T2 = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a2)).\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) * (2a2/R_star) )) = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, so the ratio depends on the square root of the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes. So if a1 is larger than a2, then T1 is smaller than T2.\n\nBut how do I find the semi-major axes a1 and a2? Well, the problem gives us information from the radial velocity method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift, which depends on the mass of the planet and the velocity of the star. But I'm not sure if I can directly get the semi-major axes from the given Doppler shifts.\n\nWait, the problem states that Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while Planet2 causes a shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Oh, wait, but wait\u2014the forbidden line at 6300 \u00c5? No, the star's Teff is 6300 K, but the [OI] line is at 6300 \u00c5. Hmm, but how does that tie into the RV shifts?\n\nThe Doppler shift in the RV method is given by delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star toward or away from us. The RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity. So the shift in wavelength is delta_lambda = K * (lambda / c).\n\nWait, but the problem gives the shift in Angstroms. So for Planet1, the shift is 0.03 \u00c5, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nBut wait, the RV shift is K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )) ), but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ). Hmm, but I don't have the period, but perhaps I can relate the RV shifts to the masses and the periods, but without knowing the periods, perhaps I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes another way.\n\nWait, but another approach: The RV method gives the velocity of the star, which is related to the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. The formula is:\n\nK = (v_star) = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut without the period, that might not help. Alternatively, I can consider the mass function and the Doppler semi-amplitude.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes using the RV shifts. Because K is proportional to (M_planet) / (a_planet)^(1/2) ), since for a circular orbit, the velocity is v = (2 pi a) / P, and from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3)/(G(M_star + M_planet)) ). But since the planet's mass is much less than the star's, M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star.\n\nSo P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_star)\n\nSo v = 2 pi a / P = sqrt( G M_star / a ) )\n\nSo K, the semi-amplitude, is (v_star) = (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet, where v_planet is the planet's velocity. But since v_planet = sqrt( G M_star / a ), then v_star = (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star / a ) ) = (M_planet) / sqrt( M_star a )\n\nSo K = (M_planet) / sqrt( M_star a )\n\nBut wait, M_planet is much less than M_star, so maybe M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star. So I think that's correct.\n\nSo K is proportional to M_planet / sqrt( a )\n\nBut in this problem, the RV shifts are given as 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5 for Planet1 and Planet2 respectively. But wait, the Doppler shift delta_lambda is related to K via delta_lambda = K * (lambda / c ), where lambda is the wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nWait, the [OI] line is at 6300 \u00c5, so lambda is 6300 \u00c5. So delta_lambda for each planet is given, and K can be calculated as:\n\ndelta_lambda = (K * lambda) / c\n\nSo K = (delta_lambda * c) / lambda\n\nSo for Planet1, K1 = (0.03 \u00c5 * c) / 6300 \u00c5\n\nAnd for Planet2, K2 = (0.04 \u00c5 * c) / 6300 \u00c5\n\nBut c is the speed of light, which is the same for both. So the ratio of K1 to K2 is (0.03) / (0.04) ) = 3/4.\n\nSo K1/K2 = 3/4.\n\nNow, from earlier, K is proportional to M_planet / sqrt( a )\n\nSo K1/K2 = (M1 / sqrt(a1)) ) / (M2 / sqrt(a2)) ) = (M1/M2) * sqrt(a2/a1)\n\nWe have K1/K2 = 3/4.\n\nM1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses. So M1/M2 = 7/5.\n\nSo:\n\n(7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 3/4\n\nWe can solve for sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) = (15)/(28) \u2248 0.5357\n\nSo sqrt( a2 / a1 ) \u2248 0.5357 \u2192 a2/a1 \u2248 (0.5357)^2 \u2248 0.287\n\nSo a2 = 0.287 a1 \u2192 a1 = a2 / 0.287 \u2248 3.48 a2.\n\nWait, but I think I may have made a mistake. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, K1 is for Planet1, so K1 = (M1) / sqrt(a1) * some constant.\n\nSimilarly, K2 = (M2) / sqrt(a2) * same constant.\n\nSo K1/K2 = (M1 / sqrt(a1)) ) / (M2 / sqrt(a2)) ) = (M1/M2) * sqrt(a2/a1)\n\nWe have K1/K2 = 3/4.\n\nSo (7/5) * sqrt(a2/a1) = 3/4 \u2192 sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) * (5/7) )= 15/(28) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo sqrt(a2/a1)= 0.5357 \u2192 a2/a1= (0.5357)^2 \u2248 0.287. So a2 is about 0.287 times a1.\n\nSo a1 is larger than a2. So Planet1 is farther away from the star than Planet2.\n\nNow, going back to the equilibrium temperature ratio. Earlier, I found that T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) \u2192 because T is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a) )\n\nWait, because T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ), T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a2) )\n\nSo T1 / T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nFrom earlier, a2/a1 = 0.287 \u2192 so T1/T2 = sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536.\n\nWait, but that would mean Planet1 is cooler than Planet2.\n\nWait, but I thought T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so if a1 > a2, T1 < T2, so T1/T2 < 1. So that would make sense. So T1 is about 0.536 times T2. So the ratio is about 0.536.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53, so that's the closest.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.\n\nSo, let's recheck the steps.\n\n1. The Doppler shifts are given for each planet. The [OI] line is at 6300 \u00c5. So delta_lambda is 0.03 and 0.04 for Planets 1 and 2 respectively.\n\n2. K is calculated as (delta_lambda * c) / lambda. Since lambda is the same for both (6300 \u00c5), the ratio K1/K2 is (0.03/0.04) = 3/4.\n\n3. K is proportional to (M_planet) / sqrt(a), so (M1 / sqrt(a1)) / (M2 / sqrt(a2)) ) = 3/4.\n\n4. M1 is 7, M2 is 5. So (7/5) * sqrt(a2/a1) = 3/4 \u2192 sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4)*(5/7) = 15/28 \u2248 0.5357 \u2192 a2/a1 \u2248 (0.5357)^2 \u2248 0.287.\n\n5. So a1 is about 3.48 a2 (since 1/0.287 \u2248 3.48).\n\n6. The equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a1) \u2192 sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 is approximately 0.536, which is close to option C, which is ~0.53.\n\nWait, but let me think again. I think the RV semi-amplitude K is actually given by K = ( (27 * pi G ) / (8 c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, another approach: K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But since we don't have the periods, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach.\n\nWait, another point: The star's mass is 1.5 times the Sun. So M_star = 1.5 M_sun.\n\nWait, does that affect the calculation? Because in the formula K = (M_planet) / sqrt(a) ) * something, but perhaps I should include the mass of the star.\n\nWait, let me think again about the formula for K. The correct formula is:\n\nK = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * c) )\n\nWait, perhaps I should get the correct expression for K.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is:\n\nK = (v) = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/c )\n\nBut this is getting complicated, and without knowing the orbital periods, perhaps it's better to find the ratio using the mass and the RV semi-amplitude.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can express a in terms of the period using Kepler's law. The period P is given by P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G (M_* + M_p) )\n\nAssuming M_p << M_*, then P^2 \u2248 (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_*) )\n\nSo a^3 = (G M_* P^2) / (4 pi^2 )\n\nBut without knowing P, perhaps I can express a in terms of K.\n\nWait, K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(c)) ) * ( (P/(2 pi)) )^(-1/3 )\n\nHmm, perhaps that's a better approach.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to relate a to the RV semi-amplitude K.\n\nWait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )\n\nBut since M_p is much less than M_*, M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, so K \u2248 ( (2 pi G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) )\n\nBut again, without P, this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a ratio of a1 and a2 using K1 and K2.\n\nWait, but earlier I found that a2/a1 is approximately 0.287, which gives a ratio of T1/T2 as ~0.536.\n\nSo that points to option C, which is ~0.53.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Hmm, let's read it again. Two planets are orbiting a star, and we have various parameters for both the star and the planets. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, right?\n\nWait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. I remember the formula is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16 * \u03c0^2 * sigma * a^2) ) )^(1/4) or maybe it's based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Oh wait, the equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is usually given by T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) ), assuming the planet is a perfect black body and there's no atmosphere or albedo effect. Oh wait, but the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so that cancels out. So I don't need to worry about that factor.\n\nSo the formula should be T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ). Or wait, another version I remember is T = T_star * ( R_star / (2a) )^(1/2). Because the star's flux at the planet's distance is proportional to (R_star / a)^2, and the planet's outgoing flux is sigma T^4, so setting them equal gives T^4 proportional to (L/(16 pi a^2 sigma)), but L is proportional to R_star^2 T_star^4. Hmm, maybe that's getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for equilibrium temperature can be written as T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ). Right, that's the one I think I should use here.\n\nSo I need to find the ratio T1 / T2. So that would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because when you take the ratio, the R_star and 2 cancel out. So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ). So T1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a1)), T2 = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a2)).\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) * (2a2/R_star) )) = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, so the ratio depends on the square root of the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes. So if a1 is larger than a2, then T1 is smaller than T2.\n\nBut how do I find the semi-major axes a1 and a2? Well, the problem gives us information from the radial velocity method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift, which depends on the mass of the planet and the velocity of the star. But I'm not sure if I can directly get the semi-major axes from the given Doppler shifts.\n\nWait, the problem states that Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while Planet2 causes a shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Oh, wait, but wait\u2014the forbidden line at 6300 \u00c5? No, the star's Teff is 6300 K, but the [OI] line is at 6300 \u00c5. Hmm, but how does that tie into the RV shifts?\n\nThe Doppler shift in the RV method is given by delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star toward or away from us. The RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity. So the shift in wavelength is delta_lambda = K * (lambda / c).\n\nWait, but the problem gives the shift in Angstroms. So for Planet1, the shift is 0.03 \u00c5, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nBut wait, the RV shift is K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )) ), but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ). Hmm, but I don't have the period, but perhaps I can relate the RV shifts to the masses and the periods, but without knowing the periods, perhaps I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes another way.\n\nWait, but another approach: The RV method gives the velocity of the star, which is related to the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. The formula is:\n\nK = (v_star) = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut without the period, that might not help. Alternatively, I can consider the mass function and the Doppler semi-amplitude.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes using the RV shifts. Because K is proportional to (M_planet) / (a_planet)^(1/2) ), since for a circular orbit, the velocity is v = (2 pi a) / P, and from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3)/(G(M_star + M_planet)) ). But since the planet's mass is much less than the star's, M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star.\n\nSo P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_star)\n\nSo v = 2 pi a / P = sqrt( G M_star / a ) )\n\nSo K, the semi-amplitude, is (v_star) = (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet, where v_planet is the planet's velocity. But since v_planet = sqrt( G M_star / a ), then v_star = (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star / a ) ) = (M_planet) / sqrt( M_star a )\n\nSo K = (M_planet) / sqrt( M_star a )\n\nBut wait, M_planet is much less than M_star, so maybe M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star. So I think that's correct.\n\nSo K is proportional to M_planet / sqrt( a )\n\nBut in this problem, the RV shifts are given as 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5 for Planet1 and Planet2 respectively. But wait, the Doppler shift delta_lambda is related to K via delta_lambda = K * (lambda / c ), where lambda is the wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nWait, the [OI] line is at 6300 \u00c5, so lambda is 6300 \u00c5. So delta_lambda for each planet is given, and K can be calculated as:\n\ndelta_lambda = (K * lambda) / c\n\nSo K = (delta_lambda * c) / lambda\n\nSo for Planet1, K1 = (0.03 \u00c5 * c) / 6300 \u00c5\n\nAnd for Planet2, K2 = (0.04 \u00c5 * c) / 6300 \u00c5\n\nBut c is the speed of light, which is the same for both. So the ratio of K1 to K2 is (0.03) / (0.04) ) = 3/4.\n\nSo K1/K2 = 3/4.\n\nNow, from earlier, K is proportional to M_planet / sqrt( a )\n\nSo K1/K2 = (M1 / sqrt(a1)) ) / (M2 / sqrt(a2)) ) = (M1/M2) * sqrt(a2/a1)\n\nWe have K1/K2 = 3/4.\n\nM1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses. So M1/M2 = 7/5.\n\nSo:\n\n(7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 3/4\n\nWe can solve for sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) = (15)/(28) \u2248 0.5357\n\nSo sqrt( a2 / a1 ) \u2248 0.5357 \u2192 a2/a1 \u2248 (0.5357)^2 \u2248 0.287\n\nSo a2 = 0.287 a1 \u2192 a1 = a2 / 0.287 \u2248 3.48 a2.\n\nWait, but I think I may have made a mistake. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, K1 is for Planet1, so K1 = (M1) / sqrt(a1) * some constant.\n\nSimilarly, K2 = (M2) / sqrt(a2) * same constant.\n\nSo K1/K2 = (M1 / sqrt(a1)) ) / (M2 / sqrt(a2)) ) = (M1/M2) * sqrt(a2/a1)\n\nWe have K1/K2 = 3/4.\n\nSo (7/5) * sqrt(a2/a1) = 3/4 \u2192 sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) * (5/7) )= 15/(28) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo sqrt(a2/a1)= 0.5357 \u2192 a2/a1= (0.5357)^2 \u2248 0.287. So a2 is about 0.287 times a1.\n\nSo a1 is larger than a2. So Planet1 is farther away from the star than Planet2.\n\nNow, going back to the equilibrium temperature ratio. Earlier, I found that T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) \u2192 because T is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a) )\n\nWait, because T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ), T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a2) )\n\nSo T1 / T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nFrom earlier, a2/a1 = 0.287 \u2192 so T1/T2 = sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536.\n\nWait, but that would mean Planet1 is cooler than Planet2.\n\nWait, but I thought T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so if a1 > a2, T1 < T2, so T1/T2 < 1. So that would make sense. So T1 is about 0.536 times T2. So the ratio is about 0.536.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53, so that's the closest.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.\n\nSo, let's recheck the steps.\n\n1. The Doppler shifts are given for each planet. The [OI] line is at 6300 \u00c5. So delta_lambda is 0.03 and 0.04 for Planets 1 and 2 respectively.\n\n2. K is calculated as (delta_lambda * c) / lambda. Since lambda is the same for both (6300 \u00c5), the ratio K1/K2 is (0.03/0.04) = 3/4.\n\n3. K is proportional to (M_planet) / sqrt(a), so (M1 / sqrt(a1)) / (M2 / sqrt(a2)) ) = 3/4.\n\n4. M1 is 7, M2 is 5. So (7/5) * sqrt(a2/a1) = 3/4 \u2192 sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4)*(5/7) = 15/28 \u2248 0.5357 \u2192 a2/a1 \u2248 (0.5357)^2 \u2248 0.287.\n\n5. So a1 is about 3.48 a2 (since 1/0.287 \u2248 3.48).\n\n6. The equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a1) \u2192 sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 is approximately 0.536, which is close to option C, which is ~0.53.\n\nWait, but let me think again. I think the RV semi-amplitude K is actually given by K = ( (27 * pi G ) / (8 c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, another approach: K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But since we don't have the periods, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach.\n\nWait, another point: The star's mass is 1.5 times the Sun. So M_star = 1.5 M_sun.\n\nWait, does that affect the calculation? Because in the formula K = (M_planet) / sqrt(a) ) * something, but perhaps I should include the mass of the star.\n\nWait, let me think again about the formula for K. The correct formula is:\n\nK = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * c) )\n\nWait, perhaps I should get the correct expression for K.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is:\n\nK = (v) = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/c )\n\nBut this is getting complicated, and without knowing the orbital periods, perhaps it's better to find the ratio using the mass and the RV semi-amplitude.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can express a in terms of the period using Kepler's law. The period P is given by P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G (M_* + M_p) )\n\nAssuming M_p << M_*, then P^2 \u2248 (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_*) )\n\nSo a^3 = (G M_* P^2) / (4 pi^2 )\n\nBut without knowing P, perhaps I can express a in terms of K.\n\nWait, K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(c)) ) * ( (P/(2 pi)) )^(-1/3 )\n\nHmm, perhaps that's a better approach.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to relate a to the RV semi-amplitude K.\n\nWait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )\n\nBut since M_p is much less than M_*, M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, so K \u2248 ( (2 pi G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) )\n\nBut again, without P, this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a ratio of a1 and a2 using K1 and K2.\n\nWait, but earlier I found that a2/a1 is approximately 0.287, which gives a ratio of T1/T2 as ~0.536.\n\nSo that points to option C, which is ~0.53.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{eq}} = T_{\\text{star}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a}}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(T_{\\text{eq}}\\) is proportional to \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a}}\\), meaning the equilibrium temperature decreases as the semi-major axis \\(a\\) increases.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, the question gives me two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and a Teff of 6300 K. The planets have their own masses and radii: Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with 1.3 Earth radii.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were perfectly balanced between incoming energy and outgoing radiation. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. But wait, since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - albedo) part will cancel out when taking the ratio, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nBut wait, the problem also mentions the Doppler shifts from the RV method. Oh right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The shift depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. But since both planets are causing shifts, I think the shifts are used to find their masses or orbital periods. Wait, no, the question is about equilibrium temperature, which depends on the planet's distance from the star, right? So I need to find the orbital distances (semi-major axes) of each planet.\n\nHmm, how do I get the semi-major axes from the given Doppler shifts? Oh, I remember that the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) )) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way using the Doppler shift data.\n\nWait, the problem states that Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 \u00c5. Since the line is at 6300 \u00c5, the shift is a fraction of the wavelength. So the Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is the fractional change. So for Planet1, \u0394\u03bb is 0.03 \u00c5, and \u03bb is 6300 \u00c5. So the fractional shift is 0.03 / 6300 \u2248 4.76e-6.\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2, 0.04 /6300 \u2248 6.349e-6.\n\nWait, but Doppler shift is related to velocity. The formula is \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. So v = c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb). Let me compute that.\n\nFor Planet1: v1 = (3e5 km/s) * (0.03 / 6300) = (3e5) * (0.03/6300) = 3e5 * 4.76e-6 \u2248 let's calculate that. 3e5 is 300,000. Multiply by 4.76e-6: 300,000 * 4.76e-6 = 1.428 km/s.\n\nWait, that's in km/s. So K1 is about 1.428 km/s. Similarly for Planet2: v2 = 3e5 * (0.04/6300) = 3e5 * 6.349e-6 \u2248 3e5 * 6.349e-6 = 1.9047 km/s.\n\nSo K1 is 1.428 km/s, K2 is ~1.905 km/s.\n\nWait, but the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude K, which relates to the planet's mass and the orbital period. The formula is K = (v_star) = ( (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) )) )\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use the relation that K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ). But since both planets are around the same star, M_star is same, and I think for this problem, we can assume i is 90 degrees (edge-on orbit) so sin i =1, and same for both. So the K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3) ). Hmm, but I don't know the periods P1 and P2.\n\nWait, but the question is about equilibrium temperature, which depends on the semi-major axis a. So perhaps I can find a for each planet.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) ) / ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5 ), but since albedos are same, that factor cancels. So T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1)) / (R_star/(2 a2)) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1 )\n\nTherefore, I need to find a1 and a2, the semi-major axes.\n\nBut how? Well, since both are in circular orbits, and we have their masses and the star's mass, perhaps we can find the orbital periods using Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_star + M_planet))/(4\u03c0\u00b2). But since M_planet << M_star (for both), we can approximate M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star.\n\nSo a^3 = (G M_star P^2) / (4\u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nBut wait, from RV data, we can find the period P. Because the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the velocity of the star, which depends on the planet's mass, period, and semi-major axis.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (2\u03c0 G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star, so:\n\nK \u2248 ( (2\u03c0 G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) )\n\nLet me rearrange this to solve for P:\n\nK^3 = ( (2\u03c0 G ) / c^3 ) * (M_p^3) / (M_star^2) ) * (1/P )\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me think of the formula for K in terms of a and M_p. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )\n\nLet me cube both sides to get rid of the cube roots:\n\nK^3 = ( (2\u03c0 G ) ) * ( M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 ) ) * (1/( P ) )\n\nSo, solving for P:\n\nP = ( (2\u03c0 G ) * M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 * K^3 ) )\n\nWait, but that seems a bit complicated. Maybe another approach. Let me think about the star's velocity and the planet's orbit.\n\nThe star and planet orbit their mutual center of mass. The star's velocity K is related to the planet's velocity v_p by M_p / M_star = v_p / K. But since M_p << M_star, v_p \u2248 K * (M_star / M_p )\n\nBut perhaps I should think about the orbital period. The orbital period P is the same for both the star and the planet. The star's velocity is K, and the planet's velocity is v_p = (M_star / M_p ) * K.\n\nThe orbital circumference is 2\u03c0 a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So for the planet, v_p = 2\u03c0 a / P.\n\nSo v_p = (2\u03c0 a ) / P = (M_star / M_p ) * K.\n\nSo a = ( (M_star / M_p ) * K * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 )\n\nBut I don't know P yet. Hmm.\n\nWait, but from Kepler's third law, a^3 = ( G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nAgain, since M_p is much smaller than M_star, a^3 \u2248 ( G M_star P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo substituting a from the earlier equation into this:\n\n[ ( (M_star / M_p ) * K * P ) / (2 \u03c0 ) ]^3 = ( G M_star P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nLet me cube the left side:\n\n( (M_star^3 / M_p^3 ) * K^3 * P^3 ) ) / (8 \u03c0^3 ) ) = ( G M_star P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft side: (M_star^3 K^3 P^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 M_p^3 )\n\nRight side: (G M_star P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 \u03c0^3 M_p^3:\n\nM_star^3 K^3 P^3 = 2 G M_star P^2 M_p^3 * \u03c0\n\nWait, let me compute that correctly.\n\nWait, right side: [ G M_star P^2 ] / [4 \u03c0\u00b2 ] multiplied by 8 \u03c0^3 M_p^3:\n\n[ G M_star P^2 * 8 \u03c0^3 M_p^3 ] / [4 \u03c0\u00b2 ] = 2 G M_star P^2 \u03c0 M_p^3\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\nM_star^3 K^3 P^3 = 2 G M_star P^2 \u03c0 M_p^3\n\nDivide both sides by M_star P^2:\n\nM_star^2 K^3 P = 2 G \u03c0 M_p^3\n\nSo, solving for P:\n\nP = (2 G \u03c0 M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 K^3 )\n\nWait, that seems manageable.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. But first, let me get all the constants and values straight.\n\nGiven:\n\nM_star = 1.5 * M_sun\n\nM_sun = 1.988e30 kg.\n\nBut perhaps I can work in solar units.\n\nG is the gravitational constant, 6.674e-11 m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps we can express everything in terms of solar masses and astronomical units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula in terms of the star's mass and planet parameters.\n\nWait, let me think about the formula again.\n\nP = (2 G \u03c0 M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 K^3 )\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right dimensionally. Let me check the units.\n\nG has units of m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2.\n\nM_p is in kg, M_star in kg.\n\nK is in m/s.\n\nSo, numerator: G has m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2. M_p^3 is kg^3.\n\nDenominator: M_star^2 (kg\u00b2) * K^3 (m\u00b3 s\u207b3 )\n\nSo the entire denominator is kg\u00b2 m\u00b3 s\u207b3.\n\nSo numerator: m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2 * kg^3 = m\u00b3 kg\u00b2 s\u207b\u00b2.\n\nDenominator: kg\u00b2 m\u00b3 s\u207b3.\n\nSo overall, (m\u00b3 kg\u00b2 s\u207b\u00b2) / (kg\u00b2 m\u00b3 s\u207b3) ) = s.\n\nWhich is correct, as P is in seconds.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo now, plugging in the values.\n\nBut wait, let's calculate P for both planets.\n\nFirst, for Planet1:\n\nM_p1 =7 Earth masses. 1 Earth mass is about 5.972e24 kg, so M_p1 =7 *5.972e24 = 4.18e25 kg.\n\nM_star =1.5 * M_sun = 1.5 * 1.988e30 kg \u2248 2.982e30 kg.\n\nK1 =1.428 km/s =1428 m/s.\n\nSo P1 = (2 * G * \u03c0 * (M_p1)^3 ) / ( (M_star)^2 * (K1)^3 )\n\nPlugging the numbers in:\n\nG=6.674e-11 m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2\n\nM_p1=4.18e25 kg.\n\nM_star=2.982e30 kg.\n\nK1=1428 m/s.\n\nSo compute numerator: 2 * G * \u03c0 * (4.18e25)^3.\n\nLet me compute (4.18e25)^3: 4.18^3 \u224877.35, and 1e25^3=1e75. So 77.35e75 =7.735e76.\n\nMultiply by 2*G*\u03c0:\n\n2 * 6.674e-11 * 3.1416 \u2248 4.197e-10.\n\nMultiply by 7.735e76:\n\n4.197e-10 *7.735e76 \u2248 3.24e67.\n\nDenominator: (2.982e30)^2 * (1428)^3.\n\nCompute (2.982e30)^2 = approx (3e30)^2=9e60. More precisely, 2.982^2=8.89, so 8.89e60.\n\n(1428)^3: 1428^3 = let's see, 1400^3=2.744e9, 28^3=21952. So 1428^3 = approx (1400 +28)^3. But perhaps I can compute it as 1428 *1428=2,039, 184, then multiply by 1428 again: 2,039,184 *1428 \u2248 2,907,  1428 *2e6 is about 2.856e9. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 1428^3 = (1.428e3)^3 = 1.428^3 *1e9.\n\n1.428^3 \u2248 2.907, so 2.907e9.\n\nSo denominator: 8.89e60 * 2.907e9 = (8.89 *2.907) e69.\n\n8.89 *2.907 \u2248 25.87. So denominator \u224825.87e69 =2.587e70.\n\nSo P1 = numerator / denominator = 3.24e67 / 2.587e70 \u2248 (3.24 /258.7 )e-3 \u2248 0.0125e-3 seconds? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 3.24e67 /2.587e70 = (3.24 /2587) *1e-3.\n\nWait, 3.24 /2587 \u2248 approx 0.00125.\n\nSo 0.00125e-3 = 1.25e-6 seconds? That's way too small. That can't be right. I must have messed up the exponents.\n\nWait, let me recheck the exponents.\n\nNumerator: 2*G*\u03c0*(M_p1^3) \u2192 2 *6.674e-11 *3.1416 \u22484.197e-10. Multiply by (4.18e25)^3=7.735e76 \u2192 4.197e-10 *7.735e76 = approx 3.24e67.\n\nDenominator: (2.982e30)^2=8.89e60, K1^3= (1428)^3= approx 2.907e9 \u2192 8.89e60 *2.907e9=8.89*2.907=25.87e69 \u2192 2.587e70.\n\nSo 3.24e67 / 2.587e70 = (3.24 /2587) ) * 1e-3.\n\nWait, 3.24 /2587 \u2248 0.00125. So 0.00125e-3 = 1.25e-6 seconds. That's about 1.25 microseconds. That can't be right. Planetary periods are days to years, not microseconds.\n\nI must have made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me re-derive it.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 - e^2 )^0.5 )) ) * ( 1 / ( (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )\n\nAssuming circular orbit (e=0), and sin i =1 (edge-on).\n\nSo K = (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * 1/( P^(1/3) )\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for P:\n\nK^3 = ( (2\u03c0 G ) / (c ) ) * ( M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 ) ) * (1 / P )\n\nWait, no, let's cube both sides:\n\nK^3 = ( (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) )^3 * ( M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 ) ) * (1/ P )\n\nSo K^3 = (2\u03c0 G) * ( M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 ) * (1 / P )\n\nSo solving for P:\n\nP = (2 \u03c0 G M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 K^3 )\n\nWait, that's the same formula I had before. So perhaps the mistake is in the exponents or the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of solar masses and astronomical units. Let me see if I can find a version of the formula that uses more convenient units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the relation between K and the semi-major axis.\n\nAnother approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the distance a.\n\nThe formula is K = (v) = (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )\n\nBut I think I can find a relation between a and K.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, a^3 = ( G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nBut again, M_p << M_star, so a^3 \u2248 (G M_star P^2 )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo, a = [ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nBut from the RV formula, K is proportional to (M_p ) / ( P^(1/3) )\n\nSo, combining these:\n\nWe can express P in terms of K.\n\nWait, perhaps substituting P from the RV formula.\n\nWait, from the RV formula:\n\nK = ( (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/( P^(1/3) ) )\n\nSo, K^3 = (2 \u03c0 G ) * ( M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 ) * (1/P )\n\nSo, P = (2 \u03c0 G M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 K^3 )\n\nSame as before. So the same calculation applies.\n\nBut when I plug the numbers, I get a very small P, which can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the exponents somewhere.\n\nLet me compute the denominator again.\n\nDenominator: M_star^2 * K^3.\n\nM_star=1.5 * M_sun =1.5 * 1.988e30 kg = 2.982e30 kg.\n\nSo M_star^2 = (2.982e30)^2 = (2.982)^2 = 8.89, so 8.89e60 kg\u00b2.\n\nK1=1.428 km/s =1428 m/s.\n\nK^3 = (1428)^3 = 1428 *1428 *1428.\n\n1428 *1428 = let's compute:\n\n1428 *1428:\n\n1428 *1000 = 1,428,000\n\n1428 *400 = 571,200 \u2192 1,428,000 +571,200= 1,999,200\n\n1428 *28 = let's compute 1428 *20=28,560 and 1428 *8=11,424 \u2192 28,560+11,424=39,984.\n\nSo 1,999,200 + 39,984 = 2,039,184.\n\nThen 2,039,184 *1428.\n\nHmm, 2,039,184 *1000 =2,039,184,000.\n\n2,039,184 *400= 815,673,600.\n\n2,039,184 *28= let's see, 2,039,184 *20=40,783,680 and 2,039,184 *8=16,313,472 \u2192 40,783,680 +16,313,472=57,097,152.\n\nAdding all together: 2,039,184,000 +815,673,600 = 2,854,857,600 +57,097,152 = 2,911,954,752.\n\nSo K1^3 = 2.911954752e9 m\u00b3/s\u00b3.\n\nDenominator = M_star^2 * K1^3 =8.89e60 kg\u00b2 * 2.911954752e9 (m\u00b3/s\u00b3) )\n\nWait, 8.89e60 * 2.91e9 = 25.9e69.\n\nSo denominator is 2.59e70.\n\nNumerator: 2 * G * \u03c0 * (M_p1)^3.\n\nM_p1=7 Earth masses =7 *5.972e24 kg=4.1804e25 kg.\n\n(M_p1)^3= (4.1804e25)^3.\n\nCompute 4.1804^3 \u22484.18^3\u224877.35.\n\nSo 77.35 * (1e25)^3 =77.35e75=7.735e76.\n\n2 * G * \u03c0 = 2 *6.674e-11 *3.1416 \u22484.197e-10.\n\nSo numerator: 4.197e-10 *7.735e76 = 3.24e67.\n\nSo P1 = 3.24e67 / 2.59e70 \u2248 1.25e-3 seconds.\n\nWait, that's 1.25 milliseconds. That's impossible for a planet's orbital period. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Using the fact that the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital period and the star's mass.\n\nThe formula for K is:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2 )^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( (2 \u03c0 / P )^(1/3) )\n\nBut for small e and sin i=1, this simplifies to:\n\nK = ( ( G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( (2 \u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the formula in terms of the star's velocity and the planet's orbital period.\n\nThe star's velocity K is given by:\n\nK = (2 \u03c0 a_star ) / P,\n\nwhere a_star is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass.\n\nBut a_star = ( M_p / ( M_star + M_p ) ) * a,\n\nwhere a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nSince M_p << M_star, a_star \u2248 ( M_p / M_star ) a.\n\nSo K = (2 \u03c0 a ) / ( M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * ( M_p / ( M_star ) )^(1/3) ) / P^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of a1 and a2 without knowing their exact values.\n\nBecause the equilibrium temperature ratio depends on sqrt(a2/a1), if I can find a1/a2, I can find the temperature ratio.\n\nSo let me think about the ratio of their K values.\n\nWe have K1 and K2, the Doppler shifts.\n\nBut K is proportional to (M_p / ( P^(1/3) )) as M_p << M_star.\n\nBut without knowing P, this might not help directly.\n\nWait, but from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 ) / ( G M_star )\n\nSo P = sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )\n\nThus, P^(1/3) = ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )^(1/6 )\n\nSo substituting into K expression:\n\nK = ( (2 \u03c0 G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/( P^(1/3) ) )\n\n= (2 \u03c0 G )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * ( G M_star/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 ) )^(1/6 )\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to express K in terms of a.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: using the formula for K in terms of the planet's orbital parameters.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( a^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2 )^(0.5) ) )\n\nAssuming e=0 and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK = ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, no, perhaps:\n\nWait, the formula I found online is:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e\u00b2 )^(0.5) )) * ( 1 / ( (2 \u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut again, without knowing e or i, this is tricky. However, since both planets are observed via RV, we can assume i \u224890 degrees, so sin i =1.\n\nSo for both planets, K = ( G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1/( (1 - e\u00b2 )^(0.5) )) * ( 1 / ( (2 \u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) )\n\nAssuming e=0 (circular orbit), and M_p << M_star, this reduces to:\n\nK = ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/( (2 \u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) )\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nK = ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1) * ( P )^(-1/3 )\n\nSo, K = ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * P^(-1/3 )\n\nRearranging to solve for P:\n\nP^(-1/3) = K * ( M_star^(2/3) ) / ( G M_p )\n\nSo,\n\nP = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) K ) ) ]^(3)\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me cube both sides.\n\n( P^(-1/3) )^3 = P^(-1) = [ K * M_star^(2/3) / ( G M_p ) ]^3\n\nSo,\n\nP = [ ( G M_p ) / ( K M_star^(2/3) ) ]^3\n\nAh, that's better.\n\nSo,\n\nP = ( G M_p )^3 / ( K^3 M_star^2 )\n\nSo, that's the formula for the period.\n\nSo, for Planet1:\n\nP1 = ( G * M_p1 )^3 / ( K1^3 * M_star^2 )\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2:\n\nP2 = ( G * M_p2 )^3 / ( K2^3 * M_star^2 )\n\nSo, the ratio P1/P2 = ( (M_p1^3) / K1^3 ) / ( (M_p2^3 ) / K2^3 ) )\n\n= (M_p1^3 / M_p2^3 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 )\n\n= ( (7/5)^3 ) * ( (0.04/0.03)^3 )\n\nBecause M_p1=7, M_p2=5; K1=0.03\u00c5, K2=0.04\u00c5.\n\nWait, but K is in terms of the Doppler shift, which is proportional to velocity. So K2/K1 = (0.04 /6300) / (0.03 /6300) ) = 0.04/0.03 =4/3.\n\nSo,\n\nP1/P2 = ( (7/5)^3 ) * ( (4/3)^3 )\n\nWait, (7/5)^3 is 343/125 =2.744, and (4/3)^3 is 64/27\u22482.370.\n\nSo P1/P2 \u2248 2.744 * 2.370 \u22486.515.\n\nSo P1 is about 6.5 times longer than P2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if a planet is more massive, and assuming same K, it would have a longer period? Or wait, let me think.\n\nWait, K is the RV semi-amplitude. For a given planet mass, a larger K implies a shorter period? Or longer?\n\nWait, no. Let's think about K. K is the star's velocity. For a given planet mass, if the period is shorter, the star has to orbit more quickly, which would imply a higher K.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, P is proportional to (M_p )^3 / (K^3 )\n\nSo, for a given M_p, higher K leads to smaller P.\n\nSo, for Planet1 and Planet2, with M_p1=7, M_p2=5.\n\nK1=0.03, K2=0.04.\n\nSo, P1/P2 = ( (7^3) / (5^3) ) * ( (0.04/0.03)^3 )\n\nWait, no: P1/P2 = ( (M_p1^3 / K1^3 ) ) / ( (M_p2^3 / K2^3 ) )\n\n= (7^3 /5^3 ) * (K2^3 / K1^3 )\n\nSo yes, that's (343/125) * ( (0.04/0.03)^3 )\n\n0.04/0.03 =4/3, so (4/3)^3=64/27\u22482.37.\n\n343/125=2.744.\n\nSo 2.744 * 2.37\u22486.51.\n\nSo P1 is about 6.5 times longer than P2.\n\nNow, using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis a is related to the period P as:\n\na^3 = ( G M_star P^2 )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\na1^3 / a2^3 = ( P1^2 ) / ( P2^2 ) )\n\nSince M_star is same for both.\n\nSo a1/a2 = ( P1 / P2 )^(2/3 )\n\nWe have P1/P2\u22486.51, so (6.51)^(2/3) \u2248 cube root of (6.51^2) = cube root of 42.38 \u2248 3.49.\n\nSo a1 \u22483.49 a2.\n\nWait, but wait, a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet1, and a2 that of Planet2.\n\nWait, if a1 is larger than a2, Planet1 is farther from the star, so it would be colder.\n\nSo equilibrium temperature T is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a) )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) )\n\n= sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWe found a1/a2 \u22483.49, so a2/a1 \u22481/3.49\u22480.2867.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt(0.2867) \u22480.535.\n\nSo the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.535, which is option C (~0.53).\n\nWait, but wait, in the calculation of P1/P2, I may have made a mistake.\n\nLet me recheck the ratio.\n\nP1/P2 = ( (7^3)/(5^3) ) * ( (0.04/0.03)^3 )\n\n= (343/125) * ( (4/3)^3 )\n\n= (2.744) * (64/27) )\n\n64/27\u22482.370.\n\n2.744 *2.370 \u2248 6.51.\n\nSo yes, P1 is about 6.5 times P2.\n\nSo a1^3 / a2^3 = (P1/P2 )^2 \u2248 (6.51)^2 \u224842.38.\n\nSo a1/a2= cube root(42.38 )\u22483.49.\n\nSo a1 is about 3.49 times a2.\n\nSo T1/T2= sqrt( a2 /a1 )= sqrt( 1/3.49 ) \u2248 sqrt(0.2868 )\u22480.535.\n\nSo the ratio is approximately 0.535, which is option C: ~0.53.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, the question gives me two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and a Teff of 6300 K. The planets have their own masses and radii: Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with 1.3 Earth radii.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were perfectly balanced between incoming energy and outgoing radiation. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. But wait, since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - albedo) part will cancel out when taking the ratio, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nBut wait, the problem also mentions the Doppler shifts from the RV method. Oh right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The shift depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. But since both planets are causing shifts, I think the shifts are used to find their masses or orbital periods. Wait, no, the question is about equilibrium temperature, which depends on the planet's distance from the star, right? So I need to find the orbital distances (semi-major axes) of each planet.\n\nHmm, how do I get the semi-major axes from the given Doppler shifts? Oh, I remember that the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) )) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way using the Doppler shift data.\n\nWait, the problem states that Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 \u00c5. Since the line is at 6300 \u00c5, the shift is a fraction of the wavelength. So the Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is the fractional change. So for Planet1, \u0394\u03bb is 0.03 \u00c5, and \u03bb is 6300 \u00c5. So the fractional shift is 0.03 / 6300 \u2248 4.76e-6.\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2, 0.04 /6300 \u2248 6.349e-6.\n\nWait, but Doppler shift is related to velocity. The formula is \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. So v = c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb). Let me compute that.\n\nFor Planet1: v1 = (3e5 km/s) * (0.03 / 6300) = (3e5) * (0.03/6300) = 3e5 * 4.76e-6 \u2248 let's calculate that. 3e5 is 300,000. Multiply by 4.76e-6: 300,000 * 4.76e-6 = 1.428 km/s.\n\nWait, that's in km/s. So K1 is about 1.428 km/s. Similarly for Planet2: v2 = 3e5 * (0.04/6300) = 3e5 * 6.349e-6 \u2248 3e5 * 6.349e-6 = 1.9047 km/s.\n\nSo K1 is 1.428 km/s, K2 is ~1.905 km/s.\n\nWait, but the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude K, which relates to the planet's mass and the orbital period. The formula is K = (v_star) = ( (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) )) )\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use the relation that K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ). But since both planets are around the same star, M_star is same, and I think for this problem, we can assume i is 90 degrees (edge-on orbit) so sin i =1, and same for both. So the K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3) ). Hmm, but I don't know the periods P1 and P2.\n\nWait, but the question is about equilibrium temperature, which depends on the semi-major axis a. So perhaps I can find a for each planet.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) ) / ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5 ), but since albedos are same, that factor cancels. So T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1)) / (R_star/(2 a2)) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1 )\n\nTherefore, I need to find a1 and a2, the semi-major axes.\n\nBut how? Well, since both are in circular orbits, and we have their masses and the star's mass, perhaps we can find the orbital periods using Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_star + M_planet))/(4\u03c0\u00b2). But since M_planet << M_star (for both), we can approximate M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star.\n\nSo a^3 = (G M_star P^2) / (4\u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nBut wait, from RV data, we can find the period P. Because the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the velocity of the star, which depends on the planet's mass, period, and semi-major axis.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (2\u03c0 G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star, so:\n\nK \u2248 ( (2\u03c0 G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) )\n\nLet me rearrange this to solve for P:\n\nK^3 = ( (2\u03c0 G ) / c^3 ) * (M_p^3) / (M_star^2) ) * (1/P )\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me think of the formula for K in terms of a and M_p. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )\n\nLet me cube both sides to get rid of the cube roots:\n\nK^3 = ( (2\u03c0 G ) ) * ( M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 ) ) * (1/( P ) )\n\nSo, solving for P:\n\nP = ( (2\u03c0 G ) * M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 * K^3 ) )\n\nWait, but that seems a bit complicated. Maybe another approach. Let me think about the star's velocity and the planet's orbit.\n\nThe star and planet orbit their mutual center of mass. The star's velocity K is related to the planet's velocity v_p by M_p / M_star = v_p / K. But since M_p << M_star, v_p \u2248 K * (M_star / M_p )\n\nBut perhaps I should think about the orbital period. The orbital period P is the same for both the star and the planet. The star's velocity is K, and the planet's velocity is v_p = (M_star / M_p ) * K.\n\nThe orbital circumference is 2\u03c0 a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So for the planet, v_p = 2\u03c0 a / P.\n\nSo v_p = (2\u03c0 a ) / P = (M_star / M_p ) * K.\n\nSo a = ( (M_star / M_p ) * K * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 )\n\nBut I don't know P yet. Hmm.\n\nWait, but from Kepler's third law, a^3 = ( G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nAgain, since M_p is much smaller than M_star, a^3 \u2248 ( G M_star P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo substituting a from the earlier equation into this:\n\n[ ( (M_star / M_p ) * K * P ) / (2 \u03c0 ) ]^3 = ( G M_star P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nLet me cube the left side:\n\n( (M_star^3 / M_p^3 ) * K^3 * P^3 ) ) / (8 \u03c0^3 ) ) = ( G M_star P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft side: (M_star^3 K^3 P^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 M_p^3 )\n\nRight side: (G M_star P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 \u03c0^3 M_p^3:\n\nM_star^3 K^3 P^3 = 2 G M_star P^2 M_p^3 * \u03c0\n\nWait, let me compute that correctly.\n\nWait, right side: [ G M_star P^2 ] / [4 \u03c0\u00b2 ] multiplied by 8 \u03c0^3 M_p^3:\n\n[ G M_star P^2 * 8 \u03c0^3 M_p^3 ] / [4 \u03c0\u00b2 ] = 2 G M_star P^2 \u03c0 M_p^3\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\nM_star^3 K^3 P^3 = 2 G M_star P^2 \u03c0 M_p^3\n\nDivide both sides by M_star P^2:\n\nM_star^2 K^3 P = 2 G \u03c0 M_p^3\n\nSo, solving for P:\n\nP = (2 G \u03c0 M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 K^3 )\n\nWait, that seems manageable.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. But first, let me get all the constants and values straight.\n\nGiven:\n\nM_star = 1.5 * M_sun\n\nM_sun = 1.988e30 kg.\n\nBut perhaps I can work in solar units.\n\nG is the gravitational constant, 6.674e-11 m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps we can express everything in terms of solar masses and astronomical units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula in terms of the star's mass and planet parameters.\n\nWait, let me think about the formula again.\n\nP = (2 G \u03c0 M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 K^3 )\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right dimensionally. Let me check the units.\n\nG has units of m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2.\n\nM_p is in kg, M_star in kg.\n\nK is in m/s.\n\nSo, numerator: G has m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2. M_p^3 is kg^3.\n\nDenominator: M_star^2 (kg\u00b2) * K^3 (m\u00b3 s\u207b3 )\n\nSo the entire denominator is kg\u00b2 m\u00b3 s\u207b3.\n\nSo numerator: m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2 * kg^3 = m\u00b3 kg\u00b2 s\u207b\u00b2.\n\nDenominator: kg\u00b2 m\u00b3 s\u207b3.\n\nSo overall, (m\u00b3 kg\u00b2 s\u207b\u00b2) / (kg\u00b2 m\u00b3 s\u207b3) ) = s.\n\nWhich is correct, as P is in seconds.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo now, plugging in the values.\n\nBut wait, let's calculate P for both planets.\n\nFirst, for Planet1:\n\nM_p1 =7 Earth masses. 1 Earth mass is about 5.972e24 kg, so M_p1 =7 *5.972e24 = 4.18e25 kg.\n\nM_star =1.5 * M_sun = 1.5 * 1.988e30 kg \u2248 2.982e30 kg.\n\nK1 =1.428 km/s =1428 m/s.\n\nSo P1 = (2 * G * \u03c0 * (M_p1)^3 ) / ( (M_star)^2 * (K1)^3 )\n\nPlugging the numbers in:\n\nG=6.674e-11 m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2\n\nM_p1=4.18e25 kg.\n\nM_star=2.982e30 kg.\n\nK1=1428 m/s.\n\nSo compute numerator: 2 * G * \u03c0 * (4.18e25)^3.\n\nLet me compute (4.18e25)^3: 4.18^3 \u224877.35, and 1e25^3=1e75. So 77.35e75 =7.735e76.\n\nMultiply by 2*G*\u03c0:\n\n2 * 6.674e-11 * 3.1416 \u2248 4.197e-10.\n\nMultiply by 7.735e76:\n\n4.197e-10 *7.735e76 \u2248 3.24e67.\n\nDenominator: (2.982e30)^2 * (1428)^3.\n\nCompute (2.982e30)^2 = approx (3e30)^2=9e60. More precisely, 2.982^2=8.89, so 8.89e60.\n\n(1428)^3: 1428^3 = let's see, 1400^3=2.744e9, 28^3=21952. So 1428^3 = approx (1400 +28)^3. But perhaps I can compute it as 1428 *1428=2,039, 184, then multiply by 1428 again: 2,039,184 *1428 \u2248 2,907,  1428 *2e6 is about 2.856e9. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 1428^3 = (1.428e3)^3 = 1.428^3 *1e9.\n\n1.428^3 \u2248 2.907, so 2.907e9.\n\nSo denominator: 8.89e60 * 2.907e9 = (8.89 *2.907) e69.\n\n8.89 *2.907 \u2248 25.87. So denominator \u224825.87e69 =2.587e70.\n\nSo P1 = numerator / denominator = 3.24e67 / 2.587e70 \u2248 (3.24 /258.7 )e-3 \u2248 0.0125e-3 seconds? Wait, that can't be right.

Multiply by (4.18e25)^3=7.735e76 \u2192 4.197e-10 *7.735e76 = approx 3.24e67.\n\nDenominator: (2.982e30)^2=8.89e60, K1^3= (1428)^3= approx 2.907e9 \u2192 8.89e60 *2.907e9=8.89*2.907=25.87e69 \u2192 2.587e70.\n\nSo 3.24e67 / 2.587e70 = (3.24 /2587) ) * 1e-3.\n\nWait, 3.24 /2587 \u2248 0.00125. So 0.00125e-3 = 1.25e-6 seconds. That's about 1.25 microseconds. That can't be right. Planetary periods are days to years, not microseconds.\n\nI must have made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me re-derive it.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 - e^2 )^0.5 )) ) * ( 1 / ( (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )\n\nAssuming circular orbit (e=0), and sin i =1 (edge-on).\n\nSo K = (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * 1/( P^(1/3) )\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for P:\n\nK^3 = ( (2\u03c0 G ) / (c ) ) * ( M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 ) ) * (1 / P )\n\nWait, no, let's cube both sides:\n\nK^3 = ( (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) )^3 * ( M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 ) ) * (1/ P )\n\nSo K^3 = (2\u03c0 G) * ( M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 ) * (1 / P )\n\nSo solving for P:\n\nP = (2 \u03c0 G M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 K^3 )\n\nWait, that's the same formula I had before. So perhaps the mistake is in the exponents or the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of solar masses and astronomical units. Let me see if I can find a version of the formula that uses more convenient units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the relation between K and the semi-major axis.\n\nAnother approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the distance a.\n\nThe formula is K = (v) = (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )\n\nBut I think I can find a relation between a and K.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, a^3 = ( G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nBut again, M_p << M_star, so a^3 \u2248 (G M_star P^2 )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo, a = [ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nBut from the RV formula, K is proportional to (M_p ) / ( P^(1/3) )\n\nSo, combining these:\n\nWe can express P in terms of K.\n\nWait, perhaps substituting P from the RV formula.\n\nWait, from the RV formula:\n\nK = ( (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/( P^(1/3) ) )\n\nSo, K^3 = (2 \u03c0 G ) * ( M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 ) * (1/P )\n\nSo, P = (2 \u03c0 G M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 K^3 )\n\nSame as before. So the same calculation applies.\n\nBut when I plug the numbers, I get a very small P, which can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the exponents somewhere.\n\nLet me compute the denominator again.\n\nDenominator: M_star^2 * K^3.\n\nM_star=1.5 * M_sun =1.5 * 1.988e30 kg = 2.982e30 kg.\n\nSo M_star^2 = (2.982e30)^2 = (2.982)^2 = 8.89, so 8.89e60 kg\u00b2.\n\nK1=1.428 km/s =1428 m/s.\n\nK^3 = (1428)^3 = 1428 *1428 *1428.\n\n1428 *1428 = let's compute:\n\n1428 *1428:\n\n1428 *1000 = 1,428,000\n\n1428 *400 = 571,200 \u2192 1,428,000 +571,200= 1,999,200\n\n1428 *28 = let's compute 1428 *20=28,560 and 1428 *8=11,424 \u2192 28,560+11,424=39,984.\n\nSo 1,999,200 + 39,984 = 2,039,184.\n\nThen 2,039,184 *1428.\n\nHmm, 2,039,184 *1000 =2,039,184,000.\n\n2,039,184 *400= 815,673,600.\n\n2,039,184 *28= let's see, 2,039,184 *20=40,783,680 and 2,039,184 *8=16,313,472 \u2192 40,783,680 +16,313,472=57,097,152.\n\nAdding all together: 2,039,184,000 +815,673,600 = 2,854,857,600 +57,097,152 = 2,911,954,752.\n\nSo K1^3 = 2.911954752e9 m\u00b3/s\u00b3.\n\nDenominator = M_star^2 * K1^3 =8.89e60 kg\u00b2 * 2.911954752e9 (m\u00b3/s\u00b3) )\n\nWait, 8.89e60 * 2.91e9 = 25.9e69.\n\nSo denominator is 2.59e70.\n\nNumerator: 2 * G * \u03c0 * (M_p1)^3.\n\nM_p1=7 Earth masses =7 *5.972e24 kg=4.1804e25 kg.\n\n(M_p1)^3= (4.1804e25)^3.\n\nCompute 4.1804^3 \u22484.18^3\u224877.35.\n\nSo 77.35 * (1e25)^3 =77.35e75=7.735e76.\n\n2 * G * \u03c0 = 2 *6.674e-11 *3.1416 \u22484.197e-10.\n\nSo numerator: 4.197e-10 *7.735e76 = 3.24e67.\n\nSo P1 = 3.24e67 / 2.59e70 \u2248 1.25e-3 seconds.\n\nWait, that's 1.25 milliseconds. That's impossible for a planet's orbital period. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Using the fact that the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital period and the star's mass.\n\nThe formula for K is:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2 )^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( (2 \u03c0 / P )^(1/3) )\n\nBut for small e and sin i=1, this simplifies to:\n\nK = ( ( G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( (2 \u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the formula in terms of the star's velocity and the planet's orbital period.\n\nThe star's velocity K is given by:\n\nK = (2 \u03c0 a_star ) / P,\n\nwhere a_star is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass.\n\nBut a_star = ( M_p / ( M_star + M_p ) ) * a,\n\nwhere a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nSince M_p << M_star, a_star \u2248 ( M_p / M_star ) a.\n\nSo K = (2 \u03c0 a ) / ( M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * ( M_p / ( M_star ) )^(1/3) ) / P^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of a1 and a2 without knowing their exact values.\n\nBecause the equilibrium temperature ratio depends on sqrt(a2/a1), if I can find a1/a2, I can find the temperature ratio.\n\nSo let me think about the ratio of their K values.\n\nWe have K1 and K2, the Doppler shifts.\n\nBut K is proportional to (M_p / ( P^(1/3) )) as M_p << M_star.\n\nBut without knowing P, this might not help directly.\n\nWait, but from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 ) / ( G M_star )\n\nSo P = sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )\n\nThus, P^(1/3) = ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )^(1/6 )\n\nSo substituting into K expression:\n\nK = ( (2 \u03c0 G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/( P^(1/3) ) )\n\n= (2 \u03c0 G )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * ( G M_star/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 ) )^(1/6 )\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to express K in terms of a.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: using the formula for K in terms of the planet's orbital parameters.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( a^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2 )^(0.5) ) )\n\nAssuming e=0 and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK = ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, no, perhaps:\n\nWait, the formula I found online is:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e\u00b2 )^(0.5) )) * ( 1 / ( (2 \u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut again, without knowing e or i, this is tricky. However, since both planets are observed via RV, we can assume i \u224890 degrees, so sin i =1.\n\nSo for both planets, K = ( G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1/( (1 - e\u00b2 )^(0.5) )) * ( 1 / ( (2 \u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) )\n\nAssuming e=0 (circular orbit), and M_p << M_star, this reduces to:\n\nK = ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/( (2 \u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) )\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nK = ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1) * ( P )^(-1/3 )\n\nSo, K = ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * P^(-1/3 )\n\nRearranging to solve for P:\n\nP^(-1/3) = K * ( M_star^(2/3) ) / ( G M_p )\n\nSo,\n\nP = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) K ) ) ]^(3)\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me cube both sides.\n\n( P^(-1/3) )^3 = P^(-1) = [ K * M_star^(2/3) / ( G M_p ) ]^3\n\nSo,\n\nP = [ ( G M_p ) / ( K M_star^(2/3) ) ]^3\n\nAh, that's better.\n\nSo,\n\nP = ( G M_p )^3 / ( K^3 M_star^2 )\n\nSo, that's the formula for the period.\n\nSo, for Planet1:\n\nP1 = ( G * M_p1 )^3 / ( K1^3 * M_star^2 )\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2:\n\nP2 = ( G * M_p2 )^3 / ( K2^3 * M_star^2 )\n\nSo, the ratio P1/P2 = ( (M_p1^3) / K1^3 ) / ( (M_p2^3 ) / K2^3 ) )\n\n= (M_p1^3 / M_p2^3 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 )\n\n= ( (7/5)^3 ) * ( (0.04/0.03)^3 )\n\nBecause M_p1=7, M_p2=5; K1=0.03\u00c5, K2=0.04\u00c5.\n\nWait, but K is in terms of the Doppler shift, which is proportional to velocity. So K2/K1 = (0.04 /6300) / (0.03 /6300) ) = 0.04/0.03 =4/3.\n\nSo,\n\nP1/P2 = ( (7/5)^3 ) * ( (4/3)^3 )\n\nWait, (7/5)^3 is 343/125 =2.744, and (4/3)^3 is 64/27\u22482.370.\n\nSo P1/P2 \u2248 2.744 * 2.370 \u22486.515.\n\nSo P1 is about 6.5 times longer than P2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if a planet is more massive, and assuming same K, it would have a longer period? Or wait, let me think.\n\nWait, K is the RV semi-amplitude. For a given planet mass, a larger K implies a shorter period? Or longer?\n\nWait, no. Let's think about K. K is the star's velocity. For a given planet mass, if the period is shorter, the star has to orbit more quickly, which would imply a higher K.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, P is proportional to (M_p )^3 / (K^3 )\n\nSo, for a given M_p, higher K leads to smaller P.\n\nSo, for Planet1 and Planet2, with M_p1=7, M_p2=5.\n\nK1=0.03, K2=0.04.\n\nSo, P1/P2 = ( (7^3) / (5^3) ) * ( (0.04/0.03)^3 )\n\nWait, no: P1/P2 = ( (M_p1^3 / K1^3 ) ) / ( (M_p2^3 / K2^3 ) )\n\n= (7^3 /5^3 ) * (K2^3 / K1^3 )\n\nSo yes, that's (343/125) * ( (0.04/0.03)^3 )\n\n0.04/0.03 =4/3, so (4/3)^3=64/27\u22482.37.\n\n343/125=2.744.\n\nSo 2.744 * 2.37\u22486.51.\n\nSo P1 is about 6.5 times longer than P2.\n\nNow, using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis a is related to the period P as:\n\na^3 = ( G M_star P^2 )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\na1^3 / a2^3 = ( P1^2 ) / ( P2^2 ) )\n\nSince M_star is same for both.\n\nSo a1/a2 = ( P1 / P2 )^(2/3 )\n\nWe have P1/P2\u22486.51, so (6.51)^(2/3) \u2248 cube root of (6.51^2) = cube root of 42.38 \u2248 3.49.\n\nSo a1 \u22483.49 a2.\n\nWait, but wait, a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet1, and a2 that of Planet2.\n\nWait, if a1 is larger than a2, Planet1 is farther from the star, so it would be colder.\n\nSo equilibrium temperature T is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a) )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) )\n\n= sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWe found a1/a2 \u22483.49, so a2/a1 \u22481/3.49\u22480.2867.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt(0.2867) \u22480.535.\n\nSo the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.535, which is option C (~0.53).\n\nWait, but wait, in the calculation of P1/P2, I may have made a mistake.\n\nLet me recheck the ratio.\n\nP1/P2 = ( (7^3)/(5^3) ) * ( (0.04/0.03)^3 )\n\n= (343/125) * ( (4/3)^3 )\n\n= (2.744) * (64/27) )\n\n64/27\u22482.370.\n\n2.744 *2.370 \u2248 6.51.\n\nSo yes, P1 is about 6.5 times P2.\n\nSo a1^3 / a2^3 = (P1/P2 )^2 \u2248 (6.51)^2 \u224842.38.\n\nSo a1/a2= cube root(42.38 )\u22483.49.\n\nSo a1 is about 3.49 times a2.\n\nSo T1/T2= sqrt( a2 /a1 )= sqrt( 1/3.49 ) \u2248 sqrt(0.2868 )\u22480.535.\n\nSo the ratio is approximately 0.535, which is option C: ~0.53.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:\n\n\\[\nT = T_{\\text{star}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a}}\n\\]\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the albedo term cancels out when taking the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh, right, albedo is the reflectivity, so if a planet has a higher albedo, it reflects more light and is cooler.\n\nThe question says both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out. So I don't have to worry about that. Now, equilibrium temperature formula, I think it's something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Wait, no, wait. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nOh right, the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where T_s is the star's effective temperature, R_s is its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Oh, but wait, the star's luminosity is the key factor here. Oh, right, Luminosity L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3Teff\u2074. So the star's luminosity is a function of its radius and effective temperature.\n\nBut wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is derived from the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation from the planet. So the star emits L, and the planet intercepts a cross-section area of \u03c0R_p\u00b2. But the planet radiates as a blackbody with surface area 4\u03c0R_p\u00b2. So the energy balance is (L / (4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - A) = 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nWait, let me get that right. The star's luminosity is L = 4\u03c0 R_s\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4. So the flux at the planet's orbit is L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) = (R_s\u00b2 T_eff^4) / a\u00b2. Then, the planet absorbs this flux multiplied by (1 - A) (since A is the albedo, the fraction reflected), so the absorbed power is (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - A) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2. The planet then radiates this as thermal emission, which is 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nPutting it together: (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - A) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4. Simplifying, the R_p\u00b2 terms cancel out. So:\n\n(L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - A) * \u03c0 = 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nWait, let me compute that. So L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) is the flux, multiplied by (1-A)\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 is the absorption. The left side is the energy in, the right is energy out.\n\nSo (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - A) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nDivide both sides by R_p\u00b2: (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - A) * \u03c0 = 4\u03c0 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nMultiply L by (1 - A) \u03c0 / (4\u03c0 a\u00b2) = (1 - A) L/(4 a\u00b2) * 1/(4\u03c0) ? Wait, maybe I should take a step back.\n\nAlternatively, I can write T_p = [ (L (1 - A)) / (16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4). Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe a better approach is to express T_p in terms of the star's parameters and the planet's distance.\n\nWait, another approach: The equilibrium temperature is given by T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). Is that right? Because the star's temperature is T_s, radius R_s, so L is proportional to R_s\u00b2 T_s^4. Then, the flux at distance a is L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) = (R_s\u00b2 T_s^4) / a\u00b2. Then, the planet absorbs (1-A) times that flux. The planet's emitted flux is \u03c3 T_p^4. So:\n\n( (R_s\u00b2 T_s^4) / a\u00b2 ) * (1 - A) /4 = \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nWait, let me check that. The flux from the star at the planet's distance is L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) = (R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4 )/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2). Because L = 4\u03c0 R_s\u00b2 \u03c3 T_s^4.\n\nSo (R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4) / (4\u03c0 a\u00b2) ) * (1 - A) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4. Wait, because the planet intercepts an area of \u03c0 R_p\u00b2, and emits from 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go through the derivation again more carefully.\n\nThe star emits L = 4\u03c0 R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4.\n\nThe planet is at distance a from the star. The flux at that distance is S = L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) = (R_s\u00b2 \u03c3 T_s^4 )/(a\u00b2).\n\nThe planet's cross-sectional area is \u03c0 R_p^2. So the power absorbed is P_abs = S * \u03c0 R_p^2 * (1 - A) = (R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4)/(a\u00b2) ) * \u03c0 R_p^2 (1 - A).\n\nThe planet emits energy as a blackbody: P_emit = 4\u03c0 R_p^2 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nAt equilibrium, P_abs = P_emit.\n\nSo,\n\n(R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4)/(a\u00b2) ) * \u03c0 R_p^2 (1 - A) = 4\u03c0 R_p^2 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nSimplify: the R_p^2 and \u03c3 terms cancel. Divide both sides by \u03c0:\n\n(R_s^2 T_s^4)/(a\u00b2) ) * (1 - A) = 4 T_p^4.\n\nSo T_p^4 = (R_s^2 T_s^4 (1 - A)) / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nTake the fourth root:\n\nT_p = T_s * ( R_s / (2 a ) )^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term is the same for both, so when taking the ratio, it cancels out.\n\nSo the ratio of T_p1 to T_p2 is sqrt( (R_s/(2 a1)) / ( R_s/(2 a2) ) ) )\n\nWait, no, because the ratio is T1/T2 = [ sqrt( R_s/(2a1) ) ] / [ sqrt( R_s/(2 a2) ) ] = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause sqrt( (R_s/(2a1)) / (R_s/(2 a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, let's compute it:\n\nT1 = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2 a1) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\n\nT2 = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2 a2) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_s/(2a1)) / ( R_s/(2a2) ) ) )\n\n= sqrt( (a2) / a1 )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo if planet 1 is closer (smaller a1), its T would be higher. So if a2 > a1, then sqrt(a2/a1) >1, so T1 is lower than T2.\n\nWait, but to find the ratio, I need to know the ratio of their a1 and a2. The question is about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, T1 over T2.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo I need to find the ratio a2/a1, then take the square root.\n\nHow to find a1 and a2?\n\nThe question gives the RV method data. Each planet induces a Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull. The maximum velocity (amplitude) depends on the mass of the planet and the distance of the planet from the star.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2\u03c0))^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe I should recall the formula for RV semi-amplitude. I think the formula is:\n\nK = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )\n\nBut since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator becomes 1. Also, sin i is 1 if the orbit is edge-on, which is the case for the transit method. Because the transit method requires that the planet's orbit is aligned with our line of sight, so i \u2248 90 degrees, so sin i = 1.\n\nWait, but for RV, the semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination. But in this case, both planets are detected via transit, which implies that i is close to 90 degrees, so sin i = 1.\n\nSo for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) a^(2/3) ) )\n\nWait, wait. Let me think of the formula again.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )\n\nBut that's getting complicated. Another approach is to use the formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital distance. I remember that for circular orbits (e=0), the formula simplifies.\n\nAnother way is to express the RV semi-amplitude as:\n\nK = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to relate the semi-major axis a with the RV semi-amplitude K.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider that the RV method gives us the mass function, which depends on the planet's mass, the inclination, and the semi-major axis. But since both planets transit, their inclinations are close to 90 degrees, so sin i \u22481.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a1 and a2) based on the RV data.\n\nWait, the problem says that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 \u00c5, and Planet2 induces a shift of 0.04 \u00c5. These are the semi-amplitudes K of their respective Doppler shifts. So K1 = 0.03 \u00c5, K2=0.04 \u00c5.\n\nI need to find a1 and a2, or their ratio.\n\nI think the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * a^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to write the expression for K in terms of a, M_p, and M_star.\n\nThe formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )\n\nBut since e=0 and sin i=1, it simplifies to:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut I don't know the orbital periods P1 and P2. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but maybe I can relate the periods to the semi-major axes using Kepler's third law. Kepler's law states that P^2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G(M_star + M_p)) a^3.\n\nSince M_p is much less than M_star (since M_p is 7 Earth masses, M_star is 1.5 solar masses. Earth is about 3e-6 solar masses. So 7e-6 / 1.5 is about 4.7e-6, negligible. So M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star.\n\nSo P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/( G M_star )\n\nThus, P = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nBut perhaps substituting back into the K expression will help.\n\nWait, let me try substituting P into K.\n\nK = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star )^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut P is proportional to a^(3/2) / (M_star^(1/2) )\n\nWait, from Kepler's law:\n\nP^2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) / ( G M_star )\n\nSo P = sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) / ( G M_star ) )\n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 / ( G M_star )) )^(1/2 )\n\n= ( (a^3) / (M_star) )^(1/2 ) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G )^(1/2 )\n\nSo 1/P = [ G M_star/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) ) ]^(1/2 )\n\nThus, 1/P^(1/3) = [ G M_star/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) ) ]^(-1/6 )\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe instead, express K in terms of a.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's write the expression for K in terms of a.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * a^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(2 pi))^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a better way. Let me look for a formula that relates K, M_p, a, and M_star.\n\nI found that the formula can be written as:\n\nK = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * a^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) )\n\nBut given that M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_p/M_star is negligible, so 1 + M_p/M_star \u22481. So we can approximate:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) a^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\n= ( G M_p )^(1/3 ) / ( M_star^(1/9) a^(2/9) )\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nK = [ ( G M_p ) / ( ( M_star )^(1/3) a^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= ( G M_p )^(1/3 ) / ( M_star^(1/9) a^(2/9) )\n\nWait, but that seems a bit messy. Maybe it's easier to write in terms of the ratio of K1 and K2.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nK1 = ( ( G M_p1 ) / ( M_star^(1/3) a1^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nSimilarly, K2 = ( ( G M_p2 ) / ( M_star^(1/3) a2^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nTaking the ratio K1/K2:\n\nK1/K2 = [ ( M_p1 a2^(2/3) ) / ( M_p2 a1^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nCubing both sides:\n\n(K1/K2)^3 = ( M_p1 a2^(2/3) ) / ( M_p2 a1^(2/3) )\n\n= ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(2/3 )\n\nLet me rearrange this to solve for (a2/a1)^(2/3):\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3 ) = ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nThen, ( a2/a1 ) = [ ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nWait, let me compute the exponents properly.\n\nWait, from K1/K2:\n\n(K1/K2)^3 = (M_p1 a2^(2/3)) / (M_p2 a1^(2/3)) )\n\n= (M_p1/M_p2) * (a2/a1)^(2/3 )\n\nSo,\n\n(a2/a1)^(2/3) = (K1^3/K2^3) * (M_p2/M_p1 )\n\nTaking both sides to the power of 3/2:\n\n(a2/a1) = [ ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3) = (K1^3 / K2^3) * (M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nTake both sides to the (3/2) power:\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3 * 3/2 ) ) = [ (K1^3 / K2^3) * (M_p2 / M_p1 ) ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na2/a1 = [ (K1^3 / K2^3) * (M_p2 / M_p1 ) ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Let's try again.\n\nLet me take the equation:\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3 ) = ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nSo to solve for (a2/a1), we raise both sides to the power of 3/2:\n\n( a2/a1 ) = [ ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nWait, no, because (x^(a))^b = x^(a*b). So if (a2/a1)^(2/3) = y, then (a2/a1) = y^(3/2).\n\nSo,\n\n(a2/a1) = [ ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nWait, no. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nLet me take the equation:\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3 ) = ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nLet me denote C = ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nSo,\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3) = C\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3/2:\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3 * 3/2 ) ) = C^(3/2 )\n\nSimplify the exponent: 2/3 *3/2 =1.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = C^(3/2 )\n\nWhich is,\n\na2/a1 = [ ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me plug in the numbers.\n\nGiven:\n\nK1 = 0.03 \u00c5\n\nK2 = 0.04 \u00c5\n\nM_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n\nM_p2 =5 Earth masses\n\nM_p1 / M_p2 =7/5 =1.4\n\nCompute ( K1/K2 )^3 = (0.03/0.04)^3 = (3/4)^3 = 27/64 \u22480.421875\n\nThen,\n\nC = (K1^3 / K2^3) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) = (27/64) * (5/7) = (27 *5) / (64 *7 ) = 135 / 448 \u22480.296875\n\nThen,\n\na2/a1 = [ C ]^(3/2 )\n\nWait, no. Earlier, I think I made a mistake. Because the equation was:\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3 ) = C\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = C^(3/2 )\n\nBecause (a2/a1 ) = (C)^(3/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nC = ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\n= (0.03^3 /0.04^3 ) * (5/7 )\n\n= (27e-9 /64e-9 ) * (5/7 )\n\n= (27/64) *5/7 \u2248 (0.421875) * 0.714286 \u22480.2998\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = [ 0.2998 ]^(3/2 )\n\nWhat's 0.2998 to the power 3/2?\n\nHmm, 0.3^1.5 = sqrt(0.3^3) = sqrt(0.027) \u2248 0.1643\n\nWait, 0.3^3 is 0.027, sqrt(0.027)= ~0.1643.\n\nSo a2/a1 \u2248 0.1643.\n\nWait, but that would mean a2 is smaller than a1. But wait, K is higher for Planet2. So does a higher K mean a smaller a?\n\nWait, let's think. K is the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, which depends on how much the star is being pulled towards and away from us. A larger K means a larger velocity, which suggests a more massive planet or a closer orbit (since closer planets would cause a larger wobble).\n\nWait, in our calculation, a2 is smaller than a1. So Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1. But wait, K2 is larger than K1. So that would mean that Planet2 is closer, and thus has a higher K.\n\nHmm, but in our calculation, a2 is less than a1. So Planet2 is closer, which makes sense why K2 is higher.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, a2/a1 = C^(3/2) = (0.2998)^(3/2) \u22480.164. So a2 is about 0.164 times a1. So a1 is about 6 times a2. Hmm, but that would mean that Planet1 is farther away than Planet2.\n\nBut the RV semi-amplitude K is higher for Planet2, which is closer. That makes sense.\n\nSo now, going back to the equilibrium temperature ratio.\n\nWe have T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich is sqrt( 0.164 ) \u2248 0.405.\n\nWait, but wait. Because a2 is less than a1. So a2/a1 is 0.164. So sqrt(0.164) is about 0.405. So T1 is about 0.405 times T2.\n\nWait, but the ratio is T1 over T2. So T1 is about 0.4 times T2.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 0.4. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) ~0.98\n\nB) ~1.30\n\nC) ~0.53\n\nD) ~1.05\n\nHmm, 0.4 isn't in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate C.\n\nWait, K1=0.03, K2=0.04.\n\nSo (K1/K2) = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4 =0.75.\n\nC = (K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\n= ( (0.75)^3 ) * (5/7 )\n\n0.75^3 is 0.421875.\n\n5/7 is approximately 0.714286.\n\nSo 0.421875 * 0.714286 \u2248 0.2998.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, a2/a1 = C^(3/2 ) = (0.2998)^(3/2 )\n\nHmm, 0.2998 is approximately 0.3.\n\nSo 0.3^(3/2) is sqrt(0.3^3) = sqrt(0.027) \u2248 0.1643.\n\nWait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.\n\n0.2998^1.5 = e^(1.5 * ln(0.2998)).\n\nln(0.2998) \u2248-1.219.\n\n1.5 * (-1.219) \u2248-1.8285.\n\ne^-1.8285 \u22480.1607.\n\nSo a2/a1 \u22480.1607.\n\nThus, a1 is about 6.2 times a2.\n\nSo the ratio a2/a1 is about 0.1607.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.1607) \u2248 0.401.\n\nBut the options don't have 0.4. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the formula for K wrong. Let me double-check the RV semi-amplitude formula.\n\nThe correct formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )\n\nBut when e=0 and sin i=1, it's:\n\nK = ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_star, (1 + M_p/M_star ) \u22481.\n\nSo,\n\nK \u2248 ( G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) )\n\nSo,\n\nK = ( G M_p / ( M_star P ) )^(1/3 )\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/( G M_star )\n\nSo, P = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting into K:\n\nK = [ G M_p / ( M_star * (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\nDenominator = M_star * (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\n= M_star^(1) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) a^(3/2) / ( G^(1/2 ) M_star^(1/2) )\n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) a^(3/2) M_star^(1/2) / G^(1/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nK = [ G M_p / ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) a^(3/2) M_star^(1/2) / G^(1/2 ) ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= [ G^(3/2) M_p / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) a^(3/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nHmm, getting a bit messy, but let me try to factor this out.\n\nK = [ ( G^(3/2) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p / ( a^(3/2) M_star^(1/2) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\nG^(3/2) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) = [ G^3 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/2 )\n\nBut perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's consider that the constants can be written as:\n\n[ G^(3/2) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2) ) ] = [ G^3 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/2 )\n\nBut perhaps I should proceed differently.\n\nAnother approach is to express K in terms of a.\n\nFrom the previous step:\n\nK = [ (G M_p ) / ( M_star P ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 / (G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nP = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 / (G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nSubstitute into K:\n\nK = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star * (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= [ ( G M_p ) / ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )^(1/2 ) / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= [ ( G M_p ) * ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )^(1/2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= [ ( G^(3/2) M_p M_star^(1/2) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )^(1/2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nFactor out the exponents:\n\n= [ G^(3/2) M_p M_star^(1/2) / ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= [ G^(3/2) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2) ) * ( M_p M_star^(1/2) ) / a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= [ ( G^3 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) )^(1/2) ) * ( M_p M_star^(1/2) ) / a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nHmm, perhaps this isn't leading me anywhere useful.\n\nLet me try to write K in terms of a.\n\nAssume that K is proportional to (M_p / a^(something)).\n\nWait, from K's expression, after substituting P from Kepler's law, perhaps K is proportional to (M_p / a^(1/2)).\n\nWait, let me think. Let me try to find the relation between K and a.\n\nWait, let me take the expression:\n\nK = ( (G M_p ) / ( ( M_star )^(1/3) a^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nWhich I think is the correct expression.\n\nSo,\n\nK = ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/9) a^(2/9) )\n\nHmm, so K is proportional to ( M_p / a^(2/3) )^(1/3 ) ) = M_p^(1/3) a^(-2/9 )\n\nSo,\n\nK \u221d M_p^(1/3) a^(-2/9 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nK = k * M_p^(1/3) a^(-2/9 )\n\nWhere k is a constant that depends on G and M_star.\n\nSo for both planets, the same k applies.\n\nThus,\n\nK1/K2 = ( M_p1^(1/3) a1^(-2/9) ) / ( M_p2^(1/3) a2^(-2/9) )\n\n= [ ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) ] * [ ( a2/a1 )^(2/9) ]\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = ( (M_p1/M_p2 )^(1/3) ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(2/9) )\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for (a2/a1):\n\nTake both sides to the power of 9/2:\n\n( K1/K2 )^(9/2 ) = [ (M_p1/M_p2 )^(1/3) ) ]^(9/2) * (a2/a1 )\n\nWhich is,\n\n( K1/K2 )^(9/2 ) = ( M_p1/M_p2 )^(3/2 ) * (a2/a1 )\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = ( K1/K2 )^(9/2 ) / ( M_p1/M_p2 )^(3/2 )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nK1=0.03, K2=0.04 \u2192 K1/K2=0.75.\n\nM_p1=7, M_p2=5 \u2192 M_p1/M_p2=1.4.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = (0.75 )^(9/2 ) / (1.4 )^(3/2 )\n\nCompute each part:\n\n0.75^(4.5) \u2192 Let me compute this.\n\n0.75^4 = (0.75^2)^2 = (0.5625)^2 \u22480.3164.\n\n0.75^0.5 = sqrt(0.75) \u22480.8660.\n\nSo 0.75^4.5 = 0.3164 * 0.8660 \u22480.274.\n\n(1.4 )^(1.5 ) = sqrt(1.4^3 ) = sqrt(2.744 ) \u22481.656.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 \u2248 0.274 / 1.656 \u22480.165.\n\nWhich is about the same as before. So a2 is about 0.165 times a1.\n\nThus, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.165 ) \u22480.406.\n\nBut the options don't have 0.4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the equilibrium temperature.\n\nWait, the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nWait, I think I messed up the formula earlier. Let me re-derive it.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula.\n\nThe star's luminosity is L = 4 \u03c0 R_s\u00b2 \u03c3 T_s^4.\n\nThe planet absorbs L/(4 \u03c0 a\u00b2) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 * (1 - A) = L/(4 a\u00b2) * R_p\u00b2 (1 - A)\n\nThe planet emits 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nSetting them equal:\n\nL/(4 a\u00b2) * R_p\u00b2 (1 - A) = 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nCancel R_p\u00b2:\n\nL (1 - A) / (4 a\u00b2 ) = 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nSubstitute L =4 \u03c0 R_s\u00b2 \u03c3 T_s^4:\n\n(4 \u03c0 R_s\u00b2 \u03c3 T_s^4 ) (1 - A) / (4 a\u00b2 ) =4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nSimplify:\n\n( R_s\u00b2 T_s^4 (1 - A) ) / a\u00b2 =4 T_p^4.\n\nSo,\n\nT_p^4 = R_s\u00b2 T_s^4 (1 - A) / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nTake the fourth root:\n\nT_p = T_s * ( R_s / (2 a ) )^(1/2 ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nYes, that's correct. So the ratio is:\n\nT1/T2 = sqrt( ( R_s/(2 a1) ) / ( R_s/(2 a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo back to a2/a1 \u22480.165 \u2192 T1/T2\u22480.406.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have 0.4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the RV calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the correct formula for K.\n\nAnother approach: The RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2 pi) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) ) )\n\nBut again, assuming e=0 and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK = ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_star ) )^(1/3 ) / ( 2 pi )^(1/3 )\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because it doesn't include a.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, another formula I found is:\n\nK = ( ( G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) * (1 + M_p/M_star ) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( ( 1 ) / ( 2 \u03c0 a (1 - e\u00b2) ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's easier to use the ratio of the velocities.\n\nLet me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * a^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, perhaps that's the correct expression.\n\nSo,\n\nK \u221d ( M_p )^(1/3) a^(-2/9 )\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(2/9) )\n\nWe can write:\n\n( K1/K2 ) = ( (7/5 )^(1/3) ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(2/9) )\n\nWe need to find a2/a1.\n\nLet me take the equation:\n\n( K1/K2 ) = ( (7/5 )^(1/3) ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(2/9) )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n( (a2/a1 )^(2/9) ) = ( K1/K2 ) / ( (7/5 )^(1/3) )\n\nRaise both sides to the 9/2 power:\n\na2/a1 = [ ( K1/K2 ) / ( (7/5 )^(1/3) ) ) ]^(9/2 )\n\nCompute each part:\n\nK1/K2 =0.03/0.04=3/4=0.75.\n\n(7/5)^(1/3) \u2248 (1.4)^(0.333) \u22481.119.\n\nSo,\n\n( K1/K2 ) / (7/5 )^(1/3 ) \u22480.75 /1.119 \u22480.670.\n\nNow,\n\n[0.670]^(9/2 )= [0.670]^4.5.\n\nCompute 0.670^4= (0.670^2)^2= (0.4489)^2\u22480.2015.\n\n0.670^0.5\u22480.8185.\n\nSo,\n\n0.670^4.5=0.2015 * 0.8185\u22480.1646.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 \u22480.1646.\n\nWhich brings us back to the same a2/a1 \u22480.1646.\n\nThus, T1/T2 = sqrt(0.1646)= ~0.406.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is T2/T1 instead? Let me check.\n\nIf T1/T2=0.406, then T2/T1=2.46.\n\nBut the options don't have that either.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the closest is option C, 0.53.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance, not the square root of a2/a1.\n\nWait, no, the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2a) ), so the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2/a1 ).\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it numerically.\n\nGiven a2/a1=0.1646, sqrt(0.1646)=0.406.\n\nSo T1 is about 0.406 times T2.\n\nSo T1/T2=0.406, which is approximately 0.4.\n\nBut the options don't have that.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh, right, albedo is the reflectivity, so if a planet has a higher albedo, it reflects more light and is cooler.\n\nThe question says both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out. So I don't have to worry about that. Now, equilibrium temperature formula, I think it's something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Wait, no, wait. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nOh right, the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where T_s is the star's effective temperature, R_s is its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Oh, but wait, the star's luminosity is the key factor here. Oh, right, Luminosity L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3Teff\u2074. So the star's luminosity is a function of its radius and effective temperature.\n\nBut wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is derived from the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation from the planet. So the star emits L, and the planet intercepts a cross-section area of \u03c0R_p\u00b2. But the planet radiates as a blackbody with surface area 4\u03c0R_p\u00b2. So the energy balance is (L / (4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - A) = 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nWait, let me get that right. The star's luminosity is L = 4\u03c0 R_s\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4. So the flux at the planet's orbit is L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) = (R_s\u00b2 T_eff^4) / a\u00b2. Then, the planet absorbs this flux multiplied by (1 - A) (since A is the albedo, the fraction reflected), so the absorbed power is (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - A) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2. The planet then radiates this as thermal emission, which is 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nPutting it together: (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - A) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4. Simplifying, the R_p\u00b2 terms cancel out. So:\n\n(L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - A) * \u03c0 = 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nWait, let me compute that. So L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) is the flux, multiplied by (1-A)\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 is the absorption. The left side is the energy in, the right is energy out.\n\nSo (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - A) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nDivide both sides by R_p\u00b2: (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - A) * \u03c0 = 4\u03c0 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nMultiply L by (1 - A) \u03c0 / (4\u03c0 a\u00b2) = (1 - A) L/(4 a\u00b2) * 1/(4\u03c0) ? Wait, maybe I should take a step back.\n\nAlternatively, I can write T_p = [ (L (1 - A)) / (16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4). Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe a better approach is to express T_p in terms of the star's parameters and the planet's distance.\n\nWait, another approach: The equilibrium temperature is given by T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). Is that right? Because the star's temperature is T_s, radius R_s, so L is proportional to R_s\u00b2 T_s^4. Then, the flux at distance a is L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) = (R_s\u00b2 T_s^4) / a\u00b2. Then, the planet absorbs (1-A) times that flux. The planet's emitted flux is \u03c3 T_p^4. So:\n\n( (R_s\u00b2 T_s^4) / a\u00b2 ) * (1 - A) /4 = \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nWait, let me check that. The flux from the star at the planet's distance is L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) = (R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4 )/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2). Because L = 4\u03c0 R_s\u00b2 \u03c3 T_s^4.\n\nSo (R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4) / (4\u03c0 a\u00b2) ) * (1 - A) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4. Wait, because the planet intercepts an area of \u03c0 R_p\u00b2, and emits from 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go through the derivation again more carefully.\n\nThe star emits L = 4\u03c0 R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4.\n\nThe planet is at distance a from the star. The flux at that distance is S = L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) = (R_s\u00b2 \u03c3 T_s^4 )/(a\u00b2).\n\nThe planet's cross-sectional area is \u03c0 R_p^2. So the power absorbed is P_abs = S * \u03c0 R_p^2 * (1 - A) = (R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4)/(a\u00b2) ) * \u03c0 R_p^2 (1 - A).\n\nThe planet emits energy as a blackbody: P_emit = 4\u03c0 R_p^2 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nAt equilibrium, P_abs = P_emit.\n\nSo,\n\n(R_s^2 \u03c3 T_s^4)/(a\u00b2) ) * \u03c0 R_p^2 (1 - A) = 4\u03c0 R_p^2 \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nSimplify: the R_p^2 and \u03c3 terms cancel. Divide both sides by \u03c0:\n\n(R_s^2 T_s^4)/(a\u00b2) ) * (1 - A) = 4 T_p^4.\n\nSo T_p^4 = (R_s^2 T_s^4 (1 - A)) / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nTake the fourth root:\n\nT_p = T_s * ( R_s / (2 a ) )^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term is the same for both, so when taking the ratio, it cancels out.\n\nSo the ratio of T_p1 to T_p2 is sqrt( (R_s/(2 a1)) / ( R_s/(2 a2) ) ) )\n\nWait, no, because the ratio is T1/T2 = [ sqrt( R_s/(2a1) ) ] / [ sqrt( R_s/(2 a2) ) ] = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause sqrt( (R_s/(2a1)) / (R_s/(2 a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, let's compute it:\n\nT1 = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2 a1) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\n\nT2 = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2 a2) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_s/(2a1)) / ( R_s/(2a2) ) ) )\n\n= sqrt( (a2) / a1 )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo if planet 1 is closer (smaller a1), its T would be higher. So if a2 > a1, then sqrt(a2/a1) >1, so T1 is lower than T2.\n\nWait, but to find the ratio, I need to know the ratio of their a1 and a2. The question is about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, T1 over T2.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo I need to find the ratio a2/a1, then take the square root.\n\nHow to find a1 and a2?\n\nThe question gives the RV method data. Each planet induces a Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull. The maximum velocity (amplitude) depends on the mass of the planet and the distance of the planet from the star.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2\u03c0))^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe I should recall the formula for RV semi-amplitude. I think the formula is:\n\nK = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )\n\nBut since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator becomes 1. Also, sin i is 1 if the orbit is edge-on, which is the case for the transit method. Because the transit method requires that the planet's orbit is aligned with our line of sight, so i \u2248 90 degrees, so sin i = 1.\n\nWait, but for RV, the semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination. But in this case, both planets are detected via transit, which implies that i is close to 90 degrees, so sin i = 1.\n\nSo for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) a^(2/3) ) )\n\nWait, wait. Let me think of the formula again.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )\n\nBut that's getting complicated. Another approach is to use the formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital distance. I remember that for circular orbits (e=0), the formula simplifies.\n\nAnother way is to express the RV semi-amplitude as:\n\nK = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to relate the semi-major axis a with the RV semi-amplitude K.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider that the RV method gives us the mass function, which depends on the planet's mass, the inclination, and the semi-major axis. But since both planets transit, their inclinations are close to 90 degrees, so sin i \u22481.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a1 and a2) based on the RV data.\n\nWait, the problem says that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 \u00c5, and Planet2 induces a shift of 0.04 \u00c5. These are the semi-amplitudes K of their respective Doppler shifts. So K1 = 0.03 \u00c5, K2=0.04 \u00c5.\n\nI need to find a1 and a2, or their ratio.\n\nI think the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * a^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to write the expression for K in terms of a, M_p, and M_star.\n\nThe formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )\n\nBut since e=0 and sin i=1, it simplifies to:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut I don't know the orbital periods P1 and P2. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but maybe I can relate the periods to the semi-major axes using Kepler's third law. Kepler's law states that P^2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G(M_star + M_p)) a^3.\n\nSince M_p is much less than M_star (since M_p is 7 Earth masses, M_star is 1.5 solar masses. Earth is about 3e-6 solar masses. So 7e-6 / 1.5 is about 4.7e-6, negligible. So M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star.\n\nSo P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/( G M_star )\n\nThus, P = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nBut perhaps substituting back into the K expression will help.\n\nWait, let me try substituting P into K.\n\nK = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star )^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut P is proportional to a^(3/2) / (M_star^(1/2) )\n\nWait, from Kepler's law:\n\nP^2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) / ( G M_star )\n\nSo P = sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) / ( G M_star ) )\n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 / ( G M_star )) )^(1/2 )\n\n= ( (a^3) / (M_star) )^(1/2 ) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G )^(1/2 )\n\nSo 1/P = [ G M_star/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) ) ]^(1/2 )\n\nThus, 1/P^(1/3) = [ G M_star/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3) ) ]^(-1/6 )\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe instead, express K in terms of a.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's write the expression for K in terms of a.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * a^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(2 pi))^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a better way. Let me look for a formula that relates K, M_p, a, and M_star.\n\nI found that the formula can be written as:\n\nK = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * a^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) )\n\nBut given that M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_p/M_star is negligible, so 1 + M_p/M_star \u22481. So we can approximate:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) a^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\n= ( G M_p )^(1/3 ) / ( M_star^(1/9) a^(2/9) )\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nK = [ ( G M_p ) / ( ( M_star )^(1/3) a^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= ( G M_p )^(1/3 ) / ( M_star^(1/9) a^(2/9) )\n\nWait, but that seems a bit messy. Maybe it's easier to write in terms of the ratio of K1 and K2.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nK1 = ( ( G M_p1 ) / ( M_star^(1/3) a1^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nSimilarly, K2 = ( ( G M_p2 ) / ( M_star^(1/3) a2^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nTaking the ratio K1/K2:\n\nK1/K2 = [ ( M_p1 a2^(2/3) ) / ( M_p2 a1^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nCubing both sides:\n\n(K1/K2)^3 = ( M_p1 a2^(2/3) ) / ( M_p2 a1^(2/3) )\n\n= ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(2/3 )\n\nLet me rearrange this to solve for (a2/a1)^(2/3):\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3 ) = ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nThen, ( a2/a1 ) = [ ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nWait, let me compute the exponents properly.\n\nWait, from K1/K2:\n\n(K1/K2)^3 = (M_p1 a2^(2/3)) / (M_p2 a1^(2/3)) )\n\n= (M_p1/M_p2) * (a2/a1)^(2/3 )\n\nSo,\n\n(a2/a1)^(2/3) = (K1^3/K2^3) * (M_p2/M_p1 )\n\nTaking both sides to the power of 3/2:\n\n(a2/a1) = [ ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3) = (K1^3 / K2^3) * (M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nTake both sides to the (3/2) power:\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3 * 3/2 ) ) = [ (K1^3 / K2^3) * (M_p2 / M_p1 ) ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na2/a1 = [ (K1^3 / K2^3) * (M_p2 / M_p1 ) ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Let's try again.\n\nLet me take the equation:\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3 ) = ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nSo to solve for (a2/a1), we raise both sides to the power of 3/2:\n\n( a2/a1 ) = [ ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nWait, no, because (x^(a))^b = x^(a*b). So if (a2/a1)^(2/3) = y, then (a2/a1) = y^(3/2).\n\nSo,\n\n(a2/a1) = [ ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nWait, no. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nLet me take the equation:\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3 ) = ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nLet me denote C = ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nSo,\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3) = C\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3/2:\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3 * 3/2 ) ) = C^(3/2 )\n\nSimplify the exponent: 2/3 *3/2 =1.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = C^(3/2 )\n\nWhich is,\n\na2/a1 = [ ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me plug in the numbers.\n\nGiven:\n\nK1 = 0.03 \u00c5\n\nK2 = 0.04 \u00c5\n\nM_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n\nM_p2 =5 Earth masses\n\nM_p1 / M_p2 =7/5 =1.4\n\nCompute ( K1/K2 )^3 = (0.03/0.04)^3 = (3/4)^3 = 27/64 \u22480.421875\n\nThen,\n\nC = (K1^3 / K2^3) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) = (27/64) * (5/7) = (27 *5) / (64 *7 ) = 135 / 448 \u22480.296875\n\nThen,\n\na2/a1 = [ C ]^(3/2 )\n\nWait, no. Earlier, I think I made a mistake. Because the equation was:\n\n( a2/a1 )^(2/3 ) = C\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = C^(3/2 )\n\nBecause (a2/a1 ) = (C)^(3/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nC = ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\n= (0.03^3 /0.04^3 ) * (5/7 )\n\n= (27e-9 /64e-9 ) * (5/7 )\n\n= (27/64) *5/7 \u2248 (0.421875) * 0.714286 \u22480.2998\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = [ 0.2998 ]^(3/2 )\n\nWhat's 0.2998 to the power 3/2?\n\nHmm, 0.3^1.5 = sqrt(0.3^3) = sqrt(0.027) \u2248 0.1643\n\nWait, 0.3^3 is 0.027, sqrt(0.027)= ~0.1643.\n\nSo a2/a1 \u2248 0.1643.\n\nWait, but that would mean a2 is smaller than a1. But wait, K is higher for Planet2. So does a higher K mean a smaller a?\n\nWait, let's think. K is the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, which depends on how much the star is being pulled towards and away from us. A larger K means a larger velocity, which suggests a more massive planet or a closer orbit (since closer planets would cause a larger wobble).\n\nWait, in our calculation, a2 is smaller than a1. So Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1. But wait, K2 is larger than K1. So that would mean that Planet2 is closer, and thus has a higher K.\n\nHmm, but in our calculation, a2 is less than a1. So Planet2 is closer, which makes sense why K2 is higher.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, a2/a1 = C^(3/2) = (0.2998)^(3/2) \u22480.164. So a2 is about 0.164 times a1. So a1 is about 6 times a2. Hmm, but that would mean that Planet1 is farther away than Planet2.\n\nBut the RV semi-amplitude K is higher for Planet2, which is closer. That makes sense.\n\nSo now, going back to the equilibrium temperature ratio.\n\nWe have T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich is sqrt( 0.164 ) \u2248 0.405.\n\nWait, but wait. Because a2 is less than a1. So a2/a1 is 0.164. So sqrt(0.164) is about 0.405. So T1 is about 0.405 times T2.\n\nWait, but the ratio is T1 over T2. So T1 is about 0.4 times T2.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 0.4. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) ~0.98\n\nB) ~1.30\n\nC) ~0.53\n\nD) ~1.05\n\nHmm, 0.4 isn't in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate C.\n\nWait, K1=0.03, K2=0.04.\n\nSo (K1/K2) = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4 =0.75.\n\nC = (K1^3 / K2^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\n= ( (0.75)^3 ) * (5/7 )\n\n0.75^3 is 0.421875.\n\n5/7 is approximately 0.714286.\n\nSo 0.421875 * 0.714286 \u2248 0.2998.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, a2/a1 = C^(3/2 ) = (0.2998)^(3/2 )\n\nHmm, 0.2998 is approximately 0.3.\n\nSo 0.3^(3/2) is sqrt(0.3^3) = sqrt(0.027) \u2248 0.1643.\n\nWait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.\n\n0.2998^1.5 = e^(1.5 * ln(0.2998)).\n\nln(0.2998) \u2248-1.219.\n\n1.5 * (-1.219) \u2248-1.8285.\n\ne^-1.8285 \u22480.1607.\n\nSo a2/a1 \u22480.1607.\n\nThus, a1 is about 6.2 times a2.\n\nSo the ratio a2/a1 is about 0.1607.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.1607) \u2248 0.401.\n\nBut the options don't have 0.4. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the formula for K wrong. Let me double-check the RV semi-amplitude formula.\n\nThe correct formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )\n\nBut when e=0 and sin i=1, it's:\n\nK = ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_star, (1 + M_p/M_star ) \u22481.\n\nSo,\n\nK \u2248 ( G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) )\n\nSo,\n\nK = ( G M_p / ( M_star P ) )^(1/3 )\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/( G M_star )\n\nSo, P = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting into K:\n\nK = [ G M_p / ( M_star * (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\nDenominator = M_star * (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\n= M_star^(1) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) a^(3/2) / ( G^(1/2 ) M_star^(1/2) )\n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) a^(3/2) M_star^(1/2) / G^(1/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nK = [ G M_p / ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) a^(3/2) M_star^(1/2) / G^(1/2 ) ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= [ G^(3/2) M_p / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) a^(3/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nHmm, getting a bit messy, but let me try to factor this out.\n\nK = [ ( G^(3/2) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p / ( a^(3/2) M_star^(1/2) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\nG^(3/2) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) = [ G^3 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/2 )\n\nBut perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's consider that the constants can be written as:\n\n[ G^(3/2) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2) ) ] = [ G^3 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/2 )\n\nBut perhaps I should proceed differently.\n\nAnother approach is to express K in terms of a.\n\nFrom the previous step:\n\nK = [ (G M_p ) / ( M_star P ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 / (G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nP = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 / (G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nSubstitute into K:\n\nK = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star * (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= [ ( G M_p ) / ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )^(1/2 ) / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= [ ( G M_p ) * ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )^(1/2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= [ ( G^(3/2) M_p M_star^(1/2) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )^(1/2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nFactor out the exponents:\n\n= [ G^(3/2) M_p M_star^(1/2) / ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= [ G^(3/2) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/2) ) * ( M_p M_star^(1/2) ) / a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= [ ( G^3 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) )^(1/2) ) * ( M_p M_star^(1/2) ) / a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nHmm, perhaps this isn't leading me anywhere useful.\n\nLet me try to write K in terms of a.\n\nAssume that K is proportional to (M_p / a^(something)).\n\nWait, from K's expression, after substituting P from Kepler's law, perhaps K is proportional to (M_p / a^(1/2)).\n\nWait, let me think. Let me try to find the relation between K and a.\n\nWait, let me take the expression:\n\nK = ( (G M_p ) / ( ( M_star )^(1/3) a^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nWhich I think is the correct expression.\n\nSo,\n\nK = ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/9) a^(2/9) )\n\nHmm, so K is proportional to ( M_p / a^(2/3) )^(1/3 ) ) = M_p^(1/3) a^(-2/9 )\n\nSo,\n\nK \u221d M_p^(1/3) a^(-2/9 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nK = k * M_p^(1/3) a^(-2/9 )\n\nWhere k is a constant that depends on G and M_star.\n\nSo for both planets, the same k applies.\n\nThus,\n\nK1/K2 = ( M_p1^(1/3) a1^(-2/9) ) / ( M_p2^(1/3) a2^(-2/9) )\n\n= [ ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) ] * [ ( a2/a1 )^(2/9) ]\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = ( (M_p1/M_p2 )^(1/3) ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(2/9) )\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for (a2/a1):\n\nTake both sides to the power of 9/2:\n\n( K1/K2 )^(9/2 ) = [ (M_p1/M_p2 )^(1/3) ) ]^(9/2) * (a2/a1 )\n\nWhich is,\n\n( K1/K2 )^(9/2 ) = ( M_p1/M_p2 )^(3/2 ) * (a2/a1 )\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = ( K1/K2 )^(9/2 ) / ( M_p1/M_p2 )^(3/2 )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nK1=0.03, K2=0.04 \u2192 K1/K2=0.75.\n\nM_p1=7, M_p2=5 \u2192 M_p1/M_p2=1.4.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = (0.75 )^(9/2 ) / (1.4 )^(3/2 )\n\nCompute each part:\n\n0.75^(4.5) \u2192 Let me compute this.\n\n0.75^4 = (0.75^2)^2 = (0.5625)^2 \u22480.3164.\n\n0.75^0.5 = sqrt(0.75) \u22480.8660.\n\nSo 0.75^4.5 = 0.3164 * 0.8660 \u22480.274.\n\n(1.4 )^(1.5 ) = sqrt(1.4^3 ) = sqrt(2.744 ) \u22481.656.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 \u2248 0.274 / 1.656 \u22480.165.\n\nWhich is about the same as before.

So the ratio is:\n\nT1/T2 = sqrt( ( R_s/(2 a1) ) / ( R_s/(2 a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo back to a2/a1 \u22480.165 \u2192 T1/T2\u22480.406.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have 0.4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the RV calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the correct formula for K.\n\nAnother approach: The RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2 pi) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) ) )\n\nBut again, assuming e=0 and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK = ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_star ) )^(1/3 ) / ( 2 pi )^(1/3 )\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because it doesn't include a.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, another formula I found is:\n\nK = ( ( G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) * (1 + M_p/M_star ) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( ( 1 ) / ( 2 \u03c0 a (1 - e\u00b2) ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's easier to use the ratio of the velocities.\n\nLet me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * a^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, perhaps that's the correct expression.\n\nSo,\n\nK \u221d ( M_p )^(1/3) a^(-2/9 )\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(2/9) )\n\nWe can write:\n\n( K1/K2 ) = ( (7/5 )^(1/3) ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(2/9) )\n\nWe need to find a2/a1.\n\nLet me take the equation:\n\n( K1/K2 ) = ( (7/5 )^(1/3) ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(2/9) )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n( (a2/a1 )^(2/9) ) = ( K1/K2 ) / ( (7/5 )^(1/3) )\n\nRaise both sides to the 9/2 power:\n\na2/a1 = [ ( K1/K2 ) / ( (7/5 )^(1/3) ) ) ]^(9/2 )\n\nCompute each part:\n\nK1/K2 =0.03/0.04=3/4=0.75.\n\n(7/5)^(1/3) \u2248 (1.4)^(0.333) \u22481.119.\n\nSo,\n\n( K1/K2 ) / (7/5 )^(1/3 ) \u22480.75 /1.119 \u22480.670.\n\nNow,\n\n[0.670]^(9/2 )= [0.670]^4.5.\n\nCompute 0.670^4= (0.670^2)^2= (0.4489)^2\u22480.2015.\n\n0.670^0.5\u22480.8185.\n\nSo,\n\n0.670^4.5=0.2015 * 0.8185\u22480.1646.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 \u22480.1646.\n\nWhich brings us back to the same a2/a1 \u22480.1646.\n\nThus, T1/T2 = sqrt(0.1646)= ~0.406.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is T2/T1 instead?

So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating a2/a1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the semi-major axis is proportional to ( ( K * P )^(3/2) ) / ( M_p )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, from the formula K = ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) a^(2/3) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nK^3 = ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) a^(2/3) )\n\nSo,\n\na^(2/3) = ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) K^3 )\n\nRaise both sides to 3/2:\n\na = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) K^3 ) ]^(3/2 )\n\nSo,\n\na \u221d ( M_p )^(3/2 ) / ( K^3 )\n\nWait, so a is proportional to ( M_p )^(3/2 ) / ( K^3 )\n\nSo, a1 \u221d (7)^(3/2 ) / (0.03)^3.\n\na2 \u221d (5)^(3/2 ) / (0.04)^3.\n\nSo,\n\na1/a2 = [ (7^1.5 / 0.03^3 ) ] / [ (5^1.5 /0.04^3 ) ]\n\n= (7^1.5 /5^1.5 ) * (0.04^3 /0.03^3 )\n\n= ( (7/5)^1.5 ) * ( (0.04/0.03)^3 )\n\nCompute each part:\n\n7/5=1.4 \u2192 1.4^1.5 \u22481.4*sqrt(1.4)=1.4*1.1832\u22481.656.\n\n0.04/0.03=4/3\u22481.3333 \u2192 (4/3)^3\u224864/27\u22482.37.\n\nSo,\n\na1/a2 \u22481.656 *2.37\u22483.923.\n\nThus, a1=3.923 a2.\n\nSo a2/a1=1/3.923\u22480.255.\n\nThen, T1/T2= sqrt(0.255)=~0.505.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.5, but the closest option is C) ~0.53.\n\nHmm, but why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps using the correct proportionality.\n\nBecause a is proportional to ( M_p )^(3/2 ) / ( K^3 ), so a1/a2 = ( M_p1^1.5 / M_p2^1.5 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 )\n\nSo,\n\na1/a2 = ( (7/5 )^1.5 ) * ( (0.04/0.03 )^3 )\n\nCompute:\n\n7/5=1.4 \u21921.4^1.5 \u22481.656.\n\n0.04/0.03=4/3 \u2192 (4/3)^3\u224864/27\u22482.37.\n\nSo,\n\na1/a2=1.656 *2.37\u22483.92.\n\nThus, a2/a1=1/3.92\u22480.255.\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2= sqrt(0.255)=~0.505.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.5, but the options have C) ~0.53.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.\n\nWait, let's recalculate:\n\na1 \u221d ( M_p1 )^(3/2 ) / K1^3.\n\nSimilarly, a2 \u221d ( M_p2 )^(3/2 ) / K2^3.\n\nSo,\n\na1/a2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(3/2) ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 ) ]\n\nCompute each part:\n\n(M_p1/M_p2 )^(3/2 )= (7/5 )^1.5= (1.4 )^1.5=1.4 * sqrt(1.4 )\u22481.4*1.1832\u22481.656.\n\nK2/K1=0.04/0.03=4/3\u22481.3333 \u2192 (4/3)^3\u224864/27\u22482.370.\n\nSo,\n\na1/a2=1.656 *2.370\u22483.92.\n\nSo a2/a1=1/3.92\u22480.255.\n\nThus, T1/T2= sqrt(0.255)=~0.505.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.5.

Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)).\n\nSo,\n\nT1 = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2 a1) )\n\nT2 = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2 a2) )\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich, with a2/a1=0.255 \u2192 T1/T2= sqrt(0.255)=~0.505.\n\nBut the options have C) ~0.53. So perhaps I made a mistake in the a2/a1 calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute a2/a1 more accurately.\n\nEarlier, using a1/a2= ( M_p1^1.5 K2^3 ) / ( M_p2^1.5 K1^3 )\n\nWait, no, a1/a2= [ ( M_p1^1.5 ) / ( M_p2^1.5 ) ) ] * [ K2^3 / K1^3 ]\n\nWhich is,\n\n( (7/5 )^1.5 ) * ( (0.04/0.03 )^3 )\n\nCompute:\n\n7/5=1.4 \u2192 1.4^1.5= approx 1.4*1.1832=1.6565.\n\n0.04/0.03=1.3333 \u2192 (1.3333)^3=2.37037.\n\nSo,\n\n1.6565 *2.37037= 1.6565 *2.37037.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n1.6565 *2=3.313.\n\n1.6565 *0.37037\u22481.6565 *0.37\u22480.6129.\n\nSo total\u22483.313+0.6129=3.9259.\n\nThus, a1/a2=3.9259 \u2192 a2/a1=1/3.9259\u22480.2547.\n\nSo T1/T2= sqrt(0.2547)=~0.5047\u22480.505.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have 0.5. Closest is C) 0.53.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the K calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * a^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nBut perhaps I should include the factor of 1/(2 pi )^(1/3 ), which I might have missed earlier.\n\nWait, the correct formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (27 pi G )^(1/3 ) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) (1 - e\u00b2 )^(1/2) ) ) * ( 1 / (P )^(1/3) )\n\nBut when e=0 and sin i=1, and M_p << M_star,\n\nK \u2248 ( (27 pi G )^(1/3 ) ) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P^2=4 pi\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star )\n\nSo P= (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nSubstitute into K:\n\nK \u2248 ( (27 pi G )^(1/3 ) ) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/6 ) ) )\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n= (27 pi G )^(1/3 ) * M_p / M_star^(2/3 ) * ( ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) ) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6 ) a^(1/2 )\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps I can combine the terms.\n\nLet me compute the constants:\n\n(27 pi G )^(1/3 ) = (27)^(1/3 ) * (pi )^(1/3 ) * G^(1/3 ) =3 * pi^(1/3 ) * G^(1/3 )\n\n(4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6 )= (4)^(1/6 ) * (pi )^(1/3 ) = 2^(1/3 ) * pi^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nK \u2248 [3 pi^(1/3 ) G^(1/3 ) ] * [ M_p ] / [ M_star^(2/3 ) ] * [ G^(1/6 ) M_star^(1/6 ) ] / [ 2^(1/3 ) pi^(1/3 ) a^(1/2 ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 3 / 2^(1/3 ) * [ G^(1/3 +1/6 ) ] * [ M_p ] * [ M_star^( -2/3 +1/6 ) ] / a^(1/2 )\n\n= 3 / 2^(1/3 ) * G^(1/2 ) * M_p * M_star^(-1/2 ) / a^(1/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nK = [ 3 G^(1/2 ) / ( 2^(1/3 ) ) ] * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/2 ) a^(1/2 ) )\n\n= [ 3 / 2^(1/3 ) ] * sqrt( G ) * ( M_p ) / ( sqrt( M_star ) * sqrt( a ) )\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nK = [ 3 sqrt( G ) / 2^(1/3 ) ] * ( M_p ) / ( sqrt( M_star a ) )\n\nThus,\n\nK \u221d ( M_p ) / sqrt( M_star a )\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 ) * sqrt( M_star2 / M_star1 )\n\nBut M_star is the same for both planets, so M_star1 = M_star2 =1.5 solar masses.\n\nThus,\n\nK1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( a2 / a1 ) = ( K1/K2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = [ ( K1/K2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) ]^2\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nK1=0.03, K2=0.04 \u2192 K1/K2=0.75.\n\nM_p1=7, M_p2=5 \u2192 M_p2/M_p1=5/7\u22480.7143.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = (0.75 *0.7143 )^2 = (0.5357)^2 \u22480.287.\n\nThus,\n\nT1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(0.287 )\u22480.536.\n\nAh! Now that's about 0.536, which is close to option C) ~0.53.\n\nSo the correct ratio is approximately 0.53.\n\nSo the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:\n\n\\[\nT_p = T_s \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_s}{2a}} \\cdot \\left(1 - A\\right)^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo (\\(A\\)), the \\((1 - A)^{1/4}\\) term cancels out. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude formula.
