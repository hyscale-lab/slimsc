      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe question is about a bound system of two nucleons (like protons or neutrons) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, I think that's the Pauli exclusion principle's effect on the symmetry of the wavefunction.\n\nThe problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to find which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each involving different angular momentum states for X.\n\nWait, I remember that in systems like this, the overall wavefunction must be symmetric or antisymmetric based on the exchange of particles. Since the NN system is a bound state, and assuming they are identical fermions (like two protons or two neutrons), their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The total wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, particle X is emitted. So, the system is the two nucleons (which are identical fermions) and the emitted particle X. Hmm, maybe I should think about the reaction as the initial state (1S0) emitting X to become another state.\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0. So, the initial NN state is 1S0. After emitting X, the NN state becomes something else, and X is emitted.\n\nWait, the problem says that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, the isospin of the two nucleons is 0. Since isospin is a vector, the initial state's isospin must combine with the isospin of X to give the final state's isospin. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nWait, but the question is about the conservation of angular momentum and parity. So, the process must conserve both. Also, the Pauli exclusion principle imposes a condition on the symmetry of the total wavefunction.\n\nThe Pauli condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So, T is the isospin quantum number, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So, this is a relation that must hold for the final state.\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0. So, the initial spin is S=0, because the term is 1S0, which is (2S+1)LJ. Wait, no, wait, the term is given as (2S+1)LJ. So, for 1S0, 2S+1=1 implies S=0. The L is S, but wait, no, the term is 1S0. So, L=0 because S is the orbital angular momentum letter. So, initial state has S=0, L=0, so J=0.\n\nWhen the NN system emits a particle X, the final state of NN must have certain quantum numbers. So, the process is something like NN (initial) \u2192 NN (final) + X.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the reaction. It's a decay process where the initial state is 1S0 (so, NN in a state with S=0, L=0, J=0) and it emits a particle X, becoming another NN state. The final state NN has T=0.\n\nWe need to consider the conservation of angular momentum and parity. Also, the Pauli condition must be satisfied.\n\nWait, the parity of the initial state: the parity of a state is given by (-1)^L. Since the initial state is 1S0, L=0, so parity is 1 (since (-1)^0 =1). The particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So, when X is emitted, the parity of the process would involve the parity of the initial and final states, and the parity of X.\n\nWait, parity conservation would require that the product of the parities of the initial and X equals the parity of the final state. So, parity_initial * parity_X = parity_final.\n\nWait, but parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So, the parity of the initial state (NN) is P_initial. The parity of X is P_X. The parity of the final state (NN) is P_final. The process involves emitting X, so the parity of the final state plus X must have the same parity as the initial state, because parity is conserved in strong interactions (but wait, this emission is via the strong force? Or maybe it's an electromagnetic interaction? Well, the question states to consider conservation of parity, so I guess we can proceed under that assumption.)\n\nSo, initial parity P_initial = 1 (since L=0). X has P_X = -1. The final NN state has parity P_final.\n\nSo, the parity of the final state plus X must equal the initial parity.\n\nWait, the parity of the final state (NN) times the parity of X should equal the initial parity. Because when a particle is emitted, the parity of the system changes by the parity of the emitted particle. So,\n\nP_initial = P_final * P_X\n\nSo, 1 = P_final * (-1) \u2192 P_final = -1.\n\nSo, the final NN state must have parity -1. But wait, parity is (-1)^L, so for the final NN state, L_final must be odd because (-1)^L = -1 \u2192 L_final is odd.\n\nSo, L_final is odd.\n\nNow, looking at the options, each option involves the final NN state and the emitted X.\n\nWait, the options are given as initial state (1S0) \u2192 final state (something) + X.\n\nWait, for each option, the final NN state has some angular momentum state, and X has a certain state.\n\nBut perhaps I should model the problem as: the initial state is NN in 1S0 (J=0), which emits X and becomes a new NN state. So, the angular momentum must be conserved.\n\nWait, angular momentum is conserved, so the initial total angular momentum J_initial (which is 0) must equal the sum of the final NN state's angular momentum J_final and X's angular momentum J_X.\n\nBut wait, angular momentum is a vector, so it's not just the magnitude but also direction. But in this problem, perhaps we're considering the conservation in terms of quantum numbers, assuming that the total angular momentum is conserved as vectors, but perhaps for the sake of this problem, we can consider just the magnitude and ignore the vector aspects, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the problem is about partial waves, which relate to the orbital angular momentum L. So, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system in the initial state is 0 (since L=0 in 1S0), and the orbital angular momentum of the emitted X is l (the lowercase letter in the option), which would be the orbital part of X's state.\n\nWait, but when the NN system emits X, the total orbital angular momentum of the system would change. Hmm, maybe I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the angular momentum coupling. The initial state is J_initial =0. After emission, the final state is a combination of the NN's angular momentum and X's angular momentum.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to look at the parity and the Pauli condition.\n\nWait, the Pauli condition given is T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system.\n\nWait, but the final NN state has T=0. So, substituting into the equation:\n\n0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 -1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2 (since -1 \u22611 mod 2). So, S + L must be odd.\n\nSo, for the final NN state, S + L must be odd.\n\nNow, the final NN state's spin and orbital angular momentum must satisfy this.\n\nBut what about the initial state? The initial state is 1S0, so S_initial=0, L_initial=0.\n\nSo, when X is emitted, the NN system's state changes from S=0, L=0 to S_final, L_final. The spin and orbital angular momentum can change, but how?\n\nWait, the emission of X would involve some interaction that changes the NN's angular momentum. But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the conservation of angular momentum and parity, and the Pauli condition.\n\nSo, let's consider each option and check for each whether it's allowed.\n\nEach option has the initial state 1S0 emitting X and going to a certain final state.\n\nLet me parse each option:\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p. Wait, I think the format is initial state \u2192 final state of NN + X.\n\nWait, the letters after the numbers are the orbital angular momentum. So, 7D1: D is L=2. 7 is the multiplicity, which is 2S+1. So, 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3. So, the final NN state has S=3 and L=2 (since D is 2). The total angular momentum J would be the sum of S and L vectors, but perhaps we're more concerned with their quantum numbers.\n\nWait, but for the Pauli condition, it's S (spin) and L (orbital) of the NN system that matter.\n\nSo, for the final state of the NN in option A: S=3, L=2.\n\nSo, S + L =3+2=5 \u2192 which is odd. So, 5 mod 2 is 1. So, 0=1+1 mod 2? Wait, no, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. T is 0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L must be 1 mod 2. So in option A, S=3, L=2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 5 mod2=1 \u2192 0=1+1 mod2? Wait, no, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod2. So, 0 = (3 + 2) +1 mod2? 3+2=5, +1=6 \u2192 6 mod2=0. So, 0=0, which holds. So, option A is allowed.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact condition. Let me recheck.\n\nThe condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.\n\nSo, T=0 \u2192 0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L = -1 mod2 \u2192 which is same as 1 mod2. So, S + L must be odd.\n\nIn option A, S=3 (which is odd), L=2 (even). 3+2=5 \u2192 odd. So, yes, condition holds.\n\nNow, check parity. The initial state parity is 1 (since L_initial=0). The emitted X has parity -1. The final state's parity is (-1)^L_final. L_final is 2 (D state), so parity is (-1)^2=1.\n\nSo, the parity conservation would require that the initial parity * X's parity = final parity.\n\nSo, initial parity is 1, X's parity is -1.\n\nSo, 1 * (-1) = -1. The final state's parity is 1. So, -1 \u2260 1. Parity is not conserved. So, this process would violate parity conservation. But the question says to use conservation of parity, so this reaction isn't allowed. So, option A would not be allowed because parity isn't conserved.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says to make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So, any option that doesn't conserve parity is invalid.\n\nSo, let's check each option's parity.\n\nFor each option, initial parity P_initial =1 (since initial state is 1S0, L=0). X has P_X=-1. The final NN state's parity is P_final = (-1)^L_final.\n\nSo, conservation of parity requires P_initial = P_final * P_X \u2192 1 = P_final * (-1) \u2192 P_final = -1.\n\nSo, P_final must be -1, which implies L_final is odd.\n\nSo, for each option, check if the final state's L is odd.\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 L=2 (D is 2). 2 is even. So, P_final = (-1)^2=1. Which doesn't match, because we need P_final=-1. So, parity isn't conserved here. So, this option is not allowed.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 L=0 (S is 0). So, P_final =1. Again, 1 * (-1) = -1, which is not equal to initial parity 1. So, this would violate parity.\n\nWait, no: initial parity is 1, X's parity is -1. So, 1 = P_final * (-1) \u2192 P_final = -1.\n\nSo, in option B, the final state's L is 0 \u2192 P_final=1. Which doesn't match, so parity isn't conserved. So, this option is invalid.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 L=2 (D is 2). So, P_final=1. Again, 1\u2260-1. So, parity not conserved. So, invalid.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Wait, the final state's parity is (-1)^L, which for L=2 is 1. So, 1 * (-1) = -1, but initial parity is 1. So, 1 = (-1) * P_final \u2192 P_final = -1. So, in option C, P_final would be 1, which doesn't match. So, parity not conserved. So, option C is invalid.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 L=1 (P is 1). So, P_final = (-1)^1 = -1. Which satisfies the parity condition because 1 = (-1) * (-1) \u2192 1=1.\n\nSo, parity is conserved for option D.\n\nNow, check the Pauli condition for each option.\n\nBut let's remember that the only options that pass parity conservation are D. Because others have L even, leading to P_final=1, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me re-examine each option:\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 L=2 \u2192 P_final=1. So, 1 = 1 * (-1) \u2192 1= -1? No. So parity not conserved.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 L=0 \u2192 P_final=1. So, 1 = 1 * (-1) \u2192 1 = -1? No.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 L=2 \u2192 P_final=1. Same as A and B. So, parity not conserved.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 L=1 \u2192 P_final=-1. So, 1 = (-1) * (-1) \u2192 1=1. So, parity is conserved.\n\nSo, only option D satisfies parity conservation.\n\nWait, but the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So, the other options (A, B, C) have parity not conserved, so they are not allowed.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The initial state is 1S0 (L=0, P=1). X has P=-1. So, the product is 1 * (-1) = -1. So, the final state must have P_final = -1. So, (-1)^L_final = -1 \u2192 L_final must be odd.\n\nSo, in the options, only option D has L=1 (odd). So, others have even L, so their P_final would be 1, which doesn't match. So, only option D is allowed in terms of parity.\n\nBut wait, the question is about which partial wave is NOT permitted. So, the other options (A, B, C) have even L, which would violate parity conservation. So, their processes are not allowed. But the question is about which one is not permitted, so the answer would be one of these.\n\nBut the options are given, and the question is which is not permitted, so the correct answer would be one of A, B, C, D.\n\nWait, but let's look again. The options are:\n\nA) 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p \u2192 L_final=2 \u2192 P_final=1 \u2192 parity not conserved \u2192 invalid.\n\nB) 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p \u2192 L_final=0 \u2192 P_final=1 \u2192 parity not conserved \u2192 invalid.\n\nC) 1S0 \u21923D3 +f \u2192 L_final=2 \u2192 P_final=1 \u2192 parity not conserved \u2192 invalid.\n\nD) 1S0 \u21923P0 +s \u2192 L_final=1 \u2192 P_final=-1 \u2192 parity conserved \u2192 valid.\n\nSo, the only option that satisfies parity conservation is D. So, the other options (A, B, C) would violate parity and thus are not allowed. So, the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So, the answer would be any of A, B, or C.\n\nWait, but the options are given as possible, and the question is which is not permitted. So, the correct answer is either A, B, or C.\n\nWait, but let me check angular momentum conservation for each option.\n\nThe initial state has J_initial=0. The final state's J must be 0, because initial J is 0. But wait, when X is emitted, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So, the sum of the final NN's J and X's J must equal the initial J, which is 0. So, J_NN_final + J_X = 0. But angular momentum is a vector, so the only way this can happen is if J_NN_final = - J_X. But since angular momentum is quantized, the only possibility is that J_NN_final = J_X =0. Because 0 is the only vector that points in the opposite direction with the same magnitude.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the options, the final state has different Js.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial state has J_initial =0. The process is NN (J_initial=0) \u2192 NN (J_final) + X (J_X).\n\nThe total angular momentum after emission must be J_final + J_X = J_initial =0. So, J_final must equal - J_X. But since angular momentum is quantized in integer multiples of \u0127, the only way this can happen is if J_final = J_X =0. Because if J_final is some non-zero value, then J_X must be the negative of that, but they are magnitudes, which can't be negative. So, perhaps this is a misunderstanding on my part.\n\nWait, no, angular momentum is a vector, so J_final and J_X can have opposite directions. So, their vector sum is zero. But when considering the possible quantum numbers, perhaps J_final and J_X must be such that their possible values allow for a combination that sums to zero. But this is more complicated than I thought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN system changes from L_initial=0 to L_final.\n\nIn the initial state, the NN has L=0. After emission, the NN has L_final, and X has l. The total orbital angular momentum after emission would be L_final + l. But since the initial L is 0, the orbital angular momentum must be conserved in the process. So, L_final + l = 0. But this would imply L_final = -l, but since angular momentum is quantized as non-negative integers, the only possibility is L_final = l =0. So, this would mean that X must have l=0, and the NN final state must have L=0. But this can't be right because in the options, X has various l values.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again about the angular momentum. The initial state's orbital angular momentum is 0. The final state's orbital angular momentum is L_final, and the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l. So, the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L_final + l. But since angular momentum is conserved, this must equal the initial L, which is 0. So,\n\nL_final + l = 0 \u2192 L_final = -l. But since L and l are non-negative, the only possibility is L_final = l =0.\n\nBut in the options, X has various l values. For example, option D has X as 's', which is l=0.\n\nSo, in option D, X has l=0, so L_final must be 0. But in option D, the final state is 3P0, which is L=1. So, this would require L_final=1 and l=0, which would make L_final + l =1 \u22600. So, that would violate angular momentum conservation.\n\nWait, this can't be right because that would imply that option D isn't allowed either. But earlier, I thought option D was allowed because parity was conserved.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system and the emitted X must combine to zero. So, the sum of their orbital angular momenta must be zero. So, L_final + l = 0 \u2192 L_final = l. But since L and l are non-negative, the only way is L_final = l =0. So, X must have l=0, and the NN must have L_final=0.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nOption D: X is 's', which is l=0. So, L_final must be 0. But the final state is 3P0, which has L=1 (P is 1). So, L_final=1 and l=0 \u2192 1+0=1\u22600. So, angular momentum isn't conserved. So, this would mean option D isn't allowed either.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought option D was allowed because parity was conserved. Now, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me try another way.\n\nIn the initial state, the orbital angular momentum is L_initial =0.\n\nAfter emission, the NN has L_final, and the X has l. The total orbital angular momentum is L_final + l.\n\nBut since the initial L is 0, L_final + l must be 0. So, L_final = l.\n\nBut L_final can't be negative, so L_final = l.\n\nSo, in the options, X's l must equal the final L of the NN.\n\nLet me check each option.\n\nOption A: X is p \u2192 l=1. So, L_final must be 1. But the final state is 7D1 \u2192 L=2. So, 2\u22601 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption B: X is p \u2192 l=1. Final state is 3S1 \u2192 L=0. 0\u22601 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C: X is f \u2192 l=3. Final state is 3D3 \u2192 L=2. 2\u22603 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: X is s \u2192 l=0. Final state is 3P0 \u2192 L=1. 1\u22600 \u2192 invalid.\n\nWait, this suggests that none of the options satisfy L_final = l. So, all options are invalid in terms of angular momentum conservation.\n\nBut this can't be correct because the question states that one of them is not permitted, implying that others are allowed.\n\nI must be making a mistake here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum isn't the only part of the angular momentum. The total angular momentum includes spin as well. So, maybe the initial state's total angular momentum is 0, and the final state's total angular momentum plus X's must add up to 0.\n\nBut that's more complicated. Let me consider that the initial state has J=0 (from 1S0: S=0, L=0 \u2192 J=0).\n\nThe final state's total angular momentum is J_NN, and X's is J_X. So, J_NN + J_X must equal 0. But since J is a vector, the only way this can happen is if J_NN = - J_X. But since J is non-negative, this can only happen if both J_NN and J_X are zero.\n\nSo, the final state must have J_NN=0, and X must have J_X=0.\n\nSo, for each option, check if the final NN state has J=0 and X has J=0.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nOption A: Final state is 7D1 \u2192 S=3, L=2. So, possible J values would be 3+2=5 down to |3-2|=1. So, possible Js are 1,2,3,4,5. So, J=1 is possible, but J=0 is not. So, the final state can't have J=0. Thus, option A is invalid.\n\nOption B: Final state is 3S1 \u2192 S=1, L=0. So, J can be 1 (since L=0, so J=S=1). So, J=1. X is p, which is a spin-0 particle (since p is a pseudoscalar meson, I think). So, J_X=0. So, J_NN=1, J_X=0 \u2192 sum is 1, not 0. So, angular momentum isn't conserved. So, option B is invalid.\n\nOption C: Final state is 3D3 \u2192 S=1, L=2. So, possible J values are 3,2,1. So, J=3,2,1. X is f, which is a vector meson (spin 1). So, J_X=1. So, J_NN could be 2 (if J_NN=2 and J_X=1, but 2+1=3, which isn't 0. Alternatively, maybe J_NN=1 and J_X=1 \u2192 sum would be 0 in some vector combination, but that's complicated. But for scalar conservation, J_total must be 0, so J_NN and J_X must cancel each other vectorially. But in terms of quantum numbers, perhaps the only way is if J_NN=0 and J_X=0, which isn't the case here. So, option C is invalid.\n\nOption D: Final state is 3P0 \u2192 S=0, L=1. So, J=1 (since L=1 and S=0 \u2192 J=1). X is s, which is a scalar (spin 0). So, J_X=0. So, J_NN=1 and J_X=0 \u2192 sum is 1, not 0. So, angular momentum isn't conserved. Thus, option D is invalid.\n\nWait, this suggests that none of the options satisfy J conservation. But that can't be right because the question is asking which is not permitted, implying that the others are allowed.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me try to think again.\n\nPerhaps I should approach this by considering the initial state and the possible transitions.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nAfter emitting X, the final NN state has T=0.\n\nThe Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nSo, for the final state, T=0 \u2192 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L =1 mod2.\n\nSo, S + L must be odd.\n\nAdditionally, parity must be conserved: P_initial = P_final * P_X.\n\nP_initial =1 (since L=0).\n\nP_X is -1.\n\nSo, 1 = P_final * (-1) \u2192 P_final = -1.\n\nP_final is (-1)^L \u2192 so L must be odd.\n\nSo, L must be odd. So, L_final can be 1,3,5 etc.\n\nNow, looking at each option:\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 L=2 (even). So, L is even \u2192 violates the parity condition. So, option A is invalid.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 L=0 \u2192 even \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 L=2 \u2192 even \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 L=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 parity condition satisfied.\n\nSo, only option D satisfies the parity condition.\n\nNow, check the Pauli condition.\n\nFor option D: L=1, S=0 (since 3P0 \u2192 S=0).\n\nSo, S + L =0 +1=1 \u2192 which is odd \u2192 1 mod2=1. So, T=0 =1 +1 mod2? Wait, the condition is T= S + L +1 mod2.\n\nSo, 0 = (0 +1) +1 mod2 \u2192 0= (2) mod2 \u2192 0=0. So, condition holds.\n\nNow, check angular momentum conservation.\n\nThe initial state has J=0.\n\nThe final state's J is determined by S and L.\n\nIn option D: S=0, L=1 \u2192 J can be 1.\n\nX's angular momentum: X is 's' \u2192 which is a scalar, so spin 0 \u2192 J_X=0.\n\nSo, J_NN_final=1, J_X=0 \u2192 total J=1 \u2192 doesn't match initial J=0.\n\nSo, angular momentum isn't conserved. Thus, option D is invalid.\n\nWait, but the problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So, option D passes parity but fails angular momentum.\n\nSo, which option passes both?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial state has J=0. The final state's J (NN) plus X's J must sum to J=0.\n\nSo, J_NN_final + J_X =0 \u2192 J_NN_final = -J_X.\n\nBut since angular momentum is quantized, the only way this can happen is if J_NN_final = J_X =0.\n\nSo, both J_NN_final and J_X must be zero.\n\nIn that case, the final state's NN must have J=0, and X must have J=0.\n\nLooking at each option:\n\nOption D: Final state J=1 (since S=0, L=1 \u2192 J=1), X J=0 \u2192 sum is 1 \u2192 not zero \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo, none of the options have J_NN_final=0 and J_X=0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process involves more than just orbital angular momentum. Maybe the total angular momentum includes spin and orbital parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the process with the initial state's angular momentum being 0, and the final state's angular momentum plus X's must sum to 0.\n\nSo, J_NN_final + J_X =0 \u2192 J_NN_final = - J_X.\n\nIn terms of quantum numbers, this is only possible if J_NN_final = J_X =0.\n\nSo, both must have J=0.\n\nSo, let's check each option again.\n\nOption A: Final state is 7D1 \u2192 S=3, L=2 \u2192 possible J=1,2,3,4,5. So, J can't be 0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption B: Final state is 3S1 \u2192 S=1, L=0 \u2192 J=1. X is p (J=0). So, J_NN=1, J_X=0 \u2192 sum=1\u22600 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C: Final state is 3D3 \u2192 S=1, L=2 \u2192 possible J=1,2,3. So, J can't be 0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: Final state is 3P0 \u2192 S=0, L=1 \u2192 J=1. X is s (J=0). So, sum J=1\u22600 \u2192 invalid.\n\nHmm, this suggests that none of the options satisfy angular momentum conservation, which can't be right.\n\nBut the problem states that the final NN state has T=0, and we're to find which partial wave is not allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something about the isospin part.\n\nThe Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod2.\n\nSo, in option D, T=0, S=0, L=1 \u2192 0=0+1+1 mod2 \u2192 0=2 mod2 \u2192 0=0 \u2192 condition holds.\n\nBut angular momentum isn't conserved, so option D is invalid.\n\nBut the problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So, the only option that satisfies parity is D, but it doesn't satisfy angular momentum.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is option D is not permitted because angular momentum isn't conserved, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the angular momentum coupling.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is not about the sum of the angular momenta, but about the conservation in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the NN's orbital angular momentum changes from 0 to L.\n\nSo, the initial orbital angular momentum is 0. After emission, the NN has L, and X has l. So, 0 = L - l \u2192 L = l.\n\nBecause the orbital angular momentum is a vector, the sum of the NN's L and X's l must equal the initial 0. So, L + l =0 \u2192 L = -l \u2192 but since L and l are non-negative, this implies L=l=0.\n\nSo, X must have l=0, and the NN must have L=0.\n\nSo, looking at the options, which have X with l=0 and NN's L=0.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: X is 's' \u2192 l=0. NN's L=1 \u2192 so L\u22600 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo, none of the options have X with l=0 and NN's L=0. Thus, all options are invalid, which can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize.\n\nThe initial state has L=0, so after emission, the NN's L must be equal to the X's l (since L_initial=0 \u2192 L_final + l =0 \u2192 L_final = -l \u2192 but since they're non-negative, L_final = l =0).\n\nSo, X must have l=0, and NN must have L=0.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nWhich options have X with l=0?\n\nOption D: X is 's' \u2192 l=0.\n\nSo, option D is the only one where X has l=0.\n\nBut in option D, the final NN has L=1 \u2192 which doesn't match. So, it's invalid.\n\nSo, none of the options satisfy both parity and angular momentum conservation.\n\nBut the problem states that the final NN state has T=0, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is not just about orbital angular momentum but also spin.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum isn't conserved because the process involves a transition where the angular momentum is carried away by X, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only about parity and the Pauli condition, and angular momentum is not to be considered beyond that.\n\nBut the question says to make use of both conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the orbital angular momentum of X, not its spin.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nThe question is which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D.\n\nFrom the parity condition, only option D has the correct parity (L=1, P=-1). So, it's the only one that satisfies parity conservation.\n\nBut angular momentum isn't conserved in option D because J_NN_final=1 and J_X=0 \u2192 sum is 1\u22600.\n\nSo, option D is invalid.\n\nBut the other options have parity not conserved, so they're invalid as well.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So, perhaps the answer is that option D is not permitted because angular momentum isn't conserved, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is only about the Pauli condition and parity, and angular momentum isn't considered beyond that.\n\nBut the question explicitly says to consider both conservation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the Pauli condition. The condition given is T = S + L +1 mod2.\n\nWait, perhaps T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system.\n\nIn option D: T=0, S=0, L=1 \u2192 0 =0+1 +1 mod2 \u2192 0=2 mod2 \u2192 0=0 \u2192 condition holds.\n\nSo, Pauli condition is satisfied.\n\nParity is also conserved in option D.\n\nBut angular momentum isn't conserved because J_initial=0, J_final=1, J_X=0 \u2192 sum is 1\u22600.\n\nSo, option D is invalid.\n\nBut the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So, the answer is option D because it doesn't conserve angular momentum.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option D was the only one that satisfied parity conservation. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D is not allowed because angular momentum isn't conserved.\n\nBut the problem says to make use of both conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is option D is not permitted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the angular momentum part.\n\nWait, perhaps the total angular momentum isn't necessarily 0 after emission. Because the process is an emission, which is a transition, perhaps the initial state has J=0, and the final state's J plus X's J must equal 0. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem isn't requiring the sum of J to be zero but is more about the possible transitions based on angular momentum coupling.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option D is allowed because it satisfies parity and Pauli condition, but angular momentum isn't considered in this problem. But I'm not certain.\n\nWait, the problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So, the correct answer must satisfy both.\n\nSo, option D satisfies parity but not angular momentum. So, it's invalid.\n\nBut the other options don't satisfy parity, so they're invalid as well.\n\nThis suggests that all options are invalid, which can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the initial state's J. The initial state is 1S0 \u2192 J=0.\n\nThe final state's J (NN) plus X's J must equal 0.\n\nSo, J_NN_final + J_X =0 \u2192 J_NN_final = - J_X.\n\nSince J is a non-negative integer, the only possibility is J_NN_final= J_X=0.\n\nSo, both must have J=0.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nWhich options have J_NN_final=0 and J_X=0?\n\nOption D: J_NN_final=1 (since S=0, L=1 \u2192 J=1), J_X=0 \u2192 sum=1\u2192 invalid.\n\nNo options have both J_NN_final=0 and J_X=0.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is that none of the options are allowed, but that's not one of the choices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the way the angular momentum is handled.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is an s-wave emission, where l=0. So, X has l=0, and the NN's L changes from 0 to 0 (since L_initial=0). So, L_final=0, l=0 \u2192 L_final + l=0.\n\nIn that case, for parity, P_final = (-1)^0=1. So, 1 * (-1) =-1 \u2192 P_initial=1. So, 1 = (-1) * P_final \u2192 P_final =-1. Which would require L_final=1, which contradicts L_final=0.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the earlier analysis.\n\nOnly option D satisfies parity conservation. But it fails angular momentum conservation. So, it's invalid. Thus, the correct answer is that option D is not permitted because it doesn't conserve angular momentum.\n\nWait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So, the answer is option D is not permitted.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) initially in the 1S0 state, which emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1.

This means the total angular momentum of the final NN state (\\( J_{\\text{final}} \\)) and the emitted particle \\( X \\) (\\( J_X \\)) must satisfy \\( J_{\\text{final}} + J_X = 0 \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe question is about a bound system of two nucleons (like protons or neutrons) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, I think that's the Pauli exclusion principle's effect on the symmetry of the wavefunction.\n\nThe problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to find which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each involving different angular momentum states for X.\n\nWait, I remember that in systems like this, the overall wavefunction must be symmetric or antisymmetric based on the exchange of particles. Since the NN system is a bound state, and assuming they are identical fermions (like two protons or two neutrons), their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The total wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, particle X is emitted. So, the system is the two nucleons (which are identical fermions) and the emitted particle X. Hmm, maybe I should think about the reaction as the initial state (1S0) emitting X to become another state.\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0. So, the initial NN state is 1S0. After emitting X, the NN state becomes something else, and X is emitted.\n\nWait, the problem says that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, the isospin of the two nucleons is 0. Since isospin is a vector, the initial state's isospin must combine with the isospin of X to give the final state's isospin. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nWait, but the question is about the conservation of angular momentum and parity. So, the process must conserve both. Also, the Pauli exclusion principle imposes a condition on the symmetry of the total wavefunction.\n\nThe Pauli condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So, T is the isospin quantum number, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So, this is a relation that must hold for the final state.\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0. So, the initial spin is S=0, because the term is 1S0, which is (2S+1)LJ. Wait, no, wait, the term is given as (2S+1)LJ. So, for 1S0, 2S+1=1 implies S=0. The L is S, but wait, no, the term is 1S0. So, L=0 because S is the orbital angular momentum letter. So, initial state has S=0, L=0, so J=0.\n\nWhen the NN system emits a particle X, the final state of NN must have certain quantum numbers. So, the process is something like NN (initial) \u2192 NN (final) + X.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the reaction. It's a decay process where the initial state is 1S0 (so, NN in a state with S=0, L=0, J=0) and it emits a particle X, becoming another NN state. The final state NN has T=0.\n\nWe need to consider the conservation of angular momentum and parity. Also, the Pauli condition must be satisfied.\n\nWait, the parity of the initial state: the parity of a state is given by (-1)^L. Since the initial state is 1S0, L=0, so parity is 1 (since (-1)^0 =1). The particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So, when X is emitted, the parity of the process would involve the parity of the initial and final states, and the parity of X.\n\nWait, parity conservation would require that the product of the parities of the initial and X equals the parity of the final state. So, parity_initial * parity_X = parity_final.\n\nWait, but parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So, the parity of the initial state (NN) is P_initial. The parity of X is P_X. The parity of the final state (NN) is P_final. The process involves emitting X, so the parity of the final state plus X must have the same parity as the initial state, because parity is conserved in strong interactions (but wait, this emission is via the strong force? Or maybe it's an electromagnetic interaction? Well, the question states to consider conservation of parity, so I guess we can proceed under that assumption.)\n\nSo, initial parity P_initial = 1 (since L=0). X has P_X = -1. The final NN state has parity P_final.\n\nSo, the parity of the final state plus X must equal the initial parity.\n\nWait, the parity of the final state (NN) times the parity of X should equal the initial parity. Because when a particle is emitted, the parity of the system changes by the parity of the emitted particle. So,\n\nP_initial = P_final * P_X\n\nSo, 1 = P_final * (-1) \u2192 P_final = -1.\n\nSo, the final NN state must have parity -1. But wait, parity is (-1)^L, so for the final NN state, L_final must be odd because (-1)^L = -1 \u2192 L_final is odd.\n\nSo, L_final is odd.\n\nNow, looking at the options, each option involves the final NN state and the emitted X.\n\nWait, the options are given as initial state (1S0) \u2192 final state (something) + X.\n\nWait, for each option, the final NN state has some angular momentum state, and X has a certain state.\n\nBut perhaps I should model the problem as: the initial state is NN in 1S0 (J=0), which emits X and becomes a new NN state. So, the angular momentum must be conserved.\n\nWait, angular momentum is conserved, so the initial total angular momentum J_initial (which is 0) must equal the sum of the final NN state's angular momentum J_final and X's angular momentum J_X.\n\nBut wait, angular momentum is a vector, so it's not just the magnitude but also direction. But in this problem, perhaps we're considering the conservation in terms of quantum numbers, assuming that the total angular momentum is conserved as vectors, but perhaps for the sake of this problem, we can consider just the magnitude and ignore the vector aspects, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the problem is about partial waves, which relate to the orbital angular momentum L. So, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system in the initial state is 0 (since L=0 in 1S0), and the orbital angular momentum of the emitted X is l (the lowercase letter in the option), which would be the orbital part of X's state.\n\nWait, but when the NN system emits X, the total orbital angular momentum of the system would change. Hmm, maybe I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the angular momentum coupling. The initial state is J_initial =0. After emission, the final state is a combination of the NN's angular momentum and X's angular momentum.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to look at the parity and the Pauli condition.\n\nWait, the Pauli condition given is T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system.\n\nWait, but the final NN state has T=0. So, substituting into the equation:\n\n0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 -1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2 (since -1 \u22611 mod 2). So, S + L must be odd.\n\nSo, for the final NN state, S + L must be odd.\n\nNow, the final NN state's spin and orbital angular momentum must satisfy this.\n\nBut what about the initial state? The initial state is 1S0, so S_initial=0, L_initial=0.\n\nSo, when X is emitted, the NN system's state changes from S=0, L=0 to S_final, L_final. The spin and orbital angular momentum can change, but how?\n\nWait, the emission of X would involve some interaction that changes the NN's angular momentum. But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the conservation of angular momentum and parity, and the Pauli condition.\n\nSo, let's consider each option and check for each whether it's allowed.\n\nEach option has the initial state 1S0 emitting X and going to a certain final state.\n\nLet me parse each option:\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p. Wait, I think the format is initial state \u2192 final state of NN + X.\n\nWait, the letters after the numbers are the orbital angular momentum. So, 7D1: D is L=2. 7 is the multiplicity, which is 2S+1. So, 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3. So, the final NN state has S=3 and L=2 (since D is 2). The total angular momentum J would be the sum of S and L vectors, but perhaps we're more concerned with their quantum numbers.\n\nWait, but for the Pauli condition, it's S (spin) and L (orbital) of the NN system that matter.\n\nSo, for the final state of the NN in option A: S=3, L=2.\n\nSo, S + L =3+2=5 \u2192 which is odd. So, 5 mod 2 is 1. So, 0=1+1 mod 2? Wait, no, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. T is 0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L must be 1 mod 2. So in option A, S=3, L=2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 5 mod2=1 \u2192 0=1+1 mod2? Wait, no, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod2. So, 0 = (3 + 2) +1 mod2? 3+2=5, +1=6 \u2192 6 mod2=0. So, 0=0, which holds. So, option A is allowed.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact condition. Let me recheck.\n\nThe condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.\n\nSo, T=0 \u2192 0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L = -1 mod2 \u2192 which is same as 1 mod2. So, S + L must be odd.\n\nIn option A, S=3 (which is odd), L=2 (even). 3+2=5 \u2192 odd. So, yes, condition holds.\n\nNow, check parity. The initial state parity is 1 (since L_initial=0). The emitted X has parity -1. The final state's parity is (-1)^L_final. L_final is 2 (D state), so parity is (-1)^2=1.\n\nSo, the parity conservation would require that the initial parity * X's parity = final parity.\n\nSo, initial parity is 1, X's parity is -1.\n\nSo, 1 * (-1) = -1. The final state's parity is 1. So, -1 \u2260 1. Parity is not conserved. So, this process would violate parity conservation. But the question says to use conservation of parity, so this reaction isn't allowed. So, option A would not be allowed because parity isn't conserved.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says to make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So, any option that doesn't conserve parity is invalid.\n\nSo, let's check each option's parity.\n\nFor each option, initial parity P_initial =1 (since initial state is 1S0, L=0). X has P_X=-1. The final NN state's parity is P_final = (-1)^L_final.\n\nSo, conservation of parity requires P_initial = P_final * P_X \u2192 1 = P_final * (-1) \u2192 P_final = -1.\n\nSo, P_final must be -1, which implies L_final is odd.\n\nSo, for each option, check if the final state's L is odd.\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 L=2 (D is 2). 2 is even. So, P_final = (-1)^2=1. Which doesn't match, because we need P_final=-1. So, parity isn't conserved here. So, this option is not allowed.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 L=0 (S is 0). So, P_final =1. Again, 1 * (-1) = -1, which is not equal to initial parity 1. So, this would violate parity.\n\nWait, no: initial parity is 1, X's parity is -1. So, 1 = P_final * (-1) \u2192 P_final = -1.\n\nSo, in option B, the final state's L is 0 \u2192 P_final=1. Which doesn't match, so parity isn't conserved. So, this option is invalid.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 L=2 (D is 2). So, P_final=1. Again, 1\u2260-1. So, parity not conserved. So, invalid.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Wait, the final state's parity is (-1)^L, which for L=2 is 1. So, 1 * (-1) = -1, but initial parity is 1. So, 1 = (-1) * P_final \u2192 P_final = -1. So, in option C, P_final would be 1, which doesn't match. So, parity not conserved. So, option C is invalid.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 L=1 (P is 1). So, P_final = (-1)^1 = -1. Which satisfies the parity condition because 1 = (-1) * (-1) \u2192 1=1.\n\nSo, parity is conserved for option D.\n\nNow, check the Pauli condition for each option.\n\nBut let's remember that the only options that pass parity conservation are D. Because others have L even, leading to P_final=1, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me re-examine each option:\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 L=2 \u2192 P_final=1. So, 1 = 1 * (-1) \u2192 1= -1? No. So parity not conserved.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 L=0 \u2192 P_final=1. So, 1 = 1 * (-1) \u2192 1 = -1? No.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 L=2 \u2192 P_final=1. Same as A and B. So, parity not conserved.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 L=1 \u2192 P_final=-1. So, 1 = (-1) * (-1) \u2192 1=1. So, parity is conserved.\n\nSo, only option D satisfies parity conservation.\n\nWait, but the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So, the other options (A, B, C) have parity not conserved, so they are not allowed.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The initial state is 1S0 (L=0, P=1). X has P=-1. So, the product is 1 * (-1) = -1. So, the final state must have P_final = -1. So, (-1)^L_final = -1 \u2192 L_final must be odd.\n\nSo, in the options, only option D has L=1 (odd). So, others have even L, so their P_final would be 1, which doesn't match. So, only option D is allowed in terms of parity.\n\nBut wait, the question is about which partial wave is NOT permitted. So, the other options (A, B, C) have even L, which would violate parity conservation. So, their processes are not allowed. But the question is about which one is not permitted, so the answer would be one of these.\n\nBut the options are given, and the question is which is not permitted, so the correct answer would be one of A, B, C, D.\n\nWait, but let's look again. The options are:\n\nA) 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p \u2192 L_final=2 \u2192 P_final=1 \u2192 parity not conserved \u2192 invalid.\n\nB) 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p \u2192 L_final=0 \u2192 P_final=1 \u2192 parity not conserved \u2192 invalid.\n\nC) 1S0 \u21923D3 +f \u2192 L_final=2 \u2192 P_final=1 \u2192 parity not conserved \u2192 invalid.\n\nD) 1S0 \u21923P0 +s \u2192 L_final=1 \u2192 P_final=-1 \u2192 parity conserved \u2192 valid.\n\nSo, the only option that satisfies parity conservation is D. So, the other options (A, B, C) would violate parity and thus are not allowed. So, the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So, the answer would be any of A, B, or C.\n\nWait, but the options are given as possible, and the question is which is not permitted. So, the correct answer is either A, B, or C.\n\nWait, but let me check angular momentum conservation for each option.\n\nThe initial state has J_initial=0. The final state's J must be 0, because initial J is 0. But wait, when X is emitted, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So, the sum of the final NN's J and X's J must equal the initial J, which is 0. So, J_NN_final + J_X = 0. But angular momentum is a vector, so the only way this can happen is if J_NN_final = - J_X. But since angular momentum is quantized, the only possibility is that J_NN_final = J_X =0. Because 0 is the only vector that points in the opposite direction with the same magnitude.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the options, the final state has different Js.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial state has J_initial =0. The process is NN (J_initial=0) \u2192 NN (J_final) + X (J_X).\n\nThe total angular momentum after emission must be J_final + J_X = J_initial =0. So, J_final must equal - J_X. But since angular momentum is quantized in integer multiples of \u0127, the only way this can happen is if J_final = J_X =0. Because if J_final is some non-zero value, then J_X must be the negative of that, but they are magnitudes, which can't be negative. So, perhaps this is a misunderstanding on my part.\n\nWait, no, angular momentum is a vector, so J_final and J_X can have opposite directions. So, their vector sum is zero. But when considering the possible quantum numbers, perhaps J_final and J_X must be such that their possible values allow for a combination that sums to zero. But this is more complicated than I thought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN system changes from L_initial=0 to L_final.\n\nIn the initial state, the NN has L=0. After emission, the NN has L_final, and X has l. The total orbital angular momentum after emission would be L_final + l. But since the initial L is 0, the orbital angular momentum must be conserved in the process. So, L_final + l = 0. But this would imply L_final = -l, but since angular momentum is quantized as non-negative integers, the only possibility is L_final = l =0. So, this would mean that X must have l=0, and the NN final state must have L=0. But this can't be right because in the options, X has various l values.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again about the angular momentum. The initial state's orbital angular momentum is 0. The final state's orbital angular momentum is L_final, and the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l. So, the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L_final + l. But since angular momentum is conserved, this must equal the initial L, which is 0. So,\n\nL_final + l = 0 \u2192 L_final = -l. But since L and l are non-negative, the only possibility is L_final = l =0.\n\nBut in the options, X has various l values. For example, option D has X as 's', which is l=0.\n\nSo, in option D, X has l=0, so L_final must be 0. But in option D, the final state is 3P0, which is L=1. So, this would require L_final=1 and l=0, which would make L_final + l =1 \u22600. So, that would violate angular momentum conservation.\n\nWait, this can't be right because that would imply that option D isn't allowed either. But earlier, I thought option D was allowed because parity was conserved.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system and the emitted X must combine to zero. So, the sum of their orbital angular momenta must be zero. So, L_final + l = 0 \u2192 L_final = l. But since L and l are non-negative, the only way is L_final = l =0. So, X must have l=0, and the NN must have L_final=0.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nOption D: X is 's', which is l=0. So, L_final must be 0. But the final state is 3P0, which has L=1 (P is 1). So, L_final=1 and l=0 \u2192 1+0=1\u22600. So, angular momentum isn't conserved. So, this would mean option D isn't allowed either.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought option D was allowed because parity was conserved. Now, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me try another way.\n\nIn the initial state, the orbital angular momentum is L_initial =0.\n\nAfter emission, the NN has L_final, and the X has l. The total orbital angular momentum is L_final + l.\n\nBut since the initial L is 0, L_final + l must be 0. So, L_final = l.\n\nBut L_final can't be negative, so L_final = l.\n\nSo, in the options, X's l must equal the final L of the NN.\n\nLet me check each option.\n\nOption A: X is p \u2192 l=1. So, L_final must be 1. But the final state is 7D1 \u2192 L=2. So, 2\u22601 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption B: X is p \u2192 l=1. Final state is 3S1 \u2192 L=0. 0\u22601 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C: X is f \u2192 l=3. Final state is 3D3 \u2192 L=2. 2\u22603 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: X is s \u2192 l=0. Final state is 3P0 \u2192 L=1. 1\u22600 \u2192 invalid.\n\nWait, this suggests that none of the options satisfy L_final = l. So, all options are invalid in terms of angular momentum conservation.\n\nBut this can't be correct because the question states that one of them is not permitted, implying that others are allowed.\n\nI must be making a mistake here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum isn't the only part of the angular momentum. The total angular momentum includes spin as well. So, maybe the initial state's total angular momentum is 0, and the final state's total angular momentum plus X's must add up to 0.\n\nBut that's more complicated. Let me consider that the initial state has J=0 (from 1S0: S=0, L=0 \u2192 J=0).\n\nThe final state's total angular momentum is J_NN, and X's is J_X. So, J_NN + J_X must equal 0. But since J is a vector, the only way this can happen is if J_NN = - J_X. But since J is non-negative, this can only happen if both J_NN and J_X are zero.\n\nSo, the final state must have J_NN=0, and X must have J_X=0.\n\nSo, for each option, check if the final NN state has J=0 and X has J=0.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nOption A: Final state is 7D1 \u2192 S=3, L=2. So, possible J values would be 3+2=5 down to |3-2|=1. So, possible Js are 1,2,3,4,5. So, J=1 is possible, but J=0 is not. So, the final state can't have J=0. Thus, option A is invalid.\n\nOption B: Final state is 3S1 \u2192 S=1, L=0. So, J can be 1 (since L=0, so J=S=1). So, J=1. X is p, which is a spin-0 particle (since p is a pseudoscalar meson, I think). So, J_X=0. So, J_NN=1, J_X=0 \u2192 sum is 1, not 0. So, angular momentum isn't conserved. So, option B is invalid.\n\nOption C: Final state is 3D3 \u2192 S=1, L=2. So, possible J values are 3,2,1. So, J=3,2,1. X is f, which is a vector meson (spin 1). So, J_X=1. So, J_NN could be 2 (if J_NN=2 and J_X=1, but 2+1=3, which isn't 0. Alternatively, maybe J_NN=1 and J_X=1 \u2192 sum would be 0 in some vector combination, but that's complicated. But for scalar conservation, J_total must be 0, so J_NN and J_X must cancel each other vectorially. But in terms of quantum numbers, perhaps the only way is if J_NN=0 and J_X=0, which isn't the case here. So, option C is invalid.\n\nOption D: Final state is 3P0 \u2192 S=0, L=1. So, J=1 (since L=1 and S=0 \u2192 J=1). X is s, which is a scalar (spin 0). So, J_X=0. So, J_NN=1 and J_X=0 \u2192 sum is 1, not 0. So, angular momentum isn't conserved. Thus, option D is invalid.\n\nWait, this suggests that none of the options satisfy J conservation. But that can't be right because the question is asking which is not permitted, implying that the others are allowed.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me try to think again.\n\nPerhaps I should approach this by considering the initial state and the possible transitions.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nAfter emitting X, the final NN state has T=0.\n\nThe Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nSo, for the final state, T=0 \u2192 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L =1 mod2.\n\nSo, S + L must be odd.\n\nAdditionally, parity must be conserved: P_initial = P_final * P_X.\n\nP_initial =1 (since L=0).\n\nP_X is -1.\n\nSo, 1 = P_final * (-1) \u2192 P_final = -1.\n\nP_final is (-1)^L \u2192 so L must be odd.\n\nSo, L must be odd. So, L_final can be 1,3,5 etc.\n\nNow, looking at each option:\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 L=2 (even). So, L is even \u2192 violates the parity condition. So, option A is invalid.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 L=0 \u2192 even \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 L=2 \u2192 even \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 L=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 parity condition satisfied.\n\nSo, only option D satisfies the parity condition.\n\nNow, check the Pauli condition.\n\nFor option D: L=1, S=0 (since 3P0 \u2192 S=0).\n\nSo, S + L =0 +1=1 \u2192 which is odd \u2192 1 mod2=1. So, T=0 =1 +1 mod2? Wait, the condition is T= S + L +1 mod2.\n\nSo, 0 = (0 +1) +1 mod2 \u2192 0= (2) mod2 \u2192 0=0. So, condition holds.\n\nNow, check angular momentum conservation.\n\nThe initial state has J=0.\n\nThe final state's J is determined by S and L.\n\nIn option D: S=0, L=1 \u2192 J can be 1.\n\nX's angular momentum: X is 's' \u2192 which is a scalar, so spin 0 \u2192 J_X=0.\n\nSo, J_NN_final=1, J_X=0 \u2192 total J=1 \u2192 doesn't match initial J=0.\n\nSo, angular momentum isn't conserved. Thus, option D is invalid.\n\nWait, but the problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So, option D passes parity but fails angular momentum.\n\nSo, which option passes both?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial state has J=0. The final state's J (NN) plus X's J must sum to J=0.\n\nSo, J_NN_final + J_X =0 \u2192 J_NN_final = -J_X.\n\nBut since angular momentum is quantized, the only way this can happen is if J_NN_final = J_X =0.\n\nSo, both J_NN_final and J_X must be zero.\n\nIn that case, the final state's NN must have J=0, and X must have J=0.\n\nLooking at each option:\n\nOption D: Final state J=1 (since S=0, L=1 \u2192 J=1), X J=0 \u2192 sum is 1 \u2192 not zero \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo, none of the options have J_NN_final=0 and J_X=0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process involves more than just orbital angular momentum. Maybe the total angular momentum includes spin and orbital parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the process with the initial state's angular momentum being 0, and the final state's angular momentum plus X's must sum to 0.\n\nSo, J_NN_final + J_X =0 \u2192 J_NN_final = - J_X.\n\nIn terms of quantum numbers, this is only possible if J_NN_final = J_X =0.\n\nSo, both must have J=0.\n\nSo, let's check each option again.\n\nOption A: Final state is 7D1 \u2192 S=3, L=2 \u2192 possible J=1,2,3,4,5. So, J can't be 0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption B: Final state is 3S1 \u2192 S=1, L=0 \u2192 J=1. X is p (J=0). So, J_NN=1, J_X=0 \u2192 sum=1\u22600 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C: Final state is 3D3 \u2192 S=1, L=2 \u2192 possible J=1,2,3. So, J can't be 0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: Final state is 3P0 \u2192 S=0, L=1 \u2192 J=1. X is s (J=0). So, sum J=1\u22600 \u2192 invalid.\n\nHmm, this suggests that none of the options satisfy angular momentum conservation, which can't be right.\n\nBut the problem states that the final NN state has T=0, and we're to find which partial wave is not allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something about the isospin part.\n\nThe Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod2.\n\nSo, in option D, T=0, S=0, L=1 \u2192 0=0+1+1 mod2 \u2192 0=2 mod2 \u2192 0=0 \u2192 condition holds.\n\nBut angular momentum isn't conserved, so option D is invalid.\n\nBut the problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So, the only option that satisfies parity is D, but it doesn't satisfy angular momentum.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is option D is not permitted because angular momentum isn't conserved, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the angular momentum coupling.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is not about the sum of the angular momenta, but about the conservation in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the NN's orbital angular momentum changes from 0 to L.\n\nSo, the initial orbital angular momentum is 0. After emission, the NN has L, and X has l. So, 0 = L - l \u2192 L = l.\n\nBecause the orbital angular momentum is a vector, the sum of the NN's L and X's l must equal the initial 0. So, L + l =0 \u2192 L = -l \u2192 but since L and l are non-negative, this implies L=l=0.\n\nSo, X must have l=0, and the NN must have L=0.\n\nSo, looking at the options, which have X with l=0 and NN's L=0.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: X is 's' \u2192 l=0. NN's L=1 \u2192 so L\u22600 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo, none of the options have X with l=0 and NN's L=0. Thus, all options are invalid, which can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize.\n\nThe initial state has L=0, so after emission, the NN's L must be equal to the X's l (since L_initial=0 \u2192 L_final + l =0 \u2192 L_final = -l \u2192 but since they're non-negative, L_final = l =0).\n\nSo, X must have l=0, and NN must have L=0.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nWhich options have X with l=0?\n\nOption D: X is 's' \u2192 l=0.\n\nSo, option D is the only one where X has l=0.\n\nBut in option D, the final NN has L=1 \u2192 which doesn't match. So, it's invalid.\n\nSo, none of the options satisfy both parity and angular momentum conservation.\n\nBut the problem states that the final NN state has T=0, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is not just about orbital angular momentum but also spin.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum isn't conserved because the process involves a transition where the angular momentum is carried away by X, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only about parity and the Pauli condition, and angular momentum is not to be considered beyond that.\n\nBut the question says to make use of both conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the orbital angular momentum of X, not its spin.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nThe question is which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D.\n\nFrom the parity condition, only option D has the correct parity (L=1, P=-1). So, it's the only one that satisfies parity conservation.\n\nBut angular momentum isn't conserved in option D because J_NN_final=1 and J_X=0 \u2192 sum is 1\u22600.\n\nSo, option D is invalid.\n\nBut the other options have parity not conserved, so they're invalid as well.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So, perhaps the answer is that option D is not permitted because angular momentum isn't conserved, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is only about the Pauli condition and parity, and angular momentum isn't considered beyond that.\n\nBut the question explicitly says to consider both conservation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the Pauli condition. The condition given is T = S + L +1 mod2.\n\nWait, perhaps T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system.\n\nIn option D: T=0, S=0, L=1 \u2192 0 =0+1 +1 mod2 \u2192 0=2 mod2 \u2192 0=0 \u2192 condition holds.\n\nSo, Pauli condition is satisfied.\n\nParity is also conserved in option D.\n\nBut angular momentum isn't conserved because J_initial=0, J_final=1, J_X=0 \u2192 sum is 1\u22600.\n\nSo, option D is invalid.\n\nBut the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So, the answer is option D because it doesn't conserve angular momentum.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option D was the only one that satisfied parity conservation. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D is not allowed because angular momentum isn't conserved.\n\nBut the problem says to make use of both conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is option D is not permitted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the angular momentum part.\n\nWait, perhaps the total angular momentum isn't necessarily 0 after emission. Because the process is an emission, which is a transition, perhaps the initial state has J=0, and the final state's J plus X's J must equal 0. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem isn't requiring the sum of J to be zero but is more about the possible transitions based on angular momentum coupling.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option D is allowed because it satisfies parity and Pauli condition, but angular momentum isn't considered in this problem. But I'm not certain.\n\nWait, the problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So, the correct answer must satisfy both.\n\nSo, option D satisfies parity but not angular momentum. So, it's invalid.\n\nBut the other options don't satisfy parity, so they're invalid as well.\n\nThis suggests that all options are invalid, which can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the initial state's J. The initial state is 1S0 \u2192 J=0.\n\nThe final state's J (NN) plus X's J must equal 0.\n\nSo, J_NN_final + J_X =0 \u2192 J_NN_final = - J_X.\n\nSince J is a non-negative integer, the only possibility is J_NN_final= J_X=0.\n\nSo, both must have J=0.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nWhich options have J_NN_final=0 and J_X=0?\n\nOption D: J_NN_final=1 (since S=0, L=1 \u2192 J=1), J_X=0 \u2192 sum=1\u2192 invalid.\n\nNo options have both J_NN_final=0 and J_X=0.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is that none of the options are allowed, but that's not one of the choices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the way the angular momentum is handled.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is an s-wave emission, where l=0. So, X has l=0, and the NN's L changes from 0 to 0 (since L_initial=0). So, L_final=0, l=0 \u2192 L_final + l=0.\n\nIn that case, for parity, P_final = (-1)^0=1. So, 1 * (-1) =-1 \u2192 P_initial=1. So, 1 = (-1) * P_final \u2192 P_final =-1. Which would require L_final=1, which contradicts L_final=0.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the earlier analysis.\n\nOnly option D satisfies parity conservation. But it fails angular momentum conservation. So, it's invalid. Thus, the correct answer is that option D is not permitted because it doesn't conserve angular momentum.\n\nWait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So, the answer is option D is not permitted.\n\n\nThe problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) initially in the 1S0 state, which emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state has isospin \\( T(NN) = 0 \\), and the Pauli condition \\( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\, (\\text{mod } 2) \\) must be satisfied. Additionally, conservation of angular momentum and parity must be considered to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State and Parity Conservation**:\n   - The initial state is \\( 1S0 \\), which corresponds to \\( S = 0 \\), \\( L = 0 \\), and \\( J = 0 \\). The parity of the initial state is \\( P_{\\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = 1 \\).\n   - The emitted particle \\( X \\) has intrinsic parity \\( P_X = -1 \\).\n   - Parity conservation requires \\( P_{\\text{initial}} = P_{\\text{final}} \\cdot P_X \\), which simplifies to \\( P_{\\text{final}} = -1 \\). This implies that the final NN state must have an odd orbital angular momentum \\( L_{\\text{final}} \\).\n\n2. **Pauli Condition**:\n   - The Pauli condition \\( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\, (\\text{mod } 2) \\) must be satisfied for the final NN state. Since \\( T(NN) = 0 \\), this implies \\( S(NN) + L(NN) \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod } 2) \\). Therefore, \\( S(NN) + L(NN) \\) must be odd.\n\n3. **Angular Momentum Conservation**:\n   - The initial state has \\( J_{\\text{initial}} = 0 \\). After emission, the total angular momentum of the system must still sum to \\( J_{\\text{initial}} = 0 \\). This means the total angular momentum of the final NN state (\\( J_{\\text{final}} \\)) and the emitted particle \\( X \\) (\\( J_X \\)) must satisfy \\( J_{\\text{final}} + J_X = 0 \\). Since angular momentum is quantized, this requires \\( J_{\\text{final}} = J_X = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \\( 1S0 \\to 7D1 + p \\)\n     - Final NN state: \\( 7D1 \\) corresponds to \\( S = 3 \\), \\( L = 2 \\), and possible \\( J = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\). \\( J_{\\text{final}} \\neq 0 \\), so angular momentum is not conserved. Additionally, \\( L_{\\text{final}} = 2 \\) (even), violating parity conservation.\n   - **Option B**: \\( 1S0 \\to 3S1 + p \\)\n     - Final NN state: \\( 3S1 \\) corresponds to \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 0 \\), and \\( J = 1 \\). \\( J_{\\text{final}} \\neq 0 \\), so angular momentum is not conserved. Also, \\( L_{\\text{final}} = 0 \\) (even), violating parity conservation.\n   - **Option C**: \\( 1S0 \\to 3D3 + f \\)\n     - Final NN state: \\( 3D3 \\) corresponds to \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 2 \\), and possible \\( J = 1, 2, 3 \\). \\( J_{\\text{final}} \\neq 0 \\), so angular momentum is not conserved. Additionally, \\( L_{\\text{final}} = 2 \\) (even), violating parity conservation.\n   - **Option D**: \\( 1S0 \\to 3P0 + s \\)\n     - Final NN state: \\( 3P0 \\) corresponds to \\( S = 0 \\), \\( L = 1 \\), and \\( J = 1 \\). \\( J_{\\text{final}} \\neq 0 \\), so angular momentum is not conserved. However, \\( L_{\\text{final}} = 1 \\) (odd), satisfying parity conservation. The Pauli condition is also satisfied since \\( S + L = 0 + 1 = 1 \\, (\\text{mod } 2) \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Options A, B, and C are invalid because they violate parity conservation.\n- Option D satisfies parity conservation but fails angular momentum conservation because \\( J_{\\text{final}} \\neq 0 \\). Therefore, it is also invalid.\n\nThe partial wave that is not permitted is **Option D**, as it does not conserve angular momentum.\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The question is about determining which partial wave is not permitted based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws.\n\nHmm, I remember that Pauli's exclusion principle comes into play with identical particles, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact application here. The note in the question says that the term symbol is defined as (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0, that would be S=0 since the term is 1S0. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the term is given as 1S0, so that's (2S+1)=1, which implies S=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0 (since it's S state), and J=0.\n\nSo the initial NN state has S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWhen they emit a particle X, the final state must obey certain quantum numbers. The problem states that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So the isospin must equal the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum modulo 2.\n\nThe final NN state has T(NN)=0. So substituting into the equation, 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. That simplifies to S + L \u2261 -1 mod 2, but since -1 mod 2 is 1, so S + L must be 1 mod 2. Which means S and L must be of opposite parity. If S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.\n\nBut wait, the initial state was S=0 (even), L=0 (even). So after emission, what changes? The emission of a particle X. So the orbital angular momentum L of the NN system would change depending on the state of X.\n\nWait, but the initial state is 1S0, so L=0. After emitting X, the NN system would have some new L'. The parity of the system is also a factor. The initial parity is the product of the intrinsic parity of the NN state and the parity of the emitted particle X.\n\nWait, the parity of the initial state is given by the intrinsic parity of the NN system. Since the NN system is in a state with orbital angular momentum L=0, the parity is (-1)^L = 1. But wait, the parity of the NN system depends on their orbital angular momentum, but also on their spin. Wait, no, parity is purely from the orbital angular momentum. Because parity is a property that depends on spatial inversion, which affects orbital angular momentum (L) but not spin (S). So for the initial state, parity is (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nWhen the system emits a particle X, the total parity must be conserved. So the product of the parity of the final state (which is the NN system) and the parity of the emitted particle X should equal the initial parity.\n\nWait, but X is a particle emitted, so the parity of the process is the product of the parity of the initial state (P_initial), the parity of the final NN state (P_final), and the parity of X (P_X). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nParity conservation in strong interactions (like emission of pions or other mesons) is conserved. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the type of interaction, but since it's about particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1, perhaps we can consider that the parity must be conserved.\n\nWait, the initial parity is (parity of NN system) = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1. The final state consists of the NN system (with L_final) and the emitted X. So the parity of the entire final state would be the product of the parity of the NN system (after emission) and the parity of X.\n\nBut in terms of the process, the total parity before and after should be the same. So P_initial = P_final. So,\n\nP_initial = (+1) = [P_NN_final * P_X]\n\nWe know that P_X is -1. So,\n\n1 = [P_NN_final * (-1)]\n\nWhich implies P_NN_final = -1. Because 1 = (-1) * (-1) \u2192 -1 * something is 1. So P_NN_final is -1.\n\nThe parity of the NN system in the final state is (-1)^(L_final) because parity is determined by the orbital angular momentum L. So,\n\n(-1)^(L_final) = -1 \u2192 which implies that L_final is odd because (-1)^odd = -1. So L_final must be odd.\n\nWait, but earlier we have that the final NN state has T=0. And from the condition, T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nSo S and L must have opposite parity. If L is odd, then S must be even. Because odd + even = odd, which mod 2 is 1.\n\nSo the final state's NN system has L_final odd, and S_final even.\n\nBut what is S_final? The initial S was 0. When emitting a particle, the spin of the NN system could change? Or is the spin conserved? Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, the spin S is the total spin of the NN system. If they emit a spin-0 particle (like a pion, which is a pseudoscalar meson, spin 0), then the spin of the NN system would remain the same. Because emitting a spin-0 particle doesn't change the total spin of the system. So if the initial S was 0, the final S would also be 0. Because S_initial = S_final + S_X. But if S_X is 0, then S_final = S_initial = 0.\n\nSo in the final state, S_final = 0, which is even. And L_final is odd.\n\nSo from T = S + L +1 mod 2, let's plug in the numbers. S=0, L is odd. So 0 + L = odd. Then T = (odd) +1 mod 2. So T = (odd +1) mod 2 \u2192 (even) mod 2 is 0. Which matches the given condition T=0.\n\nSo all that makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is about the partial waves emitted. The options are various transitions from 1S0 to other states plus a particle. The particle X could be a pion, which is a pseudoscalar (spin 0, parity -1), but the question doesn't specify. But the options have p, s, f, etc., which correspond to the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers l.\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nA) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\nB) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\nC) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\nD) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n\nWait, the notation is 1S0 \u2192 something + something. I think the first part is the final state of the NN system, and the second is the emitted particle.\n\nSo for each option, the final state is (2S'+1)L'(J'), and the emitted particle has a certain orbital angular momentum l (denoted by the letter: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc.)\n\nWait, but when a particle is emitted, it carries away some orbital angular momentum. The orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (X) is denoted by the lowercase letter. So for example, in option A, the emitted particle is p, which is l=1.\n\nThe total orbital angular momentum of the system (NN) after emission will be L_final. The orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is l. So the initial orbital angular momentum L_initial was 0 (since it's 1S0). After emission, the total orbital angular momentum of the system plus the emitted particle must be conserved. But since the NN system is emitting a particle, the orbital angular momentum L_final of the NN plus the orbital angular momentum l of X must equal the initial L (which was 0). Wait, but that's not possible because L_final can't be negative. Wait, no, angular momentum is conserved, so the total orbital angular momentum before and after must be the same. But the initial L was 0, so the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN system and X must be zero. But that's not possible unless both have L=0. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up orbital angular momentum and total angular momentum. Let me think again. The initial state has L=0 for the NN system. When the system emits a particle X, which has orbital angular momentum l (denoted by p, s, etc.), the NN system must have L' such that L' + l = 0 (mod angular momentum conservation). But since L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system, and l is the orbital angular momentum of X, their sum should equal the initial L (which is 0). So:\n\nL' + l = L_initial = 0 \u2192 L' = -l.\n\nBut L' and l are magnitudes, so L' must equal l, but since angular momentum is a vector, the only way this holds is if L' = l and the directions are opposite. But that's only possible if L' = l = 0. Wait, but that's only possible if both are zero. But in the options, the emitted particles have l values of 1 (p), 0 (s), 2 (d), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe the total angular momentum J is conserved, not just the orbital part. But the problem states to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system (L') and the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (l) must satisfy L' = l, because in the center-of-mass frame, the total orbital angular momentum must be zero. Wait, no, because in the initial state, the total orbital angular momentum is zero (L_initial = 0). So when the system emits a particle, the total orbital angular momentum of the system (L') and the emitted particle (l) must sum to zero.\n\nSo, L' + l = 0 \u2192 L' = -l. But L' and l are magnitudes, so this would imply that L' = l, but the direction is opposite. But that's not possible because L' and l are non-negative integers. Wait, no. Because orbital angular momentum is quantized in integer values, L' and l must each be non-negative. So the only way L' + l = 0 is if L' = l = 0. But in the options, the emitted particles have l values of 1, 0, 2, etc. So that can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me think again. The initial state is 1S0, which has L=0. The final state of the NN system has some L', and the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l. The total orbital angular momentum after emission is L' + l, but since the initial was L=0, we have L' + l = 0. But that's only possible if L' = l = 0. So the only allowed emission would be when l=0, which is an s-wave. But in the options, some have l>0, so that would make their L' = -l, which is impossible because L' must be a non-negative integer.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the parity is the key here, because the orbital angular momentum affects the parity.\n\nEarlier, I concluded that the final NN system must have L' odd, so L' is 1, 3, etc. Because L' must be odd, as the parity of the NN system is -1, which is (-1)^L' \u2192 L' must be odd.\n\nSo looking at the options, each option's final NN state has a certain L'. Let's extract L' from each option.\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 D is l=2, so L'=2. But wait, the term symbol is (2S'+1)L'(J'). So for 7D1, 2S'+1=7 \u2192 S'=3. L'=2 (D). So L' is 2, which is even. But earlier, we determined that L' must be odd. So this would not be allowed. So option A would be forbidden because L' is even, but we need L' to be odd.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 S is l=0. So L'=0. But that's even, so it's not allowed. So option B would be forbidden.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 D is l=2. So L'=2 (even). Not allowed.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 P is l=1. So L'=1 (odd). Allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier conclusion was that L' must be odd. So options A, B, C have L' even, which would not be allowed, but D has L' odd, which is allowed.\n\nBut wait, the problem says which partial wave is not permitted. So which option is not allowed. So all except D would be forbidden, but the options are four, each with different L'.\n\nWait, but looking back, the problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So according to the condition, S + L +1 \u2261 0 mod 2.\n\nIn the final state, S is the spin of the NN system. Earlier, I thought that S remains 0 because the emitted particle has spin 0. So S=0. Then L' must be odd (since 0 + L' +1 = 1 mod 2 \u2192 0 + L' must be 1 mod 2 \u2192 L' is odd).\n\nSo the final state must have L' odd. So any option where the NN system has even L' is forbidden.\n\nLooking again:\n\nOption A: L' = 2 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption B: L'=0 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption C: L'=2 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption D: L'=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 allowed.\n\nSo the forbidden options are A, B, and C. But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. The options are four, each has a different emitted particle and a different L'.\n\nWait, but the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l must satisfy L' + l = 0. Because initial L was 0. So L' = -l \u2192 which isn't possible unless l=0 and L'=0.\n\nWait, that can't be. So I must have made a mistake here. Because if L' + l = 0, then L' = -l, but L' and l are magnitudes, so they can't be negative. So the only way this works is if L' = l = 0.\n\nWait, that would mean the emitted particle must have l=0 (s-wave). Because any other l would require L' to be negative, which isn't possible.\n\nSo that suggests that the only allowed emission is in the s-wave, i.e., l=0. So any option where the emitted particle has l>0 is forbidden.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) emitted p \u2192 l=1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nB) emitted p \u2192 l=1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nC) emitted f \u2192 l=3 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nD) emitted s \u2192 l=0 \u2192 allowed.\n\nSo the forbidden partial waves are A, B, and C. But the question is which one is not permitted, so the correct answer would be any of those. But the options are given as four, and the question asks which is not permitted.\n\nWait, but the options are labeled A to D, each involving different transitions. So for each option, we have the final state of the NN and the emitted particle.\n\nBut according to the above reasoning, only option D is allowed, so the others are forbidden. So the question is which is not permitted, so the correct answer would be any of A, B, C.\n\nBut the options have only one correct answer. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that L' must be equal to l. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should be considering the total angular momentum J of the NN system. The initial state has J=0. The final state has J', and the emitted particle has j. The total angular momentum must be conserved: J' + j = 0. But J' and j are non-negative, so the only possibility is J' = j = 0. But that would require the final state of the NN system to have J=0, and the emitted particle to have j=0.\n\nBut looking at the options, each has a J for the NN system:\n\nOption A: J'=1 \u2192 emitted X has j=1? No, because 1 + j=0 \u2192 j would be -1, which is impossible. So option A is forbidden because J' + j must equal J_initial=0.\n\nBut the problem says to consider angular momentum conservation, so that's another constraint.\n\nWait, but in reality, when a particle is emitted, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the total J after emission is the sum (vectorially) of the NN system's J' and the emitted particle's j. So J_initial = 0 = J' + j. Which implies that J' = -j. But J' and j are magnitudes, so the only way this works is if J'=j=0. So the final NN system must have J'=0, and the emitted particle must have j=0.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: J'=1 \u2192 j would have to be -1, which is impossible. So forbidden.\n\nOption B: J'=1 \u2192 same problem. Forbidden.\n\nOption C: J'=3 \u2192 same issue. Forbidden.\n\nOption D: J'=0 \u2192 j=0. So allowed.\n\nSo according to this, only option D is allowed. Thus, the others are forbidden.\n\nBut wait, what about the parity? Let me go back to that. The initial parity is +1.\n\nThe parity after emission is P_NN_final * P_X. We have P_NN_final = (-1)^L' = (-1)^1 = -1 (since L' must be odd). P_X is given as -1. So P_NN_final * P_X = (-1)*(-1) = +1, which matches the initial parity. So parity is conserved.\n\nBut in the other options, let's check parity:\n\nOption A: L'=2 (even) \u2192 P_NN_final = (+1). P_X is -1. So 1 * (-1) = -1, which doesn't match initial parity of +1. So forbidden.\n\nOption B: L'=0 \u2192 P_NN_final = +1. P_X = -1 \u2192 product -1. Not allowed.\n\nOption C: L'=2 \u2192 P_NN_final = +1. P_X = -1 \u2192 product -1. Not allowed.\n\nOption D: L'=1 \u2192 P_NN_final = -1. P_X = -1 \u2192 product +1. Allowed.\n\nSo only option D is allowed, and the others are forbidden.\n\nWait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the correct answer is any option that is not D. So in the given options, options A, B, C are forbidden.\n\nBut looking back at the options, the letters are A, B, C, D. The question is which is not permitted. So the correct answer is either A, B, or C.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) 1S0 \u21927D1 + p\n\nB) \u21923S1 + p\n\nC) \u21923D3 + f\n\nD) \u21923P0 + s\n\nFrom the earlier reasoning, only D is allowed, so the others are not permitted. But the question is which one is not permitted, so all except D are forbidden. But the options present four possibilities, and the question asks which is not permitted. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nEmit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1.\n\nThe final state of NN must have T=0.\n\nPauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 0 = S + L +1 \u2192 S + L = 1 mod 2.\n\nSo S and L must have opposite parity.\n\nThe final state's NN has some S' and L'.\n\nBut since the initial S was 0, and if the emitted particle X has spin 0, then S' must be 0. Because S_initial = S' + S_X. If S_X=0, then S'=0.\n\nSo in the final state, S'=0.\n\nThus, the Pauli condition becomes 0 + L' = 1 mod 2 \u2192 L' =1 mod 2. So L' must be odd.\n\nSo the final NN state must have L' odd.\n\nNow, considering the parity: initial parity is +1.\n\nFinal parity is (parity of NN system) \u00d7 (parity of X).\n\nParity of NN system is (-1)^L' = (-1)^1 = -1 (since L' is odd).\n\nParity of X is -1.\n\nSo final parity is (-1) \u00d7 (-1) = +1, which matches initial. So parity is conserved.\n\nNow, considering angular momentum:\n\nThe initial J was 0. After emission, the NN system has J', and X has j. The total J must be conserved.\n\nSo J_initial = 0 = J' + j.\n\nWhich implies J' = -j. But since J' and j are magnitudes, the only way this works is if J' = j = 0.\n\nSo the final NN system must have J' =0, and the emitted particle must have j=0.\n\nSo looking at the options, which have J' and j.\n\nEach option gives the final NN state as (2S'+1)L'(J').\n\nSo for each option:\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 S'=3 (since 2S'+1=7 \u2192 S'=3), L'=2, J'=1.\n\nSo J' is 1. Then j must be -1, which is impossible. So this option is forbidden.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 S'=1 (2S'+1=3 \u2192 S'=1), L'=0, J'=1.\n\nJ'=1 \u2192 j must be -1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 S'=1, L'=2, J'=3.\n\nJ'=3 \u2192 j=-3 \u2192 impossible. Forbidden.\n\nOption D:3P0 \u2192 S'=1, L'=1, J'=0.\n\nJ'=0 \u2192 j=0. So this is allowed.\n\nThus, the only allowed option is D, so the others (A, B, C) are forbidden. But the question is which partial wave is not permitted, so the correct answer would be any of A, B, or C.\n\nWait, but the options give each a different emitted particle. Let me check their orbital angular momentum l.\n\nIn the options, the emitted particles are:\n\nA) p \u2192 l=1.\n\nB) p \u2192 l=1.\n\nC) f \u2192 l=3.\n\nD) s \u2192 l=0.\n\nBut earlier, when considering orbital angular momentum conservation, the initial L was 0. So the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN system (L') and the emitted particle (l) must be 0. So L' + l = 0 \u2192 L' = -l. But L' and l are non-negative integers, so the only possibility is L' = l =0. So any emitted particle with l>0 would require L' = -l, which is impossible.\n\nSo the only allowed emission is when l=0 \u2192 s-wave. So options A, B, C emit particles with l>0 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nThus, the correct answer is any of A, B, or C. But the options are four, and the question is which one is not permitted.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as which partial wave is not permitted. So the forbidden ones are A, B, C, and D is allowed.\n\nBut the options are four, and the question gives four options, each with a different emitted particle. So the correct answer is any of the options except D. But the question asks which is not permitted, so all except D are not permitted.\n\nBut the options are four, and the question is to choose one. So perhaps the correct answer is option C. But I'm a bit confused because the reasoning suggests that all except D are forbidden.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the options where L' is even. Because earlier, I concluded that L' must be odd. So any option where L' is even is forbidden.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: L'=2 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption B: L'=0 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption C: L'=2 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption D: L'=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 allowed.\n\nSo the forbidden options are A, B, C. So the correct answer is any of them. But the question asks which is not permitted, so it's either A, B, or C.\n\nBut the options are four, and the question is to choose one. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l must be such that the total orbital angular momentum of the system (L') and the emitted particle (l) sum to the initial L=0. So L' + l =0 \u2192 L' = -l. But since L' and l are non-negative, the only possibility is L'=0 and l=0.\n\nThus, the emitted particle must have l=0 (s-wave). So any option where the emitted particle has l>0 is forbidden.\n\nSo looking at the options:\n\nA) p \u2192 l=1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nB) p \u2192 l=1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nC) f \u2192 l=3 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nD) s \u2192 l=0 \u2192 allowed.\n\nSo the forbidden options are A, B, C. So the correct answer is any of them. But the question is which is not permitted, so the correct answer is the one that is not D.\n\nBut the question gives four options, and the correct one is the one that is not allowed. So the answer would be the one that doesn't meet the parity condition, angular momentum condition, etc.\n\nWait, but let's think about the parity for each option:\n\nOption A: L'=2 \u2192 parity of NN is +1. X has parity -1. So product is -1. Initial parity was +1 \u2192 parity not conserved. So forbidden.\n\nOption B: L'=0 \u2192 parity of NN is +1. X parity -1 \u2192 product -1. Not conserved. Forbidden.\n\nOption C: L'=2 \u2192 parity of NN is +1. X parity -1 \u2192 product -1. Not conserved. Forbidden.\n\nOption D: L'=1 \u2192 parity of NN is -1. X parity -1 \u2192 product +1. Conserved. Allowed.\n\nSo all except D are forbidden. Thus, the answer is any of A, B, C. But the question is which is not permitted, so the correct answer is any of them. But the options are four, and the question expects a single choice.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to determine which option violates both the angular momentum and parity conditions. Let's go through each option.\n\nOption A: 7D1 + p.\n\n- L'=2 (even) \u2192 violates L' must be odd \u2192 forbidden.\n\n- J'=1 \u2192 requires j=-1 \u2192 impossible \u2192 forbidden.\n\n- Parity: L'=2 \u2192 parity +1. X parity -1 \u2192 product -1. Doesn't match initial +1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nSo option A is forbidden.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p.\n\n- L'=0 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\n- J'=1 \u2192 j=-1 \u2192 impossible \u2192 forbidden.\n\n- Parity: L'=0 \u2192 +1. X parity -1 \u2192 product -1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption B forbidden.\n\nOption C: 3D3 + f.\n\n- L'=2 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\n- J'=3 \u2192 j=-3 \u2192 impossible \u2192 forbidden.\n\n- Parity: L'=2 \u2192 +1. X parity -1 \u2192 product -1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption C forbidden.\n\nOption D: 3P0 + s.\n\n- L'=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 allowed.\n\n- J'=0 \u2192 j=0 \u2192 allowed.\n\n- Parity: L'=1 \u2192 -1. X parity -1 \u2192 product +1 \u2192 allowed.\n\nThus, option D is allowed, others are forbidden.\n\nSo the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the correct answer is any of A, B, C. But the options are four, and the question expects one answer. So the answer is the one that is not D.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as four, and the question is to choose which one is not permitted. So the correct answer is any of A, B, or C.\n\nBut the options are four, and the correct answer is the one that doesn't meet the conditions. So among the options, the correct answer is either A, B, or C.\n\nWait, looking back, the question says \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted\", and the options are labeled A-D.\n\nSo the correct answer must be one of them. From the analysis, all except D are forbidden. So the answer is either A, B, or C.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA) 1S0 \u21927D1 + p\n\nB) \u21923S1 + p\n\nC) \u21923D3 + f\n\nD) \u21923P0 + s\n\nSo the allowed option is D. Thus, the forbidden are A, B, C.\n\nBut the question is which is not permitted, so the correct answer is any of them.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the parity and angular momentum conditions again.\n\nThe initial state has parity +1. The final state must have parity (parity of NN) * (parity of X) = +1.\n\nParity of NN is (-1)^L' \u2192 must be -1 (so L' is odd).\n\nParity of X is -1.\n\nSo (-1)^L' * (-1) = +1 \u2192 (-1)^(L' +1) = +1 \u2192 L' +1 must be even \u2192 L' is odd.\n\nSo L' is odd.\n\nNow, looking at the options, which have L' as part of their term symbols.\n\nOption A:7D1 \u2192 L'=2 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption B:3S1 \u2192 L'=0 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption C:3D3 \u2192 L'=2 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption D:3P0 \u2192 L'=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 allowed.\n\nThus, options A, B, C are forbidden because L' is even. Only D is allowed.\n\nSo the answer is any of A, B, C.\n\nBut the question asks which is not permitted. So the correct answer is the one that doesn't meet the condition.\n\nSo the answer is option C, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, all A, B, C are forbidden.\n\nWait, the question is to choose which is not permitted, so the correct answer is any of A, B, or C.\n\nBut the options are four, and the question expects one letter. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but I'm not confident. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l must be such that the total angular momentum is conserved.\n\nThe initial J is 0.\n\nThe final J' (NN) plus j (X) must sum to 0.\n\nSo J' + j = 0 \u2192 J' = j.\n\nBut J' and j are non-negative, so the only solution is J' = j = 0.\n\nSo the emitted particle must have j=0. Which means it's an s-wave (l=0).\n\nSo any option where the emitted particle has l>0 is forbidden.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) p \u2192 l=1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nB) p \u2192 l=1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nC) f \u2192 l=3 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nD) s \u2192 l=0 \u2192 allowed.\n\nThus, options A, B, C are forbidden.\n\nSo the answer is any of A, B, C.\n\nBut the question gives four options, and the correct answer is one of them.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because its emitted particle is f (l=3), which is higher, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C because when you add L' and l, L' + l must be zero.\n\nWait, no, earlier reasoning suggests that the sum of L' and l must be zero, which is only possible if both are zero.\n\nThus, the only allowed option is D.\n\nSo the forbidden options are A, B, C.\n\nThus, the answer is any of them. But the question is to choose one.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because it has the highest l, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the option where L' is even and J' is not zero.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis, the only allowed option is D, so the others are forbidden. Thus, the correct answer is any of A, B, C. But since the question expects a single answer, perhaps the correct option is option C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state (S=0, L=0, J=0) emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state has T=0, and the Pauli condition requires that T = S + L + 1 (mod 2). This implies that S and L must have opposite parity for the final state. Additionally, parity conservation requires that the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of X matches the initial parity of +1. Since X has parity -1, the final NN state must have parity -1, which means its orbital angular momentum L' must be odd.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: The NN system starts in a 1S0 state with S=0, L=0, and J=0.\n2. **Final State Constraints**:\n   - The final NN state must have T=0, which requires S' + L' \u2261 1 (mod 2). Since S'=0 (emitting a spin-0 particle), L' must be odd.\n   - Parity conservation: The parity of the final NN state is (-1)^{L'}, and since X has parity -1, the product (-1)^{L'} \u00d7 (-1) must equal the initial parity of +1. This confirms that L' must be odd.\n   - Angular momentum conservation: The total angular momentum J_initial = 0 must equal the sum of the final NN system's angular momentum J' and the emitted particle's angular momentum j. This implies J' = j = 0 for the emitted particle.\n\n3. **Emission of Particle X**:\n   - The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. Its orbital angular momentum l determines the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission. Since the initial orbital angular momentum L=0, the final orbital angular momentum of the NN system (L') and the orbital angular momentum of X (l) must satisfy L' + l = 0. This is only possible if L' = l = 0, meaning X must be emitted in an s-wave (l=0).\n\n### Evaluation of Options:\n- **Option A**: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p  \n  - Final NN state: L'=2 (even), which violates the requirement that L' must be odd.  \n  - Forbidden.\n\n- **Option B**: 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p  \n  - Final NN state: L'=0 (even), which violates the requirement that L' must be odd.  \n  - Forbidden.\n\n- **Option C**: 1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f  \n  - Final NN state: L'=2 (even), which violates the requirement that L' must be odd.  \n  - Forbidden.\n\n- **Option D**: 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s  \n  - Final NN state: L'=1 (odd), satisfying the parity and angular momentum conditions.  \n  - Emitted particle: s-wave (l=0), satisfying angular momentum conservation.  \n  - Allowed.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only allowed option is D. The other options (A, B, and C) are forbidden because they violate the parity and angular momentum conservation conditions.\n\n**Answer: C**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The question is about determining which partial wave is not permitted based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws.\n\nHmm, I remember that Pauli's exclusion principle comes into play with identical particles, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact application here. The note in the question says that the term symbol is defined as (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0, that would be S=0 since the term is 1S0. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the term is given as 1S0, so that's (2S+1)=1, which implies S=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0 (since it's S state), and J=0.\n\nSo the initial NN state has S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWhen they emit a particle X, the final state must obey certain quantum numbers. The problem states that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So the isospin must equal the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum modulo 2.\n\nThe final NN state has T(NN)=0. So substituting into the equation, 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. That simplifies to S + L \u2261 -1 mod 2, but since -1 mod 2 is 1, so S + L must be 1 mod 2. Which means S and L must be of opposite parity. If S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.\n\nBut wait, the initial state was S=0 (even), L=0 (even). So after emission, what changes? The emission of a particle X. So the orbital angular momentum L of the NN system would change depending on the state of X.\n\nWait, but the initial state is 1S0, so L=0. After emitting X, the NN system would have some new L'. The parity of the system is also a factor. The initial parity is the product of the intrinsic parity of the NN state and the parity of the emitted particle X.\n\nWait, the parity of the initial state is given by the intrinsic parity of the NN system. Since the NN system is in a state with orbital angular momentum L=0, the parity is (-1)^L = 1. But wait, the parity of the NN system depends on their orbital angular momentum, but also on their spin. Wait, no, parity is purely from the orbital angular momentum. Because parity is a property that depends on spatial inversion, which affects orbital angular momentum (L) but not spin (S). So for the initial state, parity is (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nWhen the system emits a particle X, the total parity must be conserved. So the product of the parity of the final state (which is the NN system) and the parity of the emitted particle X should equal the initial parity.\n\nWait, but X is a particle emitted, so the parity of the process is the product of the parity of the initial state (P_initial), the parity of the final NN state (P_final), and the parity of X (P_X). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nParity conservation in strong interactions (like emission of pions or other mesons) is conserved. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the type of interaction, but since it's about particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1, perhaps we can consider that the parity must be conserved.\n\nWait, the initial parity is (parity of NN system) = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1. The final state consists of the NN system (with L_final) and the emitted X. So the parity of the entire final state would be the product of the parity of the NN system (after emission) and the parity of X.\n\nBut in terms of the process, the total parity before and after should be the same. So P_initial = P_final. So,\n\nP_initial = (+1) = [P_NN_final * P_X]\n\nWe know that P_X is -1. So,\n\n1 = [P_NN_final * (-1)]\n\nWhich implies P_NN_final = -1. Because 1 = (-1) * (-1) \u2192 -1 * something is 1. So P_NN_final is -1.\n\nThe parity of the NN system in the final state is (-1)^(L_final) because parity is determined by the orbital angular momentum L. So,\n\n(-1)^(L_final) = -1 \u2192 which implies that L_final is odd because (-1)^odd = -1. So L_final must be odd.\n\nWait, but earlier we have that the final NN state has T=0. And from the condition, T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nSo S and L must have opposite parity. If L is odd, then S must be even. Because odd + even = odd, which mod 2 is 1.\n\nSo the final state's NN system has L_final odd, and S_final even.\n\nBut what is S_final? The initial S was 0. When emitting a particle, the spin of the NN system could change? Or is the spin conserved? Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, the spin S is the total spin of the NN system. If they emit a spin-0 particle (like a pion, which is a pseudoscalar meson, spin 0), then the spin of the NN system would remain the same. Because emitting a spin-0 particle doesn't change the total spin of the system. So if the initial S was 0, the final S would also be 0. Because S_initial = S_final + S_X. But if S_X is 0, then S_final = S_initial = 0.\n\nSo in the final state, S_final = 0, which is even. And L_final is odd.\n\nSo from T = S + L +1 mod 2, let's plug in the numbers. S=0, L is odd. So 0 + L = odd. Then T = (odd) +1 mod 2. So T = (odd +1) mod 2 \u2192 (even) mod 2 is 0. Which matches the given condition T=0.\n\nSo all that makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is about the partial waves emitted. The options are various transitions from 1S0 to other states plus a particle. The particle X could be a pion, which is a pseudoscalar (spin 0, parity -1), but the question doesn't specify. But the options have p, s, f, etc., which correspond to the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers l.\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nA) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\nB) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\nC) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\nD) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n\nWait, the notation is 1S0 \u2192 something + something. I think the first part is the final state of the NN system, and the second is the emitted particle.\n\nSo for each option, the final state is (2S'+1)L'(J'), and the emitted particle has a certain orbital angular momentum l (denoted by the letter: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc.)\n\nWait, but when a particle is emitted, it carries away some orbital angular momentum. The orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (X) is denoted by the lowercase letter. So for example, in option A, the emitted particle is p, which is l=1.\n\nThe total orbital angular momentum of the system (NN) after emission will be L_final. The orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is l. So the initial orbital angular momentum L_initial was 0 (since it's 1S0). After emission, the total orbital angular momentum of the system plus the emitted particle must be conserved. But since the NN system is emitting a particle, the orbital angular momentum L_final of the NN plus the orbital angular momentum l of X must equal the initial L (which was 0). Wait, but that's not possible because L_final can't be negative. Wait, no, angular momentum is conserved, so the total orbital angular momentum before and after must be the same. But the initial L was 0, so the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN system and X must be zero. But that's not possible unless both have L=0. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up orbital angular momentum and total angular momentum. Let me think again. The initial state has L=0 for the NN system. When the system emits a particle X, which has orbital angular momentum l (denoted by p, s, etc.), the NN system must have L' such that L' + l = 0 (mod angular momentum conservation). But since L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system, and l is the orbital angular momentum of X, their sum should equal the initial L (which is 0). So:\n\nL' + l = L_initial = 0 \u2192 L' = -l.\n\nBut L' and l are magnitudes, so L' must equal l, but since angular momentum is a vector, the only way this holds is if L' = l and the directions are opposite. But that's only possible if L' = l = 0. Wait, but that's only possible if both are zero. But in the options, the emitted particles have l values of 1 (p), 0 (s), 2 (d), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe the total angular momentum J is conserved, not just the orbital part. But the problem states to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system (L') and the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (l) must satisfy L' = l, because in the center-of-mass frame, the total orbital angular momentum must be zero. Wait, no, because in the initial state, the total orbital angular momentum is zero (L_initial = 0). So when the system emits a particle, the total orbital angular momentum of the system (L') and the emitted particle (l) must sum to zero.\n\nSo, L' + l = 0 \u2192 L' = -l. But L' and l are magnitudes, so this would imply that L' = l, but the direction is opposite. But that's not possible because L' and l are non-negative integers. Wait, no. Because orbital angular momentum is quantized in integer values, L' and l must each be non-negative. So the only way L' + l = 0 is if L' = l = 0. But in the options, the emitted particles have l values of 1, 0, 2, etc. So that can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me think again. The initial state is 1S0, which has L=0. The final state of the NN system has some L', and the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l. The total orbital angular momentum after emission is L' + l, but since the initial was L=0, we have L' + l = 0. But that's only possible if L' = l = 0. So the only allowed emission would be when l=0, which is an s-wave. But in the options, some have l>0, so that would make their L' = -l, which is impossible because L' must be a non-negative integer.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the parity is the key here, because the orbital angular momentum affects the parity.\n\nEarlier, I concluded that the final NN system must have L' odd, so L' is 1, 3, etc. Because L' must be odd, as the parity of the NN system is -1, which is (-1)^L' \u2192 L' must be odd.\n\nSo looking at the options, each option's final NN state has a certain L'. Let's extract L' from each option.\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 D is l=2, so L'=2. But wait, the term symbol is (2S'+1)L'(J'). So for 7D1, 2S'+1=7 \u2192 S'=3. L'=2 (D). So L' is 2, which is even. But earlier, we determined that L' must be odd. So this would not be allowed. So option A would be forbidden because L' is even, but we need L' to be odd.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 S is l=0. So L'=0. But that's even, so it's not allowed. So option B would be forbidden.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 D is l=2. So L'=2 (even). Not allowed.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 P is l=1. So L'=1 (odd). Allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier conclusion was that L' must be odd. So options A, B, C have L' even, which would not be allowed, but D has L' odd, which is allowed.\n\nBut wait, the problem says which partial wave is not permitted. So which option is not allowed. So all except D would be forbidden, but the options are four, each with different L'.\n\nWait, but looking back, the problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So according to the condition, S + L +1 \u2261 0 mod 2.\n\nIn the final state, S is the spin of the NN system. Earlier, I thought that S remains 0 because the emitted particle has spin 0. So S=0. Then L' must be odd (since 0 + L' +1 = 1 mod 2 \u2192 0 + L' must be 1 mod 2 \u2192 L' is odd).\n\nSo the final state must have L' odd. So any option where the NN system has even L' is forbidden.\n\nLooking again:\n\nOption A: L' = 2 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption B: L'=0 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption C: L'=2 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption D: L'=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 allowed.\n\nSo the forbidden options are A, B, and C. But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. The options are four, each has a different emitted particle and a different L'.\n\nWait, but the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l must satisfy L' + l = 0. Because initial L was 0. So L' = -l \u2192 which isn't possible unless l=0 and L'=0.\n\nWait, that can't be. So I must have made a mistake here. Because if L' + l = 0, then L' = -l, but L' and l are magnitudes, so they can't be negative. So the only way this works is if L' = l = 0.\n\nWait, that would mean the emitted particle must have l=0 (s-wave). Because any other l would require L' to be negative, which isn't possible.\n\nSo that suggests that the only allowed emission is in the s-wave, i.e., l=0. So any option where the emitted particle has l>0 is forbidden.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) emitted p \u2192 l=1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nB) emitted p \u2192 l=1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nC) emitted f \u2192 l=3 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nD) emitted s \u2192 l=0 \u2192 allowed.\n\nSo the forbidden partial waves are A, B, and C. But the question is which one is not permitted, so the correct answer would be any of those. But the options are given as four, and the question asks which is not permitted.\n\nWait, but the options are labeled A to D, each involving different transitions. So for each option, we have the final state of the NN and the emitted particle.\n\nBut according to the above reasoning, only option D is allowed, so the others are forbidden. So the question is which is not permitted, so the correct answer would be any of A, B, C.\n\nBut the options have only one correct answer. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that L' must be equal to l. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should be considering the total angular momentum J of the NN system. The initial state has J=0. The final state has J', and the emitted particle has j. The total angular momentum must be conserved: J' + j = 0. But J' and j are non-negative, so the only possibility is J' = j = 0. But that would require the final state of the NN system to have J=0, and the emitted particle to have j=0.\n\nBut looking at the options, each has a J for the NN system:\n\nOption A: J'=1 \u2192 emitted X has j=1? No, because 1 + j=0 \u2192 j would be -1, which is impossible. So option A is forbidden because J' + j must equal J_initial=0.\n\nBut the problem says to consider angular momentum conservation, so that's another constraint.\n\nWait, but in reality, when a particle is emitted, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the total J after emission is the sum (vectorially) of the NN system's J' and the emitted particle's j. So J_initial = 0 = J' + j. Which implies that J' = -j. But J' and j are magnitudes, so the only way this works is if J'=j=0. So the final NN system must have J'=0, and the emitted particle must have j=0.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: J'=1 \u2192 j would have to be -1, which is impossible. So forbidden.\n\nOption B: J'=1 \u2192 same problem. Forbidden.\n\nOption C: J'=3 \u2192 same issue. Forbidden.\n\nOption D: J'=0 \u2192 j=0. So allowed.\n\nSo according to this, only option D is allowed. Thus, the others are forbidden.\n\nBut wait, what about the parity? Let me go back to that. The initial parity is +1.\n\nThe parity after emission is P_NN_final * P_X. We have P_NN_final = (-1)^L' = (-1)^1 = -1 (since L' must be odd). P_X is given as -1. So P_NN_final * P_X = (-1)*(-1) = +1, which matches the initial parity. So parity is conserved.\n\nBut in the other options, let's check parity:\n\nOption A: L'=2 (even) \u2192 P_NN_final = (+1). P_X is -1. So 1 * (-1) = -1, which doesn't match initial parity of +1. So forbidden.\n\nOption B: L'=0 \u2192 P_NN_final = +1. P_X = -1 \u2192 product -1. Not allowed.\n\nOption C: L'=2 \u2192 P_NN_final = +1. P_X = -1 \u2192 product -1. Not allowed.\n\nOption D: L'=1 \u2192 P_NN_final = -1. P_X = -1 \u2192 product +1. Allowed.\n\nSo only option D is allowed, and the others are forbidden.\n\nWait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the correct answer is any option that is not D. So in the given options, options A, B, C are forbidden.\n\nBut looking back at the options, the letters are A, B, C, D. The question is which is not permitted. So the correct answer is either A, B, or C.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) 1S0 \u21927D1 + p\n\nB) \u21923S1 + p\n\nC) \u21923D3 + f\n\nD) \u21923P0 + s\n\nFrom the earlier reasoning, only D is allowed, so the others are not permitted. But the question is which one is not permitted, so all except D are forbidden. But the options present four possibilities, and the question asks which is not permitted. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nEmit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1.\n\nThe final state of NN must have T=0.\n\nPauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 0 = S + L +1 \u2192 S + L = 1 mod 2.\n\nSo S and L must have opposite parity.\n\nThe final state's NN has some S' and L'.\n\nBut since the initial S was 0, and if the emitted particle X has spin 0, then S' must be 0. Because S_initial = S' + S_X. If S_X=0, then S'=0.\n\nSo in the final state, S'=0.\n\nThus, the Pauli condition becomes 0 + L' = 1 mod 2 \u2192 L' =1 mod 2. So L' must be odd.\n\nSo the final NN state must have L' odd.\n\nNow, considering the parity: initial parity is +1.\n\nFinal parity is (parity of NN system) \u00d7 (parity of X).\n\nParity of NN system is (-1)^L' = (-1)^1 = -1 (since L' is odd).\n\nParity of X is -1.\n\nSo final parity is (-1) \u00d7 (-1) = +1, which matches initial. So parity is conserved.\n\nNow, considering angular momentum:\n\nThe initial J was 0. After emission, the NN system has J', and X has j. The total J must be conserved.\n\nSo J_initial = 0 = J' + j.\n\nWhich implies J' = -j. But since J' and j are magnitudes, the only way this works is if J' = j = 0.\n\nSo the final NN system must have J' =0, and the emitted particle must have j=0.\n\nSo looking at the options, which have J' and j.\n\nEach option gives the final NN state as (2S'+1)L'(J').\n\nSo for each option:\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 S'=3 (since 2S'+1=7 \u2192 S'=3), L'=2, J'=1.\n\nSo J' is 1. Then j must be -1, which is impossible. So this option is forbidden.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 S'=1 (2S'+1=3 \u2192 S'=1), L'=0, J'=1.\n\nJ'=1 \u2192 j must be -1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 S'=1, L'=2, J'=3.\n\nJ'=3 \u2192 j=-3 \u2192 impossible. Forbidden.\n\nOption D:3P0 \u2192 S'=1, L'=1, J'=0.\n\nJ'=0 \u2192 j=0. So this is allowed.\n\nThus, the only allowed option is D, so the others (A, B, C) are forbidden. But the question is which partial wave is not permitted, so the correct answer would be any of A, B, or C.\n\nWait, but the options give each a different emitted particle. Let me check their orbital angular momentum l.\n\nIn the options, the emitted particles are:\n\nA) p \u2192 l=1.\n\nB) p \u2192 l=1.\n\nC) f \u2192 l=3.\n\nD) s \u2192 l=0.\n\nBut earlier, when considering orbital angular momentum conservation, the initial L was 0. So the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN system (L') and the emitted particle (l) must be 0. So L' + l = 0 \u2192 L' = -l. But L' and l are non-negative integers, so the only possibility is L' = l =0. So any emitted particle with l>0 would require L' = -l, which is impossible.\n\nSo the only allowed emission is when l=0 \u2192 s-wave. So options A, B, C emit particles with l>0 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nThus, the correct answer is any of A, B, or C. But the options are four, and the question is which one is not permitted.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as which partial wave is not permitted. So the forbidden ones are A, B, C, and D is allowed.\n\nBut the options are four, and the question gives four options, each with a different emitted particle. So the correct answer is any of the options except D. But the question asks which is not permitted, so all except D are not permitted.\n\nBut the options are four, and the question is to choose one. So perhaps the correct answer is option C. But I'm a bit confused because the reasoning suggests that all except D are forbidden.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the options where L' is even. Because earlier, I concluded that L' must be odd. So any option where L' is even is forbidden.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: L'=2 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption B: L'=0 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption C: L'=2 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption D: L'=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 allowed.\n\nSo the forbidden options are A, B, C. So the correct answer is any of them. But the question asks which is not permitted, so it's either A, B, or C.\n\nBut the options are four, and the question is to choose one. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l must be such that the total orbital angular momentum of the system (L') and the emitted particle (l) sum to the initial L=0. So L' + l =0 \u2192 L' = -l. But since L' and l are non-negative, the only possibility is L'=0 and l=0.\n\nThus, the emitted particle must have l=0 (s-wave). So any option where the emitted particle has l>0 is forbidden.\n\nSo looking at the options:\n\nA) p \u2192 l=1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nB) p \u2192 l=1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nC) f \u2192 l=3 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nD) s \u2192 l=0 \u2192 allowed.\n\nSo the forbidden options are A, B, C. So the correct answer is any of them. But the question is which is not permitted, so the correct answer is the one that is not D.\n\nBut the question gives four options, and the correct one is the one that is not allowed. So the answer would be the one that doesn't meet the parity condition, angular momentum condition, etc.\n\nWait, but let's think about the parity for each option:\n\nOption A: L'=2 \u2192 parity of NN is +1. X has parity -1. So product is -1. Initial parity was +1 \u2192 parity not conserved. So forbidden.\n\nOption B: L'=0 \u2192 parity of NN is +1. X parity -1 \u2192 product -1. Not conserved. Forbidden.\n\nOption C: L'=2 \u2192 parity of NN is +1. X parity -1 \u2192 product -1. Not conserved. Forbidden.\n\nOption D: L'=1 \u2192 parity of NN is -1. X parity -1 \u2192 product +1. Conserved. Allowed.\n\nSo all except D are forbidden. Thus, the answer is any of A, B, C. But the question is which is not permitted, so the correct answer is any of them. But the options are four, and the question expects a single choice.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to determine which option violates both the angular momentum and parity conditions. Let's go through each option.\n\nOption A: 7D1 + p.\n\n- L'=2 (even) \u2192 violates L' must be odd \u2192 forbidden.\n\n- J'=1 \u2192 requires j=-1 \u2192 impossible \u2192 forbidden.\n\n- Parity: L'=2 \u2192 parity +1. X parity -1 \u2192 product -1. Doesn't match initial +1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nSo option A is forbidden.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p.\n\n- L'=0 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\n- J'=1 \u2192 j=-1 \u2192 impossible \u2192 forbidden.\n\n- Parity: L'=0 \u2192 +1. X parity -1 \u2192 product -1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption B forbidden.\n\nOption C: 3D3 + f.\n\n- L'=2 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\n- J'=3 \u2192 j=-3 \u2192 impossible \u2192 forbidden.\n\n- Parity: L'=2 \u2192 +1. X parity -1 \u2192 product -1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption C forbidden.\n\nOption D: 3P0 + s.\n\n- L'=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 allowed.\n\n- J'=0 \u2192 j=0 \u2192 allowed.\n\n- Parity: L'=1 \u2192 -1. X parity -1 \u2192 product +1 \u2192 allowed.\n\nThus, option D is allowed, others are forbidden.\n\nSo the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the correct answer is any of A, B, C. But the options are four, and the question expects one answer. So the answer is the one that is not D.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as four, and the question is to choose which one is not permitted. So the correct answer is any of A, B, or C.\n\nBut the options are four, and the correct answer is the one that doesn't meet the conditions. So among the options, the correct answer is either A, B, or C.\n\nWait, looking back, the question says \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted\", and the options are labeled A-D.\n\nSo the correct answer must be one of them. From the analysis, all except D are forbidden. So the answer is either A, B, or C.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA) 1S0 \u21927D1 + p\n\nB) \u21923S1 + p\n\nC) \u21923D3 + f\n\nD) \u21923P0 + s\n\nSo the allowed option is D. Thus, the forbidden are A, B, C.\n\nBut the question is which is not permitted, so the correct answer is any of them.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the parity and angular momentum conditions again.\n\nThe initial state has parity +1. The final state must have parity (parity of NN) * (parity of X) = +1.\n\nParity of NN is (-1)^L' \u2192 must be -1 (so L' is odd).\n\nParity of X is -1.\n\nSo (-1)^L' * (-1) = +1 \u2192 (-1)^(L' +1) = +1 \u2192 L' +1 must be even \u2192 L' is odd.\n\nSo L' is odd.\n\nNow, looking at the options, which have L' as part of their term symbols.\n\nOption A:7D1 \u2192 L'=2 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption B:3S1 \u2192 L'=0 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption C:3D3 \u2192 L'=2 \u2192 even \u2192 forbidden.\n\nOption D:3P0 \u2192 L'=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 allowed.\n\nThus, options A, B, C are forbidden because L' is even. Only D is allowed.\n\nSo the answer is any of A, B, C.\n\nBut the question asks which is not permitted. So the correct answer is the one that doesn't meet the condition.\n\nSo the answer is option C, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, all A, B, C are forbidden.\n\nWait, the question is to choose which is not permitted, so the correct answer is any of A, B, or C.\n\nBut the options are four, and the question expects one letter. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but I'm not confident. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l must be such that the total angular momentum is conserved.\n\nThe initial J is 0.\n\nThe final J' (NN) plus j (X) must sum to 0.\n\nSo J' + j = 0 \u2192 J' = j.\n\nBut J' and j are non-negative, so the only solution is J' = j = 0.\n\nSo the emitted particle must have j=0. Which means it's an s-wave (l=0).\n\nSo any option where the emitted particle has l>0 is forbidden.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) p \u2192 l=1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nB) p \u2192 l=1 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nC) f \u2192 l=3 \u2192 forbidden.\n\nD) s \u2192 l=0 \u2192 allowed.\n\nThus, options A, B, C are forbidden.\n\nSo the answer is any of A, B, C.\n\nBut the question gives four options, and the correct answer is one of them.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because its emitted particle is f (l=3), which is higher, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C because when you add L' and l, L' + l must be zero.\n\nWait, no, earlier reasoning suggests that the sum of L' and l must be zero, which is only possible if both are zero.\n\nThus, the only allowed option is D.\n\nSo the forbidden options are A, B, C.\n\nThus, the answer is any of them. But the question is to choose one.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because it has the highest l, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the option where L' is even and J' is not zero.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis, the only allowed option is D, so the others are forbidden. Thus, the correct answer is any of A, B, C. But since the question expects a single answer, perhaps the correct option is option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state (S=0, L=0, J=0) emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state has T=0, and the Pauli condition requires that T = S + L + 1 (mod 2). This implies that S and L must have opposite parity for the final state. Additionally, parity conservation requires that the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of X matches the initial parity of +1. Since X has parity -1, the final NN state must have parity -1, which means its orbital angular momentum L' must be odd.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: The NN system starts in a 1S0 state with S=0, L=0, and J=0.\n2. **Final State Constraints**:\n   - The final NN state must have T=0, which requires S' + L' \u2261 1 (mod 2). Since S'=0 (emitting a spin-0 particle), L' must be odd.\n   - Parity conservation: The parity of the final NN state is (-1)^{L'}, and since X has parity -1, the product (-1)^{L'} \u00d7 (-1) must equal the initial parity of +1. This confirms that L' must be odd.\n   - Angular momentum conservation: The total angular momentum J_initial = 0 must equal the sum of the final NN system's angular momentum J' and the emitted particle's angular momentum j. This implies J' = j = 0 for the emitted particle.\n\n3. **Emission of Particle X**:\n   - The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. Its orbital angular momentum l determines the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission. Since the initial orbital angular momentum L=0, the final orbital angular momentum of the NN system (L') and the orbital angular momentum of X (l) must satisfy L' + l = 0. This is only possible if L' = l = 0, meaning X must be emitted in an s-wave (l=0).\n\n### Evaluation of Options:\n- **Option A**: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p  \n  - Final NN state: L'=2 (even), which violates the requirement that L' must be odd.  \n  - Forbidden.\n\n- **Option B**: 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p  \n  - Final NN state: L'=0 (even), which violates the requirement that L' must be odd.  \n  - Forbidden.\n\n- **Option C**: 1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f  \n  - Final NN state: L'=2 (even), which violates the requirement that L' must be odd.  \n  - Forbidden.\n\n- **Option D**: 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s  \n  - Final NN state: L'=1 (odd), satisfying the parity and angular momentum conditions.  \n  - Emitted particle: s-wave (l=0), satisfying angular momentum conservation.  \n  - Allowed.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only allowed option is D. The other options (A, B, and C) are forbidden because they violate the parity and angular momentum conservation conditions.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nThe question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli exclusion principle is involved here, requiring that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, Pauli statistics usually relate to identical particles and their quantum numbers. But in this case, the problem says that for the final NN state, T(NN) must equal S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 modulo 2. So that's an equation I need to keep in mind.\n\nThe final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So that's the isospin part. So I need to find out what the possible quantum numbers are for the emitted particle X, considering both angular momentum and parity conservation.\n\nThe options are A to D, each showing a transition from the initial 1S0 state to some other state plus a particle (like p, s, etc.). I think the letters p, s, f, d, etc., denote the orbital angular momentum quantum number l. Like s is l=0, p is l=1, d is l=2, f is l=3, etc.\n\nSo for each option, the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 would mean 2S+1 =1 \u2192 S=0. So the spin is zero. L is S, which is 0, so the orbital angular momentum is zero. Then J is 0, because J = L + S, but since S is zero, J is 0. So the initial state is S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWhen they emit a particle X, the final state of the NN system will have certain quantum numbers, and X will carry some quantum numbers as well. The system must conserve angular momentum and parity.\n\nLet me think about the parity first. The initial state has parity. For a two-nucleon system, the parity is given by (-1)^L * parity of each nucleon. But wait, each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a certain parity. Wait, but for two identical particles, the total parity is product of their intrinsic parities times (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, the parity of the NN system is (-1)^L multiplied by the product of the intrinsic parities of the two nucleons. But for nucleons, like protons and neutrons, their intrinsic parity is positive, I think. So the initial parity would be (-1)^0 * (+1)*(+1) = +1.\n\nWait, but the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0. So parity is (+1) as I thought.\n\nNow, when they emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1, the parity of the final state must satisfy conservation. So the parity of the initial state is the same as the parity of the final state times the parity of X, right? Because the emitted particle's parity is intrinsic, and the orbital angular momentum of X would affect the parity as well.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The total parity is the product of the intrinsic parity of each particle and the parity from their orbital angular momentum. But in this case, when two nucleons emit a particle X, the system becomes two nucleons (now in a new state) and X. So the total parity is the product of the parity of the NN system, the parity of X, and the orbital angular momentum part.\n\nAlternatively, the parity of the entire system (initial) must equal the parity of the final system. So the initial parity is +1, as we said. The final system is the two nucleons in some state and X.\n\nWait, but in this case, the problem says that the NN system emits X. So the initial system is just the two nucleons, and the final system is two nucleons plus X. But I think that the parity of the final system must equal the parity of the initial system times the parity of the emitted particle X, but considering the orbital angular momentum involved in the emission.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the reaction: NN \u2192 NN + X.\n\nBut the parity of the initial state is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial * (intrinsic parity of NN). But wait, for two nucleons, the intrinsic parity is (+1) each. So the parity of the initial state is (-1)^0 * (+1)^2 = +1.\n\nThe final state has the two nucleons in some state with parity P_final = (-1)^{L_final} * (intrinsic parity of NN). So that's (-1)^{L_final} * (+1)^2 = (-1)^{L_final}.\n\nAdditionally, the particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. So when it's emitted, the parity of X is (-1)^{l_X} * (-1), where l_X is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of X. Because the parity from orbital angular momentum is (-1)^l, and the intrinsic parity is given as -1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the total parity of X is the product of its intrinsic parity and (-1)^{l_X}, where l_X is the orbital angular momentum between the NN system and X. Because when X is emitted, it has some orbital angular momentum l_X with the remaining system.\n\nSo the parity conservation would imply that:\n\nP_initial = P_final_system * P_X.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is the NN system with P_initial = +1.\n\nThe final state is the NN system (with parity P_NN = (-1)^{L_NN}) and X (with parity (-1)^{l_X} * (-1)). So the total parity of the final state is P_NN * P_X. But since the total parity must be conserved, we have:\n\n+1 = [(-1)^{L_NN}] * [(-1)^{l_X} * (-1)].\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\n1 = (-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1}.\n\nWhich implies that (-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1} = 1 \u2192 L_NN + l_X + 1 must be even.\n\nSo L_NN + l_X +1 \u2261 0 mod 2 \u2192 L_NN + l_X \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nThat's one condition.\n\nNow, the angular momentum part. The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state has J_initial = 0. The final state has the NN system with J_final and the X with j_X, so the total must be J_final + j_X must be equal to J_initial, which is 0. So the total angular momentum of the final system must be zero. So J_final and j_X must combine to zero. So J_final = j_X = 0? No, because angular momentum is vectorial. Wait, no, that's not right. The sum of their angular momenta must equal zero, so J_final and j_X must combine to zero. But since J_initial is zero, the total J_final + j_X must be zero. So J_final and j_X must be such that their vector sum is zero. That implies that J_final and j_X are the same in magnitude and opposite in direction. So perhaps J_final = j_X. But wait, J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, and j_X is the total angular momentum of the emitted particle X.\n\nWait, but J_final = L_NN + S_NN, where S_NN is the spin of the NN system. Hmm, but the spin part depends on whether the nucleons are in a symmetric or antisymmetric spin state. Wait, but in the initial state, the NN system is in a 1S0 state, which is S=0. So the spin is zero. After emission, the NN system may have a different spin.\n\nWait, but the initial state's spin is zero. The final state's spin could be different. But considering angular momentum conservation, the sum of the final NN's J and X's j must equal the initial J, which is zero. So J_NN + j_X = 0. But angular momentum is a vector, so the only way this sum can be zero is if J_NN = j_X. But that's only possible if J_NN = j_X = 0. Because if they have the same magnitude but opposite directions, but since both are non-negative scalars, the only possibility is that both are zero. Wait, but that's not correct because angular momentum can have different components, but the vector sum must be zero. Alternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum is zero, so J_NN and j_X must be zero each. Because if you have J_NN and j_X, their sum must be zero, which would require that J_NN = j_X. But since J and j are non-negative, the only way for their vector sum to be zero is if both are zero. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the initial and final states in terms of their angular momentum quantum numbers. The initial state has J_initial = 0, so the total angular momentum is zero. The final state is the NN system plus the X particle. The total angular momentum of the final state is J_NN + j_X. But since J_initial is zero, J_NN + j_X must also be zero. So J_NN + j_X = 0, but since both J_NN and j_X are non-negative, the only solution is J_NN = j_X = 0. So both must have zero angular momentum. But wait, that can't be right because X is being emitted with some orbital angular momentum. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the orbital angular momentum between the NN system and the X. So when the X is emitted, it's moving away with some orbital angular momentum l. So the orbital angular momentum of the X is l, which contributes to the total angular momentum. So perhaps the total angular momentum of the final state is J_NN + j_X + L_orbital. Wait, no, that might complicate things. Alternatively, the orbital angular momentum of the X is part of the system. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's think differently.\n\nThe initial state has J_initial = 0. The final state consists of the NN system and X. The total angular momentum must still be zero. So the sum of the angular momenta of the NN system and X must be zero. So J_NN and j_X must be zero? Or perhaps their vector sum is zero. But since J and j are scalar quantum numbers, the only way their sum can be zero is if both are zero. So J_NN = j_X = 0.\n\nBut wait, X is a particle emitted with some orbital angular momentum. So the orbital angular momentum of X is l, which contributes to j_X. So j_X is the total angular momentum of X, which includes its spin and orbital angular momentum. But wait, the problem says that X has intrinsic parity -1. The parity of X is (-1)^{l} * (-1), as we discussed earlier. So the parity condition is covered, but the angular momentum condition requires that the total J of the final state is zero. So J_NN must equal j_X, but in opposite directions. Wait, but J_NN and j_X are both non-negative, so that can't happen unless both are zero. So maybe that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the angular momentum quantum numbers. Let's denote the orbital angular momentum of X as l. So the angular momentum j_X of X would be j_X = l + s_X, where s_X is the spin of X. But wait, the spin of X isn't given. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's take a step back.\n\nThe problem says that the emitted particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The options give the possible transitions, each ending with a particle (like p, s, etc.) which I think denotes the orbital angular momentum quantum number l of X. For example, option A says 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p. So the X has l=1, because p denotes l=1. Similarly, option B: 3S1 + p \u2192 l=1. Option C: 3D3 + f \u2192 f is l=3. Option D: 3P0 + s \u2192 s is l=0.\n\nSo for each option, the orbital angular momentum l_X is given by the letter after the NN state. So in each case, l_X is known.\n\nSo for each option, I can compute the parity condition and the angular momentum condition.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0, which is (2S+1)L(J) = 1 S 0. So S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nThe final NN state is 7D1. Let's parse that. 7D1 \u2192 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3. L is D, which is 2. J is 1.\n\nSo for the final NN state, S=3, L=2, J=1.\n\nSo the Pauli condition is T(NN) = S + L +1 mod 2. Wait, the problem says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T = S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nIn the final state, T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L = 1 mod 2.\n\nIn this option, S=3, L=2. So 3 + 2 =5 \u2192 5 mod 2 is 1. So 0 = 1 mod 2? No, that's 1=0? Which is not correct. So this state would have T= (3+2+1) mod2 = (6 mod2)=0. Wait, wait, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2. So 0 =3 +2 +1 mod2 \u2192 6 mod2 is 0. So yes, 0=0. So the Pauli condition is satisfied. So this option is possible.\n\nNow, parity. The initial parity is +1. The final parity is (-1)^L_final * (intrinsic parity of NN) \u2192 (-1)^2 * (+1) = +1.\n\nThe X has l_X=p \u2192 l=1. So X's parity is (-1)^1 * (-1) = (-1) * (-1) = +1. Wait, no, the intrinsic parity of X is -1. So the parity of X is (-1)^l_X * (-1). So for l_X=1, that's (-1)^1 * (-1) = (-1) * (-1) = +1.\n\nSo the parity of the final state is (NN's parity) * (X's parity) = (+1) * (+1) = +1. But initial parity is +1, so parity is conserved. So parity is conserved in this option.\n\nNow, the angular momentum part. The initial J is 0. The final J of NN is 1. The X has j_X which is l_X + s_X. Wait, but I don't know s_X. Alternatively, maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is l_X, which is 1, but that's part of the angular momentum. Hmm, perhaps the total angular momentum should be zero, so the sum of the NN's J and X's j must be zero. But in this case, the NN's J is 1, and X's j would be l_X + s_X. But without knowing s_X, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the system, so the total angular momentum is J_NN + j_X + L_orbital. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think in terms of the possible angular momentum coupling.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l_X, so the total angular momentum of the system is J_NN + j_X. But I'm not certain. Maybe I should just proceed with the other conditions and see which options are allowed or not.\n\nOption B: 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p.\n\nFinal NN state is 3S1. So S=1 (since 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1), L=0 (S state), J=1.\n\nPauli condition: T=0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 1 + 0 +1=2 \u2192 0 mod2. So condition holds.\n\nParity: NN's parity is (-1)^0 = +1. X has l=1 (p), so X's parity is (-1)^1 * (-1) = (+1). So total parity: (+1) * (+1) = +1 \u2192 matches initial.\n\nSo parity is conserved.\n\nNow, angular momentum. Initial J=0. Final NN J=1. X's j is l + s. But without knowing s, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the system, so the total J of the system is J_NN + j_X. But since initial J=0, J_NN + j_X must be zero. So J_NN = -j_X. But since J and j are non-negative, this would require both to be zero. But in this case, J_NN is 1, which can't be. So this might not be allowed. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum is J_NN + j_X = 0. So J_NN must equal j_X, but since they are non-negative, both must be zero. But here, J_NN is 1 and j_X is at least l=1 (if spin is zero), so j_X would be 1. Then J_NN + j_X = 2, which doesn't equal zero. So this would not conserve angular momentum. So option B might be forbidden.\n\nWait, but the initial J is zero, so the final total J must also be zero. So J_NN + j_X must be zero. The only way this can happen is if both J_NN and j_X are zero. But in this case, J_NN is 1 and j_X would be at least 1, so their sum can't be zero. So option B is not allowed. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing something about the orbital angular momentum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the system, so the total angular momentum is J_NN + j_X + L_orbital. But that's getting too complicated. Maybe I should proceed to the other options and see.\n\nOption C: 1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f.\n\nFinal NN state is 3D3 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is D \u2192 2. J=3.\n\nPauli condition: T=0 =1 +2 +1 mod2 \u2192 4 mod2=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nParity: NN's parity is (-1)^2 = +1. X has l=3 (f), so X's parity is (-1)^3 * (-1) = (-1)*(-1)= +1. So total parity is (+1) * (+1) = +1 \u2192 matches initial.\n\nSo parity is conserved.\n\nAngular momentum: J_initial=0. Final J_NN=3. X's j would be l=3 + s. Without knowing s, it's hard, but assuming s is zero (maybe X is a pseudoscalar?), j_X=3. So J_NN + j_X =3+3=6 \u2192 which doesn't equal zero. So angular momentum isn't conserved. Thus, this option is not allowed.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is l_X, which contributes to the total angular momentum. So the total angular momentum of the system is J_NN + j_X + L_X, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum of X. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the system, so the total angular momentum is J_NN + j_X. But I'm not confident.\n\nOption D: 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s.\n\nFinal NN state is 3P0. So 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is P \u2192 1. J=0.\n\nPauli condition: T=0 =1 +1 +1 mod2 \u2192 3 mod2=1 \u2192 0=1? No. So this condition is not satisfied. So the final state would have T= (1+1+1) mod2= 3 mod2=1. But the problem states that T=0. So this option is not allowed. So this option is forbidden.\n\nWait, but wait, the Pauli condition is T= S + L +1 mod2. So for this option, S=1, L=1. So 1+1+1=3 mod2=1. So T=1, which doesn't match the given T=0. So this option is not allowed.\n\nSo looking back at the options, which one is not permitted.\n\nWait, the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So we have to find which option violates either the angular momentum or parity conservation, or the Pauli condition.\n\nSo let's reevaluate each option:\n\nOption A: Pauli condition holds, parity holds. Angular momentum: J_NN=1, j_X=1 (assuming s=0). So J_NN + j_X = 2. But initial J=0. So this seems like angular momentum isn't conserved, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the system, so the total angular momentum is J_NN + j_X + l_X. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum l_X is part of the system, so the total angular momentum is J_NN + j_X + l_X. But that doesn't make sense because j_X already includes the spin and orbital angular momentum of X. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider that for each option, the parity condition is satisfied, and the Pauli condition is satisfied, but the angular momentum isn't. So the option that doesn't satisfy angular momentum conservation is the answer.\n\nLooking at option D: The Pauli condition is not satisfied, so that's invalid. So D is not allowed.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the final state has T=0. So any option where T doesn't equal zero is invalid. So let me recheck the Pauli condition for each option.\n\nOption A: S=3, L=2. T=3+2+1=6 mod2=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption B: S=1, L=0. T=1+0+1=2 mod2=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption C: S=1, L=2. T=1+2+1=4 mod2=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption D: S=1, L=1. T=1+1+1=3 mod2=1 \u2192 no. So D's Pauli condition is violated. So D is invalid. So the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted, which would be D.\n\nBut wait, the question says which partial wave is not permitted. So the forbidden option is D.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in option B, the Pauli condition is satisfied, but angular momentum isn't. So in that case, option B would be forbidden.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the angular momentum condition.\n\nThe initial state has J_initial =0.\n\nThe final state consists of the NN system with J_final and the X particle with j_X. The total angular momentum J_total = J_final + j_X must be zero. So J_final and j_X must combine to zero. That can only happen if J_final = j_X =0. Because if J_final and j_X are non-zero, their vector sum can't be zero unless they are equal and opposite, which isn't possible with non-negative scalars. So the only possibility is J_final=0 and j_X=0.\n\nSo for each option, we must have J_final=0 and j_X=0.\n\nLooking at each option:\n\nOption A: Final NN J=1 \u2192 so J_final=1 \u22600 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption B: Final J=1 \u2192 same problem. Invalid.\n\nOption C: Final J=3 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: Final J=0 \u2192 this is valid. Now, j_X must be zero. So X's j must be zero. j_X = l_X + s_X. Assuming s_X is zero (like a photon, but X is a particle with intrinsic parity -1, perhaps a pion?), then j_X = l_X. So for j_X=0, l_X must be zero.\n\nIn option D, X is s, which is l=0. So j_X=0 (assuming s=0). So J_final=0 and j_X=0 \u2192 J_total=0. So this is allowed.\n\nSo the only option that satisfies both J_final=0 and j_X=0 is option D.\n\nWait, but the problem says the final state has T=0, and in option D, the Pauli condition is not satisfied, as T would be 1. So option D is invalid because T=1, which doesn't match the given T=0.\n\nSo the forbidden option is D.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that D's Pauli condition was not satisfied, so it's invalid. So why is the question asking which partial wave is not permitted? Because in option D, the Pauli condition is not met, so the state is forbidden. So the answer would be option D.\n\nBut wait, the question says that the final state has T=0. So any option where the Pauli condition isn't satisfied is forbidden. So looking at the options, only option D fails the Pauli condition. So the partial wave in option D is forbidden.\n\nWait, but let me re-express the Pauli condition. The problem states: Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2.\n\nSo for the final state:\n\nT = S + L +1 mod2.\n\nIn option D: S=1, L=1 \u2192 T=1+1+1=3 mod2=1. But the problem says T=0. So this is invalid.\n\nSo option D is forbidden.\n\nBut the options are about the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum. So the forbidden partial wave would be the one that doesn't meet the conditions.\n\nSo the answer is option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nThe question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli exclusion principle is involved here, requiring that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, Pauli statistics usually relate to identical particles and their quantum numbers. But in this case, the problem says that for the final NN state, T(NN) must equal S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 modulo 2. So that's an equation I need to keep in mind.\n\nThe final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So that's the isospin part. So I need to find out what the possible quantum numbers are for the emitted particle X, considering both angular momentum and parity conservation.\n\nThe options are A to D, each showing a transition from the initial 1S0 state to some other state plus a particle (like p, s, etc.). I think the letters p, s, f, d, etc., denote the orbital angular momentum quantum number l. Like s is l=0, p is l=1, d is l=2, f is l=3, etc.\n\nSo for each option, the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 would mean 2S+1 =1 \u2192 S=0. So the spin is zero. L is S, which is 0, so the orbital angular momentum is zero. Then J is 0, because J = L + S, but since S is zero, J is 0. So the initial state is S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWhen they emit a particle X, the final state of the NN system will have certain quantum numbers, and X will carry some quantum numbers as well. The system must conserve angular momentum and parity.\n\nLet me think about the parity first. The initial state has parity. For a two-nucleon system, the parity is given by (-1)^L * parity of each nucleon. But wait, each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a certain parity. Wait, but for two identical particles, the total parity is product of their intrinsic parities times (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, the parity of the NN system is (-1)^L multiplied by the product of the intrinsic parities of the two nucleons. But for nucleons, like protons and neutrons, their intrinsic parity is positive, I think. So the initial parity would be (-1)^0 * (+1)*(+1) = +1.\n\nWait, but the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0. So parity is (+1) as I thought.\n\nNow, when they emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1, the parity of the final state must satisfy conservation. So the parity of the initial state is the same as the parity of the final state times the parity of X, right? Because the emitted particle's parity is intrinsic, and the orbital angular momentum of X would affect the parity as well.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The total parity is the product of the intrinsic parity of each particle and the parity from their orbital angular momentum. But in this case, when two nucleons emit a particle X, the system becomes two nucleons (now in a new state) and X. So the total parity is the product of the parity of the NN system, the parity of X, and the orbital angular momentum part.\n\nAlternatively, the parity of the entire system (initial) must equal the parity of the final system. So the initial parity is +1, as we said. The final system is the two nucleons in some state and X.\n\nWait, but in this case, the problem says that the NN system emits X. So the initial system is just the two nucleons, and the final system is two nucleons plus X. But I think that the parity of the final system must equal the parity of the initial system times the parity of the emitted particle X, but considering the orbital angular momentum involved in the emission.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the reaction: NN \u2192 NN + X.\n\nBut the parity of the initial state is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial * (intrinsic parity of NN). But wait, for two nucleons, the intrinsic parity is (+1) each. So the parity of the initial state is (-1)^0 * (+1)^2 = +1.\n\nThe final state has the two nucleons in some state with parity P_final = (-1)^{L_final} * (intrinsic parity of NN). So that's (-1)^{L_final} * (+1)^2 = (-1)^{L_final}.\n\nAdditionally, the particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. So when it's emitted, the parity of X is (-1)^{l_X} * (-1), where l_X is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of X. Because the parity from orbital angular momentum is (-1)^l, and the intrinsic parity is given as -1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the total parity of X is the product of its intrinsic parity and (-1)^{l_X}, where l_X is the orbital angular momentum between the NN system and X. Because when X is emitted, it has some orbital angular momentum l_X with the remaining system.\n\nSo the parity conservation would imply that:\n\nP_initial = P_final_system * P_X.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is the NN system with P_initial = +1.\n\nThe final state is the NN system (with parity P_NN = (-1)^{L_NN}) and X (with parity (-1)^{l_X} * (-1)). So the total parity of the final state is P_NN * P_X. But since the total parity must be conserved, we have:\n\n+1 = [(-1)^{L_NN}] * [(-1)^{l_X} * (-1)].\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\n1 = (-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1}.\n\nWhich implies that (-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1} = 1 \u2192 L_NN + l_X + 1 must be even.\n\nSo L_NN + l_X +1 \u2261 0 mod 2 \u2192 L_NN + l_X \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nThat's one condition.\n\nNow, the angular momentum part. The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state has J_initial = 0. The final state has the NN system with J_final and the X with j_X, so the total must be J_final + j_X must be equal to J_initial, which is 0. So the total angular momentum of the final system must be zero. So J_final and j_X must combine to zero. So J_final = j_X = 0? No, because angular momentum is vectorial. Wait, no, that's not right. The sum of their angular momenta must equal zero, so J_final and j_X must combine to zero. But since J_initial is zero, the total J_final + j_X must be zero. So J_final and j_X must be such that their vector sum is zero. That implies that J_final and j_X are the same in magnitude and opposite in direction. So perhaps J_final = j_X. But wait, J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, and j_X is the total angular momentum of the emitted particle X.\n\nWait, but J_final = L_NN + S_NN, where S_NN is the spin of the NN system. Hmm, but the spin part depends on whether the nucleons are in a symmetric or antisymmetric spin state. Wait, but in the initial state, the NN system is in a 1S0 state, which is S=0. So the spin is zero. After emission, the NN system may have a different spin.\n\nWait, but the initial state's spin is zero. The final state's spin could be different. But considering angular momentum conservation, the sum of the final NN's J and X's j must equal the initial J, which is zero. So J_NN + j_X = 0. But angular momentum is a vector, so the only way this sum can be zero is if J_NN = j_X. But that's only possible if J_NN = j_X = 0. Because if they have the same magnitude but opposite directions, but since both are non-negative scalars, the only possibility is that both are zero. Wait, but that's not correct because angular momentum can have different components, but the vector sum must be zero. Alternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum is zero, so J_NN and j_X must be zero each. Because if you have J_NN and j_X, their sum must be zero, which would require that J_NN = j_X. But since J and j are non-negative, the only way for their vector sum to be zero is if both are zero. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the initial and final states in terms of their angular momentum quantum numbers. The initial state has J_initial = 0, so the total angular momentum is zero. The final state is the NN system plus the X particle. The total angular momentum of the final state is J_NN + j_X. But since J_initial is zero, J_NN + j_X must also be zero. So J_NN + j_X = 0, but since both J_NN and j_X are non-negative, the only solution is J_NN = j_X = 0. So both must have zero angular momentum. But wait, that can't be right because X is being emitted with some orbital angular momentum. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the orbital angular momentum between the NN system and the X. So when the X is emitted, it's moving away with some orbital angular momentum l. So the orbital angular momentum of the X is l, which contributes to the total angular momentum. So perhaps the total angular momentum of the final state is J_NN + j_X + L_orbital. Wait, no, that might complicate things. Alternatively, the orbital angular momentum of the X is part of the system. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's think differently.\n\nThe initial state has J_initial = 0. The final state consists of the NN system and X. The total angular momentum must still be zero. So the sum of the angular momenta of the NN system and X must be zero. So J_NN and j_X must be zero? Or perhaps their vector sum is zero. But since J and j are scalar quantum numbers, the only way their sum can be zero is if both are zero. So J_NN = j_X = 0.\n\nBut wait, X is a particle emitted with some orbital angular momentum. So the orbital angular momentum of X is l, which contributes to j_X. So j_X is the total angular momentum of X, which includes its spin and orbital angular momentum. But wait, the problem says that X has intrinsic parity -1. The parity of X is (-1)^{l} * (-1), as we discussed earlier. So the parity condition is covered, but the angular momentum condition requires that the total J of the final state is zero. So J_NN must equal j_X, but in opposite directions. Wait, but J_NN and j_X are both non-negative, so that can't happen unless both are zero. So maybe that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the angular momentum quantum numbers. Let's denote the orbital angular momentum of X as l. So the angular momentum j_X of X would be j_X = l + s_X, where s_X is the spin of X. But wait, the spin of X isn't given. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's take a step back.\n\nThe problem says that the emitted particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The options give the possible transitions, each ending with a particle (like p, s, etc.) which I think denotes the orbital angular momentum quantum number l of X. For example, option A says 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p. So the X has l=1, because p denotes l=1. Similarly, option B: 3S1 + p \u2192 l=1. Option C: 3D3 + f \u2192 f is l=3. Option D: 3P0 + s \u2192 s is l=0.\n\nSo for each option, the orbital angular momentum l_X is given by the letter after the NN state. So in each case, l_X is known.\n\nSo for each option, I can compute the parity condition and the angular momentum condition.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0, which is (2S+1)L(J) = 1 S 0. So S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nThe final NN state is 7D1. Let's parse that. 7D1 \u2192 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3. L is D, which is 2. J is 1.\n\nSo for the final NN state, S=3, L=2, J=1.\n\nSo the Pauli condition is T(NN) = S + L +1 mod 2. Wait, the problem says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T = S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nIn the final state, T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L = 1 mod 2.\n\nIn this option, S=3, L=2. So 3 + 2 =5 \u2192 5 mod 2 is 1. So 0 = 1 mod 2? No, that's 1=0? Which is not correct. So this state would have T= (3+2+1) mod2 = (6 mod2)=0. Wait, wait, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2. So 0 =3 +2 +1 mod2 \u2192 6 mod2 is 0. So yes, 0=0. So the Pauli condition is satisfied. So this option is possible.\n\nNow, parity. The initial parity is +1. The final parity is (-1)^L_final * (intrinsic parity of NN) \u2192 (-1)^2 * (+1) = +1.\n\nThe X has l_X=p \u2192 l=1. So X's parity is (-1)^1 * (-1) = (-1) * (-1) = +1. Wait, no, the intrinsic parity of X is -1. So the parity of X is (-1)^l_X * (-1). So for l_X=1, that's (-1)^1 * (-1) = (-1) * (-1) = +1.\n\nSo the parity of the final state is (NN's parity) * (X's parity) = (+1) * (+1) = +1. But initial parity is +1, so parity is conserved. So parity is conserved in this option.\n\nNow, the angular momentum part. The initial J is 0. The final J of NN is 1. The X has j_X which is l_X + s_X. Wait, but I don't know s_X. Alternatively, maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is l_X, which is 1, but that's part of the angular momentum. Hmm, perhaps the total angular momentum should be zero, so the sum of the NN's J and X's j must be zero. But in this case, the NN's J is 1, and X's j would be l_X + s_X. But without knowing s_X, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the system, so the total angular momentum is J_NN + j_X + L_orbital. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think in terms of the possible angular momentum coupling.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l_X, so the total angular momentum of the system is J_NN + j_X. But I'm not certain. Maybe I should just proceed with the other conditions and see which options are allowed or not.\n\nOption B: 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p.\n\nFinal NN state is 3S1. So S=1 (since 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1), L=0 (S state), J=1.\n\nPauli condition: T=0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 1 + 0 +1=2 \u2192 0 mod2. So condition holds.\n\nParity: NN's parity is (-1)^0 = +1. X has l=1 (p), so X's parity is (-1)^1 * (-1) = (+1). So total parity: (+1) * (+1) = +1 \u2192 matches initial.\n\nSo parity is conserved.\n\nNow, angular momentum. Initial J=0. Final NN J=1. X's j is l + s. But without knowing s, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the system, so the total J of the system is J_NN + j_X. But since initial J=0, J_NN + j_X must be zero. So J_NN = -j_X. But since J and j are non-negative, this would require both to be zero. But in this case, J_NN is 1, which can't be. So this might not be allowed. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum is J_NN + j_X = 0. So J_NN must equal j_X, but since they are non-negative, both must be zero. But here, J_NN is 1 and j_X is at least l=1 (if spin is zero), so j_X would be 1. Then J_NN + j_X = 2, which doesn't equal zero. So this would not conserve angular momentum. So option B might be forbidden.\n\nWait, but the initial J is zero, so the final total J must also be zero. So J_NN + j_X must be zero. The only way this can happen is if both J_NN and j_X are zero. But in this case, J_NN is 1 and j_X would be at least 1, so their sum can't be zero. So option B is not allowed. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing something about the orbital angular momentum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the system, so the total angular momentum is J_NN + j_X + L_orbital. But that's getting too complicated. Maybe I should proceed to the other options and see.\n\nOption C: 1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f.\n\nFinal NN state is 3D3 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is D \u2192 2. J=3.\n\nPauli condition: T=0 =1 +2 +1 mod2 \u2192 4 mod2=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nParity: NN's parity is (-1)^2 = +1. X has l=3 (f), so X's parity is (-1)^3 * (-1) = (-1)*(-1)= +1. So total parity is (+1) * (+1) = +1 \u2192 matches initial.\n\nSo parity is conserved.\n\nAngular momentum: J_initial=0. Final J_NN=3. X's j would be l=3 + s. Without knowing s, it's hard, but assuming s is zero (maybe X is a pseudoscalar?), j_X=3. So J_NN + j_X =3+3=6 \u2192 which doesn't equal zero. So angular momentum isn't conserved. Thus, this option is not allowed.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is l_X, which contributes to the total angular momentum. So the total angular momentum of the system is J_NN + j_X + L_X, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum of X. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the system, so the total angular momentum is J_NN + j_X. But I'm not confident.\n\nOption D: 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s.\n\nFinal NN state is 3P0. So 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is P \u2192 1. J=0.\n\nPauli condition: T=0 =1 +1 +1 mod2 \u2192 3 mod2=1 \u2192 0=1? No. So this condition is not satisfied. So the final state would have T= (1+1+1) mod2= 3 mod2=1. But the problem states that T=0. So this option is not allowed. So this option is forbidden.\n\nWait, but wait, the Pauli condition is T= S + L +1 mod2. So for this option, S=1, L=1. So 1+1+1=3 mod2=1. So T=1, which doesn't match the given T=0. So this option is not allowed.\n\nSo looking back at the options, which one is not permitted.\n\nWait, the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So we have to find which option violates either the angular momentum or parity conservation, or the Pauli condition.\n\nSo let's reevaluate each option:\n\nOption A: Pauli condition holds, parity holds. Angular momentum: J_NN=1, j_X=1 (assuming s=0). So J_NN + j_X = 2. But initial J=0. So this seems like angular momentum isn't conserved, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the system, so the total angular momentum is J_NN + j_X + l_X. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum l_X is part of the system, so the total angular momentum is J_NN + j_X + l_X. But that doesn't make sense because j_X already includes the spin and orbital angular momentum of X. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider that for each option, the parity condition is satisfied, and the Pauli condition is satisfied, but the angular momentum isn't. So the option that doesn't satisfy angular momentum conservation is the answer.\n\nLooking at option D: The Pauli condition is not satisfied, so that's invalid. So D is not allowed.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the final state has T=0. So any option where T doesn't equal zero is invalid. So let me recheck the Pauli condition for each option.\n\nOption A: S=3, L=2. T=3+2+1=6 mod2=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption B: S=1, L=0. T=1+0+1=2 mod2=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption C: S=1, L=2. T=1+2+1=4 mod2=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nOption D: S=1, L=1. T=1+1+1=3 mod2=1 \u2192 no. So D's Pauli condition is violated. So D is invalid. So the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted, which would be D.\n\nBut wait, the question says which partial wave is not permitted. So the forbidden option is D.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in option B, the Pauli condition is satisfied, but angular momentum isn't. So in that case, option B would be forbidden.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the angular momentum condition.\n\nThe initial state has J_initial =0.\n\nThe final state consists of the NN system with J_final and the X particle with j_X. The total angular momentum J_total = J_final + j_X must be zero. So J_final and j_X must combine to zero. That can only happen if J_final = j_X =0. Because if J_final and j_X are non-zero, their vector sum can't be zero unless they are equal and opposite, which isn't possible with non-negative scalars. So the only possibility is J_final=0 and j_X=0.\n\nSo for each option, we must have J_final=0 and j_X=0.\n\nLooking at each option:\n\nOption A: Final NN J=1 \u2192 so J_final=1 \u22600 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption B: Final J=1 \u2192 same problem. Invalid.\n\nOption C: Final J=3 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: Final J=0 \u2192 this is valid. Now, j_X must be zero. So X's j must be zero. j_X = l_X + s_X. Assuming s_X is zero (like a photon, but X is a particle with intrinsic parity -1, perhaps a pion?), then j_X = l_X. So for j_X=0, l_X must be zero.\n\nIn option D, X is s, which is l=0. So j_X=0 (assuming s=0). So J_final=0 and j_X=0 \u2192 J_total=0. So this is allowed.\n\nSo the only option that satisfies both J_final=0 and j_X=0 is option D.\n\nWait, but the problem says the final state has T=0, and in option D, the Pauli condition is not satisfied, as T would be 1. So option D is invalid because T=1, which doesn't match the given T=0.\n\nSo the forbidden option is D.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that D's Pauli condition was not satisfied, so it's invalid. So why is the question asking which partial wave is not permitted? Because in option D, the Pauli condition is not met, so the state is forbidden. So the answer would be option D.\n\nBut wait, the question says that the final state has T=0. So any option where the Pauli condition isn't satisfied is forbidden. So looking at the options, only option D fails the Pauli condition. So the partial wave in option D is forbidden.\n\nWait, but let me re-express the Pauli condition. The problem states: Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2.\n\nSo for the final state:\n\nT = S + L +1 mod2.\n\nIn option D: S=1, L=1 \u2192 T=1+1+1=3 mod2=1. But the problem says T=0. So this is invalid.\n\nSo option D is forbidden.\n\nBut the options are about the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum. So the forbidden partial wave would be the one that doesn't meet the conditions.\n\nSo the answer is option D.\n\n\nThe problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy \\( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\, (\\text{mod } 2) \\). The final NN state has \\( T(NN) = 0 \\), and the task is to determine which partial wave is not permitted, considering conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State**:  \n   The initial state is \\( 1S0 \\), which corresponds to \\( S = 0 \\), \\( L = 0 \\), and \\( J = 0 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear physics and quantum mechanics. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nThe question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state that emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) equals S(NN) plus L(NN) plus 1 modulo 2. Oh right, T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum.\n\nThe final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to find which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from 1S0 to another state plus a particle.\n\nWait, the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J), right? So for 1S0, the S is 0 because it's S0. So the term symbol would be (2*0+1)L(J) \u2192 1L J. But wait, the initial state is 1S0, which I think means S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me think. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, the S is the total spin of the two nucleons. S=0, so 2S+1=1. L is the orbital angular momentum. Since it's S, that's L=0. So J is the total angular momentum, which would be L + S, but since both are zero, J=0.\n\nSo the initial state is 1S0 \u2192 which is 1S0 with S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nThe particle X is emitted, so the final state is NN plus X. The problem says that the initial state is 1S0, and the options show transitions to other states plus a particle. So for each option, the initial is 1S0, and the final is something like 7D1 plus p, etc.\n\nWait, the question says that the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J), but in the options, the emitted particle is denoted by a lowercase letter, like p, s, f. Oh, I think those denote the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Like, s is l=0, p is l=1, d is l=2, f is l=3, etc.\n\nSo, for each option, the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is something like 7D1. Let me parse that. 7D1: The (2S+1) is 7, so 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3. Then L is D, which is l=2. And J is 1.\n\nWait, but the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. So the two nucleons are in a state with S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWhen they emit a particle X, the total angular momentum and parity must be conserved. Also, the Pauli exclusion principle imposes some condition on the isospin and spin and angular momentum.\n\nThe problem says that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin of the NN system, S is their total spin, L is their orbital angular momentum. So T = S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nIn the final state, the NN has T=0. So substituting into the equation: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nWait, but in the initial state, the NN is in 1S0. So S_initial = 0, L_initial =0. So the initial state has T_initial = 0 + 0 +1 mod 2 \u2192 T_initial =1. But wait, the initial state is 1S0, which is a bound state. But the question says that the NN system emits a particle, so the final state is NN plus X. Wait, no\u2014the initial state is the NN system in 1S0, and they emit X, so the final state is just the NN system? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the system is two nucleons, and they emit a particle X. So the final state is the two nucleons plus X. Or wait, no, the initial state is NN in 1S0, and they emit a particle X, so the final state is the NN plus X. So the NN after emission is in some state, and X is emitted.\n\nBut the problem statement says: \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0.\" So the NN after emission have T=0. So the initial NN had T=1, because T_initial = S_initial + L_initial +1 mod 2. S_initial is 0 (from 1S0), L_initial is 0, so T_initial = 0 +0 +1 =1 mod 2.\n\nSo the NN system's isospin goes from 1 to 0. Hmm, but that's a change. But isospin is a conserved quantity in strong interactions, but maybe the problem is considering that the emission of X is via a strong interaction, so isospin should be conserved. Wait, but the problem says the particle X is emitted, so perhaps the initial state has isospin T=1, and the final state's NN has T=0. That would imply that isospin isn't conserved, but perhaps the problem allows for that because X has some isospin as well.\n\nWait, but the problem is about parity and angular momentum conservation. Hmm.\n\nSo the process is NN in 1S0 \u2192 emits X, becoming NN' plus X. The NN' has T=0. So, the initial isospin is T_initial =1, and the final is T_NN' =0, and X has its own isospin. But perhaps isospin conservation isn't the main issue here, but the problem gives a condition on the final state's isospin, T=0.\n\nBut the main points are about angular momentum and parity.\n\nSo the initial state is 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0. The emitted particle X has some orbital angular momentum l (like p is l=1, s is l=0, d is l=2, f is l=3). So the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital part of the NN's state after emission is L'.\n\nWait, but the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial J is 0. The final state's angular momentum is the sum of the NN's J' and X's orbital angular momentum l, but I think it's more complicated. Alternatively, the process involves the NN system and X, so the total angular momentum must be conserved.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the process is the NN emitting X. So the initial state is J=0, and the final state is the NN in state with J' plus X's orbital angular momentum l.\n\nWait, but in reality, the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the total system. So the total angular momentum after emission is J' (of NN) plus l (of X), but also considering their relative orbital angular momentum.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think in terms of adding the angular momenta.\n\nWait, the initial state has J=0. So the total angular momentum after emission must also be 0. So J' (NN's) and l (X's) must combine to 0. But wait, that's only if X is a boson, but in reality, X could be any particle. Alternatively, the initial total angular momentum is zero, so the final must have total angular momentum zero.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model this as the NN system in some state and the emitted particle in some state. So the initial state is J_initial =0. The final state is the NN' with J' and the X with l (orbital angular momentum). So J_initial = J_final. So J' (NN') plus l (X) must sum to J_initial =0.\n\nWait, but J' and l are vectors, so their vector sum must be zero. So J' = -l. So J' must have the same magnitude as l, but opposite direction. So |J'| = l.\n\nBut the possible values of J' and l must allow for their vector sum to be zero. So J' must equal l, but in opposite direction. But since angular momentum is quantized, this would require that J' and l have the same magnitude. So l must equal J'.\n\nWait, but J' is the total angular momentum of the NN', which is the sum of their spin (S') and orbital angular momentum (L'). So J' = S' + L'.\n\nWait, but the NN' system has spin S' and orbital L', so J' = S' + L'.\n\nWait, but the initial state is S=0, L=0, so J=0. The emitted X carries away some orbital angular momentum, but the NN' system's L' would be determined by the process.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think in terms of conservation of parity.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by (-1)^L_initial. Since L_initial is 0, parity is 1.\n\nThe parity of the final state must also be 1 because parity is conserved in strong interactions (assuming X is a boson emitted via strong force). Wait, but the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. Hmm, but parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The parity of the final state would be the product of the parities of the NN' state and X's intrinsic parity, multiplied by (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X.\n\nWait, the parity of the final state (NN' + X) would be parity_NN' * parity_X * (-1)^l.\n\nSince parity is conserved, parity_initial = parity_final.\n\nParity_initial is (-1)^L_initial. L_initial is 0, so parity_initial =1.\n\nParity_final = parity_NN' * parity_X * (-1)^l.\n\nSo 1 = parity_NN' * (-1) * (-1)^l.\n\nBecause X has intrinsic parity -1.\n\nSo 1 = (-1) * (-1)^l * parity_NN'.\n\nLet me rearrange that:\n\nparity_NN' = [1] / [ (-1) * (-1)^l ] = [ (-1)^{-l-1} ].\n\nSo parity_NN' = (-1)^{-l-1} = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nBut the parity of the NN' state is determined by their orbital angular momentum L' as (-1)^L'.\n\nSo (-1)^L' = (-1)^{l+1} \u2192 L' = l +1 mod 2.\n\nSo L' must have the same parity as l+1.\n\nBut wait, L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system. So L' must be an integer, but its parity is determined by the equation above.\n\nSo for each option, we can compute l (from the emitted particle) and then determine what L' must be.\n\nThe options:\n\nA) 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p\nB) 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p\nC) 1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f\nD) 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s\n\nWait, in each case, the emitted particle is denoted by a letter. So in option A, it's p, which is l=1. In option B, p again, so l=1. C has f, which is l=3. D has s, which is l=0.\n\nSo for each option, l is:\n\nA) l=1\nB) l=1\nC) l=3\nD) l=0\n\nNow, for each case, compute L' must be l+1 mod 2.\n\nSo:\n\nA) l=1 \u2192 L' must be even (since 1+1=2 \u2192 even)\nB) l=1 \u2192 same as A: L' even\nC) l=3 \u2192 3+1=4 \u2192 even \u2192 L' even\nD) l=0 \u2192 0+1=1 \u2192 L' must be odd.\n\nWait, but wait, L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system. So L' must be an integer, but the parity (even or odd) is determined by l.\n\nSo for each option:\n\nA) l=1 \u2192 L' must be even (L' =0,2,4,...)\nB) same as A\nC) l=3 \u2192 L' even\nD) l=0 \u2192 L' must be odd (1,3,5...)\n\nNow, the NN' state after emission has a certain spin and orbital angular momentum. The Pauli condition says T = S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nIn the final state, T=0. So 0 = S' + L' +1 mod 2 \u2192 S' + L' = 1 mod 2.\n\nSo S' = 1 - L' mod 2.\n\nSo, for each option, let's see if the final state's S' and L' satisfy this.\n\nBut wait, the options give the final state of the NN' as, for example, 7D1. Let me parse that.\n\nThe term symbol is (2S'+1)L'(J'). So for each option:\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 (2S'+1)=7 \u2192 S'=3. L' is D, which is l=2. J' is 1.\n\nSo S'=3, L'=2.\n\nCheck Pauli condition: T = S' + L' +1 mod 2. T=0.\n\n0 \u2261 3 +2 +1 mod 2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 5+1=6 \u2192 6 mod 2 is 0. So 0 \u22610 \u2192 condition holds.\n\nAlso, L' must be even as per parity condition. L'=2 is even \u2192 condition holds.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 (2S'+1)=3 \u2192 S'=1. L'=S, which is l=0. J'=1.\n\nPauli condition: T=1 +0 +1 =2 \u2192 mod 2 is 0 \u2192 condition holds.\n\nL' is 0, which is even. Parity condition requires L' even for l=1 (from particle p in option B). So condition holds.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 (2S'+1)=3 \u2192 S'=1. L'=D=2. J'=3.\n\nPauli condition: 1 +2 +1 =4 \u2192 mod 2 is 0 \u2192 condition holds.\n\nL' is 2, which is even. From the emitted f (l=3), L' must be even (3+1=4, even) \u2192 condition holds.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 (2S'+1)=3 \u2192 S'=1. L'=P=1. J'=0.\n\nPauli condition: 1 +1 +1=3 \u2192 mod2 is 1 \u2192 which should be 0. So condition is violated.\n\nWait, but wait, the parity condition for option D: l=0 (s). So from parity condition earlier, L' must be odd.\n\nIn option D, L' is 1, which is odd. So parity condition holds.\n\nBut the Pauli condition: S' + L' =1 mod 2. S'=1, L'=1 \u2192 1+1=2 mod2=0. So 0 \u22610 \u2192 condition holds.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the Pauli condition for option D would be violated. Wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, the condition is T= S' + L' +1 mod2 \u2192 0= S' + L' +1 mod2 \u2192 S' + L' =1 mod2.\n\nIn option D:\n\nS'=1, L'=1 \u2192 1 +1 =2 \u2192 0 mod2. So 0 \u22611 \u2192 no, that's not correct. So condition not satisfied.\n\nSo for option D, the Pauli condition is violated. But wait, wait, according to the problem statement, the final state must satisfy T= S + L +1 mod2. So for option D, the final NN' state is 3P0, which is S'=1, L'=1.\n\nSo S' + L' +1 =1+1+1=3 \u2192 mod2 is 1. But T is 0. So 0 \u22611 \u2192 which is false. So this option violates the Pauli condition.\n\nBut wait, the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the partial wave is determined by the orbital angular momentum l of the emitted particle, which is given by the lowercase letter.\n\nSo for each option, the emitted particle's l is:\n\nA) p \u2192 l=1\nB) p \u2192 l=1\nC) f \u2192 l=3\nD) s \u2192 l=0\n\nSo the question is which of these l's is not allowed, given the conservation laws.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered parity, the parity condition in each case must hold. So in each case, L' must be even for l=1 and 3, and odd for l=0.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D: l=0 \u2192 L' must be odd. The final state is 3P0, which has L'=1 (since P is l=1). So L'=1 is odd, which satisfies the parity condition.\n\nBut the Pauli condition: S'=1, L'=1 \u2192 1 +1 =2 \u2192 mod2=0. So T=0 = (1+1+1) mod2 \u2192 3 mod2=1. So 0 !=1 \u2192 violates Pauli condition.\n\nSo the Pauli condition is not satisfied for option D. So this option is not allowed.\n\nWait, but why did I think earlier that the parity condition holds? Because for option D, l=0 \u2192 L' must be 1, which it is (L'=1). So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nBut the Pauli condition isn't satisfied for option D. So this partial wave is not permitted.\n\nWait, but let's check the other options.\n\nOption A: l=1 \u2192 L'=2 (even). So parity condition holds. Pauli condition: S'=3, L'=2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 mod2=1. So T=0 \u2192 0=1 +1 \u2192 0=0 \u2192 holds.\n\nWait, no, the condition is T= S' + L' +1 mod2.\n\nSo for option A: S'=3, L'=2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 5 +1 =6 \u2192 mod2=0 \u2192 T=0. So condition holds.\n\nSimilarly, for option B: S'=1, L'=0 \u2192 1+0=1 \u2192 +1 \u21922 \u2192 mod2=0 \u2192 T=0. Condition holds.\n\nOption C: S'=1, L'=2 \u21921+2=3 \u2192+1 \u21924 \u2192 mod2=0 \u2192 T=0. Condition holds.\n\nOnly option D violates the Pauli condition. So the partial wave not permitted is option D.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is which partial wave is not permitted. The partial wave is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So in option D, the emitted particle is 's', which is l=0. So the emitted particle's partial wave is s (l=0). The other options have p (l=1) or f (l=3).\n\nSo the only option that's not allowed is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear physics and quantum mechanics. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nThe question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state that emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) equals S(NN) plus L(NN) plus 1 modulo 2. Oh right, T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum.\n\nThe final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to find which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from 1S0 to another state plus a particle.\n\nWait, the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J), right? So for 1S0, the S is 0 because it's S0. So the term symbol would be (2*0+1)L(J) \u2192 1L J. But wait, the initial state is 1S0, which I think means S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me think. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, the S is the total spin of the two nucleons. S=0, so 2S+1=1. L is the orbital angular momentum. Since it's S, that's L=0. So J is the total angular momentum, which would be L + S, but since both are zero, J=0.\n\nSo the initial state is 1S0 \u2192 which is 1S0 with S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nThe particle X is emitted, so the final state is NN plus X. The problem says that the initial state is 1S0, and the options show transitions to other states plus a particle. So for each option, the initial is 1S0, and the final is something like 7D1 plus p, etc.\n\nWait, the question says that the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J), but in the options, the emitted particle is denoted by a lowercase letter, like p, s, f. Oh, I think those denote the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Like, s is l=0, p is l=1, d is l=2, f is l=3, etc.\n\nSo, for each option, the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is something like 7D1. Let me parse that. 7D1: The (2S+1) is 7, so 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3. Then L is D, which is l=2. And J is 1.\n\nWait, but the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. So the two nucleons are in a state with S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWhen they emit a particle X, the total angular momentum and parity must be conserved. Also, the Pauli exclusion principle imposes some condition on the isospin and spin and angular momentum.\n\nThe problem says that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin of the NN system, S is their total spin, L is their orbital angular momentum. So T = S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nIn the final state, the NN has T=0. So substituting into the equation: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nWait, but in the initial state, the NN is in 1S0. So S_initial = 0, L_initial =0. So the initial state has T_initial = 0 + 0 +1 mod 2 \u2192 T_initial =1. But wait, the initial state is 1S0, which is a bound state. But the question says that the NN system emits a particle, so the final state is NN plus X. Wait, no\u2014the initial state is the NN system in 1S0, and they emit X, so the final state is just the NN system? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the system is two nucleons, and they emit a particle X. So the final state is the two nucleons plus X. Or wait, no, the initial state is NN in 1S0, and they emit a particle X, so the final state is the NN plus X. So the NN after emission is in some state, and X is emitted.\n\nBut the problem statement says: \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0.\" So the NN after emission have T=0. So the initial NN had T=1, because T_initial = S_initial + L_initial +1 mod 2. S_initial is 0 (from 1S0), L_initial is 0, so T_initial = 0 +0 +1 =1 mod 2.\n\nSo the NN system's isospin goes from 1 to 0. Hmm, but that's a change. But isospin is a conserved quantity in strong interactions, but maybe the problem is considering that the emission of X is via a strong interaction, so isospin should be conserved. Wait, but the problem says the particle X is emitted, so perhaps the initial state has isospin T=1, and the final state's NN has T=0. That would imply that isospin isn't conserved, but perhaps the problem allows for that because X has some isospin as well.\n\nWait, but the problem is about parity and angular momentum conservation. Hmm.\n\nSo the process is NN in 1S0 \u2192 emits X, becoming NN' plus X. The NN' has T=0. So, the initial isospin is T_initial =1, and the final is T_NN' =0, and X has its own isospin. But perhaps isospin conservation isn't the main issue here, but the problem gives a condition on the final state's isospin, T=0.\n\nBut the main points are about angular momentum and parity.\n\nSo the initial state is 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0. The emitted particle X has some orbital angular momentum l (like p is l=1, s is l=0, d is l=2, f is l=3). So the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital part of the NN's state after emission is L'.\n\nWait, but the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial J is 0. The final state's angular momentum is the sum of the NN's J' and X's orbital angular momentum l, but I think it's more complicated. Alternatively, the process involves the NN system and X, so the total angular momentum must be conserved.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the process is the NN emitting X. So the initial state is J=0, and the final state is the NN in state with J' plus X's orbital angular momentum l.\n\nWait, but in reality, the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the total system. So the total angular momentum after emission is J' (of NN) plus l (of X), but also considering their relative orbital angular momentum.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think in terms of adding the angular momenta.\n\nWait, the initial state has J=0. So the total angular momentum after emission must also be 0. So J' (NN's) and l (X's) must combine to 0. But wait, that's only if X is a boson, but in reality, X could be any particle. Alternatively, the initial total angular momentum is zero, so the final must have total angular momentum zero.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model this as the NN system in some state and the emitted particle in some state. So the initial state is J_initial =0. The final state is the NN' with J' and the X with l (orbital angular momentum). So J_initial = J_final. So J' (NN') plus l (X) must sum to J_initial =0.\n\nWait, but J' and l are vectors, so their vector sum must be zero. So J' = -l. So J' must have the same magnitude as l, but opposite direction. So |J'| = l.\n\nBut the possible values of J' and l must allow for their vector sum to be zero. So J' must equal l, but in opposite direction. But since angular momentum is quantized, this would require that J' and l have the same magnitude. So l must equal J'.\n\nWait, but J' is the total angular momentum of the NN', which is the sum of their spin (S') and orbital angular momentum (L'). So J' = S' + L'.\n\nWait, but the NN' system has spin S' and orbital L', so J' = S' + L'.\n\nWait, but the initial state is S=0, L=0, so J=0. The emitted X carries away some orbital angular momentum, but the NN' system's L' would be determined by the process.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think in terms of conservation of parity.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by (-1)^L_initial. Since L_initial is 0, parity is 1.\n\nThe parity of the final state must also be 1 because parity is conserved in strong interactions (assuming X is a boson emitted via strong force). Wait, but the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. Hmm, but parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The parity of the final state would be the product of the parities of the NN' state and X's intrinsic parity, multiplied by (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X.\n\nWait, the parity of the final state (NN' + X) would be parity_NN' * parity_X * (-1)^l.\n\nSince parity is conserved, parity_initial = parity_final.\n\nParity_initial is (-1)^L_initial. L_initial is 0, so parity_initial =1.\n\nParity_final = parity_NN' * parity_X * (-1)^l.\n\nSo 1 = parity_NN' * (-1) * (-1)^l.\n\nBecause X has intrinsic parity -1.\n\nSo 1 = (-1) * (-1)^l * parity_NN'.\n\nLet me rearrange that:\n\nparity_NN' = [1] / [ (-1) * (-1)^l ] = [ (-1)^{-l-1} ].\n\nSo parity_NN' = (-1)^{-l-1} = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nBut the parity of the NN' state is determined by their orbital angular momentum L' as (-1)^L'.\n\nSo (-1)^L' = (-1)^{l+1} \u2192 L' = l +1 mod 2.\n\nSo L' must have the same parity as l+1.\n\nBut wait, L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system. So L' must be an integer, but its parity is determined by the equation above.\n\nSo for each option, we can compute l (from the emitted particle) and then determine what L' must be.\n\nThe options:\n\nA) 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p\nB) 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p\nC) 1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f\nD) 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s\n\nWait, in each case, the emitted particle is denoted by a letter. So in option A, it's p, which is l=1. In option B, p again, so l=1. C has f, which is l=3. D has s, which is l=0.\n\nSo for each option, l is:\n\nA) l=1\nB) l=1\nC) l=3\nD) l=0\n\nNow, for each case, compute L' must be l+1 mod 2.\n\nSo:\n\nA) l=1 \u2192 L' must be even (since 1+1=2 \u2192 even)\nB) l=1 \u2192 same as A: L' even\nC) l=3 \u2192 3+1=4 \u2192 even \u2192 L' even\nD) l=0 \u2192 0+1=1 \u2192 L' must be odd.\n\nWait, but wait, L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system. So L' must be an integer, but the parity (even or odd) is determined by l.\n\nSo for each option:\n\nA) l=1 \u2192 L' must be even (L' =0,2,4,...)\nB) same as A\nC) l=3 \u2192 L' even\nD) l=0 \u2192 L' must be odd (1,3,5...)\n\nNow, the NN' state after emission has a certain spin and orbital angular momentum. The Pauli condition says T = S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nIn the final state, T=0. So 0 = S' + L' +1 mod 2 \u2192 S' + L' = 1 mod 2.\n\nSo S' = 1 - L' mod 2.\n\nSo, for each option, let's see if the final state's S' and L' satisfy this.\n\nBut wait, the options give the final state of the NN' as, for example, 7D1. Let me parse that.\n\nThe term symbol is (2S'+1)L'(J'). So for each option:\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 (2S'+1)=7 \u2192 S'=3. L' is D, which is l=2. J' is 1.\n\nSo S'=3, L'=2.\n\nCheck Pauli condition: T = S' + L' +1 mod 2. T=0.\n\n0 \u2261 3 +2 +1 mod 2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 5+1=6 \u2192 6 mod 2 is 0. So 0 \u22610 \u2192 condition holds.\n\nAlso, L' must be even as per parity condition. L'=2 is even \u2192 condition holds.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 (2S'+1)=3 \u2192 S'=1. L'=S, which is l=0. J'=1.\n\nPauli condition: T=1 +0 +1 =2 \u2192 mod 2 is 0 \u2192 condition holds.\n\nL' is 0, which is even. Parity condition requires L' even for l=1 (from particle p in option B). So condition holds.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 (2S'+1)=3 \u2192 S'=1. L'=D=2. J'=3.\n\nPauli condition: 1 +2 +1 =4 \u2192 mod 2 is 0 \u2192 condition holds.\n\nL' is 2, which is even. From the emitted f (l=3), L' must be even (3+1=4, even) \u2192 condition holds.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 (2S'+1)=3 \u2192 S'=1. L'=P=1. J'=0.\n\nPauli condition: 1 +1 +1=3 \u2192 mod2 is 1 \u2192 which should be 0. So condition is violated.\n\nWait, but wait, the parity condition for option D: l=0 (s). So from parity condition earlier, L' must be odd.\n\nIn option D, L' is 1, which is odd. So parity condition holds.\n\nBut the Pauli condition: S' + L' =1 mod 2. S'=1, L'=1 \u2192 1+1=2 mod2=0. So 0 \u22610 \u2192 condition holds.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the Pauli condition for option D would be violated. Wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, the condition is T= S' + L' +1 mod2 \u2192 0= S' + L' +1 mod2 \u2192 S' + L' =1 mod2.\n\nIn option D:\n\nS'=1, L'=1 \u2192 1 +1 =2 \u2192 0 mod2. So 0 \u22611 \u2192 no, that's not correct. So condition not satisfied.\n\nSo for option D, the Pauli condition is violated. But wait, wait, according to the problem statement, the final state must satisfy T= S + L +1 mod2. So for option D, the final NN' state is 3P0, which is S'=1, L'=1.\n\nSo S' + L' +1 =1+1+1=3 \u2192 mod2 is 1. But T is 0. So 0 \u22611 \u2192 which is false. So this option violates the Pauli condition.\n\nBut wait, the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the partial wave is determined by the orbital angular momentum l of the emitted particle, which is given by the lowercase letter.\n\nSo for each option, the emitted particle's l is:\n\nA) p \u2192 l=1\nB) p \u2192 l=1\nC) f \u2192 l=3\nD) s \u2192 l=0\n\nSo the question is which of these l's is not allowed, given the conservation laws.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered parity, the parity condition in each case must hold. So in each case, L' must be even for l=1 and 3, and odd for l=0.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D: l=0 \u2192 L' must be odd. The final state is 3P0, which has L'=1 (since P is l=1). So L'=1 is odd, which satisfies the parity condition.\n\nBut the Pauli condition: S'=1, L'=1 \u2192 1 +1 =2 \u2192 mod2=0. So T=0 = (1+1+1) mod2 \u2192 3 mod2=1. So 0 !=1 \u2192 violates Pauli condition.\n\nSo the Pauli condition is not satisfied for option D. So this option is not allowed.\n\nWait, but why did I think earlier that the parity condition holds? Because for option D, l=0 \u2192 L' must be 1, which it is (L'=1). So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nBut the Pauli condition isn't satisfied for option D. So this partial wave is not permitted.\n\nWait, but let's check the other options.\n\nOption A: l=1 \u2192 L'=2 (even). So parity condition holds. Pauli condition: S'=3, L'=2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 mod2=1. So T=0 \u2192 0=1 +1 \u2192 0=0 \u2192 holds.\n\nWait, no, the condition is T= S' + L' +1 mod2.\n\nSo for option A: S'=3, L'=2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 5 +1 =6 \u2192 mod2=0 \u2192 T=0. So condition holds.\n\nSimilarly, for option B: S'=1, L'=0 \u2192 1+0=1 \u2192 +1 \u21922 \u2192 mod2=0 \u2192 T=0. Condition holds.\n\nOption C: S'=1, L'=2 \u21921+2=3 \u2192+1 \u21924 \u2192 mod2=0 \u2192 T=0. Condition holds.\n\nOnly option D violates the Pauli condition. So the partial wave not permitted is option D.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is which partial wave is not permitted. The partial wave is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So in option D, the emitted particle is 's', which is l=0. So the emitted particle's partial wave is s (l=0). The other options have p (l=1) or f (l=3).\n\nSo the only option that's not allowed is D.\n\n\nThe problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The initial state has S = 0, L = 0, and J = 0, corresponding to (2S+1)L(J) = 1S0. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0, and Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Additionally, parity conservation must be satisfied, which depends on the orbital angular momentum \\( l \\) of the emitted particle X.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Parity Conservation**:  \n   The parity of the initial state is \\( (-1)^L = 1 \\) (since \\( L = 0 \\)). The parity of the final state is given by \\( (-1)^{L'} \\cdot (-1)^l \\), where \\( L' \\) is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission, and \\( l \\) is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take a deep breath and tackle this. The question is about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons in a specific state. Hmm, I remember that nucleons are protons and neutrons, and when they're bound, they form something like a deuteron or other nuclei.\n\nThe initial state is a 1S0 state. I think the term symbol notation is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0 would mean S=0 because 2*0+1=1. The L is S, which is orbital angular momentum. And J is 0. So the initial state has L=0 and S=0, and J=0.\n\nThe system emits a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. So parity is a quantum number, and for particles, their intrinsic parity is given. For example, pions have intrinsic parity -1, I think. So the emitted particle X has parity -1.\n\nPauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused about this. Pauli exclusion principle applies to identical particles, so the NN system must obey it. But wait, the initial state is a bound state, so after emission, the two nucleons are still there but maybe in a different state.\n\nWait, the problem states that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So the isospin is zero. Since isospin is a vector, the combination must be zero. So the NN pair has isospin T=0.\n\nThe question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. The options are about the angular momentum state of X, denoted by lowercase letters. The options are 1S0 emitting into something like 7D1 + p, etc.\n\nSo I think the process is: initial state (1S0) \u2192 final state (NN in some state) plus X. We need to conserve angular momentum and parity.\n\nWait, but parity is conserved in strong interactions, but if the emission is via the strong force, then parity should be conserved. Alternatively, maybe the weak interaction doesn't conserve parity, but the problem says to use conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So I should assume parity is conserved in this process.\n\nSo, the initial parity is for the 1S0 state. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^(L+1), because for hydrogen-like atoms, parity is (-1)^(L). Wait, no, wait. The parity of a state is determined by the orbital angular momentum L. For the Coulomb potential, the parity is (-1)^L. But for the strong force, the potential is different, but the parity is still given by (-1)^(L+1) perhaps? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for a two-body system, the parity is given by the product of the intrinsic parities of the two particles and the parity of the relative orbital angular momentum. Nucleons (protons and neutrons) have intrinsic parity +1 each, I believe. So two nucleons, so product is +1. The parity from the orbital angular momentum is (-1)^L. So the total parity is (+1) * (-1)^L = (-1)^L.\n\nWait, but wait. For the two-nucleon system, the parity is (-1)^L multiplied by the product of the intrinsic parities. Since each nucleon has intrinsic parity +1, the product is +1. So the parity is (-1)^L.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. So L=0 (since it's S state). So initial parity is (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nThe emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the final state must be the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X, because parity is multiplicative.\n\nBut wait, the total parity after emission must equal the initial parity, because parity is conserved (assuming the interaction conserves parity). So initial parity: P_initial = (+1).\n\nAfter emission, the parity is P_final = P_NN * P_X. So P_NN * (-1) = P_initial \u2192 P_NN * (-1) = +1 \u2192 P_NN = -1.\n\nWait, but the parity of the NN state is (-1)^(L_NN), since their intrinsic parity is +1 each. So L_NN is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission.\n\nSo P_NN = (-1)^(L_NN) = (-1)^(L_NN). But P_NN must be -1, so (-1)^(L_NN) = -1 \u2192 L_NN must be odd. So L_NN is odd.\n\nSo the NN state after emission must have L_NN odd.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So isospin T=0. Now, the isospin is for the NN pair. The possible isospin states for two nucleons (each with isospin 1/2) can combine to T=0 or T=1.\n\nIn the initial state, the two nucleons are in a state that must have T=0 or T=1. The 1S0 state: S=0, L=0, J=0. So what is the isospin of the initial state? For the deuteron, which is a two-nucleon system, the ground state is 1S0 and has T=0. So the initial state here is T=0.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the initial state is 1S0. So the initial state has T=0, because it's the ground state. So after emission, the final NN state must have T=0 as well. Because the options give T(NN)=0.\n\nNow, the process is initial state (T=0, L=0, S=0, J=0) \u2192 final state (T=0, L=?, S=?, J=? ) plus X.\n\nWait, but the emitted particle X is a boson or fermion? Well, particles like pions are bosons, but the problem doesn't specify. But since Pauli statistics are being considered, perhaps X is a boson? Or wait, the question says that the Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Hmm, so that's a condition on the final state.\n\nWait, the equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 (mod 2). So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. All are quantum numbers modulo 2. So adding them as mod 2.\n\nGiven that T(NN) is 0, so 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2.\n\nWhich implies that S and L must have opposite parity. If S is even (0 mod 2), L is odd, and vice versa.\n\nSo in the final NN state, S + L is odd.\n\nNow, the NN system after emission must have S and L such that their sum is odd.\n\nAdditionally, from the parity consideration earlier, L_NN must be odd.\n\nSo L_NN is odd. So S must be even (because S + odd = odd \u2192 S must be even).\n\nSo S is even. So possible values for S are 0, 2, etc. But for two nucleons, the total spin S can be 0 or 1. Because each nucleon has spin 1/2. So combining two spin-1/2 particles, S can be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). So in the final state, S can be 0 or 1. But since S must be even, S=0 is even, S=1 is odd. So S must be 0.\n\nBecause S must be even, and the only even possible S is 0.\n\nSo the final NN state must have S=0 and L is odd.\n\nSo the NN state after emission has S=0, L is odd. And J is the total angular momentum, which is given by the coupling of L and S. Since S=0, J = L. So J = L.\n\nSo J must be equal to L, which is odd. So J is odd.\n\nNow, the problem is about the partial wave of the emitted particle X. The partial wave is denoted by the lowercase letter, like p, s, etc., which correspond to spin states. Wait, no, the letters denote the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So 's' is l=0, 'p' is l=1, 'd' is l=2, 'f' is l=3, etc.\n\nWait, the options are like 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. So 'p' is the orbital angular momentum state of X. So in this case, the emitted particle X has l=1 (p state).\n\nSo for each option, X is emitted in a certain l. So the total angular momentum must be conserved.\n\nWait, the initial state has J=0. After emission, the total angular momentum is the sum of the angular momentum of the NN state and the angular momentum of X. So:\n\nJ_initial = 0 = J_final_total.\n\nSo J_final_total = J_NN + J_X (vector sum).\n\nBut J_NN is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is equal to L_NN (since S=0). And J_X is the total angular momentum of X. Since X is a spin-0 particle? Or does it have spin?\n\nWait, the problem says X is a particle. It doesn't specify its spin, but for the purposes of angular momentum conservation, X's spin would contribute. But if X is a scalar particle (spin 0), then its angular momentum is just l (orbital angular momentum). If it's a vector particle (spin 1), then it has spin and orbital angular momentum. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that X is spin-0, so its total angular momentum is just l.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only orbital angular momentum. Hmm, but the question is about partial waves, which are denoted by orbital angular momentum. So the 'p' in the options refers to the orbital angular momentum of X, which is l=1. So the total angular momentum of X would be l, assuming it's spin-0.\n\nBut wait, the problem says 'the angular momentum state of X', which is the orbital angular momentum. So X's angular momentum is l. So J_X = l.\n\nSo the initial state has J=0. The final state has J_NN = L_NN, which is odd. And J_X = l.\n\nSo the sum of L_NN and l must be zero. But that's not possible unless both are zero. Wait, no, because angular momentum is a vector sum. But how can J_initial (0) be equal to the vector sum of J_NN and J_X? Wait, wait, no. The initial state has J_initial=0. The final state must have the same total angular momentum, so the vector sum of J_NN and J_X must be zero.\n\nSo J_NN + J_X = 0.\n\nWhich implies that J_NN = - J_X. But since both are vectors, this would require that J_NN and J_X are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nBut since J_NN is L_NN (since S=0), and J_X is l (assuming X is spin-0), then:\n\nL_NN = - l.\n\nBut since L_NN is a magnitude, and l is a magnitude, this would require that L_NN = l, and the directions are opposite. But since both are vectors, the only way their sum is zero is if they have the same magnitude and opposite direction. However, in quantum mechanics, the possible values are determined by the addition of angular momenta. So the total J (sum) must be zero, which implies that J_NN and J_X must combine to zero.\n\nWait, but the initial J is zero, so the total J after emission must also be zero. So the vector sum of J_NN and J_X must be zero. So J_NN and J_X must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. But in quantum mechanics, the possible total angular momenta are given by the addition of two angular momenta.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of possible L_NN and l that allow the sum to be zero.\n\nBut let's think in terms of possible values. For the vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must satisfy L_NN = l, and the directions must be opposite. But in quantum mechanics, this is only possible if J_NN and J_X have the same magnitude and are in opposite directions. But since L_NN and l are both orbital angular momenta, their directions are determined by their respective spatial parts.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think in terms of possible L_NN and l that can couple to give a total J=0.\n\nSo the possible combinations are when L_NN and l are such that their vector sum can be zero. The possible values would be when L_NN = l, and the state is such that their sum is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the possible total J can be |L_NN - l| \u2264 J \u2264 L_NN + l. For J=0, we must have L_NN = l, because |L_NN - l| must be zero, so L_NN = l.\n\nSo for the sum to be zero, L_NN must equal l.\n\nSo L_NN = l.\n\nBut earlier, we found that L_NN must be odd.\n\nSo l must be odd as well.\n\nBecause L_NN is odd, l must be equal to L_NN, which is odd. So l must be odd.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 1S0 ->7D1 + p. So X has l=1 (p state). So l=1, which is odd. So this is allowed.\n\nOption B: 1S0 ->3S1 + p. X has l=1. So allowed.\n\nOption C: 1S0 ->3D3 + f. X has l=3 (f state). So allowed.\n\nOption D:1S0 ->3P0 + s. X has l=0 (s state). l=0, which is even. So this would require L_NN = l=0. But earlier, we found that L_NN must be odd. So this would be a problem.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me re-express this. The emitted X has orbital angular momentum l. The NN state has L_NN. The condition is L_NN = l (to have their sum zero). But since L_NN must be odd, l must be odd.\n\nSo if X is emitted in an s state (l=0), which is even, then L_NN must be 0, which is even. But earlier, we found that L_NN must be odd. So this is a conflict.\n\nSo in option D, X is emitted in s state (l=0). Then L_NN would have to be 0, which is even, but we have L_NN must be odd. So this is not allowed. So option D is not permitted.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up the orbital angular momentum and spin.\n\nWait, the problem is about the angular momentum state of X. So in the options, the letters after the NN state (like D1, S1, etc.) are the orbital angular momentum of X. So for option D, X is in s state, l=0.\n\nSo let me check each option:\n\nOption A: X has l=1 \u2192 allowed (since l is odd, and L_NN must be 1, which is odd).\n\nOption B: X has l=1 \u2192 same as A.\n\nOption C: X has l=3 \u2192 allowed.\n\nOption D: X has l=0 \u2192 even. So L_NN would have to be 0, but L_NN must be odd. So this is not allowed.\n\nSo the partial wave not permitted is option D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the other conditions.\n\nAlso, the problem states that the initial state is 1S0, which has L=0, S=0, J=0. After emission, the NN state has T=0, so we've already considered that.\n\nSo the key point is that L_NN must be odd, and X's orbital angular momentum l must equal L_NN. Therefore, l must be odd.\n\nSo any option where X's orbital angular momentum is even (like s: l=0) is not allowed. So option D is the one that's not permitted.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The initial state has **L = 0**, **S = 0**, and **J = 0**, and the NN system has isospin **T = 0**. After emission, the final NN state must also have **T = 0**, and the system must conserve both angular momentum and parity.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Parity Conservation**:  \n   The parity of the initial state is **P_initial = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1**. After emission, the parity of the system is given by **P_final = P_NN * P_X**, where **P_X = -1** (intrinsic parity of X). Thus, **P_NN * (-1) = +1**, which implies **P_NN = -1**.  \n   The parity of the NN state is **P_NN = (-1)^L_NN**, so **(-1)^L_NN = -1**, meaning **L_NN must be odd**.\n\n2. **Pauli Statistics**:  \n   The condition **T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)** is given. Since **T(NN) = 0**, this implies **S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 = 0 (mod 2)**, or **S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 (mod 2)**.  \n   Since **L_NN is odd**, **S(NN) must be even**. For two nucleons, the possible total spin is **S = 0** (even) or **S = 1** (odd). Thus, **S(NN) = 0**.\n\n3. **Angular Momentum Conservation**:  \n   The initial state has **J_initial = 0**, so the total angular momentum after emission must also satisfy **J_NN + J_X = 0**. Since **S(NN) = 0**, the total angular momentum of the NN state is **J_NN = L_NN**. For the total angular momentum to be zero, **L_NN = l**, where **l** is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.  \n   Since **L_NN must be odd**, **l must also be odd**.\n\n4. **Analysis of Options**:  \n   - **Option A (1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p)**: X has **l = 1** (p state), which is odd. This is allowed.  \n   - **Option B (1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p)**: X has **l = 1** (p state), which is odd. This is allowed.  \n   - **Option C (1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f)**: X has **l = 3** (f state), which is odd. This is allowed.  \n   - **Option D (1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s)**: X has **l = 0** (s state), which is even. This violates the condition that **l must be odd**. Thus, this partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe partial wave not permitted is **Option D**, as it involves the emission of a particle with **l = 0** (s state), which is even and incompatible with the requirement that **l must be odd**.\n\n**Answer: D**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take a deep breath and tackle this. The question is about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons in a specific state. Hmm, I remember that nucleons are protons and neutrons, and when they're bound, they form something like a deuteron or other nuclei.\n\nThe initial state is a 1S0 state. I think the term symbol notation is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0 would mean S=0 because 2*0+1=1. The L is S, which is orbital angular momentum. And J is 0. So the initial state has L=0 and S=0, and J=0.\n\nThe system emits a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. So parity is a quantum number, and for particles, their intrinsic parity is given. For example, pions have intrinsic parity -1, I think. So the emitted particle X has parity -1.\n\nPauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused about this. Pauli exclusion principle applies to identical particles, so the NN system must obey it. But wait, the initial state is a bound state, so after emission, the two nucleons are still there but maybe in a different state.\n\nWait, the problem states that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So the isospin is zero. Since isospin is a vector, the combination must be zero. So the NN pair has isospin T=0.\n\nThe question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. The options are about the angular momentum state of X, denoted by lowercase letters. The options are 1S0 emitting into something like 7D1 + p, etc.\n\nSo I think the process is: initial state (1S0) \u2192 final state (NN in some state) plus X. We need to conserve angular momentum and parity.\n\nWait, but parity is conserved in strong interactions, but if the emission is via the strong force, then parity should be conserved. Alternatively, maybe the weak interaction doesn't conserve parity, but the problem says to use conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So I should assume parity is conserved in this process.\n\nSo, the initial parity is for the 1S0 state. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^(L+1), because for hydrogen-like atoms, parity is (-1)^(L). Wait, no, wait. The parity of a state is determined by the orbital angular momentum L. For the Coulomb potential, the parity is (-1)^L. But for the strong force, the potential is different, but the parity is still given by (-1)^(L+1) perhaps? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for a two-body system, the parity is given by the product of the intrinsic parities of the two particles and the parity of the relative orbital angular momentum. Nucleons (protons and neutrons) have intrinsic parity +1 each, I believe. So two nucleons, so product is +1. The parity from the orbital angular momentum is (-1)^L. So the total parity is (+1) * (-1)^L = (-1)^L.\n\nWait, but wait. For the two-nucleon system, the parity is (-1)^L multiplied by the product of the intrinsic parities. Since each nucleon has intrinsic parity +1, the product is +1. So the parity is (-1)^L.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. So L=0 (since it's S state). So initial parity is (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nThe emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the final state must be the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X, because parity is multiplicative.\n\nBut wait, the total parity after emission must equal the initial parity, because parity is conserved (assuming the interaction conserves parity). So initial parity: P_initial = (+1).\n\nAfter emission, the parity is P_final = P_NN * P_X. So P_NN * (-1) = P_initial \u2192 P_NN * (-1) = +1 \u2192 P_NN = -1.\n\nWait, but the parity of the NN state is (-1)^(L_NN), since their intrinsic parity is +1 each. So L_NN is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission.\n\nSo P_NN = (-1)^(L_NN) = (-1)^(L_NN). But P_NN must be -1, so (-1)^(L_NN) = -1 \u2192 L_NN must be odd. So L_NN is odd.\n\nSo the NN state after emission must have L_NN odd.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So isospin T=0. Now, the isospin is for the NN pair. The possible isospin states for two nucleons (each with isospin 1/2) can combine to T=0 or T=1.\n\nIn the initial state, the two nucleons are in a state that must have T=0 or T=1. The 1S0 state: S=0, L=0, J=0. So what is the isospin of the initial state? For the deuteron, which is a two-nucleon system, the ground state is 1S0 and has T=0. So the initial state here is T=0.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the initial state is 1S0. So the initial state has T=0, because it's the ground state. So after emission, the final NN state must have T=0 as well. Because the options give T(NN)=0.\n\nNow, the process is initial state (T=0, L=0, S=0, J=0) \u2192 final state (T=0, L=?, S=?, J=? ) plus X.\n\nWait, but the emitted particle X is a boson or fermion? Well, particles like pions are bosons, but the problem doesn't specify. But since Pauli statistics are being considered, perhaps X is a boson? Or wait, the question says that the Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Hmm, so that's a condition on the final state.\n\nWait, the equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 (mod 2). So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. All are quantum numbers modulo 2. So adding them as mod 2.\n\nGiven that T(NN) is 0, so 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2.\n\nWhich implies that S and L must have opposite parity. If S is even (0 mod 2), L is odd, and vice versa.\n\nSo in the final NN state, S + L is odd.\n\nNow, the NN system after emission must have S and L such that their sum is odd.\n\nAdditionally, from the parity consideration earlier, L_NN must be odd.\n\nSo L_NN is odd. So S must be even (because S + odd = odd \u2192 S must be even).\n\nSo S is even. So possible values for S are 0, 2, etc. But for two nucleons, the total spin S can be 0 or 1. Because each nucleon has spin 1/2. So combining two spin-1/2 particles, S can be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). So in the final state, S can be 0 or 1. But since S must be even, S=0 is even, S=1 is odd. So S must be 0.\n\nBecause S must be even, and the only even possible S is 0.\n\nSo the final NN state must have S=0 and L is odd.\n\nSo the NN state after emission has S=0, L is odd. And J is the total angular momentum, which is given by the coupling of L and S. Since S=0, J = L. So J = L.\n\nSo J must be equal to L, which is odd. So J is odd.\n\nNow, the problem is about the partial wave of the emitted particle X. The partial wave is denoted by the lowercase letter, like p, s, etc., which correspond to spin states. Wait, no, the letters denote the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So 's' is l=0, 'p' is l=1, 'd' is l=2, 'f' is l=3, etc.\n\nWait, the options are like 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. So 'p' is the orbital angular momentum state of X. So in this case, the emitted particle X has l=1 (p state).\n\nSo for each option, X is emitted in a certain l. So the total angular momentum must be conserved.\n\nWait, the initial state has J=0. After emission, the total angular momentum is the sum of the angular momentum of the NN state and the angular momentum of X. So:\n\nJ_initial = 0 = J_final_total.\n\nSo J_final_total = J_NN + J_X (vector sum).\n\nBut J_NN is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is equal to L_NN (since S=0). And J_X is the total angular momentum of X. Since X is a spin-0 particle? Or does it have spin?\n\nWait, the problem says X is a particle. It doesn't specify its spin, but for the purposes of angular momentum conservation, X's spin would contribute. But if X is a scalar particle (spin 0), then its angular momentum is just l (orbital angular momentum). If it's a vector particle (spin 1), then it has spin and orbital angular momentum. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that X is spin-0, so its total angular momentum is just l.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only orbital angular momentum. Hmm, but the question is about partial waves, which are denoted by orbital angular momentum. So the 'p' in the options refers to the orbital angular momentum of X, which is l=1. So the total angular momentum of X would be l, assuming it's spin-0.\n\nBut wait, the problem says 'the angular momentum state of X', which is the orbital angular momentum. So X's angular momentum is l. So J_X = l.\n\nSo the initial state has J=0. The final state has J_NN = L_NN, which is odd. And J_X = l.\n\nSo the sum of L_NN and l must be zero. But that's not possible unless both are zero. Wait, no, because angular momentum is a vector sum. But how can J_initial (0) be equal to the vector sum of J_NN and J_X? Wait, wait, no. The initial state has J_initial=0. The final state must have the same total angular momentum, so the vector sum of J_NN and J_X must be zero.\n\nSo J_NN + J_X = 0.\n\nWhich implies that J_NN = - J_X. But since both are vectors, this would require that J_NN and J_X are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nBut since J_NN is L_NN (since S=0), and J_X is l (assuming X is spin-0), then:\n\nL_NN = - l.\n\nBut since L_NN is a magnitude, and l is a magnitude, this would require that L_NN = l, and the directions are opposite. But since both are vectors, the only way their sum is zero is if they have the same magnitude and opposite direction. However, in quantum mechanics, the possible values are determined by the addition of angular momenta. So the total J (sum) must be zero, which implies that J_NN and J_X must combine to zero.\n\nWait, but the initial J is zero, so the total J after emission must also be zero. So the vector sum of J_NN and J_X must be zero. So J_NN and J_X must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. But in quantum mechanics, the possible total angular momenta are given by the addition of two angular momenta.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of possible L_NN and l that allow the sum to be zero.\n\nBut let's think in terms of possible values. For the vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must satisfy L_NN = l, and the directions must be opposite. But in quantum mechanics, this is only possible if J_NN and J_X have the same magnitude and are in opposite directions. But since L_NN and l are both orbital angular momenta, their directions are determined by their respective spatial parts.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think in terms of possible L_NN and l that can couple to give a total J=0.\n\nSo the possible combinations are when L_NN and l are such that their vector sum can be zero. The possible values would be when L_NN = l, and the state is such that their sum is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the possible total J can be |L_NN - l| \u2264 J \u2264 L_NN + l. For J=0, we must have L_NN = l, because |L_NN - l| must be zero, so L_NN = l.\n\nSo for the sum to be zero, L_NN must equal l.\n\nSo L_NN = l.\n\nBut earlier, we found that L_NN must be odd.\n\nSo l must be odd as well.\n\nBecause L_NN is odd, l must be equal to L_NN, which is odd. So l must be odd.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 1S0 ->7D1 + p. So X has l=1 (p state). So l=1, which is odd. So this is allowed.\n\nOption B: 1S0 ->3S1 + p. X has l=1. So allowed.\n\nOption C: 1S0 ->3D3 + f. X has l=3 (f state). So allowed.\n\nOption D:1S0 ->3P0 + s. X has l=0 (s state). l=0, which is even. So this would require L_NN = l=0. But earlier, we found that L_NN must be odd. So this would be a problem.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me re-express this. The emitted X has orbital angular momentum l. The NN state has L_NN. The condition is L_NN = l (to have their sum zero). But since L_NN must be odd, l must be odd.\n\nSo if X is emitted in an s state (l=0), which is even, then L_NN must be 0, which is even. But earlier, we found that L_NN must be odd. So this is a conflict.\n\nSo in option D, X is emitted in s state (l=0). Then L_NN would have to be 0, which is even, but we have L_NN must be odd. So this is not allowed. So option D is not permitted.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up the orbital angular momentum and spin.\n\nWait, the problem is about the angular momentum state of X. So in the options, the letters after the NN state (like D1, S1, etc.) are the orbital angular momentum of X. So for option D, X is in s state, l=0.\n\nSo let me check each option:\n\nOption A: X has l=1 \u2192 allowed (since l is odd, and L_NN must be 1, which is odd).\n\nOption B: X has l=1 \u2192 same as A.\n\nOption C: X has l=3 \u2192 allowed.\n\nOption D: X has l=0 \u2192 even. So L_NN would have to be 0, but L_NN must be odd. So this is not allowed.\n\nSo the partial wave not permitted is option D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the other conditions.\n\nAlso, the problem states that the initial state is 1S0, which has L=0, S=0, J=0. After emission, the NN state has T=0, so we've already considered that.\n\nSo the key point is that L_NN must be odd, and X's orbital angular momentum l must equal L_NN. Therefore, l must be odd.\n\nSo any option where X's orbital angular momentum is even (like s: l=0) is not allowed. So option D is the one that's not permitted.\n\n\nThe problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The initial state has **L = 0**, **S = 0**, and **J = 0**, and the NN system has isospin **T = 0**. After emission, the final NN state must also have **T = 0**, and the system must conserve both angular momentum and parity.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Parity Conservation**:  \n   The parity of the initial state is **P_initial = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1**. After emission, the parity of the system is given by **P_final = P_NN * P_X**, where **P_X = -1** (intrinsic parity of X). Thus, **P_NN * (-1) = +1**, which implies **P_NN = -1**.  \n   The parity of the NN state is **P_NN = (-1)^L_NN**, so **(-1)^L_NN = -1**, meaning **L_NN must be odd**.\n\n2. **Pauli Statistics**:  \n   The condition **T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)** is given. Since **T(NN) = 0**, this implies **S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 = 0 (mod 2)**, or **S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 (mod 2)**.  \n   Since **L_NN is odd**, **S(NN) must be even**. For two nucleons, the possible total spin is **S = 0** (even) or **S = 1** (odd). Thus, **S(NN) = 0**.\n\n3. **Angular Momentum Conservation**:  \n   The initial state has **J_initial = 0**, so the total angular momentum after emission must also satisfy **J_NN + J_X = 0**. Since **S(NN) = 0**, the total angular momentum of the NN state is **J_NN = L_NN**. For the total angular momentum to be zero, **L_NN = l**, where **l** is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.  \n   Since **L_NN must be odd**, **l must also be odd**.\n\n4. **Analysis of Options**:  \n   - **Option A (1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p)**: X has **l = 1** (p state), which is odd. This is allowed.  \n   - **Option B (1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p)**: X has **l = 1** (p state), which is odd. This is allowed.  \n   - **Option C (1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f)**: X has **l = 3** (f state), which is odd. This is allowed.  \n   - **Option D (1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s)**: X has **l = 0** (s state), which is even. This violates the condition that **l must be odd**. Thus, this partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe partial wave not permitted is **Option D**, as it involves the emission of a particle with **l = 0** (s state), which is even and incompatible with the requirement that **l must be odd**.\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe question says we have a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli exclusion principle is involved here, which imposes certain conditions on the quantum numbers of the final state. The formula given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, I remember that in particle physics, the Pauli exclusion principle relates the isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum in this way because of the requirement that the total wavefunction be antisymmetric.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. So breaking that down, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). Wait, the initial state is 1S0, so S is 0, right? Because 2S+1 =1 implies S=0. The L here is S, which is the orbital angular momentum. So the initial state has L=0 because S here is the orbital part? Wait no, the notation is a bit confusing. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would be S=0, L=0 (since it's S state), and J=0. So the initial NN state has S=0, L=0, and J=0.\n\nWait, but when they emit a particle X, the NN state changes. So the final NN state has T=0. The problem says that T(NN)=0, so the isospin of the two nucleons is zero.\n\nNow, the Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So substituting T=0, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. That simplifies to S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parities. So if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.\n\nBut wait, S is the total spin of the NN system. Wait, the initial state was S=0, but after emitting a particle, the spin might change. Or wait, no, the spin of the NN system would have to combine with the spin of the emitted particle X. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the Pauli statistics condition is about the symmetry of the overall wavefunction, which depends on the quantum numbers of the particles. For identical particles, the wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. But in this case, the emitted particle X is not a nucleon, right? Wait, the question says \"a bound system of two nucleons (NN)\" emit a particle X. So X is a different particle, not a nucleon. So maybe the Pauli exclusion principle here is about the system's overall quantum numbers. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking about this correctly.\n\nWait, the problem says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Oh, okay, so it's a condition that applies to the NN system after emission. So the NN system's isospin T, their total spin S, and orbital angular momentum L must satisfy this equation.\n\nSo the final NN state has T=0. So plugging into T = S + L +1 mod 2:\n\n0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2 \u2192 S and L have opposite parities.\n\nSo S and L must sum to an odd number. So either S is even (like 0) and L is odd (like 1,3,...) or S is odd and L even.\n\nBut what are the possible values of S and L for the NN system in the final state?\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWhen the NN system emits a particle X, their total angular momentum J might change. Wait, but the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial J is 0 (since 1S0), so the final state's J must also be 0 because angular momentum is conserved. So the NN system's J in the final state is 0.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the partial waves allowed for the emitted particle X. Each option gives the initial state (1S0) and the final state as something like 7D1 + p. The letters after the numbers (like p, s, f, d) denote the orbital angular momentum quantum number L for X. Because in spectroscopic notation, letters correspond to L: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the parity and angular momentum conservation. So the parity of the initial state and the parity of the final state must be the same because parity is a conserved quantity in strong interactions (assuming this is an electromagnetic or strong process, but the question doesn't specify).\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0. So its parity is given by (-1)^(L) * intrinsic parity. Wait, for a two-nucleon system, the parity is (\u22121)^(L + S), but wait, I think for a system of two spin-\u00bd particles, the parity is (\u22121)^L * (intrinsic parity)^number_of_particles. But the intrinsic parity of a nucleon is +1, because for fermions like protons and neutrons, their intrinsic parity is +1. So for the initial state, parity P_initial = (-1)^L * (1)^2 = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nWhen they emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the process must be conserved. So the parity of the initial state (P_initial) times the parity of X (P_X) should equal the parity of the final NN state (P_final) times the parity of the emitted particle's state (P_X_final). Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nWait, more accurately: the total parity before and after emission must be the same, assuming parity is conserved. So P_initial = P_final * P_X. Because the system (NN) emits X, so their combined parity must be the same before and after.\n\nThe initial parity is P_initial = (\u22121)^{L_initial} * (intrinsic parity)^2. Since both nucleons have intrinsic parity +1, (intrinsic parity)^2 = +1. L_initial is 0 (S state), so P_initial = (+1)^0 * 1 = +1.\n\nAfter emission, the parity is P_final * P_X. P_final is the parity of the final NN state, which is (\u22121)^{L_final} * (intrinsic parity)^2. Again, (intrinsic parity)^2 = +1. So P_final = (\u22121)^{L_final}.\n\nThe emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is (\u22121)^{L_X} * (\u22121), where L_X is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of X. Wait, no. Wait, the parity of a particle is a combination of its intrinsic parity and the orbital part. So the parity is P_X = (\u22121)^{L_X} * (intrinsic parity of X). Since the problem says the intrinsic parity of X is -1, P_X = (-1)^{L_X} * (-1).\n\nPutting it all together, the parity conservation equation is:\n\nP_initial = P_final * P_X\n\nSo:\n\n1 = [ (\u22121)^{L_final} ] * [ (\u22121)^{L_X} * (-1) ]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n(\u22121)^{L_final} * (\u22121)^{L_X} * (-1) = (\u22121)^{L_final + L_X} * (-1)\n\nSo,\n\n1 = (\u22121)^{L_final + L_X} * (-1)\n\nMultiply both sides by (-1):\n\n-1 = (\u22121)^{L_final + L_X}\n\nWhich implies that (\u22121)^{L_final + L_X} = -1 \u2192 L_final + L_X must be odd.\n\nSo L_final + L_X is odd \u2192 L_final and L_X have opposite parities.\n\nNow, the final NN state's L is given in each option. Let's look at each option.\n\nEach option gives the final state as something like 7D1. The part after the arrow is the NN state and the emitted particle. So for example, option A: 1S0 \u21927D1 + p. The 7D1 refers to the NN state, I think. Wait, the notation might be a bit unclear, but I think the part after the arrow is the final state of the NN system plus the emitted particle.\n\nWait, in the options, the format is 1S0 \u2192 (NN state) + (particle). So for option A, the NN state is 7D1. So the L_final for the NN state is D, which is L=2. Because D corresponds to L=2.\n\nSo L_final for option A is 2. Then, X in option A is p, which is a particle. So the emitted particle is a proton. Wait, but the parity of X is intrinsic parity -1, but for a pion (maybe X is a pion?), but wait, the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1, but the options have p, s, f, etc. Hmm, p is a proton. Wait, but a proton has intrinsic parity +1, not -1. Wait, maybe X is a pion? Or perhaps the options have a typo. Wait, but the question says X has intrinsic parity -1. So perhaps in the options, the emitted particle's letter refers to its orbital angular momentum, not the particle type. Let me think.\n\nWait, the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is denoted by the lowercase letter. So, for example, in option A, the emitted particle is p, which I think refers to the orbital angular momentum l=1 (p state). So the L_X is 1.\n\nSo for each option:\n\nOption A: NN state is 7D1 \u2192 L_final=2. X is p \u2192 L_X=1.\n\nSo L_final + L_X = 2 +1=3 \u2192 odd. So parity is conserved.\n\nNow, check the Pauli condition for the NN state.\n\nThe NN final state has T=0.\n\nSo the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L = 1 mod 2.\n\nSo for each option, we need to find the possible S and L for the NN state.\n\nBut wait, the NN state in each option is given as, for example, 7D1. Wait, 7D1 would be (2S+1)L(J), so 7 is (2S+1), so 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3. L is D \u2192 L=2. J is 1. So for option A, the final NN state has S=3, L=2, J=1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the initial NN state has J=0. So how does J change? Oh, because when emitting a particle, the angular momentum of the NN system could change, but the total angular momentum must be conserved. Wait, but the initial J is 0, so the final J of the NN system plus the angular momentum of the emitted particle must sum to J=0.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the angular momentum carried away by the emitted particle. Hmm, maybe the initial J is zero, so the emitted particle must carry away some angular momentum, which would require that the NN system's J plus the X's angular momentum equals the initial J, which is zero. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is more about the selection rules based on the Pauli condition and parity conservation, rather than the detailed angular momentum addition. Let me focus on that.\n\nSo, for each option, we can determine S and L for the NN state, then see if they satisfy S + L \u22611 mod 2 (since T=0).\n\nOption A: NN state is 7D1 \u2192 (2S+1)=7 \u2192 S=3. L=2 (D). So S=3 (odd), L=2 (even). So S + L = 3+2=5 \u2192 1 mod 2. So condition is satisfied. So this is allowed.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p \u2192 The NN state is 3S1. So (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L=0 (S). So S=1 (odd), L=0 (even). S+L=1 \u2192 1 mod 2. Condition is satisfied. So this is allowed.\n\nOption C: 3D3 + f \u2192 NN state is 3D3. (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L=2 (D). S=1 (odd), L=2 (even). S+L=3 \u2192 1 mod 2. Condition is satisfied. So allowed.\n\nOption D: 3P0 + s \u2192 NN state is 3P0. (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L=1 (P). S=1 (odd), L=1 (odd). S + L = 2 \u2192 0 mod 2. So condition is 0=1 mod 2? No, that would be 0=1, which is false. So this option would not satisfy the Pauli condition. So this partial wave is not permitted.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check each step again. For option D, the NN state is 3P0. So S=1, L=1. So S + L = 2 \u2192 even, which is 0 mod 2. The condition is that S + L should be 1 mod 2. So 0 is not equal to 1 mod 2. Therefore, option D doesn't satisfy the condition. So the partial wave in option D is not permitted.\n\nAdditionally, let's check the parity condition for each option.\n\nEarlier, we found that L_final + L_X must be odd.\n\nOption D: L_final is 1 (P), X is s \u2192 L_X=0.\n\nSo 1 + 0=1 \u2192 odd. So parity condition is satisfied. But the Pauli condition is not, so option D is not allowed.\n\nSo the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer would be option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe question says we have a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli exclusion principle is involved here, which imposes certain conditions on the quantum numbers of the final state. The formula given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, I remember that in particle physics, the Pauli exclusion principle relates the isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum in this way because of the requirement that the total wavefunction be antisymmetric.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. So breaking that down, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). Wait, the initial state is 1S0, so S is 0, right? Because 2S+1 =1 implies S=0. The L here is S, which is the orbital angular momentum. So the initial state has L=0 because S here is the orbital part? Wait no, the notation is a bit confusing. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would be S=0, L=0 (since it's S state), and J=0. So the initial NN state has S=0, L=0, and J=0.\n\nWait, but when they emit a particle X, the NN state changes. So the final NN state has T=0. The problem says that T(NN)=0, so the isospin of the two nucleons is zero.\n\nNow, the Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So substituting T=0, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. That simplifies to S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parities. So if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.\n\nBut wait, S is the total spin of the NN system. Wait, the initial state was S=0, but after emitting a particle, the spin might change. Or wait, no, the spin of the NN system would have to combine with the spin of the emitted particle X. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the Pauli statistics condition is about the symmetry of the overall wavefunction, which depends on the quantum numbers of the particles. For identical particles, the wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. But in this case, the emitted particle X is not a nucleon, right? Wait, the question says \"a bound system of two nucleons (NN)\" emit a particle X. So X is a different particle, not a nucleon. So maybe the Pauli exclusion principle here is about the system's overall quantum numbers. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking about this correctly.\n\nWait, the problem says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Oh, okay, so it's a condition that applies to the NN system after emission. So the NN system's isospin T, their total spin S, and orbital angular momentum L must satisfy this equation.\n\nSo the final NN state has T=0. So plugging into T = S + L +1 mod 2:\n\n0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2 \u2192 S and L have opposite parities.\n\nSo S and L must sum to an odd number. So either S is even (like 0) and L is odd (like 1,3,...) or S is odd and L even.\n\nBut what are the possible values of S and L for the NN system in the final state?\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWhen the NN system emits a particle X, their total angular momentum J might change. Wait, but the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial J is 0 (since 1S0), so the final state's J must also be 0 because angular momentum is conserved. So the NN system's J in the final state is 0.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the partial waves allowed for the emitted particle X. Each option gives the initial state (1S0) and the final state as something like 7D1 + p. The letters after the numbers (like p, s, f, d) denote the orbital angular momentum quantum number L for X. Because in spectroscopic notation, letters correspond to L: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the parity and angular momentum conservation. So the parity of the initial state and the parity of the final state must be the same because parity is a conserved quantity in strong interactions (assuming this is an electromagnetic or strong process, but the question doesn't specify).\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0. So its parity is given by (-1)^(L) * intrinsic parity. Wait, for a two-nucleon system, the parity is (\u22121)^(L + S), but wait, I think for a system of two spin-\u00bd particles, the parity is (\u22121)^L * (intrinsic parity)^number_of_particles. But the intrinsic parity of a nucleon is +1, because for fermions like protons and neutrons, their intrinsic parity is +1. So for the initial state, parity P_initial = (-1)^L * (1)^2 = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nWhen they emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the process must be conserved. So the parity of the initial state (P_initial) times the parity of X (P_X) should equal the parity of the final NN state (P_final) times the parity of the emitted particle's state (P_X_final). Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nWait, more accurately: the total parity before and after emission must be the same, assuming parity is conserved. So P_initial = P_final * P_X. Because the system (NN) emits X, so their combined parity must be the same before and after.\n\nThe initial parity is P_initial = (\u22121)^{L_initial} * (intrinsic parity)^2. Since both nucleons have intrinsic parity +1, (intrinsic parity)^2 = +1. L_initial is 0 (S state), so P_initial = (+1)^0 * 1 = +1.\n\nAfter emission, the parity is P_final * P_X. P_final is the parity of the final NN state, which is (\u22121)^{L_final} * (intrinsic parity)^2. Again, (intrinsic parity)^2 = +1. So P_final = (\u22121)^{L_final}.\n\nThe emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is (\u22121)^{L_X} * (\u22121), where L_X is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of X. Wait, no. Wait, the parity of a particle is a combination of its intrinsic parity and the orbital part. So the parity is P_X = (\u22121)^{L_X} * (intrinsic parity of X). Since the problem says the intrinsic parity of X is -1, P_X = (-1)^{L_X} * (-1).\n\nPutting it all together, the parity conservation equation is:\n\nP_initial = P_final * P_X\n\nSo:\n\n1 = [ (\u22121)^{L_final} ] * [ (\u22121)^{L_X} * (-1) ]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n(\u22121)^{L_final} * (\u22121)^{L_X} * (-1) = (\u22121)^{L_final + L_X} * (-1)\n\nSo,\n\n1 = (\u22121)^{L_final + L_X} * (-1)\n\nMultiply both sides by (-1):\n\n-1 = (\u22121)^{L_final + L_X}\n\nWhich implies that (\u22121)^{L_final + L_X} = -1 \u2192 L_final + L_X must be odd.\n\nSo L_final + L_X is odd \u2192 L_final and L_X have opposite parities.\n\nNow, the final NN state's L is given in each option. Let's look at each option.\n\nEach option gives the final state as something like 7D1. The part after the arrow is the NN state and the emitted particle. So for example, option A: 1S0 \u21927D1 + p. The 7D1 refers to the NN state, I think. Wait, the notation might be a bit unclear, but I think the part after the arrow is the final state of the NN system plus the emitted particle.\n\nWait, in the options, the format is 1S0 \u2192 (NN state) + (particle). So for option A, the NN state is 7D1. So the L_final for the NN state is D, which is L=2. Because D corresponds to L=2.\n\nSo L_final for option A is 2. Then, X in option A is p, which is a particle. So the emitted particle is a proton. Wait, but the parity of X is intrinsic parity -1, but for a pion (maybe X is a pion?), but wait, the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1, but the options have p, s, f, etc. Hmm, p is a proton. Wait, but a proton has intrinsic parity +1, not -1. Wait, maybe X is a pion? Or perhaps the options have a typo. Wait, but the question says X has intrinsic parity -1. So perhaps in the options, the emitted particle's letter refers to its orbital angular momentum, not the particle type. Let me think.\n\nWait, the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is denoted by the lowercase letter. So, for example, in option A, the emitted particle is p, which I think refers to the orbital angular momentum l=1 (p state). So the L_X is 1.\n\nSo for each option:\n\nOption A: NN state is 7D1 \u2192 L_final=2. X is p \u2192 L_X=1.\n\nSo L_final + L_X = 2 +1=3 \u2192 odd. So parity is conserved.\n\nNow, check the Pauli condition for the NN state.\n\nThe NN final state has T=0.\n\nSo the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L = 1 mod 2.\n\nSo for each option, we need to find the possible S and L for the NN state.\n\nBut wait, the NN state in each option is given as, for example, 7D1. Wait, 7D1 would be (2S+1)L(J), so 7 is (2S+1), so 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3. L is D \u2192 L=2. J is 1. So for option A, the final NN state has S=3, L=2, J=1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the initial NN state has J=0. So how does J change? Oh, because when emitting a particle, the angular momentum of the NN system could change, but the total angular momentum must be conserved. Wait, but the initial J is 0, so the final J of the NN system plus the angular momentum of the emitted particle must sum to J=0.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the angular momentum carried away by the emitted particle. Hmm, maybe the initial J is zero, so the emitted particle must carry away some angular momentum, which would require that the NN system's J plus the X's angular momentum equals the initial J, which is zero. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is more about the selection rules based on the Pauli condition and parity conservation, rather than the detailed angular momentum addition. Let me focus on that.\n\nSo, for each option, we can determine S and L for the NN state, then see if they satisfy S + L \u22611 mod 2 (since T=0).\n\nOption A: NN state is 7D1 \u2192 (2S+1)=7 \u2192 S=3. L=2 (D). So S=3 (odd), L=2 (even). So S + L = 3+2=5 \u2192 1 mod 2. So condition is satisfied. So this is allowed.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p \u2192 The NN state is 3S1. So (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L=0 (S). So S=1 (odd), L=0 (even). S+L=1 \u2192 1 mod 2. Condition is satisfied. So this is allowed.\n\nOption C: 3D3 + f \u2192 NN state is 3D3. (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L=2 (D). S=1 (odd), L=2 (even). S+L=3 \u2192 1 mod 2. Condition is satisfied. So allowed.\n\nOption D: 3P0 + s \u2192 NN state is 3P0. (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L=1 (P). S=1 (odd), L=1 (odd). S + L = 2 \u2192 0 mod 2. So condition is 0=1 mod 2? No, that would be 0=1, which is false. So this option would not satisfy the Pauli condition. So this partial wave is not permitted.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check each step again. For option D, the NN state is 3P0. So S=1, L=1. So S + L = 2 \u2192 even, which is 0 mod 2. The condition is that S + L should be 1 mod 2. So 0 is not equal to 1 mod 2. Therefore, option D doesn't satisfy the condition. So the partial wave in option D is not permitted.\n\nAdditionally, let's check the parity condition for each option.\n\nEarlier, we found that L_final + L_X must be odd.\n\nOption D: L_final is 1 (P), X is s \u2192 L_X=0.\n\nSo 1 + 0=1 \u2192 odd. So parity condition is satisfied. But the Pauli condition is not, so option D is not allowed.\n\nSo the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer would be option D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The two nucleons (NN) are in the 1S0 state. Breaking down the term symbol, this implies:\n   - Total spin \\( S = 0 \\),\n   - Orbital angular momentum \\( L = 0 \\),\n   - Total angular momentum \\( J = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Final State**: The NN system emits a particle \\( X \\) with intrinsic parity \\( -1 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. So, I remember that parity is a quantum number, and particles have intrinsic parities. For example, mesons like pions have certain parities. But wait, particle X here has parity -1, so it's a pseudoscalar maybe?\n\nPauli statistics come into play here. Oh right, Pauli's exclusion principle says that identical fermions can't have the same set of quantum numbers. But wait, in this context, the question is about the conservation of angular momentum and parity, so maybe that's a red herring. The note says that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. I'm not entirely sure about that formula, but I'll keep it in mind.\n\nThe problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, I guess the isospin of the two nucleons is zero. Now, the options are about different partial waves emitted, each with their own angular momentum state.\n\nI need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on angular momentum and parity conservation.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that term symbol. The notation is (2S+1)L(J). So, 1S0 means 2(0)+1=1, so S=0. L is S, so L=0. J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWhen the two nucleons emit a particle X, they go into a final state. Let's denote the final state of the NN as T, S, L, and J. Wait, but the problem says that the final NN state has T=0. Also, the question is about the allowed partial waves, which relate to the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.\n\nWait, no, the options are about the angular momentum state of X. Each option is like 7D1, which is a specific angular momentum state for X. So each option represents the emission of a particle X with a certain L and S. But wait, the term for X is given, like 7D1: that's (2S+1)L. So for X, the term is (2s+1)L, where s is the spin, L the orbital angular momentum.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial state is NN in 1S0. So S=0, L=0, J=0. They emit a particle X, so the process is NN \u2192 NN' + X. Wait, no, more accurately, the initial state is the two nucleons bound together, and they emit a particle, so the final state is the two nucleons (maybe in a different state) plus X.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the final NN state has T=0.\" So the isospin of the NN system is zero. Hmm.\n\nBut the question is about the partial wave of X, so for each option, X has a specific L. Wait, no, the options are the terms for X, so for each option, X has certain L and S. Because the term is given as (2s+1)L.\n\nWait, the options are about the possible final states of X. For example, option A is 7D1, which means (2s+1)=7, so s=3, and L=2 (since D is L=2). So X has spin s=3 and orbital angular momentum L=2 in this case.\n\nWait, but what about the parity? The parity of X is given as -1. The intrinsic parity of X is -1. So the parity of X is (-1)^(L+s) times the intrinsic parity. Wait, no, the parity of a particle is (-1)^{L + S}, because parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So parity P = (-1)^{L + S} * intrinsic parity.\n\nWait, no, the intrinsic parity is just a value, like for a scalar particle it's +1, pseudoscalar is -1. But when you have a composite system, the total parity is the product of the intrinsic parity of each particle times (-1)^{L}, where L is the orbital angular momentum between them. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nAlternatively, when a particle is emitted, the parity of the emitted particle includes its own intrinsic parity and the orbital angular momentum's contribution. But I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. So, the parity of X is (-1) multiplied by (-1)^L, because when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum L contributes a (-1)^L factor to the parity. Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, no, the parity of a particle in a certain state is given by the product of its intrinsic parity and (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. So for a particle X in an orbital state with angular momentum L, its parity is P_X = intrinsic_parity_X * (-1)^L.\n\nSo, in this case, intrinsic_parity_X is -1, so P_X = (-1) * (-1)^L = (-1)^{L+1}.\n\nBut wait, how does this relate to the process? The initial state has a certain parity, and the final state must have the same parity, so parity must be conserved.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. Let's find its parity. The parity of a state with orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So for 1S0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nIn the final state, the parity is the product of the parity of the NN' system and the parity of X. But wait, the NN' system is emitting X. So the parity of the final state (NN' + X) must be the same as the initial parity. So parity conservation: P_initial = P_final.\n\nThe initial parity is +1.\n\nThe final parity is P_NN' * P_X.\n\nBut wait, the NN' system is in a state with their own parity, and X has its own parity. So, P_initial = P_NN' * P_X.\n\nBut the problem doesn't give the state of the NN' system, so perhaps that's a dead end. Alternatively, maybe the parity of the NN' system is the same as the initial state because they're emitting a particle. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the total angular momentum and isospin, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe problem says that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So T = S + L + 1 mod 2.\n\nThe final NN state has T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which implies that S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parity. If S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but what are S and L for the NN state? The initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. So after emission, the final NN state could have different S and L, but T is zero.\n\nWait, but the emission process might change the NN's state. So perhaps the NN after emitting X are in a state with different S and L, but their isospin T must be zero.\n\nBut perhaps I should focus on the emitted particle X's properties and how they affect the overall parity and angular momentum.\n\nEach option gives a term for X, which tells us its spin and orbital angular momentum. For example, option A is 7D1. 7 is (2s+1)=7, so s=3. D is L=2. So X has s=3, L=2. So the parity of X is intrinsic_parity_X * (-1)^L. Since intrinsic_parity_X is -1, parity P_X is (-1) * (-1)^2 = (-1)(1) = -1.\n\nBut wait, the parity of X is given as -1. So that's consistent. Hmm, but maybe that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, the initial state has parity +1. The final state is the NN' system plus X. So the parity of the final state should be the product of the parity of the NN' and the parity of X.\n\nBut I don't know the parity of the NN' system. Hmm. Maybe I should think about the angular momentum instead.\n\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial angular momentum is J=0 (since it's 1S0). The final state must have a total angular momentum of 0 as well.\n\nThe final state includes the NN' system and the emitted particle X. Let's denote the NN' system's angular momentum as J_NN', and X's angular momentum as j_X. Then, J_total = J_NN' + j_X must be zero. But wait, angular momentum is a vector, so the sum must be zero vectorially, not just quantum mechanically adding to zero. So J_NN' and j_X must be such that their vector sum is zero. That implies that J_NN' and j_X are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So J_NN' = j_X. But since angular momentum is quantized, this can only happen if J_NN' = j_X, but their directions are opposite. But in quantum terms, that would mean that their individual quantum numbers add to zero. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the total angular momentum J of the system (NN' + X) must be zero. So J_NN' + J_X = 0. But angular momentum is vectorial, so |J_NN'| = |J_X| and their directions are opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, the only way this can happen is if J_NN' = J_X, but opposite in direction. But for two particles, their total J can be zero only if their individual Js are such that their sum can cancel out.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of conservation of angular momentum. The initial total angular momentum is J=0. So the sum of the angular momenta of the NN' and X must be zero. So the possible states are those where the orbital angular momentum and spin of X combine with the NN' state's angular momentum to give J=0.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to consider the orbital angular momentum of X. Let me think about the orbital angular momentum L of X in each option.\n\nEach option gives the term for X. For example, option A is 7D1. D is L=2. So X has L=2.\n\nThe orbital angular momentum L of X would contribute to the total angular momentum. So the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the process.\n\nBut the initial state's angular momentum is zero, so the total angular momentum after emission must also be zero. So the sum of the NN' system's angular momentum and X's angular momentum must be zero. That means that the orbital angular momentum of X (L_X) must be equal and opposite to the NN' system's orbital angular momentum (L_NN'). But wait, I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the initial angular momentum is zero, the total angular momentum after emission must also be zero. So the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN' system and X must be zero. But I'm not sure if that's the case because the NN' system could have their own orbital angular momentum, but perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is relative to the NN' system.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is between the two nucleons. So the orbital angular momentum of X is L_X, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system is L_NN'. But in the center-of-mass frame, the total orbital angular momentum would be L_X + L_NN', but wait, no. Because the NN' system is the parent, and X is emitted. So the orbital angular momentum of X is the relative angular momentum between the two nucleons. So perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is the same as the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system, but in opposite direction? I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nMaybe I should think about the possible L and S of X and see which ones don't satisfy the conservation laws.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider each option and see if they violate any conservation laws.\n\nThe initial state has J=0. The final state must also have J=0. The total angular momentum is the sum of the angular momentum of the NN' system (J_NN') and the angular momentum of X (j_X). So J_NN' + j_X = 0.\n\nBut j_X includes both the orbital angular momentum (L_X) and the spin (s_X) of X. Similarly, J_NN' includes their orbital angular momentum (L_NN') and spin (S_NN').\n\nWait, but in the process of emitting X, the orbital angular momentum of X is the same as the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system. Hmm, maybe. Because the two nucleons were in an orbital state L, and when they emit X, their relative orbital angular momentum becomes the orbital angular momentum of X. So L_X = L_NN'.\n\nWait, perhaps that's correct. So L_X = L_NN'. So the orbital angular momentum of X is equal to the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system.\n\nIn that case, the total angular momentum of the system would be the sum of the NN' system's angular momentum (J_NN' = S_NN' + L_NN') and X's angular momentum (j_X = s_X + L_X). Since L_X = L_NN', their sum is (S_NN' + L_NN') + (s_X + L_NN') ) = S_NN' + 2 L_NN' + s_X.\n\nBut the total J must be zero, so S_NN' + 2 L_NN' + s_X must be zero. Hmm, but that seems complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nWait, another approach: the orbital angular momentum of X is L, which comes from the relative motion between the two nucleons. So when the two nucleons emit X, their relative orbital angular momentum is L, which becomes the orbital angular momentum of X. So in the final state, the NN' system has orbital angular momentum L (same as X's L), but in the opposite direction? No, because if the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the final orbital angular momentum would have to sum to zero as well.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not correct. The initial state's orbital angular momentum is L=0. The final state's orbital angular momentum for the NN' system plus that of X must be zero. So L_NN' + L_X = 0. So L_X = - L_NN'. But since angular momentum is quantized in integer values, L_X must equal L_NN' in magnitude but opposite in direction. But for quantized values, that would require that L_X = L_NN', but I'm not sure if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is L, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system is zero because the emission process doesn't change the orbital angular momentum. Hmm, but that might not be the case.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think about the parity first.\n\nThe initial state has parity +1. The final state's parity is the product of the parity of the NN' system and the parity of X. So P_initial = P_NN' * P_X.\n\nWe know P_initial is +1, so P_NN' * P_X must be +1. So P_NN' = P_X.\n\nNow, the parity of X is intrinsic_parity_X multiplied by (-1)^L_X, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum of X. Since intrinsic_parity_X is -1, P_X = (-1) * (-1)^L_X = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.\n\nSo P_X = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.\n\nThe parity of the NN' system, P_NN', is (-1)^L_NN', since parity is determined by orbital angular momentum.\n\nSo from P_NN' * P_X = +1, we have:\n\n(-1)^L_NN' * (-1)^{L_X + 1} = 1.\n\nWhich simplifies to (-1)^{L_NN' + L_X + 1} = 1.\n\nWhich means that L_NN' + L_X + 1 must be even. So L_NN' + L_X must be odd.\n\nBut earlier, we had that L_X = L_NN' (since the orbital angular momentum is the same for both systems?), or maybe L_X = - L_NN'? Hmm, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The initial orbital angular momentum is zero. The final orbital angular momentum must also sum to zero. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system plus that of X must be zero. So L_NN' + L_X = 0. So L_X = - L_NN'. But since L is a magnitude, that would mean L_X = L_NN', but opposite in direction. But in quantum terms, the magnitude is what matters for conservation, but the direction must be opposite. So in terms of quantum numbers, L_NN' and L_X must be such that their vector sum is zero, which implies that L_NN' = L_X, but opposite in direction. But in terms of quantum numbers, their magnitudes are the same. So L_NN' = L_X.\n\nWait, but then L_NN' + L_X = 0 would require that their magnitudes are equal but opposite. So in terms of addition, their sum would be zero. So L_NN' = L_X. Because, for example, if L_NN' is 1 and L_X is 1, but in opposite directions, their sum is zero.\n\nSo in that case, L_NN' = L_X.\n\nSo going back to the parity equation: L_NN' + L_X must be odd.\n\nBut if L_NN' = L_X, then L_NN' + L_X = 2 L_NN', which is even. So 2 L_NN' +1 (from earlier) must be even. So 2 L_NN' is even, so 2 L_NN' +1 is odd. So that would make (-1)^(odd) = -1, but the equation requires it to be 1. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the parity equation.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nP_NN' * P_X = 1.\n\nP_NN' = (-1)^L_NN'.\n\nP_X = (-1)^{L_X +1}.\n\nSo (-1)^L_NN' * (-1)^{L_X +1} = 1.\n\nWhich is (-1)^{L_NN' + L_X +1} = 1.\n\nWhich implies that L_NN' + L_X +1 is even.\n\nSo L_NN' + L_X must be odd.\n\nBut if L_NN' = L_X (as from the angular momentum conservation), then L_NN' + L_X = 2 L_NN', which is even. So 2 L_NN' is even. So even +1 is odd. So (-1)^{odd} = -1. But the equation requires it to be +1. So that's a problem. Contradiction.\n\nHmm, that suggests that our assumption that L_NN' = L_X might be incorrect. Or perhaps that parity is not conserved. But that can't be because parity is a conserved quantity in this scenario.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that L_NN' and L_X are equal. Because the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the sum of the NN' and X's orbital angular momenta must be zero. So L_NN' + L_X = 0. So L_X = - L_NN'.\n\nBut since L is a magnitude, it can't be negative. So perhaps L_X = L_NN', but their directions are opposite. But when considering quantum numbers, L is a non-negative integer, so L_NN' and L_X must have the same magnitude but opposite direction.\n\nBut how does that affect the parity equation? Let's substitute L_X = L_NN' into the parity equation.\n\nWait, no, L_X is the orbital angular momentum of X, and L_NN' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system. So if their sum is zero, L_X = - L_NN'. But since L is a magnitude, that implies L_X = L_NN'.\n\nSo L_NN' + L_X = L_NN' + L_NN' = 2 L_NN'.\n\nWhich is even, as before.\n\nSo parity equation: L_NN' + L_X +1 = even.\n\nBut 2 L_NN' +1 is odd. So (-1)^(odd) = -1, which doesn't equal 1.\n\nThat's a problem. So this suggests that parity isn't conserved, which can't be the case. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X isn't the same as that of the NN' system. Because when the two nucleons emit X, their orbital angular momentum could change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is determined by the process, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system is determined by the initial state.\n\nWait, the initial orbital angular momentum is zero. So when they emit X, the orbital angular momentum of X must be zero as well. Because if the initial L is zero, the final L must also be zero. So L_X = 0.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the sum of the final orbital angular momenta must be zero. So the orbital angular momentum of X would have to be zero. Because if the NN' system has orbital angular momentum L, then X must have L_X such that L_NN' + L_X = 0. But the initial L is zero, so the final L must also be zero. So L_NN' + L_X =0. But if L_NN' is non-zero, then L_X must be the opposite, but that would require that their sum is zero. But if the initial L is zero, perhaps the final L must also be zero. So L_NN' = 0 and L_X =0.\n\nWait, but that's only possible if both have L=0. So perhaps X must have L=0.\n\nBut looking at the options, all the options have X in different L states. For example, option A is D, which is L=2. So if X must have L=0, then options A, C, D are invalid. Wait, but option D is 3P0. P is L=1. So that would have L=1, which is also not zero.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the initial state is L=0, so the orbital angular momentum of X must be zero. So only options with L=0 would be allowed. But looking at the options, none of them have L=0. Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1S0 \u21927D1 + p \u2192 X is 7D1 \u2192 L=2.\n\nB) 1S0 \u21923S1 + p \u2192 X is 3S1 \u2192 L=0.\n\nC) 1S0 \u21923D3 + f \u2192 X is 3D3 \u2192 L=2.\n\nD) 1S0 \u21923P0 + s \u2192 X is 3P0 \u2192 L=1.\n\nSo only option B has X with L=0. So that would be allowed. The others have X with L=1 or 2, which would violate the conservation of angular momentum because L_initial is zero.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system is zero, so X's orbital angular momentum must also be zero. So only option B is allowed, and the others are not. But the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer would be the options where X has L not equal to zero.\n\nWait, but the options are about the emitted particle X, and the question is which is not permitted. So if X must have L=0, then options A, C, D are not permitted, but only option B is allowed. But the question is asking which is not permitted, so perhaps all except B are invalid. But the options are A to D, and the question says which is not permitted, implying only one is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my assumption. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial state's orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of the final orbital angular momenta must be zero. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system plus that of X must be zero. So L_NN' + L_X =0. But since L is a magnitude, this can only happen if L_NN' = L_X =0. Because any non-zero L would require the other to be the same, but opposite in direction, which in quantum terms would mean that their sum is zero vectorially only if they're the same magnitude but opposite direction. But in terms of magnitudes, L_NN' and L_X must be equal. So for their sum to be zero, L_NN' must equal L_X, and their directions opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, the sum would then be zero only if their magnitudes are zero.\n\nWait, no. For example, if L_NN' is 1 and L_X is 1, but in opposite directions, their vector sum is zero. So their magnitudes are equal, but directions opposite. So in that case, L_NN' = L_X =1.\n\nBut in that case, their sum is zero vectorially, so the total angular momentum is zero, which is allowed.\n\nAh, so my earlier assumption that L must be zero is incorrect. So the orbital angular momentum of X can be non-zero, as long as it's equal and opposite to that of the NN' system.\n\nSo, back to the parity equation. Let me try again.\n\nThe initial parity is +1. The final parity is P_NN' * P_X = +1.\n\nP_NN' = (-1)^{L_NN'}.\n\nP_X = intrinsic_parity_X * (-1)^{L_X}.\n\nIntrinsic_parity_X is given as -1.\n\nSo P_X = (-1) * (-1)^{L_X} = (-1)^{L_X +1}.\n\nSo P_NN' * P_X = (-1)^{L_NN'} * (-1)^{L_X +1} = (-1)^{L_NN' + L_X +1} = +1.\n\nSo the exponent must be even: L_NN' + L_X +1 is even \u2192 L_NN' + L_X is odd.\n\nBut from angular momentum conservation, L_NN' + L_X =0 vectorially. So their magnitudes must be equal and opposite, but in quantum terms, their magnitudes are the same. So L_NN' = L_X.\n\nSo substituting, L_NN' + L_X = 2 L_NN' \u2192 which must be odd.\n\nBut 2 L_NN' is even, so 2 L_NN' +1 is odd. So yes, that satisfies the condition.\n\nSo the parity equation holds as long as L_NN' = L_X and L_NN' is such that 2 L_NN' is even (which it always is). So no problem there.\n\nNow, the other condition is the isospin condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.\n\nThe final NN state has T=0. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L =1 mod 2.\n\nSo S and L must have opposite parity.\n\nBut what are S and L for the NN' system?\n\nS is the total spin of the NN' system, and L is their orbital angular momentum.\n\nBut the NN' system's total angular momentum J is given by J^2 = (S + L)^2 + ... (vector sum), but for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can consider that the NN' system's J is determined by their S and L.\n\nBut perhaps the NN' system's J must combine with X's angular momentum to give a total J=0. So J_NN' + j_X = 0.\n\nj_X is the total angular momentum of X, which is j_X = s_X + L_X.\n\nSo J_NN' must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to j_X.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at each option and see if they satisfy the conditions.\n\nLet's take each option:\n\nOption A: X is 7D1. So s_X =3 (since (2s+1)=7 \u2192 s=3), L_X=2.\n\nSo j_X = s_X + L_X = 3 + 2 =5. But wait, j_X is the total angular momentum, which is the vector sum of s and L. So j_X can be any value from |3-2| to 3+2, i.e., 1 to 5. But for the sake of conservation, perhaps the maximum possible is considered, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe NN' system must have J_NN' = j_X, but opposite in direction. So J_NN' =5.\n\nBut J_NN' is the total angular momentum of the NN' system, which is S + L.\n\nSo J_NN' can be any value from |S - L| to S + L.\n\nBut S and L must satisfy S + L =1 mod 2, since T=0.\n\nSo for option A:\n\nL_X=2 \u2192 L_NN'=2.\n\nSo S + 2 =1 mod 2 \u2192 S= (1-2) mod 2 \u2192 S= (-1) mod 2 \u2192 1.\n\nSo S=1.\n\nSo the NN' system has S=1 and L=2.\n\nSo J_NN' can be from |1-2|=1 to 1+2=3. So J_NN' can be 1,2,3.\n\nBut j_X is 5, so J_NN' must be 5. But 5 is not possible because J_NN' can only be up to 3. So this is impossible. Therefore, option A is not allowed.\n\nWait, that can't be right because j_X is the total angular momentum of X, which is s_X + L_X. But if X's s=3 and L=2, j_X can be any integer from 1 to 5. So perhaps the NN' system's J must be 5. But if the NN' system's J can only be up to 3, that's impossible. So option A is not allowed.\n\nOption B: X is 3S1. So s_X=0 (since (2s+1)=3 \u2192 s=1? Wait, wait, no. (2s+1)=3 \u2192 s=1. Because 2(1)+1=3. So s=1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 3S1: the term is (2s+1)L. So 3S1 \u2192 2s+1=3 \u2192 s=1, L=0 (S state).\n\nSo X has s=1, L=0. So j_X = s + L =1 +0=1.\n\nSo the NN' system's J_NN' must be 1, opposite in direction to j_X. So J_NN' =1.\n\nThe NN' system has J_NN' =1.\n\nJ_NN' is S + L. S and L must satisfy S + L =1 mod 2.\n\nIn this case, L_NN' is L_X=0. So L=0.\n\nSo S +0 =1 mod 2 \u2192 S=1 mod 2 \u2192 S=1,3,5...\n\nBut S is the total spin of two nucleons. Each nucleon is spin-1/2, so the total spin S can be 0 or 1.\n\nSo S=1 is allowed.\n\nSo J_NN' =1, which can be achieved with S=1 and L=0.\n\nSo this is possible. So option B is allowed.\n\nOption C: X is 3D3. So (2s+1)=3 \u2192 s=1. L=2 (D state).\n\nSo s=1, L=2. j_X can be from 1+2=3 to 1+2=3? Wait, no, j_X can be any integer from |1-2|=1 to 3.\n\nSo j_X can be 1,2,3.\n\nThe NN' system's J_NN' must be equal to j_X in magnitude, opposite in direction. So J_NN' = j_X.\n\nSo possible J_NN' values are 1,2,3.\n\nBut J_NN' is also S + L_NN'.\n\nL_NN' = L_X=2.\n\nSo S +2 =1 mod 2 \u2192 S= (1-2) mod 2 \u2192 -1 mod 2 \u2192 1.\n\nSo S=1.\n\nSo J_NN' can be from |1-2|=1 to 3.\n\nSo possible J_NN' values are 1,2,3.\n\nSo if j_X is 3, then J_NN' must be 3, which is allowed.\n\nSo option C is allowed.\n\nOption D: X is 3P0. So (2s+1)=3 \u2192 s=1. L=1 (P state).\n\nj_X can be from 0 to 2. Because |1-1|=0 and 1+1=2.\n\nSo j_X can be 0,1,2.\n\nThe NN' system's J_NN' must be equal to j_X in magnitude, opposite in direction. So J_NN' can be 0,1,2.\n\nBut for J_NN', J = S + L_NN'.\n\nL_NN' = L_X=1.\n\nSo S +1 =1 mod 2 \u2192 S=0 mod 2 \u2192 S=0,2, etc.\n\nBut S can only be 0 or 1 for two spin-1/2 particles. So S=0.\n\nSo J_NN' =0 +1 =1.\n\nBut J_NN' must be equal to j_X. So j_X must be 1.\n\nSo if j_X is 1, then J_NN' is 1, which is allowed.\n\nSo option D is allowed.\n\nWait, but in option D, X has L=1. So L_X=1. So L_NN' =1.\n\nThen, S +1 must be odd (since T=0 requires S + L =1 mod 2). So S +1 is odd \u2192 S is even. So S=0.\n\nSo J_NN' =0 +1=1. So j_X must be 1.\n\nSo yes, possible.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, the only one that is not allowed is option A, because when X has L=2, the NN' system would need to have L=2, and S=1. Then J_NN' would be 1+2=3. But j_X in option A is 5, which would require J_NN' to be 5, which is impossible because S can't be higher than 1 for two nucleons. So option A is not allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about option A, X has s=3 and L=2. So j_X can be from 1 to 5. But the NN' system's J_NN' must be equal to j_X. But for the NN' system, S can be 1 and L=2. So J_NN' can be up to 3. So j_X can't be 5, because J_NN' can't be 5. So option A is impossible.\n\nSo the answer is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. So, I remember that parity is a quantum number, and particles have intrinsic parities. For example, mesons like pions have certain parities. But wait, particle X here has parity -1, so it's a pseudoscalar maybe?\n\nPauli statistics come into play here. Oh right, Pauli's exclusion principle says that identical fermions can't have the same set of quantum numbers. But wait, in this context, the question is about the conservation of angular momentum and parity, so maybe that's a red herring. The note says that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. I'm not entirely sure about that formula, but I'll keep it in mind.\n\nThe problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, I guess the isospin of the two nucleons is zero. Now, the options are about different partial waves emitted, each with their own angular momentum state.\n\nI need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on angular momentum and parity conservation.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that term symbol. The notation is (2S+1)L(J). So, 1S0 means 2(0)+1=1, so S=0. L is S, so L=0. J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWhen the two nucleons emit a particle X, they go into a final state. Let's denote the final state of the NN as T, S, L, and J. Wait, but the problem says that the final NN state has T=0. Also, the question is about the allowed partial waves, which relate to the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.\n\nWait, no, the options are about the angular momentum state of X. Each option is like 7D1, which is a specific angular momentum state for X. So each option represents the emission of a particle X with a certain L and S. But wait, the term for X is given, like 7D1: that's (2S+1)L. So for X, the term is (2s+1)L, where s is the spin, L the orbital angular momentum.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial state is NN in 1S0. So S=0, L=0, J=0. They emit a particle X, so the process is NN \u2192 NN' + X. Wait, no, more accurately, the initial state is the two nucleons bound together, and they emit a particle, so the final state is the two nucleons (maybe in a different state) plus X.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the final NN state has T=0.\" So the isospin of the NN system is zero. Hmm.\n\nBut the question is about the partial wave of X, so for each option, X has a specific L. Wait, no, the options are the terms for X, so for each option, X has certain L and S. Because the term is given as (2s+1)L.\n\nWait, the options are about the possible final states of X. For example, option A is 7D1, which means (2s+1)=7, so s=3, and L=2 (since D is L=2). So X has spin s=3 and orbital angular momentum L=2 in this case.\n\nWait, but what about the parity? The parity of X is given as -1. The intrinsic parity of X is -1. So the parity of X is (-1)^(L+s) times the intrinsic parity. Wait, no, the parity of a particle is (-1)^{L + S}, because parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So parity P = (-1)^{L + S} * intrinsic parity.\n\nWait, no, the intrinsic parity is just a value, like for a scalar particle it's +1, pseudoscalar is -1. But when you have a composite system, the total parity is the product of the intrinsic parity of each particle times (-1)^{L}, where L is the orbital angular momentum between them. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nAlternatively, when a particle is emitted, the parity of the emitted particle includes its own intrinsic parity and the orbital angular momentum's contribution. But I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. So, the parity of X is (-1) multiplied by (-1)^L, because when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum L contributes a (-1)^L factor to the parity. Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, no, the parity of a particle in a certain state is given by the product of its intrinsic parity and (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. So for a particle X in an orbital state with angular momentum L, its parity is P_X = intrinsic_parity_X * (-1)^L.\n\nSo, in this case, intrinsic_parity_X is -1, so P_X = (-1) * (-1)^L = (-1)^{L+1}.\n\nBut wait, how does this relate to the process? The initial state has a certain parity, and the final state must have the same parity, so parity must be conserved.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. Let's find its parity. The parity of a state with orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So for 1S0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nIn the final state, the parity is the product of the parity of the NN' system and the parity of X. But wait, the NN' system is emitting X. So the parity of the final state (NN' + X) must be the same as the initial parity. So parity conservation: P_initial = P_final.\n\nThe initial parity is +1.\n\nThe final parity is P_NN' * P_X.\n\nBut wait, the NN' system is in a state with their own parity, and X has its own parity. So, P_initial = P_NN' * P_X.\n\nBut the problem doesn't give the state of the NN' system, so perhaps that's a dead end. Alternatively, maybe the parity of the NN' system is the same as the initial state because they're emitting a particle. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the total angular momentum and isospin, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe problem says that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So T = S + L + 1 mod 2.\n\nThe final NN state has T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which implies that S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parity. If S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but what are S and L for the NN state? The initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. So after emission, the final NN state could have different S and L, but T is zero.\n\nWait, but the emission process might change the NN's state. So perhaps the NN after emitting X are in a state with different S and L, but their isospin T must be zero.\n\nBut perhaps I should focus on the emitted particle X's properties and how they affect the overall parity and angular momentum.\n\nEach option gives a term for X, which tells us its spin and orbital angular momentum. For example, option A is 7D1. 7 is (2s+1)=7, so s=3. D is L=2. So X has s=3, L=2. So the parity of X is intrinsic_parity_X * (-1)^L. Since intrinsic_parity_X is -1, parity P_X is (-1) * (-1)^2 = (-1)(1) = -1.\n\nBut wait, the parity of X is given as -1. So that's consistent. Hmm, but maybe that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, the initial state has parity +1. The final state is the NN' system plus X. So the parity of the final state should be the product of the parity of the NN' and the parity of X.\n\nBut I don't know the parity of the NN' system. Hmm. Maybe I should think about the angular momentum instead.\n\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial angular momentum is J=0 (since it's 1S0). The final state must have a total angular momentum of 0 as well.\n\nThe final state includes the NN' system and the emitted particle X. Let's denote the NN' system's angular momentum as J_NN', and X's angular momentum as j_X. Then, J_total = J_NN' + j_X must be zero. But wait, angular momentum is a vector, so the sum must be zero vectorially, not just quantum mechanically adding to zero. So J_NN' and j_X must be such that their vector sum is zero. That implies that J_NN' and j_X are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So J_NN' = j_X. But since angular momentum is quantized, this can only happen if J_NN' = j_X, but their directions are opposite. But in quantum terms, that would mean that their individual quantum numbers add to zero. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the total angular momentum J of the system (NN' + X) must be zero. So J_NN' + J_X = 0. But angular momentum is vectorial, so |J_NN'| = |J_X| and their directions are opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, the only way this can happen is if J_NN' = J_X, but opposite in direction. But for two particles, their total J can be zero only if their individual Js are such that their sum can cancel out.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of conservation of angular momentum. The initial total angular momentum is J=0. So the sum of the angular momenta of the NN' and X must be zero. So the possible states are those where the orbital angular momentum and spin of X combine with the NN' state's angular momentum to give J=0.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to consider the orbital angular momentum of X. Let me think about the orbital angular momentum L of X in each option.\n\nEach option gives the term for X. For example, option A is 7D1. D is L=2. So X has L=2.\n\nThe orbital angular momentum L of X would contribute to the total angular momentum. So the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the process.\n\nBut the initial state's angular momentum is zero, so the total angular momentum after emission must also be zero. So the sum of the NN' system's angular momentum and X's angular momentum must be zero. That means that the orbital angular momentum of X (L_X) must be equal and opposite to the NN' system's orbital angular momentum (L_NN'). But wait, I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the initial angular momentum is zero, the total angular momentum after emission must also be zero. So the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN' system and X must be zero. But I'm not sure if that's the case because the NN' system could have their own orbital angular momentum, but perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is relative to the NN' system.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is between the two nucleons. So the orbital angular momentum of X is L_X, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system is L_NN'. But in the center-of-mass frame, the total orbital angular momentum would be L_X + L_NN', but wait, no. Because the NN' system is the parent, and X is emitted. So the orbital angular momentum of X is the relative angular momentum between the two nucleons. So perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is the same as the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system, but in opposite direction? I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nMaybe I should think about the possible L and S of X and see which ones don't satisfy the conservation laws.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider each option and see if they violate any conservation laws.\n\nThe initial state has J=0. The final state must also have J=0. The total angular momentum is the sum of the angular momentum of the NN' system (J_NN') and the angular momentum of X (j_X). So J_NN' + j_X = 0.\n\nBut j_X includes both the orbital angular momentum (L_X) and the spin (s_X) of X. Similarly, J_NN' includes their orbital angular momentum (L_NN') and spin (S_NN').\n\nWait, but in the process of emitting X, the orbital angular momentum of X is the same as the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system. Hmm, maybe. Because the two nucleons were in an orbital state L, and when they emit X, their relative orbital angular momentum becomes the orbital angular momentum of X. So L_X = L_NN'.\n\nWait, perhaps that's correct. So L_X = L_NN'. So the orbital angular momentum of X is equal to the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system.\n\nIn that case, the total angular momentum of the system would be the sum of the NN' system's angular momentum (J_NN' = S_NN' + L_NN') and X's angular momentum (j_X = s_X + L_X). Since L_X = L_NN', their sum is (S_NN' + L_NN') + (s_X + L_NN') ) = S_NN' + 2 L_NN' + s_X.\n\nBut the total J must be zero, so S_NN' + 2 L_NN' + s_X must be zero. Hmm, but that seems complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nWait, another approach: the orbital angular momentum of X is L, which comes from the relative motion between the two nucleons. So when the two nucleons emit X, their relative orbital angular momentum is L, which becomes the orbital angular momentum of X. So in the final state, the NN' system has orbital angular momentum L (same as X's L), but in the opposite direction? No, because if the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the final orbital angular momentum would have to sum to zero as well.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not correct. The initial state's orbital angular momentum is L=0. The final state's orbital angular momentum for the NN' system plus that of X must be zero. So L_NN' + L_X = 0. So L_X = - L_NN'. But since angular momentum is quantized in integer values, L_X must equal L_NN' in magnitude but opposite in direction. But for quantized values, that would require that L_X = L_NN', but I'm not sure if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is L, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system is zero because the emission process doesn't change the orbital angular momentum. Hmm, but that might not be the case.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think about the parity first.\n\nThe initial state has parity +1. The final state's parity is the product of the parity of the NN' system and the parity of X. So P_initial = P_NN' * P_X.\n\nWe know P_initial is +1, so P_NN' * P_X must be +1. So P_NN' = P_X.\n\nNow, the parity of X is intrinsic_parity_X multiplied by (-1)^L_X, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum of X. Since intrinsic_parity_X is -1, P_X = (-1) * (-1)^L_X = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.\n\nSo P_X = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.\n\nThe parity of the NN' system, P_NN', is (-1)^L_NN', since parity is determined by orbital angular momentum.\n\nSo from P_NN' * P_X = +1, we have:\n\n(-1)^L_NN' * (-1)^{L_X + 1} = 1.\n\nWhich simplifies to (-1)^{L_NN' + L_X + 1} = 1.\n\nWhich means that L_NN' + L_X + 1 must be even. So L_NN' + L_X must be odd.\n\nBut earlier, we had that L_X = L_NN' (since the orbital angular momentum is the same for both systems?), or maybe L_X = - L_NN'? Hmm, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The initial orbital angular momentum is zero. The final orbital angular momentum must also sum to zero. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system plus that of X must be zero. So L_NN' + L_X = 0. So L_X = - L_NN'. But since L is a magnitude, that would mean L_X = L_NN', but opposite in direction. But in quantum terms, the magnitude is what matters for conservation, but the direction must be opposite. So in terms of quantum numbers, L_NN' and L_X must be such that their vector sum is zero, which implies that L_NN' = L_X, but opposite in direction. But in terms of quantum numbers, their magnitudes are the same. So L_NN' = L_X.\n\nWait, but then L_NN' + L_X = 0 would require that their magnitudes are equal but opposite. So in terms of addition, their sum would be zero. So L_NN' = L_X. Because, for example, if L_NN' is 1 and L_X is 1, but in opposite directions, their sum is zero.\n\nSo in that case, L_NN' = L_X.\n\nSo going back to the parity equation: L_NN' + L_X must be odd.\n\nBut if L_NN' = L_X, then L_NN' + L_X = 2 L_NN', which is even. So 2 L_NN' +1 (from earlier) must be even. So 2 L_NN' is even, so 2 L_NN' +1 is odd. So that would make (-1)^(odd) = -1, but the equation requires it to be 1. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the parity equation.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nP_NN' * P_X = 1.\n\nP_NN' = (-1)^L_NN'.\n\nP_X = (-1)^{L_X +1}.\n\nSo (-1)^L_NN' * (-1)^{L_X +1} = 1.\n\nWhich is (-1)^{L_NN' + L_X +1} = 1.\n\nWhich implies that L_NN' + L_X +1 is even.\n\nSo L_NN' + L_X must be odd.\n\nBut if L_NN' = L_X (as from the angular momentum conservation), then L_NN' + L_X = 2 L_NN', which is even. So 2 L_NN' is even. So even +1 is odd. So (-1)^{odd} = -1. But the equation requires it to be +1. So that's a problem. Contradiction.\n\nHmm, that suggests that our assumption that L_NN' = L_X might be incorrect. Or perhaps that parity is not conserved. But that can't be because parity is a conserved quantity in this scenario.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that L_NN' and L_X are equal. Because the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the sum of the NN' and X's orbital angular momenta must be zero. So L_NN' + L_X = 0. So L_X = - L_NN'.\n\nBut since L is a magnitude, it can't be negative. So perhaps L_X = L_NN', but their directions are opposite. But when considering quantum numbers, L is a non-negative integer, so L_NN' and L_X must have the same magnitude but opposite direction.\n\nBut how does that affect the parity equation? Let's substitute L_X = L_NN' into the parity equation.\n\nWait, no, L_X is the orbital angular momentum of X, and L_NN' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system. So if their sum is zero, L_X = - L_NN'. But since L is a magnitude, that implies L_X = L_NN'.\n\nSo L_NN' + L_X = L_NN' + L_NN' = 2 L_NN'.\n\nWhich is even, as before.\n\nSo parity equation: L_NN' + L_X +1 = even.\n\nBut 2 L_NN' +1 is odd. So (-1)^(odd) = -1, which doesn't equal 1.\n\nThat's a problem. So this suggests that parity isn't conserved, which can't be the case. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X isn't the same as that of the NN' system. Because when the two nucleons emit X, their orbital angular momentum could change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is determined by the process, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system is determined by the initial state.\n\nWait, the initial orbital angular momentum is zero. So when they emit X, the orbital angular momentum of X must be zero as well. Because if the initial L is zero, the final L must also be zero. So L_X = 0.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the sum of the final orbital angular momenta must be zero. So the orbital angular momentum of X would have to be zero. Because if the NN' system has orbital angular momentum L, then X must have L_X such that L_NN' + L_X = 0. But the initial L is zero, so the final L must also be zero. So L_NN' + L_X =0. But if L_NN' is non-zero, then L_X must be the opposite, but that would require that their sum is zero. But if the initial L is zero, perhaps the final L must also be zero. So L_NN' = 0 and L_X =0.\n\nWait, but that's only possible if both have L=0. So perhaps X must have L=0.\n\nBut looking at the options, all the options have X in different L states. For example, option A is D, which is L=2. So if X must have L=0, then options A, C, D are invalid. Wait, but option D is 3P0. P is L=1. So that would have L=1, which is also not zero.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the initial state is L=0, so the orbital angular momentum of X must be zero. So only options with L=0 would be allowed. But looking at the options, none of them have L=0. Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1S0 \u21927D1 + p \u2192 X is 7D1 \u2192 L=2.\n\nB) 1S0 \u21923S1 + p \u2192 X is 3S1 \u2192 L=0.\n\nC) 1S0 \u21923D3 + f \u2192 X is 3D3 \u2192 L=2.\n\nD) 1S0 \u21923P0 + s \u2192 X is 3P0 \u2192 L=1.\n\nSo only option B has X with L=0. So that would be allowed. The others have X with L=1 or 2, which would violate the conservation of angular momentum because L_initial is zero.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system is zero, so X's orbital angular momentum must also be zero. So only option B is allowed, and the others are not. But the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer would be the options where X has L not equal to zero.\n\nWait, but the options are about the emitted particle X, and the question is which is not permitted. So if X must have L=0, then options A, C, D are not permitted, but only option B is allowed. But the question is asking which is not permitted, so perhaps all except B are invalid. But the options are A to D, and the question says which is not permitted, implying only one is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my assumption. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial state's orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of the final orbital angular momenta must be zero. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system plus that of X must be zero. So L_NN' + L_X =0. But since L is a magnitude, this can only happen if L_NN' = L_X =0. Because any non-zero L would require the other to be the same, but opposite in direction, which in quantum terms would mean that their sum is zero vectorially only if they're the same magnitude but opposite direction. But in terms of magnitudes, L_NN' and L_X must be equal. So for their sum to be zero, L_NN' must equal L_X, and their directions opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, the sum would then be zero only if their magnitudes are zero.\n\nWait, no. For example, if L_NN' is 1 and L_X is 1, but in opposite directions, their vector sum is zero. So their magnitudes are equal, but directions opposite. So in that case, L_NN' = L_X =1.\n\nBut in that case, their sum is zero vectorially, so the total angular momentum is zero, which is allowed.\n\nAh, so my earlier assumption that L must be zero is incorrect. So the orbital angular momentum of X can be non-zero, as long as it's equal and opposite to that of the NN' system.\n\nSo, back to the parity equation. Let me try again.\n\nThe initial parity is +1. The final parity is P_NN' * P_X = +1.\n\nP_NN' = (-1)^{L_NN'}.\n\nP_X = intrinsic_parity_X * (-1)^{L_X}.\n\nIntrinsic_parity_X is given as -1.\n\nSo P_X = (-1) * (-1)^{L_X} = (-1)^{L_X +1}.\n\nSo P_NN' * P_X = (-1)^{L_NN'} * (-1)^{L_X +1} = (-1)^{L_NN' + L_X +1} = +1.\n\nSo the exponent must be even: L_NN' + L_X +1 is even \u2192 L_NN' + L_X is odd.\n\nBut from angular momentum conservation, L_NN' + L_X =0 vectorially. So their magnitudes must be equal and opposite, but in quantum terms, their magnitudes are the same. So L_NN' = L_X.\n\nSo substituting, L_NN' + L_X = 2 L_NN' \u2192 which must be odd.\n\nBut 2 L_NN' is even, so 2 L_NN' +1 is odd. So yes, that satisfies the condition.\n\nSo the parity equation holds as long as L_NN' = L_X and L_NN' is such that 2 L_NN' is even (which it always is). So no problem there.\n\nNow, the other condition is the isospin condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.\n\nThe final NN state has T=0. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L =1 mod 2.\n\nSo S and L must have opposite parity.\n\nBut what are S and L for the NN' system?\n\nS is the total spin of the NN' system, and L is their orbital angular momentum.\n\nBut the NN' system's total angular momentum J is given by J^2 = (S + L)^2 + ... (vector sum), but for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can consider that the NN' system's J is determined by their S and L.\n\nBut perhaps the NN' system's J must combine with X's angular momentum to give a total J=0. So J_NN' + j_X = 0.\n\nj_X is the total angular momentum of X, which is j_X = s_X + L_X.\n\nSo J_NN' must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to j_X.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at each option and see if they satisfy the conditions.\n\nLet's take each option:\n\nOption A: X is 7D1. So s_X =3 (since (2s+1)=7 \u2192 s=3), L_X=2.\n\nSo j_X = s_X + L_X = 3 + 2 =5. But wait, j_X is the total angular momentum, which is the vector sum of s and L. So j_X can be any value from |3-2| to 3+2, i.e., 1 to 5. But for the sake of conservation, perhaps the maximum possible is considered, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe NN' system must have J_NN' = j_X, but opposite in direction. So J_NN' =5.\n\nBut J_NN' is the total angular momentum of the NN' system, which is S + L.\n\nSo J_NN' can be any value from |S - L| to S + L.\n\nBut S and L must satisfy S + L =1 mod 2, since T=0.\n\nSo for option A:\n\nL_X=2 \u2192 L_NN'=2.\n\nSo S + 2 =1 mod 2 \u2192 S= (1-2) mod 2 \u2192 S= (-1) mod 2 \u2192 1.\n\nSo S=1.\n\nSo the NN' system has S=1 and L=2.\n\nSo J_NN' can be from |1-2|=1 to 1+2=3. So J_NN' can be 1,2,3.\n\nBut j_X is 5, so J_NN' must be 5. But 5 is not possible because J_NN' can only be up to 3. So this is impossible. Therefore, option A is not allowed.\n\nWait, that can't be right because j_X is the total angular momentum of X, which is s_X + L_X. But if X's s=3 and L=2, j_X can be any integer from 1 to 5. So perhaps the NN' system's J must be 5. But if the NN' system's J can only be up to 3, that's impossible. So option A is not allowed.\n\nOption B: X is 3S1. So s_X=0 (since (2s+1)=3 \u2192 s=1? Wait, wait, no. (2s+1)=3 \u2192 s=1. Because 2(1)+1=3. So s=1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 3S1: the term is (2s+1)L. So 3S1 \u2192 2s+1=3 \u2192 s=1, L=0 (S state).\n\nSo X has s=1, L=0. So j_X = s + L =1 +0=1.\n\nSo the NN' system's J_NN' must be 1, opposite in direction to j_X. So J_NN' =1.\n\nThe NN' system has J_NN' =1.\n\nJ_NN' is S + L. S and L must satisfy S + L =1 mod 2.\n\nIn this case, L_NN' is L_X=0. So L=0.\n\nSo S +0 =1 mod 2 \u2192 S=1 mod 2 \u2192 S=1,3,5...\n\nBut S is the total spin of two nucleons. Each nucleon is spin-1/2, so the total spin S can be 0 or 1.\n\nSo S=1 is allowed.\n\nSo J_NN' =1, which can be achieved with S=1 and L=0.\n\nSo this is possible. So option B is allowed.\n\nOption C: X is 3D3. So (2s+1)=3 \u2192 s=1. L=2 (D state).\n\nSo s=1, L=2. j_X can be from 1+2=3 to 1+2=3? Wait, no, j_X can be any integer from |1-2|=1 to 3.\n\nSo j_X can be 1,2,3.\n\nThe NN' system's J_NN' must be equal to j_X in magnitude, opposite in direction. So J_NN' = j_X.\n\nSo possible J_NN' values are 1,2,3.\n\nBut J_NN' is also S + L_NN'.\n\nL_NN' = L_X=2.\n\nSo S +2 =1 mod 2 \u2192 S= (1-2) mod 2 \u2192 -1 mod 2 \u2192 1.\n\nSo S=1.\n\nSo J_NN' can be from |1-2|=1 to 3.\n\nSo possible J_NN' values are 1,2,3.\n\nSo if j_X is 3, then J_NN' must be 3, which is allowed.\n\nSo option C is allowed.\n\nOption D: X is 3P0. So (2s+1)=3 \u2192 s=1. L=1 (P state).\n\nj_X can be from 0 to 2. Because |1-1|=0 and 1+1=2.\n\nSo j_X can be 0,1,2.\n\nThe NN' system's J_NN' must be equal to j_X in magnitude, opposite in direction. So J_NN' can be 0,1,2.\n\nBut for J_NN', J = S + L_NN'.\n\nL_NN' = L_X=1.\n\nSo S +1 =1 mod 2 \u2192 S=0 mod 2 \u2192 S=0,2, etc.\n\nBut S can only be 0 or 1 for two spin-1/2 particles. So S=0.\n\nSo J_NN' =0 +1 =1.\n\nBut J_NN' must be equal to j_X. So j_X must be 1.\n\nSo if j_X is 1, then J_NN' is 1, which is allowed.\n\nSo option D is allowed.\n\nWait, but in option D, X has L=1. So L_X=1. So L_NN' =1.\n\nThen, S +1 must be odd (since T=0 requires S + L =1 mod 2). So S +1 is odd \u2192 S is even. So S=0.\n\nSo J_NN' =0 +1=1. So j_X must be 1.\n\nSo yes, possible.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, the only one that is not allowed is option A, because when X has L=2, the NN' system would need to have L=2, and S=1. Then J_NN' would be 1+2=3. But j_X in option A is 5, which would require J_NN' to be 5, which is impossible because S can't be higher than 1 for two nucleons. So option A is not allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about option A, X has s=3 and L=2. So j_X can be from 1 to 5. But the NN' system's J_NN' must be equal to j_X. But for the NN' system, S can be 1 and L=2. So J_NN' can be up to 3. So j_X can't be 5, because J_NN' can't be 5. So option A is impossible.\n\nSo the answer is option A.\n\n\nThe problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the question says we've got a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Oh right, parity is a quantum number, and particles have their own intrinsic parities. So X has parity -1.\n\nThe problem mentions Pauli statistics and some equation: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I remember that for identical particles, the total wavefunction has to be symmetric or antisymmetric based on their spin. Since nucleons are fermions, their combined wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. So the product of spin, spatial (orbital), and any other symmetry parts must account for that.\n\nThe final NN state has T(NN) = 0. T is the isospin, right? So for the initial state, which is 1S0, I think the T is 0 because the 1S0 state is a singlet in isospin. Wait, no, wait. The initial state is 1S0, but after emitting a particle, the NN state's isospin becomes 0. Hmm.\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0, which in terms of quantum numbers: the S0 part is the spin, I think. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean 2S+1 = 1 \u2192 S=0, L=0 (since S is the letter for orbital angular momentum, but here it's S as in the term S0). Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the term symbol notation, the first part is the spin multiplicity. So for 1S0, the 1 means 2S+1=1 \u2192 S=0. The S0 part is the orbital angular momentum. Oh wait, no, the orbital angular momentum is denoted by the letter, like S, P, D, etc. So the term is (2S+1)L, where L is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. So in 1S0, S is spin, L is 0? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, I think the term symbol is (2S+1)L, where S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So for 1S0, the S here is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Wait, that doesn't make sense. No, wait, no: the term symbol is (2S+1)L, where S is the total spin (the sum of the two nucleons' spins), and L is the orbital angular momentum. So for 1S0, 2S+1=1 implies S=0. And the L is denoted by the letter, so S in this case would mean L=0. So the orbital angular momentum is zero. So the initial state has S=0, L=0.\n\nNow, the initial state emits a particle X. So the final state is the NN system plus X. But the problem is about the partial waves allowed for X. So we're looking at the decay of the initial state into the NN system plus X.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the final NN state\" has T(NN) = 0. So after emission, the NN system is in a state with T=0. So the initial state was 1S0, which probably has T=0 as well, but maybe not necessarily. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the isospin part. Let's think about the isospin.\n\nEach nucleon is a fermion with isospin. So for two nucleons, the isospin can combine in certain ways. The initial state is 1S0, which is a singlet state. So in terms of isospin, the initial state would have T=0, right? Because for two nucleons, combining T=1/2 and T=1/2 can give T=0 or T=1. But the 1S0 state is a singlet, so it's T=0. So the initial state's T is 0.\n\nAfter emitting a particle X, the NN system has T=0 as well. So the isospin doesn't change in this process? Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the emission of X doesn't affect the isospin of the NN system, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the NN system's isospin has to change based on the process. Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the Pauli statistics condition given.\n\nThe equation provided is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So T(NN) is the isospin of the final NN state, S(NN) is their total spin, and L(NN) is their orbital angular momentum. So the sum S + L + 1 must equal T mod 2. Since T is 0, let's plug that in.\n\nSo 0 \u2261 S + L + 1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity. Either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.\n\nNow, the initial state is 1S0. So in the initial state, S is 0 (since 2S+1=1) and L is 0 (because the term is S0, so L=0). So initial state has S=0, L=0.\n\nAfter emission, the NN state's S and L could change? Or does the emission affect their quantum numbers? Hmm, perhaps the NN system's spin and orbital angular momentum might change because the emission could carry away some angular momentum.\n\nWait, but the emission of X is a process where the NN system must conserve angular momentum. So the initial angular momentum of the NN system is J_initial = sqrt(L_initial(L_initial+1) + S_initial(S_initial+1)) + ... but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum J is a combination of L and S. But for the initial state, J would be 0 because L=0 and S=0, so J=0.\n\nAfter emission, the NN system's J_final would have to be such that when combined with the angular momentum carried by X, the total is conserved. So the initial angular momentum is zero, so the final state must have zero as well. Wait, that's a good point. Since the initial system is at rest (I think), the total angular momentum after emission must also be zero. So the NN system's angular momentum and X's angular momentum must add up to zero.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the partial waves emitted by X. So the X has a certain orbital angular momentum, say l, which contributes to the angular momentum of the decay. So the orbital angular momentum of X, l, is the same as the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission, but opposite in direction. Because the total must sum to zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the parity as well. The initial state has parity P_initial. The final state's parity is P_final = P_initial * (-1)^L_X, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum of X. Because parity is a multiplicative quantum number, and the parity of X is intrinsic. Wait, the parity of the emitted particle X is given as -1.\n\nWait, parity of a system is the product of the intrinsic parities of the particles and (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So in this case, the initial parity P_initial of the NN system is (-1)^L_initial, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the initial state is 1S0, which is a state with orbital angular momentum L=0, so its parity is (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nWait, the parity of a state with orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So the initial state has L=0, so parity +1.\n\nAfter emission, the NN system has a certain parity, and the emitted particle X has its own parity. The total parity must be conserved. So P_initial = P_final_NN * P_X * (-1)^L_X. Because when a particle is emitted, its intrinsic parity and the orbital angular momentum contribute to the overall parity change.\n\nWait, no, when a particle is emitted, the process is like this: the initial state's parity is equal to the product of the parity of the final state (the NN plus X) and the orbital angular momentum factor. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the decay process.\n\nSo the decay is NN (initial) \u2192 NN (final) + X. The initial parity is P_initial = (+1) for the 1S0 state.\n\nThe final state's parity is P_final = P_NN_final * P_X * (-1)^L_X, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum of X.\n\nBut because parity is conserved, P_initial = P_final \u2192 (+1) = P_NN_final * P_X * (-1)^L_X.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the parity of the initial state is equal to the product of the parities of the final particles multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So:\n\nP_initial = P_NN_final * P_X * (-1)^L_X.\n\nYes, that makes sense because the orbital angular momentum affects the parity. So rearranging, P_NN_final = P_initial / (P_X * (-1)^L_X).\n\nBut wait, P_initial is +1, and P_X is given as -1. So:\n\nP_NN_final = 1 / [ (-1) * (-1)^L_X ) ] = 1 / [ (-1)^{L_X +1} } ]\n\nWhich simplifies to (-1)^{L_X +1}.\n\nAlternatively, P_NN_final = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.\n\nBut the parity of the NN system after emission is also determined by its own L and S. Wait, the parity of the NN system would be (-1)^L_NN, where L_NN is their orbital angular momentum. So P_NN_final = (-1)^{L_NN}.\n\nPutting it together: (-1)^{L_NN} = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.\n\nWhich implies that L_NN \u2261 (L_X + 1) mod 2.\n\nSo L_NN = L_X + 1 mod 2.\n\nWait, because (-1)^a = (-1)^b implies a \u2261 b mod 2.\n\nSo L_NN \u2261 (L_X +1) mod 2.\n\nBut from the Pauli equation given earlier, S(NN) + L(NN) \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nSo S(NN) + L(NN) \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nSo substituting L_NN \u2261 L_X +1 mod 2:\n\nS(NN) + (L_X + 1) \u2261 1 mod 2 \u2192 S(NN) + L_X \u2261 0 mod 2.\n\nSo S(NN) \u2261 L_X mod 2.\n\nHmm, that's an important relation.\n\nNow, each option gives a term for the final NN state. Let's look at each option and see what they imply.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p\nB) 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p\nC) 1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f\nD) 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s\n\nWait, wait. Each option shows the initial state (1S0) going to a new state of the NN plus a particle. The lowercase letter is the angular momentum state of X. So for example, option A is 7D1: D is the orbital angular momentum letter (so L=2 for D), and the number is the spin. Wait, no, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so 7D1 would be S=3 (since 2*3+1=7), L=2 (D), and J=1.\n\nWait, but I'm more interested in the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission and the spin, because that will determine S(NN) and L(NN).\n\nWait, for each option, the final NN state is given. Let's parse each option.\n\nOption A: 7D1. So the term is (2S+1)L(J). So 7D1 \u2192 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3, L=D=2, J=1.\n\nSo for the NN state after emission, S=3, L=2.\n\nSo S(NN) =3, L(NN)=2.\n\nFrom the earlier equation, S + L \u2261 0 mod 2 \u2192 3 +2 =5 \u2192 5 mod 2 is 1. But according to the equation, S + L \u22610. So 1 \u22610 mod 2? That's not possible. So this option would violate the Pauli condition. Hmm, but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the equation is S + L \u22610 mod 2. So 3 + 2 =5 \u2192 5 mod 2 is 1. So 1 \u22610 \u2192 no, that's not allowed. So option A would not satisfy the condition. But wait, I'm not sure if I've parsed the term correctly. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, for the term 7D1: 7 is 2S+1 \u2192 S=3. D is L=2. J is 1.\n\nSo S=3, L=2. So S + L = 5 \u2192 5 mod 2 is 1. But from earlier, S + L \u22610 mod 2. So this would be a problem. So option A would violate the condition. So perhaps this is the forbidden option.\n\nBut let's check other options to be sure.\n\nOption B: 3S1. So (2S+1)L(J) \u2192 3S1. 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is S \u2192 which is L=0. J=1.\n\nSo S=1, L=0.\n\nSo S + L = 1 + 0 =1 \u2192 1 mod 2 is 1. Which should be \u22610. So 1\u22610? No, that's not allowed. So this option is also forbidden.\n\nWait, but wait. Earlier, I thought that the equation is S + L \u22610 mod2. So in this case, 1 +0=1 \u2192 mod2 is 1, which is not 0. So this would be forbidden. But wait, looking back, the equation from the problem is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2.\n\nWait, no, the problem says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Oh, wait, I think I got that wrong earlier. Let me re-express that.\n\nThe equation is T(NN) \u2261 S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.\n\nSo for T=0, 0 \u2261 S + L +1 \u2192 S + L \u22611 mod2.\n\nSo for option B: S=1, L=0 \u2192 1+0=1 \u2192 mod2 is 1. So 1\u22611 \u2192 okay. So this is allowed. So option B is allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought S + L must be 0, but that's wrong. The equation is S + L +1 \u22610 \u2192 S + L \u2261-1 \u22611 mod2. So S + L must be 1 mod2.\n\nSo for option B: S=1, L=0 \u2192 1+0=1 \u2192 1\u22611 \u2192 allowed. So option B is allowed.\n\nOption C: 3D3. So term is (2S+1)L(J) \u2192 3D3. 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L=D=2. J=3.\n\nSo S=1, L=2.\n\nSo S + L = 3 \u2192 3 mod2 is 1. Which matches the condition. So allowed.\n\nOption D: 3P0. So (2S+1)L(J) \u2192 3P0. 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L=P=1. J=0.\n\nSo S=1, L=1. S+L=2 \u2192 mod2 is 0. Which is 0, but our condition is S+L must be 1. So 0\u22601 \u2192 this is not allowed.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's double-check. For option D: S=1, L=1 \u2192 S+L=2 \u2192 0 mod2. So 0 \u22611? No, that's not allowed. So option D is forbidden.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial state is 1S0, which has S=0, L=0. The emitted particle X has some orbital angular momentum l, which is the same as L_X.\n\nWait, but earlier, from the parity condition, we had that L_NN \u2261 L_X +1 mod2.\n\nSo let's compute L_X for each option.\n\nBecause the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l is denoted by the lowercase letter. For example, in option A, the emitted particle is p, which is spin 1/2? Or wait, no, the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So, for example, the options say things like \"p\", \"s\", etc.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X\". So for example, \"p\" would denote l=1, \"s\" is l=0, \"d\" is l=2, \"f\" is l=3, etc.\n\nSo for each option, the emitted X's l is given by the lowercase letter. So let's list them.\n\nOption A: 7D1 + p \u2192 X is p \u2192 l=1.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p \u2192 X is p \u2192 l=1.\n\nOption C: 3D3 + f \u2192 X is f \u2192 l=3.\n\nOption D: 3P0 + s \u2192 X is s \u2192 l=0.\n\nNow, from the parity condition earlier, P_NN_final = (-1)^{L_X +1}.\n\nAnd P_NN_final is also (-1)^{L_NN}.\n\nSo L_NN \u2261 L_X +1 mod2.\n\nSo for each option, let's compute L_NN and see if it matches.\n\nOption A: X has l=1. So L_NN \u2261 1 +1 = 2 mod2 \u2192 0. So L_NN must be even.\n\nIn option A, the NN state is 7D1 \u2192 L_NN=2 (since D is L=2). 2 is even, which matches L_X=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 even. So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nAnd from the Pauli condition, S + L must be 1 mod2. For option A, S=3, L=2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 1 mod2 \u2192 yes, condition is satisfied. So option A is allowed.\n\nOption B: X is p \u2192 l=1. So L_NN must be 1+1=2 mod2 \u2192 0.\n\nIn option B, the NN state is 3S1 \u2192 L=0. So 0 is even. So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nAnd Pauli condition: S=1, L=0 \u2192 1+0=1 \u2192 1 mod2 \u2192 condition met. So allowed.\n\nOption C: X is f \u2192 l=3. So L_NN must be 3+1=4 mod2 \u2192 0.\n\nIn option C, NN state is 3D3 \u2192 L=2, which is even. So condition met.\n\nPauli condition: S=1, L=2 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 1 mod2 \u2192 condition met. So allowed.\n\nOption D: X is s \u2192 l=0. So L_NN must be 0 +1=1 mod2 \u2192 L_NN must be odd.\n\nIn option D, NN state is 3P0 \u2192 L=1 (P is L=1), which is odd. So parity condition is met.\n\nPauli condition: S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 0 mod2. But condition requires 1 mod2. So 0\u22601 \u2192 Pauli condition not met. So this option is forbidden.\n\nWait, so in option D, the Pauli condition is not satisfied. So that's the forbidden option.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought option A had a problem because S + L was 5 mod2=1, which is allowed. So why is the question asking which is not permitted? Let's see.\n\nWait, the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So which option violates either the Pauli condition or the parity condition.\n\nWait, let me check each option again.\n\nOption A:\n\nNN state: S=3, L=2.\n\nPauli condition: 3+2=5 \u2192 1 mod2 \u2192 condition met.\n\nParity: L_NN=2, X's l=1.\n\nP_NN_final = (-1)^2 =1.\n\nP_initial =1.\n\nP_X = -1.\n\nSo 1 = 1 * (-1) * (-1)^1 \u2192 1 = (-1)*(-1) \u2192 1=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo option A is allowed.\n\nOption B:\n\nNN state: S=1, L=0.\n\nPauli condition: 1+0=1 \u2192 condition met.\n\nParity: L_NN=0, X's l=1.\n\nP_NN_final = (-1)^0=1.\n\nEquation: 1 = 1 * (-1) * (-1)^1 \u2192 1 = (1 * (-1) ) * (-1) \u2192 1 = 1 \u2192 correct.\n\nAllowed.\n\nOption C:\n\nNN state: S=1, L=2.\n\nPauli condition: 1+2=3 \u2192 1 mod2 \u2192 condition met.\n\nParity: L_NN=2, X's l=3.\n\nP_NN_final = (-1)^2 =1.\n\nEquation: 1 = 1 * (-1) * (-1)^3 \u2192 (-1)^3 =-1 \u2192 1 = (1 * (-1) ) * (-1) \u2192 1=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nAllowed.\n\nOption D:\n\nNN state: S=1, L=1.\n\nPauli condition: 1+1=2 \u2192 0 mod2. Which doesn't meet the required 1 \u2192 condition not met.\n\nParity: L_NN=1, X's l=0.\n\nP_NN_final = (-1)^1 = -1.\n\nEquation: 1 = (-1) * (-1) * (-1)^0 \u2192 (-1) * (-1) =1, (-1)^0=1 \u2192 1 = 1*1 \u2192 1=1 \u2192 parity condition met.\n\nSo the parity condition is satisfied, but the Pauli condition is not. So option D is forbidden.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought option A was allowed. So the question is which option is not permitted. So the forbidden one is D.\n\nBut wait, let me check each step again because earlier I thought option A had S + L =5 \u2192 1 mod2, which is correct. So option D is the only one violating the Pauli condition. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but looking back, the problem statement says: \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted\". So the partial wave refers to the emitted X's angular momentum, which is denoted by the lowercase letter. So in option D, X is 's' which is l=0. So if the Pauli condition is not met, then that partial wave is not allowed.\n\nSo the answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:\n\n1. **Initial State and Conservation Laws**:  \n   The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in the 1S0 state.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the question says we've got a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Oh right, parity is a quantum number, and particles have their own intrinsic parities. So X has parity -1.\n\nThe problem mentions Pauli statistics and some equation: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I remember that for identical particles, the total wavefunction has to be symmetric or antisymmetric based on their spin. Since nucleons are fermions, their combined wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. So the product of spin, spatial (orbital), and any other symmetry parts must account for that.\n\nThe final NN state has T(NN) = 0. T is the isospin, right? So for the initial state, which is 1S0, I think the T is 0 because the 1S0 state is a singlet in isospin. Wait, no, wait. The initial state is 1S0, but after emitting a particle, the NN state's isospin becomes 0. Hmm.\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0, which in terms of quantum numbers: the S0 part is the spin, I think. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean 2S+1 = 1 \u2192 S=0, L=0 (since S is the letter for orbital angular momentum, but here it's S as in the term S0). Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the term symbol notation, the first part is the spin multiplicity. So for 1S0, the 1 means 2S+1=1 \u2192 S=0. The S0 part is the orbital angular momentum. Oh wait, no, the orbital angular momentum is denoted by the letter, like S, P, D, etc. So the term is (2S+1)L, where L is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. So in 1S0, S is spin, L is 0? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, I think the term symbol is (2S+1)L, where S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So for 1S0, the S here is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Wait, that doesn't make sense. No, wait, no: the term symbol is (2S+1)L, where S is the total spin (the sum of the two nucleons' spins), and L is the orbital angular momentum. So for 1S0, 2S+1=1 implies S=0. And the L is denoted by the letter, so S in this case would mean L=0. So the orbital angular momentum is zero. So the initial state has S=0, L=0.\n\nNow, the initial state emits a particle X. So the final state is the NN system plus X. But the problem is about the partial waves allowed for X. So we're looking at the decay of the initial state into the NN system plus X.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the final NN state\" has T(NN) = 0. So after emission, the NN system is in a state with T=0. So the initial state was 1S0, which probably has T=0 as well, but maybe not necessarily. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the isospin part. Let's think about the isospin.\n\nEach nucleon is a fermion with isospin. So for two nucleons, the isospin can combine in certain ways. The initial state is 1S0, which is a singlet state. So in terms of isospin, the initial state would have T=0, right? Because for two nucleons, combining T=1/2 and T=1/2 can give T=0 or T=1. But the 1S0 state is a singlet, so it's T=0. So the initial state's T is 0.\n\nAfter emitting a particle X, the NN system has T=0 as well. So the isospin doesn't change in this process? Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the emission of X doesn't affect the isospin of the NN system, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the NN system's isospin has to change based on the process. Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the Pauli statistics condition given.\n\nThe equation provided is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So T(NN) is the isospin of the final NN state, S(NN) is their total spin, and L(NN) is their orbital angular momentum. So the sum S + L + 1 must equal T mod 2. Since T is 0, let's plug that in.\n\nSo 0 \u2261 S + L + 1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity. Either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.\n\nNow, the initial state is 1S0. So in the initial state, S is 0 (since 2S+1=1) and L is 0 (because the term is S0, so L=0). So initial state has S=0, L=0.\n\nAfter emission, the NN state's S and L could change? Or does the emission affect their quantum numbers? Hmm, perhaps the NN system's spin and orbital angular momentum might change because the emission could carry away some angular momentum.\n\nWait, but the emission of X is a process where the NN system must conserve angular momentum. So the initial angular momentum of the NN system is J_initial = sqrt(L_initial(L_initial+1) + S_initial(S_initial+1)) + ... but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum J is a combination of L and S. But for the initial state, J would be 0 because L=0 and S=0, so J=0.\n\nAfter emission, the NN system's J_final would have to be such that when combined with the angular momentum carried by X, the total is conserved. So the initial angular momentum is zero, so the final state must have zero as well. Wait, that's a good point. Since the initial system is at rest (I think), the total angular momentum after emission must also be zero. So the NN system's angular momentum and X's angular momentum must add up to zero.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the partial waves emitted by X. So the X has a certain orbital angular momentum, say l, which contributes to the angular momentum of the decay. So the orbital angular momentum of X, l, is the same as the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission, but opposite in direction. Because the total must sum to zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the parity as well. The initial state has parity P_initial. The final state's parity is P_final = P_initial * (-1)^L_X, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum of X. Because parity is a multiplicative quantum number, and the parity of X is intrinsic. Wait, the parity of the emitted particle X is given as -1.\n\nWait, parity of a system is the product of the intrinsic parities of the particles and (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So in this case, the initial parity P_initial of the NN system is (-1)^L_initial, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the initial state is 1S0, which is a state with orbital angular momentum L=0, so its parity is (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nWait, the parity of a state with orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So the initial state has L=0, so parity +1.\n\nAfter emission, the NN system has a certain parity, and the emitted particle X has its own parity. The total parity must be conserved. So P_initial = P_final_NN * P_X * (-1)^L_X. Because when a particle is emitted, its intrinsic parity and the orbital angular momentum contribute to the overall parity change.\n\nWait, no, when a particle is emitted, the process is like this: the initial state's parity is equal to the product of the parity of the final state (the NN plus X) and the orbital angular momentum factor. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the decay process.\n\nSo the decay is NN (initial) \u2192 NN (final) + X. The initial parity is P_initial = (+1) for the 1S0 state.\n\nThe final state's parity is P_final = P_NN_final * P_X * (-1)^L_X, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum of X.\n\nBut because parity is conserved, P_initial = P_final \u2192 (+1) = P_NN_final * P_X * (-1)^L_X.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the parity of the initial state is equal to the product of the parities of the final particles multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So:\n\nP_initial = P_NN_final * P_X * (-1)^L_X.\n\nYes, that makes sense because the orbital angular momentum affects the parity. So rearranging, P_NN_final = P_initial / (P_X * (-1)^L_X).\n\nBut wait, P_initial is +1, and P_X is given as -1. So:\n\nP_NN_final = 1 / [ (-1) * (-1)^L_X ) ] = 1 / [ (-1)^{L_X +1} } ]\n\nWhich simplifies to (-1)^{L_X +1}.\n\nAlternatively, P_NN_final = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.\n\nBut the parity of the NN system after emission is also determined by its own L and S. Wait, the parity of the NN system would be (-1)^L_NN, where L_NN is their orbital angular momentum. So P_NN_final = (-1)^{L_NN}.\n\nPutting it together: (-1)^{L_NN} = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.\n\nWhich implies that L_NN \u2261 (L_X + 1) mod 2.\n\nSo L_NN = L_X + 1 mod 2.\n\nWait, because (-1)^a = (-1)^b implies a \u2261 b mod 2.\n\nSo L_NN \u2261 (L_X +1) mod 2.\n\nBut from the Pauli equation given earlier, S(NN) + L(NN) \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nSo S(NN) + L(NN) \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nSo substituting L_NN \u2261 L_X +1 mod 2:\n\nS(NN) + (L_X + 1) \u2261 1 mod 2 \u2192 S(NN) + L_X \u2261 0 mod 2.\n\nSo S(NN) \u2261 L_X mod 2.\n\nHmm, that's an important relation.\n\nNow, each option gives a term for the final NN state. Let's look at each option and see what they imply.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p\nB) 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p\nC) 1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f\nD) 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s\n\nWait, wait. Each option shows the initial state (1S0) going to a new state of the NN plus a particle. The lowercase letter is the angular momentum state of X. So for example, option A is 7D1: D is the orbital angular momentum letter (so L=2 for D), and the number is the spin. Wait, no, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so 7D1 would be S=3 (since 2*3+1=7), L=2 (D), and J=1.\n\nWait, but I'm more interested in the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission and the spin, because that will determine S(NN) and L(NN).\n\nWait, for each option, the final NN state is given. Let's parse each option.\n\nOption A: 7D1. So the term is (2S+1)L(J). So 7D1 \u2192 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3, L=D=2, J=1.\n\nSo for the NN state after emission, S=3, L=2.\n\nSo S(NN) =3, L(NN)=2.\n\nFrom the earlier equation, S + L \u2261 0 mod 2 \u2192 3 +2 =5 \u2192 5 mod 2 is 1. But according to the equation, S + L \u22610. So 1 \u22610 mod 2? That's not possible. So this option would violate the Pauli condition. Hmm, but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the equation is S + L \u22610 mod 2. So 3 + 2 =5 \u2192 5 mod 2 is 1. So 1 \u22610 \u2192 no, that's not allowed. So option A would not satisfy the condition. But wait, I'm not sure if I've parsed the term correctly. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, for the term 7D1: 7 is 2S+1 \u2192 S=3. D is L=2. J is 1.\n\nSo S=3, L=2. So S + L = 5 \u2192 5 mod 2 is 1. But from earlier, S + L \u22610 mod 2. So this would be a problem. So option A would violate the condition. So perhaps this is the forbidden option.\n\nBut let's check other options to be sure.\n\nOption B: 3S1. So (2S+1)L(J) \u2192 3S1. 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is S \u2192 which is L=0. J=1.\n\nSo S=1, L=0.\n\nSo S + L = 1 + 0 =1 \u2192 1 mod 2 is 1. Which should be \u22610. So 1\u22610? No, that's not allowed. So this option is also forbidden.\n\nWait, but wait. Earlier, I thought that the equation is S + L \u22610 mod2. So in this case, 1 +0=1 \u2192 mod2 is 1, which is not 0. So this would be forbidden. But wait, looking back, the equation from the problem is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2.\n\nWait, no, the problem says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Oh, wait, I think I got that wrong earlier. Let me re-express that.\n\nThe equation is T(NN) \u2261 S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.\n\nSo for T=0, 0 \u2261 S + L +1 \u2192 S + L \u22611 mod2.\n\nSo for option B: S=1, L=0 \u2192 1+0=1 \u2192 mod2 is 1. So 1\u22611 \u2192 okay. So this is allowed. So option B is allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought S + L must be 0, but that's wrong. The equation is S + L +1 \u22610 \u2192 S + L \u2261-1 \u22611 mod2. So S + L must be 1 mod2.\n\nSo for option B: S=1, L=0 \u2192 1+0=1 \u2192 1\u22611 \u2192 allowed. So option B is allowed.\n\nOption C: 3D3. So term is (2S+1)L(J) \u2192 3D3. 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L=D=2. J=3.\n\nSo S=1, L=2.\n\nSo S + L = 3 \u2192 3 mod2 is 1. Which matches the condition. So allowed.\n\nOption D: 3P0. So (2S+1)L(J) \u2192 3P0. 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L=P=1. J=0.\n\nSo S=1, L=1. S+L=2 \u2192 mod2 is 0. Which is 0, but our condition is S+L must be 1. So 0\u22601 \u2192 this is not allowed.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's double-check. For option D: S=1, L=1 \u2192 S+L=2 \u2192 0 mod2. So 0 \u22611? No, that's not allowed. So option D is forbidden.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial state is 1S0, which has S=0, L=0. The emitted particle X has some orbital angular momentum l, which is the same as L_X.\n\nWait, but earlier, from the parity condition, we had that L_NN \u2261 L_X +1 mod2.\n\nSo let's compute L_X for each option.\n\nBecause the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l is denoted by the lowercase letter. For example, in option A, the emitted particle is p, which is spin 1/2? Or wait, no, the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So, for example, the options say things like \"p\", \"s\", etc.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X\". So for example, \"p\" would denote l=1, \"s\" is l=0, \"d\" is l=2, \"f\" is l=3, etc.\n\nSo for each option, the emitted X's l is given by the lowercase letter. So let's list them.\n\nOption A: 7D1 + p \u2192 X is p \u2192 l=1.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p \u2192 X is p \u2192 l=1.\n\nOption C: 3D3 + f \u2192 X is f \u2192 l=3.\n\nOption D: 3P0 + s \u2192 X is s \u2192 l=0.\n\nNow, from the parity condition earlier, P_NN_final = (-1)^{L_X +1}.\n\nAnd P_NN_final is also (-1)^{L_NN}.\n\nSo L_NN \u2261 L_X +1 mod2.\n\nSo for each option, let's compute L_NN and see if it matches.\n\nOption A: X has l=1. So L_NN \u2261 1 +1 = 2 mod2 \u2192 0. So L_NN must be even.\n\nIn option A, the NN state is 7D1 \u2192 L_NN=2 (since D is L=2). 2 is even, which matches L_X=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 even. So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nAnd from the Pauli condition, S + L must be 1 mod2. For option A, S=3, L=2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 1 mod2 \u2192 yes, condition is satisfied. So option A is allowed.\n\nOption B: X is p \u2192 l=1. So L_NN must be 1+1=2 mod2 \u2192 0.\n\nIn option B, the NN state is 3S1 \u2192 L=0. So 0 is even. So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nAnd Pauli condition: S=1, L=0 \u2192 1+0=1 \u2192 1 mod2 \u2192 condition met. So allowed.\n\nOption C: X is f \u2192 l=3. So L_NN must be 3+1=4 mod2 \u2192 0.\n\nIn option C, NN state is 3D3 \u2192 L=2, which is even. So condition met.\n\nPauli condition: S=1, L=2 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 1 mod2 \u2192 condition met. So allowed.\n\nOption D: X is s \u2192 l=0. So L_NN must be 0 +1=1 mod2 \u2192 L_NN must be odd.\n\nIn option D, NN state is 3P0 \u2192 L=1 (P is L=1), which is odd. So parity condition is met.\n\nPauli condition: S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 0 mod2. But condition requires 1 mod2. So 0\u22601 \u2192 Pauli condition not met. So this option is forbidden.\n\nWait, so in option D, the Pauli condition is not satisfied. So that's the forbidden option.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought option A had a problem because S + L was 5 mod2=1, which is allowed. So why is the question asking which is not permitted? Let's see.\n\nWait, the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So which option violates either the Pauli condition or the parity condition.\n\nWait, let me check each option again.\n\nOption A:\n\nNN state: S=3, L=2.\n\nPauli condition: 3+2=5 \u2192 1 mod2 \u2192 condition met.\n\nParity: L_NN=2, X's l=1.\n\nP_NN_final = (-1)^2 =1.\n\nP_initial =1.\n\nP_X = -1.\n\nSo 1 = 1 * (-1) * (-1)^1 \u2192 1 = (-1)*(-1) \u2192 1=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo option A is allowed.\n\nOption B:\n\nNN state: S=1, L=0.\n\nPauli condition: 1+0=1 \u2192 condition met.\n\nParity: L_NN=0, X's l=1.\n\nP_NN_final = (-1)^0=1.\n\nEquation: 1 = 1 * (-1) * (-1)^1 \u2192 1 = (1 * (-1) ) * (-1) \u2192 1 = 1 \u2192 correct.\n\nAllowed.\n\nOption C:\n\nNN state: S=1, L=2.\n\nPauli condition: 1+2=3 \u2192 1 mod2 \u2192 condition met.\n\nParity: L_NN=2, X's l=3.\n\nP_NN_final = (-1)^2 =1.\n\nEquation: 1 = 1 * (-1) * (-1)^3 \u2192 (-1)^3 =-1 \u2192 1 = (1 * (-1) ) * (-1) \u2192 1=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nAllowed.\n\nOption D:\n\nNN state: S=1, L=1.\n\nPauli condition: 1+1=2 \u2192 0 mod2. Which doesn't meet the required 1 \u2192 condition not met.\n\nParity: L_NN=1, X's l=0.\n\nP_NN_final = (-1)^1 = -1.\n\nEquation: 1 = (-1) * (-1) * (-1)^0 \u2192 (-1) * (-1) =1, (-1)^0=1 \u2192 1 = 1*1 \u2192 1=1 \u2192 parity condition met.\n\nSo the parity condition is satisfied, but the Pauli condition is not. So option D is forbidden.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought option A was allowed. So the question is which option is not permitted. So the forbidden one is D.\n\nBut wait, let me check each step again because earlier I thought option A had S + L =5 \u2192 1 mod2, which is correct. So option D is the only one violating the Pauli condition. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but looking back, the problem statement says: \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted\". So the partial wave refers to the emitted X's angular momentum, which is denoted by the lowercase letter. So in option D, X is 's' which is l=0. So if the Pauli condition is not met, then that partial wave is not allowed.\n\nSo the answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:\n\n1. **Initial State and Conservation Laws**:  \n   The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in the 1S0 state. This implies:\n   - Total spin \\( S = 0 \\) (from \\( 2S+1 = 1 \\)).\n   - Orbital angular momentum \\( L = 0 \\) (denoted by the \"S\" in 1S0).\n   - Parity \\( P_{\\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \\).\n\n   After emitting a particle \\( X \\) with intrinsic parity \\( P_X = -1 \\), the NN system transitions to a final state with:\n   - Isospin \\( T(NN) = 0 \\).\n   - Total angular momentum and parity must be conserved.\n\n2. **Pauli Statistics Condition**:  \n   The problem states:\n   \\[\n   T(NN) \\equiv S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\, (\\text{mod } 2).\n   \\]\n   Since \\( T(NN) = 0 \\), this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   S(NN) + L(NN) \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod } 2).\n   \\]\n   Thus, the sum of the total spin and orbital angular momentum of the final NN state must be odd.\n\n3. **Parity Conservation**:  \n   The parity of the final state is given by:\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{final}} = P_{\\text{NN, final}} \\cdot P_X \\cdot (-1)^{L_X},\n   \\]\n   where \\( L_X \\) is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle \\( X \\). Since \\( P_{\\text{initial}} = P_{\\text{final}} \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{NN, final}} = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.\n   \\]\n   Additionally, the parity of the NN system is \\( P_{\\text{NN, final}} = (-1)^{L_{\\text{NN}}} \\), where \\( L_{\\text{NN}} \\) is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state. Equating these:\n   \\[\n   (-1)^{L_{\\text{NN}}} = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   L_{\\text{NN}} \\equiv L_X + 1 \\, (\\text{mod } 2).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Analysis of Each Option**:  \n   For each option, we determine \\( S(NN) \\), \\( L(NN) \\), and \\( L_X \\) from the given final NN state and the emitted particle \\( X \\). We then check whether the Pauli condition \\( S(NN) + L(NN) \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod } 2) \\) is satisfied.\n\n   - **Option A: \\( 1S0 \\to 7D1 + p \\)**  \n     - Final NN state: \\( 7D1 \\).  \n       \\( S(NN) = 3 \\) (from \\( 2S+1 = 7 \\)), \\( L(NN) = 2 \\) (denoted by \"D\").  \n     - Emitted particle: \\( p \\), \\( L_X = 1 \\).  \n     - Pauli condition: \\( S(NN) + L(NN) = 3 + 2 = 5 \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod } 2) \\).  \n     - Parity condition: \\( L_{\\text{NN}} = 2 \\equiv L_X + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\, (\\text{mod } 2) \\).  \n     - **Allowed**.\n\n   - **Option B: \\( 1S0 \\to 3S1 + p \\)**  \n     - Final NN state: \\( 3S1 \\).  \n       \\( S(NN) = 1 \\) (from \\( 2S+1 = 3 \\)), \\( L(NN) = 0 \\) (denoted by \"S\").  \n     - Emitted particle: \\( p \\), \\( L_X = 1 \\).  \n     - Pauli condition: \\( S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod } 2) \\).  \n     - Parity condition: \\( L_{\\text{NN}} = 0 \\equiv L_X + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\equiv 0 \\, (\\text{mod } 2) \\).  \n     - **Allowed**.\n\n   - **Option C: \\( 1S0 \\to 3D3 + f \\)**  \n     - Final NN state: \\( 3D3 \\).  \n       \\( S(NN) = 1 \\) (from \\( 2S+1 = 3 \\)), \\( L(NN) = 2 \\) (denoted by \"D\").  \n     - Emitted particle: \\( f \\), \\( L_X = 3 \\).  \n     - Pauli condition: \\( S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 2 = 3 \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod } 2) \\).  \n     - Parity condition: \\( L_{\\text{NN}} = 2 \\equiv L_X + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 \\equiv 0 \\, (\\text{mod } 2) \\).  \n     - **Allowed**.\n\n   - **Option D: \\( 1S0 \\to 3P0 + s \\)**  \n     - Final NN state: \\( 3P0 \\).  \n       \\( S(NN) = 1 \\) (from \\( 2S+1 = 3 \\)), \\( L(NN) = 1 \\) (denoted by \"P\").  \n     - Emitted particle: \\( s \\), \\( L_X = 0 \\).  \n     - Pauli condition: \\( S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 1 = 2 \\equiv 0 \\, (\\text{mod } 2) \\).  \n       This violates the condition \\( S(NN) + L(NN) \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod } 2) \\).  \n     - **Forbidden**.\n\n**Conclusion**: The partial wave corresponding to Option D is not permitted because it violates the Pauli condition. \n\nANSWER: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem states that we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, which I think relates to the symmetry of the wavefunction. The equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, not entirely sure what that means yet.\n\nThe final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I remember that isospin T is like a quantum number similar to spin, but for nuclei. So if T is 0, that implies the system is in a singlet state.\n\nThe question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from the initial state to a final state plus a particle. The particles emitted are denoted by lowercase letters: p, s, f, etc., which probably stand for pion (p), something else maybe (s?), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, wait\u2014particle X is the one being emitted. So the options are the initial state (1S0) going to another state plus X. The letters after the plus probably denote the type of particle X. So like, in option A, it's 7D1 plus p, meaning X is a pion, maybe.\n\nWait, but the problem says that X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is negative. I remember that for particles like pions, their intrinsic parity is indeed negative. So X is a pion perhaps, but the options don't all say p. Wait, the options vary: option B is p, option C is f, D is s. Hmm, maybe p stands for pion, s for something else, but I'm not too sure. Maybe it's not important for the problem.\n\nThe main point is about conservation of angular momentum and parity. The initial state is 1S0. Let's parse that. The notation is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0 means 2S+1 =1, so S=0. L is S (but wait, no, L is the orbital angular momentum). Wait, the term is written as (2S+1)L J. So 1S0: S=0, L=0 (since S is the spectroscopic symbol for L=0), and J=0. So initial state is S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWhen they emit X, the final NN state (which is after emission) must have certain quantum numbers. Let's think about the process: the initial NN is 1S0, then they emit X, so the final NN state must combine with X's state to conserve angular momentum and parity.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the Pauli statistics, so the symmetry of the wavefunction under exchange of the two nucleons. Since the two nucleons are identical fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts. So the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric.\n\nThe equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, I'm not sure I get that. So T is the isospin quantum number, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So T = S + L +1 mod 2. So their sum plus 1 must be even or odd, depending on T.\n\nThe final state has T=0. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which implies S + L +1 is even, so S + L is odd. Because 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2 \u2192 S + L +1 is even \u2192 S + L is odd.\n\nSo for the final NN state, S + L must be odd. Let me remember that for each option, I'll have to find the S and L of the final state to see if this condition holds.\n\nWait, no. The problem is about the final NN state after emission. So when the NN system emits X, the final NN state has certain quantum numbers. But the initial state is 1S0, so S_initial = 0, L_initial =0.\n\nWait, but when they emit X, the angular momentum and other quantum numbers must be conserved. So the initial state's angular momentum is J_initial =0. The final state's NN has some J_final, and X has some l (orbital angular momentum), and the total angular momentum must be conserved.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the question is about the partial wave. The partial wave is denoted by the orbital angular momentum state of X. So the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l, and the initial and final states must obey angular momentum conservation.\n\nWait, but the initial state has J=0. So the total angular momentum after emission (J_NN + J_X) must be such that their vector sum equals J_initial=0. But I think when considering partial waves, the orbital angular momentum of X (l) contributes to the angular momentum carried away by X. So the process is:\n\nInitial state: J_initial = 0.\n\nAfter emission: the NN state has some J_NN, and X has orbital angular momentum l and spin s_X.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should model it as the initial total angular momentum is 0, and the final state is NN (with some angular momentum) plus X (with some angular momentum). So the sum of their angular momenta must be 0. But that's a vector sum, which complicates things. However, when considering partial waves, we're considering the orbital angular momentum part. So perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN state is L_final, and their sum must be zero. But that's probably not right, because orbital angular momentum is a vector, and the sum would require that L_NN + l = 0. But L_NN and l are vectors, so their magnitudes can't just be equal and opposite unless they are zero. So that can't be right. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is that the NN system emits a particle X, and the orbital angular momentum part (L) of X is in a state l. Then, the orbital angular momentum of the NN state would have to combine with l to give the initial orbital angular momentum. Wait, the initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial =0 (from 1S0), so L_final_NN + l = L_initial =0. That's not possible unless L_final_NN = l and they're opposite, but angular momentum is quantized in integer units, so that's only possible if L_final_NN = l =0. But that can't be the case here because the options have different L's. So perhaps I'm not considering this correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the transition. The initial state has orbital angular momentum L_initial =0. When the system emits X, the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN state is L_final. So angular momentum conservation would require that L_initial = L_final + l. But L_initial is 0, so L_final = -l. But since L and l are magnitudes (in the context of quantum numbers), this would require that L_final = l, but their directions are opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, this is not possible unless L_final = l =0. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe the total orbital angular momentum of the system (NN plus X) must be conserved. The initial orbital angular momentum is zero. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN state after emission (L_NN) plus the orbital angular momentum of X (l_X) must equal zero. But this is a vector sum, so for this to hold, the only possibility is that L_NN = l_X =0. Because if L_NN and l_X are vectors, their sum can only be zero if they are equal and opposite. But since they're both angular momentum quantum numbers, their magnitudes must be integers. So the only way is if both are zero. But that can't be right because the options have X with different l's, like S (which is l=0), P (l=1), D (l=2), F (l=3), etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The parity of the system is also a consideration. The parity of the initial state is (-1)^L_initial. Since L_initial=0, parity is +1.\n\nWhen the system emits X, the parity of the entire system (NN + X) must be conserved. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. But since X has intrinsic parity -1, and the orbital part contributes (-1)^(L_NN + l_X), because the orbital part for X is in state l_X, which contributes (-1)^l_X. Wait, but the parity of the NN state is (-1)^{L_NN}, and the parity of X is (-1)^{l_X} * intrinsic parity of X. Because when you have a particle emitted via orbital angular momentum l, its parity is (-1)^l multiplied by its intrinsic parity.\n\nSo the initial parity is P_initial = (-1)^0 = 1.\n\nThe final parity is P_final = P_NN * P_X.\n\nP_NN is (-1)^{L_NN}.\n\nP_X is (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) = (-1)^{l_X +1}, because X has intrinsic parity -1.\n\nSo parity conservation requires that P_initial = P_final \u2192 1 = (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l_X +1}.\n\nSimplify that: 1 = (-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1}.\n\nWhich implies that (-1)^{L_NN + l_X +1} = 1 \u2192 L_NN + l_X +1 must be even.\n\nSo L_NN + l_X +1 \u2261 0 mod 2.\n\nWhich means L_NN + l_X \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nSo L_NN and l_X must have opposite parity. One even, one odd.\n\nThat's one condition.\n\nThe other condition comes from Pauli statistics and the given equation: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final state has T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parity. One even, one odd.\n\nSo for each option, I need to determine the L_final and S_final of the NN state, then check both conditions:\n\n1. L_final + l_X must be odd (from parity conservation)\n2. S_final + L_final must be odd (from Pauli condition)\n\nIf both conditions are satisfied, the partial wave is allowed; if not, it's forbidden.\n\nNow, let's look at each option.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0, which is (2S+1)L J \u2192 (2*0 +1) S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nEach option gives the final state of the NN system. Let's parse each option.\n\nOption A: 7D1 + p\n\nThe final state is 7D1. Let's parse this term symbol.\n\nTerm symbol is (2S+1)L J.\n\nSo (2S+1) =7 \u2192 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3.\n\nL is D \u2192 D=2 (since L=0=S, 1=P, 2=D, 3=F, etc.)\n\nJ=1.\n\nSo for this option, S_final=3, L_final=2.\n\nCheck condition 2: S + L = 3 + 2 =5 \u2192 5 mod 2=1. So condition 2 is satisfied.\n\nNow, the particle emitted is p. Let's see what l_X is. Since X is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum l. The options denote the partial wave of X by the letter: for example, p is P, which is l=1.\n\nSo l_X =1.\n\nCondition 1: L_final + l_X must be odd.\n\nL_final=2 (even), l_X=1 (odd). 2+1=3 \u2192 odd. So condition 1 is satisfied.\n\nSo both conditions are met. So this partial wave is allowed.\n\nOption B: 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is 3S1.\n\nWait, no, wait the option is 3S1 + p. So the final NN state is 3S1.\n\nWait, term symbol 3S1.\n\n(2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1.\n\nL is S \u2192 L=0.\n\nJ=1.\n\nSo S_final=1, L_final=0.\n\nCondition 2: S + L =1 +0=1 \u2192 odd. So condition 2 is satisfied.\n\nThe particle is p, which is l=1.\n\nCondition 1: L_final=0 (even) + l_X=1 (odd) \u2192 0+1=1 (odd). So condition 1 is satisfied.\n\nSo this is allowed.\n\nOption C: 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n\nFinal state is 3D3.\n\nTerm symbol: 3D3.\n\n(2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1.\n\nL is D \u2192 2.\n\nJ=3.\n\nSo S_final=1, L_final=2.\n\nCondition 2: S + L =1+2=3 \u2192 odd. Condition 2 satisfied.\n\nParticle is f. f stands for F, which is l=3.\n\nSo l_X=3.\n\nCondition 1: L_final=2 (even) + l_X=3 (odd) \u2192 2+3=5 (odd). Condition 1 satisfied.\n\nSo allowed.\n\nOption D: 1S0 ->3P0 + s\n\nFinal state is 3P0.\n\nTerm symbol: 3P0.\n\n(2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1.\n\nL is P \u2192 1.\n\nJ=0.\n\nSo S_final=1, L_final=1.\n\nCondition 2: S + L =1+1=2 \u2192 even. So condition 2 requires it to be odd. Therefore, condition 2 is not satisfied. So this partial wave is not allowed.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, the final state in option D is 3P0. So S=1, L=1, J=0.\n\nSo S + L = 2. 2 mod 2 is 0. So 0=0 +1 mod 2? No, the equation is T= S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nWait, T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L must be 1 mod 2.\n\nIn option D, S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 0 mod 2. So 0 = 0 +1 \u2192 0=1 \u2192 no. So condition 2 is not met. So the Pauli condition isn't satisfied.\n\nTherefore, option D is not allowed.\n\nWait, but let me check the other condition as well. For option D:\n\nParticle is s. What is l_X? s is for S, which is l=0.\n\nSo l_X=0.\n\nCondition 1: L_final=1 (odd) + l_X=0 (even) \u2192 1+0=1 (odd). So condition 1 is satisfied. But condition 2 isn't. So the wavefunction's symmetry is not satisfied, so this partial wave is forbidden.\n\nSo the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer is option D.\n",

So condition 2 is satisfied.\n\nNow, the particle emitted is p. Let's see what l_X is. Since X is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum l. The options denote the partial wave of X by the letter: for example, p is P, which is l=1.\n\nSo l_X =1.\n\nCondition 1: L_final + l_X must be odd.\n\nL_final=2 (even), l_X=1 (odd). 2+1=3 \u2192 odd. So condition 1 is satisfied.\n\nSo both conditions are met. So this partial wave is allowed.\n\nOption B: 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is 3S1.\n\nWait, no, wait the option is 3S1 + p. So the final NN state is 3S1.\n\nWait, term symbol 3S1.\n\n(2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1.\n\nL is S \u2192 L=0.\n\nJ=1.\n\nSo S_final=1, L_final=0.\n\nCondition 2: S + L =1 +0=1 \u2192 odd. So condition 2 is satisfied.\n\nThe particle is p, which is l=1.\n\nCondition 1: L_final=0 (even) + l_X=1 (odd) \u2192 0+1=1 (odd). So condition 1 is satisfied.\n\nSo this is allowed.\n\nOption C: 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n\nFinal state is 3D3.\n\nTerm symbol: 3D3.\n\n(2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1.\n\nL is D \u2192 2.\n\nJ=3.\n\nSo S_final=1, L_final=2.\n\nCondition 2: S + L =1+2=3 \u2192 odd. Condition 2 satisfied.\n\nParticle is f. f stands for F, which is l=3.\n\nSo l_X=3.\n\nCondition 1: L_final=2 (even) + l_X=3 (odd) \u2192 2+3=5 (odd). Condition 1 satisfied.\n\nSo allowed.\n\nOption D: 1S0 ->3P0 + s\n\nFinal state is 3P0.\n\nTerm symbol: 3P0.\n\n(2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1.\n\nL is P \u2192 1.\n\nJ=0.\n\nSo S_final=1, L_final=1.\n\nCondition 2: S + L =1+1=2 \u2192 even. So condition 2 requires it to be odd. Therefore, condition 2 is not satisfied. So this partial wave is not allowed.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, the final state in option D is 3P0. So S=1, L=1, J=0.\n\nSo S + L = 2. 2 mod 2 is 0. So 0=0 +1 mod 2? No, the equation is T= S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nWait, T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L must be 1 mod 2.\n\nIn option D, S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 0 mod 2. So 0 = 0 +1 \u2192 0=1 \u2192 no. So condition 2 is not met. So the Pauli condition isn't satisfied.\n\nTherefore, option D is not allowed.\n\nWait, but let me check the other condition as well. For option D:\n\nParticle is s. What is l_X? s is for S, which is l=0.\n\nSo l_X=0.\n\nCondition 1: L_final=1 (odd) + l_X=0 (even) \u2192 1+0=1 (odd). So condition 1 is satisfied. But condition 2 isn't. So the wavefunction's symmetry is not satisfied, so this partial wave is forbidden.\n\nSo the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer is option D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The NN system starts in the 1S0 state, which corresponds to \\( S = 0 \\), \\( L = 0 \\), and \\( J = 0 \\). The intrinsic parity of the initial state is \\( (-1)^L = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Final State**: After emitting a particle \\( X \\), the NN system has a final state with \\( T(NN) = 0 \\). From the Pauli statistics condition \\( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2) \\), we find that \\( S(NN) + L(NN) \\) must be odd.\n\n3. **Parity Conservation**: The parity of the system must be conserved. The initial parity is \\( P_{\\text{initial}} = 1 \\). The final parity is \\( P_{\\text{final}} = (-1)^{L_{\\text{NN}}} \\cdot (-1)^{l_X} \\cdot (-1) \\), where \\( l_X \\) is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle \\( X \\). This simplifies to \\( P_{\\text{final}} = (-1)^{L_{\\text{NN}} + l_X + 1} \\). For parity conservation, \\( L_{\\text{NN}} + l_X + 1 \\) must be even, meaning \\( L_{\\text{NN}} + l_X \\) must be odd.\n\n4. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \\( 1S0 \\to 7D1 + p \\)\n     - Final state: \\( S = 3 \\), \\( L = 2 \\), \\( J = 1 \\).\n     - \\( S + L = 3 + 2 = 5 \\), which is odd (Pauli condition satisfied).\n     - \\( l_X = 1 \\) (particle \\( p \\) corresponds to \\( l = 1 \\)).\n     - \\( L_{\\text{NN}} + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3 \\), which is odd (parity condition satisfied).\n     - **Allowed**.\n\n   - **Option B**: \\( 1S0 \\to 3S1 + p \\)\n     - Final state: \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 0 \\), \\( J = 1 \\).\n     - \\( S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 \\), which is odd (Pauli condition satisfied).\n     - \\( l_X = 1 \\) (particle \\( p \\) corresponds to \\( l = 1 \\)).\n     - \\( L_{\\text{NN}} + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1 \\), which is odd (parity condition satisfied).\n     - **Allowed**.\n\n   - **Option C**: \\( 1S0 \\to 3D3 + f \\)\n     - Final state: \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 2 \\), \\( J = 3 \\).\n     - \\( S + L = 1 + 2 = 3 \\), which is odd (Pauli condition satisfied).\n     - \\( l_X = 3 \\) (particle \\( f \\) corresponds to \\( l = 3 \\)).\n     - \\( L_{\\text{NN}} + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5 \\), which is odd (parity condition satisfied).\n     - **Allowed**.\n\n   - **Option D**: \\( 1S0 \\to 3P0 + s \\)\n     - Final state: \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 1 \\), \\( J = 0 \\).\n     - \\( S + L = 1 + 1 = 2 \\), which is even (Pauli condition not satisfied).\n     - \\( l_X = 0 \\) (particle \\( s \\) corresponds to \\( l = 0 \\)).\n     - \\( L_{\\text{NN}} + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1 \\), which is odd (parity condition satisfied).\n     - Since the Pauli condition is not satisfied, this partial wave is **not allowed**.\n\n**Conclusion**: The partial wave not permitted is in **Option D**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. The question is about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons, and determining which partial wave is not allowed based on certain quantum numbers and conservation laws. Hmm, I think I remember some basics about angular momentum and parity from my studies, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this carefully.\n\nAlright, the problem states that two nucleons (like protons or neutrons) are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics require that the isospin (T), angular momentum (L), and spin (S) of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So, the sum of T, S, and L, each taken modulo 2, must add up to 1 mod 2? Or is it T = S + L +1 mod 2? I think it's the latter because the equation is written as T = S + L +1 (mod 2). So, the parity condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nThe final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, substituting into the equation: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. That implies S + L = 1 mod 2. Because 0 = (S+L+1) mod 2 \u2192 (S+L) mod 2 = 1. So S and L must have opposite parity. If one is even, the other must be odd.\n\nNow, the problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from the initial state (1S0) to a final state plus a particle. The particle X is either p, f, s, or something else, but the options denote it as lowercase letters: like p, s, f. Wait, those usually denote the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers. Oh, right! The letters are the spectroscopic notation for orbital angular momentum: S is 0, P is 1, D is 2, F is 3, etc. So the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum state is given by that letter.\n\nWait, but the particle X is emitted, so the process is the NN system emitting X. The initial state is 1S0, which is a state with total spin S = 1 (since 2S+1 = 1 \u2192 S=0? Wait, wait, no. The notation is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean 2S+1=1 \u2192 S=0, L=0 (since S0), and J=0. Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0: 2S+1=1 \u2192 S=0. L is denoted by S here? Wait, no, the first part is S, but in the term symbol, the S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So 1S0 would have S=0, L=0 (since S0 is the orbital part, but wait, S is the spin here, L is the orbital part). Hmm, I think I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J, where S is the total spin (in units of \u0127), L is the orbital angular momentum (in spectroscopic notation: S=0, P=1, D=2, etc.), and J is the total angular momentum. So for 1S0: 2S+1=1 \u2192 S=0. L is S? No, wait, no. The L is the orbital angular momentum, which in spectroscopic notation is S=0, P=1, D=2, etc. So 1S0 would mean L=0 (since S0 refers to orbital angular momentum L=0), and the spin S=0. The J is the total angular momentum, which would be 0 because S=0 and L=0, so J=0.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the initial state is S=0, L=0, J=0. So the initial state has spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, and total angular momentum 0.\n\nNow, the particle X is emitted. Let's think about the process: the initial state is the NN system in state 1S0, which emits X. So the final state is the NN system plus the emitted particle X. But the question seems to describe the NN state after emission, not the entire system. Wait, the question says, \"the final NN state has T(NN) = 0.\" So the NN system after emitting X has T=0.\n\nWait, but the process is the NN system (initially in 1S0) emits X, so the total system is NN + X. But the problem is about the NN state after emission, so perhaps the emitted X is a separate particle, and we're looking at the NN system's quantum numbers.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the final NN state has T(NN) = 0.\" So the NN state's isospin is 0. So, the emitted X has some quantum numbers, and we have to look at the possible transitions that conserve angular momentum and parity.\n\nWait, but the initial state is NN in 1S0, which I think is spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, so total J=0. But when the NN emits X, the final state would have the NN system in a certain state plus X.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is considering the decay as NN \u2192 NN' + X, where NN' is the final state of the NN system. So in that case, the initial NN state is 1S0, and the final state is NN' plus X. But the question says the final NN state has T=0, so we're considering NN' with T=0.\n\nBut the problem is about the allowed partial waves for X. The partial wave is denoted by the orbital angular momentum state of X, I think. So, for each option, the emitted particle is in a state with orbital angular momentum l, given by the letter (p is l=1, s is l=0, f is l=3, etc.), and the question is about which of these is not allowed based on conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nWait, but the options are phrased as 1S0 \u2192 ... + p, etc. So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is something plus the emitted particle. So, perhaps the problem is about the decay of the initial state into a new state and a particle, and we're to find which such decay is not allowed.\n\nWait, but the initial state is 1S0. So when the NN system emits X, the final state is another state (like 7D1) plus X. The problem is to determine which of these final states (7D1, 3S1, etc.) is not allowed based on the given Pauli condition and conservation laws.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0, so we have to find the partial wave (denoted by the emitted particle's orbital state) that is not permitted. So, perhaps the allowed transitions are constrained by angular momentum and parity conservation.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to consider is parity. The initial state has a certain parity, and the final state must have the same parity because parity is conserved in the absence of a strong magnetic field, I think. But wait, the emission of a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the final state (NN' + X) must be the same as the initial state's parity.\n\nBut wait, the parity of a system is the product of the intrinsic parities of its components multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum between them. Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the initial state and the final state.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0: S=0, L=0, so the parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. Because for orbital angular momentum L, parity is (-1)^L. Since the initial state is a bound state, I think its parity is (-1)^L, so for L=0, parity is +1.\n\nWhen the NN system emits X, the final state will consist of the NN' system and X. The parity of the entire system (NN' + X) must be the same as the initial parity. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of NN' and the parity of X, multiplied by (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum between the NN' system and X. But wait, I think in the context of this problem, the emitted particle X's orbital angular momentum is considered as part of the decay process, so perhaps the overall parity is determined by the product of the intrinsic parities and the orbital angular momentum's contribution.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately: The parity of the initial state is P_initial = (-1)^{L_initial} * intrinsic parity of NN. The initial state is 1S0, which is a state with L=0. So P_initial = (-1)^0 * (parity of NN in 1S0 state). Wait, but what's the parity of the NN system in 1S0? For a two-nucleon system, the parity is (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. So if the initial state is 1S0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nWhen the NN system emits X, the final state's parity must be the same as the initial. The final state is NN' plus X. The parity of the final state is P_final = P_NN' * P_X * (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum between the NN' system and X. But in this case, perhaps the orbital angular momentum L' is the same as the orbital state of X, which is given by the letter (like p is L'=1, D is 2, etc.). Wait, but no, the orbital angular momentum L' is the relative angular momentum between the NN' system and X, which is the same as the orbital angular momentum of X in the decay process. So the parity of the final state would be P_NN' * P_X * (-1)^{L'}, and this must equal P_initial = +1.\n\nSo, P_NN' is the parity of the NN' state, which depends on their L. The parity of X is given as -1. So putting it together: P_final = P_NN' * (-1) * (-1)^{L'} = P_NN' * (-1)^{L' + 1}.\n\nThis must equal the initial parity, which is +1.\n\nSo, P_NN' * (-1)^{L' + 1} = 1.\n\nBut what's the parity of the NN' state? The parity of the NN' state is (-1)^{L_NN'}, where L_NN' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system after emission.\n\nWait, but in the options, the final NN' state is given in terms of their L. For example, option A is 7D1. The term symbol is (2S'+1)L'(J'). So 7D1 would mean (2S'+1)=7 \u2192 S'=3, L'=2 (since D is 2), and J'=1.\n\nSo the parity of NN' would be (-1)^{L'}, since L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system. So for 7D1, L' is 2 \u2192 parity is (-1)^2 = +1.\n\nSo, for each option, we can compute P_NN' as (-1)^{L'}, and L' is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted X, which is the letter's value. Wait, no, the letter in the options refers to the orbital angular momentum of X. For example, in option A, the final state is 7D1 plus p. p is orbital angular momentum l=1. So L' in the decay is l=1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the orbital angular momentum L' is the same as the emitted particle's orbital state. So, for example, if the emitted X is in a p state, then L' = 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum between the NN' system and X is the same as the orbital angular momentum of X itself in the decay process. So, if X is emitted in a p state, then L' =1.\n\nPutting this all together, for each option, we can compute whether the parity condition holds.\n\nLet me try this approach for each option.\n\nThe equation is:\n\nP_NN' * (-1)^{L' + 1} = 1.\n\nBut P_NN' is (-1)^{L_NN'}, and L_NN' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system.\n\nWait, but the term symbol for the final state gives us L_NN' (like D=2, S=0, etc.), so for each option, we can get L_NN'.\n\nSo, let's take each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nThe final NN' state is 7D1. So L_NN' is D=2. So P_NN' = (-1)^2 = +1.\n\nThe emitted particle is p, which has L'=1 (since p is l=1).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nP_NN' * (-1)^{L' +1} = (+1) * (-1)^{1 +1} = (+1) * (-1)^2 = (+1) * (1) = 1. Which equals the initial parity of +1. So this is allowed.\n\nWait, but the equation should be P_final = P_initial, which is 1. So this would satisfy the parity condition. So this is allowed.\n\nOption B: 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p.\n\nFinal NN' state is 3S1. So L_NN' is S=0. So P_NN' = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nEmitted particle is p, L' =1.\n\nEquation: (+1) * (-1)^{1+1} = (+1) * (-1)^2 = 1. So parity condition holds. So this is allowed.\n\nOption C: 1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f.\n\nFinal NN' state is 3D3. So L_NN' is D=2. P_NN' = (-1)^2 = +1.\n\nEmitted particle is f, which is l=3. So L' =3.\n\nEquation: (+1) * (-1)^{3+1} = (+1) * (-1)^4 = (+1) * 1 =1. So parity holds. So this is allowed.\n\nOption D: 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s.\n\nFinal NN' state is 3P0. So L_NN' is P=1. So P_NN' = (-1)^1 = -1.\n\nEmitted particle is s, which is l=0. So L' =0.\n\nEquation: (-1) * (-1)^{0+1} = (-1) * (-1)^1 = (-1) * (-1) = 1. So parity holds. So this is allowed.\n\nWait, but all options seem to satisfy the parity condition. That can't be right because the question says one is not allowed. So perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should also consider the angular momentum conservation. Because the initial state has certain angular momentum, and the final state must have the same total angular momentum.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial state is 1S0, which has J=0. So the total angular momentum of the system before emission is J_initial =0.\n\nAfter emission, the final state is NN' with some J_final and the emitted particle X with some J_X. The total angular momentum must be conserved, so J_initial = J_final + J_X. But J_initial is 0, so J_final must equal -J_X (but since J is a vector, this implies J_final and J_X must cancel each other out. So perhaps J_final = J_X. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the total angular momentum of the final state must equal the initial state's J, which is 0. So the sum of the angular momenta of NN' and X must be zero.\n\nBut angular momentum is a vector, so the possible total J is the result of adding the two angular momenta. But given that J_initial is 0, the only possibility is that the sum of J_NN' and J_X is zero. Which would require that J_NN' = J_X, and they are opposite in direction. But since J is a non-negative integer or half-integer, the only way their sum is zero is if J_NN' = J_X =0. But that's not possible for all cases.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think differently. The initial state has J=0. The final state must have J=0 as well, because angular momentum is conserved. So the total angular momentum after emission is the vector sum of J_NN' and J_X, which must equal zero. Therefore, J_NN' must equal J_X, but in opposite directions. But since angular momentum is quantized, the only way this can happen is if J_NN' = J_X =0. Otherwise, their sum can't be zero unless they are zero. But that's not necessarily the case because you can have a combination of angular momenta adding to zero.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The sum of two angular momenta can be zero if their magnitudes are equal and their directions opposite. But in quantum mechanics, this is possible only if their sum can produce a state with J=0. For example, if J_NN' =1 and J_X=1, then their vector sum could be 0 if they are opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, the possible total J after combining two angular momenta J1 and J2 is |J1-J2| to J1+J2, in integer steps. So for J_initial=0, the only possible way is that J_NN' and J_X must combine to give zero. That would require that their sum can produce J=0. So for example, if J_NN' =1 and J_X=1, then their sum can be 0 (if their directions are opposite), but in quantum terms, the state would have to be symmetric under exchange, but perhaps that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the orbital angular momentum and spin contributions, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial state has J=0, so the sum of the orbital angular momentum and spin of the final state must also be zero. So the final state must have J=0 as well. So for each option, the final NN' state has a certain J, and the emitted X has a certain J. But since the initial J is 0, the sum must be zero. So the only way that can happen is if the emitted X has the same J as the NN' state, but in opposite direction, but that's not possible because J is a non-negative integer. So perhaps the only possibility is that both J's are zero. But that can't be right because the emitted particle can't have zero spin unless it's a scalar boson, which I don't think is the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the key is to focus on the Pauli condition and the parity.\n\nWait, earlier I thought all options satisfy the parity condition. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me recheck each option.\n\nOption A: 7D1 + p.\n\nNN' state: 7D1 \u2192 L_NN' = 2. P_NN' = (+1).\n\nEmitted X: p \u2192 L' =1.\n\nSo P_final = P_NN' * (-1)^{L' +1} = (+1) * (-1)^(1+1) = (+1) * (-1)^2 = (+1)(1) =1. Which matches initial parity of +1. So parity is conserved.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p.\n\nNN' L=0 \u2192 P_NN'=+1.\n\nX L'=1.\n\nP_final = (+1) * (-1)^{1+1} = (+1) * 1 =1. Okay.\n\nOption C: 3D3 + f.\n\nNN' L=2 \u2192 P=+1.\n\nX L'=3.\n\nP_final = (+1) * (-1)^{3+1} = (+1) * (+1) =1. Okay.\n\nOption D: 3P0 + s.\n\nNN' L=1 \u2192 P=-1.\n\nX L'=0.\n\nP_final = (-1) * (-1)^{0 +1} = (-1) * (-1)^1 = (-1)*(-1)=1. So parity is conserved.\n\nHmm, all options pass the parity condition. So perhaps I need to look at another condition: the Pauli condition involving T, S, and L.\n\nThe problem statement says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.\n\nIn the final state, T(NN) =0.\n\nSo 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L =1 mod 2.\n\nSo S and L must have opposite parity. So if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.\n\nNow, the final NN' state's S and L are given by their term symbol. For each option, we can compute S and L for the NN' state and see if S + L \u22611 mod 2.\n\nWait, but wait. The term symbol for the NN' state is (2S+1)L' J. So for each option, the first part is 2S+1, so S can be determined.\n\nSo let's compute S and L for each option.\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 (2S+1)=7 \u2192 S=3. L=2 (D=2). So S=3, L=2. S + L =3+2=5 \u2192 5 mod 2 =1. So 1 \u22611 mod 2 \u2192 condition holds. So this is allowed.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L=0 (S=0). S + L =1+0=1 \u2192 mod 2 is 1. Condition holds.\n\nOption C:3D3 \u2192 (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L=2. S+L=3 \u21921 mod 2. Condition holds.\n\nOption D:3P0 \u2192 (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L=1 (P=1). S + L=2 \u2192 mod 2 is 0. So 0 \u22601 mod 2. So this violates the Pauli condition. Therefore, this transition is not allowed.\n\nAh, so that's the key. So option D violates the Pauli condition because S + L =2 \u2192 even, which doesn't satisfy the condition of S + L =1 mod 2. So this option is not allowed.\n\nSo the answer would be option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. The question is about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons, and determining which partial wave is not allowed based on certain quantum numbers and conservation laws. Hmm, I think I remember some basics about angular momentum and parity from my studies, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this carefully.\n\nAlright, the problem states that two nucleons (like protons or neutrons) are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics require that the isospin (T), angular momentum (L), and spin (S) of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So, the sum of T, S, and L, each taken modulo 2, must add up to 1 mod 2? Or is it T = S + L +1 mod 2? I think it's the latter because the equation is written as T = S + L +1 (mod 2). So, the parity condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nThe final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, substituting into the equation: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. That implies S + L = 1 mod 2. Because 0 = (S+L+1) mod 2 \u2192 (S+L) mod 2 = 1. So S and L must have opposite parity. If one is even, the other must be odd.\n\nNow, the problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from the initial state (1S0) to a final state plus a particle. The particle X is either p, f, s, or something else, but the options denote it as lowercase letters: like p, s, f. Wait, those usually denote the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers. Oh, right! The letters are the spectroscopic notation for orbital angular momentum: S is 0, P is 1, D is 2, F is 3, etc. So the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum state is given by that letter.\n\nWait, but the particle X is emitted, so the process is the NN system emitting X. The initial state is 1S0, which is a state with total spin S = 1 (since 2S+1 = 1 \u2192 S=0? Wait, wait, no. The notation is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean 2S+1=1 \u2192 S=0, L=0 (since S0), and J=0. Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0: 2S+1=1 \u2192 S=0. L is denoted by S here? Wait, no, the first part is S, but in the term symbol, the S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So 1S0 would have S=0, L=0 (since S0 is the orbital part, but wait, S is the spin here, L is the orbital part). Hmm, I think I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J, where S is the total spin (in units of \u0127), L is the orbital angular momentum (in spectroscopic notation: S=0, P=1, D=2, etc.), and J is the total angular momentum. So for 1S0: 2S+1=1 \u2192 S=0. L is S? No, wait, no. The L is the orbital angular momentum, which in spectroscopic notation is S=0, P=1, D=2, etc. So 1S0 would mean L=0 (since S0 refers to orbital angular momentum L=0), and the spin S=0. The J is the total angular momentum, which would be 0 because S=0 and L=0, so J=0.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the initial state is S=0, L=0, J=0. So the initial state has spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, and total angular momentum 0.\n\nNow, the particle X is emitted. Let's think about the process: the initial state is the NN system in state 1S0, which emits X. So the final state is the NN system plus the emitted particle X. But the question seems to describe the NN state after emission, not the entire system. Wait, the question says, \"the final NN state has T(NN) = 0.\" So the NN system after emitting X has T=0.\n\nWait, but the process is the NN system (initially in 1S0) emits X, so the total system is NN + X. But the problem is about the NN state after emission, so perhaps the emitted X is a separate particle, and we're looking at the NN system's quantum numbers.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the final NN state has T(NN) = 0.\" So the NN state's isospin is 0. So, the emitted X has some quantum numbers, and we have to look at the possible transitions that conserve angular momentum and parity.\n\nWait, but the initial state is NN in 1S0, which I think is spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, so total J=0. But when the NN emits X, the final state would have the NN system in a certain state plus X.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is considering the decay as NN \u2192 NN' + X, where NN' is the final state of the NN system. So in that case, the initial NN state is 1S0, and the final state is NN' plus X. But the question says the final NN state has T=0, so we're considering NN' with T=0.\n\nBut the problem is about the allowed partial waves for X. The partial wave is denoted by the orbital angular momentum state of X, I think. So, for each option, the emitted particle is in a state with orbital angular momentum l, given by the letter (p is l=1, s is l=0, f is l=3, etc.), and the question is about which of these is not allowed based on conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nWait, but the options are phrased as 1S0 \u2192 ... + p, etc. So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is something plus the emitted particle. So, perhaps the problem is about the decay of the initial state into a new state and a particle, and we're to find which such decay is not allowed.\n\nWait, but the initial state is 1S0. So when the NN system emits X, the final state is another state (like 7D1) plus X. The problem is to determine which of these final states (7D1, 3S1, etc.) is not allowed based on the given Pauli condition and conservation laws.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0, so we have to find the partial wave (denoted by the emitted particle's orbital state) that is not permitted. So, perhaps the allowed transitions are constrained by angular momentum and parity conservation.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to consider is parity. The initial state has a certain parity, and the final state must have the same parity because parity is conserved in the absence of a strong magnetic field, I think. But wait, the emission of a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the final state (NN' + X) must be the same as the initial state's parity.\n\nBut wait, the parity of a system is the product of the intrinsic parities of its components multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum between them. Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the initial state and the final state.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0: S=0, L=0, so the parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. Because for orbital angular momentum L, parity is (-1)^L. Since the initial state is a bound state, I think its parity is (-1)^L, so for L=0, parity is +1.\n\nWhen the NN system emits X, the final state will consist of the NN' system and X. The parity of the entire system (NN' + X) must be the same as the initial parity. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of NN' and the parity of X, multiplied by (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum between the NN' system and X. But wait, I think in the context of this problem, the emitted particle X's orbital angular momentum is considered as part of the decay process, so perhaps the overall parity is determined by the product of the intrinsic parities and the orbital angular momentum's contribution.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately: The parity of the initial state is P_initial = (-1)^{L_initial} * intrinsic parity of NN. The initial state is 1S0, which is a state with L=0. So P_initial = (-1)^0 * (parity of NN in 1S0 state). Wait, but what's the parity of the NN system in 1S0? For a two-nucleon system, the parity is (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. So if the initial state is 1S0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nWhen the NN system emits X, the final state's parity must be the same as the initial. The final state is NN' plus X. The parity of the final state is P_final = P_NN' * P_X * (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum between the NN' system and X. But in this case, perhaps the orbital angular momentum L' is the same as the orbital state of X, which is given by the letter (like p is L'=1, D is 2, etc.). Wait, but no, the orbital angular momentum L' is the relative angular momentum between the NN' system and X, which is the same as the orbital angular momentum of X in the decay process. So the parity of the final state would be P_NN' * P_X * (-1)^{L'}, and this must equal P_initial = +1.\n\nSo, P_NN' is the parity of the NN' state, which depends on their L. The parity of X is given as -1. So putting it together: P_final = P_NN' * (-1) * (-1)^{L'} = P_NN' * (-1)^{L' + 1}.\n\nThis must equal the initial parity, which is +1.\n\nSo, P_NN' * (-1)^{L' + 1} = 1.\n\nBut what's the parity of the NN' state? The parity of the NN' state is (-1)^{L_NN'}, where L_NN' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system after emission.\n\nWait, but in the options, the final NN' state is given in terms of their L. For example, option A is 7D1. The term symbol is (2S'+1)L'(J'). So 7D1 would mean (2S'+1)=7 \u2192 S'=3, L'=2 (since D is 2), and J'=1.\n\nSo the parity of NN' would be (-1)^{L'}, since L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system. So for 7D1, L' is 2 \u2192 parity is (-1)^2 = +1.\n\nSo, for each option, we can compute P_NN' as (-1)^{L'}, and L' is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted X, which is the letter's value. Wait, no, the letter in the options refers to the orbital angular momentum of X. For example, in option A, the final state is 7D1 plus p. p is orbital angular momentum l=1. So L' in the decay is l=1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the orbital angular momentum L' is the same as the emitted particle's orbital state. So, for example, if the emitted X is in a p state, then L' = 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum between the NN' system and X is the same as the orbital angular momentum of X itself in the decay process. So, if X is emitted in a p state, then L' =1.\n\nPutting this all together, for each option, we can compute whether the parity condition holds.\n\nLet me try this approach for each option.\n\nThe equation is:\n\nP_NN' * (-1)^{L' + 1} = 1.\n\nBut P_NN' is (-1)^{L_NN'}, and L_NN' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system.\n\nWait, but the term symbol for the final state gives us L_NN' (like D=2, S=0, etc.), so for each option, we can get L_NN'.\n\nSo, let's take each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nThe final NN' state is 7D1. So L_NN' is D=2. So P_NN' = (-1)^2 = +1.\n\nThe emitted particle is p, which has L'=1 (since p is l=1).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nP_NN' * (-1)^{L' +1} = (+1) * (-1)^{1 +1} = (+1) * (-1)^2 = (+1) * (1) = 1. Which equals the initial parity of +1. So this is allowed.\n\nWait, but the equation should be P_final = P_initial, which is 1. So this would satisfy the parity condition. So this is allowed.\n\nOption B: 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p.\n\nFinal NN' state is 3S1. So L_NN' is S=0. So P_NN' = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nEmitted particle is p, L' =1.\n\nEquation: (+1) * (-1)^{1+1} = (+1) * (-1)^2 = 1. So parity condition holds. So this is allowed.\n\nOption C: 1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f.\n\nFinal NN' state is 3D3. So L_NN' is D=2. P_NN' = (-1)^2 = +1.\n\nEmitted particle is f, which is l=3. So L' =3.\n\nEquation: (+1) * (-1)^{3+1} = (+1) * (-1)^4 = (+1) * 1 =1. So parity holds. So this is allowed.\n\nOption D: 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s.\n\nFinal NN' state is 3P0. So L_NN' is P=1. So P_NN' = (-1)^1 = -1.\n\nEmitted particle is s, which is l=0. So L' =0.\n\nEquation: (-1) * (-1)^{0+1} = (-1) * (-1)^1 = (-1) * (-1) = 1. So parity holds. So this is allowed.\n\nWait, but all options seem to satisfy the parity condition. That can't be right because the question says one is not allowed. So perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should also consider the angular momentum conservation. Because the initial state has certain angular momentum, and the final state must have the same total angular momentum.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial state is 1S0, which has J=0. So the total angular momentum of the system before emission is J_initial =0.\n\nAfter emission, the final state is NN' with some J_final and the emitted particle X with some J_X. The total angular momentum must be conserved, so J_initial = J_final + J_X. But J_initial is 0, so J_final must equal -J_X (but since J is a vector, this implies J_final and J_X must cancel each other out. So perhaps J_final = J_X. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the total angular momentum of the final state must equal the initial state's J, which is 0. So the sum of the angular momenta of NN' and X must be zero.\n\nBut angular momentum is a vector, so the possible total J is the result of adding the two angular momenta. But given that J_initial is 0, the only possibility is that the sum of J_NN' and J_X is zero. Which would require that J_NN' = J_X, and they are opposite in direction. But since J is a non-negative integer or half-integer, the only way their sum is zero is if J_NN' = J_X =0. But that's not possible for all cases.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think differently. The initial state has J=0. The final state must have J=0 as well, because angular momentum is conserved. So the total angular momentum after emission is the vector sum of J_NN' and J_X, which must equal zero. Therefore, J_NN' must equal J_X, but in opposite directions. But since angular momentum is quantized, the only way this can happen is if J_NN' = J_X =0. Otherwise, their sum can't be zero unless they are zero. But that's not necessarily the case because you can have a combination of angular momenta adding to zero.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The sum of two angular momenta can be zero if their magnitudes are equal and their directions opposite. But in quantum mechanics, this is possible only if their sum can produce a state with J=0. For example, if J_NN' =1 and J_X=1, then their vector sum could be 0 if they are opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, the possible total J after combining two angular momenta J1 and J2 is |J1-J2| to J1+J2, in integer steps. So for J_initial=0, the only possible way is that J_NN' and J_X must combine to give zero. That would require that their sum can produce J=0. So for example, if J_NN' =1 and J_X=1, then their sum can be 0 (if their directions are opposite), but in quantum terms, the state would have to be symmetric under exchange, but perhaps that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the orbital angular momentum and spin contributions, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial state has J=0, so the sum of the orbital angular momentum and spin of the final state must also be zero. So the final state must have J=0 as well. So for each option, the final NN' state has a certain J, and the emitted X has a certain J. But since the initial J is 0, the sum must be zero. So the only way that can happen is if the emitted X has the same J as the NN' state, but in opposite direction, but that's not possible because J is a non-negative integer. So perhaps the only possibility is that both J's are zero. But that can't be right because the emitted particle can't have zero spin unless it's a scalar boson, which I don't think is the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the key is to focus on the Pauli condition and the parity.\n\nWait, earlier I thought all options satisfy the parity condition. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me recheck each option.\n\nOption A: 7D1 + p.\n\nNN' state: 7D1 \u2192 L_NN' = 2. P_NN' = (+1).\n\nEmitted X: p \u2192 L' =1.\n\nSo P_final = P_NN' * (-1)^{L' +1} = (+1) * (-1)^(1+1) = (+1) * (-1)^2 = (+1)(1) =1. Which matches initial parity of +1. So parity is conserved.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p.\n\nNN' L=0 \u2192 P_NN'=+1.\n\nX L'=1.\n\nP_final = (+1) * (-1)^{1+1} = (+1) * 1 =1. Okay.\n\nOption C: 3D3 + f.\n\nNN' L=2 \u2192 P=+1.\n\nX L'=3.\n\nP_final = (+1) * (-1)^{3+1} = (+1) * (+1) =1. Okay.\n\nOption D: 3P0 + s.\n\nNN' L=1 \u2192 P=-1.\n\nX L'=0.\n\nP_final = (-1) * (-1)^{0 +1} = (-1) * (-1)^1 = (-1)*(-1)=1. So parity is conserved.\n\nHmm, all options pass the parity condition. So perhaps I need to look at another condition: the Pauli condition involving T, S, and L.\n\nThe problem statement says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.\n\nIn the final state, T(NN) =0.\n\nSo 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L =1 mod 2.\n\nSo S and L must have opposite parity. So if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.\n\nNow, the final NN' state's S and L are given by their term symbol. For each option, we can compute S and L for the NN' state and see if S + L \u22611 mod 2.\n\nWait, but wait. The term symbol for the NN' state is (2S+1)L' J. So for each option, the first part is 2S+1, so S can be determined.\n\nSo let's compute S and L for each option.\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 (2S+1)=7 \u2192 S=3. L=2 (D=2). So S=3, L=2. S + L =3+2=5 \u2192 5 mod 2 =1. So 1 \u22611 mod 2 \u2192 condition holds. So this is allowed.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L=0 (S=0). S + L =1+0=1 \u2192 mod 2 is 1. Condition holds.\n\nOption C:3D3 \u2192 (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L=2. S+L=3 \u21921 mod 2. Condition holds.\n\nOption D:3P0 \u2192 (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L=1 (P=1). S + L=2 \u2192 mod 2 is 0. So 0 \u22601 mod 2. So this violates the Pauli condition. Therefore, this transition is not allowed.\n\nAh, so that's the key. So option D violates the Pauli condition because S + L =2 \u2192 even, which doesn't satisfy the condition of S + L =1 mod 2. So this option is not allowed.\n\nSo the answer would be option D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The NN system is in the 1S0 state. This implies:\n   - Total spin \\( S = 0 \\),\n   - Orbital angular momentum \\( L = 0 \\),\n   - Total angular momentum \\( J = 0 \\),\n   - Parity \\( P_{\\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \\).\n\n2. **Final State**: The NN system emits a particle \\( X \\) with intrinsic parity \\( -1 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about quantum mechanics, specifically dealing with nucleons, angular momentum, and parity. But I'll try to take it step by step.\n\nThe question says that we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted based on conservation laws.\n\nHmm. So, let's break down what I know. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, 2S+1 = 1 implies S=0 (since 2*0 +1=1). L is S in the term symbol, which is S here. Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0: 2S+1=1 \u2192 S=0, L is S? No, wait no. Wait, the term symbol is written as (2S+1)L J^P. So 1S0 would be (2S+1)=1 \u2192 S=0. L is S? No, no, wait. Oh, no, no, no. I think I'm getting confused. Let me think. The term symbol is (2S+1) L (J), where L is the orbital angular momentum in spectroscopic notation. So, for example, S is 0, P is 1, D is 2, etc.\n\nSo the initial state is 1S0. So S=0, L=0 (since it's S, which is 0), and J=0. Because J is the total angular momentum, which is S + L. Since both are 0, J is 0.\n\nNow, the NN system emits a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the initial state is the NN in 1S0, and the final state is NN in some state plus X.\n\nThe question is about the partial waves allowed. Each option gives a transition from 1S0 to another state plus a particle X with a specific angular momentum state. The options are A) 7D1 + p, B)3S1 + p, C)3D3 + f, D)3P0 + s.\n\nWait, the letters after the numbers in the options are the particles emitted. For example, option A is 7D1 plus p, which I think means that X is a p (a particle with orbital angular momentum l=1, since p is P state). Similarly, f would be l=3, s is l=0.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that X has intrinsic parity -1. So I need to remember the parity of the emitted particle. The parity of a particle is given by (-1)^(l+1), where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the emitted particle's state. Or wait, no, the parity of the emitted particle X is given as intrinsic parity -1. So for a particle emitted in an l state, its parity is (-1)^(l+1). Because the parity of a state with orbital angular momentum l is (-1)^l, but for a particle, the intrinsic parity is (-1)^(l+1) if it's a boson? Wait, maybe I should think again.\n\nWait, for a meson or a boson, the intrinsic parity is (-1)^(l) for orbital angular momentum l. Or wait, no. Let me clarify. For a particle emitted via a transition, the parity of the emitted particle is determined by the parity operator acting on it. For a spin-0 particle (like a pion), the parity is intrinsic. The pion, for example, has intrinsic parity -1. But in this case, the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1. So regardless of its orbital state, its parity is -1. Wait, no, no. The parity of a particle in a state with orbital angular momentum l is given by (-1)^{l} times its intrinsic parity. Because when you have orbital angular momentum, the parity is (-1)^l times the intrinsic parity.\n\nWait, the intrinsic parity is a property of the particle itself, independent of its orbital state. So for example, a pion (spin 0) has intrinsic parity -1. So if the pion is emitted in an orbital state with l, then its total parity would be (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So when it's emitted in an orbital state with angular momentum l, the parity of X is (-1)^{l} * (-1) = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me take a step back.\n\nThe initial state is NN in 1S0, which has certain parity. The final state is NN in another state plus X. So the parity of the initial state is the parity of the NN system. The parity of the final state should be the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X, since parity is multiplicative.\n\nWait, no. Let me think about parity conservation. The parity of the initial state should equal the parity of the final state, because parity is a conserved quantity in strong interactions (but not in weak). Since this is a strong interaction process (emitting a pion or something), parity is conserved.\n\nSo, initial parity of NN is the parity of the 1S0 state. For a two-nucleon system, the parity is given by (-1)^L * (intrinsic parity of nucleon)^2. Wait, each nucleon is a fermion, so their intrinsic parity is -1. So the intrinsic parity of the NN system is (-1) * (-1) = +1. The orbital part is (-1)^L. So the parity of the initial state is (-1)^L_initial * (intrinsic parity of NN system). Wait, no. Wait, the parity of a two-body system is given by the product of the intrinsic parities of each particle and (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum between them.\n\nSo each nucleon has intrinsic parity -1. So the product is (-1) * (-1) = 1. Then multiply by (-1)^L_initial. Initial state is L=0 (1S0), so parity is 1 * (-1)^0 = 1.\n\nSo the initial parity is +1.\n\nThe final state is the NN system in some state plus X. The parity of the final state must be the same as the initial, which is +1.\n\nThe parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN final state and the parity of X.\n\nWait, no. Because the final state is the NN system plus X. So the parity of the entire system is the product of the parities of each part. But since we're considering the NN system as a separate entity and X as another, their parities multiply.\n\nSo parity_final = parity_NN_final * parity_X.\n\nBut the parity_NN_final is the parity of the NN state after emission, which is determined by their orbital angular momentum and their intrinsic parity. And parity_X is the parity of the emitted particle.\n\nSo parity_NN_final = (-1)^L_final * (intrinsic parity of NN system).\n\nWait, the NN system's intrinsic parity is (each nucleon's parity is -1) \u2192 (-1)*(-1) = +1. So parity_NN_final = (-1)^L_final * 1 = (-1)^L_final.\n\nSo parity_final = [ (-1)^L_final ] * [ parity_X ].\n\nAnd since parity_final must equal initial parity (which is +1), we have:\n\n(-1)^L_final * parity_X = 1.\n\nSo, (-1)^L_final * parity_X = 1.\n\nWe also know that X has intrinsic parity -1, but wait, the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is (-1)^l_X * (intrinsic parity of X), where l_X is the orbital angular momentum of X. But wait, in this context, when X is emitted, it's in a state with orbital angular momentum l, so its parity is (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) because intrinsic parity is -1. So parity_X = (-1)^{l_X +1}.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n(-1)^L_final * [ (-1)^{l_X +1} ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n(-1)^{L_final + l_X +1} = 1.\n\nWhich implies that L_final + l_X + 1 must be even.\n\nSo,\n\nL_final + l_X = even -1 \u2192 which would be odd.\n\nWait, because (-1)^n = 1 if n is even, -1 if n is odd.\n\nSo for the product to be 1, the exponent must be even. So,\n\nL_final + l_X +1 \u2261 0 mod 2.\n\nSo,\n\n(L_final + l_X +1) mod 2 = 0.\n\nWhich implies that (L_final + l_X) mod 2 = 1.\n\nSo L_final and l_X have opposite parity.\n\nNow, the other condition is the Pauli statistics condition. The problem states that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.\n\nWait, the Pauli condition says that the sum T + S + L must be even (since it's equal to 0 mod 2, because T=0). So,\n\n0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L = 1 mod 2.\n\nSo S and L must be of opposite parity.\n\nSo, for the final NN state, S_final and L_final must add to 1 mod 2.\n\nBut the initial state has S_initial = 0, L_initial = 0, so J_initial = 0.\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0, which is (2S+1) L J. So S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWhen the NN emits X, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the total angular momentum before emission (J_initial =0) must equal the total angular momentum after emission (J_final = J_NN_final + J_X).\n\nBut since X is a spin-0 particle? Wait, the problem doesn't specify the spin of X. Hmm. Oh wait, X is emitted, but I'm not told its spin. Wait, but the question is about the angular momentum state of X, denoted by the lowercase letter. So for example, in option A, X is in a p state (which is l=1), so J_X would be the same as l_X, because spin is 0 (assuming X is spin-0, like a pion). So J_X = l_X.\n\nWait, but the problem says that X has intrinsic parity -1. So if X is a spin-0 particle, its parity is (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nBut let's proceed. So the total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial J is 0, so the final J must also be 0.\n\nThe final J is the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum (J_NN_final) and X's angular momentum (J_X).\n\nSo,\n\nJ_NN_final + J_X = 0.\n\nBut J is a vector, so this implies that J_NN_final = -J_X.\n\nBut since J is a magnitude, this implies that J_NN_final = J_X. Because the magnitudes have to match, and the directions are opposite.\n\nWait, but wait, J is a vector sum. So if J_NN_final and J_X are vectors, their sum must be zero. So J_NN_final = - J_X.\n\nBut both J_NN_final and J_X are non-negative scalars (their magnitudes). So their magnitudes must be equal, but their directions opposite. So |J_NN_final| = |J_X|.\n\nSo, the magnitude of J_NN_final equals the magnitude of J_X.\n\nBut J_X is the angular momentum of X. Since X is emitted in a state with angular momentum l_X, and assuming it's spin-0 (like a pion), then J_X = l_X.\n\nSo, J_NN_final = l_X.\n\nBut wait, J_NN_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the sum of their orbital angular momentum (L_final) and their total spin (S_final). So,\n\nJ_NN_final = S_final + L_final (vectorially).\n\nBut for the magnitude, we have:\n\n|J_NN_final| = |S_final + L_final|.\n\nAssuming that S_final and L_final are aligned (which is the maximum case), |J_NN_final| = S_final + L_final.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify that they are aligned. However, for the sake of selection rules, perhaps we can assume that the maximum possible J is considered. But I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that the total J_NN_final must be equal to l_X.\n\nSo,\n\nS_final + L_final = l_X.\n\nBut S_final and L_final are quantum numbers, and their vector sum J_final can take values |S_final - L_final| to S_final + L_final in integer steps.\n\nBut since J_NN_final must equal l_X (as a magnitude), and J_X is l_X, then:\n\nJ_NN_final = l_X.\n\nSo,\n\n|S_final - L_final| \u2264 J_NN_final \u2264 S_final + L_final.\n\nBut J_NN_final = l_X.\n\nSo,\n\nl_X must be between |S_final - L_final| and S_final + L_final.\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the possible values for S and L.\n\nBut wait, the Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since T is 0, S + L must be 1 mod 2.\n\nSo, S and L must have opposite parities. That is, one is even and the other is odd.\n\nSo, S and L must differ in parity.\n\nSo, for each option, I need to find out what L_final and l_X are, then check whether the parity condition holds (L_final + l_X is odd), and whether the Pauli condition holds (S_final and L_final have opposite parity).\n\nWait, but what is S_final? The initial state has S_initial =0. The NN system emits a particle X, so their total spin S_final could change, depending on how the interaction occurs. But wait, the emission of X would involve the NN system's spin and orbital angular momentum. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the initial state, the NN is in S=0 and L=0, so J=0. After emission, the NN's state will have some S_final and L_final, and their sum J_NN_final must combine with J_X to give J_total =0.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed with the spin part. Maybe it's better to approach each option one by one.\n\nLet's list the options:\n\nA) 1S0 \u21927D1 + p\n\nB) 1S0 \u21923S1 + p\n\nC) 1S0 \u21923D3 + f\n\nD) 1S0 \u21923P0 + s\n\nIn each case, the final NN state is given as, for example, 7D1. Wait, no, the notation is (2S+1)L J. So, for option A: 7D1. So 7 = 2S+1 \u2192 S=3. L is D, which is 2. J is 1.\n\nSimilarly for the others:\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L=S \u2192 L=0 (since S=0 for S state). Wait, no, the term is 3S1. So L is S, which is 0. So L=0. J is 1.\n\nOption C:3D3 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is D \u2192 2. J=3.\n\nOption D:3P0 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is P \u21921. J=0.\n\nWait, but for each option, the final NN state has certain S, L, J.\n\nSo for each option:\n\nOption A: S_final =3, L_final=2, J_final=1.\n\nOption B: S_final=1, L_final=0, J_final=1.\n\nOption C: S_final=1, L_final=2, J_final=3.\n\nOption D: S_final=1, L_final=1, J_final=0.\n\nNow, the emitted particle X has a certain l_X (denoted by the lowercase letter), which is the orbital angular momentum state of X.\n\nIn the options, the emitted X is:\n\nA) p \u2192 l=1.\n\nB) p \u2192 l=1.\n\nC) f \u2192 l=3.\n\nD) s \u2192 l=0.\n\nSo, for each option, l_X is known.\n\nNow, let's compute the parity condition.\n\nParity condition: (-1)^L_final * [ (-1)^{l_X +1} ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n(-1)^{L_final + l_X +1} = 1.\n\nWhich means that L_final + l_X +1 must be even.\n\nSo,\n\n(L_final + l_X +1) mod 2 = 0 \u2192 (L_final + l_X) mod 2 = 1.\n\nSo L_final and l_X must have opposite parity.\n\nSo let's compute for each option:\n\nOption A: L_final =2, l_X=1.\n\n2 +1 =3 \u2192 odd \u2192 satisfies condition.\n\nSo parity condition holds.\n\nPauli condition: T=0 = S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nSo S + L must be 1 mod 2.\n\nIn option A: S_final=3, L_final=2.\n\n3 +2=5 \u2192 mod2=1 \u2192 satisfies.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied. So this option is allowed.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l_X=1.\n\n0 +1 =1 \u2192 odd \u2192 parity condition holds.\n\nPauli condition: S=1, L=0 \u2192 1 +0=1 \u2192 mod2=1 \u2192 holds.\n\nSo allowed.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l_X=3.\n\n2+3=5 \u2192 odd \u2192 parity condition holds.\n\nPauli condition: S=1, L=2 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 mod2=1 \u2192 holds.\n\nSo allowed.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l_X=0.\n\n1+0=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 parity condition holds.\n\nPauli condition: S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 mod2=0 \u2192 does not equal 1. So this would not satisfy the Pauli condition.\n\nWait, the Pauli condition says T= S + L +1 mod2. So T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L =1 mod2.\n\nIn option D: S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 mod2=0. So 0 = 0 +1 \u2192 0=1? No, that doesn't hold. So the Pauli condition is not satisfied for option D.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nThe condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. T is given as 0.\n\nSo,\n\n0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod2.\n\nSo in option D: S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u22610 mod2. So 0 \u22611 \u2192 which is false.\n\nSo this violates the Pauli condition. Therefore, option D is not allowed.\n\nBut wait, the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So option D is not permitted.\n\nWait, but wait, is that all? Because the angular momentum must be conserved.\n\nLet me think about the angular momentum conservation.\n\nThe initial J is 0.\n\nThe final state is J_NN_final and J_X.\n\nSo,\n\nJ_NN_final + J_X =0 \u2192 J_NN_final = -J_X.\n\nBut J is a magnitude, so |J_NN_final| = |J_X|.\n\nNow, J_X is the angular momentum of X, which is l_X because X is spin-0 (assuming that, as in the case of pion).\n\nSo J_X = l_X.\n\nSo J_NN_final = l_X.\n\nBut J_NN_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the sum of their spin (S_final) and orbital angular momentum (L_final).\n\nSo,\n\n|J_NN_final| = | S_final + L_final |.\n\nBut wait, J_NN_final is a vector, so the magnitude can vary between |S_final - L_final| and S_final + L_final.\n\nBut for J_NN_final to equal l_X, l_X must be within that range.\n\nSo, for each option, check if l_X is between |S_final - L_final| and S_final + L_final.\n\nOption A:\n\nS_final=3, L_final=2. So J_NN_final can range from |3-2|=1 to 3+2=5. l_X=1. 1 is within [1,5], so possible.\n\nOption B:\n\nS_final=1, L_final=0. So J can be 1 to 1+0=1. So J=1. l_X=1. So yes.\n\nOption C:\n\nS_final=1, L_final=2. J can be |1-2|=1 to 1+2=3. l_X=3. 3 is within [1,3], so yes.\n\nOption D:\n\nS_final=1, L_final=1. So J can be |1-1|=0 to 1+1=2. l_X=0. 0 is within [0,2], so yes.\n\nWait, but in option D, the J_NN_final would be 0, since J_X is 0.\n\nSo in this case, J_NN_final =0, which is allowed since J can be 0.\n\nSo, angular momentum is conserved.\n\nBut the Pauli condition isn't satisfied for option D, so it's not allowed.\n\nWait, but what about the other options? Let me check each one.\n\nWait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So looking at the options, D is the only one that fails the Pauli condition.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn option D: the final NN state is 3P0.\n\nSo S_final=1, L_final=1. So S=1, L=1.\n\nPauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod2.\n\nT=0, so 0 = 1 +1 +1 mod2 \u2192 0 = 3 mod2 \u2192 0=1, which is false.\n\nSo the Pauli condition is not satisfied for option D. Therefore, this partial wave is not allowed.\n\nThus, the answer is option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about quantum mechanics, specifically dealing with nucleons, angular momentum, and parity. But I'll try to take it step by step.\n\nThe question says that we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted based on conservation laws.\n\nHmm. So, let's break down what I know. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, 2S+1 = 1 implies S=0 (since 2*0 +1=1). L is S in the term symbol, which is S here. Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0: 2S+1=1 \u2192 S=0, L is S? No, wait no. Wait, the term symbol is written as (2S+1)L J^P. So 1S0 would be (2S+1)=1 \u2192 S=0. L is S? No, no, wait. Oh, no, no, no. I think I'm getting confused. Let me think. The term symbol is (2S+1) L (J), where L is the orbital angular momentum in spectroscopic notation. So, for example, S is 0, P is 1, D is 2, etc.\n\nSo the initial state is 1S0. So S=0, L=0 (since it's S, which is 0), and J=0. Because J is the total angular momentum, which is S + L. Since both are 0, J is 0.\n\nNow, the NN system emits a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the initial state is the NN in 1S0, and the final state is NN in some state plus X.\n\nThe question is about the partial waves allowed. Each option gives a transition from 1S0 to another state plus a particle X with a specific angular momentum state. The options are A) 7D1 + p, B)3S1 + p, C)3D3 + f, D)3P0 + s.\n\nWait, the letters after the numbers in the options are the particles emitted. For example, option A is 7D1 plus p, which I think means that X is a p (a particle with orbital angular momentum l=1, since p is P state). Similarly, f would be l=3, s is l=0.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that X has intrinsic parity -1. So I need to remember the parity of the emitted particle. The parity of a particle is given by (-1)^(l+1), where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the emitted particle's state. Or wait, no, the parity of the emitted particle X is given as intrinsic parity -1. So for a particle emitted in an l state, its parity is (-1)^(l+1). Because the parity of a state with orbital angular momentum l is (-1)^l, but for a particle, the intrinsic parity is (-1)^(l+1) if it's a boson? Wait, maybe I should think again.\n\nWait, for a meson or a boson, the intrinsic parity is (-1)^(l) for orbital angular momentum l. Or wait, no. Let me clarify. For a particle emitted via a transition, the parity of the emitted particle is determined by the parity operator acting on it. For a spin-0 particle (like a pion), the parity is intrinsic. The pion, for example, has intrinsic parity -1. But in this case, the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1. So regardless of its orbital state, its parity is -1. Wait, no, no. The parity of a particle in a state with orbital angular momentum l is given by (-1)^{l} times its intrinsic parity. Because when you have orbital angular momentum, the parity is (-1)^l times the intrinsic parity.\n\nWait, the intrinsic parity is a property of the particle itself, independent of its orbital state. So for example, a pion (spin 0) has intrinsic parity -1. So if the pion is emitted in an orbital state with l, then its total parity would be (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So when it's emitted in an orbital state with angular momentum l, the parity of X is (-1)^{l} * (-1) = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me take a step back.\n\nThe initial state is NN in 1S0, which has certain parity. The final state is NN in another state plus X. So the parity of the initial state is the parity of the NN system. The parity of the final state should be the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X, since parity is multiplicative.\n\nWait, no. Let me think about parity conservation. The parity of the initial state should equal the parity of the final state, because parity is a conserved quantity in strong interactions (but not in weak). Since this is a strong interaction process (emitting a pion or something), parity is conserved.\n\nSo, initial parity of NN is the parity of the 1S0 state. For a two-nucleon system, the parity is given by (-1)^L * (intrinsic parity of nucleon)^2. Wait, each nucleon is a fermion, so their intrinsic parity is -1. So the intrinsic parity of the NN system is (-1) * (-1) = +1. The orbital part is (-1)^L. So the parity of the initial state is (-1)^L_initial * (intrinsic parity of NN system). Wait, no. Wait, the parity of a two-body system is given by the product of the intrinsic parities of each particle and (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum between them.\n\nSo each nucleon has intrinsic parity -1. So the product is (-1) * (-1) = 1. Then multiply by (-1)^L_initial. Initial state is L=0 (1S0), so parity is 1 * (-1)^0 = 1.\n\nSo the initial parity is +1.\n\nThe final state is the NN system in some state plus X. The parity of the final state must be the same as the initial, which is +1.\n\nThe parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN final state and the parity of X.\n\nWait, no. Because the final state is the NN system plus X. So the parity of the entire system is the product of the parities of each part. But since we're considering the NN system as a separate entity and X as another, their parities multiply.\n\nSo parity_final = parity_NN_final * parity_X.\n\nBut the parity_NN_final is the parity of the NN state after emission, which is determined by their orbital angular momentum and their intrinsic parity. And parity_X is the parity of the emitted particle.\n\nSo parity_NN_final = (-1)^L_final * (intrinsic parity of NN system).\n\nWait, the NN system's intrinsic parity is (each nucleon's parity is -1) \u2192 (-1)*(-1) = +1. So parity_NN_final = (-1)^L_final * 1 = (-1)^L_final.\n\nSo parity_final = [ (-1)^L_final ] * [ parity_X ].\n\nAnd since parity_final must equal initial parity (which is +1), we have:\n\n(-1)^L_final * parity_X = 1.\n\nSo, (-1)^L_final * parity_X = 1.\n\nWe also know that X has intrinsic parity -1, but wait, the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is (-1)^l_X * (intrinsic parity of X), where l_X is the orbital angular momentum of X. But wait, in this context, when X is emitted, it's in a state with orbital angular momentum l, so its parity is (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) because intrinsic parity is -1. So parity_X = (-1)^{l_X +1}.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n(-1)^L_final * [ (-1)^{l_X +1} ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n(-1)^{L_final + l_X +1} = 1.\n\nWhich implies that L_final + l_X + 1 must be even.\n\nSo,\n\nL_final + l_X = even -1 \u2192 which would be odd.\n\nWait, because (-1)^n = 1 if n is even, -1 if n is odd.\n\nSo for the product to be 1, the exponent must be even. So,\n\nL_final + l_X +1 \u2261 0 mod 2.\n\nSo,\n\n(L_final + l_X +1) mod 2 = 0.\n\nWhich implies that (L_final + l_X) mod 2 = 1.\n\nSo L_final and l_X have opposite parity.\n\nNow, the other condition is the Pauli statistics condition. The problem states that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.\n\nWait, the Pauli condition says that the sum T + S + L must be even (since it's equal to 0 mod 2, because T=0). So,\n\n0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L = 1 mod 2.\n\nSo S and L must be of opposite parity.\n\nSo, for the final NN state, S_final and L_final must add to 1 mod 2.\n\nBut the initial state has S_initial = 0, L_initial = 0, so J_initial = 0.\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0, which is (2S+1) L J. So S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nWhen the NN emits X, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the total angular momentum before emission (J_initial =0) must equal the total angular momentum after emission (J_final = J_NN_final + J_X).\n\nBut since X is a spin-0 particle? Wait, the problem doesn't specify the spin of X. Hmm. Oh wait, X is emitted, but I'm not told its spin. Wait, but the question is about the angular momentum state of X, denoted by the lowercase letter. So for example, in option A, X is in a p state (which is l=1), so J_X would be the same as l_X, because spin is 0 (assuming X is spin-0, like a pion). So J_X = l_X.\n\nWait, but the problem says that X has intrinsic parity -1. So if X is a spin-0 particle, its parity is (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nBut let's proceed. So the total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial J is 0, so the final J must also be 0.\n\nThe final J is the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum (J_NN_final) and X's angular momentum (J_X).\n\nSo,\n\nJ_NN_final + J_X = 0.\n\nBut J is a vector, so this implies that J_NN_final = -J_X.\n\nBut since J is a magnitude, this implies that J_NN_final = J_X. Because the magnitudes have to match, and the directions are opposite.\n\nWait, but wait, J is a vector sum. So if J_NN_final and J_X are vectors, their sum must be zero. So J_NN_final = - J_X.\n\nBut both J_NN_final and J_X are non-negative scalars (their magnitudes). So their magnitudes must be equal, but their directions opposite. So |J_NN_final| = |J_X|.\n\nSo, the magnitude of J_NN_final equals the magnitude of J_X.\n\nBut J_X is the angular momentum of X. Since X is emitted in a state with angular momentum l_X, and assuming it's spin-0 (like a pion), then J_X = l_X.\n\nSo, J_NN_final = l_X.\n\nBut wait, J_NN_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the sum of their orbital angular momentum (L_final) and their total spin (S_final). So,\n\nJ_NN_final = S_final + L_final (vectorially).\n\nBut for the magnitude, we have:\n\n|J_NN_final| = |S_final + L_final|.\n\nAssuming that S_final and L_final are aligned (which is the maximum case), |J_NN_final| = S_final + L_final.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify that they are aligned. However, for the sake of selection rules, perhaps we can assume that the maximum possible J is considered. But I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that the total J_NN_final must be equal to l_X.\n\nSo,\n\nS_final + L_final = l_X.\n\nBut S_final and L_final are quantum numbers, and their vector sum J_final can take values |S_final - L_final| to S_final + L_final in integer steps.\n\nBut since J_NN_final must equal l_X (as a magnitude), and J_X is l_X, then:\n\nJ_NN_final = l_X.\n\nSo,\n\n|S_final - L_final| \u2264 J_NN_final \u2264 S_final + L_final.\n\nBut J_NN_final = l_X.\n\nSo,\n\nl_X must be between |S_final - L_final| and S_final + L_final.\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the possible values for S and L.\n\nBut wait, the Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since T is 0, S + L must be 1 mod 2.\n\nSo, S and L must have opposite parities. That is, one is even and the other is odd.\n\nSo, S and L must differ in parity.\n\nSo, for each option, I need to find out what L_final and l_X are, then check whether the parity condition holds (L_final + l_X is odd), and whether the Pauli condition holds (S_final and L_final have opposite parity).\n\nWait, but what is S_final? The initial state has S_initial =0. The NN system emits a particle X, so their total spin S_final could change, depending on how the interaction occurs. But wait, the emission of X would involve the NN system's spin and orbital angular momentum. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the initial state, the NN is in S=0 and L=0, so J=0. After emission, the NN's state will have some S_final and L_final, and their sum J_NN_final must combine with J_X to give J_total =0.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed with the spin part. Maybe it's better to approach each option one by one.\n\nLet's list the options:\n\nA) 1S0 \u21927D1 + p\n\nB) 1S0 \u21923S1 + p\n\nC) 1S0 \u21923D3 + f\n\nD) 1S0 \u21923P0 + s\n\nIn each case, the final NN state is given as, for example, 7D1. Wait, no, the notation is (2S+1)L J. So, for option A: 7D1. So 7 = 2S+1 \u2192 S=3. L is D, which is 2. J is 1.\n\nSimilarly for the others:\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L=S \u2192 L=0 (since S=0 for S state). Wait, no, the term is 3S1. So L is S, which is 0. So L=0. J is 1.\n\nOption C:3D3 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is D \u2192 2. J=3.\n\nOption D:3P0 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is P \u21921. J=0.\n\nWait, but for each option, the final NN state has certain S, L, J.\n\nSo for each option:\n\nOption A: S_final =3, L_final=2, J_final=1.\n\nOption B: S_final=1, L_final=0, J_final=1.\n\nOption C: S_final=1, L_final=2, J_final=3.\n\nOption D: S_final=1, L_final=1, J_final=0.\n\nNow, the emitted particle X has a certain l_X (denoted by the lowercase letter), which is the orbital angular momentum state of X.\n\nIn the options, the emitted X is:\n\nA) p \u2192 l=1.\n\nB) p \u2192 l=1.\n\nC) f \u2192 l=3.\n\nD) s \u2192 l=0.\n\nSo, for each option, l_X is known.\n\nNow, let's compute the parity condition.\n\nParity condition: (-1)^L_final * [ (-1)^{l_X +1} ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n(-1)^{L_final + l_X +1} = 1.\n\nWhich means that L_final + l_X +1 must be even.\n\nSo,\n\n(L_final + l_X +1) mod 2 = 0 \u2192 (L_final + l_X) mod 2 = 1.\n\nSo L_final and l_X must have opposite parity.\n\nSo let's compute for each option:\n\nOption A: L_final =2, l_X=1.\n\n2 +1 =3 \u2192 odd \u2192 satisfies condition.\n\nSo parity condition holds.\n\nPauli condition: T=0 = S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nSo S + L must be 1 mod 2.\n\nIn option A: S_final=3, L_final=2.\n\n3 +2=5 \u2192 mod2=1 \u2192 satisfies.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied. So this option is allowed.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l_X=1.\n\n0 +1 =1 \u2192 odd \u2192 parity condition holds.\n\nPauli condition: S=1, L=0 \u2192 1 +0=1 \u2192 mod2=1 \u2192 holds.\n\nSo allowed.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l_X=3.\n\n2+3=5 \u2192 odd \u2192 parity condition holds.\n\nPauli condition: S=1, L=2 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 mod2=1 \u2192 holds.\n\nSo allowed.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l_X=0.\n\n1+0=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 parity condition holds.\n\nPauli condition: S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 mod2=0 \u2192 does not equal 1. So this would not satisfy the Pauli condition.\n\nWait, the Pauli condition says T= S + L +1 mod2. So T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L =1 mod2.\n\nIn option D: S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 mod2=0. So 0 = 0 +1 \u2192 0=1? No, that doesn't hold. So the Pauli condition is not satisfied for option D.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nThe condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. T is given as 0.\n\nSo,\n\n0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod2.\n\nSo in option D: S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u22610 mod2. So 0 \u22611 \u2192 which is false.\n\nSo this violates the Pauli condition. Therefore, option D is not allowed.\n\nBut wait, the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So option D is not permitted.\n\nWait, but wait, is that all? Because the angular momentum must be conserved.\n\nLet me think about the angular momentum conservation.\n\nThe initial J is 0.\n\nThe final state is J_NN_final and J_X.\n\nSo,\n\nJ_NN_final + J_X =0 \u2192 J_NN_final = -J_X.\n\nBut J is a magnitude, so |J_NN_final| = |J_X|.\n\nNow, J_X is the angular momentum of X, which is l_X because X is spin-0 (assuming that, as in the case of pion).\n\nSo J_X = l_X.\n\nSo J_NN_final = l_X.\n\nBut J_NN_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the sum of their spin (S_final) and orbital angular momentum (L_final).\n\nSo,\n\n|J_NN_final| = | S_final + L_final |.\n\nBut wait, J_NN_final is a vector, so the magnitude can vary between |S_final - L_final| and S_final + L_final.\n\nBut for J_NN_final to equal l_X, l_X must be within that range.\n\nSo, for each option, check if l_X is between |S_final - L_final| and S_final + L_final.\n\nOption A:\n\nS_final=3, L_final=2. So J_NN_final can range from |3-2|=1 to 3+2=5. l_X=1. 1 is within [1,5], so possible.\n\nOption B:\n\nS_final=1, L_final=0. So J can be 1 to 1+0=1. So J=1. l_X=1. So yes.\n\nOption C:\n\nS_final=1, L_final=2. J can be |1-2|=1 to 1+2=3. l_X=3. 3 is within [1,3], so yes.\n\nOption D:\n\nS_final=1, L_final=1. So J can be |1-1|=0 to 1+1=2. l_X=0. 0 is within [0,2], so yes.\n\nWait, but in option D, the J_NN_final would be 0, since J_X is 0.\n\nSo in this case, J_NN_final =0, which is allowed since J can be 0.\n\nSo, angular momentum is conserved.\n\nBut the Pauli condition isn't satisfied for option D, so it's not allowed.\n\nWait, but what about the other options? Let me check each one.\n\nWait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So looking at the options, D is the only one that fails the Pauli condition.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn option D: the final NN state is 3P0.\n\nSo S_final=1, L_final=1. So S=1, L=1.\n\nPauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod2.\n\nT=0, so 0 = 1 +1 +1 mod2 \u2192 0 = 3 mod2 \u2192 0=1, which is false.\n\nSo the Pauli condition is not satisfied for option D. Therefore, this partial wave is not allowed.\n\nThus, the answer is option D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions: conservation of parity and the Pauli statistics requirement that \\( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2) \\). The initial state is \\( 1S_0 \\), where \\( S = 0 \\), \\( L = 0 \\), and \\( J = 0 \\). The final state is the NN system in a new state plus a particle \\( X \\) with intrinsic parity \\(-1\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question is about a bound system of two nucleons (like protons or neutrons) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, which I remember have to do with the symmetry of the wavefunction for identical particles. The problem states that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nThe given condition is that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to find out which partial wave is not permitted based on the conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nThe options are A to D, each representing different transitions with different emitted particles. The lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X: p, s, etc. I think that refers to the orbital angular momentum quantum number l, where s is 0, p is 1, d is 2, f is 3, etc.\n\nWait, but the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X must be considered in the overall parity conservation.\n\nFirst, I should probably break down the problem into parts. Let's think about the initial state and the final state.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. That's the term symbol, which is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0: 2S+1 is 1, so S is 0. L is S (wait, no, wait. Term symbols are (2S+1)L J. So 1S0: 2S+1 = 1 \u2192 S=0. L is S? Wait, no, the L is the orbital angular momentum. So S is the spin, L is the orbital, and J is the total angular momentum. So for 1S0, S=0, L=0 (since S is the letter for orbital angular momentum? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the letters are in spectroscopic notation: S=0, P=1, D=2, F=3, etc. So in the term symbol, 1S0: the S is the orbital angular momentum part, so L=0. Because S corresponds to L=0. Wait, no. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0: 2S+1=1 \u2192 S=0. The L is given by the letter, S, which is L=0. So initial state has L=0, S=0, J=0 (since J is the total angular momentum, which is L + S when they're coupled). So J=0.\n\nThe initial state is NN in 1S0, so their spin is S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0, and total angular momentum J=0.\n\nThey emit a particle X. So the process is NN \u2192 NN' + X. Wait, no, the system is emitting a particle. So the initial state is the bound NN system, and after emitting X, the NN state becomes something else.\n\nWait, the question says the final NN state has T(NN)=0. But I'm a bit confused about what exactly is being considered here. The problem says that the system emits a particle X, so the initial state is NN in 1S0, and the final state is NN in some state plus X.\n\nBut the question is about the partial waves allowed. Each option gives a transition: for example, 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p. So the final NN state is 7D1, and X is a particle with angular momentum state p (which is l=1, since p corresponds to L=1). Or wait, the \"p\" in the option refers to the orbital angular momentum quantum number l of the emitted particle X.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X.\" So for example, in option A, it's 7D1 + p. So the emitted particle X has angular momentum state p, which is l=1.\n\nHmm. So for each option, the final NN state has some quantum numbers, and X has l as per the letter.\n\nNow, the problem requires that both angular momentum and parity are conserved.\n\nBut wait, in strong interactions (like emission of pions or other mesons), angular momentum and parity are conserved. But if X is a meson, which is a boson, then its spin and parity would have certain properties.\n\nWait, but the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. So parity of X is -1. Because intrinsic parity is the parity of the particle itself.\n\nSo the parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0, which is a state with L=0, so parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nThe final state is the NN state plus the emitted particle X.\n\nWait, but the parity of the entire system must be conserved. So the parity of the initial state (NN) is the same as the parity of the final state (NN' plus X). But since the emitted particle X is a boson, perhaps, and the NN' system is a nucleus, but the parity is a multiplicative quantum number.\n\nWait, the parity of the initial NN system is the parity of the state, which is 1S0, so L=0 \u2192 parity +1.\n\nThe final state consists of the new NN state (let's say with orbital angular momentum L') and the emitted particle X, which has orbital angular momentum l. So the parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X.\n\nWait, but the parity of a state is the product of the intrinsic parity of the particles and the parity from their spatial wavefunction.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the total parity of the entire system before and after.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is a bound NN system with parity +1. The final state is the NN' system (with some parity) plus X (with intrinsic parity -1 and orbital angular momentum l). So the total parity of the final state would be the product of the intrinsic parity of the NN' system, the intrinsic parity of X, and the spatial part parity from their angular momenta.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the orbital angular momentum part. The parity of the initial state is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. The parity of the final state is P_final = (-1)^L_final \u00d7 P_X_intrinsic \u00d7 P_NN'.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nThe initial parity is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. For the initial state, L_initial is 0 (since it's 1S0), so P_initial = +1.\n\nThe final state's parity must be the same, so P_initial = P_final.\n\nThe final state is the NN' state (which has its own orbital angular momentum L_NN') and the emitted particle X, which has orbital angular momentum l_X. The total orbital angular momentum of the system would be L_NN' + l_X, but perhaps that's not directly needed here.\n\nWait, the parity of the final state is determined by the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of the X particle's state.\n\nThe parity of the X particle's state is (-1)^l_X \u00d7 intrinsic parity of X. Since X's intrinsic parity is given as -1, the parity of X's state is (-1)^l_X \u00d7 (-1) = (-1)^(l_X + 1).\n\nThe parity of the NN' state is (-1)^{L_NN'}, because the intrinsic parity of the NN system is +1 (since each nucleon is a fermion with intrinsic parity +1, but as a pair, their intrinsic parity is (+1)^2 = +1, but wait, no. Wait, parity is a multiplicative quantum number. For a system of two identical particles, the intrinsic parity is the product of their individual intrinsic parities. But for identical fermions, their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric, so their spatial part must have a certain parity.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of the problem differently. Since the initial parity is +1, the final parity must also be +1. The final parity is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X's state.\n\nSo, P_final = P_NN' \u00d7 P_X.\n\nP_NN' is (-1)^{L_NN'}, and P_X is (-1)^{l_X} \u00d7 intrinsic parity of X.\n\nGiven that X's intrinsic parity is -1, P_X = (-1)^{l_X} \u00d7 (-1) = (-1)^{l_X + 1}.\n\nSo, P_final = (-1)^{L_NN'} \u00d7 (-1)^{l_X + 1} }.\n\nThis must equal P_initial = 1.\n\nSo:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN' + l_X + 1} } = 1.\n\nWhich implies that L_NN' + l_X + 1 must be even. So:\n\nL_NN' + l_X + 1 \u2261 0 mod 2 \u2192 L_NN' + l_X \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nSo L_NN' + l_X must be odd.\n\nThat's one condition.\n\nNext, angular momentum must be conserved. The initial total angular momentum is J_initial, which for the 1S0 state is 0. The final state's total angular momentum must also be 0, because angular momentum is conserved. But wait, no, that's only true if the process is via a contact interaction (like in the S-wave), but in general, the initial and final states must have the same total angular momentum if angular momentum is conserved. Wait, but when a particle is emitted, the total angular momentum is the sum of the initial state's J and the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle, but I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0, and the final state's angular momentum must also be 0. So the final state's NN' system has angular momentum J_NN' and the emitted X has angular momentum l_X (since X is a boson, I think, so its spin is included in the orbital part?), but wait, I'm not sure about the spin here.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l_X, and the spin of X is separate. But in this problem, since X is emitted, its total angular momentum would be the sum of its orbital and spin angular momenta. But the problem states that X's intrinsic parity is -1. For spin-0 particles, parity is (-1)^L. For spin-1, parity is (-1)^L multiplied by the spin factor, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is treating X as a spin-0 particle, so its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum l_X. Alternatively, maybe X is a pion, which is a pseudoscalar (spin 0, parity -1). So in that case, X's total angular momentum is just l_X, since its spin is 0.\n\nSo, the initial state has angular momentum J_initial = 0.\n\nThe final state consists of the NN' system with angular momentum J_NN' and the emitted X with angular momentum l_X. But since the total angular momentum must be conserved, the sum of J_NN' and l_X must equal J_initial, which is 0. But wait, angular momentum is a vector, so the sum could be any value, but in this case, the initial J is zero, so the final J must also be zero. So the possible values would be that J_NN' and l_X combine to give J_total = 0.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is l_X, and the total orbital angular momentum of the system is L_NN' + l_X. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, another approach: the initial state has orbital angular momentum L_initial = 0. The final state has orbital angular momentum L_NN' (for the NN' system) and the orbital angular momentum of X, l_X. So the total orbital angular momentum is L_NN' + l_X. But since the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the final orbital angular momentum must also be zero? No, because orbital angular momentum is part of the total angular momentum, but the initial state's total angular momentum is zero, but the orbital part is zero. The spin part is zero as well because the NN system is in S=0 state.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the angular momentum conservation in terms of the total J. The initial state has J_initial = 0. The final state must have J_final = 0.\n\nThe final state's J_final is the vector sum of the NN' system's J_NN' and the X's angular momentum J_X. But J_X would be the sum of X's orbital angular momentum l_X and its spin. But if X is a spin-0 particle, then J_X = l_X. So the total J_final is the vector sum of J_NN' and l_X. For this to be zero, J_NN' must be equal and opposite to l_X, but since angular momentum is quantized, the only possibility is that J_NN' = 0 and l_X = 0, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no, because the sum could be zero even if individual components are not zero, but their vector sum is zero. But perhaps that's getting too detailed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the orbital angular momentum only, since the spin part is handled by the Pauli exclusion principle condition given.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.\n\nWait, T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So the equation is T = S + L + 1 mod 2.\n\nThe final NN state has T=0. So substituting, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L = odd.\n\nSo S and L must have opposite parity. So if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.\n\nSo for the final state, S_NN' + L_NN' must be odd.\n\nNow, each option gives the final NN state. Let's look at the options.\n\nEach option's final state is given as something like 7D1. So let's parse each option:\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nThe final NN state is 7D1. So the term symbol is (2S'+1)L' J'.\n\nWait, no, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So 7D1: 2S+1=7 \u2192 S'=3 (since 2*3+1=7). L is D, which is 2. J is 1.\n\nWait, no, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So for 7D1, S=3 (since 2S+1=7), L=2 (D), J=1.\n\nSo for the final NN state in option A: S=3, L=2, J=1.\n\nSo S + L = 3 + 2 =5 \u2192 5 mod 2 is 1. So it's odd, which satisfies the condition S + L = 1 mod 2. So T=0 is allowed.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps one of the options doesn't satisfy either the parity condition or the angular momentum condition.\n\nLet me go through each option.\n\nFirst, the parity condition. For each option, I'll compute whether L_NN' + l_X is odd, as earlier.\n\nAlso, I'll check the angular momentum condition, whether the total J is conserved.\n\nWait, but perhaps the angular momentum conservation applies to the orbital part. Let me think again. The initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial=0. The final orbital angular momentum is L_NN' (the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system) plus l_X (the orbital angular momentum of X). So L_initial = L_NN' + l_X \u2192 0 = L_NN' + l_X \u2192 L_NN' + l_X = 0 mod something. Wait, but orbital angular momentum is a vector, so the sum must be zero. But perhaps in terms of quantum numbers, the possible values are such that L_NN' + l_X must be zero. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial=0. The final orbital angular momentum is the sum of the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system (L_NN') and that of X (l_X). So L_initial = L_NN' + l_X. But since L_initial is 0, L_NN' + l_X must be zero. But how is that possible? Because L and l are non-negative integers. So the only possibility is that L_NN' = 0 and l_X =0, or perhaps considering that the sum can have a magnitude of zero, but that's only possible if both are zero.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the options, X is emitted with l_X=1 (p), 1 (s?), wait, the options have lowercase letters: p is l=1, s is l=0, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: emitted particle is p \u2192 l_X=1.\n\nOption B: emitted particle is p \u2192 l_X=1.\n\nOption C: emitted particle is f \u2192 l_X=3.\n\nOption D: emitted particle is s \u2192 l_X=0.\n\nSo for each option, let's compute L_NN' and l_X.\n\nWait, the final NN state's orbital angular momentum is given in the term symbol. For example, in option A, the final state is 7D1. The L in the term symbol is D, which is 2. So L_NN'=2.\n\nSo for option A:\n\nL_NN' = 2, l_X =1 (p). So 2 +1=3, which is odd. So parity condition is satisfied because L_NN' + l_X =3 \u2192 odd.\n\nSo parity is (-1)^(2 + 1 +1) = (-1)^4=1, which matches initial parity of 1. Wait, earlier I had the condition that L_NN' + l_X must be odd, which it is (3), so the parity condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, the angular momentum condition: initial orbital angular momentum is 0, so 2 +1 =3. But wait, that's not zero. So how does that work? Because the orbital angular momentum of the system must be conserved. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle and the NN' system must sum to zero. So L_NN' + l_X = 0. But since they are both positive integers, the only way is if L_NN' = l_X =0. But in option A, L_NN' is 2, l_X is 1. So 2+1=3, which is not zero. That suggests that the angular momentum isn't conserved. But that can't be right because angular momentum must be conserved.\n\nWait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. The orbital angular momentum of the system (NN') and the emitted X must sum to the initial orbital angular momentum, which is 0.\n\nSo, L_NN' + l_X = 0 \u2192 but since L and l are magnitudes, this can't be unless both are zero. So if either is non-zero, the sum can't be zero. So this suggests that the orbital angular momentum can't be non-zero. So the only allowed emission is when L_NN' and l_X are both zero, making their sum zero.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the emitted particle must have l_X=0 (s-state emission), and the final NN' state must have L=0. But looking at the options, that's only the case for option D: 3P0. Let me check.\n\nOption D: 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s.\n\nThe final NN state is 3P0. So the term symbol is (2S+1)L J \u2192 3P0 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is P, which is 1. J=0.\n\nSo L_NN' =1, l_X=0 (s). So 1+0=1, which is not zero. So the sum is 1, which doesn't match the initial L=0. So this would violate angular momentum conservation.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The initial state's orbital angular momentum is zero. So the sum of the final orbital angular momenta must also be zero. But in option D, L_NN' is 1 and l_X is 0 \u2192 sum is 1, which is not zero. So this would not conserve angular momentum. So option D would be forbidden.\n\nBut wait, the options are giving the transitions, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is conserved as a vector, but that complicates things because we have to consider possible couplings. But given that the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the only way the sum can be zero is if L_NN' and l_X are such that their vector sum is zero. But for that to happen, L_NN' must equal l_X and in opposite directions. But quantum mechanically, that's only possible if L_NN' = l_X, and their sum can be zero if the orbital angular momentum is in opposite directions, but this is only possible if L_NN' and l_X are zero. Because any non-zero value would require their vector sum to have a non-zero magnitude. Therefore, the only allowed transitions are those where L_NN' = l_X =0.\n\nWait, but that's not the case in any of the options except maybe none. Let me check each option.\n\nOption A: L_NN' =2, l_X=1 \u2192 2+1=3 \u2192 sum can't be zero. So angular momentum not conserved.\n\nOption B: Let's see. The final state is 3S1. So term symbol (2S+1)L J =3S1 \u2192 S=1 (since 2*1+1=3), L=S\u2192 wait, no, the L is given by the letter. S is L=0. So L_NN' =0. X is p \u2192 l_X=1.\n\nSo L_NN'=0, l_X=1 \u2192 sum is 1, not zero. So angular momentum not conserved.\n\nOption C: final state is 3D3. So L is D \u2192 2. X is f \u2192 l_X=3.\n\nSum is 2+3=5 \u2192 not zero. So angular momentum not conserved.\n\nOption D: final state is 3P0 \u2192 L is P \u21921. X is s \u2192 l_X=0. Sum is 1+0=1 \u2192 not zero. So angular momentum not conserved.\n\nWait a minute, that's strange. All options except none have sum zero. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: The initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the final NN' and X must also be zero. So L_NN' + l_X =0. But that's only possible if both are zero. Because L and l are non-negative integers. So the only possible way is L_NN'=0 and l_X=0.\n\nSo the only allowed emission is when the final NN' state has L=0 and X is emitted in l=0 (s-state).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nWhich options have L_NN'=0 and l_X=0?\n\nOption B: final state is 3S1. L=0. X is p \u2192 l_X=1. So 0+1=1 \u2192 not zero. So not allowed.\n\nOption D: final state is 3P0. L=1. X is s \u2192 l_X=0. 1+0=1 \u2192 not zero. Not allowed.\n\nOption A: L=2, X l=1 \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: L=2, X l=3 \u2192 sum 5 \u2192 no.\n\nSo none of the options have L_NN' =0 and l_X=0. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is not l_X, but the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system plus the X's orbital angular momentum must sum to the initial orbital angular momentum, which is zero. So L_NN' + l_X =0 \u2192 which implies L_NN' = l_X =0.\n\nSo the only allowed emission is when L_NN' =0 and l_X=0. So looking at the options, which one has L_NN'=0 and l_X=0?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 L=0. X is p \u2192 l=1 \u2192 sum 1 \u2192 no.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 L=1. X is s \u2192 l=0 \u2192 sum 1 \u2192 no.\n\nOption A: L=2, X l=1 \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: L=2, X l=3 \u2192 sum 5 \u2192 no.\n\nSo none of the options satisfy L_NN' + l_X=0. So that suggests that all options are forbidden, which can't be right because the question states that one is not permitted.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I'm calculating the sum. Maybe the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is not l_X, but perhaps it's the orbital angular momentum of the two-body (NN') system. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the parity and angular momentum conservation together.\n\nWait, the problem also mentions that the Pauli statistics require T = S + L +1 mod 2. So for each option, let's compute T, S, L for the final NN' state and see if T=0 is allowed.\n\nBut the problem states that the final NN' state has T=0. So for each option, I can check whether T=0 is possible based on S and L.\n\nFor option A: final state is 7D1 \u2192 S=3, L=2.\n\nSo S=3, L=2 \u2192 S + L =5 \u2192 5 mod 2 =1. So T= S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 3+2+1=6 \u2192 6 mod2=0. So T=0 is allowed. So this option is allowed.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 S=1, L=0.\n\nS + L =1 \u2192 mod 2 is 1. So T=1+0+1=2 \u2192 mod2=0. So T=0 is allowed.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 S=1, L=2.\n\nS + L=3 \u2192 mod2=1. So T=1+2+1=4 \u2192 mod2=0. So allowed.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 S=1, L=1.\n\nS + L=2 \u2192 mod2=0. So T=1+1+1=3 \u2192 mod2=1. But the problem says T=0, so this option would have T=1, which doesn't match the condition. So option D's final state doesn't satisfy T=0. Therefore, option D is not permitted.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the angular momentum condition wasn't met, but perhaps the problem is more about the T condition.\n\nWait, the problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So for option D, T=1, which doesn't match. So that would make option D not allowed.\n\nBut earlier, when considering angular momentum, I thought that all options have L_NN' + l_X not zero. But perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the angular momentum is conserved via the total J. The initial state has J=0. The final state's J must be 0. So the vector sum of J_NN' and J_X must be zero. J_X is the spin of X plus its orbital angular momentum. But if X is a spin-0 particle, then J_X = l_X.\n\nSo, for the final state to have J=0, the sum of J_NN' and J_X must be zero. So J_NN' must equal J_X in magnitude and opposite in direction. But since they're quantum numbers, this implies that J_NN' = J_X, and their vector sum is zero. But this is only possible if J_NN' = J_X and they are opposite in direction, but this requires that J_NN' = J_X =0. So J_NN' must be zero, and J_X must be zero. So the final NN' state must have J=0, and the emitted X must have J=0.\n\nWait, but in the options, each final state has a J given in the term symbol.\n\nLet me check each option:\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 J=1.\n\nX is p (l=1). So J_X = l_X (since X is spin-0) \u2192 J_X=1.\n\nSo J_NN'=1, J_X=1. Can their vector sum be zero? Yes, if they are opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, the sum could be zero if they are in opposite directions. But this requires that the total angular momentum is zero, which is allowed.\n\nBut wait, for the initial state J=0, the final state's total J must also be zero. So the sum of J_NN' and J_X must be zero. So J_NN' must equal J_X, and their vector sum is zero, which is possible only if J_NN' = J_X and they are opposite. But in quantum terms, the only way their sum can be zero is if they are in a state where their angular momenta are opposite and equal. But in practice, this is only possible if J_NN' = J_X =0. Because for any higher J, the sum can't be zero unless they are opposite and equal, but that's not possible unless they are zero.\n\nWait, no. For example, if J_NN' is 1 and J_X is 1, their sum can be zero if they are in opposite directions. But in quantum mechanics, the possible total J can be |1-1| to 1+1, i.e., 0,1,2. So yes, it's possible for the sum to be zero. So option A's J_NN' =1 and J_X=1 could combine to zero.\n\nBut wait, the initial J is zero, so the final J must also be zero. So if J_NN' and J_X are both 1, they can combine to zero if they're in opposite directions. So that's allowed.\n\nBut let me check each option:\n\nOption A: J_NN' =1, J_X=1 \u2192 possible sum zero.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 J=1. X is p \u2192 J_X=1. So possible sum zero.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 J=3. X is f \u2192 l=3 \u2192 J_X=3. So sum could be zero if opposite.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 J=0. X is s \u2192 J_X=0. So sum is zero. So this is allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier when looking at the T condition, option D's final state has T=1, which doesn't match the required T=0. So that's a problem.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that option D's final state doesn't satisfy T=0, making it impossible. Therefore, option D is not permitted.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question is about a bound system of two nucleons (like protons or neutrons) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, which I remember have to do with the symmetry of the wavefunction for identical particles. The problem states that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nThe given condition is that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to find out which partial wave is not permitted based on the conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nThe options are A to D, each representing different transitions with different emitted particles. The lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X: p, s, etc. I think that refers to the orbital angular momentum quantum number l, where s is 0, p is 1, d is 2, f is 3, etc.\n\nWait, but the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X must be considered in the overall parity conservation.\n\nFirst, I should probably break down the problem into parts. Let's think about the initial state and the final state.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. That's the term symbol, which is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0: 2S+1 is 1, so S is 0. L is S (wait, no, wait. Term symbols are (2S+1)L J. So 1S0: 2S+1 = 1 \u2192 S=0. L is S? Wait, no, the L is the orbital angular momentum. So S is the spin, L is the orbital, and J is the total angular momentum. So for 1S0, S=0, L=0 (since S is the letter for orbital angular momentum? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the letters are in spectroscopic notation: S=0, P=1, D=2, F=3, etc. So in the term symbol, 1S0: the S is the orbital angular momentum part, so L=0. Because S corresponds to L=0. Wait, no. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0: 2S+1=1 \u2192 S=0. The L is given by the letter, S, which is L=0. So initial state has L=0, S=0, J=0 (since J is the total angular momentum, which is L + S when they're coupled). So J=0.\n\nThe initial state is NN in 1S0, so their spin is S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0, and total angular momentum J=0.\n\nThey emit a particle X. So the process is NN \u2192 NN' + X. Wait, no, the system is emitting a particle. So the initial state is the bound NN system, and after emitting X, the NN state becomes something else.\n\nWait, the question says the final NN state has T(NN)=0. But I'm a bit confused about what exactly is being considered here. The problem says that the system emits a particle X, so the initial state is NN in 1S0, and the final state is NN in some state plus X.\n\nBut the question is about the partial waves allowed. Each option gives a transition: for example, 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p. So the final NN state is 7D1, and X is a particle with angular momentum state p (which is l=1, since p corresponds to L=1). Or wait, the \"p\" in the option refers to the orbital angular momentum quantum number l of the emitted particle X.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X.\" So for example, in option A, it's 7D1 + p. So the emitted particle X has angular momentum state p, which is l=1.\n\nHmm. So for each option, the final NN state has some quantum numbers, and X has l as per the letter.\n\nNow, the problem requires that both angular momentum and parity are conserved.\n\nBut wait, in strong interactions (like emission of pions or other mesons), angular momentum and parity are conserved. But if X is a meson, which is a boson, then its spin and parity would have certain properties.\n\nWait, but the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. So parity of X is -1. Because intrinsic parity is the parity of the particle itself.\n\nSo the parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0, which is a state with L=0, so parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nThe final state is the NN state plus the emitted particle X.\n\nWait, but the parity of the entire system must be conserved. So the parity of the initial state (NN) is the same as the parity of the final state (NN' plus X). But since the emitted particle X is a boson, perhaps, and the NN' system is a nucleus, but the parity is a multiplicative quantum number.\n\nWait, the parity of the initial NN system is the parity of the state, which is 1S0, so L=0 \u2192 parity +1.\n\nThe final state consists of the new NN state (let's say with orbital angular momentum L') and the emitted particle X, which has orbital angular momentum l. So the parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X.\n\nWait, but the parity of a state is the product of the intrinsic parity of the particles and the parity from their spatial wavefunction.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the total parity of the entire system before and after.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is a bound NN system with parity +1. The final state is the NN' system (with some parity) plus X (with intrinsic parity -1 and orbital angular momentum l). So the total parity of the final state would be the product of the intrinsic parity of the NN' system, the intrinsic parity of X, and the spatial part parity from their angular momenta.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the orbital angular momentum part. The parity of the initial state is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. The parity of the final state is P_final = (-1)^L_final \u00d7 P_X_intrinsic \u00d7 P_NN'.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nThe initial parity is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. For the initial state, L_initial is 0 (since it's 1S0), so P_initial = +1.\n\nThe final state's parity must be the same, so P_initial = P_final.\n\nThe final state is the NN' state (which has its own orbital angular momentum L_NN') and the emitted particle X, which has orbital angular momentum l_X. The total orbital angular momentum of the system would be L_NN' + l_X, but perhaps that's not directly needed here.\n\nWait, the parity of the final state is determined by the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of the X particle's state.\n\nThe parity of the X particle's state is (-1)^l_X \u00d7 intrinsic parity of X. Since X's intrinsic parity is given as -1, the parity of X's state is (-1)^l_X \u00d7 (-1) = (-1)^(l_X + 1).\n\nThe parity of the NN' state is (-1)^{L_NN'}, because the intrinsic parity of the NN system is +1 (since each nucleon is a fermion with intrinsic parity +1, but as a pair, their intrinsic parity is (+1)^2 = +1, but wait, no. Wait, parity is a multiplicative quantum number. For a system of two identical particles, the intrinsic parity is the product of their individual intrinsic parities. But for identical fermions, their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric, so their spatial part must have a certain parity.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of the problem differently. Since the initial parity is +1, the final parity must also be +1. The final parity is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X's state.\n\nSo, P_final = P_NN' \u00d7 P_X.\n\nP_NN' is (-1)^{L_NN'}, and P_X is (-1)^{l_X} \u00d7 intrinsic parity of X.\n\nGiven that X's intrinsic parity is -1, P_X = (-1)^{l_X} \u00d7 (-1) = (-1)^{l_X + 1}.\n\nSo, P_final = (-1)^{L_NN'} \u00d7 (-1)^{l_X + 1} }.\n\nThis must equal P_initial = 1.\n\nSo:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN' + l_X + 1} } = 1.\n\nWhich implies that L_NN' + l_X + 1 must be even. So:\n\nL_NN' + l_X + 1 \u2261 0 mod 2 \u2192 L_NN' + l_X \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nSo L_NN' + l_X must be odd.\n\nThat's one condition.\n\nNext, angular momentum must be conserved. The initial total angular momentum is J_initial, which for the 1S0 state is 0. The final state's total angular momentum must also be 0, because angular momentum is conserved. But wait, no, that's only true if the process is via a contact interaction (like in the S-wave), but in general, the initial and final states must have the same total angular momentum if angular momentum is conserved. Wait, but when a particle is emitted, the total angular momentum is the sum of the initial state's J and the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle, but I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0, and the final state's angular momentum must also be 0. So the final state's NN' system has angular momentum J_NN' and the emitted X has angular momentum l_X (since X is a boson, I think, so its spin is included in the orbital part?), but wait, I'm not sure about the spin here.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l_X, and the spin of X is separate. But in this problem, since X is emitted, its total angular momentum would be the sum of its orbital and spin angular momenta. But the problem states that X's intrinsic parity is -1. For spin-0 particles, parity is (-1)^L. For spin-1, parity is (-1)^L multiplied by the spin factor, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is treating X as a spin-0 particle, so its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum l_X. Alternatively, maybe X is a pion, which is a pseudoscalar (spin 0, parity -1). So in that case, X's total angular momentum is just l_X, since its spin is 0.\n\nSo, the initial state has angular momentum J_initial = 0.\n\nThe final state consists of the NN' system with angular momentum J_NN' and the emitted X with angular momentum l_X. But since the total angular momentum must be conserved, the sum of J_NN' and l_X must equal J_initial, which is 0. But wait, angular momentum is a vector, so the sum could be any value, but in this case, the initial J is zero, so the final J must also be zero. So the possible values would be that J_NN' and l_X combine to give J_total = 0.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is l_X, and the total orbital angular momentum of the system is L_NN' + l_X. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, another approach: the initial state has orbital angular momentum L_initial = 0. The final state has orbital angular momentum L_NN' (for the NN' system) and the orbital angular momentum of X, l_X. So the total orbital angular momentum is L_NN' + l_X. But since the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the final orbital angular momentum must also be zero? No, because orbital angular momentum is part of the total angular momentum, but the initial state's total angular momentum is zero, but the orbital part is zero. The spin part is zero as well because the NN system is in S=0 state.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the angular momentum conservation in terms of the total J. The initial state has J_initial = 0. The final state must have J_final = 0.\n\nThe final state's J_final is the vector sum of the NN' system's J_NN' and the X's angular momentum J_X. But J_X would be the sum of X's orbital angular momentum l_X and its spin. But if X is a spin-0 particle, then J_X = l_X. So the total J_final is the vector sum of J_NN' and l_X. For this to be zero, J_NN' must be equal and opposite to l_X, but since angular momentum is quantized, the only possibility is that J_NN' = 0 and l_X = 0, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no, because the sum could be zero even if individual components are not zero, but their vector sum is zero. But perhaps that's getting too detailed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the orbital angular momentum only, since the spin part is handled by the Pauli exclusion principle condition given.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.\n\nWait, T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So the equation is T = S + L + 1 mod 2.\n\nThe final NN state has T=0. So substituting, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L = odd.\n\nSo S and L must have opposite parity. So if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.\n\nSo for the final state, S_NN' + L_NN' must be odd.\n\nNow, each option gives the final NN state. Let's look at the options.\n\nEach option's final state is given as something like 7D1. So let's parse each option:\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nThe final NN state is 7D1. So the term symbol is (2S'+1)L' J'.\n\nWait, no, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So 7D1: 2S+1=7 \u2192 S'=3 (since 2*3+1=7). L is D, which is 2. J is 1.\n\nWait, no, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So for 7D1, S=3 (since 2S+1=7), L=2 (D), J=1.\n\nSo for the final NN state in option A: S=3, L=2, J=1.\n\nSo S + L = 3 + 2 =5 \u2192 5 mod 2 is 1. So it's odd, which satisfies the condition S + L = 1 mod 2. So T=0 is allowed.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps one of the options doesn't satisfy either the parity condition or the angular momentum condition.\n\nLet me go through each option.\n\nFirst, the parity condition. For each option, I'll compute whether L_NN' + l_X is odd, as earlier.\n\nAlso, I'll check the angular momentum condition, whether the total J is conserved.\n\nWait, but perhaps the angular momentum conservation applies to the orbital part. Let me think again. The initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial=0. The final orbital angular momentum is L_NN' (the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system) plus l_X (the orbital angular momentum of X). So L_initial = L_NN' + l_X \u2192 0 = L_NN' + l_X \u2192 L_NN' + l_X = 0 mod something. Wait, but orbital angular momentum is a vector, so the sum must be zero. But perhaps in terms of quantum numbers, the possible values are such that L_NN' + l_X must be zero. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial=0. The final orbital angular momentum is the sum of the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system (L_NN') and that of X (l_X). So L_initial = L_NN' + l_X. But since L_initial is 0, L_NN' + l_X must be zero. But how is that possible? Because L and l are non-negative integers. So the only possibility is that L_NN' = 0 and l_X =0, or perhaps considering that the sum can have a magnitude of zero, but that's only possible if both are zero.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the options, X is emitted with l_X=1 (p), 1 (s?), wait, the options have lowercase letters: p is l=1, s is l=0, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: emitted particle is p \u2192 l_X=1.\n\nOption B: emitted particle is p \u2192 l_X=1.\n\nOption C: emitted particle is f \u2192 l_X=3.\n\nOption D: emitted particle is s \u2192 l_X=0.\n\nSo for each option, let's compute L_NN' and l_X.\n\nWait, the final NN state's orbital angular momentum is given in the term symbol. For example, in option A, the final state is 7D1. The L in the term symbol is D, which is 2. So L_NN'=2.\n\nSo for option A:\n\nL_NN' = 2, l_X =1 (p). So 2 +1=3, which is odd. So parity condition is satisfied because L_NN' + l_X =3 \u2192 odd.\n\nSo parity is (-1)^(2 + 1 +1) = (-1)^4=1, which matches initial parity of 1. Wait, earlier I had the condition that L_NN' + l_X must be odd, which it is (3), so the parity condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, the angular momentum condition: initial orbital angular momentum is 0, so 2 +1 =3. But wait, that's not zero. So how does that work? Because the orbital angular momentum of the system must be conserved. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle and the NN' system must sum to zero. So L_NN' + l_X = 0. But since they are both positive integers, the only way is if L_NN' = l_X =0. But in option A, L_NN' is 2, l_X is 1. So 2+1=3, which is not zero. That suggests that the angular momentum isn't conserved. But that can't be right because angular momentum must be conserved.\n\nWait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. The orbital angular momentum of the system (NN') and the emitted X must sum to the initial orbital angular momentum, which is 0.\n\nSo, L_NN' + l_X = 0 \u2192 but since L and l are magnitudes, this can't be unless both are zero. So if either is non-zero, the sum can't be zero. So this suggests that the orbital angular momentum can't be non-zero. So the only allowed emission is when L_NN' and l_X are both zero, making their sum zero.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the emitted particle must have l_X=0 (s-state emission), and the final NN' state must have L=0. But looking at the options, that's only the case for option D: 3P0. Let me check.\n\nOption D: 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s.\n\nThe final NN state is 3P0. So the term symbol is (2S+1)L J \u2192 3P0 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is P, which is 1. J=0.\n\nSo L_NN' =1, l_X=0 (s). So 1+0=1, which is not zero. So the sum is 1, which doesn't match the initial L=0. So this would violate angular momentum conservation.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The initial state's orbital angular momentum is zero. So the sum of the final orbital angular momenta must also be zero. But in option D, L_NN' is 1 and l_X is 0 \u2192 sum is 1, which is not zero. So this would not conserve angular momentum. So option D would be forbidden.\n\nBut wait, the options are giving the transitions, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is conserved as a vector, but that complicates things because we have to consider possible couplings. But given that the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the only way the sum can be zero is if L_NN' and l_X are such that their vector sum is zero. But for that to happen, L_NN' must equal l_X and in opposite directions. But quantum mechanically, that's only possible if L_NN' = l_X, and their sum can be zero if the orbital angular momentum is in opposite directions, but this is only possible if L_NN' and l_X are zero. Because any non-zero value would require their vector sum to have a non-zero magnitude. Therefore, the only allowed transitions are those where L_NN' = l_X =0.\n\nWait, but that's not the case in any of the options except maybe none. Let me check each option.\n\nOption A: L_NN' =2, l_X=1 \u2192 2+1=3 \u2192 sum can't be zero. So angular momentum not conserved.\n\nOption B: Let's see. The final state is 3S1. So term symbol (2S+1)L J =3S1 \u2192 S=1 (since 2*1+1=3), L=S\u2192 wait, no, the L is given by the letter. S is L=0. So L_NN' =0. X is p \u2192 l_X=1.\n\nSo L_NN'=0, l_X=1 \u2192 sum is 1, not zero. So angular momentum not conserved.\n\nOption C: final state is 3D3. So L is D \u2192 2. X is f \u2192 l_X=3.\n\nSum is 2+3=5 \u2192 not zero. So angular momentum not conserved.\n\nOption D: final state is 3P0 \u2192 L is P \u21921. X is s \u2192 l_X=0. Sum is 1+0=1 \u2192 not zero. So angular momentum not conserved.\n\nWait a minute, that's strange. All options except none have sum zero. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: The initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the final NN' and X must also be zero. So L_NN' + l_X =0. But that's only possible if both are zero. Because L and l are non-negative integers. So the only possible way is L_NN'=0 and l_X=0.\n\nSo the only allowed emission is when the final NN' state has L=0 and X is emitted in l=0 (s-state).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nWhich options have L_NN'=0 and l_X=0?\n\nOption B: final state is 3S1. L=0. X is p \u2192 l_X=1. So 0+1=1 \u2192 not zero. So not allowed.\n\nOption D: final state is 3P0. L=1. X is s \u2192 l_X=0. 1+0=1 \u2192 not zero. Not allowed.\n\nOption A: L=2, X l=1 \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: L=2, X l=3 \u2192 sum 5 \u2192 no.\n\nSo none of the options have L_NN' =0 and l_X=0. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is not l_X, but the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system plus the X's orbital angular momentum must sum to the initial orbital angular momentum, which is zero. So L_NN' + l_X =0 \u2192 which implies L_NN' = l_X =0.\n\nSo the only allowed emission is when L_NN' =0 and l_X=0. So looking at the options, which one has L_NN'=0 and l_X=0?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 L=0. X is p \u2192 l=1 \u2192 sum 1 \u2192 no.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 L=1. X is s \u2192 l=0 \u2192 sum 1 \u2192 no.\n\nOption A: L=2, X l=1 \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: L=2, X l=3 \u2192 sum 5 \u2192 no.\n\nSo none of the options satisfy L_NN' + l_X=0. So that suggests that all options are forbidden, which can't be right because the question states that one is not permitted.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I'm calculating the sum. Maybe the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is not l_X, but perhaps it's the orbital angular momentum of the two-body (NN') system. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the parity and angular momentum conservation together.\n\nWait, the problem also mentions that the Pauli statistics require T = S + L +1 mod 2. So for each option, let's compute T, S, L for the final NN' state and see if T=0 is allowed.\n\nBut the problem states that the final NN' state has T=0. So for each option, I can check whether T=0 is possible based on S and L.\n\nFor option A: final state is 7D1 \u2192 S=3, L=2.\n\nSo S=3, L=2 \u2192 S + L =5 \u2192 5 mod 2 =1. So T= S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 3+2+1=6 \u2192 6 mod2=0. So T=0 is allowed. So this option is allowed.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 S=1, L=0.\n\nS + L =1 \u2192 mod 2 is 1. So T=1+0+1=2 \u2192 mod2=0. So T=0 is allowed.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 S=1, L=2.\n\nS + L=3 \u2192 mod2=1. So T=1+2+1=4 \u2192 mod2=0. So allowed.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 S=1, L=1.\n\nS + L=2 \u2192 mod2=0. So T=1+1+1=3 \u2192 mod2=1. But the problem says T=0, so this option would have T=1, which doesn't match the condition. So option D's final state doesn't satisfy T=0. Therefore, option D is not permitted.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the angular momentum condition wasn't met, but perhaps the problem is more about the T condition.\n\nWait, the problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So for option D, T=1, which doesn't match. So that would make option D not allowed.\n\nBut earlier, when considering angular momentum, I thought that all options have L_NN' + l_X not zero. But perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the angular momentum is conserved via the total J. The initial state has J=0. The final state's J must be 0. So the vector sum of J_NN' and J_X must be zero. J_X is the spin of X plus its orbital angular momentum. But if X is a spin-0 particle, then J_X = l_X.\n\nSo, for the final state to have J=0, the sum of J_NN' and J_X must be zero. So J_NN' must equal J_X in magnitude and opposite in direction. But since they're quantum numbers, this implies that J_NN' = J_X, and their vector sum is zero. But this is only possible if J_NN' = J_X and they are opposite in direction, but this requires that J_NN' = J_X =0. So J_NN' must be zero, and J_X must be zero. So the final NN' state must have J=0, and the emitted X must have J=0.\n\nWait, but in the options, each final state has a J given in the term symbol.\n\nLet me check each option:\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 J=1.\n\nX is p (l=1). So J_X = l_X (since X is spin-0) \u2192 J_X=1.\n\nSo J_NN'=1, J_X=1. Can their vector sum be zero? Yes, if they are opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, the sum could be zero if they are in opposite directions. But this requires that the total angular momentum is zero, which is allowed.\n\nBut wait, for the initial state J=0, the final state's total J must also be zero. So the sum of J_NN' and J_X must be zero. So J_NN' must equal J_X, and their vector sum is zero, which is possible only if J_NN' = J_X and they are opposite. But in quantum terms, the only way their sum can be zero is if they are in a state where their angular momenta are opposite and equal. But in practice, this is only possible if J_NN' = J_X =0. Because for any higher J, the sum can't be zero unless they are opposite and equal, but that's not possible unless they are zero.\n\nWait, no. For example, if J_NN' is 1 and J_X is 1, their sum can be zero if they are in opposite directions. But in quantum mechanics, the possible total J can be |1-1| to 1+1, i.e., 0,1,2. So yes, it's possible for the sum to be zero. So option A's J_NN' =1 and J_X=1 could combine to zero.\n\nBut wait, the initial J is zero, so the final J must also be zero. So if J_NN' and J_X are both 1, they can combine to zero if they're in opposite directions. So that's allowed.\n\nBut let me check each option:\n\nOption A: J_NN' =1, J_X=1 \u2192 possible sum zero.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 J=1. X is p \u2192 J_X=1. So possible sum zero.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 J=3. X is f \u2192 l=3 \u2192 J_X=3. So sum could be zero if opposite.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 J=0. X is s \u2192 J_X=0. So sum is zero. So this is allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier when looking at the T condition, option D's final state has T=1, which doesn't match the required T=0. So that's a problem.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that option D's final state doesn't satisfy T=0, making it impossible. Therefore, option D is not permitted.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions: conservation of angular momentum, conservation of parity, and the Pauli statistics requirement that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy \\( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2) \\). The final NN state is given to have \\( T(NN) = 0 \\), and the emitted particle \\( X \\) has intrinsic parity \\(-1\\).\n\n### Key Analysis\n\n#### 1. **Initial State**\nThe initial state is \\( 1S_0 \\), which corresponds to:\n- \\( S = 0 \\) (total spin),\n- \\( L = 0 \\) (orbital angular momentum),\n- \\( J = 0 \\) (total angular momentum),\n- Parity \\( P = (-1)^L = +1 \\).\n\n#### 2. **Final State**\nThe final state consists of the NN system in a new state and the emitted particle \\( X \\). The parity of the final state must match the initial parity (\\( +1 \\)), and angular momentum must be conserved. Additionally, the Pauli statistics condition \\( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2) \\) must be satisfied for the final NN state.\n\n#### 3. **Parity Conservation**\nThe parity of the final state is given by:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{final}} = P_{NN'} \\cdot P_X,\n\\]\nwhere \\( P_{NN'} = (-1)^{L_{NN'}} \\) and \\( P_X = (-1)^{l_X} \\cdot (-1) \\) (since \\( X \\) has intrinsic parity \\(-1\\)). Thus:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{final}} = (-1)^{L_{NN'}} \\cdot (-1)^{l_X + 1}.\n\\]\nFor parity conservation (\\( P_{\\text{final}} = P_{\\text{initial}} = +1 \\)):\n\\[\n(-1)^{L_{NN'} + l_X + 1} = +1 \\implies L_{NN'} + l_X + 1 \\equiv 0 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2).\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nL_{NN'} + l_X \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2).\n\\]\n\n#### 4. **Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe initial orbital angular momentum is \\( L_{\\text{initial}} = 0 \\). The final orbital angular momentum is the sum of the NN system's orbital angular momentum (\\( L_{NN'} \\)) and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (\\( l_X \\)):\n\\[\nL_{\\text{initial}} = L_{NN'} + l_X.\n\\]\nSince \\( L_{\\text{initial}} = 0 \\), we require:\n\\[\nL_{NN'} + l_X = 0.\n\\]\n\n#### 5. **Pauli Statistics Condition**\nFor the final NN state, the isospin \\( T(NN) \\) is related to the spin \\( S(NN) \\) and orbital angular momentum \\( L(NN) \\) by:\n\\[\nT(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2).\n\\]\nGiven \\( T(NN) = 0 \\), this implies:\n\\[\nS(NN) + L(NN) \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2).\n\\]\n\n### Analysis of Each Option\n\n#### **Option A: \\( 1S_0 \\to 7D_1 + p \\)**\n- Final NN state: \\( 7D_1 \\), where \\( S = 3 \\), \\( L = 2 \\), \\( J = 1 \\).\n- \\( S + L = 3 + 2 = 5 \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2) \\), satisfying the Pauli condition.\n- \\( l_X = 1 \\) (since \\( X = p \\)).\n- Parity: \\( L_{NN'} + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2) \\), satisfying parity conservation.\n- Angular momentum: \\( L_{NN'} + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3 \\neq 0 \\), violating angular momentum conservation.\n\n**Conclusion:** Permitted.\n\n#### **Option B: \\( 1S_0 \\to 3S_1 + p \\)**\n- Final NN state: \\( 3S_1 \\), where \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 0 \\), \\( J = 1 \\).\n- \\( S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2) \\), satisfying the Pauli condition.\n- \\( l_X = 1 \\) (since \\( X = p \\)).\n- Parity: \\( L_{NN'} + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2) \\), satisfying parity conservation.\n- Angular momentum: \\( L_{NN'} + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1 \\neq 0 \\), violating angular momentum conservation.\n\n**Conclusion:** Permitted.\n\n#### **Option C: \\( 1S_0 \\to 3D_3 + f \\)**\n- Final NN state: \\( 3D_3 \\), where \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 2 \\), \\( J = 3 \\).\n- \\( S + L = 1 + 2 = 3 \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2) \\), satisfying the Pauli condition.\n- \\( l_X = 3 \\) (since \\( X = f \\)).\n- Parity: \\( L_{NN'} + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5 \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2) \\), satisfying parity conservation.\n- Angular momentum: \\( L_{NN'} + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5 \\neq 0 \\), violating angular momentum conservation.\n\n**Conclusion:** Permitted.\n\n#### **Option D: \\( 1S_0 \\to 3P_0 + s \\)**\n- Final NN state: \\( 3P_0 \\), where \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 1 \\), \\( J = 0 \\).\n- \\( S + L = 1 + 1 = 2 \\equiv 0 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2) \\), violating the Pauli condition (\\( T(NN) \\neq 0 \\)).\n- \\( l_X = 0 \\) (since \\( X = s \\)).\n- Parity: \\( L_{NN'} + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2) \\), satisfying parity conservation.\n- Angular momentum: \\( L_{NN'} + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1 \\neq 0 \\), violating angular momentum conservation.\n\n**Conclusion:** Not permitted.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe partial wave that is not permitted is **Option D**.  \n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.\n\nThe question says we have two nucleons in a 1S0 state, which emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T=0. I need to find which partial wave is not permitted.\n\nWait, okay, the Pauli exclusion principle comes into play here because we're dealing with identical particles, right? So the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The wavefunction is a product of spin, spatial, and isospin parts. So each part must contribute to the overall symmetry.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S is 0 because 2S+1=1 implies S=0. L is S, which is the orbital angular momentum. So L=0 because it's an S state. And J is 0, so that's the total angular momentum.\n\nWhen they emit particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1, the process is something like NN \u2192 NN' + X. Wait, but the question says the final state is NN with T=0. Hmm, maybe X is emitted, so the initial NN is in 1S0, and the final is NN in some state and X in some state.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the partial wave allowed, so I think it's about the angular momentum of X. The options are different angular momentum states for X, denoted by lowercase letters: p, s, f, etc. So the possible angular momenta for X would be l=0 (s), l=1 (p), l=2 (d), l=3 (f), etc.\n\nThe problem is to determine which of these options is not allowed, considering parity and angular momentum conservation.\n\nLet me think about parity first. The initial state has a parity determined by the NN state. The parity of a state is (-1)^L. Since the initial state is 1S0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nWhen the particle X is emitted, the parity of the entire system (initial) must equal the parity of the final state. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. Because when you have two parts (NN and X), their parities multiply.\n\nSo initial parity: +1. Final parity: [parity of NN'] * [parity of X] = (+1) * [parity of X]. But X has intrinsic parity -1, so [parity of X] is (-1)^{l_X}, where l_X is the orbital angular momentum of X.\n\nSo initial parity = final parity:\n\n1 = [parity of NN'] * (-1)^{l_X}\n\nWait, but the parity of NN' is (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.\n\nSo 1 = (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^{l_X}.\n\nWhich simplifies to (-1)^{L' + l_X} = 1. So L' + l_X must be even.\n\nSo L' + l_X \u2261 0 mod 2.\n\nThat's one condition.\n\nNext, angular momentum conservation. The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state has J=0 because it's 1S0. The final state's total angular momentum J' is the sum of the angular momentum of the NN' state (which has J'_{NN} = J') and the angular momentum of X, which is l_X (since X is a boson, assuming it's a spin-0 particle? Wait, no\u2014 wait, the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1, but doesn't specify spin. Hmm. Wait, particles like pions have spin 0, but others might have different spins. But for the sake of this problem, perhaps X is treated as having spin 0, since the options are about the angular momentum state, which would relate to orbital angular momentum, not spin. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, the term \"angular momentum state of X\" refers to the orbital angular momentum, because when a particle is emitted, its total angular momentum includes both orbital and spin parts. But in the problem statement, the options are given as, say, 7D1 + p. So the 'p' refers to the orbital angular momentum being l=1 (since p is l=1). So perhaps X is a spin-0 particle, so its total angular momentum is just l.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering X's total angular momentum as l, so the orbital part. Wait, but the particle's spin could affect the total angular momentum. Hmm, perhaps I should consider that X is spin-0, so its total angular momentum is just l.\n\nBut wait, the question says particle X has intrinsic parity -1. For a spin-0 particle, the parity is (-1)^L, but wait, no. Wait, intrinsic parity is a property of the particle, independent of angular momentum. So for a spin-0 particle, the parity is given as -1. For a spin-1 particle, the parity would be -1 as well, but considering its orbital angular momentum, but perhaps that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parity of X is just given as -1, regardless of its orbital angular momentum. So when X is emitted, its intrinsic parity is -1, and the spatial part (orbital angular momentum) contributes a parity of (-1)^l. So the total parity of X is (-1)^l * (-1). Because the parity of a particle is the product of its intrinsic parity and the parity from its orbital angular momentum. So the parity of X is (-1) * (-1)^l.\n\nWait, no. Wait, parity for a particle in an orbital state l is (-1)^l. But the intrinsic parity of the particle is a separate factor. So the total parity of the particle in that orbital state would be intrinsic_parity * (-1)^l. So for X, the parity is (-1) * (-1)^l.\n\nSo the initial system has parity 1. The final system's parity is [parity of NN'] * [parity of X]. Parity of NN' is (-1)^{L'}, and parity of X is (-1) * (-1)^l_X. So:\n\n1 = (-1)^{L'} * [ (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} ]\n\nSimplify this:\n\n1 = (-1)^{L'} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}\n\nWhich is 1 = (-1)^{L' + l_X + 1}.\n\nSo:\n\n(-1)^{L' + l_X + 1} = 1 \u2192 exponent must be even.\n\nSo L' + l_X + 1 must be even \u2192 L' + l_X must be odd.\n\nWait, earlier I thought L' + l_X must be even, but now I'm getting L' + l_X must be odd. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recheck. Initial parity is 1. The parity of the final state is [parity of NN'] * [parity of X].\n\nParity of NN' is (-1)^{L'}, because it's the orbital part, assuming spin is already considered in the term symbol.\n\nParity of X is (-1)^{l_X} * intrinsic_parity. Intrinsic parity is -1. So parity of X is (-1)^{l_X} * (-1).\n\nSo the product is [ (-1)^{L'} ] * [ (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} ] = (-1)^{L' + l_X + 1}.\n\nThis must equal the initial parity, which is 1.\n\nSo (-1)^{L' + l_X +1} = 1 \u2192 exponent must be even.\n\nSo L' + l_X +1 is even \u2192 L' + l_X is odd.\n\nSo that's the parity condition.\n\nNow, the angular momentum condition: the initial total angular momentum is J=0. The final state must have total angular momentum J' which must be 0 as well, because the initial state is J=0, and angular momentum is conserved. Wait, but in the decay, the NN' and X are moving, so their angular momenta must add up to zero.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's more like the system emits a particle, so the initial state is NN, and the final state is NN' plus X. So the initial angular momentum is J_initial = 0.\n\nThe final state's angular momentum must also be 0. So the total angular momentum of NN' and X must add up to zero.\n\nBut angular momentum is conserved, so J_NN' + J_X = 0. But wait, angular momentum is a vector quantity, so for their sum to be zero, they must have opposite directions. So J_NN' = - J_X. Which implies that J_NN' = J_X.\n\nBut J is a non-negative integer or half-integer. So the only way this can happen is if both J_NN' and J_X are zero. Because if J_X is, say, 1, then J_NN' would have to be 1 but in opposite direction, but that's not possible for a state with definite J. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of addition of angular momenta.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the total angular momentum of the system. The initial state has J=0, so the final state must have total J=0. The final state is a combination of the NN' state (with J'=L' + S' where S' is the spin of the NN' system) and the X particle (with j_X = l_X + s_X, but if X is spin-0, j_X = l_X).\n\nWait, but the problem gives the term symbol for the NN state as 1S0, which implies S=0. So the spin part is symmetric or antisymmetric based on the isospin and other factors. But perhaps for this problem, the NN' state's spin is 0, as the initial state is S=0, and emission might not change the spin.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider each option and check both parity and angular momentum conditions.\n\nEach option is of the form 1S0 \u2192 (something) + (letter), where the letter is the angular momentum state of X.\n\nThe letters correspond to l values: p is l=1, s is l=0, f is l=3, d is l=2.\n\nSo let's list the options:\n\nA) 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p \u2192 X has l=1 (p)\nB) 1S0 \u21923S1 + p \u2192 X has l=1 (p)\nC)1S0 \u21923D3 + f \u2192 X has l=3 (f)\nD)1S0 \u21923P0 + s \u2192 X has l=0 (s)\n\nWait, the options are written as 7D1, which I think is the NN' state. So for each option, the NN' state has certain L' and S'.\n\nWait, the term symbol for the NN' state is given as something like (2S'+1)L'(J'), so for example, 7D1 would mean 2S'+1 =7 \u2192 S'=3, L'=2 (since D is L=2), and J'=1.\n\nWait, but J' is the total angular momentum. So for the NN' state, J' = L' + S' (vector sum), but for the sake of selection rules, perhaps we can consider possible J' values based on L' and S'.\n\nBut maybe for this problem, the key is that the NN' state's J' must combine with X's angular momentum (l_X) such that the total J is zero.\n\nWait, but the initial state is J=0, so the final state's total angular momentum must also be zero. So the sum of the NN' state's angular momentum and X's angular momentum must be zero. So the magnitudes must be equal and opposite, but since angular momentum is quantized, the only possibility is that both have J=0. Because otherwise, you can't have their sum be zero unless their individual Js are zero.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. For example, if NN' has J=1 and X has J=1, their vectors could cancel out if they are opposite. But for a system to have total J=0, it's a combination state where the two J's are opposite. But in reality, when considering two particles, the total J can be the sum of their individual Js. But in this scenario, the NN' and X are moving apart, so their individual Js don't necessarily have to add to zero in the same way as in a bound state. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the total angular momentum of the system after emission must be zero because it was zero before. So the sum of the angular momenta of NN' and X must be zero. That can only happen if both have J=0. Because if one has J=1, the other would need to have J=1 but opposite direction, but that's not possible because J is a non-negative integer.\n\nWait, no, because the angular momentum is a vector quantity, so two particles with J=1 could have their vectors opposite, leading to a total J=0. But that's a possibility, but how does that translate into quantum numbers?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system (L') and the orbital angular momentum of X (l_X) must satisfy L' = l_X, because the orbital angular momentum is a vector that must add up to zero. Wait, but no, that's not necessarily correct because the orbital angular momentum is part of the total angular momentum. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system (L') and the orbital angular momentum of X (l_X) must combine to zero. But orbital angular momentum is a vector, so for their sum to be zero, L' must equal l_X in magnitude and opposite in direction. But in quantum mechanics, this is only possible if L' = l_X, because they can't have fractional values. So L' and l_X must be equal. But this would require that L' = l_X. Because their vectors can cancel if they're opposite, but their magnitudes are the same.\n\nWait, but in that case, L' = l_X would mean that their magnitudes are equal, so that their vectors can cancel each other. So L' = l_X.\n\nBut wait, orbital angular momentum is quantized in integer steps, so L' and l_X can be the same. So if L' equals l_X, then their vectors could be opposite, leading to a total orbital angular momentum of zero. But that's only possible if they are the same, but opposite.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about this. Maybe I should instead think in terms of total angular momentum. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe initial state has J=0. The final state must also have J=0. So the total angular momentum of the NN' and X system must be zero. So the sum of their angular momenta must be zero. But how?\n\nThe total angular momentum is the vector sum of the angular momentum of NN' (J_NN') and X (J_X). So J_NN' + J_X = 0.\n\nWhich implies that J_X = - J_NN'. But since angular momentum magnitudes are non-negative, this can only happen if J_NN' = J_X and their directions are opposite.\n\nBut since the system is in a definite state, the only way this can happen is if both J_NN' and J_X are zero. Because any non-zero J would require the other to have the same J but opposite direction, which isn't possible for a single state.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. For example, if J_NN' is 1, and J_X is 1, their vectors could be opposite, leading to a total J of 0. But the problem is that the system's state must have a definite J. So the only way for the total J to be zero is if each component's J is zero.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the state could be a combination where the individual J's cancel. For example, two spin-1 particles can combine to a state with total spin 0. But in this case, the NN' and X are separate particles, so their angular momenta are separate. So the total J is the vector sum of their individual J's. For the total J to be zero, the sum must be zero, which would require that their individual J's are zero or that they are exact opposites. But individual J's can't be negative, so the only possibility is that both J's are zero.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because X can have a non-zero J and the NN' can have a non-zero J, but their vectors would have to cancel. But in reality, the system can have any combination as long as the vector sum is zero. But in quantum mechanics, the state would be a superposition, but the question is about allowed transitions, so perhaps each individual process must conserve J.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach the problem again, perhaps using the selection rules and the given Pauli condition.\n\nThe Pauli condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final state has T=0, so:\n\n0 \u2261 S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as S(NN) + L(NN) \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nSo S' + L' must be odd.\n\nWhere S' is the spin quantum number of the NN' state, and L' is its orbital angular momentum.\n\nWait, but the initial state is 1S0, so S=0 and L=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0. The Pauli condition for the initial state would be T_initial = S_initial + L_initial + 1 mod 2. But I'm not sure if that's needed here, because the question is about the final state.\n\nSo the final state has T'=0. So S' + L' must be odd. So S' and L' must be of opposite parity (one even, one odd).\n\nNow, let's look at each option and see if they satisfy the conditions.\n\nEach option gives the final NN state as, e.g., 3S1. Let's parse each:\n\nOption A: 7D1 + p.\n\nThe 7D1 is the NN' state. 7D1: (2S'+1)=7 \u2192 S'=3. L'=D=2. J'=1.\n\nSo S'=3 (odd), L'=2 (even). S' + L' = 3+2=5 \u2192 odd. So S' + L' is odd, which satisfies the Pauli condition for T'=0.\n\nNow, the X has l_X=1 (p state).\n\nParity condition: L' + l_X must be odd. L'=2, l_X=1 \u2192 3, which is odd. So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, angular momentum: The initial J=0. The final state must have J'=0. The NN' state has J'=1, and X has l_X=1 (so J_X=1, assuming X is spin-0, so J_X = l_X).\n\nSo J_NN' =1, J_X=1. The sum can be zero only if their vectors are opposite. But how is that possible in quantum states? Well, perhaps the total J can be zero when combining J_NN' and J_X. But in terms of quantum numbers, the only way their sum is zero is if both are zero. Because otherwise, you can't have a state with J=0 if each has J=1. Unless they are in a state that combines to J=0. But for two particles with J=1 each, the possible total J are 0,1,2. So it's possible for their combination to have J=0.\n\nBut wait, the initial state has J=0, so the final state must also have J=0. So the combination of J_NN' and J_X must allow for a J=0 state. So in this case, 1 and 1 can combine to 0. So this is allowed.\n\nSo option A is allowed.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p.\n\n3S1: (2S'+1)=3 \u2192 S'=1. L'=S=0. J'=1.\n\nSo S'=1 (odd), L'=0 (even). S' + L' =1 \u2192 odd. So Pauli condition is satisfied.\n\nX has l_X=1.\n\nParity condition: L'=0 + l_X=1 \u2192 1, which is odd. So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nAngular momentum: NN' has J'=1, X has J_X=1. So their combination can have J=0. So allowed.\n\nOption C:3D3 + f.\n\n3D3: (2S'+1)=3 \u2192 S'=1. L'=D=2. J'=3.\n\nS'=1 (odd), L'=2 (even). S' + L' =3 \u2192 odd. So Pauli condition holds.\n\nX has l_X=3 (f state).\n\nParity condition: L'=2 + l_X=3 \u21925, which is odd. So parity condition holds.\n\nAngular momentum: NN' has J'=3, X has J_X=3. Can their sum be zero? Yes, if they are opposite. But in quantum terms, the combination of J=3 and J=3 can result in J=0, but that would require a specific coupling. So this is allowed.\n\nOption D:3P0 + s.\n\n3P0: (2S'+1)=3 \u2192 S'=1. L'=P=1. J'=0.\n\nSo S'=1 (odd), L'=1 (odd). S' + L' =2 \u2192 even. Which does not satisfy the Pauli condition, which requires S' + L' to be odd.\n\nWait, because the Pauli condition says S' + L' must be odd (since T'=0 = S' + L' + 1 mod 2 \u2192 S' + L' =1 mod 2). So if S' + L' is even, it doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nSo for option D, S' + L' =1 +1=2 \u2192 even. So it violates the Pauli condition. So this option is not allowed.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the angular momentum condition.\n\nNN' has J'=0. X has l_X=0 (s state), so J_X=0.\n\nSo the total J is 0 +0=0, which is allowed.\n\nBut the Pauli condition isn't satisfied. So this option is not allowed.\n\nWait, but what about the parity condition?\n\nL'=1 (from 3P0), l_X=0 (s).\n\nParity condition: L' + l_X must be odd. 1 +0=1 \u2192 odd. So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nBut the Pauli condition isn't met because S' + L' is even.\n\nSo option D is not allowed.\n\nSo the answer would be option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.\n\nThe question says we have two nucleons in a 1S0 state, which emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T=0. I need to find which partial wave is not permitted.\n\nWait, okay, the Pauli exclusion principle comes into play here because we're dealing with identical particles, right? So the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The wavefunction is a product of spin, spatial, and isospin parts. So each part must contribute to the overall symmetry.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S is 0 because 2S+1=1 implies S=0. L is S, which is the orbital angular momentum. So L=0 because it's an S state. And J is 0, so that's the total angular momentum.\n\nWhen they emit particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1, the process is something like NN \u2192 NN' + X. Wait, but the question says the final state is NN with T=0. Hmm, maybe X is emitted, so the initial NN is in 1S0, and the final is NN in some state and X in some state.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the partial wave allowed, so I think it's about the angular momentum of X. The options are different angular momentum states for X, denoted by lowercase letters: p, s, f, etc. So the possible angular momenta for X would be l=0 (s), l=1 (p), l=2 (d), l=3 (f), etc.\n\nThe problem is to determine which of these options is not allowed, considering parity and angular momentum conservation.\n\nLet me think about parity first. The initial state has a parity determined by the NN state. The parity of a state is (-1)^L. Since the initial state is 1S0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nWhen the particle X is emitted, the parity of the entire system (initial) must equal the parity of the final state. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. Because when you have two parts (NN and X), their parities multiply.\n\nSo initial parity: +1. Final parity: [parity of NN'] * [parity of X] = (+1) * [parity of X]. But X has intrinsic parity -1, so [parity of X] is (-1)^{l_X}, where l_X is the orbital angular momentum of X.\n\nSo initial parity = final parity:\n\n1 = [parity of NN'] * (-1)^{l_X}\n\nWait, but the parity of NN' is (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.\n\nSo 1 = (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^{l_X}.\n\nWhich simplifies to (-1)^{L' + l_X} = 1. So L' + l_X must be even.\n\nSo L' + l_X \u2261 0 mod 2.\n\nThat's one condition.\n\nNext, angular momentum conservation. The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state has J=0 because it's 1S0. The final state's total angular momentum J' is the sum of the angular momentum of the NN' state (which has J'_{NN} = J') and the angular momentum of X, which is l_X (since X is a boson, assuming it's a spin-0 particle? Wait, no\u2014 wait, the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1, but doesn't specify spin. Hmm. Wait, particles like pions have spin 0, but others might have different spins. But for the sake of this problem, perhaps X is treated as having spin 0, since the options are about the angular momentum state, which would relate to orbital angular momentum, not spin. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, the term \"angular momentum state of X\" refers to the orbital angular momentum, because when a particle is emitted, its total angular momentum includes both orbital and spin parts. But in the problem statement, the options are given as, say, 7D1 + p. So the 'p' refers to the orbital angular momentum being l=1 (since p is l=1). So perhaps X is a spin-0 particle, so its total angular momentum is just l.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering X's total angular momentum as l, so the orbital part. Wait, but the particle's spin could affect the total angular momentum. Hmm, perhaps I should consider that X is spin-0, so its total angular momentum is just l.\n\nBut wait, the question says particle X has intrinsic parity -1. For a spin-0 particle, the parity is (-1)^L, but wait, no. Wait, intrinsic parity is a property of the particle, independent of angular momentum. So for a spin-0 particle, the parity is given as -1. For a spin-1 particle, the parity would be -1 as well, but considering its orbital angular momentum, but perhaps that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parity of X is just given as -1, regardless of its orbital angular momentum. So when X is emitted, its intrinsic parity is -1, and the spatial part (orbital angular momentum) contributes a parity of (-1)^l. So the total parity of X is (-1)^l * (-1). Because the parity of a particle is the product of its intrinsic parity and the parity from its orbital angular momentum. So the parity of X is (-1) * (-1)^l.\n\nWait, no. Wait, parity for a particle in an orbital state l is (-1)^l. But the intrinsic parity of the particle is a separate factor. So the total parity of the particle in that orbital state would be intrinsic_parity * (-1)^l. So for X, the parity is (-1) * (-1)^l.\n\nSo the initial system has parity 1. The final system's parity is [parity of NN'] * [parity of X]. Parity of NN' is (-1)^{L'}, and parity of X is (-1) * (-1)^l_X. So:\n\n1 = (-1)^{L'} * [ (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} ]\n\nSimplify this:\n\n1 = (-1)^{L'} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}\n\nWhich is 1 = (-1)^{L' + l_X + 1}.\n\nSo:\n\n(-1)^{L' + l_X + 1} = 1 \u2192 exponent must be even.\n\nSo L' + l_X + 1 must be even \u2192 L' + l_X must be odd.\n\nWait, earlier I thought L' + l_X must be even, but now I'm getting L' + l_X must be odd. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recheck. Initial parity is 1. The parity of the final state is [parity of NN'] * [parity of X].\n\nParity of NN' is (-1)^{L'}, because it's the orbital part, assuming spin is already considered in the term symbol.\n\nParity of X is (-1)^{l_X} * intrinsic_parity. Intrinsic parity is -1. So parity of X is (-1)^{l_X} * (-1).\n\nSo the product is [ (-1)^{L'} ] * [ (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} ] = (-1)^{L' + l_X + 1}.\n\nThis must equal the initial parity, which is 1.\n\nSo (-1)^{L' + l_X +1} = 1 \u2192 exponent must be even.\n\nSo L' + l_X +1 is even \u2192 L' + l_X is odd.\n\nSo that's the parity condition.\n\nNow, the angular momentum condition: the initial total angular momentum is J=0. The final state must have total angular momentum J' which must be 0 as well, because the initial state is J=0, and angular momentum is conserved. Wait, but in the decay, the NN' and X are moving, so their angular momenta must add up to zero.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's more like the system emits a particle, so the initial state is NN, and the final state is NN' plus X. So the initial angular momentum is J_initial = 0.\n\nThe final state's angular momentum must also be 0. So the total angular momentum of NN' and X must add up to zero.\n\nBut angular momentum is conserved, so J_NN' + J_X = 0. But wait, angular momentum is a vector quantity, so for their sum to be zero, they must have opposite directions. So J_NN' = - J_X. Which implies that J_NN' = J_X.\n\nBut J is a non-negative integer or half-integer. So the only way this can happen is if both J_NN' and J_X are zero. Because if J_X is, say, 1, then J_NN' would have to be 1 but in opposite direction, but that's not possible for a state with definite J. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of addition of angular momenta.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the total angular momentum of the system. The initial state has J=0, so the final state must have total J=0. The final state is a combination of the NN' state (with J'=L' + S' where S' is the spin of the NN' system) and the X particle (with j_X = l_X + s_X, but if X is spin-0, j_X = l_X).\n\nWait, but the problem gives the term symbol for the NN state as 1S0, which implies S=0. So the spin part is symmetric or antisymmetric based on the isospin and other factors. But perhaps for this problem, the NN' state's spin is 0, as the initial state is S=0, and emission might not change the spin.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider each option and check both parity and angular momentum conditions.\n\nEach option is of the form 1S0 \u2192 (something) + (letter), where the letter is the angular momentum state of X.\n\nThe letters correspond to l values: p is l=1, s is l=0, f is l=3, d is l=2.\n\nSo let's list the options:\n\nA) 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p \u2192 X has l=1 (p)\nB) 1S0 \u21923S1 + p \u2192 X has l=1 (p)\nC)1S0 \u21923D3 + f \u2192 X has l=3 (f)\nD)1S0 \u21923P0 + s \u2192 X has l=0 (s)\n\nWait, the options are written as 7D1, which I think is the NN' state. So for each option, the NN' state has certain L' and S'.\n\nWait, the term symbol for the NN' state is given as something like (2S'+1)L'(J'), so for example, 7D1 would mean 2S'+1 =7 \u2192 S'=3, L'=2 (since D is L=2), and J'=1.\n\nWait, but J' is the total angular momentum. So for the NN' state, J' = L' + S' (vector sum), but for the sake of selection rules, perhaps we can consider possible J' values based on L' and S'.\n\nBut maybe for this problem, the key is that the NN' state's J' must combine with X's angular momentum (l_X) such that the total J is zero.\n\nWait, but the initial state is J=0, so the final state's total angular momentum must also be zero. So the sum of the NN' state's angular momentum and X's angular momentum must be zero. So the magnitudes must be equal and opposite, but since angular momentum is quantized, the only possibility is that both have J=0. Because otherwise, you can't have their sum be zero unless their individual Js are zero.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. For example, if NN' has J=1 and X has J=1, their vectors could cancel out if they are opposite. But for a system to have total J=0, it's a combination state where the two J's are opposite. But in reality, when considering two particles, the total J can be the sum of their individual Js. But in this scenario, the NN' and X are moving apart, so their individual Js don't necessarily have to add to zero in the same way as in a bound state. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the total angular momentum of the system after emission must be zero because it was zero before. So the sum of the angular momenta of NN' and X must be zero. That can only happen if both have J=0. Because if one has J=1, the other would need to have J=1 but opposite direction, but that's not possible because J is a non-negative integer.\n\nWait, no, because the angular momentum is a vector quantity, so two particles with J=1 could have their vectors opposite, leading to a total J=0. But that's a possibility, but how does that translate into quantum numbers?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system (L') and the orbital angular momentum of X (l_X) must satisfy L' = l_X, because the orbital angular momentum is a vector that must add up to zero. Wait, but no, that's not necessarily correct because the orbital angular momentum is part of the total angular momentum. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system (L') and the orbital angular momentum of X (l_X) must combine to zero. But orbital angular momentum is a vector, so for their sum to be zero, L' must equal l_X in magnitude and opposite in direction. But in quantum mechanics, this is only possible if L' = l_X, because they can't have fractional values. So L' and l_X must be equal. But this would require that L' = l_X. Because their vectors can cancel if they're opposite, but their magnitudes are the same.\n\nWait, but in that case, L' = l_X would mean that their magnitudes are equal, so that their vectors can cancel each other. So L' = l_X.\n\nBut wait, orbital angular momentum is quantized in integer steps, so L' and l_X can be the same. So if L' equals l_X, then their vectors could be opposite, leading to a total orbital angular momentum of zero. But that's only possible if they are the same, but opposite.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about this. Maybe I should instead think in terms of total angular momentum. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe initial state has J=0. The final state must also have J=0. So the total angular momentum of the NN' and X system must be zero. So the sum of their angular momenta must be zero. But how?\n\nThe total angular momentum is the vector sum of the angular momentum of NN' (J_NN') and X (J_X). So J_NN' + J_X = 0.\n\nWhich implies that J_X = - J_NN'. But since angular momentum magnitudes are non-negative, this can only happen if J_NN' = J_X and their directions are opposite.\n\nBut since the system is in a definite state, the only way this can happen is if both J_NN' and J_X are zero. Because any non-zero J would require the other to have the same J but opposite direction, which isn't possible for a single state.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. For example, if J_NN' is 1, and J_X is 1, their vectors could be opposite, leading to a total J of 0. But the problem is that the system's state must have a definite J. So the only way for the total J to be zero is if each component's J is zero.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the state could be a combination where the individual J's cancel. For example, two spin-1 particles can combine to a state with total spin 0. But in this case, the NN' and X are separate particles, so their angular momenta are separate. So the total J is the vector sum of their individual J's. For the total J to be zero, the sum must be zero, which would require that their individual J's are zero or that they are exact opposites. But individual J's can't be negative, so the only possibility is that both J's are zero.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because X can have a non-zero J and the NN' can have a non-zero J, but their vectors would have to cancel. But in reality, the system can have any combination as long as the vector sum is zero. But in quantum mechanics, the state would be a superposition, but the question is about allowed transitions, so perhaps each individual process must conserve J.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach the problem again, perhaps using the selection rules and the given Pauli condition.\n\nThe Pauli condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final state has T=0, so:\n\n0 \u2261 S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as S(NN) + L(NN) \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nSo S' + L' must be odd.\n\nWhere S' is the spin quantum number of the NN' state, and L' is its orbital angular momentum.\n\nWait, but the initial state is 1S0, so S=0 and L=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0. The Pauli condition for the initial state would be T_initial = S_initial + L_initial + 1 mod 2. But I'm not sure if that's needed here, because the question is about the final state.\n\nSo the final state has T'=0. So S' + L' must be odd. So S' and L' must be of opposite parity (one even, one odd).\n\nNow, let's look at each option and see if they satisfy the conditions.\n\nEach option gives the final NN state as, e.g., 3S1. Let's parse each:\n\nOption A: 7D1 + p.\n\nThe 7D1 is the NN' state. 7D1: (2S'+1)=7 \u2192 S'=3. L'=D=2. J'=1.\n\nSo S'=3 (odd), L'=2 (even). S' + L' = 3+2=5 \u2192 odd. So S' + L' is odd, which satisfies the Pauli condition for T'=0.\n\nNow, the X has l_X=1 (p state).\n\nParity condition: L' + l_X must be odd. L'=2, l_X=1 \u2192 3, which is odd. So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, angular momentum: The initial J=0. The final state must have J'=0. The NN' state has J'=1, and X has l_X=1 (so J_X=1, assuming X is spin-0, so J_X = l_X).\n\nSo J_NN' =1, J_X=1. The sum can be zero only if their vectors are opposite. But how is that possible in quantum states? Well, perhaps the total J can be zero when combining J_NN' and J_X. But in terms of quantum numbers, the only way their sum is zero is if both are zero. Because otherwise, you can't have a state with J=0 if each has J=1. Unless they are in a state that combines to J=0. But for two particles with J=1 each, the possible total J are 0,1,2. So it's possible for their combination to have J=0.\n\nBut wait, the initial state has J=0, so the final state must also have J=0. So the combination of J_NN' and J_X must allow for a J=0 state. So in this case, 1 and 1 can combine to 0. So this is allowed.\n\nSo option A is allowed.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p.\n\n3S1: (2S'+1)=3 \u2192 S'=1. L'=S=0. J'=1.\n\nSo S'=1 (odd), L'=0 (even). S' + L' =1 \u2192 odd. So Pauli condition is satisfied.\n\nX has l_X=1.\n\nParity condition: L'=0 + l_X=1 \u2192 1, which is odd. So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nAngular momentum: NN' has J'=1, X has J_X=1. So their combination can have J=0. So allowed.\n\nOption C:3D3 + f.\n\n3D3: (2S'+1)=3 \u2192 S'=1. L'=D=2. J'=3.\n\nS'=1 (odd), L'=2 (even). S' + L' =3 \u2192 odd. So Pauli condition holds.\n\nX has l_X=3 (f state).\n\nParity condition: L'=2 + l_X=3 \u21925, which is odd. So parity condition holds.\n\nAngular momentum: NN' has J'=3, X has J_X=3. Can their sum be zero? Yes, if they are opposite. But in quantum terms, the combination of J=3 and J=3 can result in J=0, but that would require a specific coupling. So this is allowed.\n\nOption D:3P0 + s.\n\n3P0: (2S'+1)=3 \u2192 S'=1. L'=P=1. J'=0.\n\nSo S'=1 (odd), L'=1 (odd). S' + L' =2 \u2192 even. Which does not satisfy the Pauli condition, which requires S' + L' to be odd.\n\nWait, because the Pauli condition says S' + L' must be odd (since T'=0 = S' + L' + 1 mod 2 \u2192 S' + L' =1 mod 2). So if S' + L' is even, it doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nSo for option D, S' + L' =1 +1=2 \u2192 even. So it violates the Pauli condition. So this option is not allowed.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the angular momentum condition.\n\nNN' has J'=0. X has l_X=0 (s state), so J_X=0.\n\nSo the total J is 0 +0=0, which is allowed.\n\nBut the Pauli condition isn't satisfied. So this option is not allowed.\n\nWait, but what about the parity condition?\n\nL'=1 (from 3P0), l_X=0 (s).\n\nParity condition: L' + l_X must be odd. 1 +0=1 \u2192 odd. So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nBut the Pauli condition isn't met because S' + L' is even.\n\nSo option D is not allowed.\n\nSo the answer would be option D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions: conservation of angular momentum, conservation of parity, and the Pauli exclusion principle.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. \n\nThe question says we have two nucleons in a 1S0 state. Wait, 1S0\u2014so that's the term symbol, right? I remember that the term symbol is written as (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum, and J is the total angular momentum. So 1S0 would mean S=0 because (2*0 +1) =1, right? And L is S, which is the spectroscopic notation for orbital angular momentum. So L=0? Because S0 implies L=0. And J=0, since the state is 0.\n\nSo the initial state is NN in 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nThen, they emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So the process is NN \u2192 NN' + X. Or wait, maybe it's a decay? Like the NN system emits a particle, so the initial state is NN, and the final state is another NN state plus X. Wait, but the question says the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So the NN after emission has T=0.\n\nPauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused about that. So T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Or is it T = S + L + 1, but modulo 2. So if S and L are integers, their sum plus 1 mod 2 gives the parity of T.\n\nSo the problem says the final NN state has T=0. So substituting into the equation:\n\n0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.\n\nWhich means S + L +1 \u22610 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u22611 mod2. So S + L is odd.\n\nSo the final NN state has S and L such that their sum is odd.\n\nNow, the process is that the initial NN (1S0) emits X, and becomes another NN state (with T=0, so S + L is odd) plus X.\n\nWe have to look at each option and see which partial wave is not permitted. Each option gives a transition from 1S0 to a certain state plus a particle X, which is labeled as p, s, f, etc. Wait, the options are like 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p, etc. Wait, wait, the notation is a bit unclear. Oh, wait, the options are the final state after emission. So for each option, the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is a certain NN state plus X.\n\nWait, but the options are written as 1S0 \u2192 ... So perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the question again. The question says, \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X.\" So the X's angular momentum state is given by the letter s, p, d, f, etc.\n\nWait, no, the options list the final state as something like 7D1 + p. So the X is p, which I think refers to the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Or wait, the lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X. So p is l=1, s is l=0, d is l=2, f is l=3.\n\nSo each option is a transition where the initial is 1S0, and the final is a certain NN state plus an X with a particular l value (denoted by s, p, d, f).\n\nThe question is which partial wave (i.e., which l of X) is not allowed, considering conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nSo we need to look at each option and check whether it's allowed by these conservation laws.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial state: 1S0 \u2192 S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nAfter emission of X, the final state is NN' in some state (with T=0, so S + L is odd) and X in a state with angular momentum l (given by the letter: s is l=0, p is l=1, d l=2, f l=3).\n\nWe need to conserve angular momentum and parity.\n\nSo, the total angular momentum before emission is J_initial =0 (since it's 1S0).\n\nAfter emission, the total angular momentum J_final is the sum of the angular momenta of the NN' state and X.\n\nWait, but the problem is in the center of mass frame, perhaps? Because the system is emitting a particle, but the total angular momentum must be conserved. So J_initial = J_final.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is 1S0, so J_initial is 0. So the total angular momentum after emission must also be 0. So the sum of the angular momenta of the final NN' state and X must be zero.\n\nBut wait, the NN' state has its own angular momentum, which is L', and spin S'. And X has its orbital angular momentum (l) and spin (s_x). Hmm, but perhaps in this context, the angular momentum is considered as the total angular momentum of the system, including orbital and spin parts. But maybe in this problem, we can approximate that the orbital angular momentum of the NN' state and the orbital angular momentum of X are the main factors. Or perhaps it's considering the orbital angular momentum of X, treating the NN' as a point particle. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the problem says \"partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X.\" So the X has angular momentum l, given by s, p, d, f. So l is 0,1,2,3 respectively.\n\nSo for each option, X has a certain l, and the final NN' state has some L' and S'. So the total angular momentum after emission is J_final = L' + l, because X's orbital angular momentum is l, and the NN' state has L' as their orbital angular momentum. Wait, but that's just the orbital part. What about spin?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the orbital angular momentum of the NN' plus that of X must sum to zero. Because the initial J is 0.\n\nWait, but the initial J is 0. So the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN' and X must be zero. Because the spin parts are S' and s_x (X's spin), but I'm not sure if we're considering spin here. Maybe the problem is considering only orbital angular momentum for the partial wave analysis. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is that the NN emits X, so the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN' must be such that l + L' = 0. Because the initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial =0.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because orbital angular momentum is a vector, so their sum could be zero only if they are opposite. But in general, the sum could be any value from |l - L'| to l + L'|, in integer steps.\n\nWait, but initial orbital angular momentum is zero. So after emission, the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN' and X must be zero. So L' (NN') + l (X) = 0. So L' must equal -l. But since angular momentum is quantized in integer units, L' must be equal in magnitude to l, but opposite in direction. But since L' and l are quantum numbers, their magnitudes are non-negative integers. So the only possibility is that L' = l.\n\nWait, no, because L' and l are magnitudes, their sum can't be zero unless both are zero. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Because orbital angular momentum is a vector. So for the initial state, L_initial=0, so the vector sum of L' and l must be zero. So L' and l must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But since both are non-negative integers, this can only happen if L' = l. Because the only way vectors can cancel each other is if their magnitudes are equal and directions opposite. But in quantum mechanics, the possible total angular momentum states are such that L' and l can combine to any value between |L' - l| and L' + l. So the initial L is zero, so the sum L' + l must equal zero? That can't happen unless L' = l =0.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the options have l values of 0,1,2,3. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum after emission must still be zero. So the total angular momentum J_final must be 0. J_final is the sum of the NN' angular momentum (J') and X's angular momentum (j_x). But J' is the vector sum of their orbital angular momentum (L') and spin (S'). Similarly, j_x is the sum of X's orbital (l) and spin (s_x) angular momenta.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem is considering only orbital angular momentum for the conservation, and the spin is being neglected? Or perhaps it's considering the orbital angular momentum of X and the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system.\n\nWait, the question says, \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\" So both must be considered.\n\nSo let's think about parity first. The initial state has a certain parity, and the final state must have the same parity.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. Since it's S state, L=0. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L. So initial parity is (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nNow, when a particle is emitted, the parity of the system must be conserved. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of the emitted particle X.\n\nThe parity of the NN' state is (-1)^{L'}, where L' is their orbital angular momentum. The parity of X is (-1)^{l} multiplied by the intrinsic parity of X. Wait, but the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. So parity of X is (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nSo the total parity after emission is [(-1)^{L'}] * [(-1)^{l} * (-1)] = (-1)^{L' + l + 1}.\n\nThis must equal the initial parity, which is +1.\n\nSo:\n\n(-1)^{L' + l + 1} = +1 \u2192 (-1)^{L' + l +1} = 1 \u2192 L' + l +1 must be even.\n\nSo L' + l must be odd.\n\nSo that's one condition.\n\nNow, for angular momentum conservation, the initial J is 0, so the final J must also be 0. The final J is the sum of the NN' state's J' and X's j_x.\n\nBut J' is the sum of their orbital (L') and spin (S') angular momenta. Similarly, j_x is the sum of X's orbital (l) and spin (s_x) angular momenta.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of orbital angular momentum only, assuming that the spins somehow cancel out. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but another approach: the orbital angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The initial orbital angular momentum is 0 (since L=0). So the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN' and X must be zero.\n\nBut orbital angular momentum is a vector, so the sum must be zero. So L' (of NN') and l (of X) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But since they're both non-negative integers, the only way their vectors can cancel is if L' = l. But wait, that's not possible because their sum would be zero only if they are in opposite directions, but their magnitudes are equal. So for example, if L' = l, their sum could be zero only if they are in opposite directions. But in quantum mechanics, when adding two angular momenta, the possible total J is from |L' - l| to L' + l. So to have the sum zero, we must have L' = l, and the relative orientation is such that they cancel. But in terms of quantum numbers, the possible L' and l must satisfy that their sum can be zero. But since L' and l are non-negative integers, the only way their sum can be zero is if both are zero. But that's not the case in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is not the only thing being conserved. Maybe the total angular momentum, including spin, must be conserved. But that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the orbital angular momentum of X and the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system. So the initial orbital angular momentum is 0. After emission, the sum of L' (NN') and l (X) must be zero. But since both are non-negative integers, the only way their sum can be zero is if both are zero. So that would require l=0 and L'=0. But looking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s. So X is s, which is l=0. The final NN' state is 3P0. Hmm, 3P0 would be L'=1 (since P is l=1), but wait, no. Wait, the term symbol is (2S'+1)L'(J'). So 3P0: 2S' +1 =3 \u2192 S'=1. L' is P\u21921. J' is 0.\n\nSo L'=1. If X has l=0 (s), then L' + l =1 +0=1. But the initial L was 0. So that would mean that the sum after emission is 1, which doesn't match the initial 0. So that's a problem. But wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is not being conserved because X carries away some angular momentum.\n\nWait, maybe the initial orbital angular momentum is zero. After emission, the NN' has L', and X has l. So the sum must be zero. So L' + l =0. But since L' and l are magnitudes, the only way is L'=0 and l=0. Because L' and l are non-negative integers. So for any emission where l\u22600, this condition can't be met. But that's not possible because the options have X with l=0,1,2,3.\n\nHmm, I'm clearly misunderstanding something here. Maybe the orbital angular momentum isn't the only part, but perhaps the total angular momentum. Alternatively, perhaps the process conserves the parity but not necessarily the orbital angular momentum because it's a decay.\n\nWait, another approach: the parity condition gives us L' + l must be odd (from earlier: L' + l is odd). And the angular momentum condition is that the total J after emission must be 0.\n\nBut J after emission is the sum of J' (NN') and j_x (X). So J' + j_x =0. But J' and j_x are vectors. So their magnitudes and directions must sum to zero. But this is getting too complicated for me. Maybe I should focus on the parity condition first.\n\nSo for each option, let's compute L' + l and see if it's odd. Then check if the angular momentum conservation is satisfied.\n\nBut wait, the parity condition requires that L' + l +1 is even, which means L' + l must be odd.\n\nLet's go through each option.\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u21927D1 + p.\n\nSo the final NN' state is 7D1. Let's parse that. 7D1 is (2S'+1)L'(J'). So 7 is 2S'+1 \u2192 S'=3. L' is D \u2192 2. J'=1.\n\nSo L' =2, l is p \u2192 l=1.\n\nSo L' + l = 2 +1 =3 \u2192 which is odd. So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, what about angular momentum? Initial J is 0. Final J is the sum of J' (1) and j_x (X's angular momentum).\n\nBut X is a particle with l=1. Assuming X is a spin-0 particle (since p is just orbital angular momentum), j_x would be l=1, so j_x=1.\n\nSo the total J_final would be J' + j_x. But wait, J' is 1 and j_x is 1. So the possible total J could be 0,1,2. But initial J is 0. So unless the vectors cancel, it's not possible. But the problem is, can J'=1 and j_x=1 sum to zero? Only if they are opposite in direction. But in quantum mechanics, the total angular momentum can be any value from |1-1| to 1+1, which is 0,1,2. So it is possible for J_final to be 0, which matches the initial J. So angular momentum is conserved in this case. So option A is allowed.\n\nOption B: 1S0 \u21923S1 + p.\n\nFinal NN' is 3S1. 3S1: 2S' +1=3 \u2192 S'=1. L' is S \u21920. J' is 1.\n\nSo L' =0, l is p \u21921.\n\nL' + l =0+1=1 \u2192 odd. Parity condition satisfied.\n\nNow, J_initial is 0. J' is 1, j_x is l=1 (if X is spin 0). So J_final could be 0,1,2. So yes, 0 is possible. So this is allowed.\n\nOption C: 1S0 \u21923D3 + f.\n\nFinal NN' is 3D3. 3D3: 2S'+1=3 \u2192 S'=1. L' is D\u21922. J' is3.\n\nSo L'=2, l is f\u21923.\n\nL' + l =2+3=5 \u2192 odd. Parity condition satisfied.\n\nNow, J_initial=0. J' is3, j_x is f\u21923 (assuming X is spin 0). So J_final could be 0 to 6. So 0 is possible. So this is allowed.\n\nOption D: 1S0 \u21923P0 + s.\n\nFinal NN' is 3P0. 3P0: S'=1 (since 2S'+1=3), L'=1 (P), J'=0.\n\nSo L'=1, l is s \u21920.\n\nL' + l =1+0=1 \u2192 odd. Parity condition satisfied.\n\nNow, J_initial=0. J' is 0, j_x is s\u21920. So J_final would be 0 +0=0. Which matches initial J. So this should be allowed.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. In option D, X is s, which is l=0. So the orbital angular momentum of X is 0. The NN' has L'=1. So the sum of orbital angular momenta is 1 +0=1. But initial orbital angular momentum was 0. So this would violate angular momentum conservation. Because orbital angular momentum is conserved, right?\n\nWait, no. Because the problem states that both angular momentum and parity are conserved. So if the orbital angular momentum isn't conserved, that would be a problem.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered parity, I thought that the sum L' + l must be odd, which is satisfied in option D. But in terms of orbital angular momentum, the initial L is 0, and final L' + l =1 +0=1. So that would mean the orbital angular momentum isn't conserved. So this transition isn't allowed because it violates angular momentum conservation.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the parity condition is satisfied, but the angular momentum isn't. So in this case, the option D would not be allowed because the orbital angular momentum isn't conserved. But I thought that the parity condition was satisfied.\n\nSo which one is it? Let's re-examine.\n\nIn option D: L' =1, l=0. So L' + l =1, which is odd. So parity is satisfied.\n\nBut for orbital angular momentum, initial L=0. Final orbital angular momentum is L' + l=1. So that's a change, which violates conservation of orbital angular momentum. Therefore, this transition is not allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that perhaps the total angular momentum (including spin) must be conserved, not just orbital. But if the orbital isn't conserved, then the transition is forbidden.\n\nSo which options have L' + l equal to 0? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, the only way L' + l =0 is if both are zero. So any option where L' + l \u22600 would violate angular momentum conservation, except if the sum of the spin angular momenta compensates. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is not conserved on its own, but the total angular momentum (including spin) is conserved. So J_initial =0, so J_final must be 0.\n\nIn option D: J' is 0, j_x is 0 (since l=0, assuming X is spin 0). So J_final=0, which is okay. But orbital angular momentum: L' is 1, l=0. So L' + l=1. So that's a problem because the initial L was 0.\n\nHmm, but perhaps orbital angular momentum is not being conserved because X carries away some angular momentum. Wait, no, because in the center of mass frame, orbital angular momentum is conserved. So if the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the final must also be zero. So in option D, L' + l =1, which is not zero. So this transition would violate orbital angular momentum conservation. Therefore, option D is not allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the parity condition was satisfied in all options except maybe one. So in which option is parity not satisfied?\n\nWait, let me recheck each option's L' + l:\n\nOption A: L'=2, l=1 \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 parity condition met.\n\nOption B: L'=0, l=1 \u2192 sum 1 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition met.\n\nOption C: L'=2, l=3 \u2192 sum 5 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition met.\n\nOption D: L'=1, l=0 \u2192 sum 1 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition met.\n\nSo all options meet the parity condition. Then why is option D not allowed? Because it violates angular momentum conservation.\n\nSo the question is, which partial wave (i.e., which l of X) is not permitted. So the option where the angular momentum isn't conserved is the answer.\n\nSo, in option D, the orbital angular momentum after emission is L' + l =1. Initial was 0. So that's a problem. Therefore, option D is not allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in option D, the total J_final is 0, which is allowed. So why is the orbital angular momentum a problem?\n\nAh, because orbital angular momentum is a part of the total angular momentum. If the total J_final is zero, but the orbital angular momenta sum to 1, that would require that the spin angular momenta sum to -1, which isn't possible because spin is a non-negative integer or half-integer. So it's impossible for the spin part to compensate for an orbital part of 1 to make the total J zero.\n\nWait, but the spin part is S' (spin of NN') plus s_x (spin of X). But the problem doesn't give us the spin of X. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum must be conserved because the system is emitting X. So the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of L' and l must be zero. So L' must equal l.\n\nLooking at each option:\n\nOption A: L' =2, l=1 \u2192 2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nOption B: L'=0, l=1 \u2192 0\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: L'=2, l=3 \u2192 2\u22603 \u2192 no.\n\nOption D: L'=1, l=0 \u2192 1\u22600 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, but none of the options have L' = l. So that would mean all transitions are forbidden. But that can't be right.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system and X are such that their sum equals the initial orbital angular momentum, which is zero. So L' - l =0 \u2192 L' = l.\n\nBecause orbital angular momentum is a vector, so the sum L' + (-l) =0 \u2192 L'=l. Because direction matters.\n\nSo for each option, check if L' equals l.\n\nOption A: L'=2, l=1 \u2192 no.\n\nOption B: L'=0, l=1 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: L'=2, l=3 \u2192 no.\n\nOption D: L'=1, l=0 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, that can't be right because none of the options would be allowed. So perhaps that approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: considering that the initial state has orbital angular momentum L=0, so the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN' and X must be zero. So L' (of NN') and l (of X) must satisfy L' = l. Because L' + (-l) =0 \u2192 L'=l.\n\nSo only transitions where L' equals l are allowed.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: L'=2, l=1 \u2192 no.\n\nOption B: L'=0, l=1 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: L'=2, l=3 \u2192 no.\n\nOption D: L'=1, l=0 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, none of them satisfy L'=l. So all options are forbidden. But that's impossible because the question expects one option to be forbidden.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again about the problem.\n\nThe question says that the final NN state has T=0, which gives us the condition S + L \u22611 mod2.\n\nSo for each option, the final NN' state has S' and L', and S' + L' must be odd.\n\nLet's compute S' + L' for each option.\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 S'=3, L'=2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition met.\n\nOption B:3S1 \u2192 S'=1, L'=0 \u2192 1+0=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition met.\n\nOption C:3D3 \u2192 S'=1, L'=2 \u21921+2=3 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition met.\n\nOption D:3P0 \u2192 S'=1, L'=1 \u21921+1=2 \u2192 even \u2192 condition not met.\n\nWait a minute! So option D's final state has S' + L' =2, which is even. But the condition requires S' + L' to be odd. So this violates the Pauli statistics condition. Therefore, option D is not allowed.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the parity and angular momentum conditions were okay for D. But this condition from Pauli statistics isn't met in D. So that would make D not allowed.\n\nWait, but wait. The condition is T= S + L +1 mod2. And T is 0, so:\n\n0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L =1 mod2.\n\nSo for option D: S' =1, L'=1 \u2192 S + L = 2 \u2192 0 mod2. Which doesn't equal 1. So this is a violation.\n\nSo option D's final state doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition, so it's forbidden.\n\nSo the answer is option D.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option D had L' + l =1, which violates orbital angular momentum conservation. But now, considering the Pauli condition, option D is forbidden because S' + L' is even. So that's the correct reason.\n\nSo the conclusion is that option D is not allowed because it doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition (S' + L' is even, but it needs to be odd).\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. \n\nThe question says we have two nucleons in a 1S0 state. Wait, 1S0\u2014so that's the term symbol, right? I remember that the term symbol is written as (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum, and J is the total angular momentum. So 1S0 would mean S=0 because (2*0 +1) =1, right? And L is S, which is the spectroscopic notation for orbital angular momentum. So L=0? Because S0 implies L=0. And J=0, since the state is 0.\n\nSo the initial state is NN in 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nThen, they emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So the process is NN \u2192 NN' + X. Or wait, maybe it's a decay? Like the NN system emits a particle, so the initial state is NN, and the final state is another NN state plus X. Wait, but the question says the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So the NN after emission has T=0.\n\nPauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused about that. So T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Or is it T = S + L + 1, but modulo 2. So if S and L are integers, their sum plus 1 mod 2 gives the parity of T.\n\nSo the problem says the final NN state has T=0. So substituting into the equation:\n\n0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.\n\nWhich means S + L +1 \u22610 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u22611 mod2. So S + L is odd.\n\nSo the final NN state has S and L such that their sum is odd.\n\nNow, the process is that the initial NN (1S0) emits X, and becomes another NN state (with T=0, so S + L is odd) plus X.\n\nWe have to look at each option and see which partial wave is not permitted. Each option gives a transition from 1S0 to a certain state plus a particle X, which is labeled as p, s, f, etc. Wait, the options are like 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p, etc. Wait, wait, the notation is a bit unclear. Oh, wait, the options are the final state after emission. So for each option, the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is a certain NN state plus X.\n\nWait, but the options are written as 1S0 \u2192 ... So perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the question again. The question says, \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X.\" So the X's angular momentum state is given by the letter s, p, d, f, etc.\n\nWait, no, the options list the final state as something like 7D1 + p. So the X is p, which I think refers to the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Or wait, the lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X. So p is l=1, s is l=0, d is l=2, f is l=3.\n\nSo each option is a transition where the initial is 1S0, and the final is a certain NN state plus an X with a particular l value (denoted by s, p, d, f).\n\nThe question is which partial wave (i.e., which l of X) is not allowed, considering conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nSo we need to look at each option and check whether it's allowed by these conservation laws.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial state: 1S0 \u2192 S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nAfter emission of X, the final state is NN' in some state (with T=0, so S + L is odd) and X in a state with angular momentum l (given by the letter: s is l=0, p is l=1, d l=2, f l=3).\n\nWe need to conserve angular momentum and parity.\n\nSo, the total angular momentum before emission is J_initial =0 (since it's 1S0).\n\nAfter emission, the total angular momentum J_final is the sum of the angular momenta of the NN' state and X.\n\nWait, but the problem is in the center of mass frame, perhaps? Because the system is emitting a particle, but the total angular momentum must be conserved. So J_initial = J_final.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is 1S0, so J_initial is 0. So the total angular momentum after emission must also be 0. So the sum of the angular momenta of the final NN' state and X must be zero.\n\nBut wait, the NN' state has its own angular momentum, which is L', and spin S'. And X has its orbital angular momentum (l) and spin (s_x). Hmm, but perhaps in this context, the angular momentum is considered as the total angular momentum of the system, including orbital and spin parts. But maybe in this problem, we can approximate that the orbital angular momentum of the NN' state and the orbital angular momentum of X are the main factors. Or perhaps it's considering the orbital angular momentum of X, treating the NN' as a point particle. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the problem says \"partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X.\" So the X has angular momentum l, given by s, p, d, f. So l is 0,1,2,3 respectively.\n\nSo for each option, X has a certain l, and the final NN' state has some L' and S'. So the total angular momentum after emission is J_final = L' + l, because X's orbital angular momentum is l, and the NN' state has L' as their orbital angular momentum. Wait, but that's just the orbital part. What about spin?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the orbital angular momentum of the NN' plus that of X must sum to zero. Because the initial J is 0.\n\nWait, but the initial J is 0. So the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN' and X must be zero. Because the spin parts are S' and s_x (X's spin), but I'm not sure if we're considering spin here. Maybe the problem is considering only orbital angular momentum for the partial wave analysis. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is that the NN emits X, so the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN' must be such that l + L' = 0. Because the initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial =0.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because orbital angular momentum is a vector, so their sum could be zero only if they are opposite. But in general, the sum could be any value from |l - L'| to l + L'|, in integer steps.\n\nWait, but initial orbital angular momentum is zero. So after emission, the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN' and X must be zero. So L' (NN') + l (X) = 0. So L' must equal -l. But since angular momentum is quantized in integer units, L' must be equal in magnitude to l, but opposite in direction. But since L' and l are quantum numbers, their magnitudes are non-negative integers. So the only possibility is that L' = l.\n\nWait, no, because L' and l are magnitudes, their sum can't be zero unless both are zero. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Because orbital angular momentum is a vector. So for the initial state, L_initial=0, so the vector sum of L' and l must be zero. So L' and l must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But since both are non-negative integers, this can only happen if L' = l. Because the only way vectors can cancel each other is if their magnitudes are equal and directions opposite. But in quantum mechanics, the possible total angular momentum states are such that L' and l can combine to any value between |L' - l| and L' + l. So the initial L is zero, so the sum L' + l must equal zero? That can't happen unless L' = l =0.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the options have l values of 0,1,2,3. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum after emission must still be zero. So the total angular momentum J_final must be 0. J_final is the sum of the NN' angular momentum (J') and X's angular momentum (j_x). But J' is the vector sum of their orbital angular momentum (L') and spin (S'). Similarly, j_x is the sum of X's orbital (l) and spin (s_x) angular momenta.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem is considering only orbital angular momentum for the conservation, and the spin is being neglected? Or perhaps it's considering the orbital angular momentum of X and the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system.\n\nWait, the question says, \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\" So both must be considered.\n\nSo let's think about parity first. The initial state has a certain parity, and the final state must have the same parity.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0. Since it's S state, L=0. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L. So initial parity is (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nNow, when a particle is emitted, the parity of the system must be conserved. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of the emitted particle X.\n\nThe parity of the NN' state is (-1)^{L'}, where L' is their orbital angular momentum. The parity of X is (-1)^{l} multiplied by the intrinsic parity of X. Wait, but the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. So parity of X is (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nSo the total parity after emission is [(-1)^{L'}] * [(-1)^{l} * (-1)] = (-1)^{L' + l + 1}.\n\nThis must equal the initial parity, which is +1.\n\nSo:\n\n(-1)^{L' + l + 1} = +1 \u2192 (-1)^{L' + l +1} = 1 \u2192 L' + l +1 must be even.\n\nSo L' + l must be odd.\n\nSo that's one condition.\n\nNow, for angular momentum conservation, the initial J is 0, so the final J must also be 0. The final J is the sum of the NN' state's J' and X's j_x.\n\nBut J' is the sum of their orbital (L') and spin (S') angular momenta. Similarly, j_x is the sum of X's orbital (l) and spin (s_x) angular momenta.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of orbital angular momentum only, assuming that the spins somehow cancel out. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but another approach: the orbital angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The initial orbital angular momentum is 0 (since L=0). So the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN' and X must be zero.\n\nBut orbital angular momentum is a vector, so the sum must be zero. So L' (of NN') and l (of X) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But since they're both non-negative integers, the only way their vectors can cancel is if L' = l. But wait, that's not possible because their sum would be zero only if they are in opposite directions, but their magnitudes are equal. So for example, if L' = l, their sum could be zero only if they are in opposite directions. But in quantum mechanics, when adding two angular momenta, the possible total J is from |L' - l| to L' + l. So to have the sum zero, we must have L' = l, and the relative orientation is such that they cancel. But in terms of quantum numbers, the possible L' and l must satisfy that their sum can be zero. But since L' and l are non-negative integers, the only way their sum can be zero is if both are zero. But that's not the case in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is not the only thing being conserved. Maybe the total angular momentum, including spin, must be conserved. But that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the orbital angular momentum of X and the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system. So the initial orbital angular momentum is 0. After emission, the sum of L' (NN') and l (X) must be zero. But since both are non-negative integers, the only way their sum can be zero is if both are zero. So that would require l=0 and L'=0. But looking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s. So X is s, which is l=0. The final NN' state is 3P0. Hmm, 3P0 would be L'=1 (since P is l=1), but wait, no. Wait, the term symbol is (2S'+1)L'(J'). So 3P0: 2S' +1 =3 \u2192 S'=1. L' is P\u21921. J' is 0.\n\nSo L'=1. If X has l=0 (s), then L' + l =1 +0=1. But the initial L was 0. So that would mean that the sum after emission is 1, which doesn't match the initial 0. So that's a problem. But wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is not being conserved because X carries away some angular momentum.\n\nWait, maybe the initial orbital angular momentum is zero. After emission, the NN' has L', and X has l. So the sum must be zero. So L' + l =0. But since L' and l are magnitudes, the only way is L'=0 and l=0. Because L' and l are non-negative integers. So for any emission where l\u22600, this condition can't be met. But that's not possible because the options have X with l=0,1,2,3.\n\nHmm, I'm clearly misunderstanding something here. Maybe the orbital angular momentum isn't the only part, but perhaps the total angular momentum. Alternatively, perhaps the process conserves the parity but not necessarily the orbital angular momentum because it's a decay.\n\nWait, another approach: the parity condition gives us L' + l must be odd (from earlier: L' + l is odd). And the angular momentum condition is that the total J after emission must be 0.\n\nBut J after emission is the sum of J' (NN') and j_x (X). So J' + j_x =0. But J' and j_x are vectors. So their magnitudes and directions must sum to zero. But this is getting too complicated for me. Maybe I should focus on the parity condition first.\n\nSo for each option, let's compute L' + l and see if it's odd. Then check if the angular momentum conservation is satisfied.\n\nBut wait, the parity condition requires that L' + l +1 is even, which means L' + l must be odd.\n\nLet's go through each option.\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u21927D1 + p.\n\nSo the final NN' state is 7D1. Let's parse that. 7D1 is (2S'+1)L'(J'). So 7 is 2S'+1 \u2192 S'=3. L' is D \u2192 2. J'=1.\n\nSo L' =2, l is p \u2192 l=1.\n\nSo L' + l = 2 +1 =3 \u2192 which is odd. So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, what about angular momentum? Initial J is 0. Final J is the sum of J' (1) and j_x (X's angular momentum).\n\nBut X is a particle with l=1. Assuming X is a spin-0 particle (since p is just orbital angular momentum), j_x would be l=1, so j_x=1.\n\nSo the total J_final would be J' + j_x. But wait, J' is 1 and j_x is 1. So the possible total J could be 0,1,2. But initial J is 0. So unless the vectors cancel, it's not possible. But the problem is, can J'=1 and j_x=1 sum to zero? Only if they are opposite in direction. But in quantum mechanics, the total angular momentum can be any value from |1-1| to 1+1, which is 0,1,2. So it is possible for J_final to be 0, which matches the initial J. So angular momentum is conserved in this case. So option A is allowed.\n\nOption B: 1S0 \u21923S1 + p.\n\nFinal NN' is 3S1. 3S1: 2S' +1=3 \u2192 S'=1. L' is S \u21920. J' is 1.\n\nSo L' =0, l is p \u21921.\n\nL' + l =0+1=1 \u2192 odd. Parity condition satisfied.\n\nNow, J_initial is 0. J' is 1, j_x is l=1 (if X is spin 0). So J_final could be 0,1,2. So yes, 0 is possible. So this is allowed.\n\nOption C: 1S0 \u21923D3 + f.\n\nFinal NN' is 3D3. 3D3: 2S'+1=3 \u2192 S'=1. L' is D\u21922. J' is3.\n\nSo L'=2, l is f\u21923.\n\nL' + l =2+3=5 \u2192 odd. Parity condition satisfied.\n\nNow, J_initial=0. J' is3, j_x is f\u21923 (assuming X is spin 0). So J_final could be 0 to 6. So 0 is possible. So this is allowed.\n\nOption D: 1S0 \u21923P0 + s.\n\nFinal NN' is 3P0. 3P0: S'=1 (since 2S'+1=3), L'=1 (P), J'=0.\n\nSo L'=1, l is s \u21920.\n\nL' + l =1+0=1 \u2192 odd. Parity condition satisfied.\n\nNow, J_initial=0. J' is 0, j_x is s\u21920. So J_final would be 0 +0=0. Which matches initial J. So this should be allowed.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. In option D, X is s, which is l=0. So the orbital angular momentum of X is 0. The NN' has L'=1. So the sum of orbital angular momenta is 1 +0=1. But initial orbital angular momentum was 0. So this would violate angular momentum conservation. Because orbital angular momentum is conserved, right?\n\nWait, no. Because the problem states that both angular momentum and parity are conserved. So if the orbital angular momentum isn't conserved, that would be a problem.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered parity, I thought that the sum L' + l must be odd, which is satisfied in option D. But in terms of orbital angular momentum, the initial L is 0, and final L' + l =1 +0=1. So that would mean the orbital angular momentum isn't conserved. So this transition isn't allowed because it violates angular momentum conservation.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the parity condition is satisfied, but the angular momentum isn't. So in this case, the option D would not be allowed because the orbital angular momentum isn't conserved. But I thought that the parity condition was satisfied.\n\nSo which one is it? Let's re-examine.\n\nIn option D: L' =1, l=0. So L' + l =1, which is odd. So parity is satisfied.\n\nBut for orbital angular momentum, initial L=0. Final orbital angular momentum is L' + l=1. So that's a change, which violates conservation of orbital angular momentum. Therefore, this transition is not allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that perhaps the total angular momentum (including spin) must be conserved, not just orbital. But if the orbital isn't conserved, then the transition is forbidden.\n\nSo which options have L' + l equal to 0? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, the only way L' + l =0 is if both are zero. So any option where L' + l \u22600 would violate angular momentum conservation, except if the sum of the spin angular momenta compensates. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is not conserved on its own, but the total angular momentum (including spin) is conserved. So J_initial =0, so J_final must be 0.\n\nIn option D: J' is 0, j_x is 0 (since l=0, assuming X is spin 0). So J_final=0, which is okay. But orbital angular momentum: L' is 1, l=0. So L' + l=1. So that's a problem because the initial L was 0.\n\nHmm, but perhaps orbital angular momentum is not being conserved because X carries away some angular momentum. Wait, no, because in the center of mass frame, orbital angular momentum is conserved. So if the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the final must also be zero. So in option D, L' + l =1, which is not zero. So this transition would violate orbital angular momentum conservation. Therefore, option D is not allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the parity condition was satisfied in all options except maybe one. So in which option is parity not satisfied?\n\nWait, let me recheck each option's L' + l:\n\nOption A: L'=2, l=1 \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 parity condition met.\n\nOption B: L'=0, l=1 \u2192 sum 1 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition met.\n\nOption C: L'=2, l=3 \u2192 sum 5 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition met.\n\nOption D: L'=1, l=0 \u2192 sum 1 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition met.\n\nSo all options meet the parity condition. Then why is option D not allowed? Because it violates angular momentum conservation.\n\nSo the question is, which partial wave (i.e., which l of X) is not permitted. So the option where the angular momentum isn't conserved is the answer.\n\nSo, in option D, the orbital angular momentum after emission is L' + l =1. Initial was 0. So that's a problem. Therefore, option D is not allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in option D, the total J_final is 0, which is allowed. So why is the orbital angular momentum a problem?\n\nAh, because orbital angular momentum is a part of the total angular momentum. If the total J_final is zero, but the orbital angular momenta sum to 1, that would require that the spin angular momenta sum to -1, which isn't possible because spin is a non-negative integer or half-integer. So it's impossible for the spin part to compensate for an orbital part of 1 to make the total J zero.\n\nWait, but the spin part is S' (spin of NN') plus s_x (spin of X). But the problem doesn't give us the spin of X. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum must be conserved because the system is emitting X. So the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of L' and l must be zero. So L' must equal l.\n\nLooking at each option:\n\nOption A: L' =2, l=1 \u2192 2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nOption B: L'=0, l=1 \u2192 0\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: L'=2, l=3 \u2192 2\u22603 \u2192 no.\n\nOption D: L'=1, l=0 \u2192 1\u22600 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, but none of the options have L' = l. So that would mean all transitions are forbidden. But that can't be right.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system and X are such that their sum equals the initial orbital angular momentum, which is zero. So L' - l =0 \u2192 L' = l.\n\nBecause orbital angular momentum is a vector, so the sum L' + (-l) =0 \u2192 L'=l. Because direction matters.\n\nSo for each option, check if L' equals l.\n\nOption A: L'=2, l=1 \u2192 no.\n\nOption B: L'=0, l=1 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: L'=2, l=3 \u2192 no.\n\nOption D: L'=1, l=0 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, that can't be right because none of the options would be allowed. So perhaps that approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: considering that the initial state has orbital angular momentum L=0, so the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN' and X must be zero. So L' (of NN') and l (of X) must satisfy L' = l. Because L' + (-l) =0 \u2192 L'=l.\n\nSo only transitions where L' equals l are allowed.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: L'=2, l=1 \u2192 no.\n\nOption B: L'=0, l=1 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: L'=2, l=3 \u2192 no.\n\nOption D: L'=1, l=0 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, none of them satisfy L'=l. So all options are forbidden. But that's impossible because the question expects one option to be forbidden.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again about the problem.\n\nThe question says that the final NN state has T=0, which gives us the condition S + L \u22611 mod2.\n\nSo for each option, the final NN' state has S' and L', and S' + L' must be odd.\n\nLet's compute S' + L' for each option.\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 S'=3, L'=2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition met.\n\nOption B:3S1 \u2192 S'=1, L'=0 \u2192 1+0=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition met.\n\nOption C:3D3 \u2192 S'=1, L'=2 \u21921+2=3 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition met.\n\nOption D:3P0 \u2192 S'=1, L'=1 \u21921+1=2 \u2192 even \u2192 condition not met.\n\nWait a minute! So option D's final state has S' + L' =2, which is even. But the condition requires S' + L' to be odd. So this violates the Pauli statistics condition. Therefore, option D is not allowed.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the parity and angular momentum conditions were okay for D. But this condition from Pauli statistics isn't met in D. So that would make D not allowed.\n\nWait, but wait. The condition is T= S + L +1 mod2. And T is 0, so:\n\n0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L =1 mod2.\n\nSo for option D: S' =1, L'=1 \u2192 S + L = 2 \u2192 0 mod2. Which doesn't equal 1. So this is a violation.\n\nSo option D's final state doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition, so it's forbidden.\n\nSo the answer is option D.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option D had L' + l =1, which violates orbital angular momentum conservation. But now, considering the Pauli condition, option D is forbidden because S' + L' is even. So that's the correct reason.\n\nSo the conclusion is that option D is not allowed because it doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition (S' + L' is even, but it needs to be odd).\n\n\nThe problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a \\( ^1S_0 \\) state emitting a particle \\( X \\) with intrinsic parity \\(-1\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this involves some quantum mechanics concepts, specifically angular momentum and parity conservation. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nThe problem states that a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emits a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Wait, I think this is about the conservation of certain quantum numbers during the interaction.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0, so I need to figure out what that means in terms of the quantum numbers. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). For 1S0, that would mean S=0 because 2S+1 =1 \u2192 S=0. Then L is S, so L=0? Wait, no, wait. The term is written as (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S is the total spin, which is 0. Then L is the orbital angular momentum, which in spectroscopic notation, S is 0. So L is 0. Then J is the total angular momentum, which is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nNow, when they emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The problem is about the final NN state after emission. The Pauli condition says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum? Or is S the total spin? Hmm, wait, the problem says \"Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\" Oh, okay. So the condition is T = S + L + 1 mod 2.\n\nWait, but the initial state is 1S0, which as I said, has S=0 (spin), L=0 (orbital), so J=0. But in the final state, the NN state has T=0. So according to the Pauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod 2. Plugging in T=0: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2. So S + L must be odd. That means either S is odd and L even, or S even and L odd. But S and L are angular momentum quantum numbers, which are integers. So S could be 0,1,2,... Similarly for L.\n\nWait, but in the final state, the NN state has to have certain S and L. So for the final NN state, S + L must be odd.\n\nNow, the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are about the emitted particle X's angular momentum state. The options are something like 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p, etc. So each option describes the process where the initial state is 1S0, and the NN state after emission has a certain term, and X has a specific l.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X\". So each option shows the initial state (1S0) going to a final state (like 7D1) plus X with a certain l (p, s, etc).\n\nI think I need to apply conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nFirst, let me think about the parity. The initial state has a parity. The parity of the NN system in a state with orbital angular momentum L is given by (-1)^L. Because the parity operator flips the orbital angular momentum part as (-1)^L. The initial state is 1S0, which is L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = 1.\n\nAfter emission, the final NN state has some L, say L_final, and the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l. The total parity after emission should be the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. Because when X is emitted, it carries away some angular momentum, and the parity of the entire system (final NN plus X) must conserve the overall parity, considering the initial state.\n\nWait, but the initial state is parity 1. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. So: parity_initial = parity_final.\n\nSo, parity_initial = 1 = parity_NN * parity_X.\n\nThe parity of X is (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of X. The parity of the NN state is (-1)^{L_final}.\n\nSo: 1 = (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^l \u2192 (-1)^{L_final + l} = 1 \u2192 L_final + l must be even. So L_final and l must have the same parity. That is, both even or both odd.\n\nSo for each option, I can compute L_final and l, and check if their sum is even.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nOption A) 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p\n\nWait, the final state is 7D1. Let me parse the term symbol. The term is (2S+1)L(J). So for 7D1: (2S+1) =7 \u2192 S=3. L is D, which is 2. J is 1.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial state is 1S0, so after emitting X, the NN state is 7D1. So for the final NN state, S =3, L=2, J=1.\n\nWait, but earlier we had the Pauli condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. T=0. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. S is 3 (so mod 2 is 1), L is 2 (mod 2 is 0). So 1 + 0 =1 mod 2. So that works, because T is 0. So the Pauli condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, the emitted particle X is p. So what is l for X? p is l=1.\n\nSo for option A, L_final =2, l=1. Sum is 3, which is odd. So parity condition is violated. So this option is not allowed.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Because the initial parity is 1. The final parity would be (-1)^{2} * (-1)^1 = (1) * (-1) = -1. Which would not match the initial parity. So this can't happen. So option A is not allowed.\n\nOption B) 1S0 \u21923S1 + p\n\nSo the final NN state is 3S1. The term is (2S+1)L(J)=3S1. So S=1, L=0 (S is orbital S=0?), wait no. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 3S1 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is S (since it's S orbital) \u2192 L=0. J=1.\n\nSo for the Pauli condition: S=1, L=0. S + L =1 +0=1 \u2192 mod2 is 1. So T=0=1+1 mod2? Wait, T=0 = (S + L +1) mod2. S + L is 1, plus 1 is 2 mod2 is 0. So yes, T=0. So condition is satisfied.\n\nThe emitted X is p, l=1. The final NN state has L=0. So L_final + l =0 +1=1, which is odd. So parity condition not met. So this is not allowed. So option B is invalid.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The initial parity is 1. The final parity is (-1)^{0} * (-1)^1 = 1 * (-1) = -1. Which is not equal to initial parity 1. So this would violate parity conservation. So option B is not allowed.\n\nWait, but the problem says which partial wave is not permitted. So if any of these options have parity not conserved, they are invalid. So both A and B have parity not conserved.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's look at other options.\n\nOption C) 1S0 \u21923D3 + f\n\nThe final NN state is 3D3. Term is (2S+1)L(J)=3D3. So 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is D\u21922. J=3.\n\nSo S=1, L=2.\n\nPauli condition: T=0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L = (1 + 2) =3 \u2192 mod2 is 1. So 1 +1=2 mod2=0 \u2192 T=0. So condition is satisfied.\n\nThe emitted X is f, which is l=3 (f orbitals have l=3).\n\nSo L_final is 2, l=3. Sum is 5, which is odd. So parity would be (-1)^2 * (-1)^3= 1 * (-1) =-1. But initial parity is 1, so this is not allowed. So option C is not permitted.\n\nOption D) 1S0 \u21923P0 + s\n\nFinal NN state is 3P0. Term is (2S+1)L(J)=3P0. 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is P\u21921. J=0.\n\nPauli condition: T=0 = S + L +1 mod2. S=1, L=1. S + L=2 \u2192 mod2 is 0. 0 +1=1 mod2=1. But T is 0. So condition is 0=1 mod2? That's not true. So this would violate the Pauli condition. So option D is invalid.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute S + L for the final state in option D. S=1, L=1. Sum is 2. Then T = (S + L +1) mod2 \u2192 (2 +1) mod2=3 mod2=1. But the problem says T(NN)=0. So T=1\u22600. So this violates the Pauli condition. So option D is not allowed.\n\nBut wait, the initial state has J=0. The final state has J=0. How does that work with angular momentum conservation? Because the initial angular momentum is J=0, the final must also have J=0.\n\nWait, but the problem is about partial waves, which are about the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So perhaps the total angular momentum is conserved.\n\nWait, the initial state has J=0. The final NN state has J=0 in option D, and the X has some orbital angular momentum l, which affects the total angular momentum.\n\nBut I think I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about angular momentum conservation in each option.\n\nWait, the initial state has J=0. The final state must have the same total J. So the total angular momentum after emission is the sum of the NN's J and X's l (but wait, that's not exactly correct because J is the total angular momentum, which includes spin and orbital parts). Hmm, maybe I should consider the total angular momentum of the system before and after.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is l, and the NN state's orbital angular momentum is L_final. But the total orbital angular momentum of the system (NN + X) must be equal to the initial orbital angular momentum of the system, which is L_initial =0 (since initial state is 1S0 with L=0).\n\nWait, but that's not correct because when the particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum is carried away by X and the NN system. So the initial orbital angular momentum is zero. After emission, the total orbital angular momentum of NN and X must add up to zero.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the angular momentum carried by X. The emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN state must be L_final = -l, perhaps? Because the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so L_initial + l_initial =0 \u2192 L_final (NN) + l (X) =0.\n\nWait, but angular momentum is conserved, so the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN and X must be equal to the initial orbital angular momentum, which is zero. So L_final (NN) + l (X) =0 mod something? Or perhaps their vector sum is zero.\n\nBut angular momentum is a vector quantity, so the sum should be zero. So L_final and l must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. But for quantum numbers, this would imply L_final = l. Because orbital angular momentum is quantized in integer steps. Wait, but that's only possible if L_final = l, because their vector sum can't be zero unless they're opposite, but in quantum terms, their magnitudes must be the same.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, when you have two angular momenta, their sum can be any value from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. So for the sum to be zero, the only possibility is if L_final = l and their angular momenta are opposite, but that's a specific case. Alternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum after emission must match the initial, which is zero.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial state has J=0 (total angular momentum), so the final state must have the same J. The final J is the sum of the NN's J and X's l (but including their spin as well, which complicates things). Hmm, this is getting a bit too involved.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle and the NN system must add up to zero. So L_final (NN) + l (X) =0. So L_final = l.\n\nWait, but in that case, L_final must equal l. So for each option, L_final (NN) must equal l (X). Let's check.\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 L_final=2, X is p\u2192 l=1. So 2\u22601. So this would violate angular momentum conservation. So option A is not allowed.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 L_final=0, X is p\u2192 l=1. 0\u22601 \u2192 not allowed.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 L_final=2, X is f\u2192 l=3. 2\u22603 \u2192 not allowed.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 L_final=1, X is s\u2192 l=0. 1\u22600 \u2192 not allowed.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because all options would be invalid, but the question states that only one is not permitted.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN system is L_final. The initial system's orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of L_final and l must be zero. So L_final = l.\n\nWait, that's only possible if L_final = l. So for each option, we can check if L_final equals l.\n\nOption A: L_final=2 (from 7D1), l=1 (p). 2\u22601 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l=1 \u2192 0\u22601 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l=3 \u2192 2\u22603 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l=0 \u2192 1\u22600 \u2192 invalid.\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because all options would be invalid, which isn't the case. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is not the same as its l. Or maybe I'm confusing orbital angular momentum with total angular momentum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the emitted particle's angular momentum is not just orbital, but includes spin. But the problem states that the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X, which I think refers to the orbital angular momentum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system must satisfy L_final = l. So in that case, for each option:\n\nOption A: L_final=2, l=1 \u2192 2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l=1 \u2192 0\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l=3 \u2192 2\u22603 \u2192 no.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l=0 \u2192 1\u22600 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm, this suggests all options are invalid, which can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so the total orbital angular momentum after emission is zero. The sum of the NN's L and X's l must be zero. But since orbital angular momentum is a vector, the sum can only be zero if L_final = l and their directions are opposite. But in quantum terms, this would mean that L_final = l, because you can't have a negative l. So for each option, L_final must equal l.\n\nWait, that would mean only options where L_final equals l are allowed.\n\nLooking again:\n\nOption A: L_final=2, l=1 \u2192 2\u22601 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l=1 \u2192 0\u22601 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l=3 \u2192 2\u22603 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l=0 \u21921\u22600 \u2192 invalid.\n\nBut again, all options are invalid, which can't be correct. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is not l, but the orbital angular momentum of the NN system is L_final, and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is l. But the initial system's orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum must be zero. So the vector sum of L_final and l must be zero. But that's only possible if L_final = l and they are opposite in direction. But in quantum terms, their magnitudes must be the same, but opposite in direction.\n\nBut in terms of quantum numbers, the only way this can happen is if L_final = l, because the magnitude must match. So L_final must equal l.\n\nThus, only the options where L_final equals l are allowed.\n\nLooking again:\n\nOption A: L_final=2, l=1 \u2192 2\u22601 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l=1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l=3 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l=0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nHmm, this can't be. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption here.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X is not l, but the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of the NN's L and X's l must be zero. But that's only possible if L_final = l and their directions are opposite, which in quantum terms implies L_final = l, but that's only possible if l is the same as L_final, but for each option, that's not the case. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding what l represents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is not l but something else. Wait, the problem states that the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So for example, 'p' is l=1, 's' is l=0, 'f' is l=3, 'd' is l=2.\n\nSo for each option:\n\nOption A: X is p \u2192 l=1. NN's L_final=2. So 2 +1=3, which can't be zero. So parity is violated as earlier.\n\nOption B: X is p \u2192 l=1. NN's L_final=0. So 0 +1=1\u22600.\n\nOption C: X is f \u2192 l=3. NN's L_final=2. 2+3=5\u22600.\n\nOption D: X is s \u2192 l=0. NN's L_final=1. 1+0=1\u22600.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the parity condition.\n\nThe initial parity is 1. The final parity is (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^l.\n\nSo for each option, compute (-1)^{L_final + l} and see if it equals 1.\n\nOption A: L_final=2, l=1 \u2192 2+1=3 \u2192 (-1)^3 = -1. Not equal to initial parity 1. So invalid.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l=1 \u2192 0+1=1 \u2192 (-1)^1 =-1. Invalid.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l=3 \u2192 2+3=5 \u2192 (-1)^5=-1. Invalid.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l=0 \u21921+0=1 \u2192 (-1)^1=-1. Invalid.\n\nWait, so all options would have parity -1, which would violate initial parity of 1. But that can't be right because the question says one is not permitted.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the parity of the final state. Let me think again.\n\nThe parity of the NN state is (-1)^{L_final}, and the parity of X is (-1)^l. The total parity after emission is the product of these two, multiplied by the parity of the initial state? Or is it that the parity of the system is the product?\n\nWait, the initial state has parity P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. Since L_initial is 0, P_initial=1.\n\nAfter emission, the parity of the NN state is P_NN = (-1)^{L_final}, and the parity of X is P_X = (-1)^l. The total parity of the system (NN + X) would be P_NN * P_X. But since the initial parity is 1, we have:\n\nP_initial = P_NN * P_X \u2192 1 = (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^l \u2192 (-1)^{L_final + l} =1 \u2192 L_final + l must be even.\n\nSo for each option, check if L_final + l is even.\n\nOption A: L_final=2, l=1 \u2192 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l=1 \u21921 \u2192 odd \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l=3 \u21925 \u2192 odd \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l=0 \u21921 \u2192 odd \u2192 invalid.\n\nHmm, all options are invalid, which can't be the case. So I must have made a mistake in determining the parity.\n\nWait, perhaps the parity of X is not just (-1)^l. Wait, the parity of a particle depends on its orbital angular momentum and any intrinsic parity. The problem states that particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the total parity of X is intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l. So P_X = (-1)^l * intrinsic parity. Since intrinsic parity is -1, P_X = (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nSo the parity of the final system would be P_NN * P_X = [(-1)^{L_final}] * [(-1)^{l+1}] = (-1)^{L_final + l +1}.\n\nThis must equal the initial parity of 1.\n\nSo:\n\n(-1)^{L_final + l +1} =1 \u2192 (-1)^{L_final + l} = (-1)^1 \u2192 so L_final + l must be odd.\n\nWait, that changes things. So the condition is L_final + l must be odd.\n\nNow, let's recheck each option.\n\nOption A: L_final=2, l=1 \u2192 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition satisfied. So parity is 1. So this is allowed.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l=1 \u21921 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition satisfied. So parity is 1. Allowed.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l=3 \u21925 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition satisfied. Allowed.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l=0 \u21921 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition satisfied. Allowed.\n\nWait, but this can't be right because the question states that one is not permitted.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the parity of X. Let me re-express the parity calculation.\n\nThe initial parity is 1.\n\nThe final parity is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X.\n\nThe parity of the NN state is (-1)^{L_final}.\n\nThe parity of X is (-1)^{l} multiplied by its intrinsic parity. Since X's intrinsic parity is -1, P_X = (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nSo the total final parity is (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{l+1} = (-1)^{L_final + l +1}.\n\nWe must have this equal to initial parity of 1.\n\nSo:\n\n(-1)^{L_final + l +1} =1 \u2192 (-1)^{L_final + l} = (-1)^1 \u2192 L_final + l must be odd.\n\nSo for each option, check if L_final + l is odd.\n\nOption A: 2+1=3 \u2192 odd \u2192 yes.\n\nOption B: 0+1=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 yes.\n\nOption C:2+3=5 \u2192 odd \u2192 yes.\n\nOption D:1+0=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 yes.\n\nHmm, so all options have L_final + l odd, so parity is conserved. So the parity condition doesn't eliminate any options. So I must look elsewhere.\n\nNow, back to the Pauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod2.\n\nThe final NN state has T=0, so S + L +1 \u22610 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u22611 mod2.\n\nSo for each option, compute S (spin) and L (orbital) of the final NN state and check if S + L is odd.\n\nLet's go through each option.\n\nOption A: Final state is 7D1. Term symbol (2S+1)L(J) \u2192 7D1.\n\n2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3. L is D\u21922. So S=3, L=2.\n\nS + L =3 +2=5 \u2192 mod2=1 \u2192 which satisfies the Pauli condition. So allowed.\n\nOption B: Final state is 3S1 \u2192 (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L is S\u21920. So S=1, L=0. S+L=1 \u2192 mod2=1 \u2192 condition satisfied. Allowed.\n\nOption C: Final state is 3D3. S=1, L=2. S+L=3 \u2192 mod2=1 \u2192 condition satisfied. Allowed.\n\nOption D: Final state is 3P0. S=1, L=1. S+L=2 \u2192 mod2=0. Which does not satisfy the condition (needs to be 1). So Pauli condition is violated. So option D is not allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier when I checked parity, all options were allowed. So the Pauli condition in option D is the problem. So option D is not permitted.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks which partial wave is not permitted. So option D is invalid because it violates the Pauli condition.\n\nWait, but the question is about the partial wave of X. So in option D, X has l=0 (s-state), which is allowed in terms of parity and angular momentum, but the Pauli condition is violated, making the process impossible.\n\nSo the answer is option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this involves some quantum mechanics concepts, specifically angular momentum and parity conservation. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nThe problem states that a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emits a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Wait, I think this is about the conservation of certain quantum numbers during the interaction.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0, so I need to figure out what that means in terms of the quantum numbers. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). For 1S0, that would mean S=0 because 2S+1 =1 \u2192 S=0. Then L is S, so L=0? Wait, no, wait. The term is written as (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S is the total spin, which is 0. Then L is the orbital angular momentum, which in spectroscopic notation, S is 0. So L is 0. Then J is the total angular momentum, which is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nNow, when they emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The problem is about the final NN state after emission. The Pauli condition says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum? Or is S the total spin? Hmm, wait, the problem says \"Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\" Oh, okay. So the condition is T = S + L + 1 mod 2.\n\nWait, but the initial state is 1S0, which as I said, has S=0 (spin), L=0 (orbital), so J=0. But in the final state, the NN state has T=0. So according to the Pauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod 2. Plugging in T=0: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2. So S + L must be odd. That means either S is odd and L even, or S even and L odd. But S and L are angular momentum quantum numbers, which are integers. So S could be 0,1,2,... Similarly for L.\n\nWait, but in the final state, the NN state has to have certain S and L. So for the final NN state, S + L must be odd.\n\nNow, the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are about the emitted particle X's angular momentum state. The options are something like 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p, etc. So each option describes the process where the initial state is 1S0, and the NN state after emission has a certain term, and X has a specific l.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X\". So each option shows the initial state (1S0) going to a final state (like 7D1) plus X with a certain l (p, s, etc).\n\nI think I need to apply conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nFirst, let me think about the parity. The initial state has a parity. The parity of the NN system in a state with orbital angular momentum L is given by (-1)^L. Because the parity operator flips the orbital angular momentum part as (-1)^L. The initial state is 1S0, which is L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = 1.\n\nAfter emission, the final NN state has some L, say L_final, and the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l. The total parity after emission should be the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. Because when X is emitted, it carries away some angular momentum, and the parity of the entire system (final NN plus X) must conserve the overall parity, considering the initial state.\n\nWait, but the initial state is parity 1. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. So: parity_initial = parity_final.\n\nSo, parity_initial = 1 = parity_NN * parity_X.\n\nThe parity of X is (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of X. The parity of the NN state is (-1)^{L_final}.\n\nSo: 1 = (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^l \u2192 (-1)^{L_final + l} = 1 \u2192 L_final + l must be even. So L_final and l must have the same parity. That is, both even or both odd.\n\nSo for each option, I can compute L_final and l, and check if their sum is even.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nOption A) 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p\n\nWait, the final state is 7D1. Let me parse the term symbol. The term is (2S+1)L(J). So for 7D1: (2S+1) =7 \u2192 S=3. L is D, which is 2. J is 1.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial state is 1S0, so after emitting X, the NN state is 7D1. So for the final NN state, S =3, L=2, J=1.\n\nWait, but earlier we had the Pauli condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. T=0. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. S is 3 (so mod 2 is 1), L is 2 (mod 2 is 0). So 1 + 0 =1 mod 2. So that works, because T is 0. So the Pauli condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, the emitted particle X is p. So what is l for X? p is l=1.\n\nSo for option A, L_final =2, l=1. Sum is 3, which is odd. So parity condition is violated. So this option is not allowed.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Because the initial parity is 1. The final parity would be (-1)^{2} * (-1)^1 = (1) * (-1) = -1. Which would not match the initial parity. So this can't happen. So option A is not allowed.\n\nOption B) 1S0 \u21923S1 + p\n\nSo the final NN state is 3S1. The term is (2S+1)L(J)=3S1. So S=1, L=0 (S is orbital S=0?), wait no. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 3S1 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is S (since it's S orbital) \u2192 L=0. J=1.\n\nSo for the Pauli condition: S=1, L=0. S + L =1 +0=1 \u2192 mod2 is 1. So T=0=1+1 mod2? Wait, T=0 = (S + L +1) mod2. S + L is 1, plus 1 is 2 mod2 is 0. So yes, T=0. So condition is satisfied.\n\nThe emitted X is p, l=1. The final NN state has L=0. So L_final + l =0 +1=1, which is odd. So parity condition not met. So this is not allowed. So option B is invalid.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The initial parity is 1. The final parity is (-1)^{0} * (-1)^1 = 1 * (-1) = -1. Which is not equal to initial parity 1. So this would violate parity conservation. So option B is not allowed.\n\nWait, but the problem says which partial wave is not permitted. So if any of these options have parity not conserved, they are invalid. So both A and B have parity not conserved.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's look at other options.\n\nOption C) 1S0 \u21923D3 + f\n\nThe final NN state is 3D3. Term is (2S+1)L(J)=3D3. So 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is D\u21922. J=3.\n\nSo S=1, L=2.\n\nPauli condition: T=0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L = (1 + 2) =3 \u2192 mod2 is 1. So 1 +1=2 mod2=0 \u2192 T=0. So condition is satisfied.\n\nThe emitted X is f, which is l=3 (f orbitals have l=3).\n\nSo L_final is 2, l=3. Sum is 5, which is odd. So parity would be (-1)^2 * (-1)^3= 1 * (-1) =-1. But initial parity is 1, so this is not allowed. So option C is not permitted.\n\nOption D) 1S0 \u21923P0 + s\n\nFinal NN state is 3P0. Term is (2S+1)L(J)=3P0. 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is P\u21921. J=0.\n\nPauli condition: T=0 = S + L +1 mod2. S=1, L=1. S + L=2 \u2192 mod2 is 0. 0 +1=1 mod2=1. But T is 0. So condition is 0=1 mod2? That's not true. So this would violate the Pauli condition. So option D is invalid.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute S + L for the final state in option D. S=1, L=1. Sum is 2. Then T = (S + L +1) mod2 \u2192 (2 +1) mod2=3 mod2=1. But the problem says T(NN)=0. So T=1\u22600. So this violates the Pauli condition. So option D is not allowed.\n\nBut wait, the initial state has J=0. The final state has J=0. How does that work with angular momentum conservation? Because the initial angular momentum is J=0, the final must also have J=0.\n\nWait, but the problem is about partial waves, which are about the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So perhaps the total angular momentum is conserved.\n\nWait, the initial state has J=0. The final NN state has J=0 in option D, and the X has some orbital angular momentum l, which affects the total angular momentum.\n\nBut I think I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about angular momentum conservation in each option.\n\nWait, the initial state has J=0. The final state must have the same total J. So the total angular momentum after emission is the sum of the NN's J and X's l (but wait, that's not exactly correct because J is the total angular momentum, which includes spin and orbital parts). Hmm, maybe I should consider the total angular momentum of the system before and after.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is l, and the NN state's orbital angular momentum is L_final. But the total orbital angular momentum of the system (NN + X) must be equal to the initial orbital angular momentum of the system, which is L_initial =0 (since initial state is 1S0 with L=0).\n\nWait, but that's not correct because when the particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum is carried away by X and the NN system. So the initial orbital angular momentum is zero. After emission, the total orbital angular momentum of NN and X must add up to zero.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the angular momentum carried by X. The emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN state must be L_final = -l, perhaps? Because the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so L_initial + l_initial =0 \u2192 L_final (NN) + l (X) =0.\n\nWait, but angular momentum is conserved, so the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the NN and X must be equal to the initial orbital angular momentum, which is zero. So L_final (NN) + l (X) =0 mod something? Or perhaps their vector sum is zero.\n\nBut angular momentum is a vector quantity, so the sum should be zero. So L_final and l must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. But for quantum numbers, this would imply L_final = l. Because orbital angular momentum is quantized in integer steps. Wait, but that's only possible if L_final = l, because their vector sum can't be zero unless they're opposite, but in quantum terms, their magnitudes must be the same.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, when you have two angular momenta, their sum can be any value from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. So for the sum to be zero, the only possibility is if L_final = l and their angular momenta are opposite, but that's a specific case. Alternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum after emission must match the initial, which is zero.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial state has J=0 (total angular momentum), so the final state must have the same J. The final J is the sum of the NN's J and X's l (but including their spin as well, which complicates things). Hmm, this is getting a bit too involved.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle and the NN system must add up to zero. So L_final (NN) + l (X) =0. So L_final = l.\n\nWait, but in that case, L_final must equal l. So for each option, L_final (NN) must equal l (X). Let's check.\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 L_final=2, X is p\u2192 l=1. So 2\u22601. So this would violate angular momentum conservation. So option A is not allowed.\n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 L_final=0, X is p\u2192 l=1. 0\u22601 \u2192 not allowed.\n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 L_final=2, X is f\u2192 l=3. 2\u22603 \u2192 not allowed.\n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 L_final=1, X is s\u2192 l=0. 1\u22600 \u2192 not allowed.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because all options would be invalid, but the question states that only one is not permitted.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN system is L_final. The initial system's orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of L_final and l must be zero. So L_final = l.\n\nWait, that's only possible if L_final = l. So for each option, we can check if L_final equals l.\n\nOption A: L_final=2 (from 7D1), l=1 (p). 2\u22601 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l=1 \u2192 0\u22601 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l=3 \u2192 2\u22603 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l=0 \u2192 1\u22600 \u2192 invalid.\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because all options would be invalid, which isn't the case. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is not the same as its l. Or maybe I'm confusing orbital angular momentum with total angular momentum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the emitted particle's angular momentum is not just orbital, but includes spin. But the problem states that the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X, which I think refers to the orbital angular momentum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system must satisfy L_final = l. So in that case, for each option:\n\nOption A: L_final=2, l=1 \u2192 2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l=1 \u2192 0\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l=3 \u2192 2\u22603 \u2192 no.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l=0 \u2192 1\u22600 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm, this suggests all options are invalid, which can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so the total orbital angular momentum after emission is zero. The sum of the NN's L and X's l must be zero. But since orbital angular momentum is a vector, the sum can only be zero if L_final = l and their directions are opposite. But in quantum terms, this would mean that L_final = l, because you can't have a negative l. So for each option, L_final must equal l.\n\nWait, that would mean only options where L_final equals l are allowed.\n\nLooking again:\n\nOption A: L_final=2, l=1 \u2192 2\u22601 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l=1 \u2192 0\u22601 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l=3 \u2192 2\u22603 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l=0 \u21921\u22600 \u2192 invalid.\n\nBut again, all options are invalid, which can't be correct. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is not l, but the orbital angular momentum of the NN system is L_final, and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is l. But the initial system's orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum must be zero. So the vector sum of L_final and l must be zero. But that's only possible if L_final = l and they are opposite in direction. But in quantum terms, their magnitudes must be the same, but opposite in direction.\n\nBut in terms of quantum numbers, the only way this can happen is if L_final = l, because the magnitude must match. So L_final must equal l.\n\nThus, only the options where L_final equals l are allowed.\n\nLooking again:\n\nOption A: L_final=2, l=1 \u2192 2\u22601 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l=1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l=3 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l=0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nHmm, this can't be. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption here.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X is not l, but the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of the NN's L and X's l must be zero. But that's only possible if L_final = l and their directions are opposite, which in quantum terms implies L_final = l, but that's only possible if l is the same as L_final, but for each option, that's not the case. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding what l represents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is not l but something else. Wait, the problem states that the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So for example, 'p' is l=1, 's' is l=0, 'f' is l=3, 'd' is l=2.\n\nSo for each option:\n\nOption A: X is p \u2192 l=1. NN's L_final=2. So 2 +1=3, which can't be zero. So parity is violated as earlier.\n\nOption B: X is p \u2192 l=1. NN's L_final=0. So 0 +1=1\u22600.\n\nOption C: X is f \u2192 l=3. NN's L_final=2. 2+3=5\u22600.\n\nOption D: X is s \u2192 l=0. NN's L_final=1. 1+0=1\u22600.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the parity condition.\n\nThe initial parity is 1. The final parity is (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^l.\n\nSo for each option, compute (-1)^{L_final + l} and see if it equals 1.\n\nOption A: L_final=2, l=1 \u2192 2+1=3 \u2192 (-1)^3 = -1. Not equal to initial parity 1. So invalid.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l=1 \u2192 0+1=1 \u2192 (-1)^1 =-1. Invalid.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l=3 \u2192 2+3=5 \u2192 (-1)^5=-1. Invalid.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l=0 \u21921+0=1 \u2192 (-1)^1=-1. Invalid.\n\nWait, so all options would have parity -1, which would violate initial parity of 1. But that can't be right because the question says one is not permitted.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the parity of the final state. Let me think again.\n\nThe parity of the NN state is (-1)^{L_final}, and the parity of X is (-1)^l. The total parity after emission is the product of these two, multiplied by the parity of the initial state? Or is it that the parity of the system is the product?\n\nWait, the initial state has parity P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. Since L_initial is 0, P_initial=1.\n\nAfter emission, the parity of the NN state is P_NN = (-1)^{L_final}, and the parity of X is P_X = (-1)^l. The total parity of the system (NN + X) would be P_NN * P_X. But since the initial parity is 1, we have:\n\nP_initial = P_NN * P_X \u2192 1 = (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^l \u2192 (-1)^{L_final + l} =1 \u2192 L_final + l must be even.\n\nSo for each option, check if L_final + l is even.\n\nOption A: L_final=2, l=1 \u2192 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l=1 \u21921 \u2192 odd \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l=3 \u21925 \u2192 odd \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l=0 \u21921 \u2192 odd \u2192 invalid.\n\nHmm, all options are invalid, which can't be the case. So I must have made a mistake in determining the parity.\n\nWait, perhaps the parity of X is not just (-1)^l. Wait, the parity of a particle depends on its orbital angular momentum and any intrinsic parity. The problem states that particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the total parity of X is intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l. So P_X = (-1)^l * intrinsic parity. Since intrinsic parity is -1, P_X = (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nSo the parity of the final system would be P_NN * P_X = [(-1)^{L_final}] * [(-1)^{l+1}] = (-1)^{L_final + l +1}.\n\nThis must equal the initial parity of 1.\n\nSo:\n\n(-1)^{L_final + l +1} =1 \u2192 (-1)^{L_final + l} = (-1)^1 \u2192 so L_final + l must be odd.\n\nWait, that changes things. So the condition is L_final + l must be odd.\n\nNow, let's recheck each option.\n\nOption A: L_final=2, l=1 \u2192 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition satisfied. So parity is 1. So this is allowed.\n\nOption B: L_final=0, l=1 \u21921 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition satisfied. So parity is 1. Allowed.\n\nOption C: L_final=2, l=3 \u21925 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition satisfied. Allowed.\n\nOption D: L_final=1, l=0 \u21921 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition satisfied. Allowed.\n\nWait, but this can't be right because the question states that one is not permitted.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the parity of X. Let me re-express the parity calculation.\n\nThe initial parity is 1.\n\nThe final parity is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X.\n\nThe parity of the NN state is (-1)^{L_final}.\n\nThe parity of X is (-1)^{l} multiplied by its intrinsic parity. Since X's intrinsic parity is -1, P_X = (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nSo the total final parity is (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{l+1} = (-1)^{L_final + l +1}.\n\nWe must have this equal to initial parity of 1.\n\nSo:\n\n(-1)^{L_final + l +1} =1 \u2192 (-1)^{L_final + l} = (-1)^1 \u2192 L_final + l must be odd.\n\nSo for each option, check if L_final + l is odd.\n\nOption A: 2+1=3 \u2192 odd \u2192 yes.\n\nOption B: 0+1=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 yes.\n\nOption C:2+3=5 \u2192 odd \u2192 yes.\n\nOption D:1+0=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 yes.\n\nHmm, so all options have L_final + l odd, so parity is conserved. So the parity condition doesn't eliminate any options. So I must look elsewhere.\n\nNow, back to the Pauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod2.\n\nThe final NN state has T=0, so S + L +1 \u22610 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u22611 mod2.\n\nSo for each option, compute S (spin) and L (orbital) of the final NN state and check if S + L is odd.\n\nLet's go through each option.\n\nOption A: Final state is 7D1. Term symbol (2S+1)L(J) \u2192 7D1.\n\n2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3. L is D\u21922. So S=3, L=2.\n\nS + L =3 +2=5 \u2192 mod2=1 \u2192 which satisfies the Pauli condition. So allowed.\n\nOption B: Final state is 3S1 \u2192 (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L is S\u21920. So S=1, L=0. S+L=1 \u2192 mod2=1 \u2192 condition satisfied. Allowed.\n\nOption C: Final state is 3D3. S=1, L=2. S+L=3 \u2192 mod2=1 \u2192 condition satisfied. Allowed.\n\nOption D: Final state is 3P0. S=1, L=1. S+L=2 \u2192 mod2=0. Which does not satisfy the condition (needs to be 1). So Pauli condition is violated. So option D is not allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier when I checked parity, all options were allowed. So the Pauli condition in option D is the problem. So option D is not permitted.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks which partial wave is not permitted. So option D is invalid because it violates the Pauli condition.\n\nWait, but the question is about the partial wave of X. So in option D, X has l=0 (s-state), which is allowed in terms of parity and angular momentum, but the Pauli condition is violated, making the process impossible.\n\nSo the answer is option D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions: conservation of parity and the Pauli condition \\( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2) \\). The initial state is \\( 1S_0 \\), which has \\( S = 0 \\), \\( L = 0 \\), and \\( J = 0 \\). The emitted particle \\( X \\) has intrinsic parity \\(-1\\), and the parity of the final system must match the initial parity of 1. The parity of the final system is given by:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{final}} = P_{\\text{NN}} \\cdot P_X = (-1)^{L_{\\text{final}}} \\cdot (-1)^{l+1},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( P_X = (-1)^l \\cdot (-1) \\) accounts for the intrinsic parity of \\( X \\). For parity conservation, \\( P_{\\text{final}} = 1 \\), which implies:\n\n\\[\n(-1)^{L_{\\text{final}} + l + 1} = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad L_{\\text{final}} + l + 1 \\, \\text{is even} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad L_{\\text{final}} + l \\, \\text{is odd}.\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, the Pauli condition requires:\n\n\\[\nT(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2),\n\\]\n\nand since \\( T(NN) = 0 \\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nS(NN) + L(NN) \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2).\n\\]\n\nWe now analyze each option:\n\n### Option A: \\( 1S_0 \\to 7D_1 + p \\)\n- Final NN state: \\( 7D_1 \\), so \\( S = 3 \\) (from \\( 2S+1 = 7 \\)), \\( L = 2 \\) (from \\( D \\)).\n- Pauli condition: \\( S + L = 3 + 2 = 5 \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 2) \\), which is satisfied.\n- Emitted particle \\( X \\): \\( p \\), so \\( l = 1 \\).\n- Parity check: \\( L_{\\text{final}} + l = 2 + 1 = 3 \\), which is odd.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics are involved, and there's this equation: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0, and I need to find which partial wave is not permitted.\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0. So let's parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), right? So 1S0 means 2S+1 =1 \u2192 S=0. L is S, which is 0. So J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nThe system emits a particle X. So the initial NN state is 1S0, and after emission, the NN state becomes something else, and X is emitted. The options give the final NN state as something like 7D1, etc., and the emitted particle's state.\n\nWait, the options are about the final NN state and the emitted particle. So for each option, the initial state is 1S0 (NN) \u2192 final NN state (like 7D1) and a particle X (like p, which is a proton, I think).\n\nWait, but the question is about the partial wave of X. So each option has a lowercase letter like p, s, etc., which probably denotes the angular momentum state of X.\n\nWait, the problem statement says the options are about the angular momentum state of X, right? Because the options are written as 'emits p', 'emits s', etc. Or perhaps the letter denotes the orbital angular momentum quantum number l of X? Because p is l=1, s is l=0, d is l=2, f is l=3.\n\nSo, each option is the initial state (1S0) \u2192 final NN state (like 7D1) plus the emitted X's angular momentum state (like p \u2192 l=1).\n\nWe need to determine which partial wave (i.e., which l for X) is not allowed, considering angular momentum and parity conservation.\n\nAlso, the Pauli statistics condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since the final T(NN) is 0, let's figure out the other quantum numbers.\n\nWait, the Pauli condition given is T(NN) = S + L +1 mod 2. So T = (S + L +1) mod 2.\n\nSince the final state has T=0, then 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parities. So if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but what are S and L for the final NN state? The options give the final state as, for example, 7D1. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 7D1 \u2192 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3. L is D, which is l=2. So S=3, L=2.\n\nWait, but wait, for the NN state, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), where S is the spin, L is orbital angular momentum, and J is the total angular momentum (which is S + L, but in any case, given the term symbol). So for the final state, S and L are the spin and orbital angular momentum of the NN pair.\n\nSo for option A: 7D1 \u2192 S=3, L=2.\n\nSo in this case, S=3 (odd), L=2 (even). S + L = 5 \u2192 odd. 5 mod 2 is 1. So 3 + 2 =5, which is 1 mod 2. So 3 + 2 +1 =6 \u2192 0 mod 2. So T=0, which matches the condition. So for option A, the Pauli condition is satisfied.\n\nBut wait, the Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So in option A, S=3, L=2 \u2192 3+2+1=6 \u2192 0 mod 2 \u2192 T=0. So yes, condition is met.\n\nNow, we need to consider angular momentum and parity conservation. The initial state has certain quantum numbers, and the final state must match.\n\nThe initial NN state is 1S0. So S_initial =0, L_initial=0, J_initial=0.\n\nAfter emitting X, the NN state is in some state with S_final, L_final, and J_final. The X has its own angular momentum l and spin, but I think in this problem, the spin of X might not matter because the question is about the parity and angular momentum.\n\nWait, but parity is a big factor. The parity of the initial state is important, and the parity of the final state must match when considering the emitted particle's parity.\n\nThe initial parity is the parity of the 1S0 state. For a two-body system, the parity is (-1)^L. Since L=0 (S state), the parity is (+1).\n\nWhen a particle is emitted, the parity of the system must change by the parity of the emitted particle. Because parity is multiplicative: the initial parity (P_initial) equals the final parity (P_final) multiplied by the parity of X (P_X). So,\n\nP_initial = P_final * P_X.\n\nWait, no, wait. The parity of the system is the product of the parity of the final state and the parity of the emitted particle, but considering their orbital angular momentum. Hmm, no, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nIn general, when a particle is emitted, the total parity is the product of the parity of the initial state, the parity of the emitted particle, and (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, perhaps the process is that the initial parity is equal to the final state parity multiplied by the parity of the emitted particle, considering their orbital angular momenta.\n\nWait, more accurately, the initial parity is the product of the parity of the final state and the parity of the emitted particle, each raised to the power of (L +1), or something like that. Hmm, maybe I should recall the formula.\n\nThe parity of a two-body system plus a third particle is the product of the parity of the two-body state and the parity of the third particle, each multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So,\n\nP_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^L_X.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The parity of the initial system (before emission) is the product of the parity of the final state (NN) and the parity of the emitted particle X, multiplied by (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of X.\n\nSo,\n\nP_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^l_X.\n\nBecause when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle affects the parity.\n\nIn our case, the initial state is 1S0. So the initial parity is (+1) because L=0.\n\nThe emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So P_X = -1.\n\nSo,\n\n1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X.\n\nWait, let me write that as:\n\n1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X.\n\nSo,\n\nP_final = [ (-1) * (-1)^l_X ]^{-1} * 1.\n\nWait, no, solving for P_final:\n\nP_final = [1] / [ (-1) * (-1)^l_X ].\n\nWait, no, because 1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X.\n\nSo,\n\nP_final = 1 / [ (-1) * (-1)^l_X ].\n\nBut since parity is either +1 or -1, let's write this as:\n\nP_final = (-1)^{-(l_X +1)}.\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nP_final = (-1)^{l_X +1}.\n\nBecause 1/(-1)^a = (-1)^-a = (-1)^a if a is even or odd, but perhaps I should compute it differently.\n\nWait, 1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X \u2192 P_final = [1] / [ (-1) * (-1)^l_X ].\n\nWhich is 1 / [ (-1)^{l_X + 1} ].\n\nWhich is equal to (-1)^{-(l_X + 1)} } \u2192 because 1/(a^b) = a^{-b}.\n\nSo,\n\nP_final = (-1)^{ - (l_X + 1) } = (-1)^{ l_X +1 }.\n\nBecause (-1)^{-n} = (-1)^n, since (-1)^n is \u00b11 and inverting it doesn't change the value.\n\nWait, yes, because (-1)^{-n} = [ (-1)^n ]^{-1} = [ \u00b11 ]^{-1} = \u00b11 again. So,\n\nP_final = (-1)^{ l_X +1 }.\n\nBut the parity of the final NN state can be determined from its term symbol.\n\nThe parity of the final state is given by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN state.\n\nSo, for the final state, P_final = (-1)^L_final.\n\nSo,\n\n(-1)^L_final = (-1)^{ l_X +1 }.\n\nWhich implies that L_final \u2261 l_X +1 mod 2.\n\nBecause for the exponents to be equal mod 2.\n\nSo,\n\nL_final = l_X +1 mod 2.\n\nSo, L_final and l_X must have opposite parity. So if l_X is even, L_final is odd, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's look at each option and see if this condition is satisfied.\n\nAlso, the angular momentum must be conserved. The initial angular momentum is J_initial =0.\n\nThe final NN state has J_final, and the emitted X has angular momentum l_X. So,\n\nJ_initial = J_final + l_X.\n\nBut J_initial is 0, so J_final must equal l_X, and the orbital angular momentum of X must be such that l_X = J_final.\n\nWait, but wait, J is the total angular momentum, which is the sum of orbital angular momentum (L) and spin (S), but for the emitted particle X, I think we're only considering its orbital angular momentum (l) because the problem refers to the lowercase letter as the angular momentum state of X. So perhaps the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l, and the NN system has orbital angular momentum L_final. So the total angular momentum must be conserved. So,\n\nJ_initial = J_final (of NN) + l_X.\n\nBut J_initial is 0, so J_final + l_X must equal 0. But since J and l are non-negative integers, the only way is J_final = l_X = 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the options, the emitted particles have different l's. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial state's angular momentum is 0. After emission, the NN system has J_final and the emitted X has angular momentum l (orbital) plus its spin. But for this problem, perhaps we're only considering the orbital angular momentum, as the spin might be accounted for in the Pauli condition.\n\nWait, maybe the total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial J is 0, so the sum of the final J of NN and the spin (or orbital) angular momentum of X must equal 0. But that's not possible unless both are 0. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of NN is L_final. So, initial orbital angular momentum is 0 (since L_initial=0). So,\n\nL_initial = L_final + l_X.\n\nBut L_initial is 0, so L_final = -l_X. But L and l are non-negative, so the only possibility is l_X =0 and L_final=0.\n\nBut that's not the case in the options, because the emitted X has different l's. So I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum isn't the only thing. The total angular momentum includes the spin of the emitted particle. So maybe the spin of X contributes as well. But the problem states that the partial wave is denoted by the lowercase letter, which I think refers to orbital angular momentum. So perhaps the orbital angular momentum l of X is what we're considering.\n\nWait, perhaps the total angular momentum J is the sum of L (orbital) and S (spin) of the system. But in this case, the problem seems to focus on the orbital angular momentum. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by considering that the initial angular momentum is 0. So the sum of the final NN's angular momentum and the emitted X's angular momentum must be 0. But since they're vectors, their sum must be zero.\n\nSo, if the final NN has angular momentum J_final, and the X has angular momentum l_X, then J_final = l_X.\n\nBecause 0 = J_final + l_X (vectorially), which would require J_final = l_X, but only possible if both are zero. But that's not the case in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the orbital angular momentum only. So initial orbital angular momentum is 0 (from the 1S0 state). After emission, the NN system has orbital angular momentum L_final, and X has orbital angular momentum l_X. So,\n\nL_initial = L_final + l_X.\n\nBut L_initial is 0, so L_final = - l_X. But L_final and l_X are non-negative, so the only possibility is L_final = l_X = 0. But the options have l_X as p (l=1), s (l=0), etc.\n\nSo that can't be right. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Maybe I should think about the angular momentum in terms of possible transitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach the problem by considering each option.\n\nEach option gives the emitted X as a certain angular momentum state (e.g., p is l=1, s is l=0, etc.), and the final NN state.\n\nFor each option, I'll check two conditions:\n\n1. Does the parity condition hold? That is, does (-1)^L_final = (-1)^{l_X +1} ?\n\n2. Does the Pauli condition hold? T_final = (S_final + L_final +1) mod 2 = 0.\n\nSo let's process each option.\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nFinal NN state: 7D1 \u2192 (2S+1)=7 \u2192 S=3. L is D \u2192 2.\n\nSo S_final=3, L_final=2.\n\nParity condition:\n\nP_final = (-1)^L_final = (-1)^2 = 1.\n\nP_X = -1.\n\nSo initial parity is 1.\n\nEquation: 1 = P_final * P_X * (-1)^l_X.\n\nSo,\n\n1 = 1 * (-1) * (-1)^l_X.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 = (-1) * (-1)^l_X \u2192 1 = (-1)^(l_X +1).\n\nWhich implies (-1)^(l_X +1) = 1 \u2192 l_X +1 must be even \u2192 l_X is odd.\n\nSince l_X is the orbital angular momentum of X, which is 'p' \u2192 l=1 (odd). So yes, condition holds.\n\nNow, Pauli condition:\n\nT_final = (S_final + L_final +1) mod 2.\n\nS=3, L=2 \u2192 3 + 2 +1 =6 \u2192 6 mod 2 is 0. So T=0, which matches the given condition. So this option is allowed.\n\nSo option A is allowed.\n\nOption B: 1S0 \u21923S1 + p.\n\nFinal NN state:3S1 \u2192 (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L is S \u2192 0.\n\nSo S_final=1, L_final=0.\n\nParity condition:\n\nP_final = (-1)^0 =1.\n\nP_X=-1.\n\nEquation: 1 = 1 * (-1) * (-1)^l_X \u2192 1 = (-1)*(-1)^l_X \u2192 1 = (-1)^(l_X +1).\n\nSo (-1)^(l_X+1) =1 \u2192 l_X+1 even \u2192 l_X is odd.\n\nX is p \u2192 l=1 (odd). So condition holds.\n\nPauli condition:\n\nS=1, L=0 \u2192 1+0 +1=2 \u2192 mod 2 is 0. So T=0, condition holds. So option B is allowed.\n\nOption C:1S0 \u21923D3 + f.\n\nWait, the final NN state is 3D3. So (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L is D \u2192 2.\n\nSo S=1, L=2.\n\nParity condition:\n\nP_final = (-1)^2 =1.\n\nEquation: 1 = 1 * (-1) * (-1)^l_X \u2192 same as option A.\n\nSo,\n\n1 = (-1) * (-1)^l_X \u2192 1 = (-1)^(l_X+1).\n\nWhich requires l_X+1 even \u2192 l_X is odd.\n\nX is f \u2192 l=3 (odd). So condition holds.\n\nPauli condition:\n\nS=1, L=2 \u2192 1+2 +1=4 \u2192 mod 2 is 0. So T=0, condition holds. So option C is allowed.\n\nOption D:1S0 \u21923P0 + s.\n\nFinal NN state:3P0.\n\n(2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L is P \u21921.\n\nSo S=1, L=1.\n\nParity condition:\n\nP_final = (-1)^1 = -1.\n\nEquation: 1 = (-1) * (-1)^l_X * (-1).\n\nWait, let me recompute.\n\nWait, the equation is:\n\nP_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^l_X.\n\nP_initial is 1 (from 1S0).\n\nSo,\n\n1 = (-1) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X.\n\nBecause P_final is (-1)^1 = -1, and P_X is -1.\n\nSo,\n\n1 = (-1) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X \u2192 1 = (1) * (-1)^l_X.\n\nSo,\n\n(-1)^l_X = 1 \u2192 l_X even.\n\nX is 's' \u2192 l=0 (even). So condition holds.\n\nNow, Pauli condition:\n\nS=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1 +1=3 \u2192 3 mod 2 is 1. So T=1, but the problem states that the final T is 0. So this condition is not met.\n\nSo for option D, the Pauli condition is not satisfied. Therefore, this partial wave is not permitted.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the Pauli condition.\n\nThe Pauli condition says T = S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nIn option D, S=1, L=1 \u2192 1 +1 +1 =3 \u2192 mod 2 is 1. So T=1, which contradicts the given T=0. So option D is not allowed.\n\nSo the correct answer is option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics are involved, and there's this equation: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0, and I need to find which partial wave is not permitted.\n\nWait, the initial state is 1S0. So let's parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), right? So 1S0 means 2S+1 =1 \u2192 S=0. L is S, which is 0. So J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nThe system emits a particle X. So the initial NN state is 1S0, and after emission, the NN state becomes something else, and X is emitted. The options give the final NN state as something like 7D1, etc., and the emitted particle's state.\n\nWait, the options are about the final NN state and the emitted particle. So for each option, the initial state is 1S0 (NN) \u2192 final NN state (like 7D1) and a particle X (like p, which is a proton, I think).\n\nWait, but the question is about the partial wave of X. So each option has a lowercase letter like p, s, etc., which probably denotes the angular momentum state of X.\n\nWait, the problem statement says the options are about the angular momentum state of X, right? Because the options are written as 'emits p', 'emits s', etc. Or perhaps the letter denotes the orbital angular momentum quantum number l of X? Because p is l=1, s is l=0, d is l=2, f is l=3.\n\nSo, each option is the initial state (1S0) \u2192 final NN state (like 7D1) plus the emitted X's angular momentum state (like p \u2192 l=1).\n\nWe need to determine which partial wave (i.e., which l for X) is not allowed, considering angular momentum and parity conservation.\n\nAlso, the Pauli statistics condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since the final T(NN) is 0, let's figure out the other quantum numbers.\n\nWait, the Pauli condition given is T(NN) = S + L +1 mod 2. So T = (S + L +1) mod 2.\n\nSince the final state has T=0, then 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parities. So if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but what are S and L for the final NN state? The options give the final state as, for example, 7D1. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 7D1 \u2192 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3. L is D, which is l=2. So S=3, L=2.\n\nWait, but wait, for the NN state, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), where S is the spin, L is orbital angular momentum, and J is the total angular momentum (which is S + L, but in any case, given the term symbol). So for the final state, S and L are the spin and orbital angular momentum of the NN pair.\n\nSo for option A: 7D1 \u2192 S=3, L=2.\n\nSo in this case, S=3 (odd), L=2 (even). S + L = 5 \u2192 odd. 5 mod 2 is 1. So 3 + 2 =5, which is 1 mod 2. So 3 + 2 +1 =6 \u2192 0 mod 2. So T=0, which matches the condition. So for option A, the Pauli condition is satisfied.\n\nBut wait, the Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So in option A, S=3, L=2 \u2192 3+2+1=6 \u2192 0 mod 2 \u2192 T=0. So yes, condition is met.\n\nNow, we need to consider angular momentum and parity conservation. The initial state has certain quantum numbers, and the final state must match.\n\nThe initial NN state is 1S0. So S_initial =0, L_initial=0, J_initial=0.\n\nAfter emitting X, the NN state is in some state with S_final, L_final, and J_final. The X has its own angular momentum l and spin, but I think in this problem, the spin of X might not matter because the question is about the parity and angular momentum.\n\nWait, but parity is a big factor. The parity of the initial state is important, and the parity of the final state must match when considering the emitted particle's parity.\n\nThe initial parity is the parity of the 1S0 state. For a two-body system, the parity is (-1)^L. Since L=0 (S state), the parity is (+1).\n\nWhen a particle is emitted, the parity of the system must change by the parity of the emitted particle. Because parity is multiplicative: the initial parity (P_initial) equals the final parity (P_final) multiplied by the parity of X (P_X). So,\n\nP_initial = P_final * P_X.\n\nWait, no, wait. The parity of the system is the product of the parity of the final state and the parity of the emitted particle, but considering their orbital angular momentum. Hmm, no, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nIn general, when a particle is emitted, the total parity is the product of the parity of the initial state, the parity of the emitted particle, and (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, perhaps the process is that the initial parity is equal to the final state parity multiplied by the parity of the emitted particle, considering their orbital angular momenta.\n\nWait, more accurately, the initial parity is the product of the parity of the final state and the parity of the emitted particle, each raised to the power of (L +1), or something like that. Hmm, maybe I should recall the formula.\n\nThe parity of a two-body system plus a third particle is the product of the parity of the two-body state and the parity of the third particle, each multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So,\n\nP_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^L_X.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The parity of the initial system (before emission) is the product of the parity of the final state (NN) and the parity of the emitted particle X, multiplied by (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of X.\n\nSo,\n\nP_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^l_X.\n\nBecause when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle affects the parity.\n\nIn our case, the initial state is 1S0. So the initial parity is (+1) because L=0.\n\nThe emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So P_X = -1.\n\nSo,\n\n1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X.\n\nWait, let me write that as:\n\n1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X.\n\nSo,\n\nP_final = [ (-1) * (-1)^l_X ]^{-1} * 1.\n\nWait, no, solving for P_final:\n\nP_final = [1] / [ (-1) * (-1)^l_X ].\n\nWait, no, because 1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X.\n\nSo,\n\nP_final = 1 / [ (-1) * (-1)^l_X ].\n\nBut since parity is either +1 or -1, let's write this as:\n\nP_final = (-1)^{-(l_X +1)}.\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nP_final = (-1)^{l_X +1}.\n\nBecause 1/(-1)^a = (-1)^-a = (-1)^a if a is even or odd, but perhaps I should compute it differently.\n\nWait, 1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X \u2192 P_final = [1] / [ (-1) * (-1)^l_X ].\n\nWhich is 1 / [ (-1)^{l_X + 1} ].\n\nWhich is equal to (-1)^{-(l_X + 1)} } \u2192 because 1/(a^b) = a^{-b}.\n\nSo,\n\nP_final = (-1)^{ - (l_X + 1) } = (-1)^{ l_X +1 }.\n\nBecause (-1)^{-n} = (-1)^n, since (-1)^n is \u00b11 and inverting it doesn't change the value.\n\nWait, yes, because (-1)^{-n} = [ (-1)^n ]^{-1} = [ \u00b11 ]^{-1} = \u00b11 again. So,\n\nP_final = (-1)^{ l_X +1 }.\n\nBut the parity of the final NN state can be determined from its term symbol.\n\nThe parity of the final state is given by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN state.\n\nSo, for the final state, P_final = (-1)^L_final.\n\nSo,\n\n(-1)^L_final = (-1)^{ l_X +1 }.\n\nWhich implies that L_final \u2261 l_X +1 mod 2.\n\nBecause for the exponents to be equal mod 2.\n\nSo,\n\nL_final = l_X +1 mod 2.\n\nSo, L_final and l_X must have opposite parity. So if l_X is even, L_final is odd, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's look at each option and see if this condition is satisfied.\n\nAlso, the angular momentum must be conserved. The initial angular momentum is J_initial =0.\n\nThe final NN state has J_final, and the emitted X has angular momentum l_X. So,\n\nJ_initial = J_final + l_X.\n\nBut J_initial is 0, so J_final must equal l_X, and the orbital angular momentum of X must be such that l_X = J_final.\n\nWait, but wait, J is the total angular momentum, which is the sum of orbital angular momentum (L) and spin (S), but for the emitted particle X, I think we're only considering its orbital angular momentum (l) because the problem refers to the lowercase letter as the angular momentum state of X. So perhaps the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l, and the NN system has orbital angular momentum L_final. So the total angular momentum must be conserved. So,\n\nJ_initial = J_final (of NN) + l_X.\n\nBut J_initial is 0, so J_final + l_X must equal 0. But since J and l are non-negative integers, the only way is J_final = l_X = 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the options, the emitted particles have different l's. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial state's angular momentum is 0. After emission, the NN system has J_final and the emitted X has angular momentum l (orbital) plus its spin. But for this problem, perhaps we're only considering the orbital angular momentum, as the spin might be accounted for in the Pauli condition.\n\nWait, maybe the total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial J is 0, so the sum of the final J of NN and the spin (or orbital) angular momentum of X must equal 0. But that's not possible unless both are 0. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of NN is L_final. So, initial orbital angular momentum is 0 (since L_initial=0). So,\n\nL_initial = L_final + l_X.\n\nBut L_initial is 0, so L_final = -l_X. But L and l are non-negative, so the only possibility is l_X =0 and L_final=0.\n\nBut that's not the case in the options, because the emitted X has different l's. So I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum isn't the only thing. The total angular momentum includes the spin of the emitted particle. So maybe the spin of X contributes as well. But the problem states that the partial wave is denoted by the lowercase letter, which I think refers to orbital angular momentum. So perhaps the orbital angular momentum l of X is what we're considering.\n\nWait, perhaps the total angular momentum J is the sum of L (orbital) and S (spin) of the system. But in this case, the problem seems to focus on the orbital angular momentum. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by considering that the initial angular momentum is 0. So the sum of the final NN's angular momentum and the emitted X's angular momentum must be 0. But since they're vectors, their sum must be zero.\n\nSo, if the final NN has angular momentum J_final, and the X has angular momentum l_X, then J_final = l_X.\n\nBecause 0 = J_final + l_X (vectorially), which would require J_final = l_X, but only possible if both are zero. But that's not the case in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the orbital angular momentum only. So initial orbital angular momentum is 0 (from the 1S0 state). After emission, the NN system has orbital angular momentum L_final, and X has orbital angular momentum l_X. So,\n\nL_initial = L_final + l_X.\n\nBut L_initial is 0, so L_final = - l_X. But L_final and l_X are non-negative, so the only possibility is L_final = l_X = 0. But the options have l_X as p (l=1), s (l=0), etc.\n\nSo that can't be right. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Maybe I should think about the angular momentum in terms of possible transitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach the problem by considering each option.\n\nEach option gives the emitted X as a certain angular momentum state (e.g., p is l=1, s is l=0, etc.), and the final NN state.\n\nFor each option, I'll check two conditions:\n\n1. Does the parity condition hold? That is, does (-1)^L_final = (-1)^{l_X +1} ?\n\n2. Does the Pauli condition hold? T_final = (S_final + L_final +1) mod 2 = 0.\n\nSo let's process each option.\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nFinal NN state: 7D1 \u2192 (2S+1)=7 \u2192 S=3. L is D \u2192 2.\n\nSo S_final=3, L_final=2.\n\nParity condition:\n\nP_final = (-1)^L_final = (-1)^2 = 1.\n\nP_X = -1.\n\nSo initial parity is 1.\n\nEquation: 1 = P_final * P_X * (-1)^l_X.\n\nSo,\n\n1 = 1 * (-1) * (-1)^l_X.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 = (-1) * (-1)^l_X \u2192 1 = (-1)^(l_X +1).\n\nWhich implies (-1)^(l_X +1) = 1 \u2192 l_X +1 must be even \u2192 l_X is odd.\n\nSince l_X is the orbital angular momentum of X, which is 'p' \u2192 l=1 (odd). So yes, condition holds.\n\nNow, Pauli condition:\n\nT_final = (S_final + L_final +1) mod 2.\n\nS=3, L=2 \u2192 3 + 2 +1 =6 \u2192 6 mod 2 is 0. So T=0, which matches the given condition. So this option is allowed.\n\nSo option A is allowed.\n\nOption B: 1S0 \u21923S1 + p.\n\nFinal NN state:3S1 \u2192 (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L is S \u2192 0.\n\nSo S_final=1, L_final=0.\n\nParity condition:\n\nP_final = (-1)^0 =1.\n\nP_X=-1.\n\nEquation: 1 = 1 * (-1) * (-1)^l_X \u2192 1 = (-1)*(-1)^l_X \u2192 1 = (-1)^(l_X +1).\n\nSo (-1)^(l_X+1) =1 \u2192 l_X+1 even \u2192 l_X is odd.\n\nX is p \u2192 l=1 (odd). So condition holds.\n\nPauli condition:\n\nS=1, L=0 \u2192 1+0 +1=2 \u2192 mod 2 is 0. So T=0, condition holds. So option B is allowed.\n\nOption C:1S0 \u21923D3 + f.\n\nWait, the final NN state is 3D3. So (2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L is D \u2192 2.\n\nSo S=1, L=2.\n\nParity condition:\n\nP_final = (-1)^2 =1.\n\nEquation: 1 = 1 * (-1) * (-1)^l_X \u2192 same as option A.\n\nSo,\n\n1 = (-1) * (-1)^l_X \u2192 1 = (-1)^(l_X+1).\n\nWhich requires l_X+1 even \u2192 l_X is odd.\n\nX is f \u2192 l=3 (odd). So condition holds.\n\nPauli condition:\n\nS=1, L=2 \u2192 1+2 +1=4 \u2192 mod 2 is 0. So T=0, condition holds. So option C is allowed.\n\nOption D:1S0 \u21923P0 + s.\n\nFinal NN state:3P0.\n\n(2S+1)=3 \u2192 S=1. L is P \u21921.\n\nSo S=1, L=1.\n\nParity condition:\n\nP_final = (-1)^1 = -1.\n\nEquation: 1 = (-1) * (-1)^l_X * (-1).\n\nWait, let me recompute.\n\nWait, the equation is:\n\nP_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^l_X.\n\nP_initial is 1 (from 1S0).\n\nSo,\n\n1 = (-1) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X.\n\nBecause P_final is (-1)^1 = -1, and P_X is -1.\n\nSo,\n\n1 = (-1) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X \u2192 1 = (1) * (-1)^l_X.\n\nSo,\n\n(-1)^l_X = 1 \u2192 l_X even.\n\nX is 's' \u2192 l=0 (even). So condition holds.\n\nNow, Pauli condition:\n\nS=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1 +1=3 \u2192 3 mod 2 is 1. So T=1, but the problem states that the final T is 0. So this condition is not met.\n\nSo for option D, the Pauli condition is not satisfied. Therefore, this partial wave is not permitted.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the Pauli condition.\n\nThe Pauli condition says T = S + L +1 mod 2.\n\nIn option D, S=1, L=1 \u2192 1 +1 +1 =3 \u2192 mod 2 is 1. So T=1, which contradicts the given T=0. So option D is not allowed.\n\nSo the correct answer is option D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The initial NN state is in the 1S0 configuration. This implies:\n   - Total spin \\( S = 0 \\),\n   - Orbital angular momentum \\( L = 0 \\),\n   - Total angular momentum \\( J = 0 \\),\n   - Parity \\( P_{\\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = (+1) \\).\n\n2. **Emission of Particle X**: The emitted particle \\( X \\) has intrinsic parity \\( P_X = -1 \\). The parity of the final state must satisfy:\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{initial}} = P_{\\text{final}} \\cdot P_X \\cdot (-1)^{l_X},\n   \\]\n   where \\( l_X \\) is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of \\( X \\). Substituting \\( P_{\\text{initial}} = 1 \\) and \\( P_X = -1 \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   1 = P_{\\text{final}} \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1)^{l_X}.\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, \\( P_{\\text{final}} = (-1)^{l_X + 1} \\). Since the parity of the final NN state is \\( P_{\\text{final}} = (-1)^{L_{\\text{final}}} \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   (-1)^{L_{\\text{final}}} = (-1)^{l_X + 1}.\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   L_{\\text{final}} \\equiv l_X + 1 \\pmod{2}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Pauli Condition**: The isospin \\( T_{\\text{final}} \\) of the NN state must satisfy:\n   \\[\n   T_{\\text{final}} = S_{\\text{final}} + L_{\\text{final}} + 1 \\pmod{2}.\n   \\]\n   For the final state, \\( T_{\\text{final}} = 0 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   S_{\\text{final}} + L_{\\text{final}} + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}.\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   S_{\\text{final}} + L_{\\text{final}} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \\( 1S0 \\to 7D1 + p \\)\n     - Final NN state: \\( 7D1 \\) implies \\( S_{\\text{final}} = 3 \\), \\( L_{\\text{final}} = 2 \\).\n     - Parity condition: \\( (-1)^{L_{\\text{final}}} = (-1)^2 = 1 \\), and \\( (-1)^{l_X + 1} = (-1)^{1 + 1} = 1 \\). Condition satisfied.\n     - Pauli condition: \\( S_{\\text{final}} + L_{\\text{final}} = 3 + 2 = 5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\). Condition satisfied.\n     - **Allowed**.\n\n   - **Option B**: \\( 1S0 \\to 3S1 + p \\)\n     - Final NN state: \\( 3S1 \\) implies \\( S_{\\text{final}} = 1 \\), \\( L_{\\text{final}} = 0 \\).\n     - Parity condition: \\( (-1)^{L_{\\text{final}}} = (-1)^0 = 1 \\), and \\( (-1)^{l_X + 1} = (-1)^{1 + 1} = 1 \\). Condition satisfied.\n     - Pauli condition: \\( S_{\\text{final}} + L_{\\text{final}} = 1 + 0 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\). Condition satisfied.\n     - **Allowed**.\n\n   - **Option C**: \\( 1S0 \\to 3D3 + f \\)\n     - Final NN state: \\( 3D3 \\) implies \\( S_{\\text{final}} = 1 \\), \\( L_{\\text{final}} = 2 \\).\n     - Parity condition: \\( (-1)^{L_{\\text{final}}} = (-1)^2 = 1 \\), and \\( (-1)^{l_X + 1} = (-1)^{3 + 1} = 1 \\). Condition satisfied.\n     - Pauli condition: \\( S_{\\text{final}} + L_{\\text{final}} = 1 + 2 = 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\). Condition satisfied.\n     - **Allowed**.\n\n   - **Option D**: \\( 1S0 \\to 3P0 + s \\)\n     - Final NN state: \\( 3P0 \\) implies \\( S_{\\text{final}} = 1 \\), \\( L_{\\text{final}} = 1 \\).\n     - Parity condition: \\( (-1)^{L_{\\text{final}}} = (-1)^1 = -1 \\), and \\( (-1)^{l_X + 1} = (-1)^{0 + 1} = -1 \\). Condition satisfied.\n     - Pauli condition: \\( S_{\\text{final}} + L_{\\text{final}} = 1 + 1 = 2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2} \\). This contradicts \\( T_{\\text{final}} = 0 \\), as \\( S_{\\text{final}} + L_{\\text{final}} + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\). Condition **not satisfied**.\n     - **Not Allowed**.\n\n**Conclusion**: The partial wave not permitted is **Option D**.\n\nAnswer: D",
