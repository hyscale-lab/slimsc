      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a vector in three dimensions. So it's a 3x1 column vector. Let me note that down: the state vector is [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually unit vectors. Do I need to normalize this? Hmm, maybe. Let me check the length. The square of the magnitude is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector would be 1/sqrt(6) multiplied by each component. Oh, right, because state vectors must be normalized. So the actual vector is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nNext, the problem introduces two observables, P and Q. Their matrix representations are given. I need to find the probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.\n\nSo the process is: first measure P, then measure Q. But wait, the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in their respective measurements. So it's the joint probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.\n\nWait, but after measuring P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, when measuring Q on this new state, the probability of getting -1 is calculated. So the overall probability is the product of the probability of P being 0 and, given that, Q being -1.\n\nBut wait, I think I should approach it more carefully. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. Because when we measure P, the system collapses into an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0.\n\n2. Project the initial state onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. The norm of this projection gives the probability of getting P=0.\n\n3. Once the state is projected, it's now in an eigenstate of P (or a superposition if degenerate). Then, we measure Q on this new state and find the probability of getting eigenvalue -1.\n\nWait, but actually, if the eigenspace for P=0 is more than one-dimensional, the projection would be a subspace. But in that case, the state after measurement would be in that subspace, and then we'd have to find the probability of measuring Q=-1 in that subspace. But let me first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n\nThe operator P is given by a 3x3 matrix:\n\nFirst row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.\n\nSecond row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).\n\nThird row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.\n\nHmm. Let me write that out:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nI need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. To find the eigenvalues, I have to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nLet me compute the determinant of (P - \u03bb I):\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2    -\u03bb      1/\u221a2    |\n|0      1/\u221a2     -\u03bb      |\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\nRow 1: -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb\n\nLet me compute the determinant.\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be found using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's expand along the first row.\n\ndet = -\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] ) - (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] ) + 0 * something.\n\nSo, compute each minor.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] = -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2)).\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb / \u221a2) ) ] = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb / \u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nLet me factor this:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nWait, expanding:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb(1/2 + 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 ) =0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2) = 0.\n\nThus, eigenvalues \u03bb = 0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, so for P=0, the eigenspace is one-dimensional? Or is it more? Let me check the eigenvectors.\n\nFor \u03bb=0:\n\nWe solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v =0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 +0 v3 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow 2: (1/\u221a2)v1 +0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nRow3: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 +0*v3=0 \u2192 same as row1, v2=0.\n\nSo from row1 and row3, v2=0. From row2, v1 = -v3.\n\nThus, the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. So let's let v3 = t, then v1 = -t.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [-t, 0, t]^T = t * [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector [-1; 0; 1].\n\nWait, but wait, no, wait. Wait, let me recheck. When I have v1 = -v3 and v2=0. So the vector can be written as v = [ -v3; 0; v3 ] = v3 * [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nSo any scalar multiple of [ -1; 0; 1 ] is in the eigenspace for \u03bb=0.\n\nSo the eigenspace is one-dimensional.\n\nSo the projection of the initial state onto this eigenspace will give the state after measuring P=0. The probability is the square of the norm of this projection.\n\nWait, but before that, let me compute the initial state vector. As I thought earlier, it's [ -1; 2; 1 ] divided by sqrt(6) to normalize.\n\nSo the initial state is \u03c8_initial = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nNow, the eigenvector for P=0 is v_p0 = [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, but normalized. Let me compute its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 +0^2 +1^2 = 2 \u2192 norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nWait, but when I project \u03c8_initial onto this eigenvector, the projection is (\u03c8_initial \u22c5 v_p0_normalized) * v_p0_normalized.\n\nAlternatively, the probability is |<v_p0 | \u03c8_initial>|^2.\n\nSo let me compute this inner product.\n\nv_p0_normalized is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\n\u03c8_initial is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) ].\n\nCalculating the terms: (1)(1) = 1, 0*2=0, 1*1=1 \u2192 sum is 2.\n\nSo inner product = (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) ) * 2 = (2) / (sqrt(12)) ) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Because the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the probability is the square of the component of the state in that direction. So yes, 1/3.\n\nSo if we measure P and get 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector v_p0. So the state after measurement is v_p0_normalized multiplied by sqrt(1/3) because the probability is 1/3. Wait, no: the state after measurement is the projection divided by the probability. Let me think.\n\nThe projection of \u03c8_initial onto v_p0_normalized is (inner product) * v_p0_normalized. The inner product was 1/sqrt(3). So the projection is (1/sqrt(3)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) * [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nWait, no: wait, the inner product was (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) * 2 = 2/(sqrt(12)) )= 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3). So the projection is (1/sqrt(3)) * v_p0_normalized. Because the inner product is <v_p0|\u03c8_initial> = 1/sqrt(3), so the projection is (1/sqrt(3)) * v_p0.\n\nWait, maybe I should just compute it as follows.\n\nThe projection operator onto the eigenspace is |v_p0><v_p0|. So the projected state is |v_p0><v_p0|\u03c8_initial>.\n\nWhich is (v_p0)(v_p0\u2020 \u03c8_initial).\n\nv_p0\u2020 \u03c8_initial is the inner product, which is 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the projected state is (1/sqrt(3)) * v_p0.\n\nSo the state after measurement is (1/sqrt(3)) * v_p0.\n\nBut wait, v_p0 is the normalized eigenvector, so it's (1/sqrt(2)) [-1, 0, 1]^T. So the projected state is (1/sqrt(3)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nSo now, we have to measure Q on this state. The operator Q is given by:\n\nQ = [\n[1, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, -1]\n]\n\nSo Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1.\n\nEach diagonal element is the eigenvalue, and the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n\nSo, for Q=1, the eigenvector is [1; 0; 0].\n\nFor Q=0, the eigenvector is [0;1;0].\n\nFor Q=-1, the eigenvector is [0;0;1].\n\nSo the state after measuring P=0 is \u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nWe need to compute the probability of measuring Q=-1 when in state \u03c8_p0.\n\nTo find this, we need to find the component of \u03c8_p0 in the Q=-1 eigenspace, which is the vector [0;0;1].\n\nSo the inner product between \u03c8_p0 and [0;0;1] will give the amplitude, and the square of its absolute value is the probability.\n\nSo compute <eigen_Q=-1 | \u03c8_p0>:\n\n= [0, 0, 1] * (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\n= (1/sqrt(6)) (0*(-1) + 0*0 +1*1) = (1/sqrt(6)) (1) = 1/sqrt(6).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(6))^2 = 1/6.\n\nSo the probability of measuring Q=-1 after P=0 is 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait. So the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities? Because the first measurement must result in P=0, and then the second measurement must result in Q=-1.\n\nSo the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18? No, wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 1/18. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait no, no. Wait, the initial probability of P=0 is 1/3. Then, given that, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/6. So the joint probability is 1/3 multiplied by 1/6, which is 1/18. But that's not one of the options. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the projection of the state after measuring P=0. Let me go through it again.\n\nThe state after measuring P=0 is \u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(3)) * v_p0, where v_p0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [-1, 0, 1]^T. So \u03c8_p0 is (1/sqrt(3))*(1/sqrt(2)) * [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nNow, when measuring Q, which has eigenstates [1;0;0], [0;1;0], [0;0;1].\n\nThe state \u03c8_p0 is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1; 0; 1].\n\nSo to find the probability of Q=-1, which corresponds to the eigenstate [0;0;1], the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * [0, 0, 1] \u00b7 [-1, 0, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(6)) * (0*(-1) + 0*0 +1*1) ) = 1/sqrt(6).\n\nThe probability is (1/sqrt(6))^2 = 1/6.\n\nSo the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute it another way. Let's think about the combined measurement. Alternatively, perhaps the way I approached it is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the state after P=0 is not just the projection but normalized. Wait, no, when you measure P and get 0, the state collapses to the projection, which is \u03c8_p0. So perhaps the state is correctly computed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial state's normalization. Let me double-check that.\n\nThe initial state is given as (-1,2,1). Its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 )= sqrt(6), so the state is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,2,1]^T.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for operator P, the eigenvalue 0 has eigenvector [-1,0,1]^T, which when normalized is (1/sqrt(2)) [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nThe inner product between this and the initial state is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1)(-1) +0*2 +1*1 ] = (1/sqrt(12)) (1 + 0 +1 )= (2)/sqrt(12) )= sqrt(12)/6 = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nThen, the state after measurement is \u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(3)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nSo that's (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nNow, when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.\n\nThe state \u03c8_p0 is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nThe projection onto Q=-1 is the component along [0,0,1].\n\nThe inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * 1 = 1/sqrt(6).\n\nProbability is 1/6.\n\nSo the probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1 is 1/3 * 1/6 = 1/18.\n\nBut none of the options are 1/18. The options are A) 1/2, B)1/3, C)2/3, D)1/6.\n\nHmm, so either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvectors. Let me check the eigenvectors of P again.\n\nWait, when I computed the eigenvectors for P with eigenvalue 0, I found that v2=0, and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form (v1,0, v3) = t*(-1,0,1), right?\n\nYes, that's correct. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, as I thought.\n\nSo the projection is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the state after P=0 is \u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(3)) * v_p0. But v_p0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nSo \u03c8_p0 is (1/sqrt(3)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [-1,0,1]^T = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nNow, when measuring Q, which is diagonal, the probability of each outcome is the square of the corresponding component in the state.\n\nBecause Q's eigenstates are the standard basis vectors.\n\nSo the state is \u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nSo the components are:\n\nComponent along [1,0,0]: (1/sqrt(6))*(-1)\n\nComponent along [0,1,0]: (1/sqrt(6))*0=0\n\nComponent along [0,0,1]: (1/sqrt(6))*1\n\nSo the probabilities are the squares of these.\n\nSo for Q=1: ( (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1) )^2 = 1/6.\n\nFor Q=0: 0.\n\nFor Q=-1: (1/sqrt(6))^2 = 1/6.\n\nWait, so the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/6.\n\nSo the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/6) )= 1/18.\n\nBut that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that after measuring P, the state is in the eigenstate of P=0, and then when measuring Q, the probabilities are calculated in that state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way I'm calculating is correct, but I'm missing a step. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the observables P and Q do not commute. So the order of measurements matters. But the question says measure Q just after P, so the state after P is used for Q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvectors of P. Let me recompute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n\nWait, the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0.\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2.\n\nRow3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0.\n\nWe found the eigenvalues to be 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, let me recompute the eigenvalues to be sure.\n\nThe characteristic equation was -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb^2 +1 ) =0 \u2192 \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1. Correct.\n\nNow, for \u03bb=1:\n\nWe solve (P - I) v =0.\n\nMatrix P-I is:\n\nRow 1: -1, 1/\u221a2, 0.\n\nRow 2:1/\u221a2, -1, 1/\u221a2.\n\nRow3:0,1/\u221a2, -1.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\n-1*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 +0 v3 =0 \u2192 equation 1: v1 = (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nRow2: (1/\u221a2) v1 - v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 substituting v1 from equation1: (1/\u221a2)( (1/\u221a2) v2 ) ) - v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 (1/2) v2 - v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 (-1/2) v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 equation 2: (1/\u221a2) v3 = (1/2) v2 \u2192 v3 = (1/2) v2 * sqrt(2) ) = (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nRow3: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 -v3=0 \u2192 equation3: (1/\u221a2) v2 = v3.\n\nFrom equation2 and 3: equation2 says v3 = (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nEquation3 says v3= (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nSo they are consistent.\n\nSo v3= (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nv1 = (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ (1/\u221a2) v2, v2, (1/\u221a2) v2 ]^T.\n\nLet me choose v2=\u221a2, then:\n\nv1= (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2=1,\n\nv2=\u221a2,\n\nv3= (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2=1.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit large. Let me normalize it.\n\nThe norm squared is 1^2 + (sqrt(2))^2 +1^2 = 1+2+1=4. So norm is 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/2) [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T.\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb=-1, the process would be similar, but let's not get into that now.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm not making progress. Let me think about the state after P=0. It's (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nNow, when measuring Q, which is diagonal, the probability of Q=-1 is the square of the third component, right?\n\nBecause Q's eigenstates are the standard basis vectors.\n\nSo the state is:\n\n\u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nThe third component is 1/sqrt(6), so the probability is (1/sqrt(6))^2 =1/6.\n\nSo the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/6.\n\nBut the overall probability of P=0 and then Q=-1 is (1/3) * (1/6) )= 1/18.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the state after measuring P=0 and then find the expectation value of Q, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is not the product but something else. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the two measurements are being considered together. So perhaps the combined probability is the product of the probabilities. But in that case, 1/3 * 1/6 is 1/18, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm. Let me look at the options again. The options are A) 1/2, B)1/3, C)2/3, D)1/6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the probability after P=0. Let me think again.\n\nThe state after P=0 is \u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nTo find the probability of measuring Q=-1, which corresponds to the state [0,0,1], the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * 1 = 1/sqrt(6).\n\nSo the probability is (1/sqrt(6))^2 =1/6.\n\nSo the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/6=1/18. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state after P=0 is not normalized correctly. Wait, no, the state is already normalized because the initial state is normalized, and the projection is into a normalized eigenvector.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the inner product for the probability of P=0.\n\nWait, the initial state is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nThe eigenvector for P=0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nThe inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 +1*1 ] = (1/sqrt(12)) (1 +0 +1 )= 2/sqrt(12) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the measurement of Q is not dependent on the state after P=0. Wait, no, that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the operator Q is diagonal, so in the state \u03c8_p0, the probability of Q=-1 is the square of the third component.\n\nWait, yes, because in the standard basis, each component corresponds to the eigenvalue of Q.\n\nSo in \u03c8_p0, the third component is 1/sqrt(6), so the probability is 1/6.\n\nSo the joint probability is 1/3 *1/6=1/18.\n\nBut that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the eigenspace for P=0 is more than one-dimensional, but earlier calculation shows it's one-dimensional.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues of P.\n\nWait, when I found the eigenvalues, I got 0,1,-1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the determinant calculation.\n\nThe determinant of (P - \u03bb I) is:\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2    -\u03bb      1/\u221a2    |\n|0      1/\u221a2     -\u03bb      |\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0.\n\n= -\u03bb ( \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) - (1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) ].\n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo equation is -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 -1 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb=0, 1, -1. Correct.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are correct.\n\nHmm. I'm not seeing any mistake in the calculations. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be, as the problem must have an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial state's normalization.\n\nWait, the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). Its norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the probabilities differently. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial state is \u03c8 = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nWhen measuring P, the possible outcomes are 1,0,-1. The probabilities are the squares of the projections onto each eigenspace.\n\nWe found that the probability for P=0 is 1/3.\n\nThen, after measuring P=0, the state is \u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(3)) * v_p0, where v_p0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1,0,1 ]^T.\n\nSo \u03c8_p0 is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nNow, to find the probability of Q=-1, we look at the component along [0,0,1].\n\nThe amplitude is (1/sqrt(6)) *1 = 1/sqrt(6). So the probability is 1/6.\n\nSo the joint probability is 1/3 *1/6=1/18.\n\nHmm. Since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvectors.\n\nWait, perhaps the eigenvectors for P are different. Let me try to find them again.\n\nFor P and \u03bb=0:\n\nEquations:\n\nRow1: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow2: (1/\u221a2) v1 +0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3=0 \u2192 v1 + v3=0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nRow3: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 +0*v3=0 \u2192 same as row1, v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvector is v = [v1, 0, v3 ] = [ -v3, 0, v3 ] = v3 [ -1, 0, 1 ].\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo I think I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial state is not normalized. Let me check.\n\nNo, the initial state is given as a column vector (-1,2,1). It's not stated whether it's normalized. So perhaps I should not assume it's normalized.\n\nWait, the problem states, \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\". It doesn't say it's normalized. So perhaps I shouldn't normalize it. That changes everything.\n\nWait, if the state is not normalized, then the probabilities are computed differently.\n\nSo the initial state is \u03c8 = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nThe norm is sqrt(6), but perhaps we don't normalize it. Let me think.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, state vectors are typically unit vectors, but perhaps the problem is just using a vector, not necessarily normalized.\n\nWait, but when you compute probabilities, you have to normalize. So perhaps the state is given as (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1,2,1 ]^T.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state that, so perhaps I shouldn't normalize.\n\nWait, no. Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors must be normalized. So perhaps the problem assumes it's already normalized. But in that case, the given vector is not normalized, so perhaps I should normalize it.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\". So perhaps it's a non-normalized vector. So perhaps the state is \u03c8 = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nIn that case, the probabilities would be calculated differently.\n\nWait, let me recalculate everything without normalization.\n\nThe initial state is \u03c8 = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nThe eigenvectors of P are as before.\n\nThe projection onto the eigenspace for P=0 is (v_p0\u2020) \u03c8, where v_p0 is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nThe inner product is [ -1, 0, 1 ] \u00b7 [ -1, 2, 1 ] = (1)(1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) = 2.\n\nThe norm of v_p0 is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 )= sqrt(2).\n\nSo the projection length is 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).\n\nThe norm of \u03c8 is sqrt(6).\n\nSo the probability is (sqrt(2))^2 / (sqrt(6))^2 = 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nSame as before.\n\nThe state after measurement is (v_p0\u2020 \u03c8) / ||\u03c8||^2 * \u03c8_p0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Alternatively, the state after measurement is \u03c8_p0 = (v_p0 / ||v_p0||) * (v_p0\u2020 \u03c8) / (v_p0\u2020 \u03c8).\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to compute the state after measurement as the projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenspace divided by the probability.\n\nSo the projection is ( (v_p0\u2020 \u03c8) / ||v_p0||^2 ) * v_p0.\n\nWhich is (2/sqrt(2)) * v_p0 / sqrt(6)^2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nThe projection operator onto the eigenspace for P=0 is |v_p0><v_p0|, where v_p0 is the normalized eigenvector.\n\nSo the projected state is |v_p0><v_p0|\u03c8>.\n\nWhich is (v_p0\u2020 \u03c8) v_p0.\n\nSo v_p0 is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T / sqrt(2).\n\n\u03c8 is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nSo v_p0\u2020 \u03c8 = [ -1, 0, 1 ] \u00b7 [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(2) = (1 +0 +1)/sqrt(2) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).\n\nSo the projected state is (sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T = [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nSo the state after measurement is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nBut wait, this isn't normalized. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 )= sqrt(2).\n\nSo to get the normalized state, we divide by sqrt(2), giving [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\nNow, when we measure Q, which is diagonal, the probability of Q=-1 is the square of the third component of the state.\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nThus, the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nAh, that matches option D: 1/6.\n\nSo the correct answer is D) 1/6.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a vector in three dimensions. So it's a 3x1 column vector. Let me note that down: the state vector is [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually unit vectors. Do I need to normalize this? Hmm, maybe. Let me check the length. The square of the magnitude is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector would be 1/sqrt(6) multiplied by each component. Oh, right, because state vectors must be normalized. So the actual vector is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nNext, the problem introduces two observables, P and Q. Their matrix representations are given. I need to find the probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.\n\nSo the process is: first measure P, then measure Q. But wait, the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in their respective measurements. So it's the joint probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.\n\nWait, but after measuring P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, when measuring Q on this new state, the probability of getting -1 is calculated. So the overall probability is the product of the probability of P being 0 and, given that, Q being -1.\n\nBut wait, I think I should approach it more carefully. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. Because when we measure P, the system collapses into an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0.\n\n2. Project the initial state onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. The norm of this projection gives the probability of getting P=0.\n\n3. Once the state is projected, it's now in an eigenstate of P (or a superposition if degenerate). Then, we measure Q on this new state and find the probability of getting eigenvalue -1.\n\nWait, but actually, if the eigenspace for P=0 is more than one-dimensional, the projection would be a subspace. But in that case, the state after measurement would be in that subspace, and then we'd have to find the probability of measuring Q=-1 in that subspace. But let me first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n\nThe operator P is given by a 3x3 matrix:\n\nFirst row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.\n\nSecond row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).\n\nThird row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.\n\nHmm. Let me write that out:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nI need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. To find the eigenvalues, I have to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nLet me compute the determinant of (P - \u03bb I):\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2    -\u03bb      1/\u221a2    |\n|0      1/\u221a2     -\u03bb      |\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\nRow 1: -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb\n\nLet me compute the determinant.\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be found using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's expand along the first row.\n\ndet = -\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] ) - (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] ) + 0 * something.\n\nSo, compute each minor.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] = -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2)).\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb / \u221a2) ) ] = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb / \u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nLet me factor this:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nWait, expanding:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb(1/2 + 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 ) =0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2) = 0.\n\nThus, eigenvalues \u03bb = 0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, so for P=0, the eigenspace is one-dimensional? Or is it more? Let me check the eigenvectors.\n\nFor \u03bb=0:\n\nWe solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v =0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 +0 v3 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow 2: (1/\u221a2)v1 +0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nRow3: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 +0*v3=0 \u2192 same as row1, v2=0.\n\nSo from row1 and row3, v2=0. From row2, v1 = -v3.\n\nThus, the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. So let's let v3 = t, then v1 = -t.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [-t, 0, t]^T = t * [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector [-1; 0; 1].\n\nWait, but wait, no, wait. Wait, let me recheck. When I have v1 = -v3 and v2=0. So the vector can be written as v = [ -v3; 0; v3 ] = v3 * [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nSo any scalar multiple of [ -1; 0; 1 ] is in the eigenspace for \u03bb=0.\n\nSo the eigenspace is one-dimensional.\n\nSo the projection of the initial state onto this eigenspace will give the state after measuring P=0. The probability is the square of the norm of this projection.\n\nWait, but before that, let me compute the initial state vector. As I thought earlier, it's [ -1; 2; 1 ] divided by sqrt(6) to normalize.\n\nSo the initial state is \u03c8_initial = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nNow, the eigenvector for P=0 is v_p0 = [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, but normalized. Let me compute its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 +0^2 +1^2 = 2 \u2192 norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nWait, but when I project \u03c8_initial onto this eigenvector, the projection is (\u03c8_initial \u22c5 v_p0_normalized) * v_p0_normalized.\n\nAlternatively, the probability is |<v_p0 | \u03c8_initial>|^2.\n\nSo let me compute this inner product.\n\nv_p0_normalized is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\n\u03c8_initial is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) ].\n\nCalculating the terms: (1)(1) = 1, 0*2=0, 1*1=1 \u2192 sum is 2.\n\nSo inner product = (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) ) * 2 = (2) / (sqrt(12)) ) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Because the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the probability is the square of the component of the state in that direction. So yes, 1/3.\n\nSo if we measure P and get 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector v_p0. So the state after measurement is v_p0_normalized multiplied by sqrt(1/3) because the probability is 1/3. Wait, no: the state after measurement is the projection divided by the probability. Let me think.\n\nThe projection of \u03c8_initial onto v_p0_normalized is (inner product) * v_p0_normalized. The inner product was 1/sqrt(3). So the projection is (1/sqrt(3)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) * [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nWait, no: wait, the inner product was (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) * 2 = 2/(sqrt(12)) )= 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3). So the projection is (1/sqrt(3)) * v_p0_normalized. Because the inner product is <v_p0|\u03c8_initial> = 1/sqrt(3), so the projection is (1/sqrt(3)) * v_p0.\n\nWait, maybe I should just compute it as follows.\n\nThe projection operator onto the eigenspace is |v_p0><v_p0|. So the projected state is |v_p0><v_p0|\u03c8_initial>.\n\nWhich is (v_p0)(v_p0\u2020 \u03c8_initial).\n\nv_p0\u2020 \u03c8_initial is the inner product, which is 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the projected state is (1/sqrt(3)) * v_p0.\n\nSo the state after measurement is (1/sqrt(3)) * v_p0.\n\nBut wait, v_p0 is the normalized eigenvector, so it's (1/sqrt(2)) [-1, 0, 1]^T. So the projected state is (1/sqrt(3)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nSo now, we have to measure Q on this state. The operator Q is given by:\n\nQ = [\n[1, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, -1]\n]\n\nSo Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1.\n\nEach diagonal element is the eigenvalue, and the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n\nSo, for Q=1, the eigenvector is [1; 0; 0].\n\nFor Q=0, the eigenvector is [0;1;0].\n\nFor Q=-1, the eigenvector is [0;0;1].\n\nSo the state after measuring P=0 is \u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nWe need to compute the probability of measuring Q=-1 when in state \u03c8_p0.\n\nTo find this, we need to find the component of \u03c8_p0 in the Q=-1 eigenspace, which is the vector [0;0;1].\n\nSo the inner product between \u03c8_p0 and [0;0;1] will give the amplitude, and the square of its absolute value is the probability.\n\nSo compute <eigen_Q=-1 | \u03c8_p0>:\n\n= [0, 0, 1] * (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\n= (1/sqrt(6)) (0*(-1) + 0*0 +1*1) = (1/sqrt(6)) (1) = 1/sqrt(6).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(6))^2 = 1/6.\n\nSo the probability of measuring Q=-1 after P=0 is 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait. So the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities? Because the first measurement must result in P=0, and then the second measurement must result in Q=-1.\n\nSo the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18? No, wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 1/18. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait no, no. Wait, the initial probability of P=0 is 1/3. Then, given that, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/6. So the joint probability is 1/3 multiplied by 1/6, which is 1/18. But that's not one of the options. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the projection of the state after measuring P=0. Let me go through it again.\n\nThe state after measuring P=0 is \u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(3)) * v_p0, where v_p0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [-1, 0, 1]^T. So \u03c8_p0 is (1/sqrt(3))*(1/sqrt(2)) * [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nNow, when measuring Q, which has eigenstates [1;0;0], [0;1;0], [0;0;1].\n\nThe state \u03c8_p0 is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1; 0; 1].\n\nSo to find the probability of Q=-1, which corresponds to the eigenstate [0;0;1], the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * [0, 0, 1] \u00b7 [-1, 0, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(6)) * (0*(-1) + 0*0 +1*1) ) = 1/sqrt(6).\n\nThe probability is (1/sqrt(6))^2 = 1/6.\n\nSo the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute it another way. Let's think about the combined measurement. Alternatively, perhaps the way I approached it is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the state after P=0 is not just the projection but normalized. Wait, no, when you measure P and get 0, the state collapses to the projection, which is \u03c8_p0. So perhaps the state is correctly computed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial state's normalization. Let me double-check that.\n\nThe initial state is given as (-1,2,1). Its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 )= sqrt(6), so the state is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,2,1]^T.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for operator P, the eigenvalue 0 has eigenvector [-1,0,1]^T, which when normalized is (1/sqrt(2)) [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nThe inner product between this and the initial state is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1)(-1) +0*2 +1*1 ] = (1/sqrt(12)) (1 + 0 +1 )= (2)/sqrt(12) )= sqrt(12)/6 = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nThen, the state after measurement is \u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(3)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nSo that's (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nNow, when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.\n\nThe state \u03c8_p0 is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nThe projection onto Q=-1 is the component along [0,0,1].\n\nThe inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * 1 = 1/sqrt(6).\n\nProbability is 1/6.\n\nSo the probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1 is 1/3 * 1/6 = 1/18.\n\nBut none of the options are 1/18. The options are A) 1/2, B)1/3, C)2/3, D)1/6.\n\nHmm, so either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvectors. Let me check the eigenvectors of P again.\n\nWait, when I computed the eigenvectors for P with eigenvalue 0, I found that v2=0, and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form (v1,0, v3) = t*(-1,0,1), right?\n\nYes, that's correct. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, as I thought.\n\nSo the projection is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the state after P=0 is \u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(3)) * v_p0. But v_p0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nSo \u03c8_p0 is (1/sqrt(3)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [-1,0,1]^T = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nNow, when measuring Q, which is diagonal, the probability of each outcome is the square of the corresponding component in the state.\n\nBecause Q's eigenstates are the standard basis vectors.\n\nSo the state is \u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nSo the components are:\n\nComponent along [1,0,0]: (1/sqrt(6))*(-1)\n\nComponent along [0,1,0]: (1/sqrt(6))*0=0\n\nComponent along [0,0,1]: (1/sqrt(6))*1\n\nSo the probabilities are the squares of these.\n\nSo for Q=1: ( (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1) )^2 = 1/6.\n\nFor Q=0: 0.\n\nFor Q=-1: (1/sqrt(6))^2 = 1/6.\n\nWait, so the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/6.\n\nSo the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/6) )= 1/18.\n\nBut that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that after measuring P, the state is in the eigenstate of P=0, and then when measuring Q, the probabilities are calculated in that state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way I'm calculating is correct, but I'm missing a step. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the observables P and Q do not commute. So the order of measurements matters. But the question says measure Q just after P, so the state after P is used for Q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvectors of P. Let me recompute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n\nWait, the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0.\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2.\n\nRow3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0.\n\nWe found the eigenvalues to be 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, let me recompute the eigenvalues to be sure.\n\nThe characteristic equation was -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb^2 +1 ) =0 \u2192 \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1. Correct.\n\nNow, for \u03bb=1:\n\nWe solve (P - I) v =0.\n\nMatrix P-I is:\n\nRow 1: -1, 1/\u221a2, 0.\n\nRow 2:1/\u221a2, -1, 1/\u221a2.\n\nRow3:0,1/\u221a2, -1.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\n-1*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 +0 v3 =0 \u2192 equation 1: v1 = (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nRow2: (1/\u221a2) v1 - v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 substituting v1 from equation1: (1/\u221a2)( (1/\u221a2) v2 ) ) - v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 (1/2) v2 - v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 (-1/2) v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 equation 2: (1/\u221a2) v3 = (1/2) v2 \u2192 v3 = (1/2) v2 * sqrt(2) ) = (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nRow3: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 -v3=0 \u2192 equation3: (1/\u221a2) v2 = v3.\n\nFrom equation2 and 3: equation2 says v3 = (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nEquation3 says v3= (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nSo they are consistent.\n\nSo v3= (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nv1 = (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ (1/\u221a2) v2, v2, (1/\u221a2) v2 ]^T.\n\nLet me choose v2=\u221a2, then:\n\nv1= (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2=1,\n\nv2=\u221a2,\n\nv3= (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2=1.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit large. Let me normalize it.\n\nThe norm squared is 1^2 + (sqrt(2))^2 +1^2 = 1+2+1=4. So norm is 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/2) [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T.\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb=-1, the process would be similar, but let's not get into that now.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm not making progress. Let me think about the state after P=0. It's (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,0,1]^T.\n\nNow, when measuring Q, which is diagonal, the probability of Q=-1 is the square of the third component, right?\n\nBecause Q's eigenstates are the standard basis vectors.\n\nSo the state is:\n\n\u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nThe third component is 1/sqrt(6), so the probability is (1/sqrt(6))^2 =1/6.\n\nSo the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/6.\n\nBut the overall probability of P=0 and then Q=-1 is (1/3) * (1/6) )= 1/18.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the state after measuring P=0 and then find the expectation value of Q, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is not the product but something else. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the two measurements are being considered together. So perhaps the combined probability is the product of the probabilities. But in that case, 1/3 * 1/6 is 1/18, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm. Let me look at the options again. The options are A) 1/2, B)1/3, C)2/3, D)1/6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the probability after P=0. Let me think again.\n\nThe state after P=0 is \u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nTo find the probability of measuring Q=-1, which corresponds to the state [0,0,1], the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * 1 = 1/sqrt(6).\n\nSo the probability is (1/sqrt(6))^2 =1/6.\n\nSo the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/6=1/18. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state after P=0 is not normalized correctly. Wait, no, the state is already normalized because the initial state is normalized, and the projection is into a normalized eigenvector.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the inner product for the probability of P=0.\n\nWait, the initial state is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nThe eigenvector for P=0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nThe inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 +1*1 ] = (1/sqrt(12)) (1 +0 +1 )= 2/sqrt(12) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the measurement of Q is not dependent on the state after P=0. Wait, no, that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the operator Q is diagonal, so in the state \u03c8_p0, the probability of Q=-1 is the square of the third component.\n\nWait, yes, because in the standard basis, each component corresponds to the eigenvalue of Q.\n\nSo in \u03c8_p0, the third component is 1/sqrt(6), so the probability is 1/6.\n\nSo the joint probability is 1/3 *1/6=1/18.\n\nBut that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the eigenspace for P=0 is more than one-dimensional, but earlier calculation shows it's one-dimensional.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues of P.\n\nWait, when I found the eigenvalues, I got 0,1,-1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the determinant calculation.\n\nThe determinant of (P - \u03bb I) is:\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2    -\u03bb      1/\u221a2    |\n|0      1/\u221a2     -\u03bb      |\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0.\n\n= -\u03bb ( \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) - (1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) ].\n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo equation is -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 -1 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb=0, 1, -1. Correct.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are correct.\n\nHmm. I'm not seeing any mistake in the calculations. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be, as the problem must have an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial state's normalization.\n\nWait, the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). Its norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the probabilities differently. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial state is \u03c8 = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nWhen measuring P, the possible outcomes are 1,0,-1. The probabilities are the squares of the projections onto each eigenspace.\n\nWe found that the probability for P=0 is 1/3.\n\nThen, after measuring P=0, the state is \u03c8_p0 = (1/sqrt(3)) * v_p0, where v_p0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1,0,1 ]^T.\n\nSo \u03c8_p0 is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nNow, to find the probability of Q=-1, we look at the component along [0,0,1].\n\nThe amplitude is (1/sqrt(6)) *1 = 1/sqrt(6). So the probability is 1/6.\n\nSo the joint probability is 1/3 *1/6=1/18.\n\nHmm. Since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvectors.\n\nWait, perhaps the eigenvectors for P are different. Let me try to find them again.\n\nFor P and \u03bb=0:\n\nEquations:\n\nRow1: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow2: (1/\u221a2) v1 +0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3=0 \u2192 v1 + v3=0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nRow3: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 +0*v3=0 \u2192 same as row1, v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvector is v = [v1, 0, v3 ] = [ -v3, 0, v3 ] = v3 [ -1, 0, 1 ].\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo I think I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial state is not normalized. Let me check.\n\nNo, the initial state is given as a column vector (-1,2,1). It's not stated whether it's normalized. So perhaps I should not assume it's normalized.\n\nWait, the problem states, \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\". It doesn't say it's normalized. So perhaps I shouldn't normalize it. That changes everything.\n\nWait, if the state is not normalized, then the probabilities are computed differently.\n\nSo the initial state is \u03c8 = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nThe norm is sqrt(6), but perhaps we don't normalize it. Let me think.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, state vectors are typically unit vectors, but perhaps the problem is just using a vector, not necessarily normalized.\n\nWait, but when you compute probabilities, you have to normalize. So perhaps the state is given as (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1,2,1 ]^T.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state that, so perhaps I shouldn't normalize.\n\nWait, no. Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors must be normalized. So perhaps the problem assumes it's already normalized. But in that case, the given vector is not normalized, so perhaps I should normalize it.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\". So perhaps it's a non-normalized vector. So perhaps the state is \u03c8 = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nIn that case, the probabilities would be calculated differently.\n\nWait, let me recalculate everything without normalization.\n\nThe initial state is \u03c8 = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nThe eigenvectors of P are as before.\n\nThe projection onto the eigenspace for P=0 is (v_p0\u2020) \u03c8, where v_p0 is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nThe inner product is [ -1, 0, 1 ] \u00b7 [ -1, 2, 1 ] = (1)(1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) = 2.\n\nThe norm of v_p0 is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 )= sqrt(2).\n\nSo the projection length is 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).\n\nThe norm of \u03c8 is sqrt(6).\n\nSo the probability is (sqrt(2))^2 / (sqrt(6))^2 = 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nSame as before.\n\nThe state after measurement is (v_p0\u2020 \u03c8) / ||\u03c8||^2 * \u03c8_p0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Alternatively, the state after measurement is \u03c8_p0 = (v_p0 / ||v_p0||) * (v_p0\u2020 \u03c8) / (v_p0\u2020 \u03c8).\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to compute the state after measurement as the projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenspace divided by the probability.\n\nSo the projection is ( (v_p0\u2020 \u03c8) / ||v_p0||^2 ) * v_p0.\n\nWhich is (2/sqrt(2)) * v_p0 / sqrt(6)^2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nThe projection operator onto the eigenspace for P=0 is |v_p0><v_p0|, where v_p0 is the normalized eigenvector.\n\nSo the projected state is |v_p0><v_p0|\u03c8>.\n\nWhich is (v_p0\u2020 \u03c8) v_p0.\n\nSo v_p0 is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T / sqrt(2).\n\n\u03c8 is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nSo v_p0\u2020 \u03c8 = [ -1, 0, 1 ] \u00b7 [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(2) = (1 +0 +1)/sqrt(2) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).\n\nSo the projected state is (sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T = [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nSo the state after measurement is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nBut wait, this isn't normalized. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 )= sqrt(2).\n\nSo to get the normalized state, we divide by sqrt(2), giving [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\nNow, when we measure Q, which is diagonal, the probability of Q=-1 is the square of the third component of the state.\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nThus, the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nAh, that matches option D: 1/6.\n\nSo the correct answer is D) 1/6.\n\n\nThe problem involves a quantum system with an initial state vector given as \\( \\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\). The state is not explicitly normalized, so its norm is calculated as \\( \\|\\psi\\| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6} \\). The normalized initial state is therefore \\( \\psi_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \\( P \\)\nThe operator \\( P \\) is given as:\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nTo find the eigenvalues, the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\) is solved. This yields the eigenvalues \\( \\lambda = 0, 1, -1 \\).\n\nFor \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), the eigenvector is found by solving \\( (P - 0I)v = 0 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure out what it's asking.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, hold on. That doesn't look like a unit vector. Because the state vectors in quantum mechanics should be normalized, right? The length should be 1. Let me check. The vector is (-1, 2, 1). So the magnitude squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so it's sqrt(6) in magnitude. So I guess the actual state vector is this vector divided by sqrt(6). So the state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T. I should remember that when I do calculations.\n\nThe operators for observables P and Q are given. Let me write them down.\n\nOperator P's matrix:\nFirst row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nSecond row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nThird row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nOperator Q's matrix:\nFirst row: 1, 0, 0\nSecond row: 0, 0, 0\nThird row: 0, 0, -1\n\nThe question is: what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when Q is measured just after P.\n\nHmm. So the process is first measure P, then measure Q. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the order of measurements matters because measuring one observable can change the state of the system due to wavefunction collapse. So if we measure P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then measuring Q would be done on this new state.\n\nWait, but I need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So first, let's find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. Then, given that P was measured to be 0, find the probability that Q is measured to be -1. Multiply these probabilities together, because both must happen.\n\nSo first, let's find the possible eigenvalues of P and Q.\n\nWait, for operator P, what are the eigenvalues? Let me think. The matrix for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:\n\nP = [\n [0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nI need to find the eigenvalues of P. Hmm, that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenstates of P.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a better way. Because when measuring P, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. So if I can find the eigenvectors of P, I can see what the state becomes after the measurement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probabilities without explicitly finding eigenstates. Because the initial state is given, so when measuring P, the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the inner product between the initial state and the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nWait, but I don't know the eigenvectors of P. Hmm. Maybe I can find them.\n\nLet me try to compute the eigenvalues of P. The characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nThe matrix P - \u03bb I is:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n[ 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n[ 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 [ ... ]\n\nWait, maybe expanding along the first row. Let's compute the determinant.\n\nFirst term: (-\u03bb) * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] )\n\nWhich is (-\u03bb) [ (\u03bb^2) - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] )\n\nWhich is - (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) [ -\u03bb/(\u221a2) ) ] = (\u03bb)/(2)\n\nThird term: 0, so no contribution.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb) [ \u03bb^2 - 1/2 ] + (\u03bb/2) = 0\n\nFactor out \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb [ - (\u03bb^2 - 1/2) + 1/2 ] = 0\n\nWait, let me compute each part:\n\nFirst part: (-\u03bb)(\u03bb^2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)/2\n\nSecond part: + (\u03bb/2 )\n\nSo total:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2 ) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0\n\nSo, -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb^2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb^2 )= 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So P has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.\n\nSo possible outcomes when measuring P are 1, 0, -1.\n\nThe problem is asking about the probability of getting 0 for P.\n\nSo to find the probability of P=0, I need the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nWait, let's find the eigenvectors for P.\n\nFor \u03bb=0:\n\nSolve (P - 0 I ) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n1) 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\n2) (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0.\n\n3) 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSo from equation 1 and 3, v2=0.\n\nEquation 2 gives v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1 ) \u2192 v = v1 (1, 0, -1 )\n\nBut we can write this as (1,0,-1) multiplied by a scalar. So the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is (1, 0, -1 ) up to normalization.\n\nThe normalized eigenvector would be (1,0,-1) / sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 ) \u2192 (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the eigenstate for P=0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.\n\nNow, the initial state is |\u03c8> = ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the given state is the column vector (-1, 2, 1). But I thought it's not normalized. So |\u03c8> is ( (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nBecause the magnitude squared is 6, so normalization factor is 1/sqrt(6).\n\nSo, to find the probability that measuring P gives 0, we calculate the inner product between |\u03c8> and the eigenvector |0>, which is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the amplitude is <0|\u03c8> = [1/sqrt(2)]*(-1/sqrt(6)) + [0]*[2/sqrt(6)] + [ (-1)/sqrt(2) ]*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nCalculating:\n\n= [ (-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\n= (-1 -1) / (sqrt(12)) ) \u2192 (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude.\n\nSo | (-1)/sqrt(3) |^2 = (1/3).\n\nSo the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.\n\nNow, after measuring P=0, the system collapses into the eigenstate |0>, which is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, we need to measure Q on this state.\n\nWhat are the possible outcomes for Q? Let's look at the matrix for Q.\n\nQ is diagonal: [1, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, -1].\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nWait, but looking at the diagonal entries, the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nWait, no: the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are the diagonal elements. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nSo when measuring Q, possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that Q is measured as -1.\n\nSo the eigenvector corresponding to Q=-1 is the third basis vector, (0,0,1), because the matrix Q has -1 in the (3,3) position.\n\nSo the eigenstate for Q=-1 is |q-1> = (0,0,1)^T.\n\nNow, the state after measuring P=0 is |0> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nWe need to find the inner product between |0> and |q-1>, which is <q-1 | 0>.\n\nSo <q-1|0> is (0,0,1) \u00b7 (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2) ) \u2192 (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) / sqrt(2) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude.\n\nSo | (-1/sqrt(2) ) |^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the overall probability of P=0 and then Q=-1 is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Another approach: since the system after P=0 is |0>, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2), when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Q. The state |0> can be written in terms of the eigenstates of Q.\n\nSo let's express |0> as a linear combination of the eigenstates of Q.\n\nThe eigenstates of Q are:\n\n|q=1> = (1,0,0)^T,\n\n|q=0> = (0,1,0)^T,\n\n|q=-1> = (0,0,1)^T.\n\nSo |0> = a|q=1> + b|q=0> + c|q=-1>.\n\nBut |0> is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo a = 1/sqrt(2), b=0, c = (-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo when you measure Q on |0>, the probability of each outcome is the square of the modulus of the coefficient.\n\nSo for q=-1, it's |c|^2 = (1/2).\n\nSo the probability is 1/2, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo combining the two probabilities: 1/3 (for P=0) multiplied by 1/2 (for Q=-1 given P=0) gives 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n",

So the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is (1, 0, -1 ) up to normalization.\n\nThe normalized eigenvector would be (1,0,-1) / sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 ) \u2192 (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the eigenstate for P=0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.\n\nNow, the initial state is |\u03c8> = ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the given state is the column vector (-1, 2, 1). But I thought it's not normalized. So |\u03c8> is ( (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nBecause the magnitude squared is 6, so normalization factor is 1/sqrt(6).\n\nSo, to find the probability that measuring P gives 0, we calculate the inner product between |\u03c8> and the eigenvector |0>, which is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the amplitude is <0|\u03c8> = [1/sqrt(2)]*(-1/sqrt(6)) + [0]*[2/sqrt(6)] + [ (-1)/sqrt(2) ]*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nCalculating:\n\n= [ (-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\n= (-1 -1) / (sqrt(12)) ) \u2192 (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude.\n\nSo | (-1)/sqrt(3) |^2 = (1/3).\n\nSo the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.\n\nNow, after measuring P=0, the system collapses into the eigenstate |0>, which is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, we need to measure Q on this state.\n\nWhat are the possible outcomes for Q? Let's look at the matrix for Q.\n\nQ is diagonal: [1, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, -1].\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nWait, but looking at the diagonal entries, the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nWait, no: the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are the diagonal elements. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nSo when measuring Q, possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that Q is measured as -1.\n\nSo the eigenvector corresponding to Q=-1 is the third basis vector, (0,0,1), because the matrix Q has -1 in the (3,3) position.\n\nSo the eigenstate for Q=-1 is |q-1> = (0,0,1)^T.\n\nNow, the state after measuring P=0 is |0> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nWe need to find the inner product between |0> and |q-1>, which is <q-1 | 0>.\n\nSo <q-1|0> is (0,0,1) \u00b7 (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2) ) \u2192 (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) / sqrt(2) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude.\n\nSo | (-1/sqrt(2) ) |^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the overall probability of P=0 and then Q=-1 is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Another approach: since the system after P=0 is |0>, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2), when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Q. The state |0> can be written in terms of the eigenstates of Q.\n\nSo let's express |0> as a linear combination of the eigenstates of Q.\n\nThe eigenstates of Q are:\n\n|q=1> = (1,0,0)^T,\n\n|q=0> = (0,1,0)^T,\n\n|q=-1> = (0,0,1)^T.\n\nSo |0> = a|q=1> + b|q=0> + c|q=-1>.\n\nBut |0> is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo a = 1/sqrt(2), b=0, c = (-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo when you measure Q on |0>, the probability of each outcome is the square of the modulus of the coefficient.\n\nSo for q=-1, it's |c|^2 = (1/2).\n\nSo the probability is 1/2, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo combining the two probabilities: 1/3 (for P=0) multiplied by 1/2 (for Q=-1 given P=0) gives 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n\n\nThe problem involves a quantum system with an initial state vector given as \\( \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\). This vector is not normalized, so the normalized state is:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTwo observables, \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), are represented by their respective operators. The task is to find the probability of obtaining \\( P = 0 \\) followed by \\( Q = -1 \\) in sequential measurements.\n\n### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\( P \\)\nThe operator \\( P \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalues of \\( P \\) are found by solving the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\). This yields the eigenvalues \\( \\lambda = 1, 0, -1 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nSo, the problem states that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that's a vector with three components. So the system is a three-level quantum system, maybe like a qutrit or something. The operators for two observables, P and Q, are given as 3x3 matrices. The question is about measuring P and then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability of each outcome is determined by the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nSo, the approach here should be: first, find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P. Then, measure P, which will collapse the state into one of P's eigenvectors. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state. Then, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0. Then, we use this new state to find the probability of measuring Q and getting -1.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The problem says \"the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements.\" So it's the combined probability, right? So the total probability is the probability of getting 0 in P times the probability of getting -1 in Q given that P was 0.\n\nBut first, let's get the initial state vector. The state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I think that should be a normalized vector. Let me check. The norm is sqrt[ (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ] = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T. Because quantum states are vectors with unit length.\n\nNow, let's look at the operator P. The matrix for P is:\n\nFirst row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nSecond row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\n\nThird row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nHmm, so P is a 3x3 matrix. To find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, perhaps it's easier to see if it has any symmetries or patterns.\n\nAlternatively, I could write the matrix explicitly.\n\nWait, let me write it out:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nLooking at this matrix, I notice that it's symmetric, so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. Let me think about possible eigenvectors.\n\nLooking for eigenvectors, maybe some obvious ones. For example, let's consider a vector like (1, 0, -1). Let me see what P does to this vector.\n\nP * [1, 0, -1]^T:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1 -1)/\u221a2 = 0\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0\n\nSo P * v = [0, 0, 0]^T. So this vector is in the null space of P. So the eigenvalue 0 has eigenvector (1, 0, -1) or any scalar multiple. Wait, but let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, wait, the result of P times [1, 0, -1] is zero vector? Because:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1 -1)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSo yes, that vector is in the null space, so the eigenvalue 0 is correct. So that's one eigenvector. Let's normalize it. The vector is (1, 0, -1). Its norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo that's one eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0.\n\nNow, are there other eigenvectors? Since it's a 3x3 matrix, we should have three eigenvalues.\n\nWait, perhaps the trace of P is zero? Because the diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So the trace is zero. So the sum of the eigenvalues is zero. So if one eigenvalue is 0, the other two must add up to zero as well. So maybe another eigenvalue is a, and another is -a.\n\nHmm, but let me think about another approach. Let me compute the characteristic equation of P. The determinant of (P - \u03bb I) should be zero.\n\nBut that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can find another eigenvector by considering vectors that are symmetric in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps considering a vector like (1, 1, 1). Let's see if this is an eigenvector.\n\nP * [1,1,1]^T:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*1 = 1/\u221a2.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (1 +1)/\u221a2 = 2/\u221a2 = sqrt(2).\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*1 = 1/\u221a2.\n\nSo the resulting vector is (1/\u221a2, sqrt(2), 1/\u221a2)^T. Hmm, is this a scalar multiple of [1,1,1]? Let's see: 1/\u221a2 \u2248 0.707, sqrt(2) \u22481.414, 1/\u221a2\u22480.707.\n\nSo the first component is 0.707, the second is 1.414, the third is 0.707. That's not a scalar multiple of [1,1,1], so that vector isn't an eigenvector.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's try to find the eigenvalues by solving det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nThe matrix P - \u03bb I is:\n\n[-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nCalculating the determinant of this matrix:\n\nI can use the rule for 3x3 determinants. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to expand along the first row.\n\ndet(P - \u03bb I) = -\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] ) \n              - (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] )\n              + 0 * something.\n\nSo, first term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] = -\u03bb ( \u03bb^2 - (1/2) )\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)*0 ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/2.\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo overall determinant:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb^2 - 1/2 ) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nWait, because -\u03bb (\u03bb^2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) \u2192 -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2).\n\nThen, the second term is + \u03bb/2.\n\nSo adding them: (-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb/2) + \u03bb/2 = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the determinant is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb^2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb^2) = 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1.\n\nAh! So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalue 0 has eigenvector we found earlier: (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nEigenvalue 1 and -1 have other eigenvectors. But for this problem, we only care about the eigenvalue 0 because the question is about getting 0 for P.\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is the square of the amplitude of the initial state in the eigenvector corresponding to 0.\n\nWait, but the initial state is |\u03c8> = (-1, 2, 1)^T / sqrt(6).\n\nWait, no, the given state is (-1, 2, 1), but we need to normalize it. So the initial state is |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).\n\nThe eigenvector for P=0 is |p0> = [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the inner product <p0 | \u03c8> is (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-1) + 0 + (-1) ] / sqrt(6) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the inner product is the conjugate transpose of |p0> times |\u03c8>.\n\nSo |p0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo <p0 | \u03c8> is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) = -1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = -1/sqrt(12) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nThird term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) = -1/(sqrt(12)) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nAdding them together: (-1/(2\u221a3)) + (-1/(2\u221a3)) ) = -2/(2\u221a3) )= -1/\u221a3.\n\nSo the inner product is -1/\u221a3.\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value: | -1/\u221a3 |^2 = (1/3).\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The inner product is (-1/sqrt(3)), so the square is (1/3), right.\n\nSo that's the first part: the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nNow, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |p0> which is [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, we need to measure Q. The operator Q is given as:\n\nQ = [\n[1, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, -1]\n]\n\nSo the matrix is diagonal. So its eigenvalues are 1 (for the first basis vector), 0 (second), and -1 (third).\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nWait, no. The diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nWait, but let me think. The diagonal matrix has the eigenvalues along the diagonal, so yes, the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n\nSo for Q, the eigenvector for eigenvalue 1 is |q1> = [1, 0, 0]^T.\n\nEigenvalue 0: |q0> = [0, 1, 0]^T.\n\nEigenvalue -1: |q-1> = [0, 0, 1]^T.\n\nSo now, the state after measuring P=0 is |p0> = [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2).\n\nWe need to find the probability of measuring Q=-1.\n\nThat is, the probability is the square of the amplitude of |q-1> in |p0>.\n\nSo the inner product <q-1 | p0> is [0, 0, 1] * [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2) \u2192 (0 + 0 + (-1))/sqrt(2) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/2).\n\nSo the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nSo the combined probability is the probability of P=0 (1/3) multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given P=0 (1/2), so 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. So the overall probability is the probability that P=0 and then Q=-1. So it's 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nSo, the problem states that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that's a vector with three components. So the system is a three-level quantum system, maybe like a qutrit or something. The operators for two observables, P and Q, are given as 3x3 matrices. The question is about measuring P and then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability of each outcome is determined by the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nSo, the approach here should be: first, find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P. Then, measure P, which will collapse the state into one of P's eigenvectors. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state. Then, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0. Then, we use this new state to find the probability of measuring Q and getting -1.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The problem says \"the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements.\" So it's the combined probability, right? So the total probability is the probability of getting 0 in P times the probability of getting -1 in Q given that P was 0.\n\nBut first, let's get the initial state vector. The state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I think that should be a normalized vector. Let me check. The norm is sqrt[ (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ] = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T. Because quantum states are vectors with unit length.\n\nNow, let's look at the operator P. The matrix for P is:\n\nFirst row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nSecond row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\n\nThird row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nHmm, so P is a 3x3 matrix. To find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, perhaps it's easier to see if it has any symmetries or patterns.\n\nAlternatively, I could write the matrix explicitly.\n\nWait, let me write it out:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nLooking at this matrix, I notice that it's symmetric, so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. Let me think about possible eigenvectors.\n\nLooking for eigenvectors, maybe some obvious ones. For example, let's consider a vector like (1, 0, -1). Let me see what P does to this vector.\n\nP * [1, 0, -1]^T:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1 -1)/\u221a2 = 0\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0\n\nSo P * v = [0, 0, 0]^T. So this vector is in the null space of P. So the eigenvalue 0 has eigenvector (1, 0, -1) or any scalar multiple. Wait, but let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, wait, the result of P times [1, 0, -1] is zero vector? Because:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1 -1)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSo yes, that vector is in the null space, so the eigenvalue 0 is correct. So that's one eigenvector. Let's normalize it. The vector is (1, 0, -1). Its norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo that's one eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0.\n\nNow, are there other eigenvectors? Since it's a 3x3 matrix, we should have three eigenvalues.\n\nWait, perhaps the trace of P is zero? Because the diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So the trace is zero. So the sum of the eigenvalues is zero. So if one eigenvalue is 0, the other two must add up to zero as well. So maybe another eigenvalue is a, and another is -a.\n\nHmm, but let me think about another approach. Let me compute the characteristic equation of P. The determinant of (P - \u03bb I) should be zero.\n\nBut that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can find another eigenvector by considering vectors that are symmetric in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps considering a vector like (1, 1, 1). Let's see if this is an eigenvector.\n\nP * [1,1,1]^T:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*1 = 1/\u221a2.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (1 +1)/\u221a2 = 2/\u221a2 = sqrt(2).\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*1 = 1/\u221a2.\n\nSo the resulting vector is (1/\u221a2, sqrt(2), 1/\u221a2)^T. Hmm, is this a scalar multiple of [1,1,1]? Let's see: 1/\u221a2 \u2248 0.707, sqrt(2) \u22481.414, 1/\u221a2\u22480.707.\n\nSo the first component is 0.707, the second is 1.414, the third is 0.707. That's not a scalar multiple of [1,1,1], so that vector isn't an eigenvector.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's try to find the eigenvalues by solving det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nThe matrix P - \u03bb I is:\n\n[-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nCalculating the determinant of this matrix:\n\nI can use the rule for 3x3 determinants. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to expand along the first row.\n\ndet(P - \u03bb I) = -\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] ) \n              - (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] )\n              + 0 * something.\n\nSo, first term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] = -\u03bb ( \u03bb^2 - (1/2) )\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)*0 ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/2.\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo overall determinant:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb^2 - 1/2 ) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nWait, because -\u03bb (\u03bb^2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) \u2192 -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2).\n\nThen, the second term is + \u03bb/2.\n\nSo adding them: (-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb/2) + \u03bb/2 = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the determinant is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb^2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb^2) = 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1.\n\nAh! So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalue 0 has eigenvector we found earlier: (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nEigenvalue 1 and -1 have other eigenvectors. But for this problem, we only care about the eigenvalue 0 because the question is about getting 0 for P.\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is the square of the amplitude of the initial state in the eigenvector corresponding to 0.\n\nWait, but the initial state is |\u03c8> = (-1, 2, 1)^T / sqrt(6).\n\nWait, no, the given state is (-1, 2, 1), but we need to normalize it. So the initial state is |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).\n\nThe eigenvector for P=0 is |p0> = [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the inner product <p0 | \u03c8> is (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-1) + 0 + (-1) ] / sqrt(6) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the inner product is the conjugate transpose of |p0> times |\u03c8>.\n\nSo |p0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo <p0 | \u03c8> is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) = -1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = -1/sqrt(12) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nThird term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) = -1/(sqrt(12)) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nAdding them together: (-1/(2\u221a3)) + (-1/(2\u221a3)) ) = -2/(2\u221a3) )= -1/\u221a3.\n\nSo the inner product is -1/\u221a3.\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value: | -1/\u221a3 |^2 = (1/3).\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The inner product is (-1/sqrt(3)), so the square is (1/3), right.\n\nSo that's the first part: the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nNow, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |p0> which is [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, we need to measure Q. The operator Q is given as:\n\nQ = [\n[1, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, -1]\n]\n\nSo the matrix is diagonal. So its eigenvalues are 1 (for the first basis vector), 0 (second), and -1 (third).\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nWait, no. The diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nWait, but let me think. The diagonal matrix has the eigenvalues along the diagonal, so yes, the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n\nSo for Q, the eigenvector for eigenvalue 1 is |q1> = [1, 0, 0]^T.\n\nEigenvalue 0: |q0> = [0, 1, 0]^T.\n\nEigenvalue -1: |q-1> = [0, 0, 1]^T.\n\nSo now, the state after measuring P=0 is |p0> = [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2).\n\nWe need to find the probability of measuring Q=-1.\n\nThat is, the probability is the square of the amplitude of |q-1> in |p0>.\n\nSo the inner product <q-1 | p0> is [0, 0, 1] * [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2) \u2192 (0 + 0 + (-1))/sqrt(2) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/2).\n\nSo the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nSo the combined probability is the probability of P=0 (1/3) multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given P=0 (1/2), so 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. So the overall probability is the probability that P=0 and then Q=-1. So it's 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait. Did I make any mistakes in the calculations?\n\nLet me recap.\n\n1. The initial state |\u03c8> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).\n\n2. P's eigenvectors: for eigenvalue 0, it's [1,0,-1]^T / sqrt(2).\n\n3. The inner product <p0 | \u03c8> is (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) all divided by sqrt(2)*sqrt(6). Wait, no. Wait, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nWhich is [ (-1) -1 ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) \u2192 (-2)/(sqrt(12)) \u2192 (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nThen, the state after measurement is |p0>, which is [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the probability to measure Q=-1 is the square of the component in |q-1>.\n\nThe component is [0,0,1] \u00b7 [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe square is 1/2.\n\nSo the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nWhich is option D.\n\n\nThe problem involves a three-level quantum system with an initial state vector \\( |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}/\\sqrt{6} \\), and two observables \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) represented by their respective operators.

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that doesn't look normalized. Oh wait, maybe I should normalize it first because probabilities depend on that.\n\nSo the state vector is a column vector: [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me find its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector would be (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. So each component is multiplied by 1/sqrt(6).\n\nNext, we have two operators, P and Q. The problem is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.\n\nWait, the question is about measuring P and then Q. But wait, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So after measuring P and getting a value, the state will be the corresponding eigenstate of P. Then, measuring Q would be done on this new state.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem is about measuring P, getting 0, and then measuring Q, getting -1. So I need to find the probability of both happening in that order.\n\nBut let's break it down into steps.\n\nFirst, find the possible eigenvalues and eigenstates of P. Then, see the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. Once we have that, the state collapses to the corresponding eigenstate. Then, for that state, compute the probability of getting -1 when measuring Q.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should first compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q.

Let me write it out:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nI need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for P. But wait, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues first.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo let's set up the matrix (P - \u03bb I):\n\nRow 1: [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nHmm, the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. Let's compute it.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * something.\n\nWait, perhaps expanding along the first row would be easier.\n\nSo:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb) * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)^2 ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 * something.\n\nSo compute each part:\n\nFirst term: (-\u03bb) [ \u03bb^2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ] \u2192 because (1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb) = -\u03bb/(\u221a2), and that's the element.\n\nWait, wait. The minor for the second element (position 1,2) is the determinant of the submatrix when row 1 and column 2 are removed.\n\nSo the submatrix is:\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo for position (1,2), the minor is:\n\n[ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2],\n  [0, -\u03bb] ]\n\nWait no, wait. When you remove row 1 and column 2, the remaining elements are:\n\nRow 2: columns 1 and 3 \u2192 1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: columns 1 and 3 \u2192 0, -\u03bb\n\nSo the minor is:\n\n|1/\u221a2  1/\u221a2|\n| 0     -\u03bb  |\n\nDeterminant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) )= -\u03bb/(\u221a2).\n\nSo the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/(\u221a2)) ) \u2192 but wait, the sign is (-1)^(1+2) = -1, so the cofactor is negative of the minor. So the second term is - (1/\u221a2) * ( -\u03bb/(\u221a2) ) \u2192 because the cofactor is (-1)^{1+2} * minor.\n\nWait, maybe I should think more carefully.\n\nThe determinant expansion for 3x3 matrix is:\n\na(ei \u2212 fh) \u2212 b(di \u2212 fg) + c(dh \u2212 eg)\n\nBut in our case, the first row is [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb) * det( [ [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ] ] ) - (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ], [0, -\u03bb ] ] ) + 0 * something.\n\nWait, that's probably a better approach.\n\nSo first term: (-\u03bb) * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] = (-\u03bb) * [ \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ]\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] = -(1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ] \u2192 -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) )= (\u03bb)/(2)\n\nThird term is 0, so no contribution.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0.\n\nLet's expand this:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) ) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSet equal to zero: -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) =0 \u2192 \u03bb(1 - \u03bb\u00b2) =0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb= -1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when P is measured, the outcome is 0. So the state collapses into the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nSo now I need to find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nLet's solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSo from the first equation, v2=0.\n\nFrom the third equation, same as first, v2=0.\n\nFrom the second equation, v1 + v3=0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. So any scalar multiple of [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nBut we can normalize it. The length squared is 1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2 \u2192 length is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nSo the eigenstate for P=0 is |\u03c8_p> = [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, after measuring P and getting 0, the state becomes |\u03c8_p>, right?\n\nSo the state after P measurement is |\u03c8_p> = [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the next step is to measure Q on this state and find the probability of getting -1.\n\nWait, but what's the matrix for Q? Let me check.\n\nThe matrix for Q is given as:\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 0\n\nRow 2: 0, 0, 0\n\nRow 3: 0, 0, -1\n\nSo Q = [\n[1, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, -1]\n]\n\nSo Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.\n\nThe eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n\nSo the eigenstates are:\n\nFor eigenvalue 1: [1,0,0]^T\n\nFor eigenvalue 0: [0,1,0]^T\n\nFor eigenvalue -1: [0,0,1]^T\n\nSo when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1, each with their own probabilities.\n\nNow, the state after P measurement is |\u03c8_p> = [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2). Let me write it as (1/sqrt(2)) |e1> - (1/sqrt(2)) |e3>, where |e1> is [1,0,0], |e3> is [0,0,1].\n\nWait, no: |e3> is [0,0,1], so |\u03c8_p> is (1/sqrt(2)) |e1> - (1/sqrt(2)) |e3>.\n\nSo when we measure Q on this state, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Q, which are 1, 0, and -1. But the state is a linear combination of |e1> and |e3> only, so the only possible outcomes are 1 and -1. The component in |e2> is zero, so probability of 0 is zero.\n\nWait, but wait, the state is |\u03c8_p> = (1/sqrt(2)) |e1> + (0)|e2> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |e3>.\n\nSo the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude for that eigenstate.\n\nSo for eigenvalue 1 (from |e1>), the amplitude is 1/sqrt(2), so probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nFor eigenvalue -1 (from |e3>), the amplitude is (-1/sqrt(2)), so probability is (1/2).\n\nWait, but the question asks for the probability of getting -1 for Q. So that's 1/2.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial state after P measurement is |\u03c8_p>, and the question is the probability that Q is measured as -1.\n\nSo the probability is 1/2.\n\nWait, but the question is about the combined probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So the overall probability is the product of the probability of getting 0 for P and the conditional probability of getting -1 for Q given that P was 0.\n\nSo first, what's the probability of measuring P=0 in the initial state.\n\nThe initial state is |\u03c8_initial> = [-1, 2, 1]^T / sqrt(6).\n\nWe can compute the probability as the square of the inner product between |\u03c8_initial> and |\u03c8_p>, where |\u03c8_p> is the eigenvector for P=0.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\n|\u03c8_initial> is (-1, 2, 1)/sqrt(6).\n\n|\u03c8_p> is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe inner product is [ (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ] / (sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)) ) = [ (-1) + 0 + (-1) ] / sqrt(12) ) = (-2)/ (2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute square is (1/3).\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nThen, given that P=0, the state becomes |\u03c8_p>, and the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nSo the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait, earlier I thought the probability of getting -1 in Q is 1/2. Because the state is (1/sqrt(2)) |e1> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |e3>, so when you measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1 and -1, each with probability 1/2.\n\nWait, that's correct. So the probability for Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nSo the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n",

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that doesn't look normalized. Oh wait, maybe I should normalize it first because probabilities depend on that.\n\nSo the state vector is a column vector: [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me find its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector would be (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. So each component is multiplied by 1/sqrt(6).\n\nNext, we have two operators, P and Q. The problem is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.\n\nWait, the question is about measuring P and then Q. But wait, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So after measuring P and getting a value, the state will be the corresponding eigenstate of P. Then, measuring Q would be done on this new state.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem is about measuring P, getting 0, and then measuring Q, getting -1.

Let me write it as (1/sqrt(2)) |e1> - (1/sqrt(2)) |e3>, where |e1> is [1,0,0], |e3> is [0,0,1].\n\nWait, no: |e3> is [0,0,1], so |\u03c8_p> is (1/sqrt(2)) |e1> - (1/sqrt(2)) |e3>.\n\nSo when we measure Q on this state, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Q, which are 1, 0, and -1. But the state is a linear combination of |e1> and |e3> only, so the only possible outcomes are 1 and -1. The component in |e2> is zero, so probability of 0 is zero.\n\nWait, but wait, the state is |\u03c8_p> = (1/sqrt(2)) |e1> + (0)|e2> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |e3>.\n\nSo the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude for that eigenstate.\n\nSo for eigenvalue 1 (from |e1>), the amplitude is 1/sqrt(2), so probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nFor eigenvalue -1 (from |e3>), the amplitude is (-1/sqrt(2)), so probability is (1/2).\n\nWait, but the question asks for the probability of getting -1 for Q. So that's 1/2.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial state after P measurement is |\u03c8_p>, and the question is the probability that Q is measured as -1.\n\nSo the probability is 1/2.\n\nWait, but the question is about the combined probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So the overall probability is the product of the probability of getting 0 for P and the conditional probability of getting -1 for Q given that P was 0.\n\nSo first, what's the probability of measuring P=0 in the initial state.\n\nThe initial state is |\u03c8_initial> = [-1, 2, 1]^T / sqrt(6).\n\nWe can compute the probability as the square of the inner product between |\u03c8_initial> and |\u03c8_p>, where |\u03c8_p> is the eigenvector for P=0.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\n|\u03c8_initial> is (-1, 2, 1)/sqrt(6).\n\n|\u03c8_p> is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe inner product is [ (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ] / (sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)) ) = [ (-1) + 0 + (-1) ] / sqrt(12) ) = (-2)/ (2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute square is (1/3).\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nThen, given that P=0, the state becomes |\u03c8_p>, and the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nSo the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait, earlier I thought the probability of getting -1 in Q is 1/2. Because the state is (1/sqrt(2)) |e1> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |e3>, so when you measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1 and -1, each with probability 1/2.\n\nWait, that's correct. So the probability for Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nSo the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n\n\nThe problem involves a quantum system with an initial state vector given as \n\n\\[\n|\\psi_{\\text{initial}}\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThis vector is not normalized, so it is normalized by dividing by its norm, \n\n\\[\n\\|\\psi_{\\text{initial}}\\| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the normalized initial state is \n\n\\[\n|\\psi_{\\text{initial}}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe system is subject to two observables, \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), represented by the operators:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix} \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \nQ = \\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & -1 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\(P\\)\nThe eigenvalues of \\(P\\) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \\(\\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0\\).

The inner product is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_p | \\psi_{\\text{initial}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\left[ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) \\right] = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\nThe absolute square gives the probability:\n\n\\[\nP(P = 0) = \\left| \\langle \\psi_p | \\psi_{\\text{initial}} \\rangle \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: State after measuring \\(P = 0\\)\nIf \\(P = 0\\) is measured, the system collapses to the eigenstate \\(|\\psi_p\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}\\).\n\n### Step 4: Probability of measuring \\(Q = -1\\) after \\(P = 0\\)\nThe operator \\(Q\\) is diagonal with eigenvalues \\(1, 0, -1\\), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are represented by vectors, usually column vectors, and these vectors need to be normalized. So I should probably check if this state is normalized. To do that, I'll calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let's compute the norm: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, right, so the norm is sqrt(6). So to get a unit vector, we should divide each component by sqrt(6). But wait, the problem doesn't mention normalization, so maybe the state isn't normalized. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, states are typically assumed to be normalized. I'll keep that in mind. Maybe the given state isn't normalized, but perhaps the operators are such that it doesn't matter for the probabilities? Or maybe I'm supposed to normalize it first.\n\nMoving on, the operators P and Q are given as square matrices. Let me write them down.\n\nOperator P's matrix:\nFirst row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\nSecond row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nThird row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nOperator Q's matrix:\nFirst row: [1, 0, 0]\nSecond row: [0, 0, 0]\nThird row: [0, 0, -1]\n\nWait, Q is a diagonal matrix. So its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. Because the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1. And when you measure Q, the possible results are these eigenvalues.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first, then Q. Wait, no, the order is Q just after P. So the measurements are done in the order P first, then Q. So I need to find the probability that when I measure P, I get 0, and then when I measure Q, I get -1.\n\nWait, but no, wait. The wording is a bit ambiguous. It says, \"the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements.\" So I think that means the first measurement is P, getting 0, and then the second measurement of Q, given that the state has collapsed to the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0. So I need to find the probability that P=0 and then, in that new state, Q=-1.\n\nWait, but the measurement of Q is after P, so the state after measuring P will be the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, in that state, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is what I need. So the overall probability is the product of the probability of P=0 and, given that P=0, the probability of Q=-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the joint probability, but I think in quantum mechanics, the measurements are sequential, so the second measurement is done on the state post the first measurement. So it's the product of the probabilities.\n\nBut wait, wait, another approach: perhaps the state is first measured in P, and then in Q. So the first step is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then compute the projection of the initial state onto that eigenvector. That gives the probability of getting 0 for P. Then, once you have that state, compute the probability of measuring Q=-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should compute the probability as the absolute square of the amplitude of the combined event. Hmm. Let's think.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\n2. Compute the projection of the initial state onto this eigenvector. The square of the absolute value of this projection gives the probability of measuring P=0.\n\n3. Once the state collapses to the eigenvector of P=0, compute the probability of measuring Q=-1.\n\n4. Multiply these two probabilities to get the desired probability.\n\nWait, but wait. No, the first part is the probability to get P=0, and then, given that, the probability to get Q=-1. So the total probability is the product of these two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state after measuring P=0 is the eigenvector (up to normalization). So I need to compute the projection, then compute the expectation for Q in that state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to calculate the probabilities in a different way. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I'll need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n\nSo operator P has the matrix:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nHmm. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I can observe the structure. Let me try to see if P is a Hermitian matrix, which it should be since it's an observable.\n\nLooking at P:\n\n- The elements are real, so it's symmetric if it's Hermitian. Wait, P's (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), (2,1) is 1/sqrt(2), so that's symmetric. Similarly, (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), (3,2) is 1/sqrt(2). So yes, P is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So eigenvalues are real.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P can be found by solving the characteristic equation.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think about the matrix. It looks like a tridiagonal matrix with zeros on the diagonal, and 1/sqrt(2) on the super and subdiagonals except for (2,3) and (3,2), which are 1/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, maybe it's a symmetric matrix with a specific structure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by noting that P^2 is a certain matrix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the eigenvalues.\n\nLet me write the matrix:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nSo, the characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nThe matrix P - \u03bb I is:\n\n[-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb]\n\nCalculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's proceed.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)*0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]\n\nSo expanding along the first row:\n\n= -\u03bb [ \u03bb^2 - (1/2) ] - (1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) ] + 0\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) + (1/\u221a2)( \u03bb / \u221a2 )\n\nSimplify the second term: (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2)\n\nSo the determinant equation becomes:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0\n\nFactor:\n\n\u03bb (-\u03bb^2 + 1) ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb^2 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0 or \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So P has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the determinant calculation, because I might have made a mistake.\n\nThe determinant is calculated as:\n\nFor the first row: element (1,1) is -\u03bb. The minor is the 2x2 matrix:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n[ 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nWhich has determinant ( (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) ) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nSo the first term is (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nThen, the second element in the first row is 1/\u221a2. The minor is the 2x2 matrix:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ]\n[0, -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, no, wait. The minor is the submatrix when you remove row 1 and column 2.\n\nSo the minor is:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo for element (1,2), the minor is:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nBut wait, columns 1 and 3. So for (1,2), the minor is:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ]\n[0, -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, no, because in the minor for (1,2), the rows are 2 and 3, and columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo row 2: columns 1 and 3 are 1/\u221a2 and 1/\u221a2.\n\nRow 3: columns 1 and 3 are 0 and -\u03bb.\n\nSo the minor matrix is:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[0, -\u03bb]\n\nThe determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) )= -\u03bb/(\u221a2)\n\nSo the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/(\u221a2)) ) * (-1)^{1+2} = (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/(\u221a2)) ) * (-1)^(3) = (1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2)\n\nWait, so the determinant is:\n\nFirst term: (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 )\n\nSecond term: (1/\u221a2) * [ minor determinant ] * (-1)^{1+2}.\n\nWait, the minor for (1,2) is:\n\nThe minor is the determinant of the submatrix when row 1 and column 2 are removed. So the submatrix is rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo it's:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[0, -\u03bb ]\n\nSo determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) )= -\u03bb/\u221a2.\n\nSo the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) * (-1)^{1+2} = (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) * (-1)^3 = (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) * (-1) = (1/\u221a2)( \u03bb/\u221a2 ) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) + (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) * (-1) \u2192 Wait, no, the expansion is:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb)*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (1/\u221a2)*[(-\u03bb/\u221a2)]*(-1) + 0.\n\nWait, no, the cofactor expansion is:\n\nsum_{j=1 to 3} a_{1j} * C_{1j}, where C is the cofactor.\n\nSo for j=1: a_{11}= -\u03bb, C_{11}= (+1) * M_{11} determinant.\n\nj=2: a_{12}= 1/\u221a2, C_{12}= (-1)^{1+2} * M_{12} determinant.\n\nj=3: a_{13}=0, so term is zero.\n\nSo M_{12} is the minor for (1,2), which is the submatrix:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow 3: [0, -\u03bb ]\n\nSo determinant M_{12} is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) )= -\u03bb/\u221a2.\n\nSo C_{12} = (-1)^{3} * (-\u03bb/\u221a2 )= (-1)*(-\u03bb/\u221a2 )= \u03bb/\u221a2.\n\nSo the term for j=2 is a_{12} * C_{12} = (1/\u221a2) * (\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) + (\u03bb/2 ) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2 )= -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nSo the equation is -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo P has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes for P are 1, 0, -1.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability of getting P=0. So I need to find the eigenvector(s) of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the projection of the initial state onto this eigenvector.\n\nBut wait, for each eigenvalue, the eigenvectors form a subspace. Since P is a 3x3 matrix with eigenvalue 0, the eigenspace may be more than one-dimensional. So I need to find all eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nLet's set up (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nEquation 1: (0)v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\nEquation 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nEquation 3: 0 v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\nSo from equation 1 and 3, v2 must be 0.\n\nFrom equation 2: v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, v3]^T, with v1 = -v3. Let v3 = t, then v1 = -t.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are t * [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, for any scalar t.\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T (up to a scalar multiple).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check: If I plug this vector into P, does it get multiplied by zero?\n\nLet me compute P * [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nFirst component: (0)(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + 0*(1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(-1) + (0)(0) + (1/\u221a2)(1) = (-1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2) )=0.\n\nThird component: (0)(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + 0*(1) = 0.\n\nYes, that works. So the eigenvector is [-1, 0, 1]^T, but we can normalize it if needed.\n\nNow, the initial state is given as [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about normalization. Let me check the norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nWait, but the problem statement says the state is (-1,2,1), without normalization. So perhaps I should proceed as if the state is not normalized, but I think in quantum mechanics, states are usually assumed to be normalized. So maybe the correct approach is to normalize the state.\n\nSo the normalized state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nNow, the eigenvector for P=0 is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T. Let me compute its norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ].\n\nNow, the probability of measuring P=0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |\u03c8> and the eigenvector of P=0.\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ] \u2022 (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ].\n\nWait, no: the eigenvector is [ -1; 0; 1 ], and the state is [ -1; 2; 1 ] multiplied by 1/sqrt(6).\n\nWait, the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ] \u00b7 (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ].\n\nSo it's (1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))) ) * [ (-1)(-1) + 2*0 + 1*1 ].\n\nCompute the dot product: (1) + 0 + (1) )= 2.\n\nSo the inner product is (2) / (sqrt(12)) ) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the probability is the square of the absolute value: (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nNow, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenvector of P=0, which is [ -1; 0; 1 ]^T, normalized as (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nNow, the next measurement is Q. The operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.\n\nSo the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.\n\nWe need the probability of getting Q=-1, given that the state is now the normalized eigenvector of P=0.\n\nWait, but when the state is |\u03c6> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, then to find the probability of measuring Q=-1, we can compute the inner product of |\u03c6> with the eigenvector of Q corresponding to -1, square it.\n\nLooking at Q's matrix:\n\nQ is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n\nThe eigenvector for eigenvalue -1 is [0, 0, 1]^T.\n\nSo the inner product between |\u03c6> and [0, 0, 1]^T is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1).\n\nSo the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute it.\n\nThe state after P=0 is |\u03c6> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nThe eigenvector for Q=-1 is e3 = [0; 0; 1].\n\nThe inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * ( -1 * 0 + 0 *0 + 1 *1 ) = (1/sqrt(2)) * 1 = 1/sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is |1/sqrt(2)|^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of measuring Q=-1, given that P=0, is 1/2.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The initial state after measuring P=0 is |\u03c6>, which is [ -1; 0; 1 ] normalized by 1/sqrt(2). So when we measure Q on this state, what are the possible outcomes?\n\nQ's eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors are e1, e2, e3.\n\nSo the projection of |\u03c6> onto e3 (Q=-1) is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1) * <e3 | \u03c6> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [0,0,1] \u00b7 [ -1; 0; 1 ] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (1) \u2192 so the amplitude is 1/sqrt(2), so probability is 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nWait, but wait. Because the state |\u03c6> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ], the components are:\n\nComponent along e1: (-1)/sqrt(2),\n\nComponent along e2: 0,\n\nComponent along e3: 1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo when measuring Q, the probabilities are the squares of these.\n\nSo P(Q=1) = [ (-1/sqrt(2))^2 ] = 1/2.\n\nP(Q=0) = 0.\n\nP(Q=-1) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because the sum of probabilities should be 1. Let me check: 1/2 (for 1) + 0 (for 0) + 1/2 (for -1) \u2192 sum is 1. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the state |\u03c6> has zero component in the e2 direction (second basis vector), which is the eigenvector for Q=0. So measuring Q in this state can't give 0. So the probabilities are 1/2 for Q=1 and 1/2 for Q=-1.\n\nSo the probability of getting Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nSo the overall probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when you measure P, the state collapses to |\u03c6>, and then the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2. So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are represented by vectors, usually column vectors, and these vectors need to be normalized. So I should probably check if this state is normalized. To do that, I'll calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let's compute the norm: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, right, so the norm is sqrt(6). So to get a unit vector, we should divide each component by sqrt(6). But wait, the problem doesn't mention normalization, so maybe the state isn't normalized. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, states are typically assumed to be normalized. I'll keep that in mind. Maybe the given state isn't normalized, but perhaps the operators are such that it doesn't matter for the probabilities? Or maybe I'm supposed to normalize it first.\n\nMoving on, the operators P and Q are given as square matrices. Let me write them down.\n\nOperator P's matrix:\nFirst row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\nSecond row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nThird row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nOperator Q's matrix:\nFirst row: [1, 0, 0]\nSecond row: [0, 0, 0]\nThird row: [0, 0, -1]\n\nWait, Q is a diagonal matrix. So its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. Because the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1. And when you measure Q, the possible results are these eigenvalues.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first, then Q. Wait, no, the order is Q just after P. So the measurements are done in the order P first, then Q. So I need to find the probability that when I measure P, I get 0, and then when I measure Q, I get -1.\n\nWait, but no, wait. The wording is a bit ambiguous. It says, \"the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements.\" So I think that means the first measurement is P, getting 0, and then the second measurement of Q, given that the state has collapsed to the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0. So I need to find the probability that P=0 and then, in that new state, Q=-1.\n\nWait, but the measurement of Q is after P, so the state after measuring P will be the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, in that state, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is what I need. So the overall probability is the product of the probability of P=0 and, given that P=0, the probability of Q=-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the joint probability, but I think in quantum mechanics, the measurements are sequential, so the second measurement is done on the state post the first measurement. So it's the product of the probabilities.\n\nBut wait, wait, another approach: perhaps the state is first measured in P, and then in Q. So the first step is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then compute the projection of the initial state onto that eigenvector. That gives the probability of getting 0 for P. Then, once you have that state, compute the probability of measuring Q=-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should compute the probability as the absolute square of the amplitude of the combined event. Hmm. Let's think.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\n2. Compute the projection of the initial state onto this eigenvector. The square of the absolute value of this projection gives the probability of measuring P=0.\n\n3. Once the state collapses to the eigenvector of P=0, compute the probability of measuring Q=-1.\n\n4. Multiply these two probabilities to get the desired probability.\n\nWait, but wait. No, the first part is the probability to get P=0, and then, given that, the probability to get Q=-1. So the total probability is the product of these two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state after measuring P=0 is the eigenvector (up to normalization). So I need to compute the projection, then compute the expectation for Q in that state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to calculate the probabilities in a different way. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I'll need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n\nSo operator P has the matrix:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nHmm. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I can observe the structure. Let me try to see if P is a Hermitian matrix, which it should be since it's an observable.\n\nLooking at P:\n\n- The elements are real, so it's symmetric if it's Hermitian. Wait, P's (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), (2,1) is 1/sqrt(2), so that's symmetric. Similarly, (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), (3,2) is 1/sqrt(2). So yes, P is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So eigenvalues are real.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P can be found by solving the characteristic equation.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think about the matrix. It looks like a tridiagonal matrix with zeros on the diagonal, and 1/sqrt(2) on the super and subdiagonals except for (2,3) and (3,2), which are 1/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, maybe it's a symmetric matrix with a specific structure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by noting that P^2 is a certain matrix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the eigenvalues.\n\nLet me write the matrix:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nSo, the characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nThe matrix P - \u03bb I is:\n\n[-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb]\n\nCalculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's proceed.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)*0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]\n\nSo expanding along the first row:\n\n= -\u03bb [ \u03bb^2 - (1/2) ] - (1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) ] + 0\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) + (1/\u221a2)( \u03bb / \u221a2 )\n\nSimplify the second term: (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2)\n\nSo the determinant equation becomes:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0\n\nFactor:\n\n\u03bb (-\u03bb^2 + 1) ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb^2 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0 or \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So P has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the determinant calculation, because I might have made a mistake.\n\nThe determinant is calculated as:\n\nFor the first row: element (1,1) is -\u03bb. The minor is the 2x2 matrix:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n[ 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nWhich has determinant ( (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) ) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nSo the first term is (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nThen, the second element in the first row is 1/\u221a2. The minor is the 2x2 matrix:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ]\n[0, -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, no, wait. The minor is the submatrix when you remove row 1 and column 2.\n\nSo the minor is:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo for element (1,2), the minor is:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nBut wait, columns 1 and 3. So for (1,2), the minor is:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ]\n[0, -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, no, because in the minor for (1,2), the rows are 2 and 3, and columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo row 2: columns 1 and 3 are 1/\u221a2 and 1/\u221a2.\n\nRow 3: columns 1 and 3 are 0 and -\u03bb.\n\nSo the minor matrix is:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[0, -\u03bb]\n\nThe determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) )= -\u03bb/(\u221a2)\n\nSo the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/(\u221a2)) ) * (-1)^{1+2} = (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/(\u221a2)) ) * (-1)^(3) = (1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2)\n\nWait, so the determinant is:\n\nFirst term: (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 )\n\nSecond term: (1/\u221a2) * [ minor determinant ] * (-1)^{1+2}.\n\nWait, the minor for (1,2) is:\n\nThe minor is the determinant of the submatrix when row 1 and column 2 are removed. So the submatrix is rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo it's:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[0, -\u03bb ]\n\nSo determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) )= -\u03bb/\u221a2.\n\nSo the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) * (-1)^{1+2} = (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) * (-1)^3 = (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) * (-1) = (1/\u221a2)( \u03bb/\u221a2 ) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) + (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) * (-1) \u2192 Wait, no, the expansion is:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb)*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (1/\u221a2)*[(-\u03bb/\u221a2)]*(-1) + 0.\n\nWait, no, the cofactor expansion is:\n\nsum_{j=1 to 3} a_{1j} * C_{1j}, where C is the cofactor.\n\nSo for j=1: a_{11}= -\u03bb, C_{11}= (+1) * M_{11} determinant.\n\nj=2: a_{12}= 1/\u221a2, C_{12}= (-1)^{1+2} * M_{12} determinant.\n\nj=3: a_{13}=0, so term is zero.\n\nSo M_{12} is the minor for (1,2), which is the submatrix:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow 3: [0, -\u03bb ]\n\nSo determinant M_{12} is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) )= -\u03bb/\u221a2.\n\nSo C_{12} = (-1)^{3} * (-\u03bb/\u221a2 )= (-1)*(-\u03bb/\u221a2 )= \u03bb/\u221a2.\n\nSo the term for j=2 is a_{12} * C_{12} = (1/\u221a2) * (\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) + (\u03bb/2 ) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2 )= -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nSo the equation is -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo P has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes for P are 1, 0, -1.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability of getting P=0. So I need to find the eigenvector(s) of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the projection of the initial state onto this eigenvector.\n\nBut wait, for each eigenvalue, the eigenvectors form a subspace. Since P is a 3x3 matrix with eigenvalue 0, the eigenspace may be more than one-dimensional. So I need to find all eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nLet's set up (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nEquation 1: (0)v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\nEquation 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nEquation 3: 0 v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\nSo from equation 1 and 3, v2 must be 0.\n\nFrom equation 2: v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, v3]^T, with v1 = -v3. Let v3 = t, then v1 = -t.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are t * [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, for any scalar t.\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T (up to a scalar multiple).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check: If I plug this vector into P, does it get multiplied by zero?\n\nLet me compute P * [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nFirst component: (0)(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + 0*(1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(-1) + (0)(0) + (1/\u221a2)(1) = (-1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2) )=0.\n\nThird component: (0)(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + 0*(1) = 0.\n\nYes, that works. So the eigenvector is [-1, 0, 1]^T, but we can normalize it if needed.\n\nNow, the initial state is given as [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about normalization. Let me check the norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nWait, but the problem statement says the state is (-1,2,1), without normalization. So perhaps I should proceed as if the state is not normalized, but I think in quantum mechanics, states are usually assumed to be normalized. So maybe the correct approach is to normalize the state.\n\nSo the normalized state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nNow, the eigenvector for P=0 is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T. Let me compute its norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ].\n\nNow, the probability of measuring P=0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |\u03c8> and the eigenvector of P=0.\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ] \u2022 (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ].\n\nWait, no: the eigenvector is [ -1; 0; 1 ], and the state is [ -1; 2; 1 ] multiplied by 1/sqrt(6).\n\nWait, the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ] \u00b7 (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ].\n\nSo it's (1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))) ) * [ (-1)(-1) + 2*0 + 1*1 ].\n\nCompute the dot product: (1) + 0 + (1) )= 2.\n\nSo the inner product is (2) / (sqrt(12)) ) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the probability is the square of the absolute value: (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nNow, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenvector of P=0, which is [ -1; 0; 1 ]^T, normalized as (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nNow, the next measurement is Q. The operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.\n\nSo the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.\n\nWe need the probability of getting Q=-1, given that the state is now the normalized eigenvector of P=0.\n\nWait, but when the state is |\u03c6> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, then to find the probability of measuring Q=-1, we can compute the inner product of |\u03c6> with the eigenvector of Q corresponding to -1, square it.\n\nLooking at Q's matrix:\n\nQ is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n\nThe eigenvector for eigenvalue -1 is [0, 0, 1]^T.\n\nSo the inner product between |\u03c6> and [0, 0, 1]^T is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1).\n\nSo the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute it.\n\nThe state after P=0 is |\u03c6> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nThe eigenvector for Q=-1 is e3 = [0; 0; 1].\n\nThe inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * ( -1 * 0 + 0 *0 + 1 *1 ) = (1/sqrt(2)) * 1 = 1/sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is |1/sqrt(2)|^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of measuring Q=-1, given that P=0, is 1/2.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The initial state after measuring P=0 is |\u03c6>, which is [ -1; 0; 1 ] normalized by 1/sqrt(2). So when we measure Q on this state, what are the possible outcomes?\n\nQ's eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors are e1, e2, e3.\n\nSo the projection of |\u03c6> onto e3 (Q=-1) is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1) * <e3 | \u03c6> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [0,0,1] \u00b7 [ -1; 0; 1 ] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (1) \u2192 so the amplitude is 1/sqrt(2), so probability is 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nWait, but wait. Because the state |\u03c6> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ], the components are:\n\nComponent along e1: (-1)/sqrt(2),\n\nComponent along e2: 0,\n\nComponent along e3: 1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo when measuring Q, the probabilities are the squares of these.\n\nSo P(Q=1) = [ (-1/sqrt(2))^2 ] = 1/2.\n\nP(Q=0) = 0.\n\nP(Q=-1) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because the sum of probabilities should be 1. Let me check: 1/2 (for 1) + 0 (for 0) + 1/2 (for -1) \u2192 sum is 1. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the state |\u03c6> has zero component in the e2 direction (second basis vector), which is the eigenvector for Q=0. So measuring Q in this state can't give 0. So the probabilities are 1/2 for Q=1 and 1/2 for Q=-1.\n\nSo the probability of getting Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nSo the overall probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when you measure P, the state collapses to |\u03c6>, and then the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2. So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the probability of measuring \\( P = 0 \\) and \\( Q = -1 \\) in sequence for a quantum system. The state of the system is given as \\( | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\), which is not normalized.

The characteristic equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-\\lambda^3 + \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\lambda (\\lambda^2 - 1) = 0 \\implies \\lambda = 0, \\pm 1.\n\\]\n\nThus, the eigenvalues of \\( P \\) are \\( 0, 1, -1 \\). For \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), the eigenvector is found by solving \\( P | \\phi \\rangle = 0 \\). The eigenvector corresponding to \\( \\lambda = 0 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n| \\phi_0 \\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThis eigenvector is not normalized, so it is normalized to:\n\n\\[\n| \\phi_0 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Probability of Measuring \\( P = 0 \\)\nThe probability of measuring \\( P = 0 \\) is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \\( | \\psi \\rangle \\) onto \\( | \\phi_0 \\rangle \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again and see what's being asked.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait. Wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should be normalized, right? So I need to check if this vector is normalized. Let's compute its magnitude. The elements are -1, 2, 1. So the magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is probably this divided by sqrt(6). Oh, but wait, maybe the problem already gives the state as a column vector, so perhaps I need to normalize it first before proceeding. Hmm, that's an important point. So I should write the state as |\u03c8> = 1/sqrt(6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nNext, there are two observables, P and Q, each represented by their respective matrices. The matrix for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that down. First row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, that's a symmetric matrix, but let me check if it's Hermitian because operators in QM should be Hermitian. Since all the elements are real and symmetric, yes, it's Hermitian.\n\nThe matrix for Q is diagonal: first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes when measuring Q are 1, 0, and -1.\n\nThe question is, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first, then Q. Wait, no, the question says measuring Q just after P. So the measurements are done in the order P then Q. So the process is: first measure P, get outcome 0, then measure Q, get outcome -1.\n\nWait, but wait, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So after measuring P and getting 0, the state becomes the eigenstate of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q on this new state will give us the probabilities for each outcome.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Because when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses to that eigenvector (up to a normalization factor).\n\n2. Compute the probability of getting 0 in the first measurement. Because the initial state is |\u03c8>, the probability is the square of the amplitude of the component of |\u03c8> in the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0.\n\n3. Once we have the eigenvector, we can see what the state is after the first measurement, and then compute the probability of measuring Q as -1 on this new state.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the initial state is |\u03c8>, and when you measure P, you project onto the eigenspace of P. If the eigenvalue 0 has a one-dimensional eigenspace (i.e., a single eigenvector up to scaling), then the probability is the square of the inner product between |\u03c8> and that eigenvector.\n\nSo first step: find the eigenvectors of P for eigenvalue 0.\n\nLet me write down the matrix P again. It's a 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\n0       1/\u221a2     0\n1/\u221a2    0       1/\u221a2\n0       1/\u221a2     0\n\nWe need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let's find the eigenvalues first by solving det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nThe determinant of:\n\n[-\u03bb   1/\u221a2     0 ]\n[1/\u221a2 -\u03bb    1/\u221a2 ]\n[0    1/\u221a2  -\u03bb ]\n\nHmm, let's compute this determinant.\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n-\u03bb * det [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * det [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 * something.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant by other means. Alternatively, since it's a 3x3 matrix, maybe it's symmetric, so perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues by considering the structure of P. Let's see. The matrix P seems to have a certain symmetry. Let me try to find the trace. The trace is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is 0.\n\nLooking for eigenvalues, perhaps 1, 1, -2? Wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are 1, -1, 0, but that would sum to zero, which matches the trace. Let's check.\n\nWait, let's compute the determinant for \u03bb=0. The determinant of P would be the determinant of the original matrix.\n\nCompute determinant of P:\n\nThe matrix is:\n\n0       1/\u221a2     0\n1/\u221a2    0       1/\u221a2\n0       1/\u221a2     0\n\nWe can compute this determinant using the rule for 3x3 matrices.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n0*(0*0 - 1/\u221a2 *1/\u221a2) - 1/\u221a2*(1/\u221a2*0 - 1/\u221a2 *0) + 0*(something)\n\nWait, expanding along the first row:\n\n= 0 * [ minor ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(0) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] + 0 * [ ... ]\n\nSo the first term is zero, the second term is (1/\u221a2) multiplied by (0 - 0) = 0, and the third term is zero. So determinant is zero. So \u03bb=0 is an eigenvalue.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0 and perhaps others. Let's find the other eigenvalues.\n\nAnother approach: since P is symmetric, it's diagonalizable, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal.\n\nLooking for eigenvectors when \u03bb=0.\n\nThe equation is (P - 0 I)|v> = 0 \u2192 P|v> = 0.\n\nSo for each component:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2=0 again.\n\nSo from first equation, v2=0. From third equation, v2=0. From second equation, v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. Let's set v3 = a, then v1 = -a. So the vector is (-a, 0, a). Or, simplified, (1, 0, -1) scaled by a.\n\nWait, but to make it a unit vector, we can write it as (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, let's check: (1)^2 + (0)^2 + (-1)^2 = 2 \u2192 norm is sqrt(2), so yes, we can write the eigenvector as (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but wait, another possibility is (1, 0, -1) scaled by 1/sqrt(2). Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1), but normalized.\n\nSo the eigenstate corresponding to \u03bb=0 is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.\n\nWait, but wait, when I computed the system for \u03bb=0, the equations were:\n\nv2 = 0,\n\nv1 + v3 = 0,\n\nv2 =0.\n\nSo any vector where v2=0 and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the general solution is v1 = a, v2=0, v3 = -a. So the eigenvectors are a*(1, 0, -1). So normalized, it's (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo that's the eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nNow, the initial state is |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6). So we can write this as |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) (-1, 2, 1)^T.\n\nThe probability of measuring 0 for P is the square of the amplitude of the projection of |\u03c8> onto |v0>.\n\nSo the amplitude is the inner product of |\u03c8> and |v0>.\n\nLet me compute this inner product:\n\n\u27e8v0 | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) \u00b7 ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )\n\n= [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + [ (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\n= [ (-1) / sqrt(12) ) ] + [ (-1)/sqrt(12) ) ]\n\n= (-2)/sqrt(12) )\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) as 2*sqrt(3), so this becomes (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3)\n\nSo the amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), so the probability is ( (-1/sqrt(3)) )^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of getting 0 when measuring P is 1/3.\n\nWait, but the question says the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So this is the first part. But only if the first measurement is 0, we proceed to measure Q on the new state.\n\nSo after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to |v0>, which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, we need to measure Q on this new state.\n\nThe operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.\n\nThe eigenstates of Q are the standard basis vectors, since Q is diagonal.\n\nSo |q1> = (1, 0, 0)^T,\n\n|q0> = (0, 1, 0)^T,\n\n|q-1> = (0, 0, 1)^T.\n\nSo the eigenstates are |q1>, |q0>, |q-1> for eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.\n\nNow, the state after the first measurement is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWe need to compute the probability of measuring -1 for Q. That would be the square of the inner product of |v0> and |q-1>.\n\nSo the amplitude is \u27e8 q-1 | v0 \u27e9 = (0, 0, 1) \u00b7 (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) = 0 + 0 + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)) ) = -1/sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is ( -1/sqrt(2) )^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of getting -1 for Q is 1/2.\n\nBut wait, but the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q, given that P was 0.\n\nSo the overall probability is P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 | P=0) = (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because when you condition on P=0, the state is |v0>, and in that state, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2. So the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. When you measure P first, the probability of getting 0 is 1/3. Then, in that scenario, the probability of getting -1 for Q is 1/2. So the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Q measurement. Let me double-check.\n\nThe state after P is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are the diagonal entries of Q. So when you express |v0> in terms of the eigenstates of Q, the coefficients are the amplitudes.\n\nSo |v0> can be written as:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) |q1> + 0 |q0> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |q-1>.\n\nSo the amplitude for |q-1> is -1/sqrt(2), so the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the probability is 1/2.\n\nSo the combined probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again and see what's being asked.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait. Wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should be normalized, right? So I need to check if this vector is normalized. Let's compute its magnitude. The elements are -1, 2, 1. So the magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is probably this divided by sqrt(6). Oh, but wait, maybe the problem already gives the state as a column vector, so perhaps I need to normalize it first before proceeding. Hmm, that's an important point. So I should write the state as |\u03c8> = 1/sqrt(6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nNext, there are two observables, P and Q, each represented by their respective matrices. The matrix for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that down. First row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, that's a symmetric matrix, but let me check if it's Hermitian because operators in QM should be Hermitian. Since all the elements are real and symmetric, yes, it's Hermitian.\n\nThe matrix for Q is diagonal: first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes when measuring Q are 1, 0, and -1.\n\nThe question is, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first, then Q. Wait, no, the question says measuring Q just after P. So the measurements are done in the order P then Q. So the process is: first measure P, get outcome 0, then measure Q, get outcome -1.\n\nWait, but wait, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So after measuring P and getting 0, the state becomes the eigenstate of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q on this new state will give us the probabilities for each outcome.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Because when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses to that eigenvector (up to a normalization factor).\n\n2. Compute the probability of getting 0 in the first measurement. Because the initial state is |\u03c8>, the probability is the square of the amplitude of the component of |\u03c8> in the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0.\n\n3. Once we have the eigenvector, we can see what the state is after the first measurement, and then compute the probability of measuring Q as -1 on this new state.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the initial state is |\u03c8>, and when you measure P, you project onto the eigenspace of P. If the eigenvalue 0 has a one-dimensional eigenspace (i.e., a single eigenvector up to scaling), then the probability is the square of the inner product between |\u03c8> and that eigenvector.\n\nSo first step: find the eigenvectors of P for eigenvalue 0.\n\nLet me write down the matrix P again. It's a 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\n0       1/\u221a2     0\n1/\u221a2    0       1/\u221a2\n0       1/\u221a2     0\n\nWe need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let's find the eigenvalues first by solving det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nThe determinant of:\n\n[-\u03bb   1/\u221a2     0 ]\n[1/\u221a2 -\u03bb    1/\u221a2 ]\n[0    1/\u221a2  -\u03bb ]\n\nHmm, let's compute this determinant.\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n-\u03bb * det [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * det [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 * something.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant by other means. Alternatively, since it's a 3x3 matrix, maybe it's symmetric, so perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues by considering the structure of P. Let's see. The matrix P seems to have a certain symmetry. Let me try to find the trace. The trace is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is 0.\n\nLooking for eigenvalues, perhaps 1, 1, -2? Wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are 1, -1, 0, but that would sum to zero, which matches the trace. Let's check.\n\nWait, let's compute the determinant for \u03bb=0. The determinant of P would be the determinant of the original matrix.\n\nCompute determinant of P:\n\nThe matrix is:\n\n0       1/\u221a2     0\n1/\u221a2    0       1/\u221a2\n0       1/\u221a2     0\n\nWe can compute this determinant using the rule for 3x3 matrices.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n0*(0*0 - 1/\u221a2 *1/\u221a2) - 1/\u221a2*(1/\u221a2*0 - 1/\u221a2 *0) + 0*(something)\n\nWait, expanding along the first row:\n\n= 0 * [ minor ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(0) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] + 0 * [ ... ]\n\nSo the first term is zero, the second term is (1/\u221a2) multiplied by (0 - 0) = 0, and the third term is zero. So determinant is zero. So \u03bb=0 is an eigenvalue.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0 and perhaps others. Let's find the other eigenvalues.\n\nAnother approach: since P is symmetric, it's diagonalizable, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal.\n\nLooking for eigenvectors when \u03bb=0.\n\nThe equation is (P - 0 I)|v> = 0 \u2192 P|v> = 0.\n\nSo for each component:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2=0 again.\n\nSo from first equation, v2=0. From third equation, v2=0. From second equation, v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. Let's set v3 = a, then v1 = -a. So the vector is (-a, 0, a). Or, simplified, (1, 0, -1) scaled by a.\n\nWait, but to make it a unit vector, we can write it as (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, let's check: (1)^2 + (0)^2 + (-1)^2 = 2 \u2192 norm is sqrt(2), so yes, we can write the eigenvector as (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but wait, another possibility is (1, 0, -1) scaled by 1/sqrt(2). Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1), but normalized.\n\nSo the eigenstate corresponding to \u03bb=0 is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.\n\nWait, but wait, when I computed the system for \u03bb=0, the equations were:\n\nv2 = 0,\n\nv1 + v3 = 0,\n\nv2 =0.\n\nSo any vector where v2=0 and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the general solution is v1 = a, v2=0, v3 = -a. So the eigenvectors are a*(1, 0, -1). So normalized, it's (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo that's the eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nNow, the initial state is |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6). So we can write this as |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) (-1, 2, 1)^T.\n\nThe probability of measuring 0 for P is the square of the amplitude of the projection of |\u03c8> onto |v0>.\n\nSo the amplitude is the inner product of |\u03c8> and |v0>.\n\nLet me compute this inner product:\n\n\u27e8v0 | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) \u00b7 ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )\n\n= [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + [ (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\n= [ (-1) / sqrt(12) ) ] + [ (-1)/sqrt(12) ) ]\n\n= (-2)/sqrt(12) )\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) as 2*sqrt(3), so this becomes (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3)\n\nSo the amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), so the probability is ( (-1/sqrt(3)) )^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of getting 0 when measuring P is 1/3.\n\nWait, but the question says the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So this is the first part. But only if the first measurement is 0, we proceed to measure Q on the new state.\n\nSo after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to |v0>, which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, we need to measure Q on this new state.\n\nThe operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.\n\nThe eigenstates of Q are the standard basis vectors, since Q is diagonal.\n\nSo |q1> = (1, 0, 0)^T,\n\n|q0> = (0, 1, 0)^T,\n\n|q-1> = (0, 0, 1)^T.\n\nSo the eigenstates are |q1>, |q0>, |q-1> for eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.\n\nNow, the state after the first measurement is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWe need to compute the probability of measuring -1 for Q. That would be the square of the inner product of |v0> and |q-1>.\n\nSo the amplitude is \u27e8 q-1 | v0 \u27e9 = (0, 0, 1) \u00b7 (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) = 0 + 0 + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)) ) = -1/sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is ( -1/sqrt(2) )^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of getting -1 for Q is 1/2.\n\nBut wait, but the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q, given that P was 0.\n\nSo the overall probability is P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 | P=0) = (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because when you condition on P=0, the state is |v0>, and in that state, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2. So the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. When you measure P first, the probability of getting 0 is 1/3. Then, in that scenario, the probability of getting -1 for Q is 1/2. So the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Q measurement. Let me double-check.\n\nThe state after P is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are the diagonal entries of Q. So when you express |v0> in terms of the eigenstates of Q, the coefficients are the amplitudes.\n\nSo |v0> can be written as:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) |q1> + 0 |q0> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |q-1>.\n\nSo the amplitude for |q-1> is -1/sqrt(2), so the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the probability is 1/2.\n\nSo the combined probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the quantum system described by the given state and observables.\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the initial state\nThe initial state is given as the column vector:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe norm of this vector is:\n\n\\[\n\\|\\psi\\| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the normalized state is:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the eigenvectors of \\(P\\) for eigenvalue \\(0\\)\nThe operator \\(P\\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the eigenvectors of \\(P\\) for eigenvalue \\(0\\), we solve \\((P - 0I)|v\\rangle = 0\\), which simplifies to \\(P|v\\rangle = 0\\).

Let me read it again.\n\nThe system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's probably a vector with components -1, 2, and 1. I should note that the vector needs to be normalized, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors. Let me check that: the magnitude squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is 1/sqrt(6) times (-1,2,1)^T. I should remember to normalize it later when calculating probabilities.\n\nThe operators for observables P and Q are given. Let me write down their matrices.\n\nOperator P has a matrix:\nFirst row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nSecond row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nThird row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nOperator Q has a matrix:\nFirst row: 1, 0, 0\nSecond row: 0, 0, 0\nThird row: 0, 0, -1\n\nThe question is about measuring Q after measuring P.

Wait, no: the question says \"the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements.\" So first measuring P gives 0, then measuring Q gives -1.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the order of measurements matters because measuring one observable affects the state for the next measurement. So first, measure P, then Q.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think: When you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first, the initial state is |\u03c8> = (-1,2,1)^T / sqrt(6). We measure P first. The possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. So I need to find the eigenvalues of operator P.\n\nWait, operator P is a 3x3 matrix.

The trace is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The determinant is a bit complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, looking at the matrix, it's symmetric, so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. That's helpful.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps P has some structure that allows me to find its eigenvalues more easily.

Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix can be thought of as a sum of outer products. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can guess the eigenvalues.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps P is a projection operator, but I don't think so.

Let me assume that (a, b, c) is an eigenvector, so P*(a,b,c)^T = \u03bb (a, b, c)^T.\n\nSo writing the equations:\n\nFrom first row:\n(1/\u221a2) * b = \u03bb a. (Equation 1)\n\nSecond row:\n(1/\u221a2) a + (1/\u221a2) c = \u03bb b. (Equation 2)\n\nThird row:\n(1/\u221a2) b = \u03bb c. (Equation 3)\n\nSo from equation 1: b = \u03bb a * sqrt(2).\n\nFrom equation 3: c = (b)/(\u03bb sqrt(2)) = (\u03bb a sqrt(2))/(\u03bb sqrt(2)) ) = a.\n\nSo c = a.\n\nSubstituting into equation 2: (1/\u221a2) a + (1/\u221a2) a = \u03bb b.\n\nBut since b = \u03bb a sqrt(2), substitute:\n\n( (1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2) ) a = \u03bb ( \u03bb a sqrt(2) )\n\nSimplify left side: (2/\u221a2) a = sqrt(2) a.\n\nRight side: \u03bb^2 a sqrt(2).\n\nSo sqrt(2) a = \u03bb^2 a sqrt(2).\n\nAssuming a \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by a sqrt(2):\n\n1 = \u03bb^2.\n\nSo \u03bb^2 = 1 \u2192 \u03bb = 1 or \u03bb = -1.\n\nWait, but wait, that's only two eigenvalues. But since the matrix is 3x3, there must be a third eigenvalue. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the equations. From equations 1 and 3, we have b = \u03bb a sqrt(2) and c = a.\n\nWait, but in the case where a=0, perhaps another eigenvector exists.\n\nWait, let's see. If a = 0, then from equation 1, b = 0. Then from equation 3, c = 0. But that gives the zero vector, which isn't valid. So a can't be zero unless the vector is zero, which isn't possible.\n\nSo perhaps the other eigenvalue is \u03bb = -1.\n\nWait, let me check for \u03bb = -1.\n\nIf \u03bb = -1, then from equation 1: b = (-1) * a * sqrt(2).\n\nFrom equation 3: c = a.\n\nSubstituting into equation 2: (1/\u221a2) a + (1/\u221a2) a = (-1) * b.\n\nWhich is (2/\u221a2) a = (-1) * (- a sqrt(2)).\n\nSimplify left side: sqrt(2) a.\n\nRight side: a sqrt(2).\n\nSo sqrt(2) a = sqrt(2) a \u2192 yes, holds for any a.\n\nSo \u03bb = 1 and \u03bb = -1 are possible. Wait, but earlier I thought that the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So if there are three eigenvalues, say 1, 1, and -2, then their sum is zero.\n\nWait, but according to my previous calculation, the possible eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So maybe I missed another possible solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the third eigenvalue is zero. Let me check that.\n\nIf \u03bb = 0, then equation 1: (1/\u221a2) b = 0 \u2192 b=0.\n\nEquation 3: (1/\u221a2) b = 0 \u2192 0 = 0.\n\nEquation 2: (1/\u221a2) a + (1/\u221a2) c = 0 \u2192 a + c = 0 \u2192 c = -a.\n\nSo the eigenvector would be (a, 0, -a)^T. For example, (1, 0, -1)^T is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the trace is zero, and 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Wait, earlier when I assumed \u03bb^2 =1, I found \u03bb=1 and \u03bb=-1. But then for \u03bb=0, the equations hold as well. So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo when you measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nThe question is about getting 0 for P. So the probability of measuring 0 when measuring P is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state in the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo I need to find the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then compute the inner product between the initial state and that eigenvector, and then square the absolute value to get the probability.\n\nFrom earlier, when \u03bb=0, the eigenvector is (a, 0, -a)^T. Let's choose a=1, so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1)^T.\n\nWait, but I should normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.\n\nSo let me write the initial state vector as |\u03c8> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).\n\nThe eigenvector for P=0 is |e0> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe amplitude is the inner product <e0|\u03c8>.\n\nCompute this inner product:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + (0) * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1.\n\nSo that's (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2/sqrt(2)) ) = -sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude: (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the initial state is ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6). Let me compute the inner product correctly.\n\nWait, |e0> is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2). So the inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + (0) * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( (-1/sqrt(2)) ) * (1/sqrt(6)) )\n\nWait, no: no, wait. |e0> is a row vector [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)], and |\u03c8> is a column vector [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + (0) * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( (-1/sqrt(2)) ) * (1/sqrt(6)) )\n\nWhich is:\n\n(-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )\n\n= [ -1 -1 ] / (sqrt(12)) )\n\n= (-2) / (2*sqrt(3)) )\n\n= -1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), and the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nNow, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to |e0>, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, we measure Q. The matrix for Q is diagonal: [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,-1]]. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nSo the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1.\n\nWe need the probability of getting -1 when measuring Q after P=0.\n\nWait, but the state after P=0 is |e0> = (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo to find the probability of Q=-1, we need the eigenvector of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1, then compute the inner product squared.\n\nThe eigenvectors for Q are the standard basis vectors because Q is diagonal.\n\nThe eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the eigenvector (0,0,1)^T.\n\nSo the amplitude is the inner product between |e0> and (0,0,1)^T.\n\nCompute this: (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + 0 *0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 = -1/sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is ( |-1/sqrt(2)| )^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, after measuring P=0, the state is |e0> = (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Q: 1, 0, -1.\n\nThe probability of each outcome is the square of the inner product between the state and the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nSo for eigenvalue 1, the eigenvector is (1,0,0)^T.\n\nThe inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (-1/sqrt(2))*0 = 1/sqrt(2).\n\nProbability: (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nFor eigenvalue 0, the eigenvector is (0,1,0)^T. The inner product is zero, so probability zero.\n\nFor eigenvalue -1, the eigenvector is (0,0,1)^T. The inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*0 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = -1/sqrt(2).\n\nProbability: (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the probabilities should add up to 1. Let me check.\n\nWait, the state |e0> is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). Its norm is sqrt( (1)^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 ) / sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) )= 1. So the state is correctly normalized.\n\nThe probabilities for Q=1 is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nFor Q=-1, same 1/2.\n\nBut that adds to 1, which is correct because the 0 eigenvalue has zero probability.\n\nSo the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nSo the combined probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) ) = 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because the initial measurement of P gives 0 with probability 1/3, and then Q is measured on that new state, giving -1 with probability 1/2. So the combined probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nSo the answer should be 1/6, which is option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's probably a vector with components -1, 2, and 1. I should note that the vector needs to be normalized, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors. Let me check that: the magnitude squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is 1/sqrt(6) times (-1,2,1)^T. I should remember to normalize it later when calculating probabilities.\n\nThe operators for observables P and Q are given. Let me write down their matrices.\n\nOperator P has a matrix:\nFirst row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nSecond row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nThird row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nOperator Q has a matrix:\nFirst row: 1, 0, 0\nSecond row: 0, 0, 0\nThird row: 0, 0, -1\n\nThe question is about measuring Q after measuring P. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.\n\nHmm, wait. Wait, no: the question says \"the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements.\" So first measuring P gives 0, then measuring Q gives -1.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the order of measurements matters because measuring one observable affects the state for the next measurement. So first, measure P, then Q.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think: When you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first, the initial state is |\u03c8> = (-1,2,1)^T / sqrt(6). We measure P first. The possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. So I need to find the eigenvalues of operator P.\n\nWait, operator P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:\n\nP = [ [0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n       [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n       [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] ]\n\nHmm, finding the eigenvalues of this matrix might be a bit tricky. Let me think. The trace is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The determinant is a bit complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, looking at the matrix, it's symmetric, so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. That's helpful.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps P has some structure that allows me to find its eigenvalues more easily. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it's a symmetric matrix where the diagonal elements are zero. The off-diagonal elements are 1/\u221a2 except for the (1,3) and (3,1) positions, which are zero. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix can be thought of as a sum of outer products. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can guess the eigenvalues.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps P is a projection operator, but I don't think so. Let me compute P^2 and see.\n\nP squared:\n\nFirst row: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] multiplied by each column.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute P^2. Let me compute P squared.\n\nP^2 = P multiplied by P.\n\nLet me compute each element:\n\nRow 1 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nColumn 1 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]^T.\n\nSo (P^2)[1,1] = 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, (P^2)[1,2] = 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should instead think about the eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues can be found by noting that P is a symmetric matrix, and perhaps it has rank 2 or something.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps P is the position or momentum operator in some basis, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues of P are 1, 1, and -2? Because the trace is 0, so 1 + 1 + (-2) = 0. Let me test that. Wait, let's compute the trace of P^2 to see if the sum of squares of eigenvalues is correct.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are 1, 1, and -2, but I need to verify.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to find the eigenvectors for P. Let me consider possible eigenvectors.\n\nWait, let's try to find an eigenvector with eigenvalue \u03bb. Let me assume that (a, b, c) is an eigenvector, so P*(a,b,c)^T = \u03bb (a, b, c)^T.\n\nSo writing the equations:\n\nFrom first row:\n(1/\u221a2) * b = \u03bb a.

(Equation 3)\n\nSo from equation 1: b = \u03bb a * sqrt(2).\n\nFrom equation 3: c = (b)/(\u03bb sqrt(2)) = (\u03bb a sqrt(2))/(\u03bb sqrt(2)) ) = a.\n\nSo c = a.\n\nSubstituting into equation 2: (1/\u221a2) a + (1/\u221a2) a = \u03bb b.\n\nBut since b = \u03bb a sqrt(2), substitute:\n\n( (1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2) ) a = \u03bb ( \u03bb a sqrt(2) )\n\nSimplify left side: (2/\u221a2) a = sqrt(2) a.\n\nRight side: \u03bb^2 a sqrt(2).\n\nSo sqrt(2) a = \u03bb^2 a sqrt(2).\n\nAssuming a \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by a sqrt(2):\n\n1 = \u03bb^2.\n\nSo \u03bb^2 = 1 \u2192 \u03bb = 1 or \u03bb = -1.\n\nWait, but wait, that's only two eigenvalues. But since the matrix is 3x3, there must be a third eigenvalue. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the equations. From equations 1 and 3, we have b = \u03bb a sqrt(2) and c = a.\n\nWait, but in the case where a=0, perhaps another eigenvector exists.\n\nWait, let's see. If a = 0, then from equation 1, b = 0. Then from equation 3, c = 0. But that gives the zero vector, which isn't valid. So a can't be zero unless the vector is zero, which isn't possible.\n\nSo perhaps the other eigenvalue is \u03bb = -1.\n\nWait, let me check for \u03bb = -1.\n\nIf \u03bb = -1, then from equation 1: b = (-1) * a * sqrt(2).\n\nFrom equation 3: c = a.\n\nSubstituting into equation 2: (1/\u221a2) a + (1/\u221a2) a = (-1) * b.\n\nWhich is (2/\u221a2) a = (-1) * (- a sqrt(2)).\n\nSimplify left side: sqrt(2) a.\n\nRight side: a sqrt(2).\n\nSo sqrt(2) a = sqrt(2) a \u2192 yes, holds for any a.\n\nSo \u03bb = 1 and \u03bb = -1 are possible. Wait, but earlier I thought that the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So if there are three eigenvalues, say 1, 1, and -2, then their sum is zero.\n\nWait, but according to my previous calculation, the possible eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So maybe I missed another possible solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the third eigenvalue is zero. Let me check that.\n\nIf \u03bb = 0, then equation 1: (1/\u221a2) b = 0 \u2192 b=0.\n\nEquation 3: (1/\u221a2) b = 0 \u2192 0 = 0.\n\nEquation 2: (1/\u221a2) a + (1/\u221a2) c = 0 \u2192 a + c = 0 \u2192 c = -a.\n\nSo the eigenvector would be (a, 0, -a)^T. For example, (1, 0, -1)^T is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the trace is zero, and 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Wait, earlier when I assumed \u03bb^2 =1, I found \u03bb=1 and \u03bb=-1. But then for \u03bb=0, the equations hold as well. So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo when you measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nThe question is about getting 0 for P. So the probability of measuring 0 when measuring P is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state in the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo I need to find the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then compute the inner product between the initial state and that eigenvector, and then square the absolute value to get the probability.\n\nFrom earlier, when \u03bb=0, the eigenvector is (a, 0, -a)^T. Let's choose a=1, so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1)^T.\n\nWait, but I should normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.\n\nSo let me write the initial state vector as |\u03c8> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).\n\nThe eigenvector for P=0 is |e0> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe amplitude is the inner product <e0|\u03c8>.\n\nCompute this inner product:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + (0) * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1.\n\nSo that's (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2/sqrt(2)) ) = -sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude: (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the initial state is ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6). Let me compute the inner product correctly.\n\nWait, |e0> is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2). So the inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + (0) * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( (-1/sqrt(2)) ) * (1/sqrt(6)) )\n\nWait, no: no, wait. |e0> is a row vector [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)], and |\u03c8> is a column vector [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + (0) * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( (-1/sqrt(2)) ) * (1/sqrt(6)) )\n\nWhich is:\n\n(-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )\n\n= [ -1 -1 ] / (sqrt(12)) )\n\n= (-2) / (2*sqrt(3)) )\n\n= -1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), and the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nNow, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to |e0>, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, we measure Q. The matrix for Q is diagonal: [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,-1]]. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nSo the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1.\n\nWe need the probability of getting -1 when measuring Q after P=0.\n\nWait, but the state after P=0 is |e0> = (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo to find the probability of Q=-1, we need the eigenvector of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1, then compute the inner product squared.\n\nThe eigenvectors for Q are the standard basis vectors because Q is diagonal.\n\nThe eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the eigenvector (0,0,1)^T.\n\nSo the amplitude is the inner product between |e0> and (0,0,1)^T.\n\nCompute this: (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + 0 *0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 = -1/sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is ( |-1/sqrt(2)| )^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, after measuring P=0, the state is |e0> = (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Q: 1, 0, -1.\n\nThe probability of each outcome is the square of the inner product between the state and the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nSo for eigenvalue 1, the eigenvector is (1,0,0)^T.\n\nThe inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (-1/sqrt(2))*0 = 1/sqrt(2).\n\nProbability: (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nFor eigenvalue 0, the eigenvector is (0,1,0)^T. The inner product is zero, so probability zero.\n\nFor eigenvalue -1, the eigenvector is (0,0,1)^T. The inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*0 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = -1/sqrt(2).\n\nProbability: (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the probabilities should add up to 1. Let me check.\n\nWait, the state |e0> is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). Its norm is sqrt( (1)^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 ) / sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) )= 1. So the state is correctly normalized.\n\nThe probabilities for Q=1 is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nFor Q=-1, same 1/2.\n\nBut that adds to 1, which is correct because the 0 eigenvalue has zero probability.\n\nSo the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nSo the combined probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) ) = 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because the initial measurement of P gives 0 with probability 1/3, and then Q is measured on that new state, giving -1 with probability 1/2. So the combined probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nSo the answer should be 1/6, which is option D.\n\n\nThe problem involves a quantum system with an initial state vector \\( |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} / \\sqrt{6} \\), and two observables \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) represented by their respective matrices.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. The system's state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, actually, the state is a column vector with components (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, but wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors with complex numbers, but I guess here we'll proceed with the given vectors.\n\nThe operators P and Q are given as square matrices. Let me write them down.\n\nOperator P's matrix:\nFirst row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nSecond row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nThird row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nOperator Q's matrix:\nFirst row: 1, 0, 0\nSecond row: 0, 0, 0\nThird row: 0, 0, -1\n\nThe question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q just after measuring P.\n\nWait, I think the measurements are done in the order P first, then Q. But the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. It says, \"if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P\"\u2014so the order is P first, then Q. So the system's state will collapse after each measurement.\n\nBut wait, wait. Alternatively, sometimes in these problems, the measurements are considered in the reverse order. Like, if you measure Q after P, does that mean you first apply P, then Q? Or is it that the measurements are done one after the other, each collapsing the state?\n\nWait, I think I need to think about this. So the system starts in state |\u03c8> = [-1; 2; 1]. Then, P is measured, and then Q is measured on the resulting state.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the problem says \"the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements.\" So, the first measurement is P, giving 0, then the second measurement is Q, giving -1.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. Measure P. The system's state collapses to an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\n2. Then, measure Q on this new state. The probability of getting -1 is then calculated.\n\nBut wait, another thought: Alternatively, since the measurements are in sequence, perhaps the overall probability is the product of the probability of P=0 and then Q=-1 given that P=0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of both operators, determine the projections, and compute the probabilities accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P.\n\n2. Determine the eigenvector(s) corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of P. Because when you measure P and get 0, the state collapses to that eigenvector.\n\n3. Once the state is projected onto the P=0 eigenvector, apply the Q operator to this new state and find the probability of measuring Q=-1.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the probability of measuring P=0 first, and then, given that, the probability of measuring Q=-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial state is projected onto the eigenspace of P=0, and then Q is measured on that projected state.\n\nLet me start by analyzing operator P.\n\nOperator P's matrix:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nI need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit involved, but perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo let's compute the determinant of (P - \u03bb I):\n\n| -\u03bb     1/\u221a2      0     |\n| 1/\u221a2   -\u03bb      1/\u221a2  |\n| 0      1/\u221a2    -\u03bb    |\n\nWait, no. Wait, the matrix P is:\n\n[ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n  [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],\n  [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]\n\nSo, P - \u03bb I would be:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ],\n[1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ]\n\nNow, the determinant of this matrix is:\n\n| -\u03bb        1/\u221a2         0      |\n|1/\u221a2      -\u03bb         1/\u221a2  |\n|0         1/\u221a2       -\u03bb     |\n\nCalculating the determinant:\n\nExpand along the first row.\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * something.\n\nSo, first term: -\u03bb [ \u03bb^2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb / sqrt(2)) - 0 ] = -(1/\u221a2)( -\u03bb / sqrt(2) ) ) = -(1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb) / 2\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb^2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) + \u03bb/2\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb (1/2 + 1/2 )\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb (1) \n\nSo determinant equation is:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb( -\u03bb^2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb^2 ) =0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo, for eigenvalue 0, we can find the eigenvector.\n\nSo, solving (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 \u2192 P |v> = 0.\n\nSo, the system is:\n\nRow 1: 0 v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/sqrt(2) = 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nRow 3: 0 v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 same as row 1, which gives v2=0.\n\nSo, from row 1, v2=0. From row 2, v1 = -v3. So the eigenvector can be written as (v1, 0, -v1). Let's choose v1 =1, so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). But wait, because when you apply P, you have to normalize it.\n\nWait, let me write it as |v> = [a; 0; b], with a = -b.\n\nBut wait, in row 2, (1/sqrt(2)) a + (1/sqrt(2)) b =0 \u2192 a + b =0 \u2192 a = -b.\n\nSo, the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is any vector of the form (a, 0, -a). So, for example, choosing a=1, the vector is (1,0,-1), but it's not normalized yet.\n\nWait, but let's compute the norm: sqrt(1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the eigenvector for P=0 is |\u03c8_p0> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, the eigenvector for P=0 is [a; 0; -a]. So, for example, if a=1, the vector is [1; 0; -1], and when normalized, it's [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nSo, that's the state after measuring P and getting 0.\n\nNow, the initial state is |\u03c8> = [-1; 2; 1]. Let me compute the probability of getting P=0.\n\nThe probability is | <\u03c8_p0 | \u03c8> |^2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you measure an observable, the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenspace.\n\nIn this case, the eigenspace for P=0 is the one-dimensional space spanned by |\u03c8_p0>.\n\nSo, the probability P is | <\u03c8_p0 | \u03c8> |^2.\n\nCompute this inner product.\n\nSo, \u03c8 is [-1; 2; 1].\n\n\u03c8_p0 is [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2/sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2).\n\nThe absolute value squared is | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nBut wait, the initial state vector has a norm. Let me compute the norm of \u03c8.\n\nThe norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1+4+1)= sqrt(6). So, the state is not normalized. So, perhaps I should normalize it first.\n\nWait, the initial state is given as a column vector [-1, 2, 1]. Its norm is sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So, the normalized state is |\u03c8> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says the state is (-1, 2, 1), but I'm not sure if it's normalized. So, perhaps I need to normalize it before proceeding. Because in quantum mechanics, states are typically normalized.\n\nSo, the initial state is |\u03c8> = [ -1; 2; 1 ] / sqrt(6).\n\nSo, let's compute the inner product of |\u03c8_p0> and |\u03c8>.\n\n\u03c8_p0 is [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nSo, <\u03c8_p0 | \u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(6)) )\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\n= [ -1/(sqrt(12)) ) ] * 2 = [ -2/(sqrt(12)) ) ].\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) as 2*sqrt(3). So, 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nBut wait, the calculation:\n\nEach term is -1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = -1/(sqrt(12))= -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSo, two such terms: 2 * (-1/(2*sqrt(3))) )= -1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the absolute value squared is | -1/sqrt(3) |^2 = (1/3).\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nWait, but that's only the first part. Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |\u03c8_p0>, which is [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nNow, we measure Q on this new state. The operator Q has the matrix:\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 0\n\nRow 2: 0, 0, 0\n\nRow 3: 0, 0, -1\n\nSo, the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, and -1.\n\nBut wait, let's find the eigenvalues of Q.\n\nThe matrix Q is diagonal except for the second row and column, which are zero.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are the diagonal elements. Because the matrix is diagonal except for the middle element, which is zero. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, and -1.\n\nWait, no: the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are the diagonal elements. So, the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, and -1.\n\nWait, but the matrix is:\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 -1\n\nSo, yes, the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nSo, when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.\n\nBut the question asks for the probability of getting Q=-1 after measuring P=0.\n\nSo, after the state has collapsed to |\u03c8_p0> = [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)], we need to find the probability of getting Q=-1.\n\nSo, find the eigenvector of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1.\n\nLooking at Q's matrix:\n\nThe eigenvectors for Q are along the standard basis vectors because it's diagonal.\n\nFor eigenvalue 1: the eigenvector is [1; 0; 0].\n\nFor eigenvalue 0: [0; 1; 0].\n\nFor eigenvalue -1: [0; 0; 1].\n\nSo, the eigenvector for Q=-1 is |q_-1> = [0; 0; 1].\n\nWait, but let me confirm. When you apply Q to |q_-1>, you get -1 times |q_-1>, so yes.\n\nSo, the projection of |\u03c8_p0> onto |q_-1> is the inner product of |q_-1> and |\u03c8_p0>.\n\nSo, compute <q_-1 | \u03c8_p0>.\n\n|q_-1> is [0; 0; 1], so the inner product is 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)) )= -1/sqrt(2).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/2). So the probability is 1/2.\n\nWait, but that would be the probability of measuring Q=-1 given that the state is |\u03c8_p0>.\n\nSo, the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of the two independent measurements.\n\nWait, no. Because the first measurement (P=0) has a probability of 1/3, and then given that, the second measurement (Q=-1) has a probability of 1/2. So the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recheck.\n\nThe initial state is |\u03c8> = [-1; 2; 1]/sqrt(6).\n\nThe probability of P=0 is 1/3.\n\nAfter measuring P=0, the state is |\u03c8_p0> = [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nNow, when measuring Q, the probability of Q=-1 is the square of the amplitude of |q_-1> in |\u03c8_p0>.\n\nSo, the inner product is <q_-1 | \u03c8_p0> = [0 0 1] * [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)] = -1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the probability is | -1/sqrt(2) |^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo, the overall probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n\nWait, but I should double-check whether the initial state was correctly normalized.\n\nWait, the initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1). The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 )= sqrt(1+4+1)= sqrt(6). So, yes, the normalized state is (-1, 2, 1)/sqrt(6).\n\nSo, the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3, and given that, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2. So the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D) 1/6.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. The system's state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, actually, the state is a column vector with components (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, but wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors with complex numbers, but I guess here we'll proceed with the given vectors.\n\nThe operators P and Q are given as square matrices. Let me write them down.\n\nOperator P's matrix:\nFirst row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nSecond row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nThird row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nOperator Q's matrix:\nFirst row: 1, 0, 0\nSecond row: 0, 0, 0\nThird row: 0, 0, -1\n\nThe question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q just after measuring P.\n\nWait, I think the measurements are done in the order P first, then Q. But the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. It says, \"if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P\"\u2014so the order is P first, then Q. So the system's state will collapse after each measurement.\n\nBut wait, wait. Alternatively, sometimes in these problems, the measurements are considered in the reverse order. Like, if you measure Q after P, does that mean you first apply P, then Q? Or is it that the measurements are done one after the other, each collapsing the state?\n\nWait, I think I need to think about this. So the system starts in state |\u03c8> = [-1; 2; 1]. Then, P is measured, and then Q is measured on the resulting state.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the problem says \"the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements.\" So, the first measurement is P, giving 0, then the second measurement is Q, giving -1.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. Measure P. The system's state collapses to an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\n2. Then, measure Q on this new state. The probability of getting -1 is then calculated.\n\nBut wait, another thought: Alternatively, since the measurements are in sequence, perhaps the overall probability is the product of the probability of P=0 and then Q=-1 given that P=0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of both operators, determine the projections, and compute the probabilities accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P.\n\n2. Determine the eigenvector(s) corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of P. Because when you measure P and get 0, the state collapses to that eigenvector.\n\n3. Once the state is projected onto the P=0 eigenvector, apply the Q operator to this new state and find the probability of measuring Q=-1.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the probability of measuring P=0 first, and then, given that, the probability of measuring Q=-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial state is projected onto the eigenspace of P=0, and then Q is measured on that projected state.\n\nLet me start by analyzing operator P.\n\nOperator P's matrix:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nI need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit involved, but perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo let's compute the determinant of (P - \u03bb I):\n\n| -\u03bb     1/\u221a2      0     |\n| 1/\u221a2   -\u03bb      1/\u221a2  |\n| 0      1/\u221a2    -\u03bb    |\n\nWait, no. Wait, the matrix P is:\n\n[ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n  [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],\n  [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]\n\nSo, P - \u03bb I would be:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ],\n[1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ]\n\nNow, the determinant of this matrix is:\n\n| -\u03bb        1/\u221a2         0      |\n|1/\u221a2      -\u03bb         1/\u221a2  |\n|0         1/\u221a2       -\u03bb     |\n\nCalculating the determinant:\n\nExpand along the first row.\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * something.\n\nSo, first term: -\u03bb [ \u03bb^2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb / sqrt(2)) - 0 ] = -(1/\u221a2)( -\u03bb / sqrt(2) ) ) = -(1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb) / 2\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb^2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) + \u03bb/2\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb (1/2 + 1/2 )\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb (1) \n\nSo determinant equation is:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb( -\u03bb^2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb^2 ) =0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo, for eigenvalue 0, we can find the eigenvector.\n\nSo, solving (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 \u2192 P |v> = 0.\n\nSo, the system is:\n\nRow 1: 0 v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/sqrt(2) = 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nRow 3: 0 v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 same as row 1, which gives v2=0.\n\nSo, from row 1, v2=0. From row 2, v1 = -v3. So the eigenvector can be written as (v1, 0, -v1). Let's choose v1 =1, so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). But wait, because when you apply P, you have to normalize it.\n\nWait, let me write it as |v> = [a; 0; b], with a = -b.\n\nBut wait, in row 2, (1/sqrt(2)) a + (1/sqrt(2)) b =0 \u2192 a + b =0 \u2192 a = -b.\n\nSo, the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is any vector of the form (a, 0, -a). So, for example, choosing a=1, the vector is (1,0,-1), but it's not normalized yet.\n\nWait, but let's compute the norm: sqrt(1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the eigenvector for P=0 is |\u03c8_p0> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, the eigenvector for P=0 is [a; 0; -a]. So, for example, if a=1, the vector is [1; 0; -1], and when normalized, it's [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nSo, that's the state after measuring P and getting 0.\n\nNow, the initial state is |\u03c8> = [-1; 2; 1]. Let me compute the probability of getting P=0.\n\nThe probability is | <\u03c8_p0 | \u03c8> |^2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you measure an observable, the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenspace.\n\nIn this case, the eigenspace for P=0 is the one-dimensional space spanned by |\u03c8_p0>.\n\nSo, the probability P is | <\u03c8_p0 | \u03c8> |^2.\n\nCompute this inner product.\n\nSo, \u03c8 is [-1; 2; 1].\n\n\u03c8_p0 is [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2/sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2).\n\nThe absolute value squared is | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nBut wait, the initial state vector has a norm. Let me compute the norm of \u03c8.\n\nThe norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1+4+1)= sqrt(6). So, the state is not normalized. So, perhaps I should normalize it first.\n\nWait, the initial state is given as a column vector [-1, 2, 1]. Its norm is sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So, the normalized state is |\u03c8> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says the state is (-1, 2, 1), but I'm not sure if it's normalized. So, perhaps I need to normalize it before proceeding. Because in quantum mechanics, states are typically normalized.\n\nSo, the initial state is |\u03c8> = [ -1; 2; 1 ] / sqrt(6).\n\nSo, let's compute the inner product of |\u03c8_p0> and |\u03c8>.\n\n\u03c8_p0 is [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nSo, <\u03c8_p0 | \u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(6)) )\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\n= [ -1/(sqrt(12)) ) ] * 2 = [ -2/(sqrt(12)) ) ].\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) as 2*sqrt(3). So, 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nBut wait, the calculation:\n\nEach term is -1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = -1/(sqrt(12))= -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSo, two such terms: 2 * (-1/(2*sqrt(3))) )= -1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the absolute value squared is | -1/sqrt(3) |^2 = (1/3).\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nWait, but that's only the first part. Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |\u03c8_p0>, which is [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nNow, we measure Q on this new state. The operator Q has the matrix:\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 0\n\nRow 2: 0, 0, 0\n\nRow 3: 0, 0, -1\n\nSo, the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, and -1.\n\nBut wait, let's find the eigenvalues of Q.\n\nThe matrix Q is diagonal except for the second row and column, which are zero.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are the diagonal elements. Because the matrix is diagonal except for the middle element, which is zero. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, and -1.\n\nWait, no: the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are the diagonal elements. So, the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, and -1.\n\nWait, but the matrix is:\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 -1\n\nSo, yes, the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nSo, when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.\n\nBut the question asks for the probability of getting Q=-1 after measuring P=0.\n\nSo, after the state has collapsed to |\u03c8_p0> = [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)], we need to find the probability of getting Q=-1.\n\nSo, find the eigenvector of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1.\n\nLooking at Q's matrix:\n\nThe eigenvectors for Q are along the standard basis vectors because it's diagonal.\n\nFor eigenvalue 1: the eigenvector is [1; 0; 0].\n\nFor eigenvalue 0: [0; 1; 0].\n\nFor eigenvalue -1: [0; 0; 1].\n\nSo, the eigenvector for Q=-1 is |q_-1> = [0; 0; 1].\n\nWait, but let me confirm. When you apply Q to |q_-1>, you get -1 times |q_-1>, so yes.\n\nSo, the projection of |\u03c8_p0> onto |q_-1> is the inner product of |q_-1> and |\u03c8_p0>.\n\nSo, compute <q_-1 | \u03c8_p0>.\n\n|q_-1> is [0; 0; 1], so the inner product is 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)) )= -1/sqrt(2).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/2). So the probability is 1/2.\n\nWait, but that would be the probability of measuring Q=-1 given that the state is |\u03c8_p0>.\n\nSo, the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of the two independent measurements.\n\nWait, no. Because the first measurement (P=0) has a probability of 1/3, and then given that, the second measurement (Q=-1) has a probability of 1/2. So the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recheck.\n\nThe initial state is |\u03c8> = [-1; 2; 1]/sqrt(6).\n\nThe probability of P=0 is 1/3.\n\nAfter measuring P=0, the state is |\u03c8_p0> = [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nNow, when measuring Q, the probability of Q=-1 is the square of the amplitude of |q_-1> in |\u03c8_p0>.\n\nSo, the inner product is <q_-1 | \u03c8_p0> = [0 0 1] * [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)] = -1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the probability is | -1/sqrt(2) |^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo, the overall probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n\nWait, but I should double-check whether the initial state was correctly normalized.\n\nWait, the initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1). The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 )= sqrt(1+4+1)= sqrt(6). So, yes, the normalized state is (-1, 2, 1)/sqrt(6).\n\nSo, the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3, and given that, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2. So the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D) 1/6.\n\n\nThe problem involves measuring two observables, \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), in sequence on a quantum system. The system's initial state is given as \\( |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\), which is not normalized.
