      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific outcome. Alright, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by operators, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of those operators.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector in a 3-dimensional space. I think that's our state vector \u03c8. Oh wait, but I should probably normalize it first because probabilities depend on the norm. So I need to check if this vector is normalized.\n\nLet me calculate the norm squared. The components are -1, 2, 1. So the squares are 1, 4, and 1. Adding them up gives 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), meaning the state isn't normalized. So the actual state should be \u03c8 divided by sqrt(6), right? Because in quantum mechanics, states are typically represented as unit vectors. So the state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nNext, the observable is given by matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix. I need to find the probability that measuring P yields 0.\n\nWait, but how do we find that? Oh right, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. So I should find the eigenvalues of P. Because the measurement outcome will be an eigenvalue, and the probability is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's component in the state.\n\nSo let's find the eigenvalues of P. To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nLet me write down matrix P. So,\n\nP = [ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n       [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],\n       [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]\n\nSo the matrix looks like it's symmetric, which is good because symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. That should make things easier.\n\nThe characteristic equation is determinant of (P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo, let's compute the determinant:\n\n| -\u03bb    1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2  -\u03bb     1/\u221a2 |\n|0     1/\u221a2    -\u03bb    |\n\nHmm, calculating this determinant. Maybe expanding along the first row.\n\nThe determinant would be -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (0)(1/\u221a2) ) ] + 0 * something.\n\nWait, let me do it step by step.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (0)(something) ) ] \n+ 0 * [ ... ]\n\nSo, simplifying each term.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb * (\u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) )\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * ( - \u03bb / \u221a2 )\n\nWhich is - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb /\u221a2 ) = (\u03bb) / (2 )\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nDeterminant = (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2 )\n\nExpanding the first term: -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) + \u03bb/2\n\nSo:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor out \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb (-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1) = 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, and -\u03bb\u00b2 +1=0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 and \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability of getting 0. So we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0 and then find the projection of the state onto this eigenvector.\n\nSo let's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the system is:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(v1 + v3) =0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nThird equation: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0 v3 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSo from the first equation, v2=0. From the third equation, same thing.\n\nSo the eigenvectors must satisfy v2=0, and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) = v1 (1, 0, -1).\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1), but we should normalize it.\n\nThe norm squared is 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check that. Wait, when \u03bb=0, the eigenvectors are all vectors (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. So the eigenspace is two-dimensional? Wait no, because the solution only gives a one-dimensional eigenspace. Because the system reduces to v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, not two. So the eigenvalue 0 has multiplicity 1.\n\nWait, but the characteristic equation had -\u03bb\u00b3 +\u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2-1)=0 \u2192 \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1. So each is a simple root, so each eigenspace is one-dimensional.\n\nSo the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is (1, 0, -1) up to a scalar. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, let me check the normalization again: (1)^2 + (-1)^2 = 2, so sqrt(2) is the norm. So yes, normalized.\n\nSo now, the state vector \u03c8 is (-1, 2, 1) divided by sqrt(6). So \u03c8 = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nWe need to find the projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenvector for \u03bb=0. Because the probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude.\n\nThe amplitude is the inner product of \u03c8 and the eigenvector.\n\nLet me compute the inner product. The eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo inner product = [ (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] + [ (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 ] + [ (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nThird term: (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSo adding the two terms: (-1/(2\u221a3)) + (-1/(2\u221a3)) ) = (-2)/(2\u221a3) ) = (-1)/\u221a3.\n\nThe middle term is zero.\n\nSo the amplitude is (-1)/\u221a3. The probability is the square of the absolute value. So (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.\n",

So yes, normalized.\n\nSo now, the state vector \u03c8 is (-1, 2, 1) divided by sqrt(6). So \u03c8 = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nWe need to find the projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenvector for \u03bb=0. Because the probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude.\n\nThe amplitude is the inner product of \u03c8 and the eigenvector.\n\nLet me compute the inner product. The eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo inner product = [ (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] + [ (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 ] + [ (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nThird term: (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSo adding the two terms: (-1/(2\u221a3)) + (-1/(2\u221a3)) ) = (-2)/(2\u221a3) ) = (-1)/\u221a3.\n\nThe middle term is zero.\n\nSo the amplitude is (-1)/\u221a3. The probability is the square of the absolute value. So (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) and obtaining the outcome \\( 0 \\). The state of the system is given as \\( \\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is not normalized.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The state of the system is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait, no, actually, looking again, it's the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3x1 vector, right? So the system is in a three-dimensional state space.\n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). I need to find the probability that measuring this observable will yield 0 at time t.\n\nWait, okay, so in quantum mechanics, when you have an observable represented by a matrix, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that matrix. So first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the probability of getting a particular outcome is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.\n\nAlternatively, if P is a projection operator, maybe it's a bit different. Let me think. Oh, wait, I think P here is the observable itself, so its eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes.\n\nBut wait, looking at matrix P. Let me write it out to see its structure.\n\nP matrix:\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nHmm, this looks like a symmetric matrix. Symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues, so that's good.\n\nNow, the state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1, 2, 1). Let's call this vector \u03c8. So \u03c8 = [-1; 2; 1].\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically normalized. Let me check if \u03c8 is normalized. The norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of its components. So (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state isn't normalized. Oh, right, because in quantum mechanics, the state should be a unit vector. So maybe I need to normalize \u03c8.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't mention normalization. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed without normalizing, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the given state is already normalized, but in this case, it's not. So maybe I should normalize it before proceeding.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me think. The observable is P, and the state is \u03c8. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue \u03bb is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \u03c8 and the corresponding eigenvector of P. But to compute that, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think about the structure of matrix P. Let me see:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n]\n\nThis looks like a tridiagonal matrix, but with 0s on the diagonal except for the middle which is 0 again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues of P by solving the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo let's set up the matrix (P - \u03bb I):\n\nRow 1: [-\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2    -\u03bb      1/\u221a2    |\n| 0      1/\u221a2     -\u03bb     |\n\nCalculating this determinant. Let me try expanding along the first row.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] )\n- 1/\u221a2 * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] )\n+ 0 * something.\n\nSo first term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] \n= -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: -1/\u221a2 * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] \n= -1/\u221a2 * [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) - 0 ]\n= -1/\u221a2 * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) \n= (\u03bb) / 2 \n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo overall, determinant = -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2)\n\nSet determinant to zero:\n\n-\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0\n\nFactor out \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb [ - (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + 1/2 ] = 0\n\nSo either \u03bb=0, or [ - (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + 1/2 ] =0.\n\nLet me compute the second part:\n\n- (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + 1/2 = -\u03bb\u00b2 +1/2 +1/2 = -\u03bb\u00b2 +1\n\nSo setting to zero:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b2 +1=0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of getting 0.\n\nSo the probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0 in the state vector \u03c8.\n\nSo I need to find the eigenvector of P corresponding to \u03bb=0, then compute the inner product with \u03c8, then square it.\n\nLet me find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe have (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v =0.\n\nSo the system is:\n\nRow1: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/sqrt(2) = 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nRow3: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 again, v2=0.\n\nSo from row1 and row3, v2 must be zero.\n\nFrom row2: v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvector is any vector where v2=0 and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo a general solution is v = [a, 0, -a]^T, where a is any scalar.\n\nSo an eigenvector can be written as a * [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nBut eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, so the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1].\n\nWait, but wait, I should check if this is correct.\n\nWait, let me plug in v = [1, 0, -1] into P v.\n\nCompute P v:\n\nRow1: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nRow2: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = (1 -1)/sqrt(2) = 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nRow3: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) =0 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo yes, [1,0,-1] is an eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nBut wait, since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, any scalar multiple of this vector is also an eigenvector.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are all scalar multiples of [1, 0, -1].\n\nNow, I need to compute the inner product between the state vector \u03c8 and this eigenvector.\n\nWait, but the state \u03c8 is given as [-1; 2; 1]. Let's make sure it's normalized. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be \u03c8_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2; 1].\n\nBut wait, the probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \u03c8 and the eigenvector v, divided by the norm of v, I think. Or wait, because eigenvectors can be non-normalized. Let me think.\n\nThe correct formula for the probability is |<v | \u03c8>|^2, where v is a normalized eigenvector.\n\nWait, wait, no. The correct approach is to find the projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenspace of P for the eigenvalue 0.\n\nThe eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector [1; 0; -1]. So to find the projection, we can take the inner product of \u03c8 with this vector, then divide by the squared norm of the vector to normalize.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the probability is given by the squared magnitude of the inner product of \u03c8 with the normalized eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, since the eigenvectors form a basis, any vector in the eigenspace can be used, but normalized.\n\nSo let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the inner product between \u03c8 and the eigenvector v = [1; 0; -1].\n\nThe inner product is \u03c8\u2020 v = (-1)(1) + 2*(0) + (1)*(-1) = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.\n\nBut wait, that's the inner product. However, the eigenvector v is not normalized. So the normalized eigenvector is v_normalized = v / ||v||.\n\nCompute ||v||: sqrt(1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So v_normalized is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nNow, the probability is |<v_normalized | \u03c8>|^2.\n\nCompute the inner product: (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because the inner product is a scalar, but if I compute it as (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + (0)*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 \u2192 that's (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nBut the magnitude squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nWait, but that would imply the probability is 2. But probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake here.\n\nAh, I think I messed up the normalization step. Wait, because \u03c8 itself is not normalized. So perhaps I should normalize \u03c8 before computing the inner product.\n\nLet me redo this.\n\nFirst, compute the inner product between \u03c8 and the eigenvector v = [1; 0; -1].\n\nInner product is (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.\n\nThe norm of v is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2).\n\nThe norm of \u03c8 is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(6).\n\nSo the inner product is (-2), and the product of the norms is sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)=sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3).\n\nSo the normalized inner product is (-2)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )= (-2)/(sqrt(12)) )= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So the probability is 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have normalized both vectors before taking the inner product.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe correct formula is probability = | <v_normalized | \u03c8_normalized> |^2.\n\nSo \u03c8_normalized is \u03c8 divided by its norm, which is sqrt(6). So \u03c8_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1].\n\nv_normalized is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nCompute their inner product:\n\n(1/sqrt(6)) * [ (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + 2*(0) + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\n= (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1/sqrt(2) ) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\n= (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-2/sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\n= ( -2 ) / ( sqrt(6)*sqrt(2) )\n\n= (-2) / (sqrt(12)) )\n\n= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )\n\n= (-1)/sqrt(3)\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. So the correct answer is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a quicker way to compute this.\n\nWait, another approach: The probability is ( |v \u00b7 \u03c8|^2 ) / ( |v|^2 * |\u03c8|^2 ) ?\n\nWait no, because the probability is | <v|\u03c8> / <v|v> |^2.\n\nBecause the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is (v \u00b7 \u03c8) / (v \u00b7 v) ) * v.\n\nSo the squared magnitude is ( (v \u00b7 \u03c8)^2 ) / (v \u00b7 v) ) / (|\u03c8|^2), wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, the probability is the squared norm of the projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenspace. The projection is ( (v \u00b7 \u03c8) / (v \u00b7 v) ) ) * v.\n\nSo the norm squared is ( (v \u00b7 \u03c8)^2 ) / (v \u00b7 v) ) * (v \u00b7 v) ) / (|\u03c8|^2), wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, another way: The projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenspace is [ (v \u00b7 \u03c8) / (v \u00b7 v) ) ] * v.\n\nThe norm of this projection is | (v \u00b7 \u03c8) / (v \u00b7 v) ) | * |v|.\n\nSo the squared norm is ( (v \u00b7 \u03c8)^2 ) / (v \u00b7 v) ) * (v \u00b7 v) ) / ( |v|^2 ), no, I'm getting myself tied up.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the inner product as I did earlier.\n\nBut I think the earlier approach is correct. The probability is 1/3, so the answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The state of the system is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait, no, actually, looking again, it's the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3x1 vector, right? So the system is in a three-dimensional state space.\n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). I need to find the probability that measuring this observable will yield 0 at time t.\n\nWait, okay, so in quantum mechanics, when you have an observable represented by a matrix, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that matrix. So first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the probability of getting a particular outcome is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.\n\nAlternatively, if P is a projection operator, maybe it's a bit different.

So \u03c8 = [-1; 2; 1].\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically normalized. Let me check if \u03c8 is normalized. The norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of its components. So (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state isn't normalized.

Or wait, because eigenvectors can be non-normalized. Let me think.\n\nThe correct formula for the probability is |<v | \u03c8>|^2, where v is a normalized eigenvector.\n\nWait, wait, no. The correct approach is to find the projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenspace of P for the eigenvalue 0.\n\nThe eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector [1; 0; -1]. So to find the projection, we can take the inner product of \u03c8 with this vector, then divide by the squared norm of the vector to normalize.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the probability is given by the squared magnitude of the inner product of \u03c8 with the normalized eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, since the eigenvectors form a basis, any vector in the eigenspace can be used, but normalized.\n\nSo let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the inner product between \u03c8 and the eigenvector v = [1; 0; -1].\n\nThe inner product is \u03c8\u2020 v = (-1)(1) + 2*(0) + (1)*(-1) = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.\n\nBut wait, that's the inner product. However, the eigenvector v is not normalized. So the normalized eigenvector is v_normalized = v / ||v||.\n\nCompute ||v||: sqrt(1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So v_normalized is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nNow, the probability is |<v_normalized | \u03c8>|^2.\n\nCompute the inner product: (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because the inner product is a scalar, but if I compute it as (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + (0)*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 \u2192 that's (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nBut the magnitude squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nWait, but that would imply the probability is 2. But probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake here.\n\nAh, I think I messed up the normalization step. Wait, because \u03c8 itself is not normalized. So perhaps I should normalize \u03c8 before computing the inner product.\n\nLet me redo this.\n\nFirst, compute the inner product between \u03c8 and the eigenvector v = [1; 0; -1].\n\nInner product is (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.\n\nThe norm of v is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2).\n\nThe norm of \u03c8 is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(6).\n\nSo the inner product is (-2), and the product of the norms is sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)=sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3).\n\nSo the normalized inner product is (-2)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )= (-2)/(sqrt(12)) )= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So the probability is 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have normalized both vectors before taking the inner product.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe correct formula is probability = | <v_normalized | \u03c8_normalized> |^2.\n\nSo \u03c8_normalized is \u03c8 divided by its norm, which is sqrt(6). So \u03c8_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1].\n\nv_normalized is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nCompute their inner product:\n\n(1/sqrt(6)) * [ (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + 2*(0) + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\n= (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1/sqrt(2) ) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\n= (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-2/sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\n= ( -2 ) / ( sqrt(6)*sqrt(2) )\n\n= (-2) / (sqrt(12)) )\n\n= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )\n\n= (-1)/sqrt(3)\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. So the correct answer is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a quicker way to compute this.\n\nWait, another approach: The probability is ( |v \u00b7 \u03c8|^2 ) / ( |v|^2 * |\u03c8|^2 ) ?\n\nWait no, because the probability is | <v|\u03c8> / <v|v> |^2.\n\nBecause the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is (v \u00b7 \u03c8) / (v \u00b7 v) ) * v.\n\nSo the squared magnitude is ( (v \u00b7 \u03c8)^2 ) / (v \u00b7 v) ) / (|\u03c8|^2), wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, the probability is the squared norm of the projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenspace. The projection is ( (v \u00b7 \u03c8) / (v \u00b7 v) ) ) * v.\n\nSo the norm squared is ( (v \u00b7 \u03c8)^2 ) / (v \u00b7 v) ) * (v \u00b7 v) ) / (|\u03c8|^2), wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, another way: The projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenspace is [ (v \u00b7 \u03c8) / (v \u00b7 v) ) ] * v.\n\nThe norm of this projection is | (v \u00b7 \u03c8) / (v \u00b7 v) ) | * |v|.\n\nSo the squared norm is ( (v \u00b7 \u03c8)^2 ) / (v \u00b7 v) ) * (v \u00b7 v) ) / ( |v|^2 ), no, I'm getting myself tied up.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the inner product as I did earlier.\n\nBut I think the earlier approach is correct. The probability is 1/3, so the answer is option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) to yield 0 for a given quantum state \\( \\psi \\). The state vector \\( \\psi \\) is given as \\( \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\), and the observable \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \\( P \\)\nTo determine the possible outcomes of the measurement, we find the eigenvalues of \\( P \\) by solving the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\). After performing the calculation, the eigenvalues are found to be \\( \\lambda = 0, 1, -1 \\). The observable \\( P \\) can therefore yield 0, 1, or -1.\n\n### Step 2: Eigenvector for \\( \\lambda = 0 \\)\nFor \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), the eigenvector satisfies \\( P \\mathbf{v} = 0 \\). Solving the system, the eigenvector corresponding to \\( \\lambda = 0 \\) is \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\). Normalizing this eigenvector, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{normalized}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Inner Product and Probability\nThe probability of measuring 0 is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of \\( \\psi \\) onto the eigenspace of \\( P \\) corresponding to \\( \\lambda = 0 \\). First, compute the inner product:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{normalized}} | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( -1 + 0 - 1 \\right) = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability is the squared magnitude of this inner product:\n\n\\[\nP(0) = \\left| \\langle \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{normalized}} | \\psi \\rangle \\right|^2 = \\left( -\\sqrt{2} \\right)^2 = 2.\n\\]\n\nHowever, this result exceeds the maximum probability of 1. To resolve this, the state \\( \\psi \\) must be normalized. The norm of \\( \\psi \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\|\\psi\\| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nThe normalized state is:\n\n\\[\n\\psi_{\\text{normalized}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nRecomputing the inner product with the normalized \\( \\psi \\):\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{normalized}} | \\psi_{\\text{normalized}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{6}} \\left( -1 + 0 - 1 \\right) = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability is now:\n\n\\[\nP(0) = \\left| \\langle \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{normalized}} | \\psi_{\\text{normalized}} \\rangle \\right|^2 = \\left( \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability of measuring 0 is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe question says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait a minute. That doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should be normalized, meaning their length (or norm) should be 1. So I probably need to normalize this vector first. Let me calculate the norm. The components are -1, 2, and 1. So the square of each is 1, 4, and 1. Adding those up gives 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1). Let me write that as a column vector: [ -1/sqrt(6) ; 2/sqrt(6) ; 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nNext, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, let me make sure I'm reading that right. Oh, wait, the second row has elements 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). So the matrix P looks like this:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Observables in quantum mechanics are Hermitian matrices, right? Because their eigenvalues (which correspond to possible measurement outcomes) are real. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. So let's compute the conjugate transpose of P and see.\n\nThe conjugate transpose (dagger) of P would be the transpose of P with complex conjugates. Since all the elements here are real, the transpose is just flipping the rows and columns. Let's see:\n\nOriginal P:\nRow 1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nThe transpose of P would have columns as rows. So the first column becomes the first row: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], which matches row 1 of P. The second column becomes [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2], which is row 2 of P. The third column is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], which is row 3. So the transpose equals P, so P is symmetric, which means it's Hermitian. So that's good; P is a valid observable.\n\nNow, the question is about finding the probability that measuring the observable P yields 0. So I need to find the probability that the outcome is 0 when measuring P in the given state.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the observable matrix, and the probability of each outcome is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\nSo first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Once I have the eigenvalues, if 0 is one of them, I can proceed. If not, the probability would be zero.\n\nSo let's find the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues are solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nMatrix P - \u03bbI is:\n\nRow 1: [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\nRow 3: [ 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix should be zero.\n\nCalculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2   -\u03bb      1/\u221a2   |\n| 0      1/\u221a2    -\u03bb     |\n\nI'll expand this determinant. Let me use the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Maybe cofactor expansion along the first row.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ -\u03bb  1/\u221a2 ]\n           [1/\u221a2  -\u03bb ] )\n- (1/\u221a2) * det( [1/\u221a2  1/\u221a2 ]\n                [ 0     -\u03bb ] )\n+ 0 * something (so the last term is zero).\n\nSo let's compute each minor.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ]\n= -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ]\n= -(1/\u221a2) * [ -\u03bb/(\u221a2) - 0 ]\n= -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2)\n= -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb)/(2)\n\nSo putting it together:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) ) + (\u03bb/2)\n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2)\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor that: \u03bb (-\u03bb\u00b2 +1 ) =0.\n\nWhich gives \u03bb =0, and -\u03bb\u00b2 +1=0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=1, -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the probability of getting 0. So that's one of the eigenvalues, so that's good.\n\nNow, the probability of measuring 0 is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components of the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, when projected onto the state vector.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the procedure is: For each eigenvalue \u03bb, find the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace of \u03bb. The probability is the square of the norm of that projection.\n\nSo since 0 is an eigenvalue, we need to find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0, form the projection operator, then compute the expectation.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to diagonalize P. Because if I can write P in diagonal form with eigenvalues, then the probability of getting each eigenvalue is the square of the inner product of the state with the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nBut maybe another approach is to find the matrix that diagonalizes P. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 and then compute the inner product.\n\nSo let's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is as above:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo the system of equations is:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nThird equation: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 again, v2=0.\n\nSo from these, v2=0, and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. Let me set v3 = t, so v1 = -t. So the eigenvectors are t*(-1, 0, 1), where t is a scalar.\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (-1, 0, 1). But wait, I should check if that's correct. Let me plug this vector into P and see if it gets scaled by 0.\n\nSo let me compute P * [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nFirst component: 0*(-1) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*(-1) + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (-1 +1)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*(-1) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1) =0.\n\nSo yes, the vector (-1,0,1) is an eigenvector for \u03bb=0. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, wait, maybe I missed something. Because when I set up the system of equations, the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, v3) with v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (-1, 0, 1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1) scaled by some factor, but perhaps the standard form is (-1, 0, 1). But either way, the direction is the same.\n\nNow, the state vector is [ -1/sqrt(6); 2/sqrt(6); 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nWe need to find the projection of this state onto the eigenspace of P=0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is just the inner product of the state with the eigenvector (normalized), squared.\n\nSo the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is (-1, 0, 1). Let's normalize it. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) (-1, 0, 1) \u2192 which is [-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nNow, the inner product between the state vector and this eigenvector is:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8 | v\u27e9 = [ (-1/sqrt(6)) , (2/sqrt(6)) , (1/sqrt(6)) ] \u00b7 [ -1/sqrt(2) , 0 , 1/sqrt(2) ]\n\nLet's compute each component:\n\n= (-1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2))\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(12) = sqrt(12)/12 = (2*sqrt(3))/12 = sqrt(3)/6.\n\nWait, alternatively, 1/sqrt(12) = sqrt(12)/12 = (2 * sqrt(3))/12 = sqrt(3)/6.\n\nWait, no, sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 1/sqrt(12) is sqrt(12)/(12) \u2192 2*sqrt(3)/12 \u2192 sqrt(3)/6.\n\nWait, but wait, 1/sqrt(12) can be simplified as sqrt(12)/12, which is sqrt(4*3)/12 \u2192 2*sqrt(3)/12 \u2192 sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSo first term is 1/sqrt(12) \u2192 sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSecond term is 0.\n\nThird term: (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) )= 1/sqrt(12) = sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSo adding them up:\n\nsqrt(3)/6 + 0 + sqrt(3)/6 = (2*sqrt(3))/6 = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nSo the inner product is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 3/9 = 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait, that would be option C) 1/3. But let me double-check everything.\n\nWait, let me recompute the inner product more carefully.\n\nThe state vector is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nThe eigenvector is [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ].\n\nInner product:\n\n(-1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)).\n\nEach term:\n\nFirst term: (1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = 1/(sqrt(12)) = sqrt(12)/12 = (2 * sqrt(3))/12 = sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSecond term: 0.\n\nThird term: (1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = same as first term \u2192 sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSum: sqrt(3)/6 + 0 + sqrt(3)/6 = (2 sqrt(3))/6 = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nSo the inner product is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nThe probability is (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = (3)/(9) = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1/3, so that's the answer.\n",

That doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should be normalized, meaning their length (or norm) should be 1. So I probably need to normalize this vector first. Let me calculate the norm. The components are -1, 2, and 1. So the square of each is 1, 4, and 1. Adding those up gives 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1). Let me write that as a column vector: [ -1/sqrt(6) ; 2/sqrt(6) ; 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nNext, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, let me make sure I'm reading that right. Oh, wait, the second row has elements 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). So the matrix P looks like this:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Observables in quantum mechanics are Hermitian matrices, right? Because their eigenvalues (which correspond to possible measurement outcomes) are real. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. So let's compute the conjugate transpose of P and see.\n\nThe conjugate transpose (dagger) of P would be the transpose of P with complex conjugates. Since all the elements here are real, the transpose is just flipping the rows and columns. Let's see:\n\nOriginal P:\nRow 1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nThe transpose of P would have columns as rows. So the first column becomes the first row: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], which matches row 1 of P. The second column becomes [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2], which is row 2 of P. The third column is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], which is row 3. So the transpose equals P, so P is symmetric, which means it's Hermitian. So that's good; P is a valid observable.\n\nNow, the question is about finding the probability that measuring the observable P yields 0. So I need to find the probability that the outcome is 0 when measuring P in the given state.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the observable matrix, and the probability of each outcome is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\nSo first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Once I have the eigenvalues, if 0 is one of them, I can proceed. If not, the probability would be zero.\n\nSo let's find the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues are solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nMatrix P - \u03bbI is:\n\nRow 1: [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\nRow 3: [ 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix should be zero.\n\nCalculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2   -\u03bb      1/\u221a2   |\n| 0      1/\u221a2    -\u03bb     |\n\nI'll expand this determinant. Let me use the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Maybe cofactor expansion along the first row.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ -\u03bb  1/\u221a2 ]\n           [1/\u221a2  -\u03bb ] )\n- (1/\u221a2) * det( [1/\u221a2  1/\u221a2 ]\n                [ 0     -\u03bb ] )\n+ 0 * something (so the last term is zero).\n\nSo let's compute each minor.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ]\n= -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ]\n= -(1/\u221a2) * [ -\u03bb/(\u221a2) - 0 ]\n= -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2)\n= -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb)/(2)\n\nSo putting it together:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) ) + (\u03bb/2)\n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2)\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor that: \u03bb (-\u03bb\u00b2 +1 ) =0.\n\nWhich gives \u03bb =0, and -\u03bb\u00b2 +1=0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=1, -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the probability of getting 0. So that's one of the eigenvalues, so that's good.\n\nNow, the probability of measuring 0 is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components of the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, when projected onto the state vector.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the procedure is: For each eigenvalue \u03bb, find the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace of \u03bb. The probability is the square of the norm of that projection.\n\nSo since 0 is an eigenvalue, we need to find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0, form the projection operator, then compute the expectation.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to diagonalize P. Because if I can write P in diagonal form with eigenvalues, then the probability of getting each eigenvalue is the square of the inner product of the state with the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nBut maybe another approach is to find the matrix that diagonalizes P. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 and then compute the inner product.\n\nSo let's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is as above:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo the system of equations is:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nThird equation: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 again, v2=0.\n\nSo from these, v2=0, and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. Let me set v3 = t, so v1 = -t. So the eigenvectors are t*(-1, 0, 1), where t is a scalar.\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (-1, 0, 1). But wait, I should check if that's correct. Let me plug this vector into P and see if it gets scaled by 0.\n\nSo let me compute P * [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nFirst component: 0*(-1) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*(-1) + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (-1 +1)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*(-1) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1) =0.\n\nSo yes, the vector (-1,0,1) is an eigenvector for \u03bb=0. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, wait, maybe I missed something. Because when I set up the system of equations, the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, v3) with v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (-1, 0, 1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1) scaled by some factor, but perhaps the standard form is (-1, 0, 1). But either way, the direction is the same.\n\nNow, the state vector is [ -1/sqrt(6); 2/sqrt(6); 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nWe need to find the projection of this state onto the eigenspace of P=0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is just the inner product of the state with the eigenvector (normalized), squared.\n\nSo the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is (-1, 0, 1). Let's normalize it. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) (-1, 0, 1) \u2192 which is [-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nNow, the inner product between the state vector and this eigenvector is:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8 | v\u27e9 = [ (-1/sqrt(6)) , (2/sqrt(6)) , (1/sqrt(6)) ] \u00b7 [ -1/sqrt(2) , 0 , 1/sqrt(2) ]\n\nLet's compute each component:\n\n= (-1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2))\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(12) = sqrt(12)/12 = (2*sqrt(3))/12 = sqrt(3)/6.\n\nWait, alternatively, 1/sqrt(12) = sqrt(12)/12 = (2 * sqrt(3))/12 = sqrt(3)/6.\n\nWait, no, sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 1/sqrt(12) is sqrt(12)/(12) \u2192 2*sqrt(3)/12 \u2192 sqrt(3)/6.\n\nWait, but wait, 1/sqrt(12) can be simplified as sqrt(12)/12, which is sqrt(4*3)/12 \u2192 2*sqrt(3)/12 \u2192 sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSo first term is 1/sqrt(12) \u2192 sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSecond term is 0.\n\nThird term: (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) )= 1/sqrt(12) = sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSo adding them up:\n\nsqrt(3)/6 + 0 + sqrt(3)/6 = (2*sqrt(3))/6 = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nSo the inner product is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 3/9 = 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait, that would be option C) 1/3. But let me double-check everything.\n\nWait, let me recompute the inner product more carefully.\n\nThe state vector is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nThe eigenvector is [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ].\n\nInner product:\n\n(-1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)).\n\nEach term:\n\nFirst term: (1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = 1/(sqrt(12)) = sqrt(12)/12 = (2 * sqrt(3))/12 = sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSecond term: 0.\n\nThird term: (1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = same as first term \u2192 sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSum: sqrt(3)/6 + 0 + sqrt(3)/6 = (2 sqrt(3))/6 = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nSo the inner product is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nThe probability is (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = (3)/(9) = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1/3, so that's the answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state vector. The state vector is initially given as \\((-1, 2, 1)\\). Its norm is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the normalized state vector is:\n\n\\[\n\\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nNext, the observable \\(P\\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix} \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the probability of measuring \\(P = 0\\), we first determine the eigenvalues of \\(P\\). Solving the characteristic equation \\(\\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0\\), we find the eigenvalues to be \\(\\lambda = 0, 1, -1\\). The eigenvalue \\(\\lambda = 0\\) corresponds to the eigenspace we are interested in.\n\nFor \\(\\lambda = 0\\), solving \\((P - 0I)v = 0\\) gives the eigenvector:\n\n\\[\nv = t \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad t \\in \\mathbb{R}.\n\\]\n\nNormalizing this eigenvector, we obtain:\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability of measuring \\(P = 0\\) is the square of the projection of \\(\\psi\\) onto the eigenspace of \\(P = 0\\). The projection is computed as the inner product:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi | v \\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} & \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi | v \\rangle = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right)(0) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right),\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi | v \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}} + 0 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this projection:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\left|\\langle \\psi | v \\rangle\\right|^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of measuring \\(P = 0\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0 at a specific time t. \n\nThe state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, so that's a 3x1 column vector. And the observable P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). \n\nI remember that in quantum mechanics, the observable is represented by a matrix operator, and the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is related to the eigenvectors of that operator. So, I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are determined by the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvectors.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a shortcut here. Alternatively, I recall that the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude, which is the inner product of the state vector and the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue. But first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nLet me try to find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is:\n\n[ 0       1/\u221a2     0 ]\n[1/\u221a2    0      1/\u221a2 ]\n[ 0       1/\u221a2     0 ]\n\nHmm, that's a symmetric matrix, so it should have real eigenvalues. Also, symmetric matrices are diagonalizable, which is good. Maybe I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nSo, the matrix P - \u03bbI is:\n\n[ -\u03bb    1/\u221a2      0   ]\n[1/\u221a2  -\u03bb     1/\u221a2 ]\n[ 0    1/\u221a2    -\u03bb   ]\n\nCalculating the determinant of this matrix.\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's do it step by step.\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ -\u03bb   1/\u221a2 ]\n           [1/\u221a2  -\u03bb  ] )\n\n- 1/\u221a2 * det( [1/\u221a2  1/\u221a2 ]\n               [0      -\u03bb   ] )\n\n+ 0 * something (so that term drops out)\n\nSo, the first term is -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] = -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2)).\n\nThe second term is - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ] = - (1/\u221a2)( - \u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (\u03bb)/2.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The minor for the element at (1,2) is the determinant of the submatrix when row 1 and column 2 are removed. So the submatrix is:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, -\u03bb]\n\nWait, no, wait. The original matrix is:\n\nRow 1: -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb\n\nWait, when I remove row 1 and column 2, the submatrix is:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, -\u03bb]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the minor for (1,2) would be the determinant of the matrix after removing row 1 and column 2. So the remaining rows are 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo the submatrix is:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, that's not correct. The columns remaining are 1 and 3, so for row 2, it's (1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2), and row 3 is (0, -\u03bb). So the determinant of this 2x2 matrix is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) = -\u03bb/\u221a2.\n\nSo the second term is - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nPutting it together, the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0.\n\nLet me factor this:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0. Wait, wait, let me expand:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb * 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0.\n\nWait, because -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2). Then, the second term is + (\u03bb/2).\n\nSo adding them:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2) = 0.\n\nSo the solutions are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 1, -1, and 0.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So the eigenvalue we're interested in is 0.\n\nNow, to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, because the probability is the square of the amplitude of the state vector in that eigenvector.\n\nSo, let's find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0. That means solving (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo, the system of equations is:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(v1 + v3) = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 same as first equation, which gives v2=0.\n\nSo, the eigenvector is proportional to (v1, 0, -v1). Let's choose v1=1, so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1).\n\nWait, but I should check if this is correct. Let me plug it into P.\n\nP multiplied by (1,0,-1):\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2) - (1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0. Wait, that's zero, but the eigenvector should be scaled by \u03bb, which is zero here. So 0 * (1,0,-1) = (0,0,0), which matches P*v. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, wait. The eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is (1, 0, -1). Or any scalar multiple. So, the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1) up to a scalar factor.\n\nBut wait, the state vector given is (-1, 2, 1). We can write this as a column vector, say, |\u03c8\u27e9 = [-1; 2; 1].\n\nThe probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude, which is the inner product of |\u03c8\u27e9 and the eigenvector |v\u27e9 divided by the normalization of |v\u27e9. Wait, but I think I should normalize the eigenvector first.\n\nSo, the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). Its norm is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the unit eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, or wait, since (1,0,-1) is the eigenvector, then the normalized form is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, the amplitude is the inner product of |\u03c8\u27e9 and this normalized eigenvector.\n\nSo, compute \u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9 = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1.\n\nWhich is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but wait, that would be -sqrt(2), because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). So -2/sqrt(2) is -sqrt(2). Hmm, but the inner product is a complex number, but in this case, it's real.\n\nWait, no, wait: 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), because 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) )= sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2/sqrt(2)) ) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, that's a problem because the inner product squared would be (sqrt(2))^2=2, which is greater than 1, but probabilities can't be more than 1.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake here. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1), right? So the normalized version is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n\u03c8 \u00b7 v = (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) ) + 2*(0) + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWhich is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2/sqrt(2)) ) = -sqrt(2).\n\nThe amplitude is -sqrt(2), so the probability is |amplitude|^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nBut that's impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the eigenvector. Let me re-examine the eigenvector calculation.\n\nWhen P v = 0, and we set up the equations:\n\nFrom row 1: (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\nFrom row 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nRow 3: (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 again v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvector is (v1, 0, -v1). Let's choose v1 = 1, so the vector is (1, 0, -1). The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, the inner product between the state vector \u03c8 = [-1, 2, 1] and this eigenvector is:\n\n( (-1) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2 * 0) + (1 * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2/sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2).\n\nThe square of the absolute value is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But this can't be right because probabilities can't be more than 1. That suggests I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector. Maybe I forgot a component or miscalculated the equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the eigenvectors are correctly normalized. Wait, but the eigenvector is correctly normalized to 1. So why is the inner product giving a value with square 2?\n\nWait, the state vector \u03c8 is given as (-1, 2, 1). Is it normalized? Let's check.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. Oh, that's a crucial point!\n\nSo, when calculating probabilities, I should use the normalized state. So, perhaps I should first normalize the state vector.\n\nAlternatively, the probability is the square of the amplitude (inner product) divided by the norm of the state squared. Because the state is not normalized, the probabilities are calculated as |\u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9|^2 / \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nWait, no, the state vector is |\u03c8\u27e9, and the probability is |\u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9|^2 / \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c8\u27e9, where \u27e8v| is the normalized eigenvector.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, but in this problem, the given state is not. So, perhaps I need to normalize it first.\n\nWait, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1). So, the norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1).\n\nSo, the state vector is |\u03c8\u27e9 = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nThe eigenvector |v\u27e9 corresponding to \u03bb=0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.\n\nSo the inner product \u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9 is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) )\n\nWhich is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\nThat's ( -1/(sqrt(12)) ) + ( -1/(sqrt(12)) ) = (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 2/(2 sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the inner product is (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe square of the absolute value is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. So the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but let me recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe steps were:\n\n1. Find eigenvalues of P: 1, -1, 0.\n\n2. For \u03bb=0, find eigenvector (1, 0, -1), normalize to (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\n3. The given state vector is (-1,2,1), which has norm sqrt(6). So normalized state is each component divided by sqrt(6).\n\n4. Compute inner product between normalized state and eigenvector.\n\n5. The inner product is (-1/sqrt(6))(1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWhich is [ -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ] + [ -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ] = -2/(sqrt(12)).\n\nsqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2*sqrt(3). So 2/(2*sqrt(3))=1/sqrt(3). But with a negative sign, but since we take the square, the sign doesn't matter.\n\nSo the inner product is -1/sqrt(3), absolute value squared is 1/3. So the probability is 1/3.\n\nSo the answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0 at a specific time t. \n\nThe state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, so that's a 3x1 column vector. And the observable P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). \n\nI remember that in quantum mechanics, the observable is represented by a matrix operator, and the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is related to the eigenvectors of that operator. So, I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are determined by the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvectors.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a shortcut here. Alternatively, I recall that the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude, which is the inner product of the state vector and the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue. But first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nLet me try to find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is:\n\n[ 0       1/\u221a2     0 ]\n[1/\u221a2    0      1/\u221a2 ]\n[ 0       1/\u221a2     0 ]\n\nHmm, that's a symmetric matrix, so it should have real eigenvalues. Also, symmetric matrices are diagonalizable, which is good. Maybe I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nSo, the matrix P - \u03bbI is:\n\n[ -\u03bb    1/\u221a2      0   ]\n[1/\u221a2  -\u03bb     1/\u221a2 ]\n[ 0    1/\u221a2    -\u03bb   ]\n\nCalculating the determinant of this matrix.\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's do it step by step.\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ -\u03bb   1/\u221a2 ]\n           [1/\u221a2  -\u03bb  ] )\n\n- 1/\u221a2 * det( [1/\u221a2  1/\u221a2 ]\n               [0      -\u03bb   ] )\n\n+ 0 * something (so that term drops out)\n\nSo, the first term is -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] = -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2)).\n\nThe second term is - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ] = - (1/\u221a2)( - \u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (\u03bb)/2.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The minor for the element at (1,2) is the determinant of the submatrix when row 1 and column 2 are removed. So the submatrix is:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, -\u03bb]\n\nWait, no, wait. The original matrix is:\n\nRow 1: -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb\n\nWait, when I remove row 1 and column 2, the submatrix is:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, -\u03bb]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the minor for (1,2) would be the determinant of the matrix after removing row 1 and column 2. So the remaining rows are 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo the submatrix is:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, that's not correct. The columns remaining are 1 and 3, so for row 2, it's (1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2), and row 3 is (0, -\u03bb). So the determinant of this 2x2 matrix is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) = -\u03bb/\u221a2.\n\nSo the second term is - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nPutting it together, the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0.\n\nLet me factor this:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0. Wait, wait, let me expand:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb * 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0.\n\nWait, because -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2). Then, the second term is + (\u03bb/2).\n\nSo adding them:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2) = 0.\n\nSo the solutions are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 1, -1, and 0.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So the eigenvalue we're interested in is 0.\n\nNow, to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, because the probability is the square of the amplitude of the state vector in that eigenvector.\n\nSo, let's find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0. That means solving (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo, the system of equations is:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(v1 + v3) = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 same as first equation, which gives v2=0.\n\nSo, the eigenvector is proportional to (v1, 0, -v1). Let's choose v1=1, so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1).\n\nWait, but I should check if this is correct. Let me plug it into P.\n\nP multiplied by (1,0,-1):\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2) - (1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0. Wait, that's zero, but the eigenvector should be scaled by \u03bb, which is zero here. So 0 * (1,0,-1) = (0,0,0), which matches P*v. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, wait. The eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is (1, 0, -1). Or any scalar multiple. So, the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1) up to a scalar factor.\n\nBut wait, the state vector given is (-1, 2, 1). We can write this as a column vector, say, |\u03c8\u27e9 = [-1; 2; 1].\n\nThe probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude, which is the inner product of |\u03c8\u27e9 and the eigenvector |v\u27e9 divided by the normalization of |v\u27e9. Wait, but I think I should normalize the eigenvector first.\n\nSo, the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). Its norm is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the unit eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, or wait, since (1,0,-1) is the eigenvector, then the normalized form is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, the amplitude is the inner product of |\u03c8\u27e9 and this normalized eigenvector.\n\nSo, compute \u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9 = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1.\n\nWhich is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but wait, that would be -sqrt(2), because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). So -2/sqrt(2) is -sqrt(2). Hmm, but the inner product is a complex number, but in this case, it's real.\n\nWait, no, wait: 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), because 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) )= sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2/sqrt(2)) ) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, that's a problem because the inner product squared would be (sqrt(2))^2=2, which is greater than 1, but probabilities can't be more than 1.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake here. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1), right? So the normalized version is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n\u03c8 \u00b7 v = (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) ) + 2*(0) + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWhich is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2/sqrt(2)) ) = -sqrt(2).\n\nThe amplitude is -sqrt(2), so the probability is |amplitude|^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nBut that's impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the eigenvector. Let me re-examine the eigenvector calculation.\n\nWhen P v = 0, and we set up the equations:\n\nFrom row 1: (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\nFrom row 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nRow 3: (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 again v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvector is (v1, 0, -v1). Let's choose v1 = 1, so the vector is (1, 0, -1). The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, the inner product between the state vector \u03c8 = [-1, 2, 1] and this eigenvector is:\n\n( (-1) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2 * 0) + (1 * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2/sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2).\n\nThe square of the absolute value is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But this can't be right because probabilities can't be more than 1. That suggests I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector. Maybe I forgot a component or miscalculated the equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the eigenvectors are correctly normalized. Wait, but the eigenvector is correctly normalized to 1. So why is the inner product giving a value with square 2?\n\nWait, the state vector \u03c8 is given as (-1, 2, 1). Is it normalized? Let's check.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. Oh, that's a crucial point!\n\nSo, when calculating probabilities, I should use the normalized state. So, perhaps I should first normalize the state vector.\n\nAlternatively, the probability is the square of the amplitude (inner product) divided by the norm of the state squared. Because the state is not normalized, the probabilities are calculated as |\u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9|^2 / \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nWait, no, the state vector is |\u03c8\u27e9, and the probability is |\u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9|^2 / \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c8\u27e9, where \u27e8v| is the normalized eigenvector.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, but in this problem, the given state is not. So, perhaps I need to normalize it first.\n\nWait, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1). So, the norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1).\n\nSo, the state vector is |\u03c8\u27e9 = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nThe eigenvector |v\u27e9 corresponding to \u03bb=0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.\n\nSo the inner product \u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9 is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) )\n\nWhich is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\nThat's ( -1/(sqrt(12)) ) + ( -1/(sqrt(12)) ) = (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 2/(2 sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the inner product is (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe square of the absolute value is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. So the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but let me recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe steps were:\n\n1. Find eigenvalues of P: 1, -1, 0.\n\n2. For \u03bb=0, find eigenvector (1, 0, -1), normalize to (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\n3. The given state vector is (-1,2,1), which has norm sqrt(6). So normalized state is each component divided by sqrt(6).\n\n4. Compute inner product between normalized state and eigenvector.\n\n5. The inner product is (-1/sqrt(6))(1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWhich is [ -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ] + [ -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ] = -2/(sqrt(12)).\n\nsqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2*sqrt(3). So 2/(2*sqrt(3))=1/sqrt(3). But with a negative sign, but since we take the square, the sign doesn't matter.\n\nSo the inner product is -1/sqrt(3), absolute value squared is 1/3.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about calculating the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific outcome. Alright, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by operators, and the probabilities come from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these operators.\n\nSo the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a three-dimensional vector, so the system is in a three-level state. Let me write that down. The state vector \u03c8 is:\n\n\u03c8 = [ -1 ]\n     [  2 ]\n     [  1 ]\n\nBut wait, in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually column vectors, and they should be normalized. Oh, right, normalization! The sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should equal 1. Let me check that.\n\nSo |\u22121|\u00b2 + |2|\u00b2 + |1|\u00b2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, that's 6, which is greater than 1. So the vector isn't normalized. I think I need to normalize it first. But wait, the problem might just use it as is for the observable measurement. Hmm, but when calculating probabilities, normalization is crucial. So perhaps I should normalize \u03c8 first.\n\nTo normalize, I'll divide each component by the square root of 6. So the normalized state \u03c8_norm is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nWait, but the problem statement might not require normalization because the observable P could have a trace or something else that affects the probabilities. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed without normalizing for now and see.\n\nThe observable is given by the matrix P. Let me write down the matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P looks like:\n\n[ 0        1/\u221a2      0     ]\n[1/\u221a2      0      1/\u221a2    ]\n[ 0        1/\u221a2     0     ]\n\nWait, that's an interesting matrix. Let me see if I can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities come from the square of the amplitude of the eigenvectors in the state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P is a projection operator. Wait, but for a measurement in an observable, it's more about the eigenvalues and the corresponding projectors. But maybe P itself is diagonal in its eigenbasis, so the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value, but no, the question is about the probability of getting a specific outcome. Hmm.\n\nWait, the question is to find the probability that the measurement yields 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then find the projection of the state \u03c8 onto that eigenvector. The square of the absolute value of that projection gives the probability.\n\nSo first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let me try to compute the eigenvalues of matrix P.\n\nThe matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. Let's denote it as:\n\nRow 1: 0, a, 0 (where a = 1/sqrt(2))\nRow 2: a, 0, a\nRow 3: 0, a, 0\n\nSo, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nThe matrix (P - \u03bb I) is:\n\n[ -\u03bb      a       0 ]\n[ a     -\u03bb      a ]\n[ 0      a     -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - a*a ] - a * [ a*(-\u03bb) - a*0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]\n\nWait, let's compute it step by step. The determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - a^2 ] - a * [ a*(-\u03bb) - a*0 ] + 0 * [ something ]\n\nSo that's:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - a\u00b2) - a ( -a \u03bb )\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb a\u00b2 + a\u00b2 \u03bb\n\nSo:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + 2 \u03bb a\u00b2 = 0\n\nFactor out \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 2 a\u00b2 ) = 0\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb=0, and solving -\u03bb\u00b2 + 2a\u00b2=0 gives \u03bb\u00b2=2 a\u00b2 \u2192 \u03bb= \u00b1 a sqrt(2).\n\nBut wait, a is 1/sqrt(2), so a\u00b2=1/2. So \u03bb\u00b2=2*(1/2)=1 \u2192 \u03bb=\u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the observable P has eigenvalues 0, 1, and -1. So the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nThe question is about the probability of getting 0. So we need to find the eigenvector(s) corresponding to \u03bb=0 and compute the projection of the state \u03c8 onto that eigenvector.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Because the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb=0 will form a subspace. So the probability is the sum of the squares of the projections onto each eigenvector in that subspace. But since it's an observable, it's diagonal in its eigenbasis, so each eigenvector is orthogonal.\n\nWait, perhaps for \u03bb=0, the eigenspace is the set of vectors x such that P x = 0.\n\nAlternatively, since we found the eigenvalues, let's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nSo, for \u03bb=0, the matrix (P - 0 I) = P. So the equation is P x = 0.\n\nSo, writing the equations:\n\nRow 1: 0*x1 + (1/\u221a2) x2 + 0*x3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) x2 = 0 \u2192 x2=0.\n\nRow 2: (1/\u221a2) x1 + 0 x2 + (1/\u221a2) x3 = 0 \u2192 x1 + x3 = 0 \u2192 x3 = -x1.\n\nRow 3: 0 x1 + (1/\u221a2) x2 + 0 x3 =0 \u2192 x2=0.\n\nSo from row 1 and 3, x2 must be zero.\n\nFrom row 2, x3 = -x1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form [x1, 0, -x1]^T. So x1 can be any real number. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector [1, 0, -1]^T (or any scalar multiple of it).\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is proportional to [1, 0, -1]^T. Let me call this vector v0.\n\nSo, to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to compute the squared modulus of the inner product between the state \u03c8 and v0.\n\nBut wait, wait. The state \u03c8 is given as (-1, 2, 1). But I should check if it's normalized. Earlier, I saw that the sum is 6, so it's not normalized. So I have two options: either normalize \u03c8 first, or perhaps the observable's matrix is such that it's already accounted for. Hmm.\n\nWait, in quantum mechanics, the state must be normalized because the probabilities must add up to 1. So I think I should normalize \u03c8 before proceeding.\n\nSo, the state \u03c8 is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, and its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6).\n\nSo the normalized state is \u03c8_norm = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nNow, the eigenvector v0 is [1, 0, -1]^T. Let's normalize v0. Its norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is u0 = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nNow, the probability P(0) is | <u0 | \u03c8_norm > |^2.\n\nCompute the inner product:\n\n< u0 | \u03c8_norm > = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] * (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nMultiplying the vectors:\n\n1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*1 = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.\n\nThen, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) * (-2) ) = (1/(sqrt(12))) )*(-2) = (-2)/ (2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nWait, because sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3). So 1/sqrt(12) is 1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSo (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) times the dot product of [1,0,-1] and [-1,2,1].\n\nDot product: (1)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)(1) = -1 +0 -1 = -2.\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(6)) ) * (-2) = (1/sqrt(12)) ) * (-2) = (-2)/ (2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe modulus squared is (1/sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA) 2/3\n\nB) 1\n\nC) 1/3\n\nD) sqrt(2/3)\n\nSo the correct answer is option C, 1/3.\n",

So the normalized eigenvector is u0 = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nNow, the probability P(0) is | <u0 | \u03c8_norm > |^2.\n\nCompute the inner product:\n\n< u0 | \u03c8_norm > = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] * (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nMultiplying the vectors:\n\n1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*1 = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.\n\nThen, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) * (-2) ) = (1/(sqrt(12))) )*(-2) = (-2)/ (2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nWait, because sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3). So 1/sqrt(12) is 1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSo (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) times the dot product of [1,0,-1] and [-1,2,1].\n\nDot product: (1)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)(1) = -1 +0 -1 = -2.\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(6)) ) * (-2) = (1/sqrt(12)) ) * (-2) = (-2)/ (2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe modulus squared is (1/sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA) 2/3\n\nB) 1\n\nC) 1/3\n\nD) sqrt(2/3)\n\nSo the correct answer is option C, 1/3.\n\n\nTo calculate the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) and obtaining the outcome \\( 0 \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the state vector\nThe state of the system is given as \\( \\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain value for an observable. \n\nAlright, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, so that's a vector in three dimensions, right? But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors in a complex vector space, but the components here are real numbers. Oh, but I guess that's okay; the problem doesn't specify they have to be complex. \n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write that down. P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, I should note that.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the measurement of P will yield 0. So in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator. So I think I need to find the eigenvalues of matrix P and see which ones are zero, then find the probability of getting that eigenvalue.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of projectors. Because sometimes the observable can be expressed as a sum of projectors onto its eigenstates multiplied by their eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P itself is a projector? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, another thought: if P is an observable, it must be a Hermitian matrix because observables are Hermitian. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, each element P_ij must equal the complex conjugate of P_ji. \n\nLooking at P's elements:\n\nFirst row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\nSecond row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nThird row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nLet's check if P is symmetric, because all elements are real here. Because if all elements are real, then Hermitian is equivalent to symmetric. So looking at P_ij and P_ji:\n\nP_12 is 1/sqrt(2), and P_21 is 1/sqrt(2) as well. Similarly, P_13 is 0, and P_31 is 0. P_23 is 1/sqrt(2), and P_32 is 1/sqrt(2). So yes, the matrix is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So it's a valid observable.\n\nNow, to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues are the possible outcomes, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state vector in the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the matrix P. Looking at it, I notice it's a symmetric matrix with 0s on the diagonal except for the middle element, which is 0 as well. Wait, no, the diagonal elements are 0 for all three positions. So P is a 3x3 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and specific values off-diagonal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a projection operator. Let me see. If P is a projection matrix, then P^2 should equal P. Let me compute P squared to check.\n\nCalculating P squared:\n\nLet me write P as:\n\nRow 1: 0   a   0\nRow 2: a   0   a\nRow 3: 0   a   0\nwhere a = 1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo P squared would be P multiplied by P.\n\nLet me compute each element.\n\nFirst element (1,1):\n\nRow 1 of P multiplied by column 1 of P.\n\n(0)(0) + a*a + 0*0 = a\u00b2.\n\nWait, but a is 1/sqrt(2), so a\u00b2 is 1/2.\n\nHmm, but if P was a projection matrix, P^2 should equal P. Let me see. So element (1,1) in P squared is 1/2, but in P it's 0. So P squared is not equal to P. Therefore, P is not a projection matrix. Hmm, so that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P can be expressed as a sum of projectors. Alternatively, maybe I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n\nBut finding the eigenvalues of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit involved. Let me try to find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nThe matrix P is:\n\n0   a   0\na   0   a\n0   a   0\n\nSo the characteristic equation is determinant of (P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n| -\u03bb    a      0     |\n| a   -\u03bb     a     |\n| 0     a    -\u03bb    |\n\nLet me compute this determinant.\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ -\u03bb  a; a  -\u03bb ] ) - a * det( [ a  a; 0 -\u03bb ] ) + 0 * ... \n\nSo first term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - a*a ] = -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - a\u00b2)\n\nSecond term: -a * [ a*(-\u03bb) - a*0 ] = -a * (-a \u03bb) = a\u00b2 \u03bb\n\nThird term is 0.\n\nSo overall determinant:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - a\u00b2) + a\u00b2 \u03bb = 0\n\nFactor out \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb [ - (\u03bb\u00b2 - a\u00b2) + a\u00b2 ] = 0\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = -\u03bb\u00b2 + 2 a\u00b2\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n\u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 2 a\u00b2 ) = 0\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, and solutions to -\u03bb\u00b2 + 2 a\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2 = 2 a\u00b2 \u2192 \u03bb = sqrt(2) a and \u03bb = - sqrt(2) a.\n\nBut since a is 1/sqrt(2), sqrt(2) a = sqrt(2) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) = 1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Because a is 1/sqrt(2), so 2 a\u00b2 is 2 * (1/2) )= 1. So the equation for the other roots is \u03bb\u00b2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 and \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1. The question asks for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the inner product between the state vector and that eigenvector. The probability is the square of the absolute value of that inner product.\n\nSo first, let me find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nThe matrix P - 0 * I is just P. So we have the system:\n\n0 x + a y + 0 z = 0 \u2192 a y = 0 \u2192 y=0.\n\na x + 0 y + a z = 0 \u2192 a x + a z =0 \u2192 x + z = 0 \u2192 z = -x.\n\n0 x + a y + 0 z =0 \u2192 same as first equation, so y=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are all vectors (x, 0, z) where z = -x. So we can write them as x*(1, 0, -1) plus any multiple. So the eigenvector can be normalized.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The equations for \u03bb=0 are:\n\nEquation 1: a y =0 \u2192 y=0.\n\nEquation 2: a x + a z =0 \u2192 x + z =0 \u2192 z = -x.\n\nEquation 3: a y =0 \u2192 y=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form (x, 0, -x). So a basis vector is (1, 0, -1). We can normalize this vector.\n\nThe length is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the eigenvector |v0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, the state vector of the system is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me represent this as a column vector:\n\n|\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. Let me check if this state is normalized. The inner product is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so the state is not normalized. Hmm, but I think the observable's probabilities are calculated based on the given state, regardless of normalization. Or perhaps the probabilities are found using the unnormalized state, but I need to be careful.\n\nWait, wait, no. The probabilities are based on the projection of the state onto the eigenvectors. So I think we proceed regardless of the state's normalization, but when calculating probabilities, perhaps we need to normalize the state first.\n\nWait, the state is given as a vector, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I can proceed by normalizing it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state is not normalized, and the probabilities are calculated without normalizing, but I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe it's better to proceed and see.\n\nSo, the probability of getting 0 is | <v0 | \u03c8> |^2.\n\nSo <v0 | \u03c8> is the inner product between the eigenvector and the state.\n\nv0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\n\u03c8 is (-1, 2, 1).\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.\n\nSo that's (-1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the inner product of two real vectors is just the sum of the products.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute it again:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but that's a real number, and its magnitude squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. So the probability would be 2.\n\nBut that's impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So that suggests that I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should normalize the state vector. Because the state vector in quantum mechanics must have a norm of 1. So perhaps the given state is not normalized, and I need to normalize it first.\n\nThe given state is (-1, 2, 1). Its norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1).\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nSo when I compute the inner product with v0, which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)), the inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).\n\nWhich is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\nSo that's (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) = 2 sqrt(3), so denominator is 2 sqrt(3), numerator is -2.\n\nSo the inner product is (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.\n\nWait, that makes sense because 1/3 is one of the options. Looking back at the options, option C is 1/3.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n",

Let me try to find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nThe matrix P is:\n\n0   a   0\na   0   a\n0   a   0\n\nSo the characteristic equation is determinant of (P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n| -\u03bb    a      0     |\n| a   -\u03bb     a     |\n| 0     a    -\u03bb    |\n\nLet me compute this determinant.\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ -\u03bb  a; a  -\u03bb ] ) - a * det( [ a  a; 0 -\u03bb ] ) + 0 * ... \n\nSo first term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - a*a ] = -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - a\u00b2)\n\nSecond term: -a * [ a*(-\u03bb) - a*0 ] = -a * (-a \u03bb) = a\u00b2 \u03bb\n\nThird term is 0.\n\nSo overall determinant:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - a\u00b2) + a\u00b2 \u03bb = 0\n\nFactor out \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb [ - (\u03bb\u00b2 - a\u00b2) + a\u00b2 ] = 0\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = -\u03bb\u00b2 + 2 a\u00b2\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n\u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 2 a\u00b2 ) = 0\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, and solutions to -\u03bb\u00b2 + 2 a\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2 = 2 a\u00b2 \u2192 \u03bb = sqrt(2) a and \u03bb = - sqrt(2) a.\n\nBut since a is 1/sqrt(2), sqrt(2) a = sqrt(2) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) = 1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Because a is 1/sqrt(2), so 2 a\u00b2 is 2 * (1/2) )= 1. So the equation for the other roots is \u03bb\u00b2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 and \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1. The question asks for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the inner product between the state vector and that eigenvector. The probability is the square of the absolute value of that inner product.\n\nSo first, let me find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nThe matrix P - 0 * I is just P. So we have the system:\n\n0 x + a y + 0 z = 0 \u2192 a y = 0 \u2192 y=0.\n\na x + 0 y + a z = 0 \u2192 a x + a z =0 \u2192 x + z = 0 \u2192 z = -x.\n\n0 x + a y + 0 z =0 \u2192 same as first equation, so y=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are all vectors (x, 0, z) where z = -x. So we can write them as x*(1, 0, -1) plus any multiple. So the eigenvector can be normalized.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The equations for \u03bb=0 are:\n\nEquation 1: a y =0 \u2192 y=0.\n\nEquation 2: a x + a z =0 \u2192 x + z =0 \u2192 z = -x.\n\nEquation 3: a y =0 \u2192 y=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form (x, 0, -x). So a basis vector is (1, 0, -1). We can normalize this vector.\n\nThe length is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the eigenvector |v0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, the state vector of the system is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me represent this as a column vector:\n\n|\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. Let me check if this state is normalized. The inner product is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so the state is not normalized. Hmm, but I think the observable's probabilities are calculated based on the given state, regardless of normalization. Or perhaps the probabilities are found using the unnormalized state, but I need to be careful.\n\nWait, wait, no. The probabilities are based on the projection of the state onto the eigenvectors. So I think we proceed regardless of the state's normalization, but when calculating probabilities, perhaps we need to normalize the state first.\n\nWait, the state is given as a vector, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I can proceed by normalizing it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state is not normalized, and the probabilities are calculated without normalizing, but I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe it's better to proceed and see.\n\nSo, the probability of getting 0 is | <v0 | \u03c8> |^2.\n\nSo <v0 | \u03c8> is the inner product between the eigenvector and the state.\n\nv0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\n\u03c8 is (-1, 2, 1).\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.\n\nSo that's (-1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the inner product of two real vectors is just the sum of the products.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute it again:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but that's a real number, and its magnitude squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. So the probability would be 2.\n\nBut that's impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So that suggests that I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should normalize the state vector. Because the state vector in quantum mechanics must have a norm of 1. So perhaps the given state is not normalized, and I need to normalize it first.\n\nThe given state is (-1, 2, 1). Its norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1).\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nSo when I compute the inner product with v0, which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)), the inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).\n\nWhich is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\nSo that's (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) = 2 sqrt(3), so denominator is 2 sqrt(3), numerator is -2.\n\nSo the inner product is (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.\n\nWait, that makes sense because 1/3 is one of the options. Looking back at the options, option C is 1/3.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the probability of measuring 0 for the observable represented by the matrix \\( P \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the observable \\( P \\)\nThe matrix \\( P \\) is given as:\n\\[\nP = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nSince \\( P \\) is symmetric, it is Hermitian, making it a valid observable in quantum mechanics. The possible outcomes of a measurement of \\( P \\) are its eigenvalues.\n\n### Step 2: Find the eigenvalues of \\( P \\)\nThe eigenvalues of \\( P \\) are determined by solving the characteristic equation:\n\\[\n\\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0.\n\\]\nExpanding the determinant:\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n-\\lambda & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\lambda & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\lambda\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0.\n\\]\nAfter simplifying, the eigenvalues are found to be:\n\\[\n\\lambda = 0, \\, 1, \\, -1.\n\\]\nThus, the possible outcomes of measuring \\( P \\) are 0, 1, and -1.\n\n### Step 3: Find the eigenvector corresponding to \\( \\lambda = 0 \\)\nFor \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), the system \\( (P - 0I)v = 0 \\) gives the eigenvector:\n\\[\nv_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Normalize the state vector\nThe state vector is given as:\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nThe norm of \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) is:\n\\[\n\\|\\psi\\| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\nThe normalized state vector is:\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Compute the probability of measuring 0\nThe probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) onto \\( v_0 \\):\n\\[\nP(0) = |\\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle|^2.\n\\]\nThe inner product is:\n\\[\n\\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{6}} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}} + \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}.\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n\\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{12}} + \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\nThe absolute value squared is:\n\\[\n|\\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = \\left(\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe probability of measuring 0 is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. Alright, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting zero. \n\nSo, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). I think that's a vector in three-dimensional space. Oh wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized. Let me check if this vector is normalized.\n\nThe vector is [-1, 2, 1]. To normalize it, I need to calculate its magnitude. So the square of each component: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Summing those gives 1+4+1=6. So the magnitude is sqrt(6). Therefore, the actual state vector should be each component divided by sqrt(6). But wait, the question just gives the state as (-1, 2, 1) without normalization. Hmm, maybe I should proceed with this vector as is, but perhaps during the calculation, normalization will take care of it.\n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write it down:\n\nP is a 3x3 matrix where the first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So, P looks like this:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nWait, that's interesting. So P is a symmetric matrix. In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, which are symmetric if they're real. So this checks out.\n\nThe task is to find the probability that measuring P will yield 0. Okay, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable's matrix. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which ones are zero, but wait, actually, the eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So if 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to approach it differently. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue (here, 0) is equal to the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state vector and the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue. But to find that, I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the expectation value, but that's not directly helpful for the probability unless I know the eigenvalues. Hmm, perhaps another approach: since P is the observable, the probability of getting 0 is the sum over all basis states where P has 0 in the diagonal. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P can be diagonalized, and the probability is the sum of the squares of the components in the eigenbasis.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute P acting on the state vector, but that's not directly helpful either. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of P, but that's not the same as the probability of getting 0. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have a state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 and an observable P with eigenvectors |p\u27e9 and eigenvalues \u03bb, the probability of measuring \u03bb is |\u27e8p|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2. So the process is:\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n2. For each eigenvalue \u03bb, compute the inner product of the eigenvector with the state vector.\n3. The probability is the square of the absolute value of that inner product.\n\nSo first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nLet me write the matrix P again:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nSo, the matrix (P - \u03bbI) is:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2]\n[ 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nCalculating the determinant of this matrix.\n\nThe determinant can be a bit tricky. Let me write it out:\n\n| -\u03bb       1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2     -\u03bb      1/\u221a2   |\n| 0       1/\u221a2     -\u03bb     |\n\nExpanding the determinant, maybe along the first row.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ]\n+ 0 * [ ... ] (since the third term is zero, so we can ignore it)\n\nSo, let's compute each part.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb * [ (\u03bb^2) - (1/2) ] = -\u03bb (\u03bb^2 - 1/2 )\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) - 0 ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb)/(2)\n\nWait, wait. Let me be precise.\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n(-\u03bb) * det(minor of -\u03bb) \n- (1/\u221a2) * det(minor of 1/\u221a2)\n+ 0 * det(minor of 0)\n\nThe minor for the first element (-\u03bb) is the submatrix:\n[ -\u03bb      1/\u221a2 ]\n[1/\u221a2    -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant of that is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nSo the first term is (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nThe minor for the second element (1/\u221a2) is the submatrix:\n[1/\u221a2     1/\u221a2 ]\n[0        -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, no, wait. The minor for the element in row 1, column 2 is the submatrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2. So the minor is:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo the submatrix is:\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n[0,     -\u03bb ]\n\nSo the determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) )= (-\u03bb /\u221a2 )\n\nSo the second term is - (1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb /\u221a2) ] \n\nWait, because the sign for the second term is (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1. So the second term in the expansion is:\n\n- (1/\u221a2) * ( (-\u03bb) / \u221a2 ) * (-1)^(1+2) ?\n\nWait, the cofactor expansion formula is:\n\nsum_{j=1 to n} [ (-1)^{i+j} * M_ij * det(minor) ]\n\nSo for row 1, j=1,2,3.\n\nSo for j=1: (-1)^{1+1} * M_11 * det(minor) \u2192 + (-\u03bb) * det(minor)\nj=2: (-1)^{1+2} * M_12 * det(minor) \u2192 - (1/\u221a2) * det(minor)\nj=3: (-1)^{1+3} * M_13 * det(minor) \u2192 + 0 * det(...)\n\nSo the expansion is:\n\n(-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] \n+ 0\n\nWait, no. The minor for j=2 is the submatrix when row 1 and column 2 are removed. So the submatrix is rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3. So the elements are:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0,     -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, no, the columns after removing column 2 are columns 1 and 3. So for the minor when j=2, the submatrix is:\n\nRow 2: elements from columns 1 and 3: 1/\u221a2 and 1/\u221a2.\nRow 3: elements from columns 1 and 3: 0 and -\u03bb.\n\nSo the minor matrix is:\n[1/\u221a2   1/\u221a2 ]\n[ 0      -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) )= -\u03bb /\u221a2.\n\nSo the term is (-1)^{1+2} * M_12 * det(minor) = (-1)^3 * (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (-1) * (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (\u03bb)/(2).\n\nSo putting it all together, the determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = ?\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nFirst term: (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2)\n\nSecond term: + (\u03bb/2)\n\nSo overall, determinant is (-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb/2) + \u03bb/2 = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(1 - \u03bb\u00b2) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo the probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude associated with the eigenvalue 0.\n\nNow, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nSo, let's solve (P - 0 I) |v\u27e9 = 0 \u2192 P |v\u27e9 = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n1. 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0\n2. (1/\u221a2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)*v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0\n3. 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0\n\nFrom equation 1 and 3, v2 must be 0.\n\nEquation 2: v1 + v3 = 0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. So we can write this as v1 * [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nSo the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0 is any scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1).\n\nBut in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are normalized. So the normalized eigenvector is (1, 0, -1) divided by its norm.\n\nThe norm squared is 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nWait, but for the purpose of calculating the inner product, maybe we don't need to normalize the eigenvector because the state vector might not be normalized either. Hmm, but wait, the state vector given is [-1, 2, 1]. Let me check if it's normalized.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it before proceeding.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized, right? Because probabilities must sum to 1. So perhaps the given state is [-1, 2, 1], but it's actually a normalized vector. Wait, no. Because sqrt(6) is approximately 2.45, so the vector isn't normalized.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. Alright, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting zero. \n\nSo, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). I think that's a vector in three-dimensional space. Oh wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized. Let me check if this vector is normalized.\n\nThe vector is [-1, 2, 1]. To normalize it, I need to calculate its magnitude. So the square of each component: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Summing those gives 1+4+1=6. So the magnitude is sqrt(6). Therefore, the actual state vector should be each component divided by sqrt(6). But wait, the question just gives the state as (-1, 2, 1) without normalization. Hmm, maybe I should proceed with this vector as is, but perhaps during the calculation, normalization will take care of it.\n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write it down:\n\nP is a 3x3 matrix where the first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So, P looks like this:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nWait, that's interesting. So P is a symmetric matrix. In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, which are symmetric if they're real. So this checks out.\n\nThe task is to find the probability that measuring P will yield 0. Okay, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable's matrix. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which ones are zero, but wait, actually, the eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So if 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to approach it differently. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue (here, 0) is equal to the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state vector and the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue. But to find that, I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the expectation value, but that's not directly helpful for the probability unless I know the eigenvalues. Hmm, perhaps another approach: since P is the observable, the probability of getting 0 is the sum over all basis states where P has 0 in the diagonal. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P can be diagonalized, and the probability is the sum of the squares of the components in the eigenbasis.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute P acting on the state vector, but that's not directly helpful either. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of P, but that's not the same as the probability of getting 0. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have a state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 and an observable P with eigenvectors |p\u27e9 and eigenvalues \u03bb, the probability of measuring \u03bb is |\u27e8p|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2. So the process is:\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n2. For each eigenvalue \u03bb, compute the inner product of the eigenvector with the state vector.\n3. The probability is the square of the absolute value of that inner product.\n\nSo first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nLet me write the matrix P again:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nSo, the matrix (P - \u03bbI) is:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2]\n[ 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nCalculating the determinant of this matrix.\n\nThe determinant can be a bit tricky. Let me write it out:\n\n| -\u03bb       1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2     -\u03bb      1/\u221a2   |\n| 0       1/\u221a2     -\u03bb     |\n\nExpanding the determinant, maybe along the first row.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ]\n+ 0 * [ ... ] (since the third term is zero, so we can ignore it)\n\nSo, let's compute each part.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb * [ (\u03bb^2) - (1/2) ] = -\u03bb (\u03bb^2 - 1/2 )\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) - 0 ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb)/(2)\n\nWait, wait. Let me be precise.\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n(-\u03bb) * det(minor of -\u03bb) \n- (1/\u221a2) * det(minor of 1/\u221a2)\n+ 0 * det(minor of 0)\n\nThe minor for the first element (-\u03bb) is the submatrix:\n[ -\u03bb      1/\u221a2 ]\n[1/\u221a2    -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant of that is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nSo the first term is (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nThe minor for the second element (1/\u221a2) is the submatrix:\n[1/\u221a2     1/\u221a2 ]\n[0        -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, no, wait. The minor for the element in row 1, column 2 is the submatrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2. So the minor is:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo the submatrix is:\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n[0,     -\u03bb ]\n\nSo the determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) )= (-\u03bb /\u221a2 )\n\nSo the second term is - (1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb /\u221a2) ] \n\nWait, because the sign for the second term is (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1. So the second term in the expansion is:\n\n- (1/\u221a2) * ( (-\u03bb) / \u221a2 ) * (-1)^(1+2) ?\n\nWait, the cofactor expansion formula is:\n\nsum_{j=1 to n} [ (-1)^{i+j} * M_ij * det(minor) ]\n\nSo for row 1, j=1,2,3.\n\nSo for j=1: (-1)^{1+1} * M_11 * det(minor) \u2192 + (-\u03bb) * det(minor)\nj=2: (-1)^{1+2} * M_12 * det(minor) \u2192 - (1/\u221a2) * det(minor)\nj=3: (-1)^{1+3} * M_13 * det(minor) \u2192 + 0 * det(...)\n\nSo the expansion is:\n\n(-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] \n+ 0\n\nWait, no. The minor for j=2 is the submatrix when row 1 and column 2 are removed. So the submatrix is rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3. So the elements are:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0,     -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, no, the columns after removing column 2 are columns 1 and 3. So for the minor when j=2, the submatrix is:\n\nRow 2: elements from columns 1 and 3: 1/\u221a2 and 1/\u221a2.\nRow 3: elements from columns 1 and 3: 0 and -\u03bb.\n\nSo the minor matrix is:\n[1/\u221a2   1/\u221a2 ]\n[ 0      -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) )= -\u03bb /\u221a2.\n\nSo the term is (-1)^{1+2} * M_12 * det(minor) = (-1)^3 * (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (-1) * (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (\u03bb)/(2).\n\nSo putting it all together, the determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = ?\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nFirst term: (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2)\n\nSecond term: + (\u03bb/2)\n\nSo overall, determinant is (-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb/2) + \u03bb/2 = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(1 - \u03bb\u00b2) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo the probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude associated with the eigenvalue 0.\n\nNow, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nSo, let's solve (P - 0 I) |v\u27e9 = 0 \u2192 P |v\u27e9 = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n1. 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0\n2. (1/\u221a2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)*v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0\n3. 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0\n\nFrom equation 1 and 3, v2 must be 0.\n\nEquation 2: v1 + v3 = 0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. So we can write this as v1 * [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nSo the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0 is any scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1).\n\nBut in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are normalized. So the normalized eigenvector is (1, 0, -1) divided by its norm.\n\nThe norm squared is 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nWait, but for the purpose of calculating the inner product, maybe we don't need to normalize the eigenvector because the state vector might not be normalized either. Hmm, but wait, the state vector given is [-1, 2, 1]. Let me check if it's normalized.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it before proceeding.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized, right? Because probabilities must sum to 1. So perhaps the given state is [-1, 2, 1], but it's actually a normalized vector. Wait, no. Because sqrt(6) is approximately 2.45, so the vector isn't normalized. So I think I need to normalize it first before proceeding.\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8\u27e9 = 1/sqrt(6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nSo, the normalized state is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nNow, the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0 is |0\u27e9 = [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2). Because its norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2).\n\nSo to find the amplitude \u27e80|\u03c8\u27e9, I compute the inner product of |0\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\n\u27e80|\u03c8\u27e9 = [1/sqrt(2), 0, (-1)/sqrt(2)] \u00b7 [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]\n\nThe inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + ( (-1)/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(6) )\n\nLet's compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (1)(-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) = -1/(sqrt(12)) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSecond term: 0.\n\nThird term: (-1)(1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) = -1/(sqrt(12)) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSo adding these together:\n\n(-1/(2\u221a3)) + 0 + (-1/(2\u221a3)) = -2/(2\u221a3) )= -1/\u221a3.\n\nSo the amplitude is -1/\u221a3.\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1/3.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) and obtaining the eigenvalue \\( 0 \\). The system's state is given as the vector \\( | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\), and the observable \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the state vector\nThe state vector \\( | \\psi \\rangle \\) is not normalized.

The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0 at a given time t.\n\nAlright, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, maybe I should normalize it first? Because in quantum mechanics, states are represented by vectors in a Hilbert space, which must be normalized, meaning their length is 1. So, I need to check if this vector is normalized.\n\nLet me calculate the norm squared. The vector is [-1, 2, 1]. The square of each component is 1, 4, and 1. Adding those gives 1+4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state vector should be normalized by dividing each component by sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]. Let me note that down.\n\nNext, the observable P is given as a matrix. Let me write that out. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So P is a 3x3 matrix.\n\nWait, in quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian operators because they correspond to real measurable quantities. I should check if this matrix is Hermitian. To be Hermitian, the matrix must equal its conjugate transpose. Looking at P, the elements seem to be real numbers, so their conjugates are the same. Let me see the transpose: the (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), which in the transpose becomes (2,1). So yes, all the elements match their transposed positions. So P is Hermitian, which is correct for an observable.\n\nThe next step is to find the probability of measuring 0 when P is measured. To do this, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of measuring an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which one is 0. Then, the probability would be the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the expectation value of P, but wait, no, the question is about the probability of getting exactly 0. So, I should find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P, identify the eigenvalue 0, and then compute the probability.\n\nWait, maybe there's a smarter way. Because the observable P is a matrix, and the state is given, the expectation value is the expectation of P in that state. But that's not directly the probability of getting 0. Hmm.\n\nWait, no. The expectation value is the average outcome of many measurements. But to find the probability of a specific outcome, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue and compute the inner product.\n\nSo let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, find the eigenvalues of P. Let me write out matrix P:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nLet me compute the determinant of (P - \u03bb I).\n\nThe matrix (P - \u03bb I) is:\n\n[\n[-\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n[1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb]\n]\n\nComputing the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's proceed.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] \n- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ] \n+ 0 * [ ... ] (since the third element in the first row is zero, that term goes away)\n\nWait, no, that's not the correct way. The determinant is calculated by expanding along the first row.\n\nSo:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb) * det(minor of (-\u03bb)) \n      - (1/sqrt(2)) * det(minor of (1/sqrt(2)))\n      + 0 * det(...)\n\nMinor for (-\u03bb) is the 2x2 matrix:\n[\n[-\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb]\n]\nThe determinant of this is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))^2 = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nMinor for (1/sqrt(2)) is the 2x2 matrix:\n[\n[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)],\n[0, -\u03bb]\n]\nDeterminant is (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -\u03bb/(sqrt(2)).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) \n      - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) \n      + 0\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)/2\n\nSecond term: - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (\u03bb/sqrt(2)) = \u03bb/(2)\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb/2) + \u03bb/2 = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2 = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1) = 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, and \u03bb\u00b2 = 1 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.\n\nThe question is, what is the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0 and compute the inner product with the state vector.\n\nBut wait, first let's find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 \u2192 P |v> = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nSo the system of equations is:\n\n1) 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\n2) (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0.\n\n3) 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\nSo from equation 1 and 3, v2 must be zero. From equation 2, v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [v1, 0, v3], where v1 = -v3. Let's choose v3 = a, then v1 = -a. So the eigenvector is [-a, 0, a].\n\nWe can choose a=1 for simplicity, so the eigenvector is [-1, 0, 1], but we can also normalize it if needed.\n\nWait, but we need to ensure that the eigenvector is normalized. Let's compute the norm squared: (-1)^2 + 0^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) * [-1, 0, 1].\n\nSo the eigenvector |\u03c8_0> corresponding to \u03bb=0 is [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\nNow, the system's state is |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).\n\nWait, I should correct that. Earlier, I thought the state was [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, but I think the correct normalized state is each component divided by sqrt(6), so |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nSo the state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nThe probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |\u03c8> and |\u03c8_0>.\n\nSo compute <\u03c8_0 | \u03c8>.\n\nThe inner product is the sum of the products of the corresponding components.\n\nSo:\n\n<\u03c8_0 | \u03c8> = ( (-1/sqrt(2)) )*( -1/sqrt(6) ) + (0)*(2/sqrt(6)) + (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = 1/sqrt(12) = sqrt(3)/6? Wait, sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3), so 1/sqrt(12)=sqrt(3)/6 * 2? Wait, wait. Let me compute sqrt(12): 12=4*3, so sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3). So 1/sqrt(12)=1/(2 sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/(6).\n\nWait, no: 1/(2 sqrt(3)) can be rationalized as sqrt(3)/(6) because multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3): 1/(2 sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/(2*3) )= sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSo first term: ( (-1)/sqrt(2) ) * ( -1/sqrt(6) ) = (1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )= 1/(sqrt(12))= sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSecond term is 0.\n\nThird term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )= 1/(sqrt(12)) = sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSo adding the first and third terms: sqrt(3)/6 + sqrt(3)/6 = (2 sqrt(3))/6 = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, the first term is ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * ( -1/sqrt(6) )= (1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))= 1/(sqrt(12))= sqrt(12)/12= (2 sqrt(3))/12= sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSimilarly, third term is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6))= same as first term, so sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSo the sum is sqrt(3)/6 + sqrt(3)/6 = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nSo the inner product is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = (3)/(9) = 1/3.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the probability is 1/3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1/3, so that would be the answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nDouble-check the eigenvector: for \u03bb=0, we found v2=0, and v1 = -v3. So the eigenvector is [-1,0,1], normalized by 1/sqrt(2). So that's correct.\n\nThe state vector is [-1, 2, 1]/sqrt(6). So when taking the inner product, each component is multiplied. So:\n\n-1/sqrt(2) * (-1/sqrt(6)) = (1)/(sqrt(12)) = sqrt(3)/6.\n\nSimilarly, 1/sqrt(2) * (1/sqrt(6))= same as above.\n\nSum to sqrt(3)/3.\n\nSquared is 1/3.\n\nSo yes, the probability is 1/3. So the answer is option C.\n",

The resulting eigenvector is:\n\\[\n| \\psi_0 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compute the probability of measuring \\( 0 \\)\nThe probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \\( | \\psi \\rangle \\) and \\( | \\psi_0 \\rangle \\):\n\\[\nP(0) = |\\langle \\psi_0 | \\psi \\rangle|^2.\n\\]\nThe inner product is:\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_0 | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nComputing the components:\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_0 | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{6}} \\left[ (-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}} \\left[ 1 + 0 + 1 \\right] = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}.\n\\]\nThe probability is:\n\\[\nP(0) = \\left| \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n**Answer: C**",
