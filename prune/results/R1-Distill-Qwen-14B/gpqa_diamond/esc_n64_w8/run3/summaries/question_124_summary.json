      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. One third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls?\n\nHmm, right. So I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Since these particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame would be longer due to time dilation. But since they decay quickly, the time it takes for them to reach the detector's walls depends on their speed and lifetime.\n\nWait, but how does the Lorentz factor affect how far they travel? Oh, right. The proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) is tau, and the observed lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So the particles will live longer from our perspective, allowing them to travel further before decaying.\n\nThe particles are produced at the center of the detector, so the maximum distance they can travel is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. If a particle's lifetime is such that it can't reach the wall, it will decay before doing so. So the fraction that reaches the wall depends on whether their lifetime allows them to cover 30 meters at their speed.\n\nWait, but the problem states that at a Lorentz factor of ~20, on average, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So for gamma=20, only 1/3 make it. We need to find the gamma that makes 2/3 reach the walls.\n\nI think the key here is to relate the fraction of particles that reach the detector walls to their lifetime. The fraction depends on whether their lifetime is long enough to make the trip. But how?\n\nLet me think. The time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by the speed. The speed can be approximated as the speed of light c, since they're ultra-relativistic. So the time is t = R / (v), and v \u2248 c. So t \u2248 R/(c).\n\nBut the lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So if gamma * tau > t, then the particle will reach the wall. Otherwise, it decays before reaching.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because if the lifetime is longer than the time to reach the wall, then the particle will reach the wall. So the condition is gamma * tau >= t. So the probability of reaching the wall would depend on how much gamma is. But wait, how does the fraction come into play?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay is exponential. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So the probability that it reaches the wall is P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)). But in the current situation, when gamma is 20, P is 1/3. We need to find gamma when P is 2/3.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So when gamma is 20, the probability is 1/3. So setting up the equation:\n\n1/3 = exp(-t/(20 tau))\n\nWe can solve for t/(20 tau) first. Taking natural logs:\n\nln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau)\nSo ln(1/3) is about -1.0986, which equals -t/(20 tau).\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: 1.0986 = t/(20 tau)\nSo t = 20 tau * 1.0986 \u2248 21.97 tau.\n\nBut wait, t is the time it takes to reach the wall, which is R/(v). Since v is approximately c, t = R/(c) = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds. Hmm, wait, 30/(3e8) is 1e-7 seconds. Let me calculate that: 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 s.\n\nSo t = 1e-7 s = 1e-7 s.\n\nWait, but earlier I had t \u2248 21.97 tau. So tau = t/(21.97) = (1e-7 s)/(21.97) \u2248 4.55e-9 s.\n\nHmm, but maybe I don't need to find tau. Because the question is about changing gamma so that the probability becomes 2/3.\n\nSo when gamma is 20, P = 1/3. Now, when gamma is something else, say gamma', we want P' = 2/3.\n\nSo the equation would be 2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma' tau)).\n\nWe can take the natural log of both sides: ln(2/3) = -t/(gamma' tau).\n\nBut from the previous case, we have t/(20 tau) = 1.0986. So t/(tau) = 20 * 1.0986 \u2248 21.972.\n\nSo t = 21.972 tau.\n\nSo substituting into the new equation:\n\nln(2/3) = - t/(gamma' tau) = -(21.972 tau) / (gamma' tau) ) = -21.972 / gamma'.\n\nSo ln(2/3) = -21.972 / gamma'\n\nBut ln(2/3) is about ln(0.6667) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nSo:\n\n-0.4055 = -21.972 / gamma'\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: 0.4055 = 21.972 / gamma'\n\nSo gamma' = 21.972 / 0.4055 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n21.972 divided by 0.4055.\n\nLet me approximate: 21.972 / 0.4 = 54.93. But 0.4055 is a bit more than 0.4, so the result will be a bit less than 54.93.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\n0.4055 * 54 = 21.933. Which is just a bit less than 21.972. The difference is 21.972 -21.933 = 0.039.\n\nSo 0.039 / 0.4055 \u2248 0.096. So 54 + 0.096 \u2248 54.096.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should do a more accurate division.\n\nCompute 21.972 / 0.4055.\n\nLet me compute 0.4055 * 54 = 21.933.\n\nThe difference is 21.972 -21.933=0.039.\n\n0.039 /0.4055 = approximately 0.096.\n\nSo total is 54.096, so approximately 54.1.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, option C is 40, option D is 28. So 54 is an option.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations. Because when gamma increases, the lifetime in the lab frame increases, so more particles should reach the walls. The original gamma was 20, 1/3 reached. We need higher gamma to get 2/3. So the gamma should be higher than 20. So 54 is higher than 20, which makes sense.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't mix up the equations. So the probability P is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), and when gamma is larger, t/(gamma tau) is smaller, so the exponent is less negative, so P is larger. So yes, higher gamma gives higher probability.\n\nIn the first scenario, with gamma=20, P=1/3.\n\nIn the second scenario, we want P=2/3. So the new gamma would be higher, as we said.\n\nSo the calculation gives gamma'\u224854.1. The closest option is A)54.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Let me re-express the equation.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. 1/3 = exp(-t/(20 tau)) \u2192 ln(1/3) = -t/(20 tau) \u2192 t/(20 tau) = ln(3) \u2248 1.0986 \u2192 t =20 tau * 1.0986 \u2248 21.972 tau.\n\n2. 2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma' tau)) \u2192 ln(2/3) = -t/(gamma' tau) \u2192 t/(gamma' tau) = ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nWe know t =21.972 tau, so substituting:\n\n(21.972 tau) / (gamma' tau) )= 0.4055 \u2192 21.972 / gamma' = 0.4055 \u2192 gamma' = 21.972 / 0.4055 \u224854.1.\n\nSo yes, that's correct. So the answer is approximately 54, which is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nThe problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nNow, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D) 28.\n\nWait, so initially, with a Lorentz factor of 20, one third reach the walls. We need to find the new gamma (Lorentz factor) where two-thirds reach. I think this has to do with the particles' lifetime and how far they travel before decaying.\n\nOh right, in relativity, the lifetime of a particle as seen in the lab frame is gamma times its proper lifetime. So if the particles have a proper lifetime tau, then in the lab frame, their lifetime is tau * gamma.\n\nThe particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance they can travel before decaying is gamma * c * tau. Wait, no, because the time they have is their lifetime, so distance is velocity times time. But wait, at ultra-relativistic speeds, velocity is approximately c. So distance is approximately c * gamma * tau.\n\nThe detector's radius is 30 meters, so if the particles travel that far, they reach the wall. So the condition is that the distance they travel, which is c * gamma * tau, should be equal to the radius. But wait, the particles have a certain probability to decay before reaching the wall. The problem says that with gamma=20, only one third reach the wall. So perhaps the average distance they travel is such that one third make it to 30 meters.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the exponential decay. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/(tau)). But wait, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, so t would be gamma tau. Hmm, maybe I should model it with the exponential decay formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the particles have a certain probability P to reach the wall. So the probability that they haven't decayed before traveling the distance R (30m) is P. The distance they travel is v * t, and t is the time they take to reach R. But v is approximately c because they're ultra-relativistic. So t = R/(c). \n\nIn the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau, so the probability that it hasn't decayed yet when it's at the wall is exp(-R/(c tau)). Wait, no, that's not right. Because the time t is R/(v), which is approximately R/(c). So the probability is exp(-t/(tau)), but tau is the proper lifetime. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, so t would be R/(c) = (gamma tau) * (something). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of proper time.\n\nWait, proper time is tau, and the lab frame measures the lifetime as gamma tau. The time for the particle to reach the wall is t = R/(v), which is approximately R/(c) since v is close to c. So the time t in the lab frame is R/(c). The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), because the lifetime is gamma tau. So, the probability P is exp(-R/(c gamma tau)).\n\nWait, maybe I should write it as P = exp(- R/(c gamma tau)).\n\nWait, but when gamma is 20, the probability is 1/3. So when gamma is 20, P = 1/3. So:\n\n1/3 = exp(- R/(c gamma tau))\n\nTaking natural log on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = - R/(c gamma tau)\n\nSo,\n\n- ln(3) = - R/(c gamma tau)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nln(3) = R/(c gamma tau)\n\nSo, gamma tau = R/(c ln 3)\n\nWait, but in our case, the radius R is 30 meters. So for gamma=20, we have:\n\n20 * tau = 30/(c ln 3)\n\nSo, tau = 30/(20 c ln 3) = 3/(2 c ln 3) meters.\n\nWait, but when we change gamma, the tau remains the same, because tau is the proper lifetime. So when gamma changes to a new value, say gamma', the probability P' becomes:\n\nP' = exp(- R/(c gamma' tau))\n\nWe want P' = 2/3.\n\nSo,\n\n2/3 = exp(- R/(c gamma' tau))\n\nTake natural log:\n\nln(2/3) = - R/(c gamma' tau)\n\nSo,\n\nR/(c gamma' tau) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2)\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = R/(c tau ln(3/2))\n\nBut from the previous equation, when gamma was 20, we had gamma tau = R/(c ln 3). So,\n\ngamma tau = R/(c ln 3) \u2192 gamma' = (R/(c tau )) * (1/(ln(3/2)))\n\nBut R/(c tau) is gamma * ln 3 (from gamma tau = R/(c ln3) \u2192 R/(c tau) = gamma ln3 )\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = (gamma ln3) / ( ln(3/2) )\n\nBecause gamma tau = R/(c ln3) \u2192 R/(c tau) = gamma ln3.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = gamma * ( ln3 / ln(3/2) )\n\nHmm, let's compute that.\n\nWe can compute ln3 and ln(3/2).\n\nln3 \u2248 1.0986\n\nln(3/2) = ln1.5 \u2248 0.4055\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' \u2248 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1.0986 / 0.4055 \u2248 2.707\n\n20 * 2.707 \u2248 54.14.\n\nSo, approximately 54. So the answer is A) 54.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The initial gamma is 20, leading to 1/3 reaching. We want 2/3 to reach, which is higher.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nThe problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nNow, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D) 28.\n\nWait, so initially, with a Lorentz factor of 20, one third reach the walls. We need to find the new gamma (Lorentz factor) where two-thirds reach. I think this has to do with the particles' lifetime and how far they travel before decaying.\n\nOh right, in relativity, the lifetime of a particle as seen in the lab frame is gamma times its proper lifetime. So if the particles have a proper lifetime tau, then in the lab frame, their lifetime is tau * gamma.\n\nThe particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance they can travel before decaying is gamma * c * tau. Wait, no, because the time they have is their lifetime, so distance is velocity times time. But wait, at ultra-relativistic speeds, velocity is approximately c. So distance is approximately c * gamma * tau.\n\nThe detector's radius is 30 meters, so if the particles travel that far, they reach the wall. So the condition is that the distance they travel, which is c * gamma * tau, should be equal to the radius. But wait, the particles have a certain probability to decay before reaching the wall. The problem says that with gamma=20, only one third reach the wall. So perhaps the average distance they travel is such that one third make it to 30 meters.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the exponential decay. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/(tau)). But wait, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, so t would be gamma tau. Hmm, maybe I should model it with the exponential decay formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the particles have a certain probability P to reach the wall. So the probability that they haven't decayed before traveling the distance R (30m) is P. The distance they travel is v * t, and t is the time they take to reach R. But v is approximately c because they're ultra-relativistic. So t = R/(c). \n\nIn the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau, so the probability that it hasn't decayed yet when it's at the wall is exp(-R/(c tau)). Wait, no, that's not right. Because the time t is R/(v), which is approximately R/(c). So the probability is exp(-t/(tau)), but tau is the proper lifetime. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, so t would be R/(c) = (gamma tau) * (something). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of proper time.\n\nWait, proper time is tau, and the lab frame measures the lifetime as gamma tau. The time for the particle to reach the wall is t = R/(v), which is approximately R/(c) since v is close to c. So the time t in the lab frame is R/(c). The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), because the lifetime is gamma tau. So, the probability P is exp(-R/(c gamma tau)).\n\nWait, maybe I should write it as P = exp(- R/(c gamma tau)).\n\nWait, but when gamma is 20, the probability is 1/3. So when gamma is 20, P = 1/3. So:\n\n1/3 = exp(- R/(c gamma tau))\n\nTaking natural log on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = - R/(c gamma tau)\n\nSo,\n\n- ln(3) = - R/(c gamma tau)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nln(3) = R/(c gamma tau)\n\nSo, gamma tau = R/(c ln 3)\n\nWait, but in our case, the radius R is 30 meters. So for gamma=20, we have:\n\n20 * tau = 30/(c ln 3)\n\nSo, tau = 30/(20 c ln 3) = 3/(2 c ln 3) meters.\n\nWait, but when we change gamma, the tau remains the same, because tau is the proper lifetime. So when gamma changes to a new value, say gamma', the probability P' becomes:\n\nP' = exp(- R/(c gamma' tau))\n\nWe want P' = 2/3.\n\nSo,\n\n2/3 = exp(- R/(c gamma' tau))\n\nTake natural log:\n\nln(2/3) = - R/(c gamma' tau)\n\nSo,\n\nR/(c gamma' tau) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2)\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = R/(c tau ln(3/2))\n\nBut from the previous equation, when gamma was 20, we had gamma tau = R/(c ln 3). So,\n\ngamma tau = R/(c ln 3) \u2192 gamma' = (R/(c tau )) * (1/(ln(3/2)))\n\nBut R/(c tau) is gamma * ln 3 (from gamma tau = R/(c ln3) \u2192 R/(c tau) = gamma ln3 )\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = (gamma ln3) / ( ln(3/2) )\n\nBecause gamma tau = R/(c ln3) \u2192 R/(c tau) = gamma ln3.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = gamma * ( ln3 / ln(3/2) )\n\nHmm, let's compute that.\n\nWe can compute ln3 and ln(3/2).\n\nln3 \u2248 1.0986\n\nln(3/2) = ln1.5 \u2248 0.4055\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' \u2248 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1.0986 / 0.4055 \u2248 2.707\n\n20 * 2.707 \u2248 54.14.\n\nSo, approximately 54. So the answer is A) 54.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The initial gamma is 20, leading to 1/3 reaching. We want 2/3 to reach, which is higher.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about particles moving at ultra-relativistic velocities and their Lorentz factors. \n\nThe setup is that particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector. Some of them decay quickly and travel to the inner walls. The problem says that currently, with a Lorentz factor of about 20, on average, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls.\n\nWait, so right now, with gamma =20, only one third (\u224833%) get there. We need to find the gamma that makes it two-thirds (\u224866%) reach the walls. \n\nI think this has to do with time dilation and the particles' lifetime. Because if the particles are moving at a high speed, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer. So, if they can travel the distance before decaying, they'll reach the detector's walls.\n\nSo, the distance they need to travel is the radius of the detector, 30 meters. But wait, the particles are moving from the center to the wall, so the distance is 30 meters. \n\nI remember that the proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame observes a longer lifetime due to time dilation: t = gamma * tau. \n\nThe particles will reach the detector walls if they can travel the distance before decaying. So, the time it takes for them to reach the wall is t = distance / velocity. \n\nBut since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their velocity is approximately the speed of light, c. So, t \u2248 r / c. \n\nWait, but the lifetime t must be greater than the proper lifetime tau for the particles to reach the wall. Because if the particle's lifetime is too short, it decays before reaching the wall.\n\nSo, the condition is gamma * tau >= r / c. Because t is gamma * tau, and if that's bigger than r/c, the particle will reach the wall. \n\nWait, but wait. No, actually, the condition is whether the lifetime observed in the lab (t) is sufficient for the particle to reach the wall. So, t must be greater than or equal to the time it takes to reach the wall. \n\nSo, t = gamma * tau >= r / (v). Since v is very close to c, v\u2248c, so r/v \u2248 r/c. \n\nSo, gamma * tau >= r/c. \n\nBut tau is the proper lifetime. So, if the particles' lifetime is just enough to reach the wall when gamma is 20, and only one third reach, perhaps the issue is about the decay probability.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm thinking about it wrong. Maybe the fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on the ratio between their lifetime and the time it takes to reach the wall.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when gamma is 20, one third reach the wall. So, perhaps the probability is related to how much their lifetime is compared to the time to reach the wall.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the average lifetime determines the maximum distance they can travel. So, the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is c * gamma * tau.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The proper lifetime is tau. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = r / (v). Since v is very close to c, t \u2248 r/c. \n\nSo, for the particle to reach the wall, the lab frame lifetime must be at least t. So, gamma * tau >= r/c. \n\nBut when gamma is 20, only one third of the particles make it. So perhaps the average lifetime is such that on average, only a fraction of the particles live long enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle lives longer than t is exp(-t/tau). So the probability that the particle reaches the wall is exp(-r/(gamma c tau)). \n\nWait, that might be the case. Because the probability of decay before time t is 1 - exp(-t/tau). So the survival probability (not decaying) is exp(-t/tau). \n\nIn the lab frame, the time t is r/(v). Since v is approximately c, t \u2248 r/(c). So, the survival probability is exp( - (r/(c)) / (tau) ) = exp( - r/(c tau) ). \n\nBut wait, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So, perhaps I should be using that. So the time for the particle to reach the wall is r/(c). \n\nThe survival probability is exp( - t/(gamma tau) ), because t is the time in the lab frame, and the particle's lifetime is gamma tau in that frame. \n\nWait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me try to write the formula correctly. \n\nThe survival probability P is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by the time it reaches the wall. The decay process is exponential, so P = exp(-t/(tau_lab)), where tau_lab is the lifetime in the lab frame. \n\nBut tau_lab is gamma * tau_rest. So, tau_lab = gamma tau. \n\nSo, the survival probability is exp(- t/(gamma tau) ). \n\nThe time t is the time it takes to reach the wall. Since the particle is moving at speed v \u2248 c, t \u2248 r / c. \n\nSo, P = exp( - (r/(c)) / (gamma tau) ) = exp( - r/(c gamma tau) ). \n\nNow, the problem states that when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So, 1/3 = exp( - 30/(c * 20 * tau) ). \n\nWait, but tau is the proper lifetime, which is the same for all particles. So, the same tau is used for both cases.\n\nWe can write this equation for gamma=20:\n\n1/3 = exp( - 30/(c * 20 * tau) )\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 * tau )\n\nln(1/3) is -ln(3) \u2248 -1.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n-1.0986 = -30/(c * 20 * tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n1.0986 = 30/(20 c tau )\n\nSimplify 30/(20) = 3/2:\n\n1.0986 = (3)/(2 c tau )\n\nSo,\n\n2 c tau = 3/(1.0986 )\n\nCalculate 3 / 1.0986 \u2248 2.73 (since 1.0986 is approximately ln(3)=1.0986, and 3/ln(3) \u2248 2.73)\n\nSo,\n\n2 c tau \u2248 2.73 \u2192 c tau \u2248 1.365.\n\nSo,\n\ntau \u2248 1.365 / c.\n\nBut I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. Let me double-check the steps.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the equation.\n\nWait, the equation is:\n\nln(1/3) = - (30) / (c * 20 * tau )\n\nSo,\n\n- ln(3) = -30/(20 c tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nln(3) = 30/(20 c tau )\n\nSo,\n\n30/(20 c tau ) = ln(3)\n\nSimplify 30/20 = 3/2:\n\n(3)/(2 c tau ) = ln(3 )\n\nSo,\n\nc tau = 3/(2 ln(3) )\n\nCompute 3/(2 * 1.0986) \u2248 3/(2.1972) \u2248 1.365.\n\nSo,\n\nc tau = 1.365.\n\nTau = 1.365 / c.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should proceed to find the relation when the survival probability is 2/3.\n\nSo, the problem asks for the gamma when P = 2/3.\n\nSo, 2/3 = exp( - 30/(c gamma tau ) )\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(c gamma tau )\n\nSo,\n\nln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 -1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\n-0.4055 = -30/(c gamma tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n0.4055 = 30/(c gamma tau )\n\nWe already found that c tau = 1.365 from the first condition. So, substitute c tau =1.365:\n\n0.4055 = 30/( gamma * 1.365 )\n\nMultiply both sides by gamma *1.365:\n\n0.4055 * gamma *1.365 =30\n\nCompute 0.4055 *1.365 \u2248 0.4055 *1.365.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.4 *1.365 = 0.546.\n\n0.0055 *1.365\u2248 ~0.0075.\n\nSo approximately 0.546 + 0.0075= ~0.5535.\n\nSo,\n\n0.5535 * gamma \u2248 30.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma \u2248 30 / 0.5535 \u2248 let's calculate that.\n\n30 divided by 0.5535.\n\nWell, 0.5535 is approximately 0.5535 \u2248 0.5535.\n\n30 / 0.5535 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n0.5535 * 54 = 0.5535 *50=27.675, 0.5535*4=2.214 \u2192 total 29.889.\n\nSo 54 gives about 29.889. Close to 30.\n\nSo, 54 would give 29.889, which is very close to 30.\n\nSo, gamma \u224854.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA)54\n\nB)68\n\nC)40\n\nD)28.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be A)54.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me recheck the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWe had:\n\nFrom gamma=20, P=1/3:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau )\n\nWhich becomes:\n\nln(3) = 30/(20 c tau )\n\nSo,\n\n30/(20 c tau )= ln(3)=1.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n30/(20 * c tau ) =1.0986 \u2192 3/(2 c tau )=1.0986 \u2192 c tau =3/(2 *1.0986)=3/(2.1972)=1.365.\n\nSo c tau is 1.365.\n\nThen for gamma needed to get P=2/3:\n\nln(2/3)= -30/(gamma c tau )\n\nWhich is:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(gamma * 1.365 )\n\nSo,\n\n-0.4055= -30/(1.365 gamma )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n0.4055=30/(1.365 gamma )\n\nThen,\n\ngamma =30/(1.365 * 0.4055 )\n\nCompute denominator: 1.365 * 0.4055.\n\n1.365 * 0.4 = 0.546.\n\n1.365 * 0.0055= approx 0.0075.\n\nSo total denominator is approximately 0.546 +0.0075=0.5535.\n\nSo, 30 / 0.5535 \u224854.18.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 54.18. So the answer is A)54.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about particles moving at ultra-relativistic velocities and their Lorentz factors. \n\nThe setup is that particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector. Some of them decay quickly and travel to the inner walls. The problem says that currently, with a Lorentz factor of about 20, on average, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls.\n\nWait, so right now, with gamma =20, only one third (\u224833%) get there. We need to find the gamma that makes it two-thirds (\u224866%) reach the walls. \n\nI think this has to do with time dilation and the particles' lifetime. Because if the particles are moving at a high speed, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer. So, if they can travel the distance before decaying, they'll reach the detector's walls.\n\nSo, the distance they need to travel is the radius of the detector, 30 meters. But wait, the particles are moving from the center to the wall, so the distance is 30 meters. \n\nI remember that the proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame observes a longer lifetime due to time dilation: t = gamma * tau. \n\nThe particles will reach the detector walls if they can travel the distance before decaying. So, the time it takes for them to reach the wall is t = distance / velocity. \n\nBut since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their velocity is approximately the speed of light, c. So, t \u2248 r / c. \n\nWait, but the lifetime t must be greater than the proper lifetime tau for the particles to reach the wall. Because if the particle's lifetime is too short, it decays before reaching the wall.\n\nSo, the condition is gamma * tau >= r / c. Because t is gamma * tau, and if that's bigger than r/c, the particle will reach the wall. \n\nWait, but wait. No, actually, the condition is whether the lifetime observed in the lab (t) is sufficient for the particle to reach the wall. So, t must be greater than or equal to the time it takes to reach the wall. \n\nSo, t = gamma * tau >= r / (v). Since v is very close to c, v\u2248c, so r/v \u2248 r/c. \n\nSo, gamma * tau >= r/c. \n\nBut tau is the proper lifetime. So, if the particles' lifetime is just enough to reach the wall when gamma is 20, and only one third reach, perhaps the issue is about the decay probability.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm thinking about it wrong. Maybe the fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on the ratio between their lifetime and the time it takes to reach the wall.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when gamma is 20, one third reach the wall. So, perhaps the probability is related to how much their lifetime is compared to the time to reach the wall.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the average lifetime determines the maximum distance they can travel. So, the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is c * gamma * tau.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The proper lifetime is tau. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = r / (v). Since v is very close to c, t \u2248 r/c. \n\nSo, for the particle to reach the wall, the lab frame lifetime must be at least t. So, gamma * tau >= r/c. \n\nBut when gamma is 20, only one third of the particles make it. So perhaps the average lifetime is such that on average, only a fraction of the particles live long enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle lives longer than t is exp(-t/tau). So the probability that the particle reaches the wall is exp(-r/(gamma c tau)). \n\nWait, that might be the case. Because the probability of decay before time t is 1 - exp(-t/tau). So the survival probability (not decaying) is exp(-t/tau). \n\nIn the lab frame, the time t is r/(v). Since v is approximately c, t \u2248 r/(c). So, the survival probability is exp( - (r/(c)) / (tau) ) = exp( - r/(c tau) ). \n\nBut wait, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So, perhaps I should be using that. So the time for the particle to reach the wall is r/(c). \n\nThe survival probability is exp( - t/(gamma tau) ), because t is the time in the lab frame, and the particle's lifetime is gamma tau in that frame. \n\nWait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me try to write the formula correctly. \n\nThe survival probability P is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by the time it reaches the wall. The decay process is exponential, so P = exp(-t/(tau_lab)), where tau_lab is the lifetime in the lab frame. \n\nBut tau_lab is gamma * tau_rest. So, tau_lab = gamma tau. \n\nSo, the survival probability is exp(- t/(gamma tau) ). \n\nThe time t is the time it takes to reach the wall. Since the particle is moving at speed v \u2248 c, t \u2248 r / c. \n\nSo, P = exp( - (r/(c)) / (gamma tau) ) = exp( - r/(c gamma tau) ). \n\nNow, the problem states that when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So, 1/3 = exp( - 30/(c * 20 * tau) ). \n\nWait, but tau is the proper lifetime, which is the same for all particles. So, the same tau is used for both cases.\n\nWe can write this equation for gamma=20:\n\n1/3 = exp( - 30/(c * 20 * tau) )\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 * tau )\n\nln(1/3) is -ln(3) \u2248 -1.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n-1.0986 = -30/(c * 20 * tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n1.0986 = 30/(20 c tau )\n\nSimplify 30/(20) = 3/2:\n\n1.0986 = (3)/(2 c tau )\n\nSo,\n\n2 c tau = 3/(1.0986 )\n\nCalculate 3 / 1.0986 \u2248 2.73 (since 1.0986 is approximately ln(3)=1.0986, and 3/ln(3) \u2248 2.73)\n\nSo,\n\n2 c tau \u2248 2.73 \u2192 c tau \u2248 1.365.\n\nSo,\n\ntau \u2248 1.365 / c.\n\nBut I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. Let me double-check the steps.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the equation.\n\nWait, the equation is:\n\nln(1/3) = - (30) / (c * 20 * tau )\n\nSo,\n\n- ln(3) = -30/(20 c tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nln(3) = 30/(20 c tau )\n\nSo,\n\n30/(20 c tau ) = ln(3)\n\nSimplify 30/20 = 3/2:\n\n(3)/(2 c tau ) = ln(3 )\n\nSo,\n\nc tau = 3/(2 ln(3) )\n\nCompute 3/(2 * 1.0986) \u2248 3/(2.1972) \u2248 1.365.\n\nSo,\n\nc tau = 1.365.\n\nTau = 1.365 / c.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should proceed to find the relation when the survival probability is 2/3.\n\nSo, the problem asks for the gamma when P = 2/3.\n\nSo, 2/3 = exp( - 30/(c gamma tau ) )\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(c gamma tau )\n\nSo,\n\nln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 -1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\n-0.4055 = -30/(c gamma tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n0.4055 = 30/(c gamma tau )\n\nWe already found that c tau = 1.365 from the first condition. So, substitute c tau =1.365:\n\n0.4055 = 30/( gamma * 1.365 )\n\nMultiply both sides by gamma *1.365:\n\n0.4055 * gamma *1.365 =30\n\nCompute 0.4055 *1.365 \u2248 0.4055 *1.365.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.4 *1.365 = 0.546.\n\n0.0055 *1.365\u2248 ~0.0075.\n\nSo approximately 0.546 + 0.0075= ~0.5535.\n\nSo,\n\n0.5535 * gamma \u2248 30.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma \u2248 30 / 0.5535 \u2248 let's calculate that.\n\n30 divided by 0.5535.\n\nWell, 0.5535 is approximately 0.5535 \u2248 0.5535.\n\n30 / 0.5535 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n0.5535 * 54 = 0.5535 *50=27.675, 0.5535*4=2.214 \u2192 total 29.889.\n\nSo 54 gives about 29.889. Close to 30.\n\nSo, 54 would give 29.889, which is very close to 30.\n\nSo, gamma \u224854.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA)54\n\nB)68\n\nC)40\n\nD)28.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be A)54.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me recheck the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWe had:\n\nFrom gamma=20, P=1/3:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau )\n\nWhich becomes:\n\nln(3) = 30/(20 c tau )\n\nSo,\n\n30/(20 c tau )= ln(3)=1.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n30/(20 * c tau ) =1.0986 \u2192 3/(2 c tau )=1.0986 \u2192 c tau =3/(2 *1.0986)=3/(2.1972)=1.365.\n\nSo c tau is 1.365.\n\nThen for gamma needed to get P=2/3:\n\nln(2/3)= -30/(gamma c tau )\n\nWhich is:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(gamma * 1.365 )\n\nSo,\n\n-0.4055= -30/(1.365 gamma )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n0.4055=30/(1.365 gamma )\n\nThen,\n\ngamma =30/(1.365 * 0.4055 )\n\nCompute denominator: 1.365 * 0.4055.\n\n1.365 * 0.4 = 0.546.\n\n1.365 * 0.0055= approx 0.0075.\n\nSo total denominator is approximately 0.546 +0.0075=0.5535.\n\nSo, 30 / 0.5535 \u224854.18.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 54.18. So the answer is A)54.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the survival probability of particles traveling from the center of a spherical detector to its inner walls.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Hmm. Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced which travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nWait, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls. So, I think the problem is about the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the particles' ability to reach the detector's walls. \n\nI remember that in particle physics, when particles are created, their lifetime affects how far they can travel before decaying. The detector's size would limit the maximum distance a particle can travel. So, if a particle's lifetime is too short, it might decay before reaching the detector walls, but if it's longer, more particles would reach the walls.\n\nOh right, the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is related to the observed lifetime in the lab frame by the Lorentz factor gamma. So the longer the lifetime (higher gamma), the more time the particle has to travel, and the farther it can go.\n\nWait, but how does this relate to the fraction reaching the detector walls? I think it's about the velocity and the time the particle exists. So, the distance a particle travels is velocity multiplied by the lifetime.\n\nWait, but in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. So, the distance traveled is velocity * gamma * proper lifetime. Or, since the velocity is a significant fraction of c, maybe we can approximate it as c times gamma times the proper lifetime.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, so their velocity is approximately c. So, the distance they can travel before decaying is approximately c * gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.\n\nSo, the radius of the detector is 30 meters. So, for a particle to reach the inner walls, the distance it needs to travel is 30 meters. So, the maximum distance a particle can travel is 30 m.\n\nSo, the condition is c * gamma * tau >= 30 m. Because if the product is greater, the particle can reach the wall before decaying.\n\nNow, in the initial scenario, gamma is 20, and one third of the particles reach the wall. So, let's model this.\n\nLet's say the proper lifetime is tau. So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. The time available for the particle to travel is the same as the lab frame's lifetime, right? Because the particle is created at the center and needs to reach the wall before decaying.\n\nWait, maybe the distance is c multiplied by the lab lifetime (gamma tau) multiplied by velocity. Wait, velocity is v, but since it's ultra-relativistic, v \u2248 c. So, distance D = v * gamma tau = c * gamma tau.\n\nWait, but actually, the time the particle has is its lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma tau. So, the distance it can travel is v * gamma tau. Since v is close to c, we can approximate it as c * gamma tau.\n\nSo, for the particle to reach the detector wall, which is 30 meters away, the distance D must be at least 30 meters.\n\nSo, D = c * gamma tau >= 30 m.\n\nSo, if a particle's D is >=30 m, it will reach the wall. So, the probability depends on the distribution of gamma values? Or perhaps it's more about the average.\n\nWait, the initial condition says that with gamma ~20, one third of the particles reach the walls. So, perhaps the average gamma is 20, but the actual gamma varies, and the probability that a particle's gamma is sufficient to reach the wall is one third.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the decay length. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The decay length L is c * gamma * tau. So, if L is greater than or equal to 30 meters, the particle has a chance to reach the wall.\n\nWait, but the problem says that on average, one third reach the wall when gamma is 20. So, perhaps the decay length when gamma is 20 is such that only one third of the particles have L >=30 m. But that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the particles have a distribution of gamma values. Or perhaps the decay follows an exponential distribution based on the lifetime. Wait, maybe it's a matter of the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it's traveled 30 meters.\n\nWait, the probability that a particle survives for a time t is given by the exponential decay law: P(t) = e^(-t/(tau)). But in the lab frame, the time is t = distance / velocity. Since velocity is approximately c, t \u2248 D/c.\n\nWait, but in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma tau. So, the time available is t = 30 m / c.\n\nWait, let me think again. The particle is created at the center, so it needs to travel 30 meters to reach the wall. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = 30 m / c. But the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed yet when it reaches the wall is P = e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no, because the time t is the time it takes to reach the wall, and the particle's lifetime is gamma tau. So, the probability that it hasn't decayed when it arrives is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo, in the initial case, gamma is 20, and the probability that a particle reaches the wall is one third (1/3). So,\n\n1/3 = e^(- t/(20 tau) )\n\nWe can solve for t/(20 tau) in terms of ln(1/3). Because 1/3 is e^(-x) implies x = ln(3).\n\nWait, wait, ln(1/3) is negative. So,\n\nt/(20 tau) = -ln(1/3) = ln(3).\n\nSo,\n\nt = 20 tau ln(3)\n\nBut t is also 30 m / c.\n\nSo,\n\n30 m / c = 20 tau ln(3) \u2192 tau = (30)/(20 c ln(3)).\n\nBut I'm not sure if I'm going the right way. Let's think about the second part. We need the Lorentz factor gamma such that the probability of reaching the wall is two-thirds (2/3).\n\nSo,\n\n2/3 = e^(- t/(gamma tau) )\n\nTaking natural logarithm,\n\nln(2/3) = - t/(gamma tau)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n- ln(2/3) = t/(gamma tau)\n\nBut t is 30/c, so:\n\n- ln(2/3) = (30/c)/(gamma tau )\n\nBut from the first part, when gamma was 20, we had:\n\nt = 20 tau ln(3) \u2192 30/c = 20 tau ln(3)\n\nSo, tau = (30)/(20 c ln(3)).\n\nNow, substituting tau into the second equation:\n\n- ln(2/3) = (30/c) / (gamma * (30/(20 c ln(3))) ) )\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\ngamma * (30/(20 c ln(3))) ) = (gamma *30) / (20 c ln(3)) )\n\nSo, (30/c) divided by that is (30/c) * (20 c ln(3))/(30 gamma )\n\nSimplify:\n\n(30 * 20 c ln(3) ) / (c *30 gamma ) ) \u2192 (20 ln(3)) / gamma.\n\nSo,\n\n- ln(2/3) = (20 ln(3)) / gamma \u2192 gamma = (20 ln(3)) / (- ln(2/3) )\n\nCompute the numerical values.\n\nFirst, ln(3) is about 1.0986.\n\nln(2/3) is ln(2) - ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 - 1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma = (20 * 1.0986 ) / (0.4055 ) \u2192 because denominator is -ln(2/3) which is 0.4055.\n\nCompute numerator: 20 * 1.0986 \u2248 21.972.\n\nDivide by 0.4055: 21.972 / 0.4055 \u2248 54.15.\n\nSo, gamma is approximately 54.15. Looking at the options, option A is 54, option B is 68, etc.\n\nSo the answer should be option A)54.\n\nWait, but wait a minute.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Hmm. Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced which travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nWait, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls. So, I think the problem is about the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the particles' ability to reach the detector's walls. \n\nI remember that in particle physics, when particles are created, their lifetime affects how far they can travel before decaying. The detector's size would limit the maximum distance a particle can travel. So, if a particle's lifetime is too short, it might decay before reaching the detector walls, but if it's longer, more particles would reach the walls.\n\nOh right, the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is related to the observed lifetime in the lab frame by the Lorentz factor gamma. So the longer the lifetime (higher gamma), the more time the particle has to travel, and the farther it can go.\n\nWait, but how does this relate to the fraction reaching the detector walls? I think it's about the velocity and the time the particle exists. So, the distance a particle travels is velocity multiplied by the lifetime.\n\nWait, but in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. So, the distance traveled is velocity * gamma * proper lifetime. Or, since the velocity is a significant fraction of c, maybe we can approximate it as c times gamma times the proper lifetime.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, so their velocity is approximately c. So, the distance they can travel before decaying is approximately c * gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.\n\nSo, the radius of the detector is 30 meters. So, for a particle to reach the inner walls, the distance it needs to travel is 30 meters. So, the maximum distance a particle can travel is 30 m.\n\nSo, the condition is c * gamma * tau >= 30 m. Because if the product is greater, the particle can reach the wall before decaying.\n\nNow, in the initial scenario, gamma is 20, and one third of the particles reach the wall. So, let's model this.\n\nLet's say the proper lifetime is tau. So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. The time available for the particle to travel is the same as the lab frame's lifetime, right? Because the particle is created at the center and needs to reach the wall before decaying.\n\nWait, maybe the distance is c multiplied by the lab lifetime (gamma tau) multiplied by velocity. Wait, velocity is v, but since it's ultra-relativistic, v \u2248 c. So, distance D = v * gamma tau = c * gamma tau.\n\nWait, but actually, the time the particle has is its lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma tau. So, the distance it can travel is v * gamma tau. Since v is close to c, we can approximate it as c * gamma tau.\n\nSo, for the particle to reach the detector wall, which is 30 meters away, the distance D must be at least 30 meters.\n\nSo, D = c * gamma tau >= 30 m.\n\nSo, if a particle's D is >=30 m, it will reach the wall. So, the probability depends on the distribution of gamma values? Or perhaps it's more about the average.\n\nWait, the initial condition says that with gamma ~20, one third of the particles reach the walls. So, perhaps the average gamma is 20, but the actual gamma varies, and the probability that a particle's gamma is sufficient to reach the wall is one third.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the decay length. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The decay length L is c * gamma * tau. So, if L is greater than or equal to 30 meters, the particle has a chance to reach the wall.\n\nWait, but the problem says that on average, one third reach the wall when gamma is 20. So, perhaps the decay length when gamma is 20 is such that only one third of the particles have L >=30 m. But that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the particles have a distribution of gamma values. Or perhaps the decay follows an exponential distribution based on the lifetime. Wait, maybe it's a matter of the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it's traveled 30 meters.\n\nWait, the probability that a particle survives for a time t is given by the exponential decay law: P(t) = e^(-t/(tau)). But in the lab frame, the time is t = distance / velocity. Since velocity is approximately c, t \u2248 D/c.\n\nWait, but in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma tau. So, the time available is t = 30 m / c.\n\nWait, let me think again. The particle is created at the center, so it needs to travel 30 meters to reach the wall. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = 30 m / c. But the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed yet when it reaches the wall is P = e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no, because the time t is the time it takes to reach the wall, and the particle's lifetime is gamma tau. So, the probability that it hasn't decayed when it arrives is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo, in the initial case, gamma is 20, and the probability that a particle reaches the wall is one third (1/3). So,\n\n1/3 = e^(- t/(20 tau) )\n\nWe can solve for t/(20 tau) in terms of ln(1/3). Because 1/3 is e^(-x) implies x = ln(3).\n\nWait, wait, ln(1/3) is negative. So,\n\nt/(20 tau) = -ln(1/3) = ln(3).\n\nSo,\n\nt = 20 tau ln(3)\n\nBut t is also 30 m / c.\n\nSo,\n\n30 m / c = 20 tau ln(3) \u2192 tau = (30)/(20 c ln(3)).\n\nBut I'm not sure if I'm going the right way. Let's think about the second part. We need the Lorentz factor gamma such that the probability of reaching the wall is two-thirds (2/3).\n\nSo,\n\n2/3 = e^(- t/(gamma tau) )\n\nTaking natural logarithm,\n\nln(2/3) = - t/(gamma tau)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n- ln(2/3) = t/(gamma tau)\n\nBut t is 30/c, so:\n\n- ln(2/3) = (30/c)/(gamma tau )\n\nBut from the first part, when gamma was 20, we had:\n\nt = 20 tau ln(3) \u2192 30/c = 20 tau ln(3)\n\nSo, tau = (30)/(20 c ln(3)).\n\nNow, substituting tau into the second equation:\n\n- ln(2/3) = (30/c) / (gamma * (30/(20 c ln(3))) ) )\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\ngamma * (30/(20 c ln(3))) ) = (gamma *30) / (20 c ln(3)) )\n\nSo, (30/c) divided by that is (30/c) * (20 c ln(3))/(30 gamma )\n\nSimplify:\n\n(30 * 20 c ln(3) ) / (c *30 gamma ) ) \u2192 (20 ln(3)) / gamma.\n\nSo,\n\n- ln(2/3) = (20 ln(3)) / gamma \u2192 gamma = (20 ln(3)) / (- ln(2/3) )\n\nCompute the numerical values.\n\nFirst, ln(3) is about 1.0986.\n\nln(2/3) is ln(2) - ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 - 1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma = (20 * 1.0986 ) / (0.4055 ) \u2192 because denominator is -ln(2/3) which is 0.4055.\n\nCompute numerator: 20 * 1.0986 \u2248 21.972.\n\nDivide by 0.4055: 21.972 / 0.4055 \u2248 54.15.\n\nSo, gamma is approximately 54.15.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles and detectors. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.\n\nWait, so the detector's radius is 30 meters, so the maximum distance a particle can travel is 30 meters. But the particles are moving at a certain speed, right? Oh, but since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed is close to the speed of light. So, the time it takes for them to reach the wall depends on their speed and the distance.\n\nBut wait, the problem involves the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor gamma is defined as gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So, higher gamma means the particles are moving closer to the speed of light.\n\nThe key here must be how the particles' lifetime relates to the time it takes for them to reach the detector wall. Because particles that decay before reaching the wall won't make it. So, the fraction that reaches the wall depends on their lifetime and their speed.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when the Lorentz factor is ~20, one third reach the wall. Now, we need to find the gamma that makes two-thirds reach the wall.\n\nI think the particles' lifetime in the lab frame (the detector's frame) is gamma times their proper lifetime. Let me call the proper lifetime tau. So, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nThe time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by the speed. Since the particles are moving at speed v, which is approximately c for ultra-relativistic, so time t = R / v \u2248 R / c.\n\nSo, for a particle to reach the wall, its lifetime in the lab frame must be at least t. So, the condition is gamma * tau >= t.\n\nWait, but wait. The probability that a particle reaches the wall would be the ratio of the time it takes to reach the wall to the particle's lifetime. Because if the particle's lifetime is shorter than the time it takes to reach the wall, it will decay before reaching. So, the fraction that makes it is the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than t.\n\nBut since the particles are produced at the center and decay with a certain lifetime, perhaps the fraction that reaches the wall is the ratio of t to the mean lifetime. Wait, no, because particles decay exponentially. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(tau)). So, the fraction that reaches the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no, the lab frame's lifetime is gamma tau, so the proper time is tau. So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So, the probability that a particle hasn't decayed when it travels a distance R is exp(- R/(v gamma tau)).\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the time it takes. The time taken to reach the wall is t = R/(v). So, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So, if gamma tau >= t, the particle would have enough time to reach the wall. But since v is close to c, t is approximately R/c.\n\nWait, but more accurately, v is beta*c, where beta is v/c. So, t = R/(beta c). The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau.\n\nSo, the condition for the particle to reach the wall is gamma tau >= t = R/(beta c).\n\nWait, but beta is related to gamma. Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).\n\nHmm, but perhaps I can express everything in terms of gamma. Let me try that.\n\nSo, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). So, 1/beta = 1 / sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = gamma / sqrt(gamma^2 -1).\n\nSo, t = R/(beta c) = R/(c) * 1/(beta) = R/(c) * gamma / sqrt(gamma^2 -1).\n\nSo, the condition for the particle to reach the wall is gamma tau >= t.\n\nWait, but no. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. So, the time the particle has is gamma tau. The time to reach the wall is t = R/(beta c). So, if gamma tau >= t, the particle can reach the wall before decaying.\n\nSo, the fraction of particles that reach the wall is the probability that their lifetime is longer than t, which is the same as exp(- t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no. Because in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma tau. So, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it has traveled for time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo, the fraction that reaches the wall is exp(- t/(gamma tau)).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that when gamma is 20, one third reach the wall. So, when gamma=20, the fraction is 1/3. So,\n\n1/3 = exp( - t/(20 tau) )\n\nHmm, but what is t? t is R/(beta c). Let's plug that in.\n\n1/3 = exp( - (R/(beta c)) / (20 tau) )\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the fraction of particles that reach the wall is the ratio of the time it takes them to reach the wall to their lifetime, but in their own frame. Wait, no, because it's about their lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction is the ratio of the distance they can travel before decaying divided by the detector's radius. So, the distance a particle can travel before decaying is v * (gamma tau). Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, so the distance is v * gamma tau.\n\nSo, if this distance is greater than or equal to R, the particle will reach the wall.\n\nSo, the fraction that reaches the wall is the probability that v * gamma tau >= R.\n\nBut since v is approximately c, but more accurately, v = beta c.\n\nSo, the distance is beta c * gamma tau.\n\nSo, the condition is beta c gamma tau >= R.\n\nBut we can express beta in terms of gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).\n\nSo, beta gamma = gamma sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(gamma^2 (1 - 1/gamma^2 )) ) = sqrt( gamma^2 - 1 )\n\nSo, beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1 )\n\nSo, the condition becomes sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) * c tau >= R.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let's go back. The maximum distance the particle can travel before decaying is v * lifetime. The lifetime is gamma tau. So, distance is v gamma tau.\n\nSo, if v gamma tau >= R, the particle will reach the wall.\n\nSo, the fraction that reaches the wall is the probability that v gamma tau >= R.\n\nBut since the decay is exponential, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed before traveling R is exp( - R/(v gamma tau) ).\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than R/(v gamma tau) ? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the proper time.\n\nWait, perhaps the proper time tau is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So, the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = R/(v), which is R/(beta c).\n\nSo, the time t must be less than or equal to the lab frame lifetime. So, t <= gamma tau.\n\nSo, R/(beta c) <= gamma tau.\n\nRearranging, R <= beta c gamma tau.\n\nBut beta c gamma is beta gamma c. And beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1).\n\nSo, R <= c sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) tau.\n\nBut perhaps I can express this as R/(c tau) <= sqrt(gamma^2 -1 )\n\nSo, sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) >= R/(c tau )\n\nSo, gamma^2 -1 >= (R/(c tau ))^2\n\nWhich gives gamma^2 >= 1 + (R/(c tau ))^2\n\nBut wait, I don't know what tau is. But perhaps I can relate the cases when gamma is 20 and when gamma is the desired value.\n\nIn the first case, when gamma is 20, the fraction of particles reaching the wall is 1/3. So,\n\n1/3 = fraction = exp( - R/(v gamma tau) )\n\nWait, because the fraction is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t, which is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nHmm, let me think again. When gamma is 20, the fraction is 1/3.\n\nSo,\n\n1/3 = exp( - (R/(beta c)) / (20 tau) )\n\nBut I don't know tau. Maybe I can express it in terms of R, c, and gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps for gamma=20, the condition is that R/(beta c) = 20 tau * ln(3), since exp(-x) = 1/3 when x = ln(3).\n\nWait, let's solve 1/3 = exp(- t/(gamma tau) )\n\nTaking natural log on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = - t/(gamma tau )\n\n=> -ln(3) = - t/(gamma tau )\n\n=> t = gamma tau ln(3)\n\nt is R/(beta c), so:\n\nR/(beta c) = gamma tau ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\ngamma tau = R/(beta c ln(3) )\n\nBut beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )\n\nSo,\n\ngamma tau = R/( c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) ln(3) )\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the fraction is (gamma tau) / (t) ), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the proper time. The time the particle experiences is tau, because in its rest frame, it lives for tau. But the distance it travels in its own frame is zero, because it's at rest. So, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the mean lifetime in the lab frame as gamma tau. So, the average lifetime is longer. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = R/(v). So, if t is less than gamma tau, then the particle has a higher chance of reaching the wall.\n\nBut the exact probability would be the exponential decay function. So, the fraction reaching the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo, when gamma is 20, 1/3 of the particles reach the wall. So,\n\n1/3 = exp(- t/(20 tau) )\n\nTaking natural logs,\n\nln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau )\n\n=> t/(20 tau) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\nt = 20 tau ln(3)\n\nBut t is R/(v) = R/(beta c) = R/( sqrt(1 - 1/20^2 ) c )\n\nBecause beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 1/400) \u2248 0.999875.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute beta gamma.\n\nWait, beta gamma = gamma * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 ) = sqrt( gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2 ) ) = sqrt( gamma^2 - 1 )\n\nSo, for gamma =20, beta gamma = sqrt(400 -1 )= sqrt(399) \u2248 19.975, which is approximately 20.\n\nSo, beta gamma \u2248 gamma.\n\nSo, beta gamma \u2248 20.\n\nSo, beta gamma c tau = R.\n\nWait, let's see. Because from t = R/(beta c) = (R)/(beta c )\n\nAnd from the previous equation, t = gamma tau ln(3 )\n\nSo,\n\nR/(beta c ) = gamma tau ln(3 )\n\nMultiply both sides by beta c:\n\nR = gamma tau beta c ln(3 )\n\nBut beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ), so beta = sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2 )\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express it in terms of beta gamma.\n\nWait, because beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ), as I noted before.\n\nSo, beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1 )\n\nSo, R = gamma tau beta c ln(3 )\n\nBut beta c = (sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2 )) c.\n\nSo, beta c gamma = gamma * sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2 ) c = sqrt( gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2 )) c = sqrt( gamma^2 -1 ) c.\n\nSo, R = gamma tau * (beta c) * ln(3 )\n\nBut beta c gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) c.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting too tangled here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWhen gamma is 20, the fraction is 1/3. Let me call gamma1 =20, fraction1=1/3.\n\nWe need to find gamma2 such that fraction2=2/3.\n\nSo, for gamma2, the fraction is exp( - t/(gamma2 tau) )\n\nBut t is the same, because the detector radius R and c are the same. Wait, no. Wait, t is R/(v), and v depends on gamma.\n\nWait, no, v is a function of gamma. So, t for gamma2 is R/(beta2 c ), where beta2 is sqrt(1-1/gamma2^2 )\n\nSo, let's write the equations for both cases.\n\nCase 1: gamma1=20, fraction1=1/3.\n\nSo,\n\n1/3 = exp( - (R/(beta1 c )) / (gamma1 tau) )\n\nCase 2: gamma2= ?, fraction2=2/3.\n\n2/3 = exp( - (R/(beta2 c )) / (gamma2 tau) )\n\nSo, let's take the ratio of the two equations.\n\n(2/3) / (1/3) ) = exp( [ (R/(beta1 c ) )/(gamma1 tau) - (R/(beta2 c )) / (gamma2 tau) ] )\n\nSimplify left side: 2.\n\nRight side: exp( [ R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau) - R/(beta2 c gamma2 tau) ] )\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\nln(2) = [ R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau) - R/(beta2 c gamma2 tau) ]\n\nFactor out R/(c tau):\n\nln(2) = (R/(c tau)) [ 1/(beta1 gamma1 ) - 1/(beta2 gamma2 ) ]\n\nBut from case 1,\n\n1/3 = exp( - R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau) )\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = - R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau )\n\n=> R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau) = ln(3 )\n\nSo, ln(3 ) = R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau )\n\nSo, substituting this into the previous equation,\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ 1/(beta1 gamma1 ) - 1/(beta2 gamma2 ) ]\n\nWait, because (R/(c tau)) [ ... ] becomes ln(3 ) [ ... ].\n\nSo,\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ 1/(beta1 gamma1 ) - 1/(beta2 gamma2 ) ]\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nBut beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ), as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, beta1 gamma1 = sqrt(gamma1^2 -1 ) \u2248 gamma1 when gamma1 is large.\n\nBecause for gamma1=20,\n\nsqrt(400-1)=sqrt(399)=~19.975, which is about 20. So, beta1 gamma1 \u2248 gamma1.\n\nSimilarly for gamma2.\n\nSo, beta1 gamma1 \u2248 gamma1.\n\nSo,\n\n1/(beta1 gamma1 ) \u2248 1/gamma1.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n1/(beta2 gamma2 ) \u2248 1/gamma2.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation,\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ (1/gamma1 ) - (1/gamma2 ) ]\n\nWe can rearrange this,\n\n(1/gamma2 ) = (1/gamma1 ) + ( ln(2)/ln(3) )\n\nWait, because:\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ (1/gamma1 ) - (1/gamma2 ) ]\n\nDivide both sides by ln(3):\n\nln(2)/ln(3) = (1/gamma1 ) - (1/gamma2 )\n\nSo,\n\n(1/gamma2 ) = (1/gamma1 ) - (ln(2)/ln(3) )\n\nWait, but that would give a negative value if 1/gamma1 is smaller than ln(2)/ln(3). Let me compute the values.\n\nWait, ln(2) is about 0.6931, ln(3) is about 1.0986. So, ln(2)/ln(3) \u2248 0.6309.\n\nGamma1 is 20, so 1/gamma1 is 0.05.\n\nSo,\n\n(1/gamma2 ) = 0.05 - 0.6309 = -0.5809.\n\nThat's negative, which doesn't make sense because gamma is positive. So, this approach must be wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a wrong assumption by approximating beta gamma as gamma. Perhaps I shouldn't make that approximation, especially since gamma is 20, but the factor is significant when gamma changes.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nWe have,\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ 1/(beta1 gamma1 ) - 1/(beta2 gamma2 ) ]\n\nBut,\n\nbeta1 gamma1 = sqrt(gamma1^2 -1 )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nbeta2 gamma2 = sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nSo,\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ 1/sqrt(gamma1^2 -1 ) - 1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) ]\n\nLet me plug in gamma1=20,\n\nsqrt(20^2 -1 )=sqrt(399)\u224819.975.\n\nSo,\n\nln(2) \u2248 ln(3) [ 1/19.975 - 1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) ]\n\nCompute 1/19.975 \u2248 0.05006.\n\nSo,\n\nln(2)/ln(3) \u2248 0.6309.\n\nSo,\n\n0.6309 \u2248 0.05006 - 1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nWait, no. Let me write the equation again.\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ 1/(beta1 gamma1 ) - 1/(beta2 gamma2 ) ]\n\nWhich is,\n\nln(2) \u2248 1.0986 [ 0.05006 - 1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) ]\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute the left side:\n\nln(2) \u2248 0.6931.\n\nSo,\n\n0.6931 \u2248 1.0986 [ 0.05006 - 1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) ]\n\nDivide both sides by 1.0986:\n\n0.6931 / 1.0986 \u2248 0.05006 - 1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nCompute 0.6931/1.0986 \u2248 0.6309.\n\nSo,\n\n0.6309 \u2248 0.05006 - 1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nRearranging,\n\n1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) \u2248 0.05006 - 0.6309 \u2248 -0.5808.\n\nHmm, that's negative again. Which can't be right because sqrt(gamma^2 -1) is positive, so 1/sqrt(...) is positive. So, this suggests a mistake in the approach.\n\nI think perhaps the initial assumption that the fraction is exp(-t/(gamma tau)) is incorrect. Maybe I should consider that the particles that reach the wall have their lifetime longer than the time taken to reach the wall. But the probability is the fraction of particles with lifetime longer than t. So, perhaps it's 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because the fraction that hasn't decayed is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), so the fraction that have decayed is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, but in the problem, when gamma=20, one third reach the wall. So, 1/3 is the fraction that reach, which would be the fraction that hasn't decayed. So,\n\n1/3 = exp( - t/(gamma tau) )\n\nWait, so when gamma is 20,\n\n1/3 = exp( - (R/(beta1 c )) / (gamma1 tau) )\n\nSo, taking ln,\n\nln(1/3) = - (R/(beta1 c )) / (gamma1 tau )\n\n=> (R/(beta1 c )) / (gamma1 tau ) = ln(3 )\n\n=> R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau ) = ln(3 )\n\nNow, for the desired case, gamma2, the fraction is 2/3. So,\n\n2/3 = exp( - t2/(gamma2 tau) )\n\n=> ln(2/3) = - t2/(gamma2 tau )\n\n=> t2/(gamma2 tau ) = ln(3/2 )\n\nBecause ln(2/3) = - ln(3/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nt2 = gamma2 tau ln(3/2 )\n\nBut t2 is R/(beta2 c )\n\nSo,\n\nR/(beta2 c ) = gamma2 tau ln(3/2 )\n\nBut from the first case, R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau ) = ln(3 )\n\nSo, R = beta1 c gamma1 tau ln(3 )\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation,\n\nbeta1 c gamma1 tau ln(3 ) / (beta2 c ) = gamma2 tau ln(3/2 )\n\nSimplify,\n\nbeta1 gamma1 ln(3 ) / beta2 = gamma2 ln(3/2 )\n\nDivide both sides by tau and c, which cancel out.\n\nSo,\n\n(beta1 gamma1 ln(3 )) / beta2 = gamma2 ln(3/2 )\n\nWe can write beta2 as sqrt(1 -1/gamma2^2 )\n\nAnd beta1 is sqrt(1 -1/gamma1^2 ) = sqrt(1 -1/400) \u2248 0.999875.\n\nSo, let's plug in the known values.\n\ngamma1 =20.\n\nbeta1 = sqrt(1 -1/(20)^2 ) = sqrt(399/400 ) = sqrt(0.9975) \u2248 0.99875.\n\ngamma1 =20.\n\nSo,\n\n(0.99875 * 20 * ln(3 )) / sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2 ) = gamma2 ln(3/2 )\n\nCompute the left side numerator:\n\n0.99875 *20 \u2248 19.975.\n\nln(3 )\u22481.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n19.975 *1.0986 \u2248 21.93.\n\nSo, left side numerator is ~21.93.\n\nDivide by sqrt(1 -1/gamma2^2 ), which is beta2 gamma2 = sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nSo,\n\n21.93 / sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) = gamma2 * ln(3/2 )\n\nln(3/2 )\u22480.4055.\n\nSo,\n\n21.93 / sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) = gamma2 * 0.4055.\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ):\n\n21.93 = 0.4055 gamma2 sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\n(21.93)^2 = (0.4055)^2 gamma2^2 (gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nCompute 21.93^2: 21.93 *21.93 \u2248 480.9.\n\n(0.4055)^2 \u2248 0.1644.\n\nSo,\n\n480.9 \u2248 0.1644 gamma2^2 (gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nLet me denote x = gamma2^2.\n\nSo,\n\n480.9 \u2248 0.1644 x (x -1 )\n\n=> 480.9 \u2248 0.1644 (x^2 -x )\n\nMultiply both sides by 1/0.1644:\n\n480.9 /0.1644 \u2248 x^2 -x\n\nCompute 480.9 /0.1644 \u2248 2926.\n\nSo,\n\nx^2 -x -2926 \u2248 0.\n\nSolve for x using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 +4*2926 ) ] /2\n\nCompute sqrt(1 + 11704 ) = sqrt(11705 )\u2248 108.18.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [1 + 108.18 ] /2 \u2248 109.18/2 \u224854.59.\n\nSo, x \u224854.59 \u2192 gamma2^2 \u224854.59 \u2192 gamma2 \u2248 sqrt(54.59 ) \u22487.389.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the initial gamma is 20, and we're looking for a higher gamma to have more particles reach the wall. Because if gamma increases, the particles are moving faster and have longer lifetimes, so more should reach the wall.\n\nWait, but the result I'm getting is gamma2\u22487.389, which is lower than 20. That can't be right because when gamma is lower, particles are slower and have shorter lab lifetimes, so fewer should reach the wall. But the question asks for two-thirds to reach, which is more than the current one third. So, the required gamma should be higher than 20.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back through the steps.\n\nWhen I substituted the equations, perhaps I messed up the substitution.\n\nWait, the two equations were:\n\nFrom case 1:\n\nR = beta1 c gamma1 tau ln(3 )\n\nFrom case 2:\n\nR = beta2 c gamma2 tau ln(3/2 )\n\nSo, equate them:\n\nbeta1 c gamma1 tau ln(3 ) = beta2 c gamma2 tau ln(3/2 )\n\nCancel c, tau:\n\nbeta1 gamma1 ln(3 ) = beta2 gamma2 ln(3/2 )\n\nSo,\n\n(beta1 gamma1 ) / (beta2 gamma2 ) ) = ln(3/2 ) / ln(3 )\n\nCompute the right side:\n\nln(3/2 ) \u22480.4055, ln(3 )\u22481.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n0.4055 /1.0986 \u22480.369.\n\nSo,\n\n(beta1 gamma1 )/(beta2 gamma2 ) ) \u22480.369.\n\nBut,\n\nbeta1 gamma1 = sqrt(gamma1^2 -1 ) \u2248 gamma1 when gamma is large.\n\nSimilarly, beta2 gamma2 = sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nSo,\n\ngamma1 / sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) \u22480.369.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma1 \u22480.369 sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\ngamma1^2 \u22480.1361 (gamma2^2 -1 )\n\ngamma1^2 =400.\n\nSo,\n\n400 \u22480.1361 (gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nDivide both sides by 0.1361:\n\ngamma2^2 -1 \u2248400 /0.1361 \u22482938.5.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma2^2 \u22482939.5 \u2192 gamma2 \u2248sqrt(2939.5 )\u224854.22.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So gamma2 is approximately 54.22.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, option B is68, C is40, D is28.\n\nSo, the closest is option A:54.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles and detectors. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.\n\nWait, so the detector's radius is 30 meters, so the maximum distance a particle can travel is 30 meters. But the particles are moving at a certain speed, right? Oh, but since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed is close to the speed of light. So, the time it takes for them to reach the wall depends on their speed and the distance.\n\nBut wait, the problem involves the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor gamma is defined as gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So, higher gamma means the particles are moving closer to the speed of light.\n\nThe key here must be how the particles' lifetime relates to the time it takes for them to reach the detector wall. Because particles that decay before reaching the wall won't make it. So, the fraction that reaches the wall depends on their lifetime and their speed.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when the Lorentz factor is ~20, one third reach the wall. Now, we need to find the gamma that makes two-thirds reach the wall.\n\nI think the particles' lifetime in the lab frame (the detector's frame) is gamma times their proper lifetime. Let me call the proper lifetime tau. So, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nThe time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by the speed. Since the particles are moving at speed v, which is approximately c for ultra-relativistic, so time t = R / v \u2248 R / c.\n\nSo, for a particle to reach the wall, its lifetime in the lab frame must be at least t. So, the condition is gamma * tau >= t.\n\nWait, but wait. The probability that a particle reaches the wall would be the ratio of the time it takes to reach the wall to the particle's lifetime. Because if the particle's lifetime is shorter than the time it takes to reach the wall, it will decay before reaching. So, the fraction that makes it is the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than t.\n\nBut since the particles are produced at the center and decay with a certain lifetime, perhaps the fraction that reaches the wall is the ratio of t to the mean lifetime. Wait, no, because particles decay exponentially. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(tau)). So, the fraction that reaches the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no, the lab frame's lifetime is gamma tau, so the proper time is tau. So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So, the probability that a particle hasn't decayed when it travels a distance R is exp(- R/(v gamma tau)).\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the time it takes. The time taken to reach the wall is t = R/(v). So, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So, if gamma tau >= t, the particle would have enough time to reach the wall. But since v is close to c, t is approximately R/c.\n\nWait, but more accurately, v is beta*c, where beta is v/c. So, t = R/(beta c). The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau.\n\nSo, the condition for the particle to reach the wall is gamma tau >= t = R/(beta c).\n\nWait, but beta is related to gamma. Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).\n\nHmm, but perhaps I can express everything in terms of gamma. Let me try that.\n\nSo, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). So, 1/beta = 1 / sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = gamma / sqrt(gamma^2 -1).\n\nSo, t = R/(beta c) = R/(c) * 1/(beta) = R/(c) * gamma / sqrt(gamma^2 -1).\n\nSo, the condition for the particle to reach the wall is gamma tau >= t.\n\nWait, but no. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. So, the time the particle has is gamma tau. The time to reach the wall is t = R/(beta c). So, if gamma tau >= t, the particle can reach the wall before decaying.\n\nSo, the fraction of particles that reach the wall is the probability that their lifetime is longer than t, which is the same as exp(- t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no. Because in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma tau. So, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it has traveled for time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo, the fraction that reaches the wall is exp(- t/(gamma tau)).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that when gamma is 20, one third reach the wall. So, when gamma=20, the fraction is 1/3. So,\n\n1/3 = exp( - t/(20 tau) )\n\nHmm, but what is t? t is R/(beta c). Let's plug that in.\n\n1/3 = exp( - (R/(beta c)) / (20 tau) )\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the fraction of particles that reach the wall is the ratio of the time it takes them to reach the wall to their lifetime, but in their own frame. Wait, no, because it's about their lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction is the ratio of the distance they can travel before decaying divided by the detector's radius. So, the distance a particle can travel before decaying is v * (gamma tau). Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, so the distance is v * gamma tau.\n\nSo, if this distance is greater than or equal to R, the particle will reach the wall.\n\nSo, the fraction that reaches the wall is the probability that v * gamma tau >= R.\n\nBut since v is approximately c, but more accurately, v = beta c.\n\nSo, the distance is beta c * gamma tau.\n\nSo, the condition is beta c gamma tau >= R.\n\nBut we can express beta in terms of gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).\n\nSo, beta gamma = gamma sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(gamma^2 (1 - 1/gamma^2 )) ) = sqrt( gamma^2 - 1 )\n\nSo, beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1 )\n\nSo, the condition becomes sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) * c tau >= R.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let's go back. The maximum distance the particle can travel before decaying is v * lifetime. The lifetime is gamma tau. So, distance is v gamma tau.\n\nSo, if v gamma tau >= R, the particle will reach the wall.\n\nSo, the fraction that reaches the wall is the probability that v gamma tau >= R.\n\nBut since the decay is exponential, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed before traveling R is exp( - R/(v gamma tau) ).\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than R/(v gamma tau) ? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the proper time.\n\nWait, perhaps the proper time tau is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So, the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = R/(v), which is R/(beta c).\n\nSo, the time t must be less than or equal to the lab frame lifetime. So, t <= gamma tau.\n\nSo, R/(beta c) <= gamma tau.\n\nRearranging, R <= beta c gamma tau.\n\nBut beta c gamma is beta gamma c. And beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1).\n\nSo, R <= c sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) tau.\n\nBut perhaps I can express this as R/(c tau) <= sqrt(gamma^2 -1 )\n\nSo, sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) >= R/(c tau )\n\nSo, gamma^2 -1 >= (R/(c tau ))^2\n\nWhich gives gamma^2 >= 1 + (R/(c tau ))^2\n\nBut wait, I don't know what tau is. But perhaps I can relate the cases when gamma is 20 and when gamma is the desired value.\n\nIn the first case, when gamma is 20, the fraction of particles reaching the wall is 1/3. So,\n\n1/3 = fraction = exp( - R/(v gamma tau) )\n\nWait, because the fraction is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t, which is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nHmm, let me think again. When gamma is 20, the fraction is 1/3.\n\nSo,\n\n1/3 = exp( - (R/(beta c)) / (20 tau) )\n\nBut I don't know tau. Maybe I can express it in terms of R, c, and gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps for gamma=20, the condition is that R/(beta c) = 20 tau * ln(3), since exp(-x) = 1/3 when x = ln(3).\n\nWait, let's solve 1/3 = exp(- t/(gamma tau) )\n\nTaking natural log on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = - t/(gamma tau )\n\n=> -ln(3) = - t/(gamma tau )\n\n=> t = gamma tau ln(3)\n\nt is R/(beta c), so:\n\nR/(beta c) = gamma tau ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\ngamma tau = R/(beta c ln(3) )\n\nBut beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )\n\nSo,\n\ngamma tau = R/( c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) ln(3) )\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the fraction is (gamma tau) / (t) ), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the proper time. The time the particle experiences is tau, because in its rest frame, it lives for tau. But the distance it travels in its own frame is zero, because it's at rest. So, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the mean lifetime in the lab frame as gamma tau. So, the average lifetime is longer. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = R/(v). So, if t is less than gamma tau, then the particle has a higher chance of reaching the wall.\n\nBut the exact probability would be the exponential decay function. So, the fraction reaching the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo, when gamma is 20, 1/3 of the particles reach the wall. So,\n\n1/3 = exp(- t/(20 tau) )\n\nTaking natural logs,\n\nln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau )\n\n=> t/(20 tau) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\nt = 20 tau ln(3)\n\nBut t is R/(v) = R/(beta c) = R/( sqrt(1 - 1/20^2 ) c )\n\nBecause beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 1/400) \u2248 0.999875.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute beta gamma.\n\nWait, beta gamma = gamma * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 ) = sqrt( gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2 ) ) = sqrt( gamma^2 - 1 )\n\nSo, for gamma =20, beta gamma = sqrt(400 -1 )= sqrt(399) \u2248 19.975, which is approximately 20.\n\nSo, beta gamma \u2248 gamma.\n\nSo, beta gamma \u2248 20.\n\nSo, beta gamma c tau = R.\n\nWait, let's see. Because from t = R/(beta c) = (R)/(beta c )\n\nAnd from the previous equation, t = gamma tau ln(3 )\n\nSo,\n\nR/(beta c ) = gamma tau ln(3 )\n\nMultiply both sides by beta c:\n\nR = gamma tau beta c ln(3 )\n\nBut beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ), so beta = sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2 )\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express it in terms of beta gamma.\n\nWait, because beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ), as I noted before.\n\nSo, beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1 )\n\nSo, R = gamma tau beta c ln(3 )\n\nBut beta c = (sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2 )) c.\n\nSo, beta c gamma = gamma * sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2 ) c = sqrt( gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2 )) c = sqrt( gamma^2 -1 ) c.\n\nSo, R = gamma tau * (beta c) * ln(3 )\n\nBut beta c gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) c.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting too tangled here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWhen gamma is 20, the fraction is 1/3. Let me call gamma1 =20, fraction1=1/3.\n\nWe need to find gamma2 such that fraction2=2/3.\n\nSo, for gamma2, the fraction is exp( - t/(gamma2 tau) )\n\nBut t is the same, because the detector radius R and c are the same. Wait, no. Wait, t is R/(v), and v depends on gamma.\n\nWait, no, v is a function of gamma. So, t for gamma2 is R/(beta2 c ), where beta2 is sqrt(1-1/gamma2^2 )\n\nSo, let's write the equations for both cases.\n\nCase 1: gamma1=20, fraction1=1/3.\n\nSo,\n\n1/3 = exp( - (R/(beta1 c )) / (gamma1 tau) )\n\nCase 2: gamma2= ?, fraction2=2/3.\n\n2/3 = exp( - (R/(beta2 c )) / (gamma2 tau) )\n\nSo, let's take the ratio of the two equations.\n\n(2/3) / (1/3) ) = exp( [ (R/(beta1 c ) )/(gamma1 tau) - (R/(beta2 c )) / (gamma2 tau) ] )\n\nSimplify left side: 2.\n\nRight side: exp( [ R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau) - R/(beta2 c gamma2 tau) ] )\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\nln(2) = [ R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau) - R/(beta2 c gamma2 tau) ]\n\nFactor out R/(c tau):\n\nln(2) = (R/(c tau)) [ 1/(beta1 gamma1 ) - 1/(beta2 gamma2 ) ]\n\nBut from case 1,\n\n1/3 = exp( - R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau) )\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = - R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau )\n\n=> R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau) = ln(3 )\n\nSo, ln(3 ) = R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau )\n\nSo, substituting this into the previous equation,\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ 1/(beta1 gamma1 ) - 1/(beta2 gamma2 ) ]\n\nWait, because (R/(c tau)) [ ... ] becomes ln(3 ) [ ... ].\n\nSo,\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ 1/(beta1 gamma1 ) - 1/(beta2 gamma2 ) ]\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nBut beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ), as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, beta1 gamma1 = sqrt(gamma1^2 -1 ) \u2248 gamma1 when gamma1 is large.\n\nBecause for gamma1=20,\n\nsqrt(400-1)=sqrt(399)=~19.975, which is about 20. So, beta1 gamma1 \u2248 gamma1.\n\nSimilarly for gamma2.\n\nSo, beta1 gamma1 \u2248 gamma1.\n\nSo,\n\n1/(beta1 gamma1 ) \u2248 1/gamma1.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n1/(beta2 gamma2 ) \u2248 1/gamma2.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation,\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ (1/gamma1 ) - (1/gamma2 ) ]\n\nWe can rearrange this,\n\n(1/gamma2 ) = (1/gamma1 ) + ( ln(2)/ln(3) )\n\nWait, because:\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ (1/gamma1 ) - (1/gamma2 ) ]\n\nDivide both sides by ln(3):\n\nln(2)/ln(3) = (1/gamma1 ) - (1/gamma2 )\n\nSo,\n\n(1/gamma2 ) = (1/gamma1 ) - (ln(2)/ln(3) )\n\nWait, but that would give a negative value if 1/gamma1 is smaller than ln(2)/ln(3). Let me compute the values.\n\nWait, ln(2) is about 0.6931, ln(3) is about 1.0986. So, ln(2)/ln(3) \u2248 0.6309.\n\nGamma1 is 20, so 1/gamma1 is 0.05.\n\nSo,\n\n(1/gamma2 ) = 0.05 - 0.6309 = -0.5809.\n\nThat's negative, which doesn't make sense because gamma is positive. So, this approach must be wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a wrong assumption by approximating beta gamma as gamma. Perhaps I shouldn't make that approximation, especially since gamma is 20, but the factor is significant when gamma changes.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nWe have,\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ 1/(beta1 gamma1 ) - 1/(beta2 gamma2 ) ]\n\nBut,\n\nbeta1 gamma1 = sqrt(gamma1^2 -1 )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nbeta2 gamma2 = sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nSo,\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ 1/sqrt(gamma1^2 -1 ) - 1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) ]\n\nLet me plug in gamma1=20,\n\nsqrt(20^2 -1 )=sqrt(399)\u224819.975.\n\nSo,\n\nln(2) \u2248 ln(3) [ 1/19.975 - 1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) ]\n\nCompute 1/19.975 \u2248 0.05006.\n\nSo,\n\nln(2)/ln(3) \u2248 0.6309.\n\nSo,\n\n0.6309 \u2248 0.05006 - 1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nWait, no. Let me write the equation again.\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ 1/(beta1 gamma1 ) - 1/(beta2 gamma2 ) ]\n\nWhich is,\n\nln(2) \u2248 1.0986 [ 0.05006 - 1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) ]\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute the left side:\n\nln(2) \u2248 0.6931.\n\nSo,\n\n0.6931 \u2248 1.0986 [ 0.05006 - 1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) ]\n\nDivide both sides by 1.0986:\n\n0.6931 / 1.0986 \u2248 0.05006 - 1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nCompute 0.6931/1.0986 \u2248 0.6309.\n\nSo,\n\n0.6309 \u2248 0.05006 - 1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nRearranging,\n\n1/sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) \u2248 0.05006 - 0.6309 \u2248 -0.5808.\n\nHmm, that's negative again. Which can't be right because sqrt(gamma^2 -1) is positive, so 1/sqrt(...) is positive. So, this suggests a mistake in the approach.\n\nI think perhaps the initial assumption that the fraction is exp(-t/(gamma tau)) is incorrect. Maybe I should consider that the particles that reach the wall have their lifetime longer than the time taken to reach the wall. But the probability is the fraction of particles with lifetime longer than t. So, perhaps it's 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because the fraction that hasn't decayed is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), so the fraction that have decayed is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, but in the problem, when gamma=20, one third reach the wall. So, 1/3 is the fraction that reach, which would be the fraction that hasn't decayed. So,\n\n1/3 = exp( - t/(gamma tau) )\n\nWait, so when gamma is 20,\n\n1/3 = exp( - (R/(beta1 c )) / (gamma1 tau) )\n\nSo, taking ln,\n\nln(1/3) = - (R/(beta1 c )) / (gamma1 tau )\n\n=> (R/(beta1 c )) / (gamma1 tau ) = ln(3 )\n\n=> R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau ) = ln(3 )\n\nNow, for the desired case, gamma2, the fraction is 2/3. So,\n\n2/3 = exp( - t2/(gamma2 tau) )\n\n=> ln(2/3) = - t2/(gamma2 tau )\n\n=> t2/(gamma2 tau ) = ln(3/2 )\n\nBecause ln(2/3) = - ln(3/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nt2 = gamma2 tau ln(3/2 )\n\nBut t2 is R/(beta2 c )\n\nSo,\n\nR/(beta2 c ) = gamma2 tau ln(3/2 )\n\nBut from the first case, R/(beta1 c gamma1 tau ) = ln(3 )\n\nSo, R = beta1 c gamma1 tau ln(3 )\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation,\n\nbeta1 c gamma1 tau ln(3 ) / (beta2 c ) = gamma2 tau ln(3/2 )\n\nSimplify,\n\nbeta1 gamma1 ln(3 ) / beta2 = gamma2 ln(3/2 )\n\nDivide both sides by tau and c, which cancel out.\n\nSo,\n\n(beta1 gamma1 ln(3 )) / beta2 = gamma2 ln(3/2 )\n\nWe can write beta2 as sqrt(1 -1/gamma2^2 )\n\nAnd beta1 is sqrt(1 -1/gamma1^2 ) = sqrt(1 -1/400) \u2248 0.999875.\n\nSo, let's plug in the known values.\n\ngamma1 =20.\n\nbeta1 = sqrt(1 -1/(20)^2 ) = sqrt(399/400 ) = sqrt(0.9975) \u2248 0.99875.\n\ngamma1 =20.\n\nSo,\n\n(0.99875 * 20 * ln(3 )) / sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2 ) = gamma2 ln(3/2 )\n\nCompute the left side numerator:\n\n0.99875 *20 \u2248 19.975.\n\nln(3 )\u22481.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n19.975 *1.0986 \u2248 21.93.\n\nSo, left side numerator is ~21.93.\n\nDivide by sqrt(1 -1/gamma2^2 ), which is beta2 gamma2 = sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nSo,\n\n21.93 / sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) = gamma2 * ln(3/2 )\n\nln(3/2 )\u22480.4055.\n\nSo,\n\n21.93 / sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) = gamma2 * 0.4055.\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ):\n\n21.93 = 0.4055 gamma2 sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\n(21.93)^2 = (0.4055)^2 gamma2^2 (gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nCompute 21.93^2: 21.93 *21.93 \u2248 480.9.\n\n(0.4055)^2 \u2248 0.1644.\n\nSo,\n\n480.9 \u2248 0.1644 gamma2^2 (gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nLet me denote x = gamma2^2.\n\nSo,\n\n480.9 \u2248 0.1644 x (x -1 )\n\n=> 480.9 \u2248 0.1644 (x^2 -x )\n\nMultiply both sides by 1/0.1644:\n\n480.9 /0.1644 \u2248 x^2 -x\n\nCompute 480.9 /0.1644 \u2248 2926.\n\nSo,\n\nx^2 -x -2926 \u2248 0.\n\nSolve for x using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 +4*2926 ) ] /2\n\nCompute sqrt(1 + 11704 ) = sqrt(11705 )\u2248 108.18.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [1 + 108.18 ] /2 \u2248 109.18/2 \u224854.59.\n\nSo, x \u224854.59 \u2192 gamma2^2 \u224854.59 \u2192 gamma2 \u2248 sqrt(54.59 ) \u22487.389.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the initial gamma is 20, and we're looking for a higher gamma to have more particles reach the wall. Because if gamma increases, the particles are moving faster and have longer lifetimes, so more should reach the wall.\n\nWait, but the result I'm getting is gamma2\u22487.389, which is lower than 20. That can't be right because when gamma is lower, particles are slower and have shorter lab lifetimes, so fewer should reach the wall. But the question asks for two-thirds to reach, which is more than the current one third. So, the required gamma should be higher than 20.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back through the steps.\n\nWhen I substituted the equations, perhaps I messed up the substitution.\n\nWait, the two equations were:\n\nFrom case 1:\n\nR = beta1 c gamma1 tau ln(3 )\n\nFrom case 2:\n\nR = beta2 c gamma2 tau ln(3/2 )\n\nSo, equate them:\n\nbeta1 c gamma1 tau ln(3 ) = beta2 c gamma2 tau ln(3/2 )\n\nCancel c, tau:\n\nbeta1 gamma1 ln(3 ) = beta2 gamma2 ln(3/2 )\n\nSo,\n\n(beta1 gamma1 ) / (beta2 gamma2 ) ) = ln(3/2 ) / ln(3 )\n\nCompute the right side:\n\nln(3/2 ) \u22480.4055, ln(3 )\u22481.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n0.4055 /1.0986 \u22480.369.\n\nSo,\n\n(beta1 gamma1 )/(beta2 gamma2 ) ) \u22480.369.\n\nBut,\n\nbeta1 gamma1 = sqrt(gamma1^2 -1 ) \u2248 gamma1 when gamma is large.\n\nSimilarly, beta2 gamma2 = sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nSo,\n\ngamma1 / sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 ) \u22480.369.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma1 \u22480.369 sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\ngamma1^2 \u22480.1361 (gamma2^2 -1 )\n\ngamma1^2 =400.\n\nSo,\n\n400 \u22480.1361 (gamma2^2 -1 )\n\nDivide both sides by 0.1361:\n\ngamma2^2 -1 \u2248400 /0.1361 \u22482938.5.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma2^2 \u22482939.5 \u2192 gamma2 \u2248sqrt(2939.5 )\u224854.22.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So gamma2 is approximately 54.22.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, option B is68, C is40, D is28.\n\nSo, the closest is option A:54.\n\n\nTo determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the particles' lifetimes, their velocities, and the detector's geometry. The key equations involve the exponential decay probability and the time it takes for particles to travel the detector's radius.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n\n1. **Fraction of Particles Reaching the Wall**:  \n   The fraction of particles that reach the detector's inner walls is given by the exponential decay formula:  \n   \\[\n   f = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\gamma \\tau}\\right)\n   \\]  \n   where \\(t = \\frac{R}{v}\\) is the time it takes for a particle to travel the detector's radius \\(R\\), \\(v = \\beta c\\) is the particle's velocity, \\(\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}\\) is the Lorentz factor, and \\(\\tau\\) is the proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n2. **Case 1 (Given)**:  \n   When \\(\\gamma_1 = 20\\), one-third of the particles reach the wall.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nSo, particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and these travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.\n\nHmm. I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). And when particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their velocity is very close to the speed of light. So gamma is large.\n\nWait, but how does the Lorentz factor relate to the particles reaching the detector's walls? I think it's about the time it takes for the particles to decay or reach the detector. Because if a particle decays before reaching the wall, it won't be detected. So the problem must be about the proper lifetime of the particle and how time dilation affects how far it can travel.\n\nRight, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. From our lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma times. So the particles with higher gamma will live longer and have a better chance to reach the detector walls.\n\nThe setup is that initially, with gamma around 20, only one third of the particles reach the walls. So I need to find a new gamma where two-thirds reach the walls.\n\nWait, but why does the fraction change with gamma? Oh, because as gamma increases, the particles' lifetime increases, so more of them can reach the detector walls before decaying. So higher gamma should mean a higher fraction of particles reaching the walls.\n\nSo the initial situation: gamma1 = 20, fraction f1 = 1/3 (33.3% reach the walls).\n\nWe need to find gamma2 such that f2 = 2/3 (66.6% reach the walls).\n\nBut how do we relate the fraction of particles reaching the detector walls to gamma?\n\nHmm, perhaps it's about the velocity and the time available for the particle to reach the wall before decaying. The time available is the time it takes for the particle to travel from the center to the wall, which is the radius divided by the velocity.\n\nWait, the radius is 30 meters. So the distance each particle has to travel is 30 meters, but from the center, so the path is 30 meters. Or wait, no, the detector is spherical, so the particles are emitted in all directions. But regardless, the maximum distance a particle can travel is the radius of the detector. So any particle that decays before traveling 30 meters won't reach the wall.\n\nWait, but the particles are produced at the center, right? So the maximum distance to the wall is 30 meters. So the time available for the particle to reach the wall is t = 30 / v.\n\nAnd the lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.\n\nSo for a particle to reach the wall, the condition is that gamma * tau >= t. Because if the lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall, then it will reach before decaying.\n\nWait, but wait, if the lifetime is gamma * tau, then the probability of decay is based on the exponential decay law. The number of particles that survive (reach the wall) would be e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, I think that's the right approach. So the fraction of particles that reach the wall is the probability that they decay after time t. So the survival probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no. Because the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle lives longer than time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo in the initial case, when gamma is 20, the fraction of particles that reach the wall is 1/3, which equals exp(-t/(20 tau)).\n\nIn the desired case, the fraction is 2/3, so 2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma2 tau)).\n\nBut wait, wait, is t the same in both cases? Because t is the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall, which is 30 meters / v. But v is approximately c, since the particles are ultra-relativistic.\n\nSo v \u2248 c. Therefore, t \u2248 30 / c. Let's compute that. c is about 3e8 meters per second. So t \u2248 30 / 3e8 = 1e-7 seconds, or 1e-7 s.\n\nWait, but in terms of gamma and tau, how does this tie in?\n\nSo let's set up the equations.\n\nCase 1: gamma1 = 20. Fraction f1 = 1/3 = exp(- t/(gamma1 tau)).\n\nCase 2: gamma2 = ? Fraction f2 = 2/3 = exp(- t/(gamma2 tau)).\n\nWe can take the ratio of the two equations to eliminate t and tau.\n\nBecause f2 / f1 = [exp(-t/(gamma2 tau))] / [exp(-t/(gamma1 tau))] ) = exp( t (1/gamma1 tau - 1/gamma2 tau) ) ) = exp( t ( (gamma2 - gamma1) ) / (gamma1 gamma2 tau) ) )\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to take the logarithm of each equation.\n\nFrom case 1:\n\nln(f1) = - t/(gamma1 tau)\n\nSimilarly, ln(f2) = - t/(gamma2 tau)\n\nSo we can write:\n\nln(f1) = - t/(gamma1 tau) --> equation (1)\n\nln(f2) = - t/(gamma2 tau) --> equation (2)\n\nIf we divide equation (1) by equation (2):\n\nln(f1)/ln(f2) = [ - t/(gamma1 tau) ] / [ - t/(gamma2 tau) ] ) = (gamma2 tau) / (gamma1 tau) ) = gamma2 / gamma1\n\nSo ln(f1)/ln(f2) = gamma2 / gamma1\n\nWait, but wait, no: let's compute it correctly.\n\nWait, equation (1): ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau)\n\nEquation (2): ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma2 tau)\n\nDivide equation (1) by equation (2):\n\n[ ln(1/3) ] / [ ln(2/3) ] = [ (- t/(20 tau)) ] / [ (- t/(gamma2 tau)) ] \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n= [ (1/(20 tau)) ] / [ (1/(gamma2 tau)) ] ) = gamma2 / 20\n\nSo:\n\nln(1/3) / ln(2/3) = gamma2 / 20\n\nHmm, let's compute the left side.\n\nCompute ln(1/3) = ln(1) - ln(3) = 0 - ln(3) \u2248 -1.0986\n\nln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 - 1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055\n\nSo ln(1/3)/ln(2/3) \u2248 (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) \u2248 2.7095\n\nSo 2.7095 = gamma2 / 20\n\nSo gamma2 = 20 * 2.7095 \u2248 54.19\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, which is close. So the needed gamma is approximately 54.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the math.\n\nWait, ln(1/3) is ln(0.3333) \u2248 -1.0986\n\nln(2/3) is ln(0.6667) \u2248 -0.4055\n\nSo ln(1/3)/ln(2/3) = (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) \u2248 2.7095\n\nYes, so 2.7095 = gamma2 / 20 \u2192 gamma2 = 20 * 2.7095 \u2248 54.19, which rounds to 54.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. Alright, so particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities. Their Lorentz factor is around 20 on average. \n\nWait, the problem says that about one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. So we need to find the Lorentz factor that increases the fraction from 1/3 to 2/3.\n\nHmm, I remember that when particles decay, their decay products can reach certain distances depending on their velocity and lifetime. Oh right, this must have something to do with the concept of time dilation in relativity. Because particles moving at relativistic speeds will have their lifetimes as seen from the lab frame (the detector's frame) longer than their proper lifetime. So, the faster they go, the longer they live, the farther they can travel before decaying.\n\nSo, the particles are produced at the center of the sphere. The inner walls are 30 meters away. So the maximum distance a particle can travel is 30 meters. If a particle decays before reaching the wall, its decay products might not hit the detector. But in this case, the question is about the parent particles themselves reaching the wall. Wait, no, the question says these are new particles that are fast-decaying. So perhaps when they decay, their decay products (maybe like pions) would move and hit the detector. But the problem states that the particles themselves reach the inner walls, but they're fast-decaying. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me read again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"Particles are collided at the center... producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls.\"\n\nOh, so the produced particles are the ones that are fast-decaying. So, the lifetime is such that only some of them reach the walls. So their lifetime determines how far they go. So, the proper lifetime (tau) is fixed for each particle. But in the lab frame, their lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. So the distance they can travel is velocity multiplied by their lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nWait, but velocity is a function of the Lorentz factor. For ultra-relativistic particles, v is approximately c. So beta is approximately 1. So beta is v/c \u2248 1.\n\nThe distance a particle travels before decaying is L = beta * c * gamma * tau. Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2), and beta is close to 1, gamma is the Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, but if the detector radius is 30 meters, then L must be at least 30 meters for the particle to reach the wall. So, the condition is beta gamma c tau >= 30 meters.\n\nBut wait, for a given tau, the probability that the particle decays after traveling a distance x is given by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle lives long enough to reach distance L is exp(-L/(beta gamma c tau)).\n\nWait, let me think. The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(tau)). But in the lab frame, t is gamma multiplied by the proper time. The proper time for the particle to reach L is t' = L/(beta c), because in the particle's frame, it's at rest and the lab is moving. So the proper time is L/(beta c). So the time in the lab frame is gamma * t', so t = gamma * L/(beta c).\n\nSubstituting into the decay probability: P = exp(- t/(tau)) = exp(- gamma L/(beta c tau)).\n\nWait, no, the proper lifetime is tau. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the time the particle has to reach the wall is t = L/(beta c). So if t < gamma tau, the particle hasn't decayed yet when it reaches the wall. The probability that it doesn't decay is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), but wait, no. Wait, the decay probability is P = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of mean lifetime. The mean path length (average distance) a particle can travel is c * tau * beta gamma. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, so the average distance is beta c * gamma tau.\n\nSo, the probability that a particle lives long enough to reach a distance L is given by the exponential distribution: P(L) = exp(- L/(beta gamma c tau)).\n\nWait, but if the average path length is lambda = beta gamma c tau, then the probability that the particle travels more than L is P = exp(- L / lambda).\n\nSo in the original case, the radius is 30 meters. At Lorentz factor gamma1=20, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So P1 = 1/3 = exp(-30/(beta gamma1 c tau)).\n\nWait, but beta is approximately 1 since the particles are ultra-relativistic. So beta \u2248 1, so we can ignore it in the denominator for approximation. So P1 = exp(-30/(gamma1 c tau)).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(gamma1 c tau)\n=> 30/(gamma1 c tau) = ln(3) \u2248 1.0986\nSo gamma1 c tau = 30 / 1.0986 \u2248 27.3 meters.\n\nWait, but gamma1 is given as 20. So gamma1 c tau = 20 * c tau = 27.3 m. So c tau = 27.3 / 20 = 1.365 meters.\n\nWait, but c is approximately 3e8 m/s, so tau would be 1.365 / (3e8) \u2248 4.55e-9 seconds. That's the proper lifetime of the particle. But I'm not sure if I need to compute tau, but perhaps I can relate the two scenarios.\n\nNow, the question is, what gamma2 is needed so that P2 = 2/3, i.e., exp(-30/(gamma2 c tau)) = 2/3.\n\nTaking natural logs:\n\n-30/(gamma2 c tau) = ln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n30/(gamma2 c tau) = 0.4055.\n\nSo, gamma2 c tau = 30 / 0.4055 \u2248 74.02.\n\nBut from the first scenario, we have gamma1 c tau = 27.3.\n\nSo gamma2 c tau = 74.02.\n\nSo gamma2 = (gamma1 c tau) * (74.02)/(27.3) ) / gamma1 c tau? Wait, no. Wait, gamma1 c tau =27.3. So gamma2 = (74.02) * (gamma1 c tau) / (27.3 * c tau) )? No, wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWe have from the first case: gamma1 c tau = 27.3.\n\nIn the second case: gamma2 c tau = 74.02.\n\nSo gamma2 = (74.02) / (27.3) ) * gamma1.\n\nWait, because gamma1 c tau is 27.3. So gamma2 c tau = 74.02 = (74.02/27.3) * gamma1 c tau.\n\nSo gamma2 = (74.02 / 27.3) * gamma1.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because gamma2 c tau is 74.02, and gamma1 c tau is 27.3, so gamma2 = (74.02 / 27.3) * gamma1.\n\nWait, gamma1 is 20. So 74.02 / 27.3 \u2248 2.71.\n\nSo gamma2 \u2248 20 * 2.71 \u2248 54.2.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, which is close. So the answer would be A) 54.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. So the initial condition gives gamma1 c tau = 27.3. The second condition requires gamma2 c tau = 74.02. So gamma2 = (74.02) / (27.3) * gamma1.\n\nWait, no, because gamma1 c tau = 27.3, so c tau = 27.3 / gamma1.\n\nThen gamma2 c tau = gamma2 * (27.3 / gamma1) ) = 74.02.\n\nSo gamma2 = (74.02 * gamma1) / 27.3.\n\nGamma1 is 20. So 74.02 * 20 = 1480.4. Divided by 27.3: 1480.4 /27.3 \u2248 54.25. So approximately 54.25, which is option A, 54.\n\nSo the needed gamma is approximately 54.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. Alright, so particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities. Their Lorentz factor is around 20 on average. \n\nWait, the problem says that about one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. So we need to find the Lorentz factor that increases the fraction from 1/3 to 2/3.\n\nHmm, I remember that when particles decay, their decay products can reach certain distances depending on their velocity and lifetime. Oh right, this must have something to do with the concept of time dilation in relativity. Because particles moving at relativistic speeds will have their lifetimes as seen from the lab frame (the detector's frame) longer than their proper lifetime. So, the faster they go, the longer they live, the farther they can travel before decaying.\n\nSo, the particles are produced at the center of the sphere. The inner walls are 30 meters away. So the maximum distance a particle can travel is 30 meters. If a particle decays before reaching the wall, its decay products might not hit the detector. But in this case, the question is about the parent particles themselves reaching the wall. Wait, no, the question says these are new particles that are fast-decaying. So perhaps when they decay, their decay products (maybe like pions) would move and hit the detector. But the problem states that the particles themselves reach the inner walls, but they're fast-decaying. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me read again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"Particles are collided at the center... producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls.\"\n\nOh, so the produced particles are the ones that are fast-decaying. So, the lifetime is such that only some of them reach the walls. So their lifetime determines how far they go. So, the proper lifetime (tau) is fixed for each particle. But in the lab frame, their lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. So the distance they can travel is velocity multiplied by their lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nWait, but velocity is a function of the Lorentz factor. For ultra-relativistic particles, v is approximately c. So beta is approximately 1. So beta is v/c \u2248 1.\n\nThe distance a particle travels before decaying is L = beta * c * gamma * tau. Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2), and beta is close to 1, gamma is the Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, but if the detector radius is 30 meters, then L must be at least 30 meters for the particle to reach the wall. So, the condition is beta gamma c tau >= 30 meters.\n\nBut wait, for a given tau, the probability that the particle decays after traveling a distance x is given by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle lives long enough to reach distance L is exp(-L/(beta gamma c tau)).\n\nWait, let me think. The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(tau)). But in the lab frame, t is gamma multiplied by the proper time. The proper time for the particle to reach L is t' = L/(beta c), because in the particle's frame, it's at rest and the lab is moving. So the proper time is L/(beta c). So the time in the lab frame is gamma * t', so t = gamma * L/(beta c).\n\nSubstituting into the decay probability: P = exp(- t/(tau)) = exp(- gamma L/(beta c tau)).\n\nWait, no, the proper lifetime is tau. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the time the particle has to reach the wall is t = L/(beta c). So if t < gamma tau, the particle hasn't decayed yet when it reaches the wall. The probability that it doesn't decay is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), but wait, no. Wait, the decay probability is P = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of mean lifetime. The mean path length (average distance) a particle can travel is c * tau * beta gamma. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, so the average distance is beta c * gamma tau.\n\nSo, the probability that a particle lives long enough to reach a distance L is given by the exponential distribution: P(L) = exp(- L/(beta gamma c tau)).\n\nWait, but if the average path length is lambda = beta gamma c tau, then the probability that the particle travels more than L is P = exp(- L / lambda).\n\nSo in the original case, the radius is 30 meters. At Lorentz factor gamma1=20, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So P1 = 1/3 = exp(-30/(beta gamma1 c tau)).\n\nWait, but beta is approximately 1 since the particles are ultra-relativistic. So beta \u2248 1, so we can ignore it in the denominator for approximation. So P1 = exp(-30/(gamma1 c tau)).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(gamma1 c tau)\n=> 30/(gamma1 c tau) = ln(3) \u2248 1.0986\nSo gamma1 c tau = 30 / 1.0986 \u2248 27.3 meters.\n\nWait, but gamma1 is given as 20. So gamma1 c tau = 20 * c tau = 27.3 m. So c tau = 27.3 / 20 = 1.365 meters.\n\nWait, but c is approximately 3e8 m/s, so tau would be 1.365 / (3e8) \u2248 4.55e-9 seconds. That's the proper lifetime of the particle. But I'm not sure if I need to compute tau, but perhaps I can relate the two scenarios.\n\nNow, the question is, what gamma2 is needed so that P2 = 2/3, i.e., exp(-30/(gamma2 c tau)) = 2/3.\n\nTaking natural logs:\n\n-30/(gamma2 c tau) = ln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n30/(gamma2 c tau) = 0.4055.\n\nSo, gamma2 c tau = 30 / 0.4055 \u2248 74.02.\n\nBut from the first scenario, we have gamma1 c tau = 27.3.\n\nSo gamma2 c tau = 74.02.\n\nSo gamma2 = (gamma1 c tau) * (74.02)/(27.3) ) / gamma1 c tau? Wait, no. Wait, gamma1 c tau =27.3. So gamma2 = (74.02) * (gamma1 c tau) / (27.3 * c tau) )? No, wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWe have from the first case: gamma1 c tau = 27.3.\n\nIn the second case: gamma2 c tau = 74.02.\n\nSo gamma2 = (74.02) / (27.3) ) * gamma1.\n\nWait, because gamma1 c tau is 27.3. So gamma2 c tau = 74.02 = (74.02/27.3) * gamma1 c tau.\n\nSo gamma2 = (74.02 / 27.3) * gamma1.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because gamma2 c tau is 74.02, and gamma1 c tau is 27.3, so gamma2 = (74.02 / 27.3) * gamma1.\n\nWait, gamma1 is 20. So 74.02 / 27.3 \u2248 2.71.\n\nSo gamma2 \u2248 20 * 2.71 \u2248 54.2.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, which is close. So the answer would be A) 54.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. So the initial condition gives gamma1 c tau = 27.3. The second condition requires gamma2 c tau = 74.02. So gamma2 = (74.02) / (27.3) * gamma1.\n\nWait, no, because gamma1 c tau = 27.3, so c tau = 27.3 / gamma1.\n\nThen gamma2 c tau = gamma2 * (27.3 / gamma1) ) = 74.02.\n\nSo gamma2 = (74.02 * gamma1) / 27.3.\n\nGamma1 is 20. So 74.02 * 20 = 1480.4. Divided by 27.3: 1480.4 /27.3 \u2248 54.25. So approximately 54.25, which is option A, 54.\n\nSo the needed gamma is approximately 54.\n\n\nTo determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the particle's lifetime, and the distance it travels before decaying.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Decay and Distance Relation**:  \n   The probability that a particle reaches a distance \\( L \\) before decaying is given by the exponential decay law:  \n   \\[\n   P(L) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\beta \\gamma c \\tau}\\right),\n   \\]  \n   where \\( \\beta \\approx 1 \\) for ultra-relativistic particles, \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor, \\( c \\) is the speed of light, and \\( \\tau \\) is the proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n2. **Given Conditions**:  \n   - The detector's radius is \\( L = 30 \\, \\text{m} \\).  \n   - At \\( \\gamma_1 = 20 \\), one-third of the particles (\\( P_1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\)) reach the inner walls.  \n   - We need to find \\( \\gamma_2 \\) such that two-thirds of the particles (\\( P_2 = \\frac{2}{3} \\)) reach the inner walls.\n\n3. **Relating Probabilities**:  \n   From the exponential decay law:  \n   \\[\n   P_1 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{30}{\\gamma_1 c \\tau}\\right), \\quad P_2 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{30}{\\gamma_2 c \\tau}\\right).\n   \\]  \n   Taking natural logarithms:  \n   \\[\n   \\ln(P_1) = -\\frac{30}{\\gamma_1 c \\tau}, \\quad \\ln(P_2) = -\\frac{30}{\\gamma_2 c \\tau}.\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( P_1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\) and \\( P_2 = \\frac{2}{3} \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{30}{\\gamma_1 c \\tau}, \\quad \\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{30}{\\gamma_2 c \\tau}.\n   \\]  \n   Using \\( \\ln(1/3) \\approx -1.0986 \\) and \\( \\ln(2/3) \\approx -0.4055 \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{\\gamma_1 c \\tau} = 1.0986, \\quad \\frac{30}{\\gamma_2 c \\tau} = 0.4055.\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\( \\gamma_1 c \\tau \\) and \\( \\gamma_2 c \\tau \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\gamma_1 c \\tau = \\frac{30}{1.0986} \\approx 27.3 \\, \\text{m}, \\quad \\gamma_2 c \\tau = \\frac{30}{0.4055} \\approx 74.02 \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding \\( \\gamma_2 \\)**:  \n   Since \\( \\gamma_1 c \\tau = 27.3 \\), we can relate \\( \\gamma_2 \\) and \\( \\gamma_1 \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\gamma_2 = \\frac{\\gamma_2 c \\tau}{\\gamma_1 c \\tau} \\cdot \\gamma_1.\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( \\gamma_2 c \\tau = 74.02 \\) and \\( \\gamma_1 c \\tau = 27.3 \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\gamma_2 = \\frac{74.02}{27.3} \\cdot \\gamma_1.\n   \\]  \n   Using \\( \\gamma_1 = 20 \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\gamma_2 \\approx \\frac{74.02}{27.3} \\cdot 20 \\approx 54.2.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is approximately \\( \\gamma_2 \\approx 54 \\).  \n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Right now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.\n\nThe question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead. The options are A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D) 28.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls and their decay time. Oh right, because if a particle decays before it reaches the detector's walls, it won't be detected. So the problem is about the relationship between the particle's speed, the detector's size, and the particle's lifetime as affected by relativistic effects.\n\nLet me think. The detector is spherical with a radius of 30 meters. So the distance the particles have to travel is 30 meters. The particles are moving at a certain speed, determined by their Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), right?\n\nBut wait, when particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their speed is very close to the speed of light. So maybe we can approximate v \u2248 c for these particles. That might simplify the calculations.\n\nNow, the particles are produced at the center, so they need to reach the edge. The time it takes for a particle to reach the inner wall would be t = distance / speed. Since v \u2248 c, t \u2248 R / c. Let me compute that: R is 30 meters. The speed of light is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So t = 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds. So about 0.1 microseconds.\n\nBut wait, particles don't live that long. Their lifetime is affected by their speed. Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab frame is gamma times their proper lifetime (tau). So the lab frame sees the particle's lifetime as longer by a factor of gamma.\n\nSo the proper lifetime is tau, and the lab lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nFor the particle to reach the detector wall, it must have a lifetime such that gamma * tau is at least the time it takes to travel the distance. So gamma * tau >= t.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's about whether the particle decays before reaching the detector. So if the lifetime (gamma * tau) is less than the time t, the particle decays and doesn't reach. If it's longer, the particle makes it.\n\nSo the condition is gamma * tau >= t.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that currently, with gamma ~20, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So that means that when gamma is 20, about 33% of the particles have gamma * tau >= t, and 66% decay before reaching the walls.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again. If one third reach, that implies that two-thirds decay before reaching. So when gamma is 20, only 33% make it. We need to find a gamma where 66% make it. So the condition must be that gamma increases, making gamma * tau longer, so more particles can reach.\n\nBut wait, the fraction that reach depends on how the gamma affects the lifetime. Let me model this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nt = R / v \u2248 R / c, since v \u2248 c.\n\nThe proper lifetime is tau. So the lab lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nThe probability that the particle doesn't decay (i.e., survives) is P = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma * tau)).\n\nWait, but actually, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So the probability that it reaches the detector is P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The decay probability is P_decay = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So the survival probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no. The survival probability is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed in time t. So it's exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo when t is much smaller than gamma tau, exp(-t/(gamma tau)) is approximately 1 - t/(gamma tau). But when t is comparable to gamma tau, we can't make that approximation.\n\nIn the problem, when gamma is 20, one third reach the walls. So:\n\nexp(-t/(20 tau)) = 1/3.\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-t/(20 tau) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3).\n\nSo t/(20 tau) = ln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nSo t = 20 tau * ln(3).\n\nWait, no. Let me rearrange:\n\nt = (20 tau) * ln(3).\n\nWait, no. Wait, from exp(-t/(gamma tau)) = 1/3,\n\n- t/(gamma tau) = ln(1/3) \u2192 t/(gamma tau) = ln(3) \u2192 t = gamma tau ln(3).\n\nSo, yes, t = gamma tau ln(3).\n\nBut wait, t is the time it takes to reach the wall. So t = R/(v) \u2248 R/c.\n\nSo, R/(c) = gamma tau ln(3).\n\nBut now, we need to find the gamma where the probability of reaching is 2/3.\n\nSo in that case, the survival probability is 2/3.\n\nSo exp(-t/(gamma tau)) = 2/3.\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\n- t/(gamma tau) = ln(2/3) \u2192 t/(gamma tau) = ln(3/2) \u2192 t = gamma tau ln(3/2).\n\nBut wait, in the first case, when gamma was 20, t was 20 tau ln(3).\n\nIn the second case, with gamma_new, t is gamma_new tau ln(3/2).\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Wait, wait, no. Because t is the same in both cases because the detector's radius is the same, so R is the same, so t = R/(v) is the same. But wait, no, because the velocity v is a function of gamma, since v = beta c, and beta is related to gamma.\n\nWait, no. If the particles are at a higher gamma, their speed is higher, so the time t would be less. Because t = R/(v) = R/(beta c).\n\nWait, but wait, if gamma increases, beta approaches 1. Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So as gamma increases, beta approaches 1 from below. So higher gamma means v is closer to c, so t decreases.\n\nWait, this complicates things because t is not fixed. Because when gamma increases, beta approaches 1, so t = R/(beta c) decreases.\n\nWait, so in the first scenario, with gamma=20, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) = sqrt(1 - 1/400) = sqrt(399/400) \u2248 0.99937. So beta is very close to 1, so t \u2248 R/(c) = 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 seconds.\n\nWait, but in the first case, when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So:\n\nexp(-t/(20 tau)) = 1/3.\n\nSo t/(20 tau) = ln(3) \u2192 t = 20 tau ln(3).\n\nIn the second case, we want the survival probability to be 2/3.\n\nSo exp(-t_new/(gamma_new tau)) = 2/3.\n\nBut t_new is the time it takes to reach the wall with the new gamma. Wait, but t_new is not necessarily the same as t, because gamma_new is different.\n\nWait, no, because t_new is R/(beta_new c). So beta_new is sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_new)^2).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let's try to model it step by step.\n\nLet me denote the initial case as case 1, where gamma1 = 20.\n\nCase 1:\n\nt1 = R/(beta1 c) = 30/(beta1 * 3e8) seconds.\n\nSurvival probability P1 = exp(-t1/(gamma1 tau)) = 1/3.\n\nSo equation 1: exp(-t1/(gamma1 tau)) = 1/3.\n\nCase 2: We want P2 = 2/3.\n\nt2 = R/(beta2 c) = 30/(beta2 * 3e8).\n\nP2 = exp(-t2/(gamma2 tau)) = 2/3.\n\nWe need to find gamma2.\n\nBut we have two equations here, but variables are tau, beta1, beta2, gamma2. So maybe we can relate them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express tau in terms of the initial case, and then substitute into the second case.\n\nFrom equation 1: t1 = gamma1 tau ln(3).\n\nBecause from exp(-t1/(gamma1 tau)) = 1/3 \u2192 -t1/(gamma1 tau) = ln(1/3) \u2192 t1 = gamma1 tau ln(3).\n\nBut t1 is R/(beta1 c). So,\n\nR/(beta1 c) = gamma1 tau ln(3).\n\nSo tau = R/(beta1 c gamma1 ln(3)).\n\nNow, for case 2, t2 = R/(beta2 c) = gamma2 tau ln(3/2).\n\nBecause P2 = 2/3 \u2192 exp(-t2/(gamma2 tau)) = 2/3 \u2192 -t2/(gamma2 tau) = ln(2/3) \u2192 t2/(gamma2 tau) = ln(3/2) \u2192 t2 = gamma2 tau ln(3/2).\n\nBut tau is known from case 1, so substitute:\n\nt2 = gamma2 * (R/(beta1 c gamma1 ln(3))) ) * ln(3/2).\n\nBut t2 is also R/(beta2 c).\n\nSo,\n\nR/(beta2 c) = gamma2 * R/(beta1 c gamma1 ln(3)) ) * ln(3/2).\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide both sides by R/(c):\n\n1/beta2 = gamma2 * (1/(beta1 gamma1 ln(3))) ) * ln(3/2).\n\nMultiply both sides by beta1 gamma1 ln(3):\n\nbeta1 gamma1 ln(3) / beta2 = gamma2 ln(3/2).\n\nRearranging:\n\ngamma2 = (beta1 gamma1 ln(3)) / (beta2 ln(3/2)) ).\n\nHmm, but beta1 and beta2 are related to their respective gamma values.\n\nBecause beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/ (20)^2 ) \u2248 sqrt(399/400) \u2248 0.999375.\n\nSimilarly, beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma2)^2 ).\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's see if we can express beta1 and beta2 in terms of gamma1 and gamma2.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: since the particles are ultra-relativistic, beta is approximately 1. So perhaps we can approximate beta \u22481 for both cases.\n\nIf we make that approximation, then t1 \u2248 R/c and t2 \u2248 R/c.\n\nBut wait, if beta is approximately 1 for both, then t1 = t2 = R/c.\n\nSo for case 1:\n\nexp(- (R/c)/(gamma1 tau) ) = 1/3.\n\nSo (R/c)/(gamma1 tau) ) = ln(3).\n\nSo tau = R/(c gamma1 ln(3)).\n\nIn case 2, we have:\n\nexp( - (R/c)/(gamma2 tau) ) = 2/3.\n\nSo (R/c)/(gamma2 tau) ) = ln(3/2).\n\nBut from case 1, tau = R/(c gamma1 ln(3)).\n\nSubstituting into case 2:\n\n(R/c) / (gamma2 * [ R/(c gamma1 ln(3)) ]) ) = ln(3/2).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n(R/c) * (gamma1 ln(3) ) / (gamma2 R/c) ) = ln(3/2).\n\nThe R and c terms cancel:\n\n(gamma1 ln(3)) / gamma2 = ln(3/2).\n\nSo,\n\ngamma2 = gamma1 * (ln(3) ) / (ln(3/2)).\n\nCompute the ratio:\n\nln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nSo ratio is 1.0986 / 0.4055 \u2248 2.707.\n\nSo gamma2 \u2248 gamma1 * 2.707.\n\nSince gamma1 is 20, gamma2 \u2248 20 * 2.707 \u2248 54.14.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.\n\nBut wait, this is under the approximation that beta \u22481, which might not be accurate for gamma=54, but since gamma is high, beta is very close to 1, so this approximation should be okay.\n\nWait, let's check beta for gamma=54:\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - 1/(54)^2 ) \u2248 sqrt(1 - 1/2916 ) = sqrt(2915/2916) \u2248 0.999657.\n\nSo beta is indeed very close to 1. So the approximation holds.\n\nSo the needed gamma is approximately 54.14, so the closest option is A)54.\n\nBut wait, in the initial problem, when gamma was 20, only one third reached. But with gamma=54, two-thirds reach. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my math.\n\nIn case 1:\n\ngamma1 =20.\n\nWe have P1 = 1/3 = exp( -t/(gamma1 tau) )\n\nSo -t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(1/3) \u2192 t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(3).\n\nt = gamma1 tau ln(3).\n\nIn case 2, we have P2=2/3 = exp( -t/(gamma2 tau) ).\n\nSo t/(gamma2 tau) = ln(3/2).\n\nBut if t is the same as before, that would imply gamma2 = (gamma1 ln(3) ) / ln(3/2).\n\nBut t is not the same because t depends on beta, which depends on gamma. So when gamma increases, beta approaches 1, so t decreases.\n\nWait, but earlier, I assumed beta is approximately 1 for both cases, which leads to t being approximately the same. So perhaps in reality, t is a bit shorter for gamma=54.\n\nWait, but that complicates things. Let me re-examine the equations without approximations.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me write the equations more precisely.\n\nIn case 1:\n\nt1 = R/(beta1 c)\n\nP1 = exp( -t1/(gamma1 tau) ) = 1/3.\n\nIn case 2:\n\nt2 = R/(beta2 c)\n\nP2 = exp( -t2/(gamma2 tau) ) = 2/3.\n\nWe need to find gamma2.\n\nFrom case 1, we can express tau as:\n\ntau = t1/(gamma1 ln(3)).\n\nBut t1 = R/(beta1 c).\n\nSo tau = R/( beta1 c gamma1 ln(3) ).\n\nSubstituting into case 2 equation:\n\nexp( -t2/(gamma2 tau) ) = 2/3.\n\nTake ln both sides:\n\n- t2/(gamma2 tau) = ln(2/3) \u2192 t2/(gamma2 tau) = ln(3/2).\n\nSubstituting tau from case 1:\n\nt2 = gamma2 tau ln(3/2).\n\nBut t2 = R/(beta2 c).\n\nSo,\n\nR/(beta2 c) = gamma2 * [ R/( beta1 c gamma1 ln(3) ) ] * ln(3/2).\n\nCancel R and c from both sides:\n\n1/beta2 = gamma2 * (1/(beta1 gamma1 ln(3))) * ln(3/2).\n\nRearranging:\n\ngamma2 = [ beta1 gamma1 ln(3) ] / [ beta2 ln(3/2) ].\n\nNow, beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/400) = sqrt(399/400) \u2248 0.999375.\n\nSimilarly, beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2).\n\nBut this makes the equation a bit complicated because gamma2 is on both sides.\n\nWait, perhaps we can make an approximation since gamma is large.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ngamma1 =20, gamma2 is what we're looking for.\n\nWe can write beta1 \u22481 - 1/(2 gamma1^2) (using the approximation sqrt(1 - x) \u22481 - x/2 for small x).\n\nSimilarly, beta2 \u22481 - 1/(2 gamma2^2).\n\nBut let's compute beta1 and beta2 more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assume beta1 and beta2 are approximately 1, which is valid since gamma is large (20 and higher), so beta is very close to 1.\n\nSo, with beta1 \u22481 and beta2 \u22481, the equation becomes:\n\ngamma2 \u2248 [ 1 * 20 * ln(3) ] / [1 * ln(3/2) ].\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to gamma2 \u224854.14.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)54.\n\nBut wait, let's check with more precise beta values.\n\nLet me compute beta1 for gamma=20:\n\nbeta1 = sqrt(1 - (1/20)^2 ) = sqrt(399/400) = sqrt(0.9975) \u2248 0.998746.\n\nSimilarly, for gamma=54:\n\nbeta2 = sqrt(1 - (1/54)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 1/2916) = sqrt(2915/2916) \u2248 0.999657.\n\nSo let's compute the equation with more precise beta values.\n\nEquation:\n\ngamma2 = [ beta1 * gamma1 * ln(3) ] / [ beta2 * ln(3/2) ]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nbeta1 = 0.998746, gamma1=20.\n\nbeta2 = 0.999657.\n\nln(3) \u22481.0986.\n\nln(3/2) \u22480.4055.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma2 = (0.998746 * 20 * 1.0986 ) / (0.999657 * 0.4055 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n0.998746 *20 = 19.97492.\n\n19.97492 *1.0986 \u224821.934.\n\nDenominator:\n\n0.999657 *0.4055 \u22480.4053.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma2 \u224821.934 / 0.4053 \u224854.08.\n\nSo about 54.08, which is very close to 54. So option A is correct.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the particles' survival probability, and the detector's geometry.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Right now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.\n\nThe question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead. The options are A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D) 28.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls and their decay time. Oh right, because if a particle decays before it reaches the detector's walls, it won't be detected. So the problem is about the relationship between the particle's speed, the detector's size, and the particle's lifetime as affected by relativistic effects.\n\nLet me think. The detector is spherical with a radius of 30 meters. So the distance the particles have to travel is 30 meters. The particles are moving at a certain speed, determined by their Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), right?\n\nBut wait, when particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their speed is very close to the speed of light. So maybe we can approximate v \u2248 c for these particles. That might simplify the calculations.\n\nNow, the particles are produced at the center, so they need to reach the edge. The time it takes for a particle to reach the inner wall would be t = distance / speed. Since v \u2248 c, t \u2248 R / c. Let me compute that: R is 30 meters. The speed of light is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So t = 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds. So about 0.1 microseconds.\n\nBut wait, particles don't live that long. Their lifetime is affected by their speed. Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab frame is gamma times their proper lifetime (tau). So the lab frame sees the particle's lifetime as longer by a factor of gamma.\n\nSo the proper lifetime is tau, and the lab lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nFor the particle to reach the detector wall, it must have a lifetime such that gamma * tau is at least the time it takes to travel the distance. So gamma * tau >= t.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's about whether the particle decays before reaching the detector. So if the lifetime (gamma * tau) is less than the time t, the particle decays and doesn't reach. If it's longer, the particle makes it.\n\nSo the condition is gamma * tau >= t.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that currently, with gamma ~20, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So that means that when gamma is 20, about 33% of the particles have gamma * tau >= t, and 66% decay before reaching the walls.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again. If one third reach, that implies that two-thirds decay before reaching. So when gamma is 20, only 33% make it. We need to find a gamma where 66% make it. So the condition must be that gamma increases, making gamma * tau longer, so more particles can reach.\n\nBut wait, the fraction that reach depends on how the gamma affects the lifetime. Let me model this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nt = R / v \u2248 R / c, since v \u2248 c.\n\nThe proper lifetime is tau. So the lab lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nThe probability that the particle doesn't decay (i.e., survives) is P = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma * tau)).\n\nWait, but actually, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So the probability that it reaches the detector is P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The decay probability is P_decay = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So the survival probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no. The survival probability is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed in time t. So it's exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo when t is much smaller than gamma tau, exp(-t/(gamma tau)) is approximately 1 - t/(gamma tau). But when t is comparable to gamma tau, we can't make that approximation.\n\nIn the problem, when gamma is 20, one third reach the walls. So:\n\nexp(-t/(20 tau)) = 1/3.\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-t/(20 tau) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3).\n\nSo t/(20 tau) = ln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nSo t = 20 tau * ln(3).\n\nWait, no. Let me rearrange:\n\nt = (20 tau) * ln(3).\n\nWait, no. Wait, from exp(-t/(gamma tau)) = 1/3,\n\n- t/(gamma tau) = ln(1/3) \u2192 t/(gamma tau) = ln(3) \u2192 t = gamma tau ln(3).\n\nSo, yes, t = gamma tau ln(3).\n\nBut wait, t is the time it takes to reach the wall. So t = R/(v) \u2248 R/c.\n\nSo, R/(c) = gamma tau ln(3).\n\nBut now, we need to find the gamma where the probability of reaching is 2/3.\n\nSo in that case, the survival probability is 2/3.\n\nSo exp(-t/(gamma tau)) = 2/3.\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\n- t/(gamma tau) = ln(2/3) \u2192 t/(gamma tau) = ln(3/2) \u2192 t = gamma tau ln(3/2).\n\nBut wait, in the first case, when gamma was 20, t was 20 tau ln(3).\n\nIn the second case, with gamma_new, t is gamma_new tau ln(3/2).\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Wait, wait, no. Because t is the same in both cases because the detector's radius is the same, so R is the same, so t = R/(v) is the same. But wait, no, because the velocity v is a function of gamma, since v = beta c, and beta is related to gamma.\n\nWait, no. If the particles are at a higher gamma, their speed is higher, so the time t would be less. Because t = R/(v) = R/(beta c).\n\nWait, but wait, if gamma increases, beta approaches 1. Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So as gamma increases, beta approaches 1 from below. So higher gamma means v is closer to c, so t decreases.\n\nWait, this complicates things because t is not fixed. Because when gamma increases, beta approaches 1, so t = R/(beta c) decreases.\n\nWait, so in the first scenario, with gamma=20, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) = sqrt(1 - 1/400) = sqrt(399/400) \u2248 0.99937. So beta is very close to 1, so t \u2248 R/(c) = 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 seconds.\n\nWait, but in the first case, when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So:\n\nexp(-t/(20 tau)) = 1/3.\n\nSo t/(20 tau) = ln(3) \u2192 t = 20 tau ln(3).\n\nIn the second case, we want the survival probability to be 2/3.\n\nSo exp(-t_new/(gamma_new tau)) = 2/3.\n\nBut t_new is the time it takes to reach the wall with the new gamma. Wait, but t_new is not necessarily the same as t, because gamma_new is different.\n\nWait, no, because t_new is R/(beta_new c). So beta_new is sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_new)^2).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let's try to model it step by step.\n\nLet me denote the initial case as case 1, where gamma1 = 20.\n\nCase 1:\n\nt1 = R/(beta1 c) = 30/(beta1 * 3e8) seconds.\n\nSurvival probability P1 = exp(-t1/(gamma1 tau)) = 1/3.\n\nSo equation 1: exp(-t1/(gamma1 tau)) = 1/3.\n\nCase 2: We want P2 = 2/3.\n\nt2 = R/(beta2 c) = 30/(beta2 * 3e8).\n\nP2 = exp(-t2/(gamma2 tau)) = 2/3.\n\nWe need to find gamma2.\n\nBut we have two equations here, but variables are tau, beta1, beta2, gamma2. So maybe we can relate them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express tau in terms of the initial case, and then substitute into the second case.\n\nFrom equation 1: t1 = gamma1 tau ln(3).\n\nBecause from exp(-t1/(gamma1 tau)) = 1/3 \u2192 -t1/(gamma1 tau) = ln(1/3) \u2192 t1 = gamma1 tau ln(3).\n\nBut t1 is R/(beta1 c). So,\n\nR/(beta1 c) = gamma1 tau ln(3).\n\nSo tau = R/(beta1 c gamma1 ln(3)).\n\nNow, for case 2, t2 = R/(beta2 c) = gamma2 tau ln(3/2).\n\nBecause P2 = 2/3 \u2192 exp(-t2/(gamma2 tau)) = 2/3 \u2192 -t2/(gamma2 tau) = ln(2/3) \u2192 t2/(gamma2 tau) = ln(3/2) \u2192 t2 = gamma2 tau ln(3/2).\n\nBut tau is known from case 1, so substitute:\n\nt2 = gamma2 * (R/(beta1 c gamma1 ln(3))) ) * ln(3/2).\n\nBut t2 is also R/(beta2 c).\n\nSo,\n\nR/(beta2 c) = gamma2 * R/(beta1 c gamma1 ln(3)) ) * ln(3/2).\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide both sides by R/(c):\n\n1/beta2 = gamma2 * (1/(beta1 gamma1 ln(3))) ) * ln(3/2).\n\nMultiply both sides by beta1 gamma1 ln(3):\n\nbeta1 gamma1 ln(3) / beta2 = gamma2 ln(3/2).\n\nRearranging:\n\ngamma2 = (beta1 gamma1 ln(3)) / (beta2 ln(3/2)) ).\n\nHmm, but beta1 and beta2 are related to their respective gamma values.\n\nBecause beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/ (20)^2 ) \u2248 sqrt(399/400) \u2248 0.999375.\n\nSimilarly, beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma2)^2 ).\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's see if we can express beta1 and beta2 in terms of gamma1 and gamma2.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: since the particles are ultra-relativistic, beta is approximately 1. So perhaps we can approximate beta \u22481 for both cases.\n\nIf we make that approximation, then t1 \u2248 R/c and t2 \u2248 R/c.\n\nBut wait, if beta is approximately 1 for both, then t1 = t2 = R/c.\n\nSo for case 1:\n\nexp(- (R/c)/(gamma1 tau) ) = 1/3.\n\nSo (R/c)/(gamma1 tau) ) = ln(3).\n\nSo tau = R/(c gamma1 ln(3)).\n\nIn case 2, we have:\n\nexp( - (R/c)/(gamma2 tau) ) = 2/3.\n\nSo (R/c)/(gamma2 tau) ) = ln(3/2).\n\nBut from case 1, tau = R/(c gamma1 ln(3)).\n\nSubstituting into case 2:\n\n(R/c) / (gamma2 * [ R/(c gamma1 ln(3)) ]) ) = ln(3/2).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n(R/c) * (gamma1 ln(3) ) / (gamma2 R/c) ) = ln(3/2).\n\nThe R and c terms cancel:\n\n(gamma1 ln(3)) / gamma2 = ln(3/2).\n\nSo,\n\ngamma2 = gamma1 * (ln(3) ) / (ln(3/2)).\n\nCompute the ratio:\n\nln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nSo ratio is 1.0986 / 0.4055 \u2248 2.707.\n\nSo gamma2 \u2248 gamma1 * 2.707.\n\nSince gamma1 is 20, gamma2 \u2248 20 * 2.707 \u2248 54.14.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.\n\nBut wait, this is under the approximation that beta \u22481, which might not be accurate for gamma=54, but since gamma is high, beta is very close to 1, so this approximation should be okay.\n\nWait, let's check beta for gamma=54:\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - 1/(54)^2 ) \u2248 sqrt(1 - 1/2916 ) = sqrt(2915/2916) \u2248 0.999657.\n\nSo beta is indeed very close to 1. So the approximation holds.\n\nSo the needed gamma is approximately 54.14, so the closest option is A)54.\n\nBut wait, in the initial problem, when gamma was 20, only one third reached. But with gamma=54, two-thirds reach. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my math.\n\nIn case 1:\n\ngamma1 =20.\n\nWe have P1 = 1/3 = exp( -t/(gamma1 tau) )\n\nSo -t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(1/3) \u2192 t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(3).\n\nt = gamma1 tau ln(3).\n\nIn case 2, we have P2=2/3 = exp( -t/(gamma2 tau) ).\n\nSo t/(gamma2 tau) = ln(3/2).\n\nBut if t is the same as before, that would imply gamma2 = (gamma1 ln(3) ) / ln(3/2).\n\nBut t is not the same because t depends on beta, which depends on gamma. So when gamma increases, beta approaches 1, so t decreases.\n\nWait, but earlier, I assumed beta is approximately 1 for both cases, which leads to t being approximately the same. So perhaps in reality, t is a bit shorter for gamma=54.\n\nWait, but that complicates things. Let me re-examine the equations without approximations.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me write the equations more precisely.\n\nIn case 1:\n\nt1 = R/(beta1 c)\n\nP1 = exp( -t1/(gamma1 tau) ) = 1/3.\n\nIn case 2:\n\nt2 = R/(beta2 c)\n\nP2 = exp( -t2/(gamma2 tau) ) = 2/3.\n\nWe need to find gamma2.\n\nFrom case 1, we can express tau as:\n\ntau = t1/(gamma1 ln(3)).\n\nBut t1 = R/(beta1 c).\n\nSo tau = R/( beta1 c gamma1 ln(3) ).\n\nSubstituting into case 2 equation:\n\nexp( -t2/(gamma2 tau) ) = 2/3.\n\nTake ln both sides:\n\n- t2/(gamma2 tau) = ln(2/3) \u2192 t2/(gamma2 tau) = ln(3/2).\n\nSubstituting tau from case 1:\n\nt2 = gamma2 tau ln(3/2).\n\nBut t2 = R/(beta2 c).\n\nSo,\n\nR/(beta2 c) = gamma2 * [ R/( beta1 c gamma1 ln(3) ) ] * ln(3/2).\n\nCancel R and c from both sides:\n\n1/beta2 = gamma2 * (1/(beta1 gamma1 ln(3))) * ln(3/2).\n\nRearranging:\n\ngamma2 = [ beta1 gamma1 ln(3) ] / [ beta2 ln(3/2) ].\n\nNow, beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/400) = sqrt(399/400) \u2248 0.999375.\n\nSimilarly, beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2).\n\nBut this makes the equation a bit complicated because gamma2 is on both sides.\n\nWait, perhaps we can make an approximation since gamma is large.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ngamma1 =20, gamma2 is what we're looking for.\n\nWe can write beta1 \u22481 - 1/(2 gamma1^2) (using the approximation sqrt(1 - x) \u22481 - x/2 for small x).\n\nSimilarly, beta2 \u22481 - 1/(2 gamma2^2).\n\nBut let's compute beta1 and beta2 more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assume beta1 and beta2 are approximately 1, which is valid since gamma is large (20 and higher), so beta is very close to 1.\n\nSo, with beta1 \u22481 and beta2 \u22481, the equation becomes:\n\ngamma2 \u2248 [ 1 * 20 * ln(3) ] / [1 * ln(3/2) ].\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to gamma2 \u224854.14.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)54.\n\nBut wait, let's check with more precise beta values.\n\nLet me compute beta1 for gamma=20:\n\nbeta1 = sqrt(1 - (1/20)^2 ) = sqrt(399/400) = sqrt(0.9975) \u2248 0.998746.\n\nSimilarly, for gamma=54:\n\nbeta2 = sqrt(1 - (1/54)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 1/2916) = sqrt(2915/2916) \u2248 0.999657.\n\nSo let's compute the equation with more precise beta values.\n\nEquation:\n\ngamma2 = [ beta1 * gamma1 * ln(3) ] / [ beta2 * ln(3/2) ]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nbeta1 = 0.998746, gamma1=20.\n\nbeta2 = 0.999657.\n\nln(3) \u22481.0986.\n\nln(3/2) \u22480.4055.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma2 = (0.998746 * 20 * 1.0986 ) / (0.999657 * 0.4055 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n0.998746 *20 = 19.97492.\n\n19.97492 *1.0986 \u224821.934.\n\nDenominator:\n\n0.999657 *0.4055 \u22480.4053.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma2 \u224821.934 / 0.4053 \u224854.08.\n\nSo about 54.08, which is very close to 54. So option A is correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the particles' survival probability, and the detector's geometry. The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds. The survival probability of a particle reaching the detector's inner walls depends on its lifetime, which is time-dilated by the Lorentz factor, and the time it takes to travel the detector's radius.\n\n### Key Equations and Analysis\n\n1. **Time to Reach the Detector Walls**:  \n   The time it takes for a particle to reach the inner walls is approximately:  \n   \\[\n   t \\approx \\frac{R}{\\beta c}\n   \\]  \n   where \\( R = 30 \\, \\text{m} \\), \\( \\beta = v/c \\), and \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\n2. **Survival Probability**:  \n   The survival probability of a particle reaching the detector walls is given by:  \n   \\[\n   P = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\gamma \\tau}\\right)\n   \\]  \n   where \\( \\tau \\) is the proper lifetime of the particle, and \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3. **Relating Lorentz Factor and Survival Probability**:  \n   For the initial case (\\( \\gamma_1 = 20 \\)), one-third of the particles reach the walls, so:  \n   \\[\n   P_1 = \\frac{1}{3} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_1}{\\gamma_1 \\tau}\\right)\n   \\]  \n   Taking the natural logarithm:  \n   \\[\n   -\\frac{t_1}{\\gamma_1 \\tau} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\implies \\frac{t_1}{\\gamma_1 \\tau} = \\ln(3)\n   \\]  \n   Thus:  \n   \\[\n   t_1 = \\gamma_1 \\tau \\ln(3)\n   \\]  \n\n   For the second case (\\( \\gamma_2 \\)), two-thirds of the particles reach the walls, so:  \n   \\[\n   P_2 = \\frac{2}{3} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_2}{\\gamma_2 \\tau}\\right)\n   \\]  \n   Taking the natural logarithm:  \n   \\[\n   -\\frac{t_2}{\\gamma_2 \\tau} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\implies \\frac{t_2}{\\gamma_2 \\tau} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n   \\]  \n   Thus:  \n   \\[\n   t_2 = \\gamma_2 \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n   \\]  \n\n4. **Relating \\( t_1 \\) and \\( t_2 \\)**:  \n   Since \\( t = \\frac{R}{\\beta c} \\), and \\( \\beta \\approx 1 \\) for ultra-relativistic particles, \\( t_1 \\approx t_2 \\). Substituting \\( \\tau \\) from the first case into the second case:  \n   \\[\n   t_2 = \\gamma_2 \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n   \\]  \n   From \\( t_1 = \\gamma_1 \\tau \\ln(3) \\), we find:  \n   \\[\n   \\tau = \\frac{t_1}{\\gamma_1 \\ln(3)}\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( \\tau \\) into the second case:  \n   \\[\n   t_2 = \\gamma_2 \\left(\\frac{t_1}{\\gamma_1 \\ln(3)}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n   \\]  \n   Since \\( t_1 \\approx t_2 \\), we equate and solve for \\( \\gamma_2 \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\gamma_2 = \\gamma_1 \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)}\n   \\]  \n\n5. **Numerical Calculation**:  \n   Using \\( \\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986 \\) and \\( \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\approx 0.4055 \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\gamma_2 = 20 \\cdot \\frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \\approx 20 \\cdot 2.707 \\approx 54.14\n   \\]  \n\n### Conclusion\nThe required Lorentz factor to ensure that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls is approximately **54**. This corresponds to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
