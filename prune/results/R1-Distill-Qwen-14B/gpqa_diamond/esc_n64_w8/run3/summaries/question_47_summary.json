      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see what I can figure out here.\n\nFirst, let me look at the IR data. The strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are probably due to N-H stretching. Wait, but those could also be from O-H, like in a carboxylic acid. But the 1720 cm-1 band is a strong peak, which I remember is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe it's an amide or an ester or something like that.\n\nLooking at the options, all of them have either an amide, ester, or formamide group. So the carbonyl is definitely present. The IR also shows N-H or O-H, but I'm not sure yet which one.\n\nNext, the 1H NMR data. Let me go through it piece by piece.\n\n- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: That's a typical ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to something else, maybe an oxygen. Because in ethyl esters, the CH3 is usually around 1.2-1.4 ppm as a triplet.\n\n- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H: Broad singlet suggests maybe an amine (NH2) or something exchanging, but with 2H. Wait, but in the options, I see '4-aminophenyl propionate' and 'ethyl 4-aminobenzoate'. Amines can show up as broad signals, but sometimes if the solution is in D2O, they might not show. Hmm. Alternatively, this could be an OCH2CH3 group, but that's usually a quartet around 4.1 ppm. Wait, 4.0 is close. Maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something else.\n\n- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H: Quartet and 2H. That makes me think of a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an OCH2CH3. Wait, but the quartet suggests splitting from adjacent CH2. Oh, perhaps it's part of an ester group. Like OCH2CH3 would be a quartet, but wait, the triplet at 1.2 would be the CH3. So maybe the 4.5 is a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2 connected to another group. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent group, like in an amide.\n\nWait, let me think. The quartet at 4.5 ppm with 2H could be part of an ethyl group attached to an electronegative atom. So for example, in an ester like ethyl something, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 as a quartet around 4.1-4.3, but here it's at 4.5. Hmm, maybe it's a different group.\n\nLooking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. Two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests a para-substituted aromatic structure. So the substituent is in the para position.\n\nNow, let's consider the options.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group on the 3-position. The benzamide has a CONH2 group. So IR would show the amide N-H stretches. Wait, but the IR here has two bands around 3400, which could be two N-H groups. But wait, in benzamide, there are two NHs. Also, the carbonyl would be around 1680 or so. Wait, but the given IR is at 1720, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's an ester carbonyl, which is higher. So maybe benzamide is less likely.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide is HCONH2, but attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So structure would be Ph-OCH2CH3 attached to HCONH2. Wait, but formamide has a carbonyl adjacent to NH2. The IR would show the amide N-H. The formamide's carbonyl would be around 1700, maybe higher. The ethoxy group would have its own signals. Let's think about the NMR.\n\nIn formamide, the NH2 would be broad, but maybe in the NMR, it's not showing up because of exchange. Alternatively, the ethoxy group would be at around 1.2 (CH3) and 4.0 (OCH2CH3). But wait, the NMR here has 4.0 as a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit with OCH2CH3. Because OCH2CH3 is usually a quartet around 4.1, with the CH3 as triplet at 1.2. So maybe that's not it.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be PhNH2 attached to a propionate (CH2CH2COO-). Wait, no. Propionate is CH2CH2COOH, but in this case, it's an ester, maybe. Wait, the structure would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? Hmm, I'm not sure. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let's think about the NMR.\n\nThe propionate ester would have an ethyl group, but the OCH2CH3 would be around 4.1 as quartet, but in the NMR data, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm. Also, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet, perhaps the NH2 group? But amines can show up as broad signals, but if the solution is in DMSO, sometimes they might be sharp. But in any case, the aromatic protons would be at 7.0 and 8.0, which aligns with a para-substituted ring, maybe with an amino group.\n\nWait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degrees of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or double bond. So for C9H11NO2: 2n+2 = 2(9)+2=20. 11 is less than 20, so the difference is 9. So 9 degrees. But wait, that can't be right. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me compute:\n\nDegrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X=0, N=1.\n\nSo (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 =10/2=5. So 5 degrees. So five rings or double bonds. Benzene ring is 3 (one ring and three double bonds), so remaining 2. So maybe an amide (double bond from C=O) and an ethoxy group (which is a single bond, but no degrees of unsaturation). Or maybe an ester carbonyl (another double bond), and the rest.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure would be PhNH2COOCH2CH3. Let's check the molecular formula: benzoate is C7H5O2, but wait, 4-aminobenzoate would be C7H6N O2. Then ethyl ester would add C2H5, so total is C9H11NO2. Yep, that matches.\n\nNow, the NMR for D: the ethyl ester group would have the CH3 as triplet at 1.2 (which matches the 1.20 ppm triplet). The OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 as quartet around 4.1-4.3, but in the data it's at 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the splitting is more downfield because of the adjacent carbonyl.\n\nWait, maybe the OCH2 is deshielded, so the quartet is at 4.5. Also, the 4.0 ppm as broad singlet is 2H. Wait, in ethyl ester, the OCH2 is split into quartet. But in this case, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. That doesn't fit with OCH2. So maybe that's something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: if it's an amide. Let's think about option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is OCH2CH3 attached to benzene at position 3, and a CONH2 group at position 1? Wait, benzamide is PhCONH2. So 3-ethoxy would be OCH2CH3 on carbon 3.\n\nIn the NMR, the ethoxy group would have the CH3 as triplet at 1.2 and OCH2 as quartet at around 4.0-4.1. But the NMR data shows a quartet at 4.5, which is a bit upfield. Hmm, maybe that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 with formamide (HCONH2) attached. So the formamide group would have a CONH2. The NH2 would give broad peaks, but maybe not visible in the NMR if exchanged. The OCH2CH3 would be at 4.0 (quartet) and 1.2 (triplet). But in the NMR data, 4.5 is a quartet (q), so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the NMR data:\n\n1H NMR:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): Ethyl CH3.\n\n- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Maybe an NH group? Or perhaps a methylene next to something else.\n\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet for 2H. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Like an OCH2 group in an ester.\n\n- Aromatic: 7.0 (d, 2H), 8.0 (d, 2H): para substitution.\n\nSo, putting this together, the aromatic protons are para, so substituents are in positions 4 and maybe 1.\n\nLooking at the options, D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is:\n\nO\n||\nO-C-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, which has an amino group in the para position.\n\nWait, no. 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group in the para position relative to the ester group. So the structure is:\n\nBenzoate ester: O=C(O-)OCH2CH3, but attached to the benzene ring in position 4, with an amino group in position 1. Wait, no. 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group in position 4, same as the ester? No, because benzoate is COO-. So ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be:\n\nBenzoate ester: benzene ring with COOEt (ethyl ester) in position 4, and an amino group in position 1 (para to the ester group). So the structure is:\n\nPh\u2013NH2\u2013COOEt.\n\nWait, but wait, the amino group is in position 4 relative to the COOEt. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. So the ring would have the amino and the ester group opposite each other.\n\nIn that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which is what the NMR shows.\n\nSo the aromatic region supports this structure.\n\nNow, looking at the NMR of the substituents:\n\nThe ethyl ester would give triplet at 1.20 (CH3), and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3, but in the data, it's at 4.5. That's a bit higher than expected, but maybe it's due to deshielding from the adjacent carbonyl. So 4.5 as quartet for 2H.\n\nWhat about the 4.0 ppm, broad singlet for 2H? In this structure, the amino group is NH2. If the sample is in DMSO-d6, the NH2 protons might show up as a broad peak. But in the NMR, it's a singlet, so perhaps it's not the NH2. Alternatively, maybe it's another group.\n\nWait, another possibility: the NH2 might not be showing up because of exchange broadening, so in the NMR, it's not visible. So the 4.0 ppm could be something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group in another part of the molecule.\n\nWait, looking at option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the groups are:\n\n- OCH2CH3 (ester) at position 4.\n\n- NH2 at position 1.\n\nSo in the NMR, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3, but here it's at 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the amino group is causing some deshielding. Or maybe I'm miscalculating the shifts.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the NMR for option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is:\n\nPh-OCH2CH3 at position 4, and HCONH2 attached to the benzene ring. So the formamide group would have the HCONH2. The NH2 would be a broad peak, but perhaps in the NMR, it's not visible. The OCH2CH3 would be triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.0. So the NMR data has 4.0 as a broad singlet, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the quartet in the NMR is at 4.5, which is more upfield than expected for an OCH2CH3 group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 connected to something else.\n\nWait, another approach: looking at the molecular formula, the compound has 9 carbons. Let's count for each option.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nBenzoate is C7H5O2 (but in the ester form, it's C7H5NO2? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2.\n\nBenzoate ester: the benzoate is C7H5O2, and the ethyl ester adds C2H5. So total is C9H10O3? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When esterified with ethanol, the formula becomes C9H10O2 (since the ester replaces the -OH of the acid with OCH2CH3, so C7H5O2 (benzoate) + C2H5O (ethyl group) would be C9H10O2? Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R', so the formula would be C7H5O2 (benzoate) plus C2H5O (ethyl) \u2192 C9H10O3? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nBenzoic acid is C7H6O2. When it becomes ethyl benzoate, it's C7H5O2 (from COO-) plus C2H5O (from OCH2CH3). Wait, the formula is C9H10O2. Because benzoic acid is C7H6O2, when you esterify with ethanol (C2H5OH), you lose a water, so the ester is C7H5O2 (from COO-) + C2H5 (from OCH2CH3) \u2192 C9H10O2.\n\nBut in option D, it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the benzoate is C7H5NO2. Because the amino group adds one N and subtracts one H (since it's replacing a H from the COO- group). So the formula would be C7H5NO2 (the amine part) plus C2H5 (ethyl) \u2192 C9H7NO2. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's compute the formula for each option.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nBenzoate is C7H5O2. Adding an amino group (NH2) would replace a hydrogen in the benzene ring. So the formula becomes C7H6N O2. Then esterifying with ethanol: replace the -OH of benzoic acid with OCH2CH3. So the formula is C7H5O2 (from benzoate) + C2H5O (from ethyl) \u2192 C9H10O2. But wait, the amino group adds an N and one more H. So the formula is C9H11NO2. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo the structure is correct in terms of formula.\n\nNow, back to the NMR.\n\nThe OCH2CH3 would be a quartet at ~4.1-4.3 ppm, but in the data, it's at 4.5 as quartet. Maybe the proximity to the amino group is causing a downfield shift.\n\nThe 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) might be the NH2 protons. But in DMSO, the NH2 would be a broad singlet, but with 2H. Wait, but the integration is 2H. So perhaps it's the NH2 group.\n\nWait, in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If that's the NH2, then it makes sense. The NH2 would appear as a broad peak, but sometimes in DMSO, it's a singlet. However, in some cases, NH2 protons can be exchanged and appear as broad singlets. So this could fit.\n\nThe quartet at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) would then be the OCH2 from the ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.20 is the CH3 of ethyl.\n\nThe aromatic protons are two doublets, which fit a para substitution. So in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the ester is at position 4 and the amino at position 1. The aromatic protons would be the ortho and para positions relative to the substituents, which would give two doublets.\n\nPutting this all together, the NMR data fits option D. The IR shows the carbonyl (ester or amide), and the N-H stretches could be from the amino group.\n\nWait, but the IR's carbonyl is at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for an ester (higher than amide). So that would fit with an ester group, which is present in option D.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.

Let me go through it piece by piece.\n\n- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: That's a typical ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to something else, maybe an oxygen. Because in ethyl esters, the CH3 is usually around 1.2-1.4 ppm as a triplet.\n\n- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H: Broad singlet suggests maybe an amine (NH2) or something exchanging, but with 2H. Wait, but in the options, I see '4-aminophenyl propionate' and 'ethyl 4-aminobenzoate'. Amines can show up as broad signals, but sometimes if the solution is in D2O, they might not show. Hmm. Alternatively, this could be an OCH2CH3 group, but that's usually a quartet around 4.1 ppm. Wait, 4.0 is close. Maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something else.\n\n- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H: Quartet and 2H. That makes me think of a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an OCH2CH3. Wait, but the quartet suggests splitting from adjacent CH2. Oh, perhaps it's part of an ester group. Like OCH2CH3 would be a quartet, but wait, the triplet at 1.2 would be the CH3. So maybe the 4.5 is a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2 connected to another group. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent group, like in an amide.\n\nWait, let me think. The quartet at 4.5 ppm with 2H could be part of an ethyl group attached to an electronegative atom. So for example, in an ester like ethyl something, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 as a quartet around 4.1-4.3, but here it's at 4.5. Hmm, maybe it's a different group.\n\nLooking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. Two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests a para-substituted aromatic structure. So the substituent is in the para position.\n\nNow, let's consider the options.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group on the 3-position. The benzamide has a CONH2 group. So IR would show the amide N-H stretches. Wait, but the IR here has two bands around 3400, which could be two N-H groups. But wait, in benzamide, there are two NHs. Also, the carbonyl would be around 1680 or so. Wait, but the given IR is at 1720, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's an ester carbonyl, which is higher. So maybe benzamide is less likely.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide is HCONH2, but attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So structure would be Ph-OCH2CH3 attached to HCONH2. Wait, but formamide has a carbonyl adjacent to NH2. The IR would show the amide N-H. The formamide's carbonyl would be around 1700, maybe higher. The ethoxy group would have its own signals. Let's think about the NMR.\n\nIn formamide, the NH2 would be broad, but maybe in the NMR, it's not showing up because of exchange. Alternatively, the ethoxy group would be at around 1.2 (CH3) and 4.0 (OCH2CH3). But wait, the NMR here has 4.0 as a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit with OCH2CH3. Because OCH2CH3 is usually a quartet around 4.1, with the CH3 as triplet at 1.2. So maybe that's not it.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be PhNH2 attached to a propionate (CH2CH2COO-). Wait, no. Propionate is CH2CH2COOH, but in this case, it's an ester, maybe. Wait, the structure would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? Hmm, I'm not sure. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let's think about the NMR.\n\nThe propionate ester would have an ethyl group, but the OCH2CH3 would be around 4.1 as quartet, but in the NMR data, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm. Also, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet, perhaps the NH2 group? But amines can show up as broad signals, but if the solution is in DMSO, sometimes they might be sharp. But in any case, the aromatic protons would be at 7.0 and 8.0, which aligns with a para-substituted ring, maybe with an amino group.\n\nWait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degrees of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or double bond. So for C9H11NO2: 2n+2 = 2(9)+2=20. 11 is less than 20, so the difference is 9. So 9 degrees. But wait, that can't be right. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me compute:\n\nDegrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X=0, N=1.\n\nSo (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 =10/2=5. So 5 degrees. So five rings or double bonds. Benzene ring is 3 (one ring and three double bonds), so remaining 2. So maybe an amide (double bond from C=O) and an ethoxy group (which is a single bond, but no degrees of unsaturation). Or maybe an ester carbonyl (another double bond), and the rest.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure would be PhNH2COOCH2CH3. Let's check the molecular formula: benzoate is C7H5O2, but wait, 4-aminobenzoate would be C7H6N O2. Then ethyl ester would add C2H5, so total is C9H11NO2. Yep, that matches.\n\nNow, the NMR for D: the ethyl ester group would have the CH3 as triplet at 1.2 (which matches the 1.20 ppm triplet). The OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 as quartet around 4.1-4.3, but in the data it's at 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the splitting is more downfield because of the adjacent carbonyl.\n\nWait, maybe the OCH2 is deshielded, so the quartet is at 4.5. Also, the 4.0 ppm as broad singlet is 2H. Wait, in ethyl ester, the OCH2 is split into quartet. But in this case, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. That doesn't fit with OCH2. So maybe that's something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: if it's an amide. Let's think about option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is OCH2CH3 attached to benzene at position 3, and a CONH2 group at position 1? Wait, benzamide is PhCONH2. So 3-ethoxy would be OCH2CH3 on carbon 3.\n\nIn the NMR, the ethoxy group would have the CH3 as triplet at 1.2 and OCH2 as quartet at around 4.0-4.1. But the NMR data shows a quartet at 4.5, which is a bit upfield. Hmm, maybe that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 with formamide (HCONH2) attached. So the formamide group would have a CONH2. The NH2 would give broad peaks, but maybe not visible in the NMR if exchanged. The OCH2CH3 would be at 4.0 (quartet) and 1.2 (triplet). But in the NMR data, 4.5 is a quartet (q), so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the NMR data:\n\n1H NMR:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): Ethyl CH3.\n\n- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Maybe an NH group? Or perhaps a methylene next to something else.\n\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet for 2H. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Like an OCH2 group in an ester.\n\n- Aromatic: 7.0 (d, 2H), 8.0 (d, 2H): para substitution.\n\nSo, putting this together, the aromatic protons are para, so substituents are in positions 4 and maybe 1.\n\nLooking at the options, D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is:\n\nO\n||\nO-C-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, which has an amino group in the para position.\n\nWait, no. 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group in the para position relative to the ester group. So the structure is:\n\nBenzoate ester: O=C(O-)OCH2CH3, but attached to the benzene ring in position 4, with an amino group in position 1. Wait, no. 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group in position 4, same as the ester? No, because benzoate is COO-. So ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be:\n\nBenzoate ester: benzene ring with COOEt (ethyl ester) in position 4, and an amino group in position 1 (para to the ester group). So the structure is:\n\nPh\u2013NH2\u2013COOEt.\n\nWait, but wait, the amino group is in position 4 relative to the COOEt. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. So the ring would have the amino and the ester group opposite each other.\n\nIn that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which is what the NMR shows.\n\nSo the aromatic region supports this structure.\n\nNow, looking at the NMR of the substituents:\n\nThe ethyl ester would give triplet at 1.20 (CH3), and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3, but in the data, it's at 4.5. That's a bit higher than expected, but maybe it's due to deshielding from the adjacent carbonyl. So 4.5 as quartet for 2H.\n\nWhat about the 4.0 ppm, broad singlet for 2H? In this structure, the amino group is NH2. If the sample is in DMSO-d6, the NH2 protons might show up as a broad peak. But in the NMR, it's a singlet, so perhaps it's not the NH2. Alternatively, maybe it's another group.\n\nWait, another possibility: the NH2 might not be showing up because of exchange broadening, so in the NMR, it's not visible. So the 4.0 ppm could be something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group in another part of the molecule.\n\nWait, looking at option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the groups are:\n\n- OCH2CH3 (ester) at position 4.\n\n- NH2 at position 1.\n\nSo in the NMR, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3, but here it's at 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the amino group is causing some deshielding. Or maybe I'm miscalculating the shifts.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the NMR for option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is:\n\nPh-OCH2CH3 at position 4, and HCONH2 attached to the benzene ring. So the formamide group would have the HCONH2. The NH2 would be a broad peak, but perhaps in the NMR, it's not visible. The OCH2CH3 would be triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.0. So the NMR data has 4.0 as a broad singlet, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the quartet in the NMR is at 4.5, which is more upfield than expected for an OCH2CH3 group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 connected to something else.\n\nWait, another approach: looking at the molecular formula, the compound has 9 carbons. Let's count for each option.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nBenzoate is C7H5O2 (but in the ester form, it's C7H5NO2? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2.\n\nBenzoate ester: the benzoate is C7H5O2, and the ethyl ester adds C2H5. So total is C9H10O3? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When esterified with ethanol, the formula becomes C9H10O2 (since the ester replaces the -OH of the acid with OCH2CH3, so C7H5O2 (benzoate) + C2H5O (ethyl group) would be C9H10O2? Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R', so the formula would be C7H5O2 (benzoate) plus C2H5O (ethyl) \u2192 C9H10O3? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nBenzoic acid is C7H6O2. When it becomes ethyl benzoate, it's C7H5O2 (from COO-) plus C2H5O (from OCH2CH3). Wait, the formula is C9H10O2. Because benzoic acid is C7H6O2, when you esterify with ethanol (C2H5OH), you lose a water, so the ester is C7H5O2 (from COO-) + C2H5 (from OCH2CH3) \u2192 C9H10O2.\n\nBut in option D, it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the benzoate is C7H5NO2. Because the amino group adds one N and subtracts one H (since it's replacing a H from the COO- group). So the formula would be C7H5NO2 (the amine part) plus C2H5 (ethyl) \u2192 C9H7NO2. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's compute the formula for each option.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nBenzoate is C7H5O2. Adding an amino group (NH2) would replace a hydrogen in the benzene ring. So the formula becomes C7H6N O2. Then esterifying with ethanol: replace the -OH of benzoic acid with OCH2CH3. So the formula is C7H5O2 (from benzoate) + C2H5O (from ethyl) \u2192 C9H10O2. But wait, the amino group adds an N and one more H. So the formula is C9H11NO2. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo the structure is correct in terms of formula.\n\nNow, back to the NMR.\n\nThe OCH2CH3 would be a quartet at ~4.1-4.3 ppm, but in the data, it's at 4.5 as quartet. Maybe the proximity to the amino group is causing a downfield shift.\n\nThe 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) might be the NH2 protons. But in DMSO, the NH2 would be a broad singlet, but with 2H. Wait, but the integration is 2H. So perhaps it's the NH2 group.\n\nWait, in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If that's the NH2, then it makes sense. The NH2 would appear as a broad peak, but sometimes in DMSO, it's a singlet. However, in some cases, NH2 protons can be exchanged and appear as broad singlets. So this could fit.\n\nThe quartet at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) would then be the OCH2 from the ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.20 is the CH3 of ethyl.\n\nThe aromatic protons are two doublets, which fit a para substitution. So in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the ester is at position 4 and the amino at position 1. The aromatic protons would be the ortho and para positions relative to the substituents, which would give two doublets.\n\nPutting this all together, the NMR data fits option D. The IR shows the carbonyl (ester or amide), and the N-H stretches could be from the amino group.\n\nWait, but the IR's carbonyl is at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for an ester (higher than amide). So that would fit with an ester group, which is present in option D.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n\nThe compound to be identified is C9H11NO2, and the analysis is based on the provided IR and 1H NMR data.\n\n### IR Analysis:\n- **3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9**: These bands suggest the presence of N-H stretching, likely from an amine group.\n- **1720 cm\u207b\u00b9**: This strong band indicates a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis:\n1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a CH3 group in an ethyl group (CH2CH3).\n2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, likely from an NH2 group.\n3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, characteristic of a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, likely part of an ethyl ester group.\n4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets each integrating to 2H, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n### Molecular Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation:\n- The molecular formula C9H11NO2 corresponds to **5 degrees of unsaturation**, consistent with a benzene ring (3 degrees), a carbonyl group (1 degree), and an additional double bond or ring.\n\n### Option Analysis:\n1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  \n   - Contains a benzamide group (CONH2) and an ethoxy group.  \n   - The IR would show amide N-H stretches, but the carbonyl stretch for an amide is typically lower (~1680 cm\u207b\u00b9), not 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9.  \n   - The NMR does not fit, as the aromatic protons would not align with the observed splitting pattern.  \n   - **Eliminated.**\n\n2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  \n   - Contains a formamide group (HCONH2) and an ethoxy group.  \n   - The IR would show formamide N-H stretches, but the carbonyl stretch for a formamide is typically ~1700 cm\u207b\u00b9, not 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9.  \n   - The NMR does not fit, as the ethoxy group would produce a quartet at ~4.1 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.  \n   - **Eliminated.**\n\n3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  \n   - Contains an amino group and a propionate ester.  \n   - The NMR does not fit, as the propionate ester would produce a triplet for the CH3 group and a quartet for the CH2 group, but the observed quartet is at 4.5 ppm, inconsistent with a propionate ester.  \n   - **Eliminated.**\n\n4. **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  \n   - Contains a para-aminophenyl group and an ethyl ester.  \n   - The IR matches, as the carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is consistent with an ester.  \n   - The NMR matches:  \n     - The triplet at 1.20 ppm corresponds to the CH3 group of the ethyl ester.  \n     - The quartet at 4.5 ppm corresponds to the CH2 group of the ethyl ester.  \n     - The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the NH2 group.  \n     - The aromatic protons at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) align with a para-substituted benzene ring.  \n   - The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is satisfied.  \n   - **Correct.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound C9H11NO2 is based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So, (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. Let's compute that: 20-11=9, plus 1 is 10. 10 divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a combination of rings and double bonds. For example, a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees) plus an amide group (which has a double bond and a ring? Wait, no. An amide has a carbonyl (1 double bond) and maybe another ring. Hmm, maybe a benzene ring (3) plus an ester or amide group (each has a carbonyl, so 1 each). So 3 + 1 + 1 (maybe a double bond elsewhere or another ring?), but wait, let me think. Alternatively, perhaps a benzene ring (3) and an amide group (which has a carbonyl and an amine, but the amine is saturated). So maybe the amide contributes one double bond. So that's 3+1=4. Then another double bond, or a ring? Maybe another ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the compound could have a benzene ring, an ester group (like an ethyl ester), which would add another double bond (from the carbonyl). So that gives 3+1=4. Then another double bond, maybe from an amide? Wait, but amide is a carbonyl, so that's another. Wait, maybe the structure is a benzamide with some substituents.\n\nLooking at the IR data: strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H stretches. Wait, but wait, those could also be O-H stretches, but O-H typically shows a broad peak around 3200-3600. But the given peaks are medium to strong. For N-H, like in amines or amides, which would have peaks around 3300-3500. The presence of two peaks suggests two different N-H environments? Or maybe they are from different groups. Hmm. Alternatively, if it's an amine, the N-H would show a peak around there. But let's also check the other IR data: a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak. Which functional groups have that? Esters, amides, ketones. But looking at the options, let me see what they are.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 3-ethoxybenzamide\nB) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\nC) 4-aminophenyl propionate\nD) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\n\nSo all the options have a benzene ring with substituents, and likely an amide or ester group.\n\nLooking at IR: 1720 cm-1 is a strong band. Esters typically have carbonyls around 1720-1750. Amides have lower wavenumbers, around 1640-1680. So if the IR shows a peak at 1720, maybe it's an ester. So looking at the options, which ones are esters?\n\nOption D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzoate esters have carbonyls around 1720. Option C is a propionate, which is also an ester. Option A is a benzamide, which would have a lower carbonyl. Option B is a formamide, which again is an amide, so lower wavenumber.\n\nSo the IR suggests an ester group, so the options are C and D.\n\nWait, but wait. What about the other IR peaks? The 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those could be N-H from an amine. Because if it's an ester, then the other substituents might have an amino group. Let's think: option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would have an amino group attached to the benzene ring and an ester group (the propionate). So the N-H would be from the amine. That would explain the IR peaks. Similarly, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That's also an ester (the benzoate part) and an amine on the benzene.\n\nSo both options C and D are possible. Let me look at the NMR data.\n\nThe 1H NMR data is as follows:\n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H) \u2192 likely a CH2CH3 group, maybe attached to an oxygen (like an ethyl ester). The triplet suggests it's adjacent to another CH2.\n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) \u2192 broad singlet. That might be an NH group. Or maybe an oxygenated CH2, but broad could be an NH. Alternatively, an OCH2 group. Wait, but if it's an NH, that would explain the IR's N-H peaks.\n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H) \u2192 quartet. A quartet with 2H suggests a -OCH2CH2- group, perhaps. Wait, but quartet and 2H: maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 that's split into a quartet. Like if it's a CH2 connected to another CH2, which is split into a quartet. Wait, but let me think. A quartet (q) in NMR is typically from a CH2 next to another CH2. So for example, in an ethyl group, the -CH2CH3 would be a triplet, and the -CH2- in the middle (like in -OCH2CH2-) would be a quartet if split by adjacent CH2. Wait, but in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 group would have the OCH2 as a quartet (if split by the adjacent CH3). Wait, no, in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet (if the CH3 is a triplet). Wait, no, I think I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think: the ethyl group in an ester is usually OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet because it's next to a CH3 which is a triplet. Wait, no, the OCH2 is adjacent to the CH3, so the OCH2 would have a triplet. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a different group. Let me think about the options.\n\nOption C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate would be OCH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNH2-COO-R, where R is propyl? No, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, propionate is CH3CH2COO-. So the ester would be OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. Hmm, but the NMR shows 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). Let's see, maybe it's a -OCH2- group adjacent to another CH2. Like in a propionate ester, the OCH2CH2- group. The OCH2 would be a quartet because it's next to a CH2 which is a triplet. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the benzoate ester would be OCH2CH3 attached to the carbonyl. So the OCH2 would be a quartet? Wait, no. In ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet (because the adjacent CH3 has three H's, splitting into a quartet). Or wait, the OCH2 would be a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet. So in the NMR, the OCH2 would appear as a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But the data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm for 2H. Hmm, that's a bit higher than the usual ethyl ester OCH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.\n\nLooking at the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) \u2192 broad singlet. Maybe that's an NH2 group. Wait, but amines usually show up as broad signals, but for a -NH2 group, the protons are exchange broadened and may not appear as clear in the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group attached to something else. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and split into a doublet. So the coupling would be between the two sets of protons, leading to a doublet for each. So the aromatic protons are in two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count the substituents.\n\nWait, benzene is C6H6. The formula is C9H11NO2, so subtract C6H5: we have C3H6NO2. So the substituents would be groups adding up to C3H6NO2. But considering the benzene is para-substituted, there would be two substituents on the ring. Wait, but wait, perhaps one substituent is an amino group and another is an ester group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent is a single group that's a combination. Let me think: option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is OEt-CO-NH2 attached to the benzene. Wait, no, the benzoate ester is OEt-CO-O- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, wait. Benzoate ester is benzene ring with a COOEt group. So 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group in the para position relative to the COOEt group. So the benzene has two substituents: NH2 and COOEt.\n\nSo the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets. Because in para substitution, each set of protons (ortho and meta to substituents) would be equivalent and split into doublets. So the NMR data matches that.\n\nNow, looking at the NMR shifts:\n\nThe aromatic protons are at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). The lower shift (7.0) suggests they are less deshielded. So, perhaps the substituents are an amino group and an ester group. The amino group is strongly activating, so the protons ortho and para to it would be more deshielded. Wait, but in this case, the amino group is in the para position relative to the ester group. So the protons on the benzene would be in the ortho and meta positions relative to the amino group. Wait, maybe I'm getting this confused. Let me sketch it.\n\nStructure for D: benzene ring with COOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4 (para). So the protons adjacent to NH2 would be at position 2 and 6 (ortho), and the protons adjacent to COOEt would be at position 3 and 5 (meta). So the ortho protons (2 and 6) would be more deshielded because of the amino group, which is strongly activating (para). Wait, amino is a strong activating group, so the ortho and para protons are more shielded? Or wait, no. Electronegative groups deshield the protons. Wait, amino groups are electron-donating, which would make the ring more electron-rich, so the protons would be more shielded, appearing downfield less. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of substituent effects.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent's electronic effects cause certain shifts. The amino group is strong activating (ortho/para), and the ester group is deactivating (meta directing). So in the benzene ring, the substituents are at para positions. The amino group is a strong activating group, so the protons ortho to it would be more deshielded (appear downfield) compared to the protons next to the ester group.\n\nWait, the ester group is electron-withdrawing, so it would deshield the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield. The amino group is electron-donating, which would shield the adjacent protons, making them appear upfield. So in the NMR, the protons next to the amino group (ortho) would be at lower ppm, and those next to the ester (meta to amino) would be higher.\n\nSo in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) would be the protons ortho to the amino group, and the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) would be the protons meta to the amino group (and ortho to the ester). That makes sense.\n\nNow, looking at the other NMR signals.\n\nThe 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) is likely the ethyl group's CH3. The triplet suggests it's attached to a CH2. So in the ester group, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH3 as a triplet. So that fits with an ethyl ester.\n\nThe 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) would be the OCH2 of the ethyl ester. Wait, in ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 group would have the OCH2 as a quartet. But wait, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. So that would fit. So the OCH2 would be a quartet, integrating to 2H, which matches the NMR data.\n\nThen, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a broad singlet. Hmm. Could that be an NH2 group? But in the structure D, the amino group is attached to the ring. The NH2 would have protons, but they are usually broad and may not show up as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2- group, but I don't think so. Wait, what else could it be?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the broad singlet is from an NH group. But in D, the amino group is NH2. So if it's a secondary amine, maybe it's NH, but D has NH2. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not from the amino group.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe it's the OCH2 from a propionate ester. For example, in option C, which is 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure would be OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. So the OCH2 would be adjacent to another CH2, which is connected to the carbonyl. So the OCH2 would be a quartet, but in the NMR, it's at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). Then the next CH2 (CH2COO-) would be a triplet. Wait, but in the NMR, I don't see a triplet around 4.0 ppm. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, let me think again. In option D, the ethyl ester would have OCH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be at around 4.3-4.4 as a quartet. The given data shows a quartet at 4.5, which is a bit upfield, but maybe due to the substituents. The 1.20 ppm triplet would be the CH3 of the ethyl group.\n\nThen, what about the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)? That's a bit confusing. Maybe it's an NH group, but in D, the NH2 would have protons. But in the NMR, the NH protons are usually broad, but in D, it's a primary amine attached to the ring. So perhaps the NH2 protons are exchange-broadened and appear as a broad peak. But the integration is 2H, which suggests two protons. So in D, the amino group is NH2, so two protons. So the 4.0 ppm could be the NH2 protons. But wait, in the NMR, the amino group protons are usually around 1-5 ppm, but broad. But in D, the amino group is attached to the ring, so it's a para-aminobenzoate ester. So the NH2 would be a broad singlet, perhaps. But wait, in the NMR, the signal is a broad singlet integrating 2H. That could fit.\n\nWait, but the 4.0 ppm is a bit high for NH2 protons. Typically, NH2 protons are around 1-3 ppm, but they can vary. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group. But I don't see an OCH2 elsewhere in the structure.\n\nHmm, let me think about the other options. Option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would have a structure like OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene, which has an NH2 group. So the OCH2CH2 would split into a quartet and a triplet. Wait, the OCH2 would be adjacent to the CH2COO-, so the OCH2 would be a triplet, and the CH2 would be a quartet. Wait, no, the OCH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2, so it would be a quartet. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is in line with that. Then the CH2COO- would be a triplet at around 3.5-4.0 ppm. But in the given data, there's a 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), which might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 group. So for option C, the NH2 would be at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the NH2 is on the benzene ring, which is a strong activating group, but the protons would be exchange-broadened. Maybe in the NMR, it's difficult to see, but the integration is 2H.\n\nWait, but the molecular formula for option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. Let me write it out: PhNH2-COOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, propionate is CH3CH2COO-. So the structure would be OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene, and the benzene also has an NH2 group in the para position. So the OCH2 would be a quartet, and the next CH2 would be a triplet. But in the NMR data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm (2H), which would fit the OCH2. The next CH2 would be a triplet around 3.5-4.0 ppm. But in the data, there's a 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), which doesn't fit a triplet. So maybe that's not right.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the integration. The aromatic region has 4H (2H each). The ethyl group is 3H. The quartet is 2H, the broad singlet is 2H. So total H's accounted for: 3+2+2+4=11, which matches the formula (H11). So that's correct.\n\nNow, considering the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): in option D, the amino group is NH2. So those two H's would be the NH2. But why is their chemical shift at 4.0? That's higher than usual for NH2. Alternatively, perhaps it's not NH2 but something else. Wait, but in the structure, the amino group is attached to the benzene, so the NH2 is directly connected. In such cases, the NH2 protons can show up around 4-5 ppm, but they are broad because of exchange with water. So perhaps that's what's happening here.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe IR shows a strong carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which suggests an ester. The NMR shows a triplet at 1.2 ppm (ethyl CH3), a quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2 of ethyl ester), and a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (NH2). The aromatic protons are two doublets, indicating a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, likely an amino group and an ester group.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which fits this description. The structure would have a benzene ring with COOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. The NMR data matches this: the ethyl group, the NH2, and the aromatic protons.\n\nWait, but what about option C? Let's think again. Option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the ester is a propyl group. The NMR would have a triplet and a quartet for the propyl chain. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5 and the triplet isn't observed. So perhaps option D is more likely.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound C9H11NO2 is based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So, (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. Let's compute that: 20-11=9, plus 1 is 10. 10 divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a combination of rings and double bonds. For example, a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees) plus an amide group (which has a double bond and a ring? Wait, no. An amide has a carbonyl (1 double bond) and maybe another ring. Hmm, maybe a benzene ring (3) plus an ester or amide group (each has a carbonyl, so 1 each). So 3 + 1 + 1 (maybe a double bond elsewhere or another ring?), but wait, let me think. Alternatively, perhaps a benzene ring (3) and an amide group (which has a carbonyl and an amine, but the amine is saturated). So maybe the amide contributes one double bond. So that's 3+1=4. Then another double bond, or a ring? Maybe another ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the compound could have a benzene ring, an ester group (like an ethyl ester), which would add another double bond (from the carbonyl). So that gives 3+1=4. Then another double bond, maybe from an amide? Wait, but amide is a carbonyl, so that's another. Wait, maybe the structure is a benzamide with some substituents.\n\nLooking at the IR data: strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H stretches. Wait, but wait, those could also be O-H stretches, but O-H typically shows a broad peak around 3200-3600. But the given peaks are medium to strong. For N-H, like in amines or amides, which would have peaks around 3300-3500. The presence of two peaks suggests two different N-H environments? Or maybe they are from different groups. Hmm. Alternatively, if it's an amine, the N-H would show a peak around there. But let's also check the other IR data: a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak. Which functional groups have that? Esters, amides, ketones. But looking at the options, let me see what they are.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 3-ethoxybenzamide\nB) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\nC) 4-aminophenyl propionate\nD) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\n\nSo all the options have a benzene ring with substituents, and likely an amide or ester group.\n\nLooking at IR: 1720 cm-1 is a strong band. Esters typically have carbonyls around 1720-1750. Amides have lower wavenumbers, around 1640-1680. So if the IR shows a peak at 1720, maybe it's an ester. So looking at the options, which ones are esters?\n\nOption D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzoate esters have carbonyls around 1720. Option C is a propionate, which is also an ester. Option A is a benzamide, which would have a lower carbonyl. Option B is a formamide, which again is an amide, so lower wavenumber.\n\nSo the IR suggests an ester group, so the options are C and D.\n\nWait, but wait. What about the other IR peaks? The 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those could be N-H from an amine. Because if it's an ester, then the other substituents might have an amino group. Let's think: option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would have an amino group attached to the benzene ring and an ester group (the propionate). So the N-H would be from the amine. That would explain the IR peaks. Similarly, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That's also an ester (the benzoate part) and an amine on the benzene.\n\nSo both options C and D are possible. Let me look at the NMR data.\n\nThe 1H NMR data is as follows:\n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H) \u2192 likely a CH2CH3 group, maybe attached to an oxygen (like an ethyl ester). The triplet suggests it's adjacent to another CH2.\n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) \u2192 broad singlet. That might be an NH group. Or maybe an oxygenated CH2, but broad could be an NH. Alternatively, an OCH2 group. Wait, but if it's an NH, that would explain the IR's N-H peaks.\n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H) \u2192 quartet. A quartet with 2H suggests a -OCH2CH2- group, perhaps. Wait, but quartet and 2H: maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 that's split into a quartet. Like if it's a CH2 connected to another CH2, which is split into a quartet. Wait, but let me think. A quartet (q) in NMR is typically from a CH2 next to another CH2. So for example, in an ethyl group, the -CH2CH3 would be a triplet, and the -CH2- in the middle (like in -OCH2CH2-) would be a quartet if split by adjacent CH2. Wait, but in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 group would have the OCH2 as a quartet (if split by the adjacent CH3). Wait, no, in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet (if the CH3 is a triplet). Wait, no, I think I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think: the ethyl group in an ester is usually OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet because it's next to a CH3 which is a triplet. Wait, no, the OCH2 is adjacent to the CH3, so the OCH2 would have a triplet. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a different group. Let me think about the options.\n\nOption C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate would be OCH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNH2-COO-R, where R is propyl? No, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, propionate is CH3CH2COO-. So the ester would be OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. Hmm, but the NMR shows 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). Let's see, maybe it's a -OCH2- group adjacent to another CH2. Like in a propionate ester, the OCH2CH2- group. The OCH2 would be a quartet because it's next to a CH2 which is a triplet. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the benzoate ester would be OCH2CH3 attached to the carbonyl. So the OCH2 would be a quartet? Wait, no. In ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet (because the adjacent CH3 has three H's, splitting into a quartet). Or wait, the OCH2 would be a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet. So in the NMR, the OCH2 would appear as a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But the data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm for 2H. Hmm, that's a bit higher than the usual ethyl ester OCH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.\n\nLooking at the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) \u2192 broad singlet. Maybe that's an NH2 group. Wait, but amines usually show up as broad signals, but for a -NH2 group, the protons are exchange broadened and may not appear as clear in the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group attached to something else. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and split into a doublet. So the coupling would be between the two sets of protons, leading to a doublet for each. So the aromatic protons are in two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count the substituents.\n\nWait, benzene is C6H6. The formula is C9H11NO2, so subtract C6H5: we have C3H6NO2. So the substituents would be groups adding up to C3H6NO2. But considering the benzene is para-substituted, there would be two substituents on the ring. Wait, but wait, perhaps one substituent is an amino group and another is an ester group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent is a single group that's a combination. Let me think: option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is OEt-CO-NH2 attached to the benzene. Wait, no, the benzoate ester is OEt-CO-O- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, wait. Benzoate ester is benzene ring with a COOEt group. So 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group in the para position relative to the COOEt group. So the benzene has two substituents: NH2 and COOEt.\n\nSo the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets. Because in para substitution, each set of protons (ortho and meta to substituents) would be equivalent and split into doublets. So the NMR data matches that.\n\nNow, looking at the NMR shifts:\n\nThe aromatic protons are at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). The lower shift (7.0) suggests they are less deshielded. So, perhaps the substituents are an amino group and an ester group. The amino group is strongly activating, so the protons ortho and para to it would be more deshielded. Wait, but in this case, the amino group is in the para position relative to the ester group. So the protons on the benzene would be in the ortho and meta positions relative to the amino group. Wait, maybe I'm getting this confused. Let me sketch it.\n\nStructure for D: benzene ring with COOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4 (para). So the protons adjacent to NH2 would be at position 2 and 6 (ortho), and the protons adjacent to COOEt would be at position 3 and 5 (meta). So the ortho protons (2 and 6) would be more deshielded because of the amino group, which is strongly activating (para). Wait, amino is a strong activating group, so the ortho and para protons are more shielded? Or wait, no. Electronegative groups deshield the protons. Wait, amino groups are electron-donating, which would make the ring more electron-rich, so the protons would be more shielded, appearing downfield less. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of substituent effects.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent's electronic effects cause certain shifts. The amino group is strong activating (ortho/para), and the ester group is deactivating (meta directing). So in the benzene ring, the substituents are at para positions. The amino group is a strong activating group, so the protons ortho to it would be more deshielded (appear downfield) compared to the protons next to the ester group.\n\nWait, the ester group is electron-withdrawing, so it would deshield the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield. The amino group is electron-donating, which would shield the adjacent protons, making them appear upfield. So in the NMR, the protons next to the amino group (ortho) would be at lower ppm, and those next to the ester (meta to amino) would be higher.\n\nSo in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) would be the protons ortho to the amino group, and the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) would be the protons meta to the amino group (and ortho to the ester). That makes sense.\n\nNow, looking at the other NMR signals.\n\nThe 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) is likely the ethyl group's CH3. The triplet suggests it's attached to a CH2. So in the ester group, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH3 as a triplet. So that fits with an ethyl ester.\n\nThe 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) would be the OCH2 of the ethyl ester. Wait, in ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 group would have the OCH2 as a quartet. But wait, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. So that would fit. So the OCH2 would be a quartet, integrating to 2H, which matches the NMR data.\n\nThen, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a broad singlet. Hmm. Could that be an NH2 group? But in the structure D, the amino group is attached to the ring. The NH2 would have protons, but they are usually broad and may not show up as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2- group, but I don't think so. Wait, what else could it be?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the broad singlet is from an NH group. But in D, the amino group is NH2. So if it's a secondary amine, maybe it's NH, but D has NH2. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not from the amino group.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe it's the OCH2 from a propionate ester. For example, in option C, which is 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure would be OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. So the OCH2 would be adjacent to another CH2, which is connected to the carbonyl. So the OCH2 would be a quartet, but in the NMR, it's at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). Then the next CH2 (CH2COO-) would be a triplet. Wait, but in the NMR, I don't see a triplet around 4.0 ppm. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, let me think again. In option D, the ethyl ester would have OCH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be at around 4.3-4.4 as a quartet. The given data shows a quartet at 4.5, which is a bit upfield, but maybe due to the substituents. The 1.20 ppm triplet would be the CH3 of the ethyl group.\n\nThen, what about the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)? That's a bit confusing. Maybe it's an NH group, but in D, the NH2 would have protons. But in the NMR, the NH protons are usually broad, but in D, it's a primary amine attached to the ring. So perhaps the NH2 protons are exchange-broadened and appear as a broad peak. But the integration is 2H, which suggests two protons. So in D, the amino group is NH2, so two protons. So the 4.0 ppm could be the NH2 protons. But wait, in the NMR, the amino group protons are usually around 1-5 ppm, but broad. But in D, the amino group is attached to the ring, so it's a para-aminobenzoate ester. So the NH2 would be a broad singlet, perhaps. But wait, in the NMR, the signal is a broad singlet integrating 2H. That could fit.\n\nWait, but the 4.0 ppm is a bit high for NH2 protons. Typically, NH2 protons are around 1-3 ppm, but they can vary. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group. But I don't see an OCH2 elsewhere in the structure.\n\nHmm, let me think about the other options. Option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would have a structure like OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene, which has an NH2 group. So the OCH2CH2 would split into a quartet and a triplet. Wait, the OCH2 would be adjacent to the CH2COO-, so the OCH2 would be a triplet, and the CH2 would be a quartet. Wait, no, the OCH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2, so it would be a quartet. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is in line with that. Then the CH2COO- would be a triplet at around 3.5-4.0 ppm. But in the given data, there's a 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), which might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 group. So for option C, the NH2 would be at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the NH2 is on the benzene ring, which is a strong activating group, but the protons would be exchange-broadened. Maybe in the NMR, it's difficult to see, but the integration is 2H.\n\nWait, but the molecular formula for option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. Let me write it out: PhNH2-COOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, propionate is CH3CH2COO-. So the structure would be OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene, and the benzene also has an NH2 group in the para position. So the OCH2 would be a quartet, and the next CH2 would be a triplet. But in the NMR data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm (2H), which would fit the OCH2. The next CH2 would be a triplet around 3.5-4.0 ppm. But in the data, there's a 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), which doesn't fit a triplet. So maybe that's not right.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the integration. The aromatic region has 4H (2H each). The ethyl group is 3H. The quartet is 2H, the broad singlet is 2H. So total H's accounted for: 3+2+2+4=11, which matches the formula (H11). So that's correct.\n\nNow, considering the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): in option D, the amino group is NH2. So those two H's would be the NH2. But why is their chemical shift at 4.0? That's higher than usual for NH2. Alternatively, perhaps it's not NH2 but something else. Wait, but in the structure, the amino group is attached to the benzene, so the NH2 is directly connected. In such cases, the NH2 protons can show up around 4-5 ppm, but they are broad because of exchange with water. So perhaps that's what's happening here.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe IR shows a strong carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which suggests an ester. The NMR shows a triplet at 1.2 ppm (ethyl CH3), a quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2 of ethyl ester), and a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (NH2). The aromatic protons are two doublets, indicating a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, likely an amino group and an ester group.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which fits this description. The structure would have a benzene ring with COOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. The NMR data matches this: the ethyl group, the NH2, and the aromatic protons.\n\nWait, but what about option C? Let's think again. Option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the ester is a propyl group. The NMR would have a triplet and a quartet for the propyl chain. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5 and the triplet isn't observed. So perhaps option D is more likely.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n\nTo identify the compound C9H11NO2, we analyze the spectroscopic data and the given options.\n\n### Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\nThe molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**, and the degree of unsaturation is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Degree of Unsaturation} = \\frac{(2C + 2 - H + N)}{2} = \\frac{(2(9) + 2 - 11 + 1)}{2} = 5\n\\]\n\nThis indicates the presence of a benzene ring (3 degrees of unsaturation) and additional unsaturation likely from a carbonyl group (e.g., ester or amide).\n\n---\n\n### IR Data Analysis\n- **3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9**: These are medium to strong bands, likely due to N-H stretching, suggesting the presence of an amine or amide group.\n- **1720 cm\u207b\u00b9**: A strong carbonyl stretch, characteristic of an ester group.\n\nThe IR data suggests the compound contains both an **ester** and an **amine/amide** group.\n\n---\n\n### \u00b9H NMR Data Analysis\n1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, indicative of a CH3 group in an ethyl ester (-CH2CH3).\n2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, likely corresponding to the NH2 group of an amine.\n3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, characteristic of the OCH2 group in an ethyl ester.\n4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nThe NMR data supports the presence of a **para-substituted benzene** with two substituents: one being an **ethyl ester** (COOCH2CH3) and the other an **amine group** (NH2).\n\n---\n\n### Option Analysis\n- **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: Contains an ethoxy group and an amide, but the IR data does not support an amide (carbonyl stretch would be lower than 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy, so degrees of unsaturation are (2n + 2 - m - x - y)/2. Plugging in the numbers: n=9, m=11, x=2, y=1. So, (2*9 + 2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2 = 6/2 =3. So, three degrees of unsaturation. That could mean three rings, but more likely a combination of rings and double bonds. Probably a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees by itself) plus maybe a double bond or another ring.\n\nNow looking at the IR data. Strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad, which suggests N-H stretching (like amide or amine groups). Wait, but they're in the 3400s, which is typical for N-H. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, probably an ester or amide since the other options would have different regions. For example, a ketone is around 1700, but esters and amides are a bit higher. So, that suggests either an ester or amide group.\n\nLooking at the 1H NMR data:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a methyl group attached to something with two protons. So maybe an ethyl group, like CH2CH3. The triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons, like in an ethyl group (CH2CH3) where the CH2 is next to another CH2.\n\n- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. That could be an ethyl group's oxygenated CH2, like OCH2CH3. Or maybe an NH group, but the integration is 2H, so not NH. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2 next to an electronegative atom, like an ester's OCH2.\n\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. A quartet often comes from a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, which is split into a quartet. So maybe another oxygenated CH2 group. Like OCH2CH2O or something similar. Or perhaps a carbonyl adjacent to CH2, like in an ester group (COOCH2CH3). Wait, in an ester, the OCH2CH3 would be split by the adjacent OCH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 next to another CH2, so a quartet.\n\n- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, 2H. This suggests aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring, since each proton is only next to one other, but wait, if they're in a para position, each would be a singlet if there are two substituents. Hmm, maybe it's a meta substitution or another scenario. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,2-disubstituted benzene, but that would give more complex splitting. Wait, the integration is 2H, so maybe a pair of protons in a para-substituted ring, each coupled to each other. Like a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each having one proton. Or perhaps it's a substituent with two protons, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted ring where each substituent has a proton, and they're coupled. For example, in a para-substituted benzamide, where the amide is attached para, but that would have more than two protons.\n\nWait, no. The aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the aromatic ring has four protons, split into two doublets. That suggests a 1,4-disubstituted benzene (para substitution). So, two substituents on the ring, each in para positions, leading to two sets of doublets. For example, if the ring has two substituents, each with a proton, then each proton would couple with the other. Alternatively, each substituent could be a group with two protons, but that might complicate the splitting.\n\nWait, looking back, the aromatic region has two doublets: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). So four protons in total on the aromatic ring. So that's a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Each substituent is a group that takes away two protons, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, each substituent would replace one hydrogen. So if the ring has two substituents in para positions, each substituent would have an H that's adjacent to the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are groups that don't have H, but that would leave four H on the ring. For example, if the substituents are two meta-directing groups, but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps the substituents are in positions 1 and 3 (meta), but that might complicate the splitting. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is a group that has a single H, like a -NH2 or -NO2. Hmm, but the molecular formula includes an O2 and N, so maybe one substituent is an amide or ester group.\n\nWait, the NMR data shows that the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, for a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions, each substituent would cause the adjacent H to be deshielded. So, for example, if substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B is at position 4 (para), then the H at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to substituent A, and H at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to substituent B. Each pair would couple with each other, leading to two doublets. So each doublet would have two H. So that fits the data.\n\nNow, looking at the other NMR signals. The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) and the 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H). Let's think about possible structures.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. So, the benzamide group is CONH2, but wait, benzamide is PhCONH2. Wait, but the molecular formula of option A would be C9H11NO2. Let's see: benzamide is C7H7NO2, but with ethoxy substitution, which would add C2H5O, so the formula becomes C9H11NO2. Yes, that fits.\n\nSo, the structure would be O\n\nPh-OCH2CH3 at position 3, and the benzamide group at another position. Wait, but 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the ethoxy at position 3 and the amide at position 1 or something else. Wait, but the benzamide group would be in position 1, making it para to the ethoxy in position 3? No, because 3 is meta to 1. So, the substituents would be in positions 1 (amide) and 3 (ethoxy). Then, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,4,5,6. Each of those would be split into doublets based on their coupling. Hmm, but in the NMR, we have two doublets. So maybe the substituents are in positions 4 and something else? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, making the aromatic Hs in positions 2,3,5,6.\n\nWait, perhaps the substituents are in positions 4 and 1, but that's getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, but that would make it para. Let me think again.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would be Ph-OCH2CH3 at position 4, and the formamide group is HCONH- attached to the benzene. Wait, no: formamide is HCONH2. So N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would have the formamide group attached to the benzene in position 4, so the structure would be Ph-OCH2CH3 in position 4, and the formamide group (HCONH-) attached to position 4 as well? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. The formamide would be HCONHPh, where the Ph is 4-ethoxy. So the benzene ring has an ethoxy group in position 4 and the formamide group attached to position 1, perhaps. But wait, the substituents would be in positions 1 and 4, leading to a para-substituted benzene, so the aromatic Hs would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Each pair would be split into doublets, as each H would be adjacent to substituents.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So that would be a benzene ring with an NH2 group in position 4 and a propionate group (CH2CH2COO-) attached. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be NH2PhCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count: benzene (C6H5), then NH2 (C0H2N), and propionate (C3H5O2). Wait, but that would make C6 + 3 = C9, H: 5 (from benzene) + 2 (NH2) +5 (propionate) = 12. But the formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's O\n\nPhNH2 attached to a propionoate ester or something else. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, that would be a benzamide with a propyl ester. But the formula would be C9H11NO2? Let me count: benzene (6 C), NH2 (1 N), COO (2 O), and propyl (3 C). So total C:6+3=9. O:2 from COO. N:1. So yes, C9H11NO2. The structure would be O\n\nPhNH2-COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Because propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester would be O\n\nPhNH2-COOCH2CH2CH3. But that would make the molecular formula C9H11NO2? Let's see: benzene (6 C), NH2 (no C), COO (2 O), and propyl (3 C) \u2192 6+3=9 C. H: Benzene has 5 H (if substituted in one position), NH2 has 2 H, COO has O, and propyl has 7 H (CH2CH2CH3). Wait, but the ester group would be O\n\nO-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So the ester would have 3 C and 7 H (from CH2CH2CH3). So the total H would be 5 (benzene) + 2 (NH2) + 7 (propyl) = 14 H. But the formula is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So that doesn't fit. So maybe this option is not correct.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O\n\nBenzoate ester with an ethyl group. So the benzoate is O\n\nO-CO-OCH2CH3, attached to the benzene ring, and the 4-aminophenyl group. Wait, no: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be the benzoate ester where the benzene has an amino group in position 4. So structure is O\n\nO-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene, which also has an NH2 group in position 4. So the benzene has two substituents: COOEt and NH2 in para positions.\n\nSo, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Each H in positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to substituents (COOEt and NH2), and similarly for positions 3 and 5. But wait, in this case, the substituents are in positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). So the adjacent Hs would be in positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOEt) and positions 3 and 5 (ortho to NH2). Each pair would be split into doublets. That would give two doublets in the aromatic region, integrating to 2H each. That matches the NMR data.\n\nNow, looking at the other NMR signals. Let's see:\n\nIn option D, the ester group is COOEt. So the ethyl group would be split into a quartet and a triplet. The ethyl ester group typically shows up as a triplet around 4.1-4.3 ppm for the OCH2 and a quartet around 1.2-1.4 ppm for the CH2CH3. But in the given NMR data, we have:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): likely the CH2CH3 group of an ethyl ester. So that's the triplet for the CH2CH3.\n\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): quartet, probably the OCH2 of the ester. Wait, but usually the OCH2 in esters is around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. So 4.5 might be a bit upfield, but possible.\n\nBut looking at the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit with an ester, which would have a quartet for the OCH2. Alternatively, perhaps it's another group.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible structures again. If option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is O\n\nO-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, which also has NH2 in para. So the NH2 would be in position 4. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Let's see how the coupling would work. The H in position 2 is next to substituent COOEt (position 1) and H in position 6. The H in position 6 is next to substituent COOEt (position 1) and H in position 2. Similarly, H in position 3 is next to substituent NH2 (position 4) and H in position 5. H in position 5 is next to substituent NH2 (position 4) and H in position 3. So each pair (2&6 and 3&5) would couple, leading to two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. That fits the NMR.\n\nNow, looking at the other signals:\n\nThe ethyl ester group would have a triplet at ~1.2 ppm (CH2CH3) and a quartet at ~4.1 ppm (OCH2). But in the given data, we have a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) and a triplet at 1.2. So that matches the ethyl group. But where is the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)? Hmm, that's a broad singlet. Maybe that's the NH2 group. But NH2 protons are usually broad, but in this case, the integration is 2H. Wait, in the structure, the NH2 would be a singlet, but in the NMR, it's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. Wait, but amines or amides can show up in that region. Wait, but in the structure of option D, the NH2 is part of the benzene ring. So in the NMR, the NH2 protons would typically appear as a broad peak, possibly as a singlet. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So that could correspond to the NH2 group.\n\nWait, but in the structure of option D, the NH2 would be on the benzene ring, so the NH2 protons would be around 2-3 ppm if they're aromatic amines. Wait, no, aromatic amines (like aniline) have NH2 protons that are usually broad and around 5-7 ppm, but that's when the NH2 is directly attached to the ring. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think: in aniline, the NH2 protons are around 4-5 ppm, but they can be deshielded and appear as a broad peak. So in the NMR, the NH2 would be a broad peak, possibly around 4.0 ppm. So that fits with the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) in the data.\n\nWait, but looking back, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If that's the NH2 group, then that makes sense. So in option D, the NH2 would be in para to the ester group.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe aromatic region has two doublets (7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each 2H), which fits a para-substituted benzene with two substituents (COOEt and NH2). The ethyl ester would show a triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH2CH3) and a quartet around 4.5 ppm (OCH2). The NH2 would be a broad singlet around 4.0 ppm. But wait, in the data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm (2H), which would correspond to the OCH2 of the ester. The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) would be the NH2 protons. But wait, NH2 protons are usually broad, but would they integrate to 2H? Because each NH2 has two H, so yes.\n\nSo that matches option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nLet me check the other options.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is O\n\nPh-OCH2CH3 in position 4, and formamide (HCONH-) attached to position 1. So the formamide would have the structure HCONHPh, where Ph is 4-ethoxy. The aromatic Hs would be in positions 2,3,5,6, each coupled as doublets. So that would fit the aromatic NMR. The formamide group has an NH, which would show up as a broad peak. The ethoxy group would have a triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH2CH3) and a quartet around 4.0 ppm (OCH2). But the formamide's NH would be around 8 ppm as an amide, but I'm not sure. Wait, formamide's NH would be around 8 ppm, but in the data, the NH is at 4.0 ppm. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe option B is not correct.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. So benzamide is PhCONH2. So substituents at 3 and 1 (CONH2 and OCH2CH3). The aromatic Hs would be in positions 2,4,5,6. Each pair would be split into doublets, which fits the NMR. The ethoxy would show triplet at 1.2 ppm and quartet at 4.0 ppm. The CONH2 group would have NH2 protons. But in the data, the NH2 would appear as a broad peak, possibly around 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). However, in this structure, the benzamide's NH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl, so the protons would be more deshielded and perhaps appear around 6-8 ppm, which doesn't fit the 4.0 ppm signal. So maybe option A is not correct.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would have an NH2 group in position 4 and a propionate ester. The propionate would be O\n\nCOOCH2CH2CH3. So the aromatic Hs would be in positions 2,3,5,6, giving two doublets. The propionate's ethyl group would have triplet at 1.2 ppm and quartet at 4.5 ppm, but the OCH2 would be around 4.1. The NH2 would be a broad singlet around 4.0 ppm. But the propionate's structure would have a longer chain. However, earlier I thought the H count didn't match, but let me recheck. The formula for option C would be C9H11NO2? Benzene (C6H5) + NH2 (C0H2N) + propionate (C3H5O2). So total C:6+3=9. O:2. N:1. H:5 (benzene) +2 (NH2) +5 (propionate) =12. But the formula is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nSo, based on the analysis, option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate seems to fit all the data. The aromatic protons match the para substitution, the ethyl ester gives the triplet and quartet, and the NH2 gives the broad singlet.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy, so degrees of unsaturation are (2n + 2 - m - x - y)/2. Plugging in the numbers: n=9, m=11, x=2, y=1. So, (2*9 + 2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2 = 6/2 =3. So, three degrees of unsaturation. That could mean three rings, but more likely a combination of rings and double bonds. Probably a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees by itself) plus maybe a double bond or another ring.\n\nNow looking at the IR data. Strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad, which suggests N-H stretching (like amide or amine groups). Wait, but they're in the 3400s, which is typical for N-H. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, probably an ester or amide since the other options would have different regions. For example, a ketone is around 1700, but esters and amides are a bit higher. So, that suggests either an ester or amide group.\n\nLooking at the 1H NMR data:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a methyl group attached to something with two protons. So maybe an ethyl group, like CH2CH3. The triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons, like in an ethyl group (CH2CH3) where the CH2 is next to another CH2.\n\n- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. That could be an ethyl group's oxygenated CH2, like OCH2CH3. Or maybe an NH group, but the integration is 2H, so not NH. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2 next to an electronegative atom, like an ester's OCH2.\n\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. A quartet often comes from a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, which is split into a quartet. So maybe another oxygenated CH2 group. Like OCH2CH2O or something similar. Or perhaps a carbonyl adjacent to CH2, like in an ester group (COOCH2CH3). Wait, in an ester, the OCH2CH3 would be split by the adjacent OCH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 next to another CH2, so a quartet.\n\n- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, 2H. This suggests aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring, since each proton is only next to one other, but wait, if they're in a para position, each would be a singlet if there are two substituents. Hmm, maybe it's a meta substitution or another scenario. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,2-disubstituted benzene, but that would give more complex splitting. Wait, the integration is 2H, so maybe a pair of protons in a para-substituted ring, each coupled to each other. Like a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each having one proton. Or perhaps it's a substituent with two protons, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted ring where each substituent has a proton, and they're coupled. For example, in a para-substituted benzamide, where the amide is attached para, but that would have more than two protons.\n\nWait, no. The aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the aromatic ring has four protons, split into two doublets. That suggests a 1,4-disubstituted benzene (para substitution). So, two substituents on the ring, each in para positions, leading to two sets of doublets. For example, if the ring has two substituents, each with a proton, then each proton would couple with the other. Alternatively, each substituent could be a group with two protons, but that might complicate the splitting.\n\nWait, looking back, the aromatic region has two doublets: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). So four protons in total on the aromatic ring. So that's a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Each substituent is a group that takes away two protons, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, each substituent would replace one hydrogen. So if the ring has two substituents in para positions, each substituent would have an H that's adjacent to the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are groups that don't have H, but that would leave four H on the ring. For example, if the substituents are two meta-directing groups, but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps the substituents are in positions 1 and 3 (meta), but that might complicate the splitting. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is a group that has a single H, like a -NH2 or -NO2. Hmm, but the molecular formula includes an O2 and N, so maybe one substituent is an amide or ester group.\n\nWait, the NMR data shows that the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, for a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions, each substituent would cause the adjacent H to be deshielded. So, for example, if substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B is at position 4 (para), then the H at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to substituent A, and H at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to substituent B. Each pair would couple with each other, leading to two doublets. So each doublet would have two H. So that fits the data.\n\nNow, looking at the other NMR signals. The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) and the 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H). Let's think about possible structures.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. So, the benzamide group is CONH2, but wait, benzamide is PhCONH2. Wait, but the molecular formula of option A would be C9H11NO2. Let's see: benzamide is C7H7NO2, but with ethoxy substitution, which would add C2H5O, so the formula becomes C9H11NO2. Yes, that fits.\n\nSo, the structure would be O\n\nPh-OCH2CH3 at position 3, and the benzamide group at another position. Wait, but 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the ethoxy at position 3 and the amide at position 1 or something else. Wait, but the benzamide group would be in position 1, making it para to the ethoxy in position 3? No, because 3 is meta to 1. So, the substituents would be in positions 1 (amide) and 3 (ethoxy). Then, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,4,5,6. Each of those would be split into doublets based on their coupling. Hmm, but in the NMR, we have two doublets. So maybe the substituents are in positions 4 and something else? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, making the aromatic Hs in positions 2,3,5,6.\n\nWait, perhaps the substituents are in positions 4 and 1, but that's getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, but that would make it para. Let me think again.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would be Ph-OCH2CH3 at position 4, and the formamide group is HCONH- attached to the benzene. Wait, no: formamide is HCONH2. So N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would have the formamide group attached to the benzene in position 4, so the structure would be Ph-OCH2CH3 in position 4, and the formamide group (HCONH-) attached to position 4 as well? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. The formamide would be HCONHPh, where the Ph is 4-ethoxy. So the benzene ring has an ethoxy group in position 4 and the formamide group attached to position 1, perhaps. But wait, the substituents would be in positions 1 and 4, leading to a para-substituted benzene, so the aromatic Hs would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Each pair would be split into doublets, as each H would be adjacent to substituents.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So that would be a benzene ring with an NH2 group in position 4 and a propionate group (CH2CH2COO-) attached. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be NH2PhCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count: benzene (C6H5), then NH2 (C0H2N), and propionate (C3H5O2). Wait, but that would make C6 + 3 = C9, H: 5 (from benzene) + 2 (NH2) +5 (propionate) = 12. But the formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's O\n\nPhNH2 attached to a propionoate ester or something else. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, that would be a benzamide with a propyl ester. But the formula would be C9H11NO2? Let me count: benzene (6 C), NH2 (1 N), COO (2 O), and propyl (3 C). So total C:6+3=9. O:2 from COO. N:1. So yes, C9H11NO2. The structure would be O\n\nPhNH2-COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Because propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester would be O\n\nPhNH2-COOCH2CH2CH3. But that would make the molecular formula C9H11NO2? Let's see: benzene (6 C), NH2 (no C), COO (2 O), and propyl (3 C) \u2192 6+3=9 C. H: Benzene has 5 H (if substituted in one position), NH2 has 2 H, COO has O, and propyl has 7 H (CH2CH2CH3). Wait, but the ester group would be O\n\nO-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So the ester would have 3 C and 7 H (from CH2CH2CH3). So the total H would be 5 (benzene) + 2 (NH2) + 7 (propyl) = 14 H. But the formula is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So that doesn't fit. So maybe this option is not correct.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O\n\nBenzoate ester with an ethyl group. So the benzoate is O\n\nO-CO-OCH2CH3, attached to the benzene ring, and the 4-aminophenyl group. Wait, no: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be the benzoate ester where the benzene has an amino group in position 4. So structure is O\n\nO-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene, which also has an NH2 group in position 4. So the benzene has two substituents: COOEt and NH2 in para positions.\n\nSo, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Each H in positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to substituents (COOEt and NH2), and similarly for positions 3 and 5. But wait, in this case, the substituents are in positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). So the adjacent Hs would be in positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOEt) and positions 3 and 5 (ortho to NH2). Each pair would be split into doublets. That would give two doublets in the aromatic region, integrating to 2H each. That matches the NMR data.\n\nNow, looking at the other NMR signals. Let's see:\n\nIn option D, the ester group is COOEt. So the ethyl group would be split into a quartet and a triplet. The ethyl ester group typically shows up as a triplet around 4.1-4.3 ppm for the OCH2 and a quartet around 1.2-1.4 ppm for the CH2CH3. But in the given NMR data, we have:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): likely the CH2CH3 group of an ethyl ester. So that's the triplet for the CH2CH3.\n\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): quartet, probably the OCH2 of the ester. Wait, but usually the OCH2 in esters is around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. So 4.5 might be a bit upfield, but possible.\n\nBut looking at the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit with an ester, which would have a quartet for the OCH2. Alternatively, perhaps it's another group.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible structures again. If option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is O\n\nO-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, which also has NH2 in para. So the NH2 would be in position 4. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Let's see how the coupling would work. The H in position 2 is next to substituent COOEt (position 1) and H in position 6. The H in position 6 is next to substituent COOEt (position 1) and H in position 2. Similarly, H in position 3 is next to substituent NH2 (position 4) and H in position 5. H in position 5 is next to substituent NH2 (position 4) and H in position 3. So each pair (2&6 and 3&5) would couple, leading to two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. That fits the NMR.\n\nNow, looking at the other signals:\n\nThe ethyl ester group would have a triplet at ~1.2 ppm (CH2CH3) and a quartet at ~4.1 ppm (OCH2). But in the given data, we have a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) and a triplet at 1.2. So that matches the ethyl group. But where is the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)? Hmm, that's a broad singlet. Maybe that's the NH2 group. But NH2 protons are usually broad, but in this case, the integration is 2H. Wait, in the structure, the NH2 would be a singlet, but in the NMR, it's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. Wait, but amines or amides can show up in that region. Wait, but in the structure of option D, the NH2 is part of the benzene ring. So in the NMR, the NH2 protons would typically appear as a broad peak, possibly as a singlet. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So that could correspond to the NH2 group.\n\nWait, but in the structure of option D, the NH2 would be on the benzene ring, so the NH2 protons would be around 2-3 ppm if they're aromatic amines. Wait, no, aromatic amines (like aniline) have NH2 protons that are usually broad and around 5-7 ppm, but that's when the NH2 is directly attached to the ring. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think: in aniline, the NH2 protons are around 4-5 ppm, but they can be deshielded and appear as a broad peak. So in the NMR, the NH2 would be a broad peak, possibly around 4.0 ppm. So that fits with the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) in the data.\n\nWait, but looking back, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If that's the NH2 group, then that makes sense. So in option D, the NH2 would be in para to the ester group.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe aromatic region has two doublets (7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each 2H), which fits a para-substituted benzene with two substituents (COOEt and NH2). The ethyl ester would show a triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH2CH3) and a quartet around 4.5 ppm (OCH2). The NH2 would be a broad singlet around 4.0 ppm. But wait, in the data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm (2H), which would correspond to the OCH2 of the ester. The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) would be the NH2 protons. But wait, NH2 protons are usually broad, but would they integrate to 2H? Because each NH2 has two H, so yes.\n\nSo that matches option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nLet me check the other options.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is O\n\nPh-OCH2CH3 in position 4, and formamide (HCONH-) attached to position 1. So the formamide would have the structure HCONHPh, where Ph is 4-ethoxy. The aromatic Hs would be in positions 2,3,5,6, each coupled as doublets. So that would fit the aromatic NMR. The formamide group has an NH, which would show up as a broad peak. The ethoxy group would have a triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH2CH3) and a quartet around 4.0 ppm (OCH2). But the formamide's NH would be around 8 ppm as an amide, but I'm not sure. Wait, formamide's NH would be around 8 ppm, but in the data, the NH is at 4.0 ppm. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe option B is not correct.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. So benzamide is PhCONH2. So substituents at 3 and 1 (CONH2 and OCH2CH3). The aromatic Hs would be in positions 2,4,5,6. Each pair would be split into doublets, which fits the NMR. The ethoxy would show triplet at 1.2 ppm and quartet at 4.0 ppm. The CONH2 group would have NH2 protons. But in the data, the NH2 would appear as a broad peak, possibly around 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). However, in this structure, the benzamide's NH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl, so the protons would be more deshielded and perhaps appear around 6-8 ppm, which doesn't fit the 4.0 ppm signal. So maybe option A is not correct.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would have an NH2 group in position 4 and a propionate ester. The propionate would be O\n\nCOOCH2CH2CH3. So the aromatic Hs would be in positions 2,3,5,6, giving two doublets. The propionate's ethyl group would have triplet at 1.2 ppm and quartet at 4.5 ppm, but the OCH2 would be around 4.1. The NH2 would be a broad singlet around 4.0 ppm. But the propionate's structure would have a longer chain. However, earlier I thought the H count didn't match, but let me recheck. The formula for option C would be C9H11NO2? Benzene (C6H5) + NH2 (C0H2N) + propionate (C3H5O2). So total C:6+3=9. O:2. N:1. H:5 (benzene) +2 (NH2) +5 (propionate) =12. But the formula is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nSo, based on the analysis, option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate seems to fit all the data. The aromatic protons match the para substitution, the ethyl ester gives the triplet and quartet, and the NH2 gives the broad singlet.\n\n\nTo identify the compound C9H11NO2, we analyze the spectroscopic data and compare it with the given options.\n\n### Molecular Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation\nThe molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**, and the degrees of unsaturation are calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Degrees of Unsaturation} = \\frac{(2n + 2 - m - x - y)}{2} = \\frac{(2(9) + 2 - 11 - 2 - 1)}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\nThis indicates three degrees of unsaturation, likely corresponding to a benzene ring (3 degrees) and possibly an additional double bond or ring.\n\n---\n\n### IR Data\n- **3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9**: Broad bands suggest N-H stretching, likely from an amine or amide group.\n- **1720 cm\u207b\u00b9**: Strong band indicative of a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide.\n\n---\n\n### \u00b9H NMR Data\n1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet for a CH2CH3 group, likely part of an ethyl group.\n2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: Broad singlet for 2H, likely an NH2 group or an oxygenated CH2.\n3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: Quartet for 2H, likely an oxygenated CH2 group.\n4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Options\n#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**\n- Structure: Benzamide (PhCONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3.\n- The aromatic protons would split into two doublets due to para substitution, which matches the NMR data.\n- The ethoxy group would produce a triplet at 1.2 ppm and a quartet at 4.0 ppm, consistent with the NMR data.\n- However, the NH2 group of the benzamide would typically appear around 8 ppm, not 4.0 ppm.

This makes this option incorrect.\n\n#### **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\n- Structure: A benzene ring with an NH2 group at position 4 and an ethyl ester group (COOCH2CH3) at position 1.\n- The aromatic protons would split into two doublets due to para substitution, matching the NMR data.\n- The ethyl ester group would produce a triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH2CH3) and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2), consistent with the NMR data.\n- The NH2 group would appear as a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, matching the NMR data.\n- The molecular formula **C9H11NO2** is consistent with this structure.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe spectroscopic data and molecular formula match **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. \n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is. So, I need to identify the compound C9H11NO2 based on the given IR and 1H NMR data.\n\nFirst, let's look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Hmm, the degree of unsaturation can help me figure out the structure. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, I think the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, no, I think it's (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Let me plug in the numbers: C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2 (but O doesn't affect it). So, (2*9 +2 -11 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2? Wait, wait, let me recalculate. 2C is 18, +2 is 20. Minus H (11) gives 9, plus N (1) gives 10. So 10/2 is 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That means five rings, double bonds, or triple bonds. Since we're dealing with an organic compound, likely a benzene ring (which is 4 degrees: 3 double bonds in a ring) and then one more double bond or ring. But wait, wait. Benzene is 4, so if the formula has 5, that leaves one more. So maybe another double bond, like in an amide group or ester.\n\nLooking at the IR data: strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, possible functional groups are amide, ester, ketone, maybe a carboxylic acid (but their O-H would show up too). But wait, the IR also has medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325. Those are O-H or N-H stretches. Wait, but the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid is usually broader and around 2500-3300. If it's an amide, the N-H stretch is around 3300-3500, and they are usually two peaks for the two N-H in a secondary amide. But the given IR has two bands at 3420 and 3325, which are in the range for N-H or O-H. But the compound doesn't have a carboxylic acid, since the O is in the ester or amide. Wait, looking at the options: A is benzamide, which is an amide. B is formamide, so another amide. C is a propionate, which is an ester. D is an ethyl ester as well. Hmm.\n\nSo, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong band. For an ester, the carbonyl is around 1740-1710. For an amide, the carbonyl is a bit lower, around 1680-1700. So 1720 is more ester-like. So maybe the compound is an ester, which points towards options C or D.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If it's an amide, the carbonyl would be lower. 1720 is higher, so more likely an ester. So that suggests that the compound is an ester. So options C or D.\n\nNow, looking at the NMR data. Let's list the peaks:\n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H) \u2192 this is a triplet, probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something deshielded. The triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons, so maybe the ethyl is attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen in an ester.\n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) \u2192 broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an amide proton. Or maybe an N-attached group. Or perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, but in an ester, the oxygen is usually attached to a CH2.\n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H) \u2192 quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with a neighboring group with two protons. So perhaps this is an OCH2 group. Wait, in an ester, the structure is O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So the ethyl group would be OCH2CH3. So, in the NMR, the OCH2 would be a quartet because it's next to a CH3. Wait, the ethyl ester's CH2 is usually around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet, and the CH3 is around 1.2-1.4 as a triplet. So, that fits with the 1.20 (t) and 4.5 (q) in the data. Hmm, but wait, the 4.5 is quartet, and 1.2 is triplet. So that would suggest the ethyl is attached to the oxygen. So maybe the ester group is OCH2CH3.\n\nBut wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Could that be something else, like an amide NH group? But amide protons are usually broad, but they are singlets if they are not split. But in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet, 2H. Wait, but in an amide, you'd have two protons (like in a secondary amide), which would be a singlet. But wait, in the IR, the 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are N-H stretches for an amide, perhaps. So if the compound has an amide group, then the IR would show N-H stretches, and the NMR would show the amide protons.\n\nWait, but if the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H, that could be an amide NH2 group. Wait, but the options:\n\nOption D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure would be OEt-CO-NH2 attached to a benzene ring. So the NH2 would have protons that are broad, perhaps. But wait, in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, 2H. But an NH2 group would have two protons, but as a broad peak. But in the NMR, that's a singlet, 2H. Wait, but in a secondary amide, you have two protons that are equivalent, so it would be a singlet. So for example, in benzamide, the NH2 is a singlet, but in the NMR, it's usually a broad peak.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have a structure like OEt-CO-NH2 attached to the benzene. So the NH2 group would be on the carbonyl. So the NH2 protons would be expected to show up as a broad peak, but perhaps as a singlet. So that could match the 4.0 ppm peak.\n\nBut wait, the 4.0 is a broad singlet of 2H. So that's two protons. If that's the amide NH2 group, then the other NMR peaks would be the ethyl ester and the aromatic protons.\n\nLooking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene. Because the two doublets each have 2H, suggesting two sets of two equivalent protons. So the substituent is in the para position. So the benzene ring has a substituent at para, which is attached to the carbonyl group.\n\nSo putting it together: the molecule is an ester with an amide group. Wait, no, because D is an ester. Wait, D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, so the structure is OEt-CO-NH2 attached to benzene. So the benzene is para-substituted with the ester group.\n\nWait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check the options:\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The formula would be C8H7NO3? Wait, no, wait. Let me count. Benzoate is C7H5O2-. Ethyl ester would add C2H5, so the whole molecule is C9H10O3N? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute:\n\nBenzoic acid is C7H6O2. Replacing the -OH with an ethyl ester would give C7H5O2 + C2H5O, but wait, the ester is O-CO-O-R. So, the formula for ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. Then, if it's 4-aminobenzoate, the formula would be C9H11NO2, because the amino group adds a NH2 (so one N, two H, and zero O, but the formula of the compound is C9H11NO2. Wait, benzoate ester is C7H5O2, ethyl ester adds C2H5, so C9H10O2. Then, adding NH2 would give C9H11NO2. So that fits.\n\nSo for option D, the formula is correct.\n\nNow, looking at the NMR:\n\nThe ethyl ester group: the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 at around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet, and the CH3 as a triplet at around 1.2-1.4. So the 1.20 (t) and 4.5 (q) fit the ethyl group.\n\nThe 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) would be the NH2 group. But wait, in the NMR, the NH2 protons are usually broad. So the 4.0 could be the NH2 as a broad singlet.\n\nThe aromatic region: 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). Since the substituent is para, the coupling is between the two sets of protons. So the substituent is electron-withdrawing, which would deshield the protons. The higher ppm (8.0) suggests more deshielded. So the substituent is probably a nitro group or an ester or amide group.\n\nWait, in the structure of D, the substituent is the ester group (OEt-CO-NH2). So the substituent is a carbamate group? Wait, no. The substituent is the ester, which is OEt attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to the amino group. So the substituent is OEt-CO-NH2. So the ring has an OEt-CO-NH2 group in the para position.\n\nThe aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So the substituent is para, causing the aromatic protons to split into two doublets. The protons ortho to the substituent would be at 7.0 and the meta at 8.0, but wait, no, for para substitution, each pair would be equivalent. Wait, in para substitution, the two protons on each side are equivalent, so they'd each show up as a doublet. The substituent is in the para position, so the two ortho protons would be one doublet, and the two meta would be another, but wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the two ortho are equivalent, and the two meta are equivalent. So for each, you have two protons, so each as a doublet. So the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm make sense.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene ring with OEt-CO-NH2 at para position.\n\nSo the NMR should have:\n\n- Ethyl group: 1.20 (t,3H), 4.5 (q,2H)\n- NH2: 4.0 (bs,2H)\n- Aromatic: 7.0 (d, 2H), 8.0 (d,2H)\n\nThat matches.\n\nNow, looking at the other options:\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. So the substituent is ethoxy and amide in meta positions. But the NMR aromatic would be more complex, maybe with more peaks. Also, the ethoxy group would be as OCH2CH3, but the ester group isn't present. Wait, benzamide would have a CONH2 group. The IR would have a carbonyl around 1680, which is lower than 1720, so maybe not.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is formamide attached to 4-ethoxy phenyl. So the substituents are ethoxy and formamide on the benzene. The ethoxy would be OCH2CH3, which would be around 4.0-4.2 as a quartet and 1.2 as triplet. But the formamide group would have a CONH2. The IR would have a carbonyl around 1680, which is lower than 1720. So the strong band at 1720 suggests ester, not amide. So this might not fit.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So it's a propionate ester, OCH2CH2COO- attached to 4-aminophenyl. Wait, propionate ester would have a longer chain. The NMR would have the propyl group, but the given NMR has 1.20 (t,3H) which is ethyl, not propyl. So the ethyl suggests that the ester is ethyl, not propyl. So option C is a propionate, so the ethyl in the NMR doesn't fit. So C is probably not the answer.\n\nSo based on the IR and NMR data, option D seems correct.\n",

Hmm, the degree of unsaturation can help me figure out the structure. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, I think the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, no, I think it's (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Let me plug in the numbers: C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2 (but O doesn't affect it). So, (2*9 +2 -11 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2? Wait, wait, let me recalculate. 2C is 18, +2 is 20. Minus H (11) gives 9, plus N (1) gives 10. So 10/2 is 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That means five rings, double bonds, or triple bonds. Since we're dealing with an organic compound, likely a benzene ring (which is 4 degrees: 3 double bonds in a ring) and then one more double bond or ring. But wait, wait. Benzene is 4, so if the formula has 5, that leaves one more. So maybe another double bond, like in an amide group or ester.\n\nLooking at the IR data: strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, possible functional groups are amide, ester, ketone, maybe a carboxylic acid (but their O-H would show up too). But wait, the IR also has medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325. Those are O-H or N-H stretches. Wait, but the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid is usually broader and around 2500-3300. If it's an amide, the N-H stretch is around 3300-3500, and they are usually two peaks for the two N-H in a secondary amide. But the given IR has two bands at 3420 and 3325, which are in the range for N-H or O-H. But the compound doesn't have a carboxylic acid, since the O is in the ester or amide. Wait, looking at the options: A is benzamide, which is an amide. B is formamide, so another amide. C is a propionate, which is an ester. D is an ethyl ester as well. Hmm.\n\nSo, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong band. For an ester, the carbonyl is around 1740-1710. For an amide, the carbonyl is a bit lower, around 1680-1700. So 1720 is more ester-like. So maybe the compound is an ester, which points towards options C or D.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If it's an amide, the carbonyl would be lower. 1720 is higher, so more likely an ester. So that suggests that the compound is an ester. So options C or D.\n\nNow, looking at the NMR data. Let's list the peaks:\n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H) \u2192 this is a triplet, probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something deshielded. The triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons, so maybe the ethyl is attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen in an ester.\n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) \u2192 broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an amide proton. Or maybe an N-attached group. Or perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, but in an ester, the oxygen is usually attached to a CH2.\n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H) \u2192 quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with a neighboring group with two protons. So perhaps this is an OCH2 group. Wait, in an ester, the structure is O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So the ethyl group would be OCH2CH3. So, in the NMR, the OCH2 would be a quartet because it's next to a CH3. Wait, the ethyl ester's CH2 is usually around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet, and the CH3 is around 1.2-1.4 as a triplet. So, that fits with the 1.20 (t) and 4.5 (q) in the data. Hmm, but wait, the 4.5 is quartet, and 1.2 is triplet. So that would suggest the ethyl is attached to the oxygen. So maybe the ester group is OCH2CH3.\n\nBut wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Could that be something else, like an amide NH group? But amide protons are usually broad, but they are singlets if they are not split. But in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet, 2H. Wait, but in an amide, you'd have two protons (like in a secondary amide), which would be a singlet. But wait, in the IR, the 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are N-H stretches for an amide, perhaps. So if the compound has an amide group, then the IR would show N-H stretches, and the NMR would show the amide protons.\n\nWait, but if the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H, that could be an amide NH2 group. Wait, but the options:\n\nOption D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure would be OEt-CO-NH2 attached to a benzene ring. So the NH2 would have protons that are broad, perhaps. But wait, in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, 2H. But an NH2 group would have two protons, but as a broad peak. But in the NMR, that's a singlet, 2H. Wait, but in a secondary amide, you have two protons that are equivalent, so it would be a singlet. So for example, in benzamide, the NH2 is a singlet, but in the NMR, it's usually a broad peak.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have a structure like OEt-CO-NH2 attached to the benzene. So the NH2 group would be on the carbonyl. So the NH2 protons would be expected to show up as a broad peak, but perhaps as a singlet. So that could match the 4.0 ppm peak.\n\nBut wait, the 4.0 is a broad singlet of 2H. So that's two protons. If that's the amide NH2 group, then the other NMR peaks would be the ethyl ester and the aromatic protons.\n\nLooking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene. Because the two doublets each have 2H, suggesting two sets of two equivalent protons. So the substituent is in the para position. So the benzene ring has a substituent at para, which is attached to the carbonyl group.\n\nSo putting it together: the molecule is an ester with an amide group. Wait, no, because D is an ester. Wait, D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, so the structure is OEt-CO-NH2 attached to benzene. So the benzene is para-substituted with the ester group.\n\nWait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check the options:\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The formula would be C8H7NO3? Wait, no, wait. Let me count. Benzoate is C7H5O2-. Ethyl ester would add C2H5, so the whole molecule is C9H10O3N? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute:\n\nBenzoic acid is C7H6O2. Replacing the -OH with an ethyl ester would give C7H5O2 + C2H5O, but wait, the ester is O-CO-O-R. So, the formula for ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. Then, if it's 4-aminobenzoate, the formula would be C9H11NO2, because the amino group adds a NH2 (so one N, two H, and zero O, but the formula of the compound is C9H11NO2. Wait, benzoate ester is C7H5O2, ethyl ester adds C2H5, so C9H10O2. Then, adding NH2 would give C9H11NO2. So that fits.\n\nSo for option D, the formula is correct.\n\nNow, looking at the NMR:\n\nThe ethyl ester group: the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 at around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet, and the CH3 as a triplet at around 1.2-1.4. So the 1.20 (t) and 4.5 (q) fit the ethyl group.\n\nThe 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) would be the NH2 group. But wait, in the NMR, the NH2 protons are usually broad. So the 4.0 could be the NH2 as a broad singlet.\n\nThe aromatic region: 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). Since the substituent is para, the coupling is between the two sets of protons. So the substituent is electron-withdrawing, which would deshield the protons. The higher ppm (8.0) suggests more deshielded. So the substituent is probably a nitro group or an ester or amide group.\n\nWait, in the structure of D, the substituent is the ester group (OEt-CO-NH2). So the substituent is a carbamate group? Wait, no. The substituent is the ester, which is OEt attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to the amino group. So the substituent is OEt-CO-NH2. So the ring has an OEt-CO-NH2 group in the para position.\n\nThe aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So the substituent is para, causing the aromatic protons to split into two doublets. The protons ortho to the substituent would be at 7.0 and the meta at 8.0, but wait, no, for para substitution, each pair would be equivalent. Wait, in para substitution, the two protons on each side are equivalent, so they'd each show up as a doublet. The substituent is in the para position, so the two ortho protons would be one doublet, and the two meta would be another, but wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the two ortho are equivalent, and the two meta are equivalent. So for each, you have two protons, so each as a doublet. So the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm make sense.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene ring with OEt-CO-NH2 at para position.\n\nSo the NMR should have:\n\n- Ethyl group: 1.20 (t,3H), 4.5 (q,2H)\n- NH2: 4.0 (bs,2H)\n- Aromatic: 7.0 (d, 2H), 8.0 (d,2H)\n\nThat matches.\n\nNow, looking at the other options:\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. So the substituent is ethoxy and amide in meta positions. But the NMR aromatic would be more complex, maybe with more peaks. Also, the ethoxy group would be as OCH2CH3, but the ester group isn't present. Wait, benzamide would have a CONH2 group. The IR would have a carbonyl around 1680, which is lower than 1720, so maybe not.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is formamide attached to 4-ethoxy phenyl. So the substituents are ethoxy and formamide on the benzene. The ethoxy would be OCH2CH3, which would be around 4.0-4.2 as a quartet and 1.2 as triplet. But the formamide group would have a CONH2. The IR would have a carbonyl around 1680, which is lower than 1720. So the strong band at 1720 suggests ester, not amide. So this might not fit.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So it's a propionate ester, OCH2CH2COO- attached to 4-aminophenyl. Wait, propionate ester would have a longer chain. The NMR would have the propyl group, but the given NMR has 1.20 (t,3H) which is ethyl, not propyl. So the ethyl suggests that the ester is ethyl, not propyl. So option C is a propionate, so the ethyl in the NMR doesn't fit. So C is probably not the answer.\n\nSo based on the IR and NMR data, option D seems correct.\n\n\nTo identify the compound C9H11NO2, we analyze the given IR and 1H NMR data alongside the molecular formula and options provided.\n\n### Molecular Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation\nThe molecular formula C9H11NO2 corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 5, indicating the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional unsaturation, likely from a carbonyl group.\n\n### IR Analysis\n- **Strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9**: This is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), specifically an ester, as amides typically show lower carbonyl stretches (~1680-1700 cm\u207b\u00b9).\n- **Medium to strong bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9**: These are consistent with N-H stretches, suggesting the presence of an amide group.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis\n1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating for 3H, characteristic of a CH3 group in an ethyl group (CH2CH3).\n2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating for 2H, likely corresponding to the NH2 group of an amide.\n3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating for 2H, characteristic of a CH2 group in an ethyl ester (OCH2CH3).\n4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating for 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### Option Analysis\n1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  \n   - Contains an ethoxy group and an amide group.  \n   - The ethoxy group would produce signals similar to the NMR data, but the carbonyl stretch for an amide (~1680-1700 cm\u207b\u00b9) does not match the strong IR band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9.  \n   - **Eliminated**.\n\n2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  \n   - Contains an ethoxy group and a formamide group.  \n   - The ethoxy group would produce signals similar to the NMR data, but the carbonyl stretch for a formamide (~1680 cm\u207b\u00b9) does not match the strong IR band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9.  \n   - **Eliminated**.\n\n3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  \n   - Contains a propionate ester and an amine group.  \n   - The NMR data includes a triplet at 1.20 ppm and a quartet at 4.5 ppm, consistent with an ethyl group, not a propyl group.  \n   - **Eliminated**.\n\n4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  \n   - Contains an ethyl ester, an amide group, and a para-substituted benzene ring.  \n   - The IR band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 matches the ester carbonyl, and the NMR data aligns with the ethyl ester (1.20 ppm, 4.5 ppm), the amide NH2 group (4.0 ppm), and the para-substituted aromatic protons (7.0 ppm, 8.0 ppm).  \n   - **Correct**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, as it satisfies both the IR and NMR data, as well as the molecular formula.\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's break down the given data and think through the possible options.\n\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation first. For C9H11NO2, the formula is CnHmOxNp. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2n +2 - m - x - p)/2. So, n=9, m=11, O=2, N=1. Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2=6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could be three rings, but more likely a combination, like one ring and two double bonds, or three double bonds, but probably one ring (like benzene) and one double bond, plus maybe a triple bond or something else. Wait, benzene has three DoU on its own. Oh wait, no, benzene has three double bonds, so that's three DoU. So a benzene ring plus maybe an amide group or something else with a double bond. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad peaks, probably N-H stretches. The medium to strong intensity suggests either amine or amide. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the compound likely has a carbonyl group. So possible functional groups could be amides, esters, or maybe ketones. But given the N-H stretches, perhaps an amide or urea? But the options include things like benzamide, formamide, propionate (which is ester), and ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nLooking at the 1H NMR:\n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, probably a CH2CH3 group. Like an ethyl group attached to something deshielded or adjacent to an electronegative atom. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2.\n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for two protons. Could be adjacent to an amide group or something with hydrogen bonding. Or maybe an OCH2 group, but the broadness suggests possible exchange or hydrogen bonding. Another thought: maybe it's a NH2 group, but that's usually a broad peak, but in this case, it's 2H. Or perhaps an OCH2, like an ethyl ester where the O is attached to CH2, but that's usually a triplet or quartet. Hmm.\n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests splitting into four peaks, which usually comes from coupling with two neighboring protons. Like CH2 next to another CH2. Maybe a -OCH2CH2- group? Or perhaps a carbonyl adjacent to CH2, like in an ester. Wait, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have triplet at around 1.2 and quartet at 4.1. But here it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen.\n\n7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): These are aromatic protons. The doublets suggest coupling with one neighboring proton each. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene. The lower ppm (7.0) might be ortho to an electron-withdrawing group, and the higher (8.0) could be the more deshielded protons. Alternatively, the 8.0 ppm could be adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl.\n\nPutting this together: the aromatic protons are in a para-substituted pattern. So substituents on the benzene ring are at para positions. Looking at the options, let's see.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. So benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene, and ethoxy at position 3. Wait, that would make the substituents at positions 3 and maybe another. But in the NMR, the aromatic is two doublets, which suggests two substituents in para positions. Because if substituent is at para, you have two sets of doublets. So if it's 3-ethoxybenzamide, the substituents would be ethoxy at 3 and amide at 1? Wait, benzamide is at position 1, and ethoxy at 3? So the substituents would be meta, not para. So the aromatic protons would be more complex, maybe a triplet or something else. So maybe option A is less likely.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a phenyl ring where the substituent is ethoxy at the para position. So the benzene has ethoxy at position 4 and the formamide group at position 1. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the NMR. Because when substituents are para, the aromatic protons split into two doublets. So for the benzene ring, if substituent is at 4 (para), then the protons ortho to substituent would be at 7.0 and 8.0? Hmm, but the substituent is ethoxy, which is activating and ortho/para directing. So the formamide is at position 1, and ethoxy at 4. So the protons adjacent to the formamide would be at higher ppm (like around 8.0), and the ones adjacent to ethoxy would be lower (like 7.0). That fits with the NMR.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is propionyl (CH2CH2COO-) attached to a benzene ring with an amino group at position 4. So the benzene has NH2 at 4 and the propionate at 1. The propionate would be O=C-O-CH2CH2-CH3. Wait, but wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: the phenyl group is C6H5, the propionate is C3H5O2 (since it's CH2CH2COO-), plus the NH2? Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C6H5NHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Or wait, the structure is more accurately the benzamide: perhaps it's CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-4. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: the formula for option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. So that would be O=C-O-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring at the 4 position, but also an amino group at 4? No, that can't be, because the substituents would be at the same position. Wait, no. The propionate is the ester group. So it's the phenyl group with an amino group at 4 and the propionate ester at another position, maybe the 1 position. So the structure would be O=C-O-CH2CH2CH2 attached to the benzene ring, and the amino group at the para position. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches the NMR. But then the amino group would have protons. Wait, the IR has N-H stretches, so that would fit. Let's think about the NMR. The amino group is NH2, which in the NMR would show up as a broad peak. But in the given data, the 1H NMR doesn't show anything around 2-3 ppm for NH2. Hmm. Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe it's the OCH2 group, but I'm not sure. Let me think more.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzoate ester with ethyl group and an amino group at the para position. So the structure is O=C-OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring, and an amino group at position 4. Wait, but that would make the substituents at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (amino), which are meta to each other. So the aromatic protons would be three sets: perhaps two doublets and a singlet or something else. Wait, but in the NMR, there are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests that the substituents are para to each other, so the protons are split into two doublets each. So if the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, that wouldn't give two doublets. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring, which are para positions, that would give two doublets in the NMR. Because each substituent would have two adjacent protons. For example, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, so the adjacent protons are each in a pair. So the protons ortho to substituent A would be a doublet, and the protons ortho to substituent B would be another doublet. So that fits the NMR data.\n\nLooking at the IR: the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, which is present in all options except maybe A. Wait, option A is benzamide, which has a carbonyl. Option B is formamide, which has a carbonyl. Option C is a propionate, which is an ester, so carbonyl. Option D is an ester, so same.\n\nThe IR also shows N-H stretches. Amides have N-H stretches around 3300-3500 cm-1, which is what we have here. So looking at the options:\n\nOption A: Benzamide has an amide group, so IR shows N-H.\n\nOption B: Formamide, same.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate has an amine group (NH2), which would show broad N-H stretches. But wait, in the IR, the N-H is present, so that's compatible.\n\nOption D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. This compound has an amino group (NH2) and an ester (benzoate). So the IR would show N-H stretches for the amine, which is what we have.\n\nSo the IR supports all options except perhaps C, which has an amine. Wait, no, C has an amine, so that's fine.\n\nLooking at the NMR shifts. Let's go through each option.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O=C-O-CH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 group at position 4. So the substituents are at 1 (ester) and 4 (amino), which are para. So the aromatic protons would be ortho to each substituent. Let's think about their chemical shifts. The protons ortho to the ester group (which is an electron-withdrawing group) would be deshielded, so appear downfield. The protons ortho to the amino group (electron-donating) would be less deshielded, so appear upfield. So in the NMR, we'd expect a doublet at around 8.0 ppm (from the ester-adjacent protons) and another doublet at around 7.0 ppm (from the amino-adjacent protons). That matches the given data. \n\nNow, looking at the other signals in NMR. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) would be the OCH2 in the ester. The ethyl group in the ester typically has a triplet for the CH3 (at ~1.2 ppm) and a quartet for the OCH2 (at ~4.1-4.3 ppm). But in this case, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher than usual. Could that be due to the amino group's effect? Or perhaps it's an exchange with the amino group's protons? Alternatively, maybe the ester is adjacent to an amino group, causing some deshielding.\n\nThe broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is a bit confusing. Wait, in option D, the amino group is NH2, which would show up as a broad peak, but it's usually around 1-5 ppm, but more like 2-3 ppm for NH2. However, in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. Hmm, maybe it's not the amino group. Alternatively, perhaps it's the ethyl group's OCH2. But that's usually a quartet. Wait, but wait, maybe the amino group is exchanging and not showing up as a peak, or perhaps it's a broad peak that's overlapping with another signal. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different group.\n\nWait, the NMR shows:\n\n- 1.20 ppm, triplet (3H): that's likely the CH3 of an ethyl group, like OCH2CH3. So the ethyl ester is present.\n\n- 4.5 ppm, quartet (2H): OCH2 of the ethyl ester.\n\n- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H): could this be the NH2 group? Wait, but NH2 is usually a broad peak, but integrating 2H. But in this case, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which doesn't match the expected splitting for NH2. Because in an NH2 group, the protons are usually not split (singlet) but might be broad. Wait, but in the case of an amine adjacent to an electronegative group, perhaps the NH2 is exchanging and appears as a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group, but that's usually a quartet.\n\nWait, another possibility: in option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is O=C-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 at position 4. So the ethyl ester would give triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. Then what's the 4.0 ppm singlet? Maybe it's not from the ester but from something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 group. But in that case, the NH2 would typically appear as a broad peak around 1-5 ppm, but integrating for two protons. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. Hmm, that doesn't fit because NH2 protons usually don't form singlets unless they're in a very symmetric environment, which I don't think is the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's an N-attached group. Let me think again.\n\nWait, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a benzene ring which has an ethoxy group at the para position. So the substituents are at positions 1 (formamide) and 4 (ethoxy). The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches. The ethoxy group would give a triplet at around 1.2 ppm (CH3O) and a quartet at around 4.0 ppm (OCH2). But in the NMR, the triplet is at 1.20, and the quartet is at 4.5. Wait, the ethoxy's OCH2 is usually around 4.0-4.2 as a quartet. So here, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit high. Hmm. Also, the formamide would have an NH group, which would show as a broad peak. Let's see, the formamide has a CONH2 group? No, wait, formamide is HCONH2. So the NH2 would have N-H stretches in the IR, which we have. In the NMR, the NH2 protons would be a broad peak, but in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. That doesn't fit because NH2 would be a broad peak, maybe around 2-5 ppm, but integrating for two H. Alternatively, maybe the NH is a singlet? Wait, formamide's NH is a singlet, but in the NMR, it's a broad peak. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 group.\n\nBut wait, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. So perhaps in this case, the NH2 is not exchanging quickly enough and appears as a singlet. That's possible but less common. Also, the quartet at 4.5 ppm would be from where? In option B, the ethoxy group's OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0. But in the NMR, it's at 4.5. Hmm, so that doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is O=C-O-CH2CH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 at position 4. So the ester group would have OCH2CH2CH3. The ethyl part would be a triplet at around 1.0-1.5 ppm and a quartet at around 4.0-4.3 ppm. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher. Maybe the propionate's OCH2 is split into a quartet but shifted downfield due to the ester group's electron-withdrawing effect. Also, the NH2 group would be present. So the NMR would show a triplet at 1.20, quartet at 4.5, and the NH2 as a broad peak. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. Hmm, doesn't fit.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) attached to benzene, and ethoxy at position 3. The aromatic protons would be more complex, perhaps a triplet or a doublet of doublets. But the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests substituents at para positions. So this option might not fit. Also, the ethoxy group would have a triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.0, but the quartet in the NMR is at 4.5. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the integration. The 1H NMR has:\n\n- 1.20 (t,3H)\n- 4.0 (bs,2H)\n- 4.5 (q,2H)\n- 7.0 (d,2H)\n- 8.0 (d,2H)\n\nThe integrals add up to 3+2+2+2+2=11 H. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2, so 11 H in total. So the integrations match.\n\nSo the quartet at 4.5 (2H) is likely OCH2 from an ester. The triplet at 1.2 (3H) is the CH3 of an ethyl group attached to O.\n\nSo looking for an ethyl ester group. So options with ethyl ester would be D and maybe others.\n\nOption D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the ethyl ester would give the triplet and quartet. The quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit high but possible. The NH2 would give a broad peak, but where? In the given NMR, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which is 2H. So that doesn't fit the NH2, which would be more like a singlet but maybe integrating for 2H. Wait, but the NH2 would have two protons, so a singlet integrating for 2H. So 4.0 ppm could be the NH2. But I thought the NH2 is usually around 1-5 ppm, but more like 2-3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the OCH2 in the ester, but that's usually a quartet. Wait, maybe it's a different group. Let me think again.\n\nLooking back, in the NMR:\n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H): likely the OCH2 of the ethyl ester.\n\n1.20 ppm (t,3H): the CH3 of ethyl ester.\n\n4.0 ppm (bs,2H): what else could this be? Maybe a methylene adjacent to an amide group. Or perhaps a CH2 connected to an amine.\n\nWait, let's consider option B again. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure is HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3-C6H4). So the ethoxy group would have triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.0. The formamide's NH would be a broad peak. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which doesn't match. So that's a problem.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The propionate ester would have OCH2CH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1-4.3, but in the NMR it's at 4.5, which is higher. So that's a mismatch. Also, the NH2 would be a broad peak, but in the given data, the 4.0 is a singlet of 2H. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ethyl ester would give triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. The NH2 would be a broad peak. But in the given data, the 4.0 is a singlet of 2H. So perhaps that's the NH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 adjacent to something else. Let me think about the structures again.\n\nIn option D, the structure is O=C-O-CH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 at position 4. So the ethyl ester gives triplet and quartet. The NH2 would be a broad peak, perhaps integrating for 2H. But in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet, which doesn't fit. So maybe option D is not correct.\n\nWait, but let's think about the 4.0 ppm. Could it be a CH2 connected to an amine? Like in the case of an amide. Let's look at option B again. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure is HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3-C6H4). The formamide's NH would be a broad peak, perhaps around 4.0. But it's usually a triplet? Or a singlet? Formamide's NH is typically a singlet because the two H are equivalent. So the 4.0 ppm could be the NH of the formamide. But in that case, the NH would be a singlet, which matches the data. But then, what about the ethoxy group's OCH2? It should be a quartet around 4.0, but in the data it's at 4.5. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 of option D. Wait, but the NH2 is usually a broad peak, and the singlet would integrate for 2H. So perhaps it's the NH2. But why is it at 4.0 ppm? Maybe because it's adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, causing deshielding.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the NMR shifts for the aromatic protons. The downfield shift at 8.0 ppm suggests strong deshielding, which is typical of protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl (ester) or amide. So in option D, the substituents are ester (at 1) and amino (at 4). The protons ortho to the ester would be at higher ppm (8.0), and those ortho to the amino would be at lower (7.0). So that matches the NMR.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nThe triplet at 1.2 is the ethyl ester's CH3.\n\nThe quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2 of the ethyl ester.\n\nThe singlet at 4.0 is the NH2 group. But wait, NH2 usually shows up as a broad peak, but in this case, it's a singlet. Could it be that the NH2 is exchanging and appears as a singlet? Or maybe the NH2 is in a different environment. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not the NH2 but another group.\n\nWait, another thought: in the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is at position 4, and the ester is at position 1. The ester's OCH2 would be at 4.5 as a quartet, and the ethyl's CH3 at 1.2 as triplet. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches. The NH2 would be a broad peak, perhaps integrating for 2H. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. Hmm.\n\nWait, another possibility: the 4.0 ppm is the NH group of an amide. Let's look at option A and B.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with ethoxy at position 3. So the NH2 would be a broad peak. The ethoxy's OCH2 would be a quartet at 4.0. So in the NMR, the quartet would be at 4.0, but in the data, the quartet is at 4.5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide's NH would be a singlet, perhaps at around 4.0. The ethoxy's OCH2 would be at 4.0 as a quartet. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of each option's expected NMR.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nNMR would have:\n\n- 1.20, triplet (CH3OCH2)\n- 4.5, quartet (OCH2)\n- Aromatic protons: 7.0 (d,2H) and 8.0 (d,2H)\n- NH2: broad peak, but where? Maybe at 4.0 as a singlet. But in the data, it's a singlet of 2H at 4.0.\n\nSo perhaps the NH2 is the 4.0 singlet. That could be possible if the NH2 is exchanging and appears as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not showing up as a separate peak because it's in fast exchange and integrated into the aromatic region. But that's less likely.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from another group. Wait, maybe the structure isn't an ester but an amide. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: benzamide with ethoxy. The amide's NH2 would be a broad peak. The ethoxy's OCH2 would be a quartet at 4.0, but in the data, it's at 4.5. So doesn't fit.\n\nOption B: formamide. The formamide's NH would be a singlet. The ethoxy's OCH2 would be a quartet at 4.0, but data has quartet at 4.5.\n\nOption C: propionate ester. OCH2CH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1-4.3, but data has 4.5. So mismatch.\n\nOption D: OCH2CH3 (ester) would have quartet at 4.5, which matches. The NH2 would be a broad peak, but in data, it's a singlet at 4.0. Maybe it's the NH2.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the integration. The NMR shows 4.0 as 2H. If that's the NH2, that makes sense. So the quartet at 4.5 (2H) is OCH2, triplet at 1.2 (3H) is CH3. The aromatic protons are two doublets.\n\nSo in option D, the NH2 would appear as a broad peak. But in the data, the 4.0 is a singlet, which is unusual for NH2. But perhaps in this case, the NH2 is in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 is not the NH2 but another group.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the structure is N-ethyl something. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 3-ethoxybenzamide: structure is CONH2 with OCH2CH3 at 3.\n\nB) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: HCONH- attached to 4-OCH2CH3.\n\nC) 4-aminophenyl propionate: O=C-O-CH2CH2CH3 attached to benzene with NH2 at 4.\n\nD) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: O=C-O-CH2CH3 attached to benzene with NH2 at 4.\n\nSo option C has a propionate ester, which would have a longer chain. The OCH2CH2 would be in the NMR as a quartet at around 4.1 and a triplet at 1.6, but the data shows a quartet at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2, which suggests an ethyl group, not propyl.\n\nSo option C is less likely because the NMR suggests ethyl, not propyl.\n\nSo, among the options, D and B have ethyl groups.\n\nOption B's ethoxy group would give OCH2CH3 as triplet and quartet, but the quartet in the NMR is at 4.5, which is higher than usual.\n\nOption D's ethyl ester would have the quartet at 4.5, which matches. The triplet at 1.2 matches. The aromatic protons match. The 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which could be the NH2.\n\nSo putting it all together, the correct answer is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe compound C9H11NO2 is identified based on the provided IR and 1H NMR data. The molecular formula indicates a degree of unsaturation of 3, suggesting the presence of a benzene ring (3 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or functional group. The IR spectrum shows strong N-H stretches at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9, consistent with an amine or amide, and a strong carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group.\n\nThe 1H NMR data includes:\n- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, characteristic of a CH3 group in an ethyl group.\n- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, likely from an NH2 group or a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom.\n- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet, consistent with an OCH2 group in an ethyl ester.\n- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  \n   This compound has a benzamide group (CONH2) and an ethoxy group at position 3. The aromatic protons would not produce two simple doublets due to the meta substitution pattern. Additionally, the ethoxy group's OCH2 would appear as a quartet around 4.0 ppm, but the data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm. This mismatch eliminates this option.\n\n2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  \n   This compound has a formamide group (HCONH-) and an ethoxy group at the para position. The aromatic protons would produce two doublets, consistent with the NMR data. However, the ethoxy group's OCH2 would appear as a quartet around 4.0 ppm, while the data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm. This mismatch eliminates this option.\n\n3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  \n   This compound has a propionate ester (O=C-O-CH2CH2CH3) and an amino group at position 4. The NMR data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is consistent with an OCH2 group. However, the propionate ester would also produce a triplet for the CH2 group, which is not observed in the data. Additionally, the NH2 group would typically appear as a broad peak, but the data shows a singlet at 4.0 ppm. This mismatch eliminates this option.\n\n4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  \n   This compound has an ethyl ester (O=C-O-CH2CH3) and an amino group at position 4. The ethyl ester produces a triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH3) and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2), both of which match the NMR data. The aromatic protons produce two doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm, consistent with a para-substituted benzene. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm can be attributed to the NH2 group, which is plausible in this environment. This option matches all the data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.  \nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's break down the given data and think through the possible options.\n\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation first. For C9H11NO2, the formula is CnHmOxNp. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2n +2 - m - x - p)/2. So, n=9, m=11, O=2, N=1. Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2=6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could be three rings, but more likely a combination, like one ring and two double bonds, or three double bonds, but probably one ring (like benzene) and one double bond, plus maybe a triple bond or something else. Wait, benzene has three DoU on its own. Oh wait, no, benzene has three double bonds, so that's three DoU. So a benzene ring plus maybe an amide group or something else with a double bond. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad peaks, probably N-H stretches. The medium to strong intensity suggests either amine or amide. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the compound likely has a carbonyl group. So possible functional groups could be amides, esters, or maybe ketones. But given the N-H stretches, perhaps an amide or urea? But the options include things like benzamide, formamide, propionate (which is ester), and ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nLooking at the 1H NMR:\n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, probably a CH2CH3 group. Like an ethyl group attached to something deshielded or adjacent to an electronegative atom. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2.\n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for two protons. Could be adjacent to an amide group or something with hydrogen bonding. Or maybe an OCH2 group, but the broadness suggests possible exchange or hydrogen bonding. Another thought: maybe it's a NH2 group, but that's usually a broad peak, but in this case, it's 2H. Or perhaps an OCH2, like an ethyl ester where the O is attached to CH2, but that's usually a triplet or quartet. Hmm.\n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests splitting into four peaks, which usually comes from coupling with two neighboring protons. Like CH2 next to another CH2. Maybe a -OCH2CH2- group? Or perhaps a carbonyl adjacent to CH2, like in an ester. Wait, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have triplet at around 1.2 and quartet at 4.1. But here it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen.\n\n7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): These are aromatic protons. The doublets suggest coupling with one neighboring proton each. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene. The lower ppm (7.0) might be ortho to an electron-withdrawing group, and the higher (8.0) could be the more deshielded protons. Alternatively, the 8.0 ppm could be adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl.\n\nPutting this together: the aromatic protons are in a para-substituted pattern. So substituents on the benzene ring are at para positions. Looking at the options, let's see.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. So benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene, and ethoxy at position 3. Wait, that would make the substituents at positions 3 and maybe another. But in the NMR, the aromatic is two doublets, which suggests two substituents in para positions. Because if substituent is at para, you have two sets of doublets. So if it's 3-ethoxybenzamide, the substituents would be ethoxy at 3 and amide at 1? Wait, benzamide is at position 1, and ethoxy at 3? So the substituents would be meta, not para. So the aromatic protons would be more complex, maybe a triplet or something else. So maybe option A is less likely.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a phenyl ring where the substituent is ethoxy at the para position. So the benzene has ethoxy at position 4 and the formamide group at position 1. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the NMR. Because when substituents are para, the aromatic protons split into two doublets. So for the benzene ring, if substituent is at 4 (para), then the protons ortho to substituent would be at 7.0 and 8.0? Hmm, but the substituent is ethoxy, which is activating and ortho/para directing. So the formamide is at position 1, and ethoxy at 4. So the protons adjacent to the formamide would be at higher ppm (like around 8.0), and the ones adjacent to ethoxy would be lower (like 7.0). That fits with the NMR.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is propionyl (CH2CH2COO-) attached to a benzene ring with an amino group at position 4. So the benzene has NH2 at 4 and the propionate at 1. The propionate would be O=C-O-CH2CH2-CH3. Wait, but wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: the phenyl group is C6H5, the propionate is C3H5O2 (since it's CH2CH2COO-), plus the NH2? Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C6H5NHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Or wait, the structure is more accurately the benzamide: perhaps it's CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-4. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: the formula for option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. So that would be O=C-O-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring at the 4 position, but also an amino group at 4? No, that can't be, because the substituents would be at the same position. Wait, no. The propionate is the ester group. So it's the phenyl group with an amino group at 4 and the propionate ester at another position, maybe the 1 position. So the structure would be O=C-O-CH2CH2CH2 attached to the benzene ring, and the amino group at the para position. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches the NMR. But then the amino group would have protons. Wait, the IR has N-H stretches, so that would fit. Let's think about the NMR. The amino group is NH2, which in the NMR would show up as a broad peak. But in the given data, the 1H NMR doesn't show anything around 2-3 ppm for NH2. Hmm. Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe it's the OCH2 group, but I'm not sure. Let me think more.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzoate ester with ethyl group and an amino group at the para position. So the structure is O=C-OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring, and an amino group at position 4. Wait, but that would make the substituents at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (amino), which are meta to each other. So the aromatic protons would be three sets: perhaps two doublets and a singlet or something else. Wait, but in the NMR, there are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests that the substituents are para to each other, so the protons are split into two doublets each. So if the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, that wouldn't give two doublets. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring, which are para positions, that would give two doublets in the NMR. Because each substituent would have two adjacent protons. For example, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, so the adjacent protons are each in a pair. So the protons ortho to substituent A would be a doublet, and the protons ortho to substituent B would be another doublet. So that fits the NMR data.\n\nLooking at the IR: the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, which is present in all options except maybe A. Wait, option A is benzamide, which has a carbonyl. Option B is formamide, which has a carbonyl. Option C is a propionate, which is an ester, so carbonyl. Option D is an ester, so same.\n\nThe IR also shows N-H stretches. Amides have N-H stretches around 3300-3500 cm-1, which is what we have here. So looking at the options:\n\nOption A: Benzamide has an amide group, so IR shows N-H.\n\nOption B: Formamide, same.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate has an amine group (NH2), which would show broad N-H stretches. But wait, in the IR, the N-H is present, so that's compatible.\n\nOption D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. This compound has an amino group (NH2) and an ester (benzoate). So the IR would show N-H stretches for the amine, which is what we have.\n\nSo the IR supports all options except perhaps C, which has an amine. Wait, no, C has an amine, so that's fine.\n\nLooking at the NMR shifts. Let's go through each option.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O=C-O-CH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 group at position 4. So the substituents are at 1 (ester) and 4 (amino), which are para. So the aromatic protons would be ortho to each substituent. Let's think about their chemical shifts. The protons ortho to the ester group (which is an electron-withdrawing group) would be deshielded, so appear downfield. The protons ortho to the amino group (electron-donating) would be less deshielded, so appear upfield. So in the NMR, we'd expect a doublet at around 8.0 ppm (from the ester-adjacent protons) and another doublet at around 7.0 ppm (from the amino-adjacent protons). That matches the given data. \n\nNow, looking at the other signals in NMR. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) would be the OCH2 in the ester. The ethyl group in the ester typically has a triplet for the CH3 (at ~1.2 ppm) and a quartet for the OCH2 (at ~4.1-4.3 ppm). But in this case, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher than usual. Could that be due to the amino group's effect? Or perhaps it's an exchange with the amino group's protons? Alternatively, maybe the ester is adjacent to an amino group, causing some deshielding.\n\nThe broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is a bit confusing. Wait, in option D, the amino group is NH2, which would show up as a broad peak, but it's usually around 1-5 ppm, but more like 2-3 ppm for NH2. However, in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. Hmm, maybe it's not the amino group. Alternatively, perhaps it's the ethyl group's OCH2. But that's usually a quartet. Wait, but wait, maybe the amino group is exchanging and not showing up as a peak, or perhaps it's a broad peak that's overlapping with another signal. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different group.\n\nWait, the NMR shows:\n\n- 1.20 ppm, triplet (3H): that's likely the CH3 of an ethyl group, like OCH2CH3. So the ethyl ester is present.\n\n- 4.5 ppm, quartet (2H): OCH2 of the ethyl ester.\n\n- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H): could this be the NH2 group? Wait, but NH2 is usually a broad peak, but integrating 2H. But in this case, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which doesn't match the expected splitting for NH2. Because in an NH2 group, the protons are usually not split (singlet) but might be broad. Wait, but in the case of an amine adjacent to an electronegative group, perhaps the NH2 is exchanging and appears as a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group, but that's usually a quartet.\n\nWait, another possibility: in option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is O=C-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 at position 4. So the ethyl ester would give triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. Then what's the 4.0 ppm singlet? Maybe it's not from the ester but from something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 group. But in that case, the NH2 would typically appear as a broad peak around 1-5 ppm, but integrating for two protons. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. Hmm, that doesn't fit because NH2 protons usually don't form singlets unless they're in a very symmetric environment, which I don't think is the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's an N-attached group. Let me think again.\n\nWait, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a benzene ring which has an ethoxy group at the para position. So the substituents are at positions 1 (formamide) and 4 (ethoxy). The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches. The ethoxy group would give a triplet at around 1.2 ppm (CH3O) and a quartet at around 4.0 ppm (OCH2). But in the NMR, the triplet is at 1.20, and the quartet is at 4.5. Wait, the ethoxy's OCH2 is usually around 4.0-4.2 as a quartet. So here, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit high. Hmm. Also, the formamide would have an NH group, which would show as a broad peak. Let's see, the formamide has a CONH2 group? No, wait, formamide is HCONH2. So the NH2 would have N-H stretches in the IR, which we have. In the NMR, the NH2 protons would be a broad peak, but in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. That doesn't fit because NH2 would be a broad peak, maybe around 2-5 ppm, but integrating for two H. Alternatively, maybe the NH is a singlet? Wait, formamide's NH is a singlet, but in the NMR, it's a broad peak. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 group.\n\nBut wait, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. So perhaps in this case, the NH2 is not exchanging quickly enough and appears as a singlet. That's possible but less common. Also, the quartet at 4.5 ppm would be from where? In option B, the ethoxy group's OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0. But in the NMR, it's at 4.5. Hmm, so that doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is O=C-O-CH2CH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 at position 4. So the ester group would have OCH2CH2CH3. The ethyl part would be a triplet at around 1.0-1.5 ppm and a quartet at around 4.0-4.3 ppm. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher. Maybe the propionate's OCH2 is split into a quartet but shifted downfield due to the ester group's electron-withdrawing effect. Also, the NH2 group would be present. So the NMR would show a triplet at 1.20, quartet at 4.5, and the NH2 as a broad peak. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. Hmm, doesn't fit.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) attached to benzene, and ethoxy at position 3. The aromatic protons would be more complex, perhaps a triplet or a doublet of doublets. But the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests substituents at para positions. So this option might not fit. Also, the ethoxy group would have a triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.0, but the quartet in the NMR is at 4.5. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the integration. The 1H NMR has:\n\n- 1.20 (t,3H)\n- 4.0 (bs,2H)\n- 4.5 (q,2H)\n- 7.0 (d,2H)\n- 8.0 (d,2H)\n\nThe integrals add up to 3+2+2+2+2=11 H. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2, so 11 H in total. So the integrations match.\n\nSo the quartet at 4.5 (2H) is likely OCH2 from an ester. The triplet at 1.2 (3H) is the CH3 of an ethyl group attached to O.\n\nSo looking for an ethyl ester group. So options with ethyl ester would be D and maybe others.\n\nOption D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the ethyl ester would give the triplet and quartet. The quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit high but possible. The NH2 would give a broad peak, but where? In the given NMR, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which is 2H. So that doesn't fit the NH2, which would be more like a singlet but maybe integrating for 2H. Wait, but the NH2 would have two protons, so a singlet integrating for 2H. So 4.0 ppm could be the NH2. But I thought the NH2 is usually around 1-5 ppm, but more like 2-3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the OCH2 in the ester, but that's usually a quartet. Wait, maybe it's a different group. Let me think again.\n\nLooking back, in the NMR:\n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H): likely the OCH2 of the ethyl ester.\n\n1.20 ppm (t,3H): the CH3 of ethyl ester.\n\n4.0 ppm (bs,2H): what else could this be? Maybe a methylene adjacent to an amide group. Or perhaps a CH2 connected to an amine.\n\nWait, let's consider option B again. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure is HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3-C6H4). So the ethoxy group would have triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.0. The formamide's NH would be a broad peak. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which doesn't match. So that's a problem.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The propionate ester would have OCH2CH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1-4.3, but in the NMR it's at 4.5, which is higher. So that's a mismatch. Also, the NH2 would be a broad peak, but in the given data, the 4.0 is a singlet of 2H. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ethyl ester would give triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. The NH2 would be a broad peak. But in the given data, the 4.0 is a singlet of 2H. So perhaps that's the NH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 adjacent to something else. Let me think about the structures again.\n\nIn option D, the structure is O=C-O-CH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 at position 4. So the ethyl ester gives triplet and quartet. The NH2 would be a broad peak, perhaps integrating for 2H. But in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet, which doesn't fit. So maybe option D is not correct.\n\nWait, but let's think about the 4.0 ppm. Could it be a CH2 connected to an amine? Like in the case of an amide. Let's look at option B again. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure is HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3-C6H4). The formamide's NH would be a broad peak, perhaps around 4.0. But it's usually a triplet? Or a singlet? Formamide's NH is typically a singlet because the two H are equivalent. So the 4.0 ppm could be the NH of the formamide. But in that case, the NH would be a singlet, which matches the data. But then, what about the ethoxy group's OCH2? It should be a quartet around 4.0, but in the data it's at 4.5. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 of option D. Wait, but the NH2 is usually a broad peak, and the singlet would integrate for 2H. So perhaps it's the NH2. But why is it at 4.0 ppm? Maybe because it's adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, causing deshielding.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the NMR shifts for the aromatic protons. The downfield shift at 8.0 ppm suggests strong deshielding, which is typical of protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl (ester) or amide. So in option D, the substituents are ester (at 1) and amino (at 4). The protons ortho to the ester would be at higher ppm (8.0), and those ortho to the amino would be at lower (7.0). So that matches the NMR.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nThe triplet at 1.2 is the ethyl ester's CH3.\n\nThe quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2 of the ethyl ester.\n\nThe singlet at 4.0 is the NH2 group. But wait, NH2 usually shows up as a broad peak, but in this case, it's a singlet. Could it be that the NH2 is exchanging and appears as a singlet? Or maybe the NH2 is in a different environment. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not the NH2 but another group.\n\nWait, another thought: in the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is at position 4, and the ester is at position 1. The ester's OCH2 would be at 4.5 as a quartet, and the ethyl's CH3 at 1.2 as triplet. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches. The NH2 would be a broad peak, perhaps integrating for 2H. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. Hmm.\n\nWait, another possibility: the 4.0 ppm is the NH group of an amide. Let's look at option A and B.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with ethoxy at position 3. So the NH2 would be a broad peak. The ethoxy's OCH2 would be a quartet at 4.0. So in the NMR, the quartet would be at 4.0, but in the data, the quartet is at 4.5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide's NH would be a singlet, perhaps at around 4.0. The ethoxy's OCH2 would be at 4.0 as a quartet. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of each option's expected NMR.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nNMR would have:\n\n- 1.20, triplet (CH3OCH2)\n- 4.5, quartet (OCH2)\n- Aromatic protons: 7.0 (d,2H) and 8.0 (d,2H)\n- NH2: broad peak, but where? Maybe at 4.0 as a singlet. But in the data, it's a singlet of 2H at 4.0.\n\nSo perhaps the NH2 is the 4.0 singlet. That could be possible if the NH2 is exchanging and appears as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not showing up as a separate peak because it's in fast exchange and integrated into the aromatic region. But that's less likely.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from another group. Wait, maybe the structure isn't an ester but an amide. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: benzamide with ethoxy. The amide's NH2 would be a broad peak. The ethoxy's OCH2 would be a quartet at 4.0, but in the data, it's at 4.5. So doesn't fit.\n\nOption B: formamide. The formamide's NH would be a singlet. The ethoxy's OCH2 would be a quartet at 4.0, but data has quartet at 4.5.\n\nOption C: propionate ester. OCH2CH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1-4.3, but data has 4.5. So mismatch.\n\nOption D: OCH2CH3 (ester) would have quartet at 4.5, which matches. The NH2 would be a broad peak, but in data, it's a singlet at 4.0. Maybe it's the NH2.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the integration. The NMR shows 4.0 as 2H. If that's the NH2, that makes sense. So the quartet at 4.5 (2H) is OCH2, triplet at 1.2 (3H) is CH3. The aromatic protons are two doublets.\n\nSo in option D, the NH2 would appear as a broad peak. But in the data, the 4.0 is a singlet, which is unusual for NH2. But perhaps in this case, the NH2 is in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 is not the NH2 but another group.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the structure is N-ethyl something. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 3-ethoxybenzamide: structure is CONH2 with OCH2CH3 at 3.\n\nB) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: HCONH- attached to 4-OCH2CH3.\n\nC) 4-aminophenyl propionate: O=C-O-CH2CH2CH3 attached to benzene with NH2 at 4.\n\nD) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: O=C-O-CH2CH3 attached to benzene with NH2 at 4.\n\nSo option C has a propionate ester, which would have a longer chain. The OCH2CH2 would be in the NMR as a quartet at around 4.1 and a triplet at 1.6, but the data shows a quartet at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2, which suggests an ethyl group, not propyl.\n\nSo option C is less likely because the NMR suggests ethyl, not propyl.\n\nSo, among the options, D and B have ethyl groups.\n\nOption B's ethoxy group would give OCH2CH3 as triplet and quartet, but the quartet in the NMR is at 4.5, which is higher than usual.\n\nOption D's ethyl ester would have the quartet at 4.5, which matches. The triplet at 1.2 matches. The aromatic protons match. The 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which could be the NH2.\n\nSo putting it all together, the correct answer is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n\nThe compound C9H11NO2 is identified based on the provided IR and 1H NMR data. The molecular formula indicates a degree of unsaturation of 3, suggesting the presence of a benzene ring (3 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or functional group. The IR spectrum shows strong N-H stretches at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9, consistent with an amine or amide, and a strong carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group.\n\nThe 1H NMR data includes:\n- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, characteristic of a CH3 group in an ethyl group.\n- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, likely from an NH2 group or a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom.\n- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet, consistent with an OCH2 group in an ethyl ester.\n- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  \n   This compound has a benzamide group (CONH2) and an ethoxy group at position 3. The aromatic protons would not produce two simple doublets due to the meta substitution pattern. Additionally, the ethoxy group's OCH2 would appear as a quartet around 4.0 ppm, but the data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm. This mismatch eliminates this option.\n\n2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  \n   This compound has a formamide group (HCONH-) and an ethoxy group at the para position. The aromatic protons would produce two doublets, consistent with the NMR data. However, the ethoxy group's OCH2 would appear as a quartet around 4.0 ppm, while the data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm. This mismatch eliminates this option.\n\n3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  \n   This compound has a propionate ester (O=C-O-CH2CH2CH3) and an amino group at position 4. The NMR data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is consistent with an OCH2 group. However, the propionate ester would also produce a triplet for the CH2 group, which is not observed in the data. Additionally, the NH2 group would typically appear as a broad peak, but the data shows a singlet at 4.0 ppm. This mismatch eliminates this option.\n\n4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  \n   This compound has an ethyl ester (O=C-O-CH2CH3) and an amino group at position 4. The ethyl ester produces a triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH3) and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2), both of which match the NMR data. The aromatic protons produce two doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm, consistent with a para-substituted benzene. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm can be attributed to the NH2 group, which is plausible in this environment. This option matches all the data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.  \nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's see. The options are A to D, each with different structures. I remember that IR and NMR can give clues about functional groups and structure.\n\nStarting with the IR data. The strong bands around 3400 cm-1 are probably N-H stretches. Wait, but looking at the exact values: 3420 and 3325. Those are in the range for either N-H (like amide or amine) or O-H (like alcohol or carboxylic acid). But wait, the presence of two bands could mean two different types of N-H, like in an amide which has two sets of N-H stretches because of the resonance. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine. But I'm not sure yet. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. That could be an ester, amide, ketone, or maybe an acid. But in the options, I see things like benzamide, formamide, propionate, and benzoate. So, the 1720 suggests ester or amide. Because carboxylic acids usually have a broader O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which I don't see here. So maybe it's an ester or an amide.\n\nLooking at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows:\n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, likely from a CH3 group attached to an oxygen, maybe an ethyl group. Like OCH2CH3.\n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Could be adjacent to an oxygen or something else. Maybe an OCH2 group, but the broadness might suggest some exchange, like an NH group. Wait, but in the IR, if there's an amide, that would have N-H. But the NMR doesn't show a peak for that, unless it's exchanging and not showing up, or maybe it's a broad peak elsewhere. Alternatively, the 4.0 could be an OCH2 group, but the broadness is confusing me. Or maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom.\n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. Quadruplet usually comes from being next to a CH2 group. Like if it's a CH2 connected to another CH2. Wait, for ethyl esters, the typical pattern is the OCH2CH3 as a triplet around 1.2 ppm, and the adjacent OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. So in this case, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe because of some electron-withdrawing groups nearby? Like if it's part of an ester next to a carbonyl.\n\nThen, aromatic protons at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Each doublet would have two protons each, so four protons in total, meaning two substituents on the benzene ring. Wait, but benzene has six protons. Oh, wait, no, if it's a para-substituted, then it's two substituents opposite each other, leading to two sets of doublets. So perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each with two protons. Wait, but wait: the substituents could be groups like -OCH2CH3 and something else. Or maybe it's a nitro group and another group, but looking at the molecular formula, I don't see nitro groups. The formula is C9H11NO2, so possible substituents are -OCH2CH3 and -NHCO- or something else.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the substituents on the benzene would be ethoxy and amide (CONH2) groups. But wait, 3-ethoxy would mean the substituents are meta. So the aromatic protons would be more complex, maybe two doublets but perhaps with coupling. Not sure, but let me check the NMR. For benzamide, the NH would show in IR as two peaks, which we have. But in NMR, the amide protons might be broad, but in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Wait, that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 is something else.\n\nOption B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: So the structure is formamide where the N is attached to a 4-ethoxy phenyl group. So the benzene ring would have an ethoxy group at para position. The formamide would have a CONHPh group. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, as they are in the NMR. The ethoxy group would give a triplet at around 1.2 ppm. The formamide has a carbonyl, which would explain the IR at 1720. The NMR would have the OCH2CH3 as triplet, and the OCH2 adjacent to the carbonyl as quartet around 4.5 ppm. Wait, but the quartet in the NMR is at 4.5 ppm, which matches the ethoxy group. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, but in formamide, the NH would be a broad peak, but maybe in the NMR it's not shown because it's exchanging and broad or perhaps it's elsewhere. Wait, but the given NMR doesn't have a peak around 8 or 9 ppm, which is where amide protons usually are. So maybe this is a possibility.\n\nOption C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: So that's an amino group attached to benzene at para position, and a propionate group. Propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO- but as an ester, perhaps. So structure would be something like CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph. Wait, but the molecular formula for C is C9H11NO2. Let's see: Ph is C6H5, so 6 carbons. Then NH would be 1, and the propionate is C3H5O2. Wait, 6+3=9, but 6 (Ph) +3 (propionate) =9. But with the NH group. Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate: C6H5 (5 H?), but the substituents. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would have the structure PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Or maybe it's the ester: OCH2CH2CH3 connected to the carbonyl, and NH2 on the benzene. Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 1.2 (3H), which would fit an ethyl group, not propyl. So maybe C is not the right option. Because propionate would have a triplet for the CH3 at around 0.9, but the given is at 1.2, which is more like an ethyl group. So probably not option C.\n\nOption D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: That would be the benzoate ester with an ethyl group and an amino group on the benzene. Structure would be OEt (ethyl ester) attached to the benzoate, and an NH2 group para to it. So the IR would have the carbonyl of the ester at around 1720, which matches. The IR also has N-H stretches, which would be from the amino group. Wait, but aminobenzoate would have a primary amine (NH2), which typically shows up as two peaks in IR around 3300-3500. That fits the given IR data. The NMR would then have the ethyl ester group: the triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H) for the CH3, and the quartet around 4.0-4.5 ppm for the OCH2. Wait, but in the given data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm (2H), and the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Hmm. The OCH2 from the ethyl ester would typically be a quartet around 4.1-4.3. So the quartet at 4.5 is a bit higher, but that could be due to the electronegative groups nearby. The broad singlet at 4.0 might be something else.\n\nWait, the aromatic protons in D would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Since the substituents are para, that fits the NMR data. So the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. But why are the chemical shifts different? The substituents would be the amino group (NH2) and the ester (OEt). The amino group is deactivating and meta-directing, while the ester is ortho/para-directing. So in the benzene ring, the substituents are at para positions. So the protons adjacent to the amino group would be more deshielded, hence higher ppm. So the 8.0 ppm would be next to the amino group, and 7.0 next to the ester. That makes sense.\n\nNow, looking at the NMR peaks. The quartet at 4.5 ppm would be the OCH2 from the ester. The triplet at 1.2 is the CH3 of the ethyl ester. Then, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Wait, in D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have an NH2 group. The NH2 would show up in the NMR as a broad peak. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Wait, that doesn't quite fit. Because NH2 protons typically appear around 1-5 ppm, but usually higher. Wait, no, actually, in some cases, especially when the amine is part of a conjugated system, the NH2 protons can be broad and might even be in the range of 2-5 ppm. But in the given data, the broad singlet is at 4.0 ppm for 2H. So that could be the NH2 group.\n\nAlternatively, in the structure D, the ethyl ester's OCH2 is a quartet at 4.5, and the NH2 would be a broad singlet around 4.0. So that matches. Let me think about the integration: the 1.2 is 3H (CH3), quartet 4.5 is 2H (OCH2), and the broad singlet at 4.0 is 2H (NH2). That adds up. So that would make sense for D.\n\nAlternatively, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure would have an ethoxy group on the benzene and a formamide group (CONH-Ph). So the OCH2CH3 would be triplet at 1.2, and the OCH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be quartet at 4.5. The formamide has a NH, which is a broad peak, but in the NMR data, the broad singlet is at 4.0 for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit because formamide's NH is typically around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak, but perhaps in this case, it's de-shielded. Or maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the given NMR, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0. If the substituents are ethoxy and formamide, then the protons adjacent to the ethoxy would be less deshielded, so lower ppm, and the formamide group would be more de-shielding. So the protons next to formamide would be at 8.0, and next to ethoxy at 7.0. That fits.\n\nBut then, the NMR in option B would have the OCH2 from ethoxy as quartet, but wait, in the structure of B, the ethoxy is on the benzene, so the OCH2CH3 would be a triplet at 1.2, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3. So the quartet at 4.5 is correct. But the formamide's NH would be a broad peak. But in the NMR given, the broad singlet is at 4.0, which is lower ppm than expected. Hmm, maybe that's a problem. Because formamide's NH is usually around 8 ppm, but perhaps in this case, it's an amide where the NH is part of an aromatic ring and hence shifted downfield.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the IR, the strong band at 1720 cm-1. For formamide, that would be the C=O stretch. For esters, it's also around 1720. So both options B and D have a carbonyl.\n\nSo, for D, the NH2 group is present. So the IR would have two N-H stretches, which matches the IR data. The NMR would have a broad singlet for the NH2, but in the data, the broad singlet is at 4.0 ppm for 2H. That would make sense because NH2 protons are usually broad and could appear in that region, especially if they're part of a conjugated system.\n\nWait, but in the case of D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the benzoate ester would have the structure OEt-C6H4-NH2. The NH2 would be part of the benzene ring. So in the NMR, the NH2 protons would be a broad peak. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So that's a match. The OCH2 from the ethyl ester is a quartet at 4.5 ppm, and the CH3 is triplet at 1.2. So that aligns.\n\nNow, looking at option B again: the structure is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the formamide's NH is attached to the benzene. The formamide's NH would typically show as a broad peak, but where? In the given data, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, but that's not where formamide's NH usually appears. Formamide's NH is usually around 8 ppm or so. So maybe this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm peak is due to the OCH2 group from the ethoxy. Wait, no, because the ethoxy is on the benzene, so its OCH2CH3 would give a triplet at 1.2, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.3. But in the given data, the quartet is at 4.5, so that doesn't fit.\n\nSo maybe D is the correct answer. Let me recap the data for D:\n\n- IR: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 (NH2), and 1720 (ester carbonyl). That fits.\n- NMR: triplet at 1.2 (CH3O), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2), broad singlet at 4.0 (NH2), and aromatic doublets at 7.0 and 8.0. That all matches.\n\nSo the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's see. The options are A to D, each with different structures. I remember that IR and NMR can give clues about functional groups and structure.\n\nStarting with the IR data. The strong bands around 3400 cm-1 are probably N-H stretches. Wait, but looking at the exact values: 3420 and 3325. Those are in the range for either N-H (like amide or amine) or O-H (like alcohol or carboxylic acid). But wait, the presence of two bands could mean two different types of N-H, like in an amide which has two sets of N-H stretches because of the resonance. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine. But I'm not sure yet. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. That could be an ester, amide, ketone, or maybe an acid. But in the options, I see things like benzamide, formamide, propionate, and benzoate. So, the 1720 suggests ester or amide. Because carboxylic acids usually have a broader O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which I don't see here. So maybe it's an ester or an amide.\n\nLooking at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows:\n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, likely from a CH3 group attached to an oxygen, maybe an ethyl group. Like OCH2CH3.\n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Could be adjacent to an oxygen or something else. Maybe an OCH2 group, but the broadness might suggest some exchange, like an NH group. Wait, but in the IR, if there's an amide, that would have N-H. But the NMR doesn't show a peak for that, unless it's exchanging and not showing up, or maybe it's a broad peak elsewhere. Alternatively, the 4.0 could be an OCH2 group, but the broadness is confusing me. Or maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom.\n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. Quadruplet usually comes from being next to a CH2 group. Like if it's a CH2 connected to another CH2. Wait, for ethyl esters, the typical pattern is the OCH2CH3 as a triplet around 1.2 ppm, and the adjacent OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. So in this case, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe because of some electron-withdrawing groups nearby? Like if it's part of an ester next to a carbonyl.\n\nThen, aromatic protons at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Each doublet would have two protons each, so four protons in total, meaning two substituents on the benzene ring. Wait, but benzene has six protons. Oh, wait, no, if it's a para-substituted, then it's two substituents opposite each other, leading to two sets of doublets. So perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each with two protons. Wait, but wait: the substituents could be groups like -OCH2CH3 and something else. Or maybe it's a nitro group and another group, but looking at the molecular formula, I don't see nitro groups. The formula is C9H11NO2, so possible substituents are -OCH2CH3 and -NHCO- or something else.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the substituents on the benzene would be ethoxy and amide (CONH2) groups. But wait, 3-ethoxy would mean the substituents are meta. So the aromatic protons would be more complex, maybe two doublets but perhaps with coupling. Not sure, but let me check the NMR. For benzamide, the NH would show in IR as two peaks, which we have. But in NMR, the amide protons might be broad, but in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Wait, that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 is something else.\n\nOption B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: So the structure is formamide where the N is attached to a 4-ethoxy phenyl group. So the benzene ring would have an ethoxy group at para position. The formamide would have a CONHPh group. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, as they are in the NMR. The ethoxy group would give a triplet at around 1.2 ppm. The formamide has a carbonyl, which would explain the IR at 1720. The NMR would have the OCH2CH3 as triplet, and the OCH2 adjacent to the carbonyl as quartet around 4.5 ppm. Wait, but the quartet in the NMR is at 4.5 ppm, which matches the ethoxy group. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, but in formamide, the NH would be a broad peak, but maybe in the NMR it's not shown because it's exchanging and broad or perhaps it's elsewhere. Wait, but the given NMR doesn't have a peak around 8 or 9 ppm, which is where amide protons usually are. So maybe this is a possibility.\n\nOption C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: So that's an amino group attached to benzene at para position, and a propionate group. Propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO- but as an ester, perhaps. So structure would be something like CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph. Wait, but the molecular formula for C is C9H11NO2. Let's see: Ph is C6H5, so 6 carbons. Then NH would be 1, and the propionate is C3H5O2. Wait, 6+3=9, but 6 (Ph) +3 (propionate) =9. But with the NH group. Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate: C6H5 (5 H?), but the substituents. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would have the structure PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Or maybe it's the ester: OCH2CH2CH3 connected to the carbonyl, and NH2 on the benzene. Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 1.2 (3H), which would fit an ethyl group, not propyl. So maybe C is not the right option. Because propionate would have a triplet for the CH3 at around 0.9, but the given is at 1.2, which is more like an ethyl group. So probably not option C.\n\nOption D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: That would be the benzoate ester with an ethyl group and an amino group on the benzene. Structure would be OEt (ethyl ester) attached to the benzoate, and an NH2 group para to it. So the IR would have the carbonyl of the ester at around 1720, which matches. The IR also has N-H stretches, which would be from the amino group. Wait, but aminobenzoate would have a primary amine (NH2), which typically shows up as two peaks in IR around 3300-3500. That fits the given IR data. The NMR would then have the ethyl ester group: the triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H) for the CH3, and the quartet around 4.0-4.5 ppm for the OCH2. Wait, but in the given data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm (2H), and the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Hmm. The OCH2 from the ethyl ester would typically be a quartet around 4.1-4.3. So the quartet at 4.5 is a bit higher, but that could be due to the electronegative groups nearby. The broad singlet at 4.0 might be something else.\n\nWait, the aromatic protons in D would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Since the substituents are para, that fits the NMR data. So the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. But why are the chemical shifts different? The substituents would be the amino group (NH2) and the ester (OEt). The amino group is deactivating and meta-directing, while the ester is ortho/para-directing. So in the benzene ring, the substituents are at para positions. So the protons adjacent to the amino group would be more deshielded, hence higher ppm. So the 8.0 ppm would be next to the amino group, and 7.0 next to the ester. That makes sense.\n\nNow, looking at the NMR peaks. The quartet at 4.5 ppm would be the OCH2 from the ester. The triplet at 1.2 is the CH3 of the ethyl ester. Then, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Wait, in D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have an NH2 group. The NH2 would show up in the NMR as a broad peak. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Wait, that doesn't quite fit. Because NH2 protons typically appear around 1-5 ppm, but usually higher. Wait, no, actually, in some cases, especially when the amine is part of a conjugated system, the NH2 protons can be broad and might even be in the range of 2-5 ppm. But in the given data, the broad singlet is at 4.0 ppm for 2H. So that could be the NH2 group.\n\nAlternatively, in the structure D, the ethyl ester's OCH2 is a quartet at 4.5, and the NH2 would be a broad singlet around 4.0. So that matches. Let me think about the integration: the 1.2 is 3H (CH3), quartet 4.5 is 2H (OCH2), and the broad singlet at 4.0 is 2H (NH2). That adds up. So that would make sense for D.\n\nAlternatively, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure would have an ethoxy group on the benzene and a formamide group (CONH-Ph). So the OCH2CH3 would be triplet at 1.2, and the OCH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be quartet at 4.5. The formamide has a NH, which is a broad peak, but in the NMR data, the broad singlet is at 4.0 for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit because formamide's NH is typically around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak, but perhaps in this case, it's de-shielded. Or maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the given NMR, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0. If the substituents are ethoxy and formamide, then the protons adjacent to the ethoxy would be less deshielded, so lower ppm, and the formamide group would be more de-shielding. So the protons next to formamide would be at 8.0, and next to ethoxy at 7.0. That fits.\n\nBut then, the NMR in option B would have the OCH2 from ethoxy as quartet, but wait, in the structure of B, the ethoxy is on the benzene, so the OCH2CH3 would be a triplet at 1.2, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3. So the quartet at 4.5 is correct. But the formamide's NH would be a broad peak. But in the NMR given, the broad singlet is at 4.0, which is lower ppm than expected. Hmm, maybe that's a problem. Because formamide's NH is usually around 8 ppm, but perhaps in this case, it's an amide where the NH is part of an aromatic ring and hence shifted downfield.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the IR, the strong band at 1720 cm-1. For formamide, that would be the C=O stretch. For esters, it's also around 1720. So both options B and D have a carbonyl.\n\nSo, for D, the NH2 group is present. So the IR would have two N-H stretches, which matches the IR data. The NMR would have a broad singlet for the NH2, but in the data, the broad singlet is at 4.0 ppm for 2H. That would make sense because NH2 protons are usually broad and could appear in that region, especially if they're part of a conjugated system.\n\nWait, but in the case of D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the benzoate ester would have the structure OEt-C6H4-NH2. The NH2 would be part of the benzene ring. So in the NMR, the NH2 protons would be a broad peak. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So that's a match. The OCH2 from the ethyl ester is a quartet at 4.5 ppm, and the CH3 is triplet at 1.2. So that aligns.\n\nNow, looking at option B again: the structure is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the formamide's NH is attached to the benzene. The formamide's NH would typically show as a broad peak, but where? In the given data, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, but that's not where formamide's NH usually appears. Formamide's NH is usually around 8 ppm or so. So maybe this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm peak is due to the OCH2 group from the ethoxy. Wait, no, because the ethoxy is on the benzene, so its OCH2CH3 would give a triplet at 1.2, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.3. But in the given data, the quartet is at 4.5, so that doesn't fit.\n\nSo maybe D is the correct answer. Let me recap the data for D:\n\n- IR: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 (NH2), and 1720 (ester carbonyl). That fits.\n- NMR: triplet at 1.2 (CH3O), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2), broad singlet at 4.0 (NH2), and aromatic doublets at 7.0 and 8.0. That all matches.\n\nSo the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n\nTo identify the compound C9H11NO2, we analyze the given spectral data:\n\n### IR Data:\n- **Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9**: These are indicative of N-H stretches, likely from an amine or amide group.\n- **Strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9**: This corresponds to a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide.\n\n### \u00b9H NMR Data:\n- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a CH\u2083 group in an ethyl group (OCH\u2082CH\u2083).\n- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, possibly from an NH\u2082 group or an OCH\u2082 group.\n- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, typical of an OCH\u2082 group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  \n   - This compound has an ethoxy group and an amide group on a benzene ring.  \n   - The IR data matches (N-H stretches and carbonyl), but the NMR data does not.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given IR and 1H NMR data. The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, both medium to strong. These are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. O-H would be broader, but N-H can show up as two peaks if there's hydrogen bonding or different environments. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be an amide, ester, or maybe a ketone, but with the formula given, probably an amide or ester.\n\nMoving on to the 1H NMR. Let's break down each peak.\n\n1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: This looks like a methyl group attached to something, probably a CH2. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2 group. So maybe an ethyl group (CH2CH3), where the CH3 is the triplet. So something like OCH2CH3 or maybe part of an ethyl ester.\n\n4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H: Broad signals can be due to exchange, like NH protons. But wait, 2H? So maybe a group where two Hs are next to a functional group. Maybe an amine? Or perhaps an OCH2 group where the Hs are split due to coupling, but if it's a singlet, perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O, but why broad? Or maybe it's an NH2 group, but that's less likely since amines typically have more than 2 H in such cases.\n\n4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H: Quartet suggests splitting into four, which usually comes from coupling with a neighboring CH2 group. So maybe this is a CH2 next to another CH2, like in an ethyl group. Wait, the 1.20 ppm triplet is 3H, and 4.5 ppm quartet is 2H. That sounds like an ethyl ester group: OCH2CH3. Wait, but the quartet is at 4.5. Let me think. In ethyl groups, the CH2 closer to the oxygen is usually around 4.1-4.3, but quartet. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2CH2 group, but not sure yet.\n\n7.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H; 8.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. These look like aromatic protons. The two doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, you have two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that would mean the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2.\n\nSo (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11)/2=9/2=4.5. Hmm, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I did the formula wrong. Let me recalculate. Degree of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C9H11NO2, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2.\n\n(2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11 +1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. Which would mean one ring (benzene, which is 3 degrees), one double bond (like carbonyl, another degree), and an amide or something else. Wait, benzene ring is three degrees, carbonyl is one, and then an amide group (which has a double bond in the carbonyl) and a ring or something else. Alternatively, maybe a ring plus a double bond and a carbonyl.\n\nWait, but let's think about the possible structures. The options are given, so maybe I can think about each one.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide (so a benzene ring with a CONH2 group) and an ethoxy group at the meta position. So the benzene would have two substituents: ethoxy and CONH2. But wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 4.0 ppm which could be the NH2, but that's a broad peak. But benzamide's NH protons are usually around 6-8 ppm, and as a broad peak. Also, the IR would show N-H stretches around 3300-3500, which matches the given IR.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would be formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the benzene has an ethoxy and a formamide group. The formamide would have NH which would show up as broad signals. The formamide's NH would have two protons, which could match the 4.0 ppm singlet (but that's 2H). Wait, but formamide's NH is usually around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak. So the 4.0 ppm might not fit.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure is benzene with NH2 and a propionyl group (CH2CH2COO-). Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-, but in this case, perhaps it's attached as the ester. Wait, maybe it's the amino group and a propionate ester. Hmm, but the NMR would show an NH2 group. But the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which could be the NH2, but in 4-aminophenyl propionate, the NH2 is likely to be a broad peak around 1-5 ppm. Also, the propionate would have a CH2CH2COO group. The NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) and a triplet at 1.20 (3H). That could fit an ethyl ester group. Wait, the 4.5 quartet is 2H, which is the OCH2 in an ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.20 is the CH3 of the ethyl.\n\nSo for option C, the structure would be O=C(O-)CH2CH2- attached to the benzene, along with NH2. So the NMR would have the ethyl ester group (the triplet and quartet) and the aromatic protons. But wait, the aromatic protons in 4-aminophenyl propionate would be at the para position. So the substituents are NH2 and the propionate group. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H, which matches the NMR. The NH2 would appear as a broad peak. But in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. That doesn't quite match. Also, the form would require a propionate ester, but the quartet at 4.5 ppm is 2H, which is the OCH2 in the ethyl group. So that seems possible.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzoate ester with an ethyl group and an amino group at the para position. So the benzene has a COOEt group and an NH2. The benzoate would have a carbonyl, which would fit the IR peak at 1720. The ethyl group would show up as triplet at 1.20 (CH3) and quartet at 4.5 (OCH2). The NH2 would be a broad peak, maybe around 4.0 ppm? But wait, amines are usually broad, but if it's an NH2 group, it's more likely to be around 1-5 ppm, possibly. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H, which matches the NMR.\n\nLooking back at the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. If that's the NH2, that might not fit because NH2 protons are usually broad and can split into a singlet if they're not exchanging, but more likely, they'd be a broad peak, not a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's not the NH2. Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. If it's an NH group, maybe it's an -NH- in an amide or something else. Or perhaps it's an OCH2 group.\n\nWait, looking again at the IR: 3420 and 3325 cm-1. If it's an amide, the N-H stretches would be around 3300-3500, which matches. So the compound could be an amide.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is a benzamide, which is an amide. Option D is a benzoate ester, which would have a carbonyl (ester C=O) but not an amide. So the IR's 3420 and 3325 could correspond to amide N-H.\n\nWait, but the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong band. For esters, the carbonyl is around 1740-1720. For amides, the carbonyl is around 1650-1700, but if it's an aromatic amide, maybe it's a bit higher. So 1720 could be an ester or maybe a substituted amide. Hmm.\n\nOption B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would have a formamide group (HCONR2), so the carbonyl would be around 1680-1700, but the IR is 1720, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's an ester.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1720 is an ester carbonyl. Then the compound would be an ester, not an amide. So options D and C are esters, perhaps.\n\nLooking at the 1H NMR again:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): CH2CH3 group, part of an ethyl ester.\n- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Maybe the NH2 group? But it's a singlet. If it's an NH group, perhaps in an amide. Alternatively, it's an OCH2 group in some other structure. Or maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom, but why is it a singlet?\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2 in ethyl ester, which is a quartet because it's next to a CH3 (the triplet at 1.20).\n- Aromatic protons at 7.0 and 8.0, each d, 2H. So para substitution.\n\nIf the compound is an ethyl ester, then the structure would have a benzene ring with a COOEt group and another substituent. The other substituent would be either an amino group (like option D) or another group.\n\nLooking at the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let's see: the benzene ring has 6 C, so the substituents would be COOEt (which is C3H5O2) and another group with C1H6N. Wait, that doesn't add up. Let me think again.\n\nThe formula is C9H11NO2.\n\nBreaking it down: the benzene is C6H5. Then the substituents would add C3H6NO2. Because C6 + C3 = C9, H5 + H6 = H11, N and O2.\n\nWait, the substituents could be COOEt and NH2. COOEt is (OEt)COO- which is OCH2CH3 and the COO-. So COOEt is C3H5O2.\n\nSo the other substituent would be NH2, which is C0H2N. So total substituents: COOEt (C3H5O2) and NH2 (C0H2N). So the benzene would have two substituents, COOEt and NH2, in the para positions. That would make the molecular formula C6H5(C3H5O2)(NH2). Wait, but wait:\n\nC6 (benzene) + COOEt (C3) = C9. H: benzene has 5 H, COOEt has 5 H (since OEt is CH2CH3, which is 2+3=5 H?), but wait, COOEt is O=C(O-)OCH2CH3. So the ester group has OCH2CH3 (3 H in CH2 and 3 in CH3? Wait no, OCH2CH3 is 2 H on CH2 and 3 H on CH3, totaling 5 H. So benzene (5 H) + substituents: COOEt (5 H) and NH2 (2 H?), but wait, the substituents replace H on benzene. So the formula would be C9H10O2N? Because benzene has 6 C, COOEt has 3 C, so 6+3=9 C. O: COOEt has 2 O, plus the ester O? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me calculate the molecular formula.\n\nEthyl 4-aminobenzoate: the structure is O=C(OEt)C6H4NH2.\n\nBenzoate ester: benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When esterified with ethanol, you replace the -OH with OEt. So benzoic acid (C7H6O2) becomes ethyl benzoate (C9H10O2). Then, if it's 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group adds a NH2. So the molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Because ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2, adding an NH2 (which is -NH2, adds N and 2 H). So C9H10O2 + NH2 (adds 2 H) would be C9H12O2N. Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the substituent is different. Let me think again. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So the benzene ring is 6 C, substituents are 3 C in total. So substituents could be COOEt (3 C) and NH2 (no C). So 6+3=9 C. That works.\n\nSo the substituents are COOEt and NH2. So the structure would be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nSo the NMR:\n\n- The ethyl ester: triplet at 1.20 (CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2).\n- The aromatic protons: two doublets, each 2H, para substitution.\n- The NH2 group would show up as a broad peak. But in the NMR, there's a peak at 4.0 ppm, which is a singlet of 2H. Wait, but in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is on the benzene. So the NH2 protons would typically be around 1-5 ppm, as broad peaks. But the NMR has a peak at 4.0 ppm which is a singlet. So maybe that's the NH2.\n\nBut wait, if the NH2 is in the para position, would it be split into a singlet? Or would it be a broad peak? NH2 protons are usually broad, but sometimes they can be sharp if the exchange is slow. But more likely, they would be broad. However, in some cases, like if it's an amide, the NH could be a singlet. But in an amide, the NH is usually a single proton.\n\nWait, looking at the options again. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which has NH2. So the NH2 would be expected to show as a broad peak, possibly as a triplet or a singlet depending on splitting. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. So maybe that's the NH2. Alternatively, perhaps it's another group.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the 4.0 ppm is not NH2, but perhaps an OCH2 group. Let me think about the other options.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the formamide is HCONR2, where R is the aryl group. So the structure would have a formamide NH, which would show as a broad peak. The ethoxy group would be at 4.0 ppm as OCH2CH3. The ethoxy's CH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.2 ppm, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the IR. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely an ester or an amide. If it's an amide, the carbonyl would be around 1680-1700, but 1720 is a bit high for an amide. So maybe it's an ester.\n\nSo if it's an ester, then looking at the options, D and C are esters.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is benzene with COOEt and NH2 in para positions.\n\nThe 1H NMR would have:\n\n- Ethyl ester: triplet at 1.20 (CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2).\n- Aromatic protons as two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each 2H.\n- The NH2 group as a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. That doesn't fit with NH2. So perhaps that's not the right option.\n\nWait, maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH group in an amide. Let's think about option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at the meta position.\n\nSo the NMR would have:\n\n- Ethoxy group: OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.3 ppm, and the CH3 as triplet at 1.20. So that matches the 1.20 (t) and 4.5 (q) in the NMR. Wait, but the ethoxy's OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.3, but in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe that's not right.\n\nAlso, the IR shows N-H stretches, which would be for the amide. The 1720 cm-1 is a bit high for an amide. Maybe it's an ester.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's count the protons in the NMR.\n\nThe 1H NMR integrals are:\n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H)\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H)\n7.0 ppm (d, 2H)\n8.0 ppm (d, 2H)\n\nTotal H: 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 11 H. Which matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\nSo the structure must account for 11 H.\n\nLooking at each option:\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nStructure: O=C(OCH2CH3)C6H4NH2.\n\nThe ethyl ester contributes 5 H (OCH2CH3: 2 H on CH2, 3 on CH3). The benzene has 4 H (since two substituents, COOEt and NH2, in para). The NH2 has 2 H. So total H: 5 (ester) + 4 (aromatic) + 2 (NH2) = 11 H. That fits.\n\nIn the NMR:\n\n- OCH2CH3: triplet at 1.20 (CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2).\n- Aromatic protons as two doublets, each 2H.\n- NH2: broad peak, perhaps around 4.0 ppm. But in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet of 2H. Hmm. Maybe the NH2 is split into a singlet, but that's unusual.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not NH2. Let me think again.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n\nStructure: HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3.\n\nThe formamide has HCONH-, so the NH would have 1 H. Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see:\n\nPhenyl group: 6 C, HCONH: 2 C, OCH2CH3: 3 C. So 6+2+3=11 C? Wait, no. Wait, formamide is HCONR2. So the structure would be HCONH-(C6H4-OCH2CH3). So the formula would be C8H9NO3? Because:\n\nPhenyl: C6H5, OCH2CH3: C2H5O, HCONH: C2H5NO.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me calculate.\n\nN-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: The formamide group is HCONH- attached to the phenyl. So the formula would be:\n\nPhenyl: C6H5\nOCH2CH3: C2H5O\nHCONH: C2H5NO\n\nWait, adding these up: 6 (C6) + 2 (OCH2CH3) + 2 (HCONH) = 10 C? But the molecular formula is C9, so that's not right. So maybe option B isn't correct.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.\n\nStructure: benzene with NH2 and a propionyl group (CH2CH2COO-) as an ester. Wait, but the formula would be C9H11NO2.\n\nPropionate ester is CH2CH2COOEt? No, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So if it's ethyl propionate, that would be CH2CH2COOEt.\n\nWait, the structure would be O=C(OEt)CH2CH2-C6H4NH2.\n\nSo the formula would be:\n\nC6 (benzene) + 3 (COOEt) + 3 (CH2CH2) + N = C6+3+3 = 12? No, that's not right. Wait, no, the propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so that's 3 C. Plus the ethyl ester (OEt is 2 C). So the total is 6 (benzene) + 3 (COO-) + 2 (OEt) = 11 C. Plus the N from NH2. So the formula is C11H... Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the propionate is part of the substituent on the benzene. So the substituent would be NH2 and OOCR, where R is a propyl group. Hmm, not sure.\n\nMaybe I should think about the NMR again. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) and triplet at 1.20 (3H) suggest an ethyl group, perhaps as an ester. So the structure must have an ethyl ester group.\n\nLooking back at the options, options D and C have ethyl ester groups.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nSo the NMR would have:\n\n- 1.20 (t, CH3CH2O)\n- 4.5 (q, OCH2)\n- Aromatic protons as two doublets\n- NH2 as a broad peak.\n\nBut the NMR shows a peak at 4.0 ppm which is a singlet of 2H. That doesn't fit the NH2. So perhaps that's not the correct option.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Wait, the structure would be O=C(OEt)CH2CH2-C6H4NH2. The ethyl ester would give the triplet and quartet. The NH2 would be a broad peak, but where? The NMR shows 4.0 ppm as a singlet of 2H. Maybe that's not the NH2.\n\nWait, another thought: the 4.0 ppm (2H, singlet) could be an OCH2 group. For example, in a propionate ester, maybe the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be a quartet. Or perhaps it's part of a different structure.\n\nWait, in the case of 4-aminophenyl propionate, the structure is O=C(OEt)CH2CH2-C6H4NH2. So the propionate ester would have the ethyl group as OCH2CH3 (quartet at 4.5, triplet at 1.20). The CH2CH2 group would have protons adjacent to the carbonyl. The central CH2 (between COOEt and benzene) would be a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 groups.\n\nWait, but in the NMR, the only other peaks are the aromatic and the 4.0 ppm. So perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 group, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group. Wait, if the substituent is a methylene adjacent to oxygen, like OCH2CH2COOEt, but that's not matching any options.\n\nWait, let me think about the IR again. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests an ester carbonyl. So the compound is likely an ester. So options D and C are esters.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which has an ester and an amine. The IR shows N-H stretches, which would be from the amine. So the IR makes sense.\n\nIn the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. If the amine is NH2, it's a broad peak, but perhaps it's split into a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 is not the amine but another group.\n\nWait, perhaps the 4.0 is the OCH2 from the ester. No, the OCH2 in the ester is at 4.5 ppm as a quartet.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to match the NMR data to the options.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nNMR expected:\n\n- OCH2CH3: triplet at 1.20 (CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2).\n- Aromatic protons: two doublets, each 2H.\n- NH2: broad peak, maybe around 4.0 ppm, but as a singlet of 2H? Or as a broad peak.\n\nIn the given NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet of 2H. If that's the NH2, then the NH2 would have to be a singlet, which is unusual but possible in some cases. Alternatively, perhaps it's another group.\n\nAnother approach: the 1H NMR of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let me recall typical shifts. The ethyl ester would show up as triplet and quartet. The aromatic protons would be around 7.5-8.5 ppm as doublets. The NH2 would typically be a broad peak, possibly around 1-5 ppm, but not a singlet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NH2 is exchanging and shows as a singlet. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at the options again, perhaps option B is better. Let me think about option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n\nStructure: HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3.\n\nIn this case, the NMR would show:\n\n- OCH2CH3: triplet at 1.20, quartet at 4.5.\n- Aromatic protons: two doublets.\n- The formamide NH would be a broad peak, possibly around 8-9 ppm, but in the given NMR, there's no peak in that region except the aromatic. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formamide NH is around 4.0 ppm, but I don't think so. Formamide NH is usually higher.\n\nSo perhaps option D is the correct one. The 4.0 ppm peak is the NH2, appearing as a singlet. But why a singlet? Maybe because it's in a para position and the coupling is negligible, or perhaps it's due to rapid exchange.\n\nPutting it all together, the IR suggests an ester and possibly an amide or amine. The NMR shows an ethyl ester group, aromatic protons, and a singlet at 4.0 ppm which could be NH2 or another group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the singlet at 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group. Wait, if the structure has a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2, which is split into a quartet. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, another possibility: the 4.0 ppm is an NH group in an amide. Let's think about option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.\n\nStructure: benzamide (CONH2) with ethoxy at meta.\n\nNMR would have:\n\n- OCH2CH3: triplet at 1.20, quartet at 4.5.\n- Aromatic protons: two doublets (if para substituents), but in this case, substituents are at meta (ethoxy and CONH2). So the aromatic protons would be more complex, maybe a triplet or a quartet, but the given NMR shows two doublets. So that might not fit.\n\nWait, the substituents in option A are at meta positions. So the aromatic protons would not be para, so their splitting would be more complex. The given NMR shows two doublets, which suggests para substitution. So option A is less likely.\n\nSo, going back, the most likely structure is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The NMR shows the ethyl ester, aromatic protons, and the NH2 as a singlet at 4.0 ppm. Even though it's unusual, perhaps the NH2 is exchanging rapidly and appears as a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is another group, but I can't think of what else it would be.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe compound C9H11NO2 is identified using the provided IR and 1H NMR data. The IR spectrum shows strong absorption bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicative of N-H or O-H stretches, and a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide. The 1H NMR data includes:\n\n- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet corresponding to a CH3 group in an ethyl group.\n- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, possibly from an NH2 group or another methylene group.\n- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet corresponding to a CH2 group in an ethyl ester.\n- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n\n#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**\n- Structure: Benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at the meta position.\n- The NMR would show aromatic protons with more complex splitting due to meta substitution, not the two doublets observed. Additionally, the IR peak at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is slightly higher than expected for an amide carbonyl. This option is inconsistent with the data.\n\n#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**\n- Structure: Formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group.\n- The formamide NH would typically appear as a broad peak around 8-9 ppm, which is not observed in the NMR.

This option is consistent with all the data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nANSWER: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given IR and 1H NMR data. The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, both medium to strong. These are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. O-H would be broader, but N-H can show up as two peaks if there's hydrogen bonding or different environments. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be an amide, ester, or maybe a ketone, but with the formula given, probably an amide or ester.\n\nMoving on to the 1H NMR. Let's break down each peak.\n\n1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: This looks like a methyl group attached to something, probably a CH2. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2 group. So maybe an ethyl group (CH2CH3), where the CH3 is the triplet. So something like OCH2CH3 or maybe part of an ethyl ester.\n\n4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H: Broad signals can be due to exchange, like NH protons. But wait, 2H? So maybe a group where two Hs are next to a functional group. Maybe an amine? Or perhaps an OCH2 group where the Hs are split due to coupling, but if it's a singlet, perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O, but why broad? Or maybe it's an NH2 group, but that's less likely since amines typically have more than 2 H in such cases.\n\n4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H: Quartet suggests splitting into four, which usually comes from coupling with a neighboring CH2 group. So maybe this is a CH2 next to another CH2, like in an ethyl group. Wait, the 1.20 ppm triplet is 3H, and 4.5 ppm quartet is 2H. That sounds like an ethyl ester group: OCH2CH3. Wait, but the quartet is at 4.5. Let me think. In ethyl groups, the CH2 closer to the oxygen is usually around 4.1-4.3, but quartet. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2CH2 group, but not sure yet.\n\n7.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H; 8.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. These look like aromatic protons. The two doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, you have two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that would mean the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2.\n\nSo (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11)/2=9/2=4.5. Hmm, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I did the formula wrong. Let me recalculate. Degree of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C9H11NO2, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2.\n\n(2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11 +1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. Which would mean one ring (benzene, which is 3 degrees), one double bond (like carbonyl, another degree), and an amide or something else. Wait, benzene ring is three degrees, carbonyl is one, and then an amide group (which has a double bond in the carbonyl) and a ring or something else. Alternatively, maybe a ring plus a double bond and a carbonyl.\n\nWait, but let's think about the possible structures. The options are given, so maybe I can think about each one.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide (so a benzene ring with a CONH2 group) and an ethoxy group at the meta position. So the benzene would have two substituents: ethoxy and CONH2. But wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 4.0 ppm which could be the NH2, but that's a broad peak. But benzamide's NH protons are usually around 6-8 ppm, and as a broad peak. Also, the IR would show N-H stretches around 3300-3500, which matches the given IR.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would be formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the benzene has an ethoxy and a formamide group. The formamide would have NH which would show up as broad signals. The formamide's NH would have two protons, which could match the 4.0 ppm singlet (but that's 2H). Wait, but formamide's NH is usually around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak. So the 4.0 ppm might not fit.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure is benzene with NH2 and a propionyl group (CH2CH2COO-). Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-, but in this case, perhaps it's attached as the ester. Wait, maybe it's the amino group and a propionate ester. Hmm, but the NMR would show an NH2 group. But the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which could be the NH2, but in 4-aminophenyl propionate, the NH2 is likely to be a broad peak around 1-5 ppm. Also, the propionate would have a CH2CH2COO group. The NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) and a triplet at 1.20 (3H). That could fit an ethyl ester group. Wait, the 4.5 quartet is 2H, which is the OCH2 in an ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.20 is the CH3 of the ethyl.\n\nSo for option C, the structure would be O=C(O-)CH2CH2- attached to the benzene, along with NH2. So the NMR would have the ethyl ester group (the triplet and quartet) and the aromatic protons. But wait, the aromatic protons in 4-aminophenyl propionate would be at the para position. So the substituents are NH2 and the propionate group. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H, which matches the NMR. The NH2 would appear as a broad peak. But in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. That doesn't quite match. Also, the form would require a propionate ester, but the quartet at 4.5 ppm is 2H, which is the OCH2 in the ethyl group. So that seems possible.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzoate ester with an ethyl group and an amino group at the para position. So the benzene has a COOEt group and an NH2. The benzoate would have a carbonyl, which would fit the IR peak at 1720. The ethyl group would show up as triplet at 1.20 (CH3) and quartet at 4.5 (OCH2). The NH2 would be a broad peak, maybe around 4.0 ppm? But wait, amines are usually broad, but if it's an NH2 group, it's more likely to be around 1-5 ppm, possibly. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H, which matches the NMR.\n\nLooking back at the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. If that's the NH2, that might not fit because NH2 protons are usually broad and can split into a singlet if they're not exchanging, but more likely, they'd be a broad peak, not a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's not the NH2. Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. If it's an NH group, maybe it's an -NH- in an amide or something else. Or perhaps it's an OCH2 group.\n\nWait, looking again at the IR: 3420 and 3325 cm-1. If it's an amide, the N-H stretches would be around 3300-3500, which matches. So the compound could be an amide.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is a benzamide, which is an amide. Option D is a benzoate ester, which would have a carbonyl (ester C=O) but not an amide. So the IR's 3420 and 3325 could correspond to amide N-H.\n\nWait, but the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong band. For esters, the carbonyl is around 1740-1720. For amides, the carbonyl is around 1650-1700, but if it's an aromatic amide, maybe it's a bit higher. So 1720 could be an ester or maybe a substituted amide. Hmm.\n\nOption B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would have a formamide group (HCONR2), so the carbonyl would be around 1680-1700, but the IR is 1720, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's an ester.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1720 is an ester carbonyl. Then the compound would be an ester, not an amide. So options D and C are esters, perhaps.\n\nLooking at the 1H NMR again:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): CH2CH3 group, part of an ethyl ester.\n- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Maybe the NH2 group? But it's a singlet. If it's an NH group, perhaps in an amide. Alternatively, it's an OCH2 group in some other structure. Or maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom, but why is it a singlet?\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2 in ethyl ester, which is a quartet because it's next to a CH3 (the triplet at 1.20).\n- Aromatic protons at 7.0 and 8.0, each d, 2H. So para substitution.\n\nIf the compound is an ethyl ester, then the structure would have a benzene ring with a COOEt group and another substituent. The other substituent would be either an amino group (like option D) or another group.\n\nLooking at the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let's see: the benzene ring has 6 C, so the substituents would be COOEt (which is C3H5O2) and another group with C1H6N. Wait, that doesn't add up. Let me think again.\n\nThe formula is C9H11NO2.\n\nBreaking it down: the benzene is C6H5. Then the substituents would add C3H6NO2. Because C6 + C3 = C9, H5 + H6 = H11, N and O2.\n\nWait, the substituents could be COOEt and NH2. COOEt is (OEt)COO- which is OCH2CH3 and the COO-. So COOEt is C3H5O2.\n\nSo the other substituent would be NH2, which is C0H2N. So total substituents: COOEt (C3H5O2) and NH2 (C0H2N). So the benzene would have two substituents, COOEt and NH2, in the para positions. That would make the molecular formula C6H5(C3H5O2)(NH2). Wait, but wait:\n\nC6 (benzene) + COOEt (C3) = C9. H: benzene has 5 H, COOEt has 5 H (since OEt is CH2CH3, which is 2+3=5 H?), but wait, COOEt is O=C(O-)OCH2CH3. So the ester group has OCH2CH3 (3 H in CH2 and 3 in CH3? Wait no, OCH2CH3 is 2 H on CH2 and 3 H on CH3, totaling 5 H. So benzene (5 H) + substituents: COOEt (5 H) and NH2 (2 H?), but wait, the substituents replace H on benzene. So the formula would be C9H10O2N? Because benzene has 6 C, COOEt has 3 C, so 6+3=9 C. O: COOEt has 2 O, plus the ester O? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me calculate the molecular formula.\n\nEthyl 4-aminobenzoate: the structure is O=C(OEt)C6H4NH2.\n\nBenzoate ester: benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When esterified with ethanol, you replace the -OH with OEt. So benzoic acid (C7H6O2) becomes ethyl benzoate (C9H10O2). Then, if it's 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group adds a NH2. So the molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Because ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2, adding an NH2 (which is -NH2, adds N and 2 H). So C9H10O2 + NH2 (adds 2 H) would be C9H12O2N. Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the substituent is different. Let me think again. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So the benzene ring is 6 C, substituents are 3 C in total. So substituents could be COOEt (3 C) and NH2 (no C). So 6+3=9 C. That works.\n\nSo the substituents are COOEt and NH2. So the structure would be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nSo the NMR:\n\n- The ethyl ester: triplet at 1.20 (CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2).\n- The aromatic protons: two doublets, each 2H, para substitution.\n- The NH2 group would show up as a broad peak. But in the NMR, there's a peak at 4.0 ppm, which is a singlet of 2H. Wait, but in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is on the benzene. So the NH2 protons would typically be around 1-5 ppm, as broad peaks. But the NMR has a peak at 4.0 ppm which is a singlet. So maybe that's the NH2.\n\nBut wait, if the NH2 is in the para position, would it be split into a singlet? Or would it be a broad peak? NH2 protons are usually broad, but sometimes they can be sharp if the exchange is slow. But more likely, they would be broad. However, in some cases, like if it's an amide, the NH could be a singlet. But in an amide, the NH is usually a single proton.\n\nWait, looking at the options again. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which has NH2. So the NH2 would be expected to show as a broad peak, possibly as a triplet or a singlet depending on splitting. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. So maybe that's the NH2. Alternatively, perhaps it's another group.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the 4.0 ppm is not NH2, but perhaps an OCH2 group. Let me think about the other options.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the formamide is HCONR2, where R is the aryl group. So the structure would have a formamide NH, which would show as a broad peak. The ethoxy group would be at 4.0 ppm as OCH2CH3. The ethoxy's CH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.2 ppm, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the IR. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely an ester or an amide. If it's an amide, the carbonyl would be around 1680-1700, but 1720 is a bit high for an amide. So maybe it's an ester.\n\nSo if it's an ester, then looking at the options, D and C are esters.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is benzene with COOEt and NH2 in para positions.\n\nThe 1H NMR would have:\n\n- Ethyl ester: triplet at 1.20 (CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2).\n- Aromatic protons as two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each 2H.\n- The NH2 group as a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. That doesn't fit with NH2. So perhaps that's not the right option.\n\nWait, maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH group in an amide. Let's think about option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at the meta position.\n\nSo the NMR would have:\n\n- Ethoxy group: OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.3 ppm, and the CH3 as triplet at 1.20. So that matches the 1.20 (t) and 4.5 (q) in the NMR. Wait, but the ethoxy's OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.3, but in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe that's not right.\n\nAlso, the IR shows N-H stretches, which would be for the amide. The 1720 cm-1 is a bit high for an amide. Maybe it's an ester.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's count the protons in the NMR.\n\nThe 1H NMR integrals are:\n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H)\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H)\n7.0 ppm (d, 2H)\n8.0 ppm (d, 2H)\n\nTotal H: 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 11 H. Which matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\nSo the structure must account for 11 H.\n\nLooking at each option:\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nStructure: O=C(OCH2CH3)C6H4NH2.\n\nThe ethyl ester contributes 5 H (OCH2CH3: 2 H on CH2, 3 on CH3). The benzene has 4 H (since two substituents, COOEt and NH2, in para). The NH2 has 2 H. So total H: 5 (ester) + 4 (aromatic) + 2 (NH2) = 11 H. That fits.\n\nIn the NMR:\n\n- OCH2CH3: triplet at 1.20 (CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2).\n- Aromatic protons as two doublets, each 2H.\n- NH2: broad peak, perhaps around 4.0 ppm. But in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet of 2H. Hmm. Maybe the NH2 is split into a singlet, but that's unusual.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not NH2. Let me think again.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n\nStructure: HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3.\n\nThe formamide has HCONH-, so the NH would have 1 H. Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see:\n\nPhenyl group: 6 C, HCONH: 2 C, OCH2CH3: 3 C. So 6+2+3=11 C? Wait, no. Wait, formamide is HCONR2. So the structure would be HCONH-(C6H4-OCH2CH3). So the formula would be C8H9NO3? Because:\n\nPhenyl: C6H5, OCH2CH3: C2H5O, HCONH: C2H5NO.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me calculate.\n\nN-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: The formamide group is HCONH- attached to the phenyl. So the formula would be:\n\nPhenyl: C6H5\nOCH2CH3: C2H5O\nHCONH: C2H5NO\n\nWait, adding these up: 6 (C6) + 2 (OCH2CH3) + 2 (HCONH) = 10 C? But the molecular formula is C9, so that's not right. So maybe option B isn't correct.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.\n\nStructure: benzene with NH2 and a propionyl group (CH2CH2COO-) as an ester. Wait, but the formula would be C9H11NO2.\n\nPropionate ester is CH2CH2COOEt? No, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So if it's ethyl propionate, that would be CH2CH2COOEt.\n\nWait, the structure would be O=C(OEt)CH2CH2-C6H4NH2.\n\nSo the formula would be:\n\nC6 (benzene) + 3 (COOEt) + 3 (CH2CH2) + N = C6+3+3 = 12? No, that's not right. Wait, no, the propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so that's 3 C. Plus the ethyl ester (OEt is 2 C). So the total is 6 (benzene) + 3 (COO-) + 2 (OEt) = 11 C. Plus the N from NH2. So the formula is C11H... Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the propionate is part of the substituent on the benzene. So the substituent would be NH2 and OOCR, where R is a propyl group. Hmm, not sure.\n\nMaybe I should think about the NMR again. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) and triplet at 1.20 (3H) suggest an ethyl group, perhaps as an ester. So the structure must have an ethyl ester group.\n\nLooking back at the options, options D and C have ethyl ester groups.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nSo the NMR would have:\n\n- 1.20 (t, CH3CH2O)\n- 4.5 (q, OCH2)\n- Aromatic protons as two doublets\n- NH2 as a broad peak.\n\nBut the NMR shows a peak at 4.0 ppm which is a singlet of 2H. That doesn't fit the NH2. So perhaps that's not the correct option.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Wait, the structure would be O=C(OEt)CH2CH2-C6H4NH2. The ethyl ester would give the triplet and quartet. The NH2 would be a broad peak, but where? The NMR shows 4.0 ppm as a singlet of 2H. Maybe that's not the NH2.\n\nWait, another thought: the 4.0 ppm (2H, singlet) could be an OCH2 group. For example, in a propionate ester, maybe the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be a quartet. Or perhaps it's part of a different structure.\n\nWait, in the case of 4-aminophenyl propionate, the structure is O=C(OEt)CH2CH2-C6H4NH2. So the propionate ester would have the ethyl group as OCH2CH3 (quartet at 4.5, triplet at 1.20). The CH2CH2 group would have protons adjacent to the carbonyl. The central CH2 (between COOEt and benzene) would be a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 groups.\n\nWait, but in the NMR, the only other peaks are the aromatic and the 4.0 ppm. So perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 group, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group. Wait, if the substituent is a methylene adjacent to oxygen, like OCH2CH2COOEt, but that's not matching any options.\n\nWait, let me think about the IR again. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests an ester carbonyl. So the compound is likely an ester. So options D and C are esters.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which has an ester and an amine. The IR shows N-H stretches, which would be from the amine. So the IR makes sense.\n\nIn the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. If the amine is NH2, it's a broad peak, but perhaps it's split into a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 is not the amine but another group.\n\nWait, perhaps the 4.0 is the OCH2 from the ester. No, the OCH2 in the ester is at 4.5 ppm as a quartet.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to match the NMR data to the options.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nNMR expected:\n\n- OCH2CH3: triplet at 1.20 (CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2).\n- Aromatic protons: two doublets, each 2H.\n- NH2: broad peak, maybe around 4.0 ppm, but as a singlet of 2H? Or as a broad peak.\n\nIn the given NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet of 2H. If that's the NH2, then the NH2 would have to be a singlet, which is unusual but possible in some cases. Alternatively, perhaps it's another group.\n\nAnother approach: the 1H NMR of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let me recall typical shifts. The ethyl ester would show up as triplet and quartet. The aromatic protons would be around 7.5-8.5 ppm as doublets. The NH2 would typically be a broad peak, possibly around 1-5 ppm, but not a singlet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NH2 is exchanging and shows as a singlet. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at the options again, perhaps option B is better. Let me think about option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n\nStructure: HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3.\n\nIn this case, the NMR would show:\n\n- OCH2CH3: triplet at 1.20, quartet at 4.5.\n- Aromatic protons: two doublets.\n- The formamide NH would be a broad peak, possibly around 8-9 ppm, but in the given NMR, there's no peak in that region except the aromatic. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formamide NH is around 4.0 ppm, but I don't think so. Formamide NH is usually higher.\n\nSo perhaps option D is the correct one. The 4.0 ppm peak is the NH2, appearing as a singlet. But why a singlet? Maybe because it's in a para position and the coupling is negligible, or perhaps it's due to rapid exchange.\n\nPutting it all together, the IR suggests an ester and possibly an amide or amine. The NMR shows an ethyl ester group, aromatic protons, and a singlet at 4.0 ppm which could be NH2 or another group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the singlet at 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group. Wait, if the structure has a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2, which is split into a quartet. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, another possibility: the 4.0 ppm is an NH group in an amide. Let's think about option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.\n\nStructure: benzamide (CONH2) with ethoxy at meta.\n\nNMR would have:\n\n- OCH2CH3: triplet at 1.20, quartet at 4.5.\n- Aromatic protons: two doublets (if para substituents), but in this case, substituents are at meta (ethoxy and CONH2). So the aromatic protons would be more complex, maybe a triplet or a quartet, but the given NMR shows two doublets. So that might not fit.\n\nWait, the substituents in option A are at meta positions. So the aromatic protons would not be para, so their splitting would be more complex. The given NMR shows two doublets, which suggests para substitution. So option A is less likely.\n\nSo, going back, the most likely structure is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The NMR shows the ethyl ester, aromatic protons, and the NH2 as a singlet at 4.0 ppm. Even though it's unusual, perhaps the NH2 is exchanging rapidly and appears as a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is another group, but I can't think of what else it would be.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n\n\nThe compound C9H11NO2 is identified using the provided IR and 1H NMR data. The IR spectrum shows strong absorption bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicative of N-H or O-H stretches, and a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide. The 1H NMR data includes:\n\n- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet corresponding to a CH3 group in an ethyl group.\n- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, possibly from an NH2 group or another methylene group.\n- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet corresponding to a CH2 group in an ethyl ester.\n- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n\n#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**\n- Structure: Benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at the meta position.\n- The NMR would show aromatic protons with more complex splitting due to meta substitution, not the two doublets observed. Additionally, the IR peak at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is slightly higher than expected for an amide carbonyl. This option is inconsistent with the data.\n\n#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**\n- Structure: Formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group.\n- The formamide NH would typically appear as a broad peak around 8-9 ppm, which is not observed in the NMR. Additionally, the IR peak at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is slightly higher than expected for a formamide carbonyl. This option does not fit the data.\n\n#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**\n- Structure: A benzene ring with an NH2 group and a propionyl group as an ester.\n- The NMR would show signals for the CH2 groups in the propionate ester, which are not observed. The 4.0 ppm singlet cannot be easily assigned to this structure. This option is inconsistent with the data.\n\n#### **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\n- Structure: A benzene ring with an ethyl ester group (COOEt) and an NH2 group in the para position.\n- The NMR matches well:\n  - The **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** correspond to the ethyl ester group.\n  - The **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** correspond to the aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene.\n  - The **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** can be assigned to the NH2 group, which may appear as a singlet due to rapid exchange or splitting.\n- The IR peak at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 corresponds to the ester carbonyl. This option is consistent with all the data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nANSWER: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.\n\nThe compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. Here, n=9, m=11, x=2, y=1.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20 -14)/2 = 6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could mean three double bonds, or one double bond and two rings, or a combination like a ring and two double bonds. But more likely, probably a benzene ring (which accounts for 3 degrees) and maybe an ester or amide group.\n\nLooking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are probably N-H stretches, maybe from an amide or an amine. The medium to strong intensity suggests that it's either a primary amine (two bands) or an amide (with two N-H stretches). Wait, amides usually have N-H stretches around 3300-3500 cm-1, but they are usually less intense because they are hydrogen bonded. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. Esters have strong absorption around 1740-1700, amides around 1680-1700. So the 1720 is a bit on the higher side, maybe an ester or maybe an amide. Alternatively, a ketone, but the formula doesn't have enough oxygen for that.\n\nLooking at the NMR data. Let's list the peaks:\n\n1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: This is likely a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group). The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2, which makes sense for ethoxy where the CH3 is attached to a CH2.\n\n4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Hmm, a broad peak could be an NH group, but wait, the integration is 2H. NH groups are usually singlets, but if it's a broad singlet, perhaps it's an NH2, but in the options I don't see any with NH2. Alternatively, maybe this is part of an ester group, like OCH2, but that might be split. Or maybe it's an ethylene group adjacent to an oxygen, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a methylene next to an oxygen, like OCH2, but the integration is 2H. Wait, if the ethoxy is OCH2CH3, then the CH3 is at 1.20, triplet. So perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the CH2O connected to the oxygen. But in ethoxy, the CH2 is at around 4.10 ppm as a quartet. Oh wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet, and 4.5 is a quartet of 2H. So perhaps the ethoxy is part of a larger structure.\n\nAnother thought: the 4.5 ppm quartet (q, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to an oxygen, perhaps part of an ester group. Wait, in an ethyl ester, the CH2 would be split into a quartet. For example, in ethyl acetate, the OCH2CH3 group has the CH2 at ~4.1 ppm as a quartet, and the CH3 at ~1.2 ppm as a triplet. So in this case, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit upfield. Maybe it's part of a different structure, like a propionate ester? Or perhaps it's a CH2 attached to another group, like an amide.\n\nLooking again, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe that's an N-CH2 group. Like in an amide where the N is connected to a CH2. For example, in N-ethyl amide, the CH2 would be around 3.3-4.0 ppm, but a broad singlet might indicate some hydrogen bonding or being part of a flexible structure.\n\nThe aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, since the doublets are each integrating 2H, and the coupling would be between the two sets. So for example, a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, each having two protons. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted ring with two substituents, each with two protons. Wait, no, if it's para, then each substituent is on opposite carbons, so each has two protons. So, maybe the substituents are electron-withdrawing groups, causing the protons to be deshielded.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the compound is an ester or amide with an ethoxy group and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at the 3 position. The benzamide group is CONH2. So in the IR, the N-H would show up, but as an amide, which typically has lower intensity N-H peaks because of hydrogen bonding. But in this case, the IR shows strong N-H bands, so maybe that's okay. The NMR would have the ethoxy group, which we have in the data. The aromatic protons would be split differently, perhaps. Wait, in 3-ethoxybenzamide, the substituents are ethoxy (OCH2CH3) at position 3 and the amide group (CONH2) at position 1 (para to each other?), wait no, 3 and 1 are meta. Wait, benzamide is usually para-substituted, but if it's 3-ethoxy, then it's meta. That would cause the aromatic protons to be as two doublets, but perhaps in a different pattern.\n\nOption B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the substituents on the benzene are ethoxy and formamide. The IR would have N-H (amide) and the carbonyl. The NMR would show the ethoxy as triplet and quartet, which we do have. The aromatic region would be a single substituent in para position, so maybe two doublets, each with 2H, which matches the NMR. The HCONR group would have the NH, but in this case, the formamide's NH would be a singlet, but in the NMR, we have a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't quite fit. Or wait, the formamide's NH is a singlet, but the 4.0 ppm in the NMR is a 2H, so that might not match.\n\nOption C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: That would be a propionate ester (CH2CH2COO-) attached to a benzene ring with an amino group. Wait, no, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid and a propyl alcohol. Wait, no, 4-aminophenyl propionate is CH2CH2COO-O-C6H4-NH2. The NMR would have the ethyl group from the propionate. The triplet at 1.20 (3H) would correspond to the CH2CH2COO- group. The quartet at 4.5 ppm would be the OCH2 group. Then the 4.0 ppm (2H) might be the NH2 group, but amines typically show broad peaks. Wait, 4.0 ppm for an NH2? Maybe, but the integration is 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's the OCH2 group, but I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nOption D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Structure is ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So the structure would be O=C(OEt)-C6H4-NH2. Let's see. The IR would have N-H (amide or amine?) Wait, wait, no: 4-aminobenzoate is a carboxylic acid derivative. So the amine is a free NH2 group. So the IR would show N-H stretches for the amine. Amine N-H stretches are usually around 3300-3500 cm-1, which matches the given IR data. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 would correspond to the ester carbonyl (C=O), which is typical for esters around 1740-1720.\n\nThe NMR: the ethoxy group would show up as triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), and quartet at around 4.1-4.3 ppm (2H). Wait, in the given data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is a bit upfield. Maybe the splitting is different. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl ester is split into a quartet at 4.5, which is a bit higher than usual, but possible.\n\nLooking at the aromatic region: the 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group and the ester group in para positions. So the ring is 1,4-disubstituted. The substituents are the amino group (-NH2) and the ester (OEt). So the protons on the ring would be in two doublets, each with 2H, which matches the NMR data. The 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm doublets. The 7.0 ppm might be the protons ortho to the amino group (which is a strong activating group, so the protons would be more shielded, appearing downfield?), wait no, amino is activating, so ortho protons would be deshielded, but in the case of 4-aminobenzoate, the amino is at position 4, and the ester is at position 1. So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 4. So the protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the amino group, and 3 and 5 adjacent to the ester. Wait, no, the ester is at position 1, so the substituents are at 1 and 4. So the protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to the amino group, and 3 and 5 would be ortho to the ester.\n\nWait, amino groups are strong activating groups, so the protons ortho to them would be more deshielded and appear downfield. The ester is a deactivating group, so the protons ortho to it would be less shielded and also appear downfield. But in the NMR, the two doublets are at 7.0 and 8.0. So perhaps the protons ortho to the amino group are at 8.0, and those ortho to the ester are at 7.0? Or the other way around. Alternatively, maybe the amino group is more influential, so the protons adjacent are more downfield.\n\nWait, the amino group is a strong activating group, so the ortho protons would be more deshielded, hence higher ppm. The ester is an electron-withdrawing group, so its ortho protons would be deshielded as well, but maybe not as much. Hmm, but the NMR shows two doublets, one at 7.0 and another at 8.0. Let's say the 8.0 ppm is the protons next to the amino group, and 7.0 is next to the ester.\n\nNow, looking at the other parts of the NMR. The 4.5 ppm quartet is 2H. For an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would typically be a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But here, it's at 4.5, which is a bit upfield. Maybe because of the substituents on the ring affecting the electron density, or perhaps it's not the ethyl group but another group. Wait, in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. What could that be?\n\nIf the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is O=C(OEt)-C6H4-NH2. The NH2 would have protons that might show up in the NMR. But amines typically show broad signals. However, in this case, the NH2 is part of a para-substituted ring, so maybe the NH2 is exchanging and not showing up as a peak, or perhaps it's broad and integrated into the other peaks.\n\nWait, looking back at the NMR data: the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe that's the NH2 group, but NH2 would usually be a broad singlet around 1-5 ppm. But the integration is 2H, which would correspond to two protons. So maybe that's the NH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N.\n\nWait, in the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the only other groups are the ethoxy (OCH2CH3) and the amino group (NH2). So the ethoxy would give the triplet and quartet, which are present. The NH2 would give a broad peak, but how much? If it's a secondary amine, perhaps, but in this case, it's a primary amine. So the NH2 might be exchanging and not showing up, or perhaps the peak is too broad and not observed. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is another group.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 4.0 ppm is an N-CH2 group. For example, in N-ethyl groups attached to a carbonyl. Looking back at the options, option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which would be HCONH-Ph-OEt. The NH would be a singlet, but the integration is 2H, which doesn't fit because the NH would be one proton. Hmm.\n\nWait, option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is O=C-OEt attached to benzene, which has an NH2 in the para position. So the NMR would have the ethoxy group's triplet and quartet, which we have. The aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches. The NH2 group: in the NMR, the broad peak at 4.0 ppm is 2H. But the NH2 has two H, so that might fit. But amines typically show up as broad singlets, but sometimes can be split into multiplets. Wait, but in the case of an aromatic amine, like in 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 would be a broad peak, perhaps around 5-6 ppm, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the 4.0 ppm could be something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group, but that would be part of an ether. But in the options, the only ether is in the ethoxy group, which is already accounted for.\n\nHmm, let's look at the 1H NMR again. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H, and the 4.5 is a quartet for 2H. So perhaps the quartet is the OCH2 of the ethoxy group. Wait, but ethoxy's OCH2 is usually around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. Here it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Could it be an OCH2 connected to something else, like an amide?\n\nWait, option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure would be HCONHR, where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the R group is a benzene ring with ethoxy. The formamide group is HCONH. So the NH would be part of the formamide. But the NMR shows a broad singlet for 2H at 4.0 ppm. Wait, that might not fit, as the formamide's NH is usually a singlet, but with only one H.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, but that's already covered by the ethoxy's CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene attached to an amide group.\n\nWait, looking at option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. Benzamide is CONH2. The NMR would have the ethoxy group, which is accounted for. The aromatic protons would be in a meta arrangement, so perhaps as a triplet and a doublet? I'm not sure. The IR would have N-H from the amide, which is present. But the NMR doesn't show a peak for the amide NH2. Or does it? The amide NH2 would typically show up as a broad peak, but in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So maybe that's the NH2.\n\nWait, but in the case of benzamide, the NH2 is usually a broad peak around 6-8 ppm. So maybe the 4.0 ppm isn't the NH2.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on this. Let's try to match the options with the data.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. The IR has N-H (from NH2) and the ester carbonyl (1720 cm-1). The NMR has ethoxy's triplet and quartet. The aromatic protons as two doublets, which makes sense for para substitution. The 4.0 ppm could be the NH2 group, but that's 2H. Alternatively, perhaps it's not the NH2, but something else.\n\nWait, another approach: let's count the protons.\n\nThe NMR shows:\n\n1.20 (t, 3H) \u2192 ethoxy CH3.\n\n4.0 (bs, 2H) \u2192 ?\n\n4.5 (q, 2H) \u2192 ethoxy CH2.\n\n7.0 (d, 2H) \u2192 aromatic.\n\n8.0 (d, 2H) \u2192 aromatic.\n\nSo total H: 3 + 2 +2 + 4= 11, which matches C9H11NO2.\n\nThe structure would have an ethoxy group, an aromatic ring (6 H, but substituted), and some other groups.\n\nIn ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the aromatic ring has 4 H (two doublets), the ethoxy gives 2H (CH2) and 3H (CH3), and the NH2 gives 2H. That adds up.\n\nSo the 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) is the NH2. Wait, but in the NMR, the NH2 would be a broad peak, but where? Aromatic amines (like aniline) have NH2 around 4-6 ppm. So 4.0 is plausible. But wait, the NH2 is -NH2, which is two H, so the 4.0 ppm is a singlet for 2H, but why is it broad? Because NH2 protons are usually broad due to exchange with water, but in the NMR, it's shown as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not deprotonated, so it's a broad peak.\n\nSo putting it all together, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have the NMR as:\n\n- 1.20 (t,3H) \u2192 CH3OEt.\n\n- 4.0 (bs, 2H) \u2192 NH2.\n\n- 4.5 (q, 2H) \u2192 OEt's CH2.\n\n- Aromatic: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0.\n\nThe IR shows N-H (from NH2) and the ester carbonyl. That matches.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-(4-OEt-phenyl). The IR would show amide N-H (but formamide has two N-H, which are usually sharp, but the IR here shows strong bands, which might fit). The carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, which is a bit lower than the given 1720. Hmm, but maybe in this case, it's higher. \n\nThe NMR would have:\n\n- Ethoxy triplet and quartet, which we have.\n\n- The formamide's NH would be a singlet, but in the NMR, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. That doesn't fit because formamide has only one NH group (HCONH-). So that 2H might not fit.\n\nWait, formamide is HCONH2, so the NH2 would be a broad peak. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH2. But in the given NMR, it's a broad singlet integrating to 2H, which would fit the NH2 of formamide. Then what about the 4.5 ppm quartet? That would be the ethoxy's CH2, which is correct.\n\nThe aromatic region: in N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the substituents are OEt and HCO-NH2 at para positions. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H, which matches the NMR.\n\nSo the 1.20 (CH3OEt), 4.5 (CH2OEt), 4.0 (NH2), and aromatic at 7.0 and 8.0. That seems to fit.\n\nWait, but the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. Formamide's NH2 would be a broad peak, but typically around 6-8 ppm, but maybe in this case, it's downfield due to conjugation.\n\nHmm, now I'm a bit confused between options B and D.\n\nLet me think about the IR. For option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), the carbonyl is an ester, which is around 1720, which matches. The IR would have N-H from the NH2 group, which is correct.\n\nFor option B (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide), the carbonyl is an amide. Amide carbonyls are typically around 1680-1700 cm-1. The given IR is 1720, which is higher. So that suggests it's more likely an ester than an amide. So option B's carbonyl would be lower than 1720, which doesn't match. So the correct option would be D.\n\nSo, the IR at 1720 cm-1 is more consistent with an ester (option D) than an amide (option B).\n\nSo the correct answer is D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe compound C9H11NO2 is analyzed using the provided spectroscopic data:\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Degree of Unsaturation**:  \n   The formula C9H11NO2 gives a degree of unsaturation of 3, indicating the presence of a benzene ring (3 degrees) and possibly an ester or amide group.\n\n2. **IR Data**:  \n   - Strong bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9 suggest the presence of N-H bonds, likely from an amine or amide.  \n   - A strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 indicates a carbonyl group, likely an ester (as esters typically absorb in this range).\n\n3. **1H NMR Data**:  \n   - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet corresponding to a methyl group (CH3) attached to an oxygen, likely part of an ethoxy group.  \n   - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, possibly from an NH2 group.  \n   - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, likely from the CH2 group of an ethoxy group.  \n   - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n4. **Option Analysis**:  \n   - **Option A (3-ethoxybenzamide)**: This structure includes a benzamide group (CONH2) and an ethoxy group. However, the NMR data does not show peaks consistent with the NH2 group of an amide, which would typically appear around 6-8 ppm. Additionally, the aromatic protons would not match the observed splitting pattern.  \n   - **Option B (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide)**: This structure includes a formamide group (HCONH2) and an ethoxy group. While the ethoxy group matches the NMR data, the carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is inconsistent with an amide, which typically absorbs at 1680-1700 cm\u207b\u00b9. Furthermore, the NH2 group of formamide would not account for the 4.0 ppm broad singlet.  \n   - **Option C (4-aminophenyl propionate)**: This structure includes a propionate ester and an amino group. However, the NMR data does not show peaks consistent with a propionate ester, and the aromatic splitting pattern does not match.  \n   - **Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)**: This structure includes an ethyl ester and an amino group. The ethoxy group matches the NMR data (triplet at 1.20 ppm and quartet at 4.5 ppm). The aromatic protons match the para-substitution pattern (two doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm). The NH2 group accounts for the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, and the carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is consistent with an ester.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe spectroscopic data is most consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The IR and NMR data align well with the structure, including the ester carbonyl, ethoxy group, and para-substituted aromatic ring. The NH2 group explains the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm.\n\n**Answer: D**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.\n\nThe compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. Here, n=9, m=11, x=2, y=1.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20 -14)/2 = 6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could mean three double bonds, or one double bond and two rings, or a combination like a ring and two double bonds. But more likely, probably a benzene ring (which accounts for 3 degrees) and maybe an ester or amide group.\n\nLooking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are probably N-H stretches, maybe from an amide or an amine. The medium to strong intensity suggests that it's either a primary amine (two bands) or an amide (with two N-H stretches). Wait, amides usually have N-H stretches around 3300-3500 cm-1, but they are usually less intense because they are hydrogen bonded. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. Esters have strong absorption around 1740-1700, amides around 1680-1700. So the 1720 is a bit on the higher side, maybe an ester or maybe an amide. Alternatively, a ketone, but the formula doesn't have enough oxygen for that.\n\nLooking at the NMR data. Let's list the peaks:\n\n1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: This is likely a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group). The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2, which makes sense for ethoxy where the CH3 is attached to a CH2.\n\n4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Hmm, a broad peak could be an NH group, but wait, the integration is 2H. NH groups are usually singlets, but if it's a broad singlet, perhaps it's an NH2, but in the options I don't see any with NH2. Alternatively, maybe this is part of an ester group, like OCH2, but that might be split. Or maybe it's an ethylene group adjacent to an oxygen, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a methylene next to an oxygen, like OCH2, but the integration is 2H. Wait, if the ethoxy is OCH2CH3, then the CH3 is at 1.20, triplet. So perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the CH2O connected to the oxygen. But in ethoxy, the CH2 is at around 4.10 ppm as a quartet. Oh wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet, and 4.5 is a quartet of 2H. So perhaps the ethoxy is part of a larger structure.\n\nAnother thought: the 4.5 ppm quartet (q, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to an oxygen, perhaps part of an ester group. Wait, in an ethyl ester, the CH2 would be split into a quartet. For example, in ethyl acetate, the OCH2CH3 group has the CH2 at ~4.1 ppm as a quartet, and the CH3 at ~1.2 ppm as a triplet. So in this case, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit upfield. Maybe it's part of a different structure, like a propionate ester? Or perhaps it's a CH2 attached to another group, like an amide.\n\nLooking again, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe that's an N-CH2 group. Like in an amide where the N is connected to a CH2. For example, in N-ethyl amide, the CH2 would be around 3.3-4.0 ppm, but a broad singlet might indicate some hydrogen bonding or being part of a flexible structure.\n\nThe aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, since the doublets are each integrating 2H, and the coupling would be between the two sets. So for example, a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, each having two protons. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted ring with two substituents, each with two protons. Wait, no, if it's para, then each substituent is on opposite carbons, so each has two protons. So, maybe the substituents are electron-withdrawing groups, causing the protons to be deshielded.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the compound is an ester or amide with an ethoxy group and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at the 3 position. The benzamide group is CONH2. So in the IR, the N-H would show up, but as an amide, which typically has lower intensity N-H peaks because of hydrogen bonding. But in this case, the IR shows strong N-H bands, so maybe that's okay. The NMR would have the ethoxy group, which we have in the data. The aromatic protons would be split differently, perhaps. Wait, in 3-ethoxybenzamide, the substituents are ethoxy (OCH2CH3) at position 3 and the amide group (CONH2) at position 1 (para to each other?), wait no, 3 and 1 are meta. Wait, benzamide is usually para-substituted, but if it's 3-ethoxy, then it's meta. That would cause the aromatic protons to be as two doublets, but perhaps in a different pattern.\n\nOption B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the substituents on the benzene are ethoxy and formamide. The IR would have N-H (amide) and the carbonyl. The NMR would show the ethoxy as triplet and quartet, which we do have. The aromatic region would be a single substituent in para position, so maybe two doublets, each with 2H, which matches the NMR. The HCONR group would have the NH, but in this case, the formamide's NH would be a singlet, but in the NMR, we have a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't quite fit. Or wait, the formamide's NH is a singlet, but the 4.0 ppm in the NMR is a 2H, so that might not match.\n\nOption C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: That would be a propionate ester (CH2CH2COO-) attached to a benzene ring with an amino group. Wait, no, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid and a propyl alcohol. Wait, no, 4-aminophenyl propionate is CH2CH2COO-O-C6H4-NH2. The NMR would have the ethyl group from the propionate. The triplet at 1.20 (3H) would correspond to the CH2CH2COO- group. The quartet at 4.5 ppm would be the OCH2 group. Then the 4.0 ppm (2H) might be the NH2 group, but amines typically show broad peaks. Wait, 4.0 ppm for an NH2? Maybe, but the integration is 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's the OCH2 group, but I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nOption D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Structure is ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So the structure would be O=C(OEt)-C6H4-NH2. Let's see. The IR would have N-H (amide or amine?) Wait, wait, no: 4-aminobenzoate is a carboxylic acid derivative. So the amine is a free NH2 group. So the IR would show N-H stretches for the amine. Amine N-H stretches are usually around 3300-3500 cm-1, which matches the given IR data. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 would correspond to the ester carbonyl (C=O), which is typical for esters around 1740-1720.\n\nThe NMR: the ethoxy group would show up as triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), and quartet at around 4.1-4.3 ppm (2H). Wait, in the given data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is a bit upfield. Maybe the splitting is different. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl ester is split into a quartet at 4.5, which is a bit higher than usual, but possible.\n\nLooking at the aromatic region: the 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group and the ester group in para positions. So the ring is 1,4-disubstituted. The substituents are the amino group (-NH2) and the ester (OEt). So the protons on the ring would be in two doublets, each with 2H, which matches the NMR data. The 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm doublets. The 7.0 ppm might be the protons ortho to the amino group (which is a strong activating group, so the protons would be more shielded, appearing downfield?), wait no, amino is activating, so ortho protons would be deshielded, but in the case of 4-aminobenzoate, the amino is at position 4, and the ester is at position 1. So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 4. So the protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the amino group, and 3 and 5 adjacent to the ester. Wait, no, the ester is at position 1, so the substituents are at 1 and 4. So the protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to the amino group, and 3 and 5 would be ortho to the ester.\n\nWait, amino groups are strong activating groups, so the protons ortho to them would be more deshielded and appear downfield. The ester is a deactivating group, so the protons ortho to it would be less shielded and also appear downfield. But in the NMR, the two doublets are at 7.0 and 8.0. So perhaps the protons ortho to the amino group are at 8.0, and those ortho to the ester are at 7.0? Or the other way around. Alternatively, maybe the amino group is more influential, so the protons adjacent are more downfield.\n\nWait, the amino group is a strong activating group, so the ortho protons would be more deshielded, hence higher ppm. The ester is an electron-withdrawing group, so its ortho protons would be deshielded as well, but maybe not as much. Hmm, but the NMR shows two doublets, one at 7.0 and another at 8.0. Let's say the 8.0 ppm is the protons next to the amino group, and 7.0 is next to the ester.\n\nNow, looking at the other parts of the NMR. The 4.5 ppm quartet is 2H. For an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would typically be a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But here, it's at 4.5, which is a bit upfield. Maybe because of the substituents on the ring affecting the electron density, or perhaps it's not the ethyl group but another group. Wait, in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. What could that be?\n\nIf the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is O=C(OEt)-C6H4-NH2. The NH2 would have protons that might show up in the NMR. But amines typically show broad signals. However, in this case, the NH2 is part of a para-substituted ring, so maybe the NH2 is exchanging and not showing up as a peak, or perhaps it's broad and integrated into the other peaks.\n\nWait, looking back at the NMR data: the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe that's the NH2 group, but NH2 would usually be a broad singlet around 1-5 ppm. But the integration is 2H, which would correspond to two protons. So maybe that's the NH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N.\n\nWait, in the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the only other groups are the ethoxy (OCH2CH3) and the amino group (NH2). So the ethoxy would give the triplet and quartet, which are present. The NH2 would give a broad peak, but how much? If it's a secondary amine, perhaps, but in this case, it's a primary amine. So the NH2 might be exchanging and not showing up, or perhaps the peak is too broad and not observed. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is another group.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 4.0 ppm is an N-CH2 group. For example, in N-ethyl groups attached to a carbonyl. Looking back at the options, option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which would be HCONH-Ph-OEt. The NH would be a singlet, but the integration is 2H, which doesn't fit because the NH would be one proton. Hmm.\n\nWait, option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is O=C-OEt attached to benzene, which has an NH2 in the para position. So the NMR would have the ethoxy group's triplet and quartet, which we have. The aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches. The NH2 group: in the NMR, the broad peak at 4.0 ppm is 2H. But the NH2 has two H, so that might fit. But amines typically show up as broad singlets, but sometimes can be split into multiplets. Wait, but in the case of an aromatic amine, like in 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 would be a broad peak, perhaps around 5-6 ppm, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the 4.0 ppm could be something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group, but that would be part of an ether. But in the options, the only ether is in the ethoxy group, which is already accounted for.\n\nHmm, let's look at the 1H NMR again. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H, and the 4.5 is a quartet for 2H. So perhaps the quartet is the OCH2 of the ethoxy group. Wait, but ethoxy's OCH2 is usually around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. Here it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Could it be an OCH2 connected to something else, like an amide?\n\nWait, option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure would be HCONHR, where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the R group is a benzene ring with ethoxy. The formamide group is HCONH. So the NH would be part of the formamide. But the NMR shows a broad singlet for 2H at 4.0 ppm. Wait, that might not fit, as the formamide's NH is usually a singlet, but with only one H.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, but that's already covered by the ethoxy's CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene attached to an amide group.\n\nWait, looking at option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. Benzamide is CONH2. The NMR would have the ethoxy group, which is accounted for. The aromatic protons would be in a meta arrangement, so perhaps as a triplet and a doublet? I'm not sure. The IR would have N-H from the amide, which is present. But the NMR doesn't show a peak for the amide NH2. Or does it? The amide NH2 would typically show up as a broad peak, but in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So maybe that's the NH2.\n\nWait, but in the case of benzamide, the NH2 is usually a broad peak around 6-8 ppm. So maybe the 4.0 ppm isn't the NH2.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on this. Let's try to match the options with the data.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. The IR has N-H (from NH2) and the ester carbonyl (1720 cm-1). The NMR has ethoxy's triplet and quartet. The aromatic protons as two doublets, which makes sense for para substitution. The 4.0 ppm could be the NH2 group, but that's 2H. Alternatively, perhaps it's not the NH2, but something else.\n\nWait, another approach: let's count the protons.\n\nThe NMR shows:\n\n1.20 (t, 3H) \u2192 ethoxy CH3.\n\n4.0 (bs, 2H) \u2192 ?\n\n4.5 (q, 2H) \u2192 ethoxy CH2.\n\n7.0 (d, 2H) \u2192 aromatic.\n\n8.0 (d, 2H) \u2192 aromatic.\n\nSo total H: 3 + 2 +2 + 4= 11, which matches C9H11NO2.\n\nThe structure would have an ethoxy group, an aromatic ring (6 H, but substituted), and some other groups.\n\nIn ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the aromatic ring has 4 H (two doublets), the ethoxy gives 2H (CH2) and 3H (CH3), and the NH2 gives 2H. That adds up.\n\nSo the 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) is the NH2. Wait, but in the NMR, the NH2 would be a broad peak, but where? Aromatic amines (like aniline) have NH2 around 4-6 ppm. So 4.0 is plausible. But wait, the NH2 is -NH2, which is two H, so the 4.0 ppm is a singlet for 2H, but why is it broad? Because NH2 protons are usually broad due to exchange with water, but in the NMR, it's shown as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not deprotonated, so it's a broad peak.\n\nSo putting it all together, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have the NMR as:\n\n- 1.20 (t,3H) \u2192 CH3OEt.\n\n- 4.0 (bs, 2H) \u2192 NH2.\n\n- 4.5 (q, 2H) \u2192 OEt's CH2.\n\n- Aromatic: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0.\n\nThe IR shows N-H (from NH2) and the ester carbonyl. That matches.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-(4-OEt-phenyl). The IR would show amide N-H (but formamide has two N-H, which are usually sharp, but the IR here shows strong bands, which might fit). The carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, which is a bit lower than the given 1720. Hmm, but maybe in this case, it's higher. \n\nThe NMR would have:\n\n- Ethoxy triplet and quartet, which we have.\n\n- The formamide's NH would be a singlet, but in the NMR, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. That doesn't fit because formamide has only one NH group (HCONH-). So that 2H might not fit.\n\nWait, formamide is HCONH2, so the NH2 would be a broad peak. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH2. But in the given NMR, it's a broad singlet integrating to 2H, which would fit the NH2 of formamide. Then what about the 4.5 ppm quartet? That would be the ethoxy's CH2, which is correct.\n\nThe aromatic region: in N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the substituents are OEt and HCO-NH2 at para positions. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H, which matches the NMR.\n\nSo the 1.20 (CH3OEt), 4.5 (CH2OEt), 4.0 (NH2), and aromatic at 7.0 and 8.0. That seems to fit.\n\nWait, but the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. Formamide's NH2 would be a broad peak, but typically around 6-8 ppm, but maybe in this case, it's downfield due to conjugation.\n\nHmm, now I'm a bit confused between options B and D.\n\nLet me think about the IR. For option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), the carbonyl is an ester, which is around 1720, which matches. The IR would have N-H from the NH2 group, which is correct.\n\nFor option B (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide), the carbonyl is an amide. Amide carbonyls are typically around 1680-1700 cm-1. The given IR is 1720, which is higher. So that suggests it's more likely an ester than an amide. So option B's carbonyl would be lower than 1720, which doesn't match. So the correct option would be D.\n\nSo, the IR at 1720 cm-1 is more consistent with an ester (option D) than an amide (option B).\n\nSo the correct answer is D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n\nThe compound C9H11NO2 is analyzed using the provided spectroscopic data:\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Degree of Unsaturation**:  \n   The formula C9H11NO2 gives a degree of unsaturation of 3, indicating the presence of a benzene ring (3 degrees) and possibly an ester or amide group.\n\n2. **IR Data**:  \n   - Strong bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9 suggest the presence of N-H bonds, likely from an amine or amide.  \n   - A strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 indicates a carbonyl group, likely an ester (as esters typically absorb in this range).\n\n3. **1H NMR Data**:  \n   - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet corresponding to a methyl group (CH3) attached to an oxygen, likely part of an ethoxy group.  \n   - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, possibly from an NH2 group.  \n   - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, likely from the CH2 group of an ethoxy group.  \n   - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n4. **Option Analysis**:  \n   - **Option A (3-ethoxybenzamide)**: This structure includes a benzamide group (CONH2) and an ethoxy group. However, the NMR data does not show peaks consistent with the NH2 group of an amide, which would typically appear around 6-8 ppm. Additionally, the aromatic protons would not match the observed splitting pattern.  \n   - **Option B (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide)**: This structure includes a formamide group (HCONH2) and an ethoxy group. While the ethoxy group matches the NMR data, the carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is inconsistent with an amide, which typically absorbs at 1680-1700 cm\u207b\u00b9. Furthermore, the NH2 group of formamide would not account for the 4.0 ppm broad singlet.  \n   - **Option C (4-aminophenyl propionate)**: This structure includes a propionate ester and an amino group. However, the NMR data does not show peaks consistent with a propionate ester, and the aromatic splitting pattern does not match.  \n   - **Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)**: This structure includes an ethyl ester and an amino group. The ethoxy group matches the NMR data (triplet at 1.20 ppm and quartet at 4.5 ppm). The aromatic protons match the para-substitution pattern (two doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm). The NH2 group accounts for the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, and the carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is consistent with an ester.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe spectroscopic data is most consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The IR and NMR data align well with the structure, including the ester carbonyl, ethoxy group, and para-substituted aromatic ring. The NH2 group explains the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm.\n\n**Answer: D**",
