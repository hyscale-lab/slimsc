      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about energy levels and their lifetimes, and figuring out the energy difference needed so that two states can be clearly distinguished.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The question is asking which energy difference between them allows us to clearly resolve these two levels. The options are A through D, with various exponents on 10 and eV units.\n\nHmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) and the uncertainty in time (\u0394t) is on the order of \u0127 (h-bar), which is Planck's constant over 2\u03c0. So, the formula is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2 or something like that. Wait, more accurately, it's \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. But for an order of magnitude, maybe we can just say \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/\u0394t.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact form. Let me think. The time here is the lifetime of the state. So for each state, the lifetime is the time for which the state exists before decaying. So the uncertainty in time, \u0394t, for each state would be roughly the lifetime itself, right? Because if the state exists for a short time, we're less certain about when exactly it will decay, so the uncertainty in the time measurement is about the same as the lifetime.\n\nSo for E1, the lifetime \u03c41 is 1e-9 seconds. So the uncertainty in time \u0394t1 is about 1e-9 s. Similarly, \u03c42 is 1e-8 s, so \u0394t2 is about 1e-8 s. But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So perhaps the energy difference \u0394E needs to be such that when multiplied by the appropriate time, it gives a value greater than \u0127. Because if \u0394E is too small, the two states' energies would blur together and not be distinguishable.\n\nWait, but which time should I use for \u0394t? Because if I'm considering the energy difference between two states, perhaps the relevant time is the average of the two lifetimes, or maybe the longer one. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the time uncertainty is the time over which the energy is measured. Or perhaps it's the time during which the system is observed, which would relate to the lifetimes.\n\nWait, another approach: The energy resolution required to distinguish two energy levels is determined by the uncertainty principle. The minimum energy difference \u0394E needed is approximately \u0127 divided by the time available for measurement. But what's the time here?\n\nWait, perhaps the time is the average of the two lifetimes. Or maybe it's the time during which the system is in a state, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps each state's lifetime contributes to the uncertainty in its own energy, but when comparing two states, maybe the time is the time it takes for the system to transition between states, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the uncertainty in energy for each state and then find the energy difference that's larger than the sum of these uncertainties. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is \u0127/(2\u03c4), and the total uncertainty would be the sum of these, so \u0394E_total \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c41) + \u0127/(2\u03c42). But that might be overcomplicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum \u0394E is determined by the maximum of the two uncertainties, since you need the energy difference to be larger than either uncertainty to distinguish them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So for E1, \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u03c41), and for E2, \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u03c42). So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the maximum of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, or perhaps the sum? Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. The energy-time uncertainty principle says that if you have a state with a short lifetime (like E1 with \u03c4=1e-9 s), the energy is uncertain by \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/\u03c4. So for E1, \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(1e-9 s). Similarly, for E2, \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(1e-8 s). \n\nSo to distinguish E2 and E1, the energy difference between them (\u0394E = E2 - E1) must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is less than the sum, their uncertainties might overlap, making them indistinguishable.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's more precise to consider that the energy resolution required is such that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So, if the energy difference is larger than either \u0394E1 or \u0394E2, then they can be resolved. Because each state's energy is uncertain by their own \u0394E. So if \u0394E (E2-E1) is greater than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, then their energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\nSo let's compute the \u0394E for each state. Let me recall that \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But since the options are in eV, maybe I should convert \u0127 to eV\u00b7s.\n\n1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So \u0127 in eV\u00b7s is:\n\n\u0127 \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 eV / 1.60218e-19 J) \u2248 (1.05457e-34 / 1.60218e-19) eV\u00b7s \u2248 approximately 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nNow, let's compute \u0394E for each state.\n\nFor E1: \u03c41 = 1e-9 s.\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c41 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) )= 6.582e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for E2: \u03c42 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c42 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (1e-8 s) )= 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainty in E1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and for E2, it's about 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So E1 has a larger uncertainty because its lifetime is shorter. So to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference between them must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the larger uncertainty, the two energies would overlap in their uncertainty ranges, making them indistinguishable.\n\nSo the maximum uncertainty is \u0394E1 = 6.58e-7 eV. So the energy difference \u0394E must be greater than 6.58e-7 eV to be distinguishable.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 eV \u2192 1e-9 eV is way smaller than 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 6.58e-7. So that's way bigger.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 1e-8 is larger than 6.58e-8? Wait, 6.58e-8 is 0.658e-7. So 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is less than 6.58e-8.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute the numerical values.\n\n\u0394E1 = 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.\n\n\u0394E2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 = 6.58e-7 eV, which is 0.658e-6 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than this, right? Because if the energy difference is less than 6.58e-7 eV, the two states' energies would have overlapping uncertainties, making them indistinguishable.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than 6.58e-7. So that's way bigger than the required uncertainty. So the energy difference is easily distinguishable.\n\nOption D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01 times 1e-6 eV. But 1e-8 is smaller than 6.58e-8? Wait, 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, and 6.58e-8 is 0.658e-7. So 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is less than 0.658e-7. So 1e-8 eV is smaller than the required \u0394E. Therefore, option D is not sufficient.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because the energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps the larger of the two.\n\nWait, each energy has its own uncertainty. So the energy levels are E1 \u00b1 \u0394E1 and E2 \u00b1 \u0394E2. So the separation between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties to make sure that the ranges don't overlap.\n\nWait, no, perhaps that's not the right way. Because if \u0394E is the energy difference between E2 and E1, then for them to be resolvable, \u0394E should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in each energy.\n\nWait, let's think about it. Imagine E1 has an uncertainty of \u0394E1, and E2 has \u0394E2. The energy difference between E2 and E1 is \u0394E = E2 - E1. To have them not overlap, \u0394E must be greater than \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. Because if \u0394E is less than the sum, there's an overlap.\n\nSo in this case, the sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = approximately 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than about 7.2e-7 eV. Let's look at the options:\n\nOption C: 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. That's 1e4 times larger than 7.2e-7 eV. So it's way bigger than needed.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV = 0.00000001 eV. That's way smaller than 7.2e-7. So that's not enough.\n\nSo the only option that's larger than the required 7.2e-7 eV is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the numbers.\n\nWait, \u0127 is approximately 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\n\u03c41 = 1e-9 s \u2192 \u0394E1 = 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV.\n\n\u03c42 = 1e-8 s \u2192 \u0394E2 = 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than that.\n\nLooking at options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 \u2192 0.001 \u03bceV \u2192 way too small.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 10,000 times larger than 7.238e-7. So that's way more than enough.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.1e-7 eV \u2192 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is 0.1e-7 = 0.1 * 1e-7 = 1e-8. So 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is 1e-8 eV. That's much less than 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo only option C is larger than the required sum. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV\n\nB) 1e-11 eV\n\nC) 1e-4 eV\n\nD) 1e-8 eV\n\nSo, only option C meets the condition that the energy difference is larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through.

So the uncertainty in time \u0394t1 is about 1e-9 s. Similarly, \u03c42 is 1e-8 s, so \u0394t2 is about 1e-8 s. But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So perhaps the energy difference \u0394E needs to be such that when multiplied by the appropriate time, it gives a value greater than \u0127. Because if \u0394E is too small, the two states' energies would blur together and not be distinguishable.\n\nWait, but which time should I use for \u0394t? Because if I'm considering the energy difference between two states, perhaps the relevant time is the average of the two lifetimes, or maybe the longer one. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the time uncertainty is the time over which the energy is measured. Or perhaps it's the time during which the system is observed, which would relate to the lifetimes.\n\nWait, another approach: The energy resolution required to distinguish two energy levels is determined by the uncertainty principle. The minimum energy difference \u0394E needed is approximately \u0127 divided by the time available for measurement. But what's the time here?\n\nWait, perhaps the time is the average of the two lifetimes. Or maybe it's the time during which the system is in a state, but I'm not certain.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is \u0127/(2\u03c4), and the total uncertainty would be the sum of these, so \u0394E_total \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c41) + \u0127/(2\u03c42). But that might be overcomplicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum \u0394E is determined by the maximum of the two uncertainties, since you need the energy difference to be larger than either uncertainty to distinguish them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So for E1, \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u03c41), and for E2, \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u03c42). So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the maximum of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, or perhaps the sum? Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. The energy-time uncertainty principle says that if you have a state with a short lifetime (like E1 with \u03c4=1e-9 s), the energy is uncertain by \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/\u03c4. So for E1, \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(1e-9 s). Similarly, for E2, \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(1e-8 s). \n\nSo to distinguish E2 and E1, the energy difference between them (\u0394E = E2 - E1) must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is less than the sum, their uncertainties might overlap, making them indistinguishable.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's more precise to consider that the energy resolution required is such that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So, if the energy difference is larger than either \u0394E1 or \u0394E2, then they can be resolved. Because each state's energy is uncertain by their own \u0394E. So if \u0394E (E2-E1) is greater than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, then their energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\nSo let's compute the \u0394E for each state. Let me recall that \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But since the options are in eV, maybe I should convert \u0127 to eV\u00b7s.\n\n1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So \u0127 in eV\u00b7s is:\n\n\u0127 \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 eV / 1.60218e-19 J) \u2248 (1.05457e-34 / 1.60218e-19) eV\u00b7s \u2248 approximately 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nNow, let's compute \u0394E for each state.\n\nFor E1: \u03c41 = 1e-9 s.\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c41 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) )= 6.582e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for E2: \u03c42 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c42 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (1e-8 s) )= 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainty in E1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and for E2, it's about 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So E1 has a larger uncertainty because its lifetime is shorter. So to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference between them must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the larger uncertainty, the two energies would overlap in their uncertainty ranges, making them indistinguishable.\n\nSo the maximum uncertainty is \u0394E1 = 6.58e-7 eV. So the energy difference \u0394E must be greater than 6.58e-7 eV to be distinguishable.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 eV \u2192 1e-9 eV is way smaller than 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 6.58e-7. So that's way bigger.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 1e-8 is larger than 6.58e-8? Wait, 6.58e-8 is 0.658e-7. So 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is less than 6.58e-8.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute the numerical values.\n\n\u0394E1 = 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.\n\n\u0394E2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 = 6.58e-7 eV, which is 0.658e-6 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than this, right? Because if the energy difference is less than 6.58e-7 eV, the two states' energies would have overlapping uncertainties, making them indistinguishable.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than 6.58e-7. So that's way bigger than the required uncertainty. So the energy difference is easily distinguishable.\n\nOption D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01 times 1e-6 eV. But 1e-8 is smaller than 6.58e-8? Wait, 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, and 6.58e-8 is 0.658e-7. So 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is less than 0.658e-7. So 1e-8 eV is smaller than the required \u0394E. Therefore, option D is not sufficient.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because the energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps the larger of the two.\n\nWait, each energy has its own uncertainty. So the energy levels are E1 \u00b1 \u0394E1 and E2 \u00b1 \u0394E2. So the separation between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties to make sure that the ranges don't overlap.\n\nWait, no, perhaps that's not the right way. Because if \u0394E is the energy difference between E2 and E1, then for them to be resolvable, \u0394E should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in each energy.\n\nWait, let's think about it. Imagine E1 has an uncertainty of \u0394E1, and E2 has \u0394E2. The energy difference between E2 and E1 is \u0394E = E2 - E1. To have them not overlap, \u0394E must be greater than \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. Because if \u0394E is less than the sum, there's an overlap.\n\nSo in this case, the sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = approximately 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than about 7.2e-7 eV. Let's look at the options:\n\nOption C: 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. That's 1e4 times larger than 7.2e-7 eV. So it's way bigger than needed.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV = 0.00000001 eV. That's way smaller than 7.2e-7. So that's not enough.\n\nSo the only option that's larger than the required 7.2e-7 eV is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the numbers.\n\nWait, \u0127 is approximately 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\n\u03c41 = 1e-9 s \u2192 \u0394E1 = 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV.\n\n\u03c42 = 1e-8 s \u2192 \u0394E2 = 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than that.\n\nLooking at options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 \u2192 0.001 \u03bceV \u2192 way too small.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 10,000 times larger than 7.238e-7. So that's way more than enough.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.1e-7 eV \u2192 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is 0.1e-7 = 0.1 * 1e-7 = 1e-8. So 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is 1e-8 eV. That's much less than 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo only option C is larger than the required sum. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV\n\nB) 1e-11 eV\n\nC) 1e-4 eV\n\nD) 1e-8 eV\n\nSo, only option C meets the condition that the energy difference is larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference option allows us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that you can't precisely measure both the energy and the lifetime (or rather, the time) of a particle simultaneously. The more precisely you know one, the less you know about the other.\n\nThe formula I think is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, sometimes the equation is written with an approximate sign because it's an uncertainty principle, not an exact equation. So, the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval (lifetime) should be on the order of \u0127.\n\nWait, \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s. But since the options are in electron volts (eV), I should probably convert \u0127 into eV\u00b7s. Let me think about that.\n\nI know that 1 eV is 1.602176634 \u00d7 10^-19 joules. So, \u0127 in eV\u00b7s would be:\n\n\u0127 \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) \u2248 (1.0545718e-34) / (1.602e-19) eV\u00b7s.\n\nLet me compute that roughly. 1e-34 divided by 1e-19 is 1e-15. So, 1.05e-34 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s. So \u0127 \u2248 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nNow, the uncertainty principle says \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. So, the energy uncertainty \u0394E is approximately \u0127/(2\u0394t). But wait, the lifetimes given are for the two states. Hmm, but when we talk about resolving two energy levels, the time over which we're measuring is probably the same as the lifetimes, right? Or maybe it's the time we have to make the measurement.\n\nWait, I think when trying to distinguish two states, the energy resolution depends on the time over which you can make the measurement. Like, if you have a short lifetime, you can't resolve small energy differences because the uncertainty in energy is large.\n\nSo, the minimum energy difference that can be resolved should be on the order of \u0127 divided by the lifetime. So, \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For each state, the energy uncertainty is about \u0127 divided by the lifetime. So, for state 1, \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / (1e-9 s), and state 2, \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127 / (1e-8 s).\n\nWait, no, I think it's the other way around. A longer lifetime means a smaller energy uncertainty because \u0394E is inversely proportional to \u0394t. So, for the first state, which has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s), the energy uncertainty is larger than the second state (1e-8 s), which has a longer lifetime and thus smaller \u0394E.\n\nSo, the energy resolution depends on the minimum detectable difference. To clearly distinguish the two states, the energy difference between E2 and E1 (\u0394E) must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, perhaps? Or at least larger than the larger uncertainty.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimum detectable \u0394E is determined by the smaller of the two uncertainties. Because if one has a much larger uncertainty, you might not be able to resolve a small difference.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose you have two states, one with a short lifetime (so large \u0394E) and another with a longer lifetime (smaller \u0394E). The energy difference must be bigger than the larger of the two \u0394E's so that you can tell them apart.\n\nWait, for example, if state 1 has \u0394E1 = 1e-7 eV, and state 2 has \u0394E2 = 1e-8 eV. If the actual energy difference between E2 and E1 is 1e-7 eV, which is larger than both individual uncertainties, then you can distinguish them. But if the difference is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than \u0394E1, you can't tell them apart because the uncertainty of state 1 is larger than the difference.\n\nSo, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think more accurately. When you have two states, each with their own energy uncertainties, the ability to distinguish them depends on whether the separation between their energies is larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the separation is smaller than the sum, the two states might overlap in their probability distributions, making them indistinguishable.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the separation should be greater than the individual uncertainties. Let me think of an example. Suppose state 1 has E1 with uncertainty \u0394E1, and state 2 has E2 with uncertainty \u0394E2. The energy difference is \u0394E = E2 - E1. For them to be distinguishable, \u0394E must be greater than \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. Because if \u0394E were less than that sum, the two energy intervals might overlap, making it impossible to tell which state you're in.\n\nBut wait, I'm not certain. I think it's more likely that the energy difference must be greater than the individual uncertainties. Because if \u0394E is larger than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, you can tell them apart. Because each state's energy is known within a certain range, and if the difference is bigger than the possible overlaps, you can distinguish.\n\nWait, let me think about the energy levels. If the energy levels are E1 \u00b1 \u0394E1 and E2 \u00b1 \u0394E2. If E2 - E1 > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, then the two intervals don't overlap, so you can distinguish them. But if E2 - E1 is less than or equal to \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, then the intervals might overlap, making it impossible to distinguish.\n\nSo, the condition for clear distinction is \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nSo, we need to compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u0394E1.\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / (\u0394t1) = (6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127 / (\u0394t2) = (6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (1e-8 s) = 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 is 6.58e-7 eV, \u0394E2 is 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo, the sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 \u2248 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo, the energy difference \u0394E between E2 and E1 must be greater than about 7.2e-7 eV for them to be clearly resolved.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV\n\nB) 1e-11 eV\n\nC) 1e-4 eV\n\nD) 1e-8 eV.\n\nWait, wait a second. 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 7.2e-7. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than 7.2e-7. So that would satisfy the condition. But the other options are smaller than 7.2e-7, except option C.\n\nWait, but wait. Did I miscalculate the exponents?\n\nWait, 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s divided by 1e-9 s is 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV. Yes.\n\nSimilarly, 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 is 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo, sum is 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo, the energy difference must be greater than 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 7.2e-7. So that's much bigger. So that would work.\n\nBut wait, let me check the other options. Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7.2e-7 eV (which is 0.00000072 eV). So 1e-8 is smaller than 7.2e-7, so that wouldn't be enough.\n\nWait, but wait. If the energy difference is exactly equal to the sum of the uncertainties, then it's just barely distinguishable, but in reality, it's safer to have it larger. So any option larger than 7.2e-7 eV would be acceptable.\n\nLooking at the options, only option C is larger than that. The others are smaller.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option C, 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because I'm using the sum of the uncertainties as the threshold. But perhaps the correct approach is to consider the maximum of the two uncertainties, not the sum.\n\nWait, because each state has its own uncertainty. So, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states won't overlap.\n\nWait, let me think: if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the intervals don't overlap. Because the lower energy state's upper bound is E1 + \u0394E1, and the higher energy state's lower bound is E2 - \u0394E2. If E2 - (E1 + \u0394E1) > 0, then they don't overlap.\n\nSo, E2 - E1 > \u0394E1.\n\nIn this case, \u0394E1 is 6.58e-7 eV. So, if the energy difference is larger than 6.58e-7 eV, then E2 - E1 > \u0394E1, so E2 - (E1 + \u0394E1) = (E2 - E1) - \u0394E1 > 0.\n\nWait, so the condition is \u0394E > \u0394E1.\n\nBecause \u0394E1 is larger than \u0394E2 (since \u0394E1 is 6.58e-7 and \u0394E2 is 6.58e-8).\n\nSo, the energy difference must be greater than \u0394E1, which is 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSo, looking at the options, which option is larger than 6.58e-7 eV?\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 = 1e4 * 1e-8 = 10000 * 1e-8. 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. Which is 1e-4 = 10000e-8, which is way larger than 6.58e-7 (which is 0.658e-6, or 658e-8).\n\nSo, 1e-4 eV is 100e-6 eV, which is 100 * 1e-6 = 1e-4.\n\nWait, 1e-4 is larger than 6.58e-7. So yes, option C would work.\n\nBut wait, what about option D, which is 1e-8 eV. That's smaller than 6.58e-7. So it's too small.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is about clearly distinguishing the two energy levels. So if the energy difference is just a little above 6.58e-7 eV, it's distinguishable. So the options have to have an energy difference larger than that.\n\nLooking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger. So the correct answer is option C.\n",

So, 1.05e-34 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s. So \u0127 \u2248 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nNow, the uncertainty principle says \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. So, the energy uncertainty \u0394E is approximately \u0127/(2\u0394t). But wait, the lifetimes given are for the two states.

A longer lifetime means a smaller energy uncertainty because \u0394E is inversely proportional to \u0394t.

The energy difference must be bigger than the larger of the two \u0394E's so that you can tell them apart.\n\nWait, for example, if state 1 has \u0394E1 = 1e-7 eV, and state 2 has \u0394E2 = 1e-8 eV. If the actual energy difference between E2 and E1 is 1e-7 eV, which is larger than both individual uncertainties, then you can distinguish them. But if the difference is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than \u0394E1, you can't tell them apart because the uncertainty of state 1 is larger than the difference.\n\nSo, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think more accurately. When you have two states, each with their own energy uncertainties, the ability to distinguish them depends on whether the separation between their energies is larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the separation is smaller than the sum, the two states might overlap in their probability distributions, making them indistinguishable.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the separation should be greater than the individual uncertainties. Let me think of an example. Suppose state 1 has E1 with uncertainty \u0394E1, and state 2 has E2 with uncertainty \u0394E2. The energy difference is \u0394E = E2 - E1. For them to be distinguishable, \u0394E must be greater than \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. Because if \u0394E were less than that sum, the two energy intervals might overlap, making it impossible to tell which state you're in.\n\nBut wait, I'm not certain. I think it's more likely that the energy difference must be greater than the individual uncertainties. Because if \u0394E is larger than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, you can tell them apart. Because each state's energy is known within a certain range, and if the difference is bigger than the possible overlaps, you can distinguish.\n\nWait, let me think about the energy levels. If the energy levels are E1 \u00b1 \u0394E1 and E2 \u00b1 \u0394E2. If E2 - E1 > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, then the two intervals don't overlap, so you can distinguish them. But if E2 - E1 is less than or equal to \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, then the intervals might overlap, making it impossible to distinguish.\n\nSo, the condition for clear distinction is \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nSo, we need to compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u0394E1.\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / (\u0394t1) = (6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127 / (\u0394t2) = (6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (1e-8 s) = 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 is 6.58e-7 eV, \u0394E2 is 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo, the sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 \u2248 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo, the energy difference \u0394E between E2 and E1 must be greater than about 7.2e-7 eV for them to be clearly resolved.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV\n\nB) 1e-11 eV\n\nC) 1e-4 eV\n\nD) 1e-8 eV.\n\nWait, wait a second. 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 7.2e-7. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than 7.2e-7. So that would satisfy the condition. But the other options are smaller than 7.2e-7, except option C.\n\nWait, but wait. Did I miscalculate the exponents?\n\nWait, 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s divided by 1e-9 s is 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV. Yes.\n\nSimilarly, 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 is 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo, sum is 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo, the energy difference must be greater than 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 7.2e-7. So that's much bigger. So that would work.\n\nBut wait, let me check the other options. Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7.2e-7 eV (which is 0.00000072 eV). So 1e-8 is smaller than 7.2e-7, so that wouldn't be enough.\n\nWait, but wait. If the energy difference is exactly equal to the sum of the uncertainties, then it's just barely distinguishable, but in reality, it's safer to have it larger. So any option larger than 7.2e-7 eV would be acceptable.\n\nLooking at the options, only option C is larger than that. The others are smaller.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option C, 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because I'm using the sum of the uncertainties as the threshold. But perhaps the correct approach is to consider the maximum of the two uncertainties, not the sum.\n\nWait, because each state has its own uncertainty. So, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states won't overlap.\n\nWait, let me think: if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the intervals don't overlap. Because the lower energy state's upper bound is E1 + \u0394E1, and the higher energy state's lower bound is E2 - \u0394E2. If E2 - (E1 + \u0394E1) > 0, then they don't overlap.\n\nSo, E2 - E1 > \u0394E1.\n\nIn this case, \u0394E1 is 6.58e-7 eV. So, if the energy difference is larger than 6.58e-7 eV, then E2 - E1 > \u0394E1, so E2 - (E1 + \u0394E1) = (E2 - E1) - \u0394E1 > 0.\n\nWait, so the condition is \u0394E > \u0394E1.\n\nBecause \u0394E1 is larger than \u0394E2 (since \u0394E1 is 6.58e-7 and \u0394E2 is 6.58e-8).\n\nSo, the energy difference must be greater than \u0394E1, which is 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSo, looking at the options, which option is larger than 6.58e-7 eV?\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 = 1e4 * 1e-8 = 10000 * 1e-8. 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. Which is 1e-4 = 10000e-8, which is way larger than 6.58e-7 (which is 0.658e-6, or 658e-8).\n\nSo, 1e-4 eV is 100e-6 eV, which is 100 * 1e-6 = 1e-4.\n\nWait, 1e-4 is larger than 6.58e-7. So yes, option C would work.\n\nBut wait, what about option D, which is 1e-8 eV. That's smaller than 6.58e-7. So it's too small.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is about clearly distinguishing the two energy levels. So if the energy difference is just a little above 6.58e-7 eV, it's distinguishable. So the options have to have an energy difference larger than that.\n\nLooking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger. So the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine which energy difference allows the two quantum states to be clearly distinguished, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{2},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hbar \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{eV\u00b7s} \\). The energy uncertainty \\( \\Delta E \\) for each state is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta t}.\n\\]\n\nFor the first state with a lifetime \\( \\Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \\, \\text{s} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{6.58 \\times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.58 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\nFor the second state with a lifetime \\( \\Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \\, \\text{s} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{6.58 \\times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.58 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\nTo clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \\( \\Delta E \\) between the two states must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties, \\( \\Delta E_1 \\), which is \\( 6.58 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\). This ensures that the energy intervals for the two states do not overlap, allowing them to be resolved.\n\nNow, we compare the given options:\n\n- **Option A: \\( 10^{-9} \\, \\text{eV} \\)**  \n  This is smaller than \\( 6.58 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\), so it is insufficient.\n\n- **Option B: \\( 10^{-11} \\, \\text{eV} \\)**  \n  This is also smaller than \\( 6.58 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\), so it is insufficient.\n\n- **Option C: \\( 10^{-4} \\, \\text{eV} \\)**  \n  This is much larger than \\( 6.58 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\), so it satisfies the condition.\n\n- **Option D: \\( 10^{-8} \\, \\text{eV} \\)**  \n  This is smaller than \\( 6.58 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\), so it is insufficient.\n\nThe only option that satisfies the condition for clear distinction is **Option C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step. \n\nThe question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The formula I think is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. \n\nWait, so \u0394t here is the lifetime of the state, right? So for each energy level, we can calculate the uncertainty in energy. The energy difference between the two states should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, I guess, so that they can be resolved distinctly.\n\nLet me write down the formula. The uncertainty in energy \u0394E is approximately \u0127 divided by twice the lifetime \u03c4. So \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c4). \n\nBut wait, \u0127 is a known constant. I think \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s. Oh, but the options are in electron volts, so I need to convert units.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602\u00d710^-19 joules. So, I can express \u0127 in terms of eV\u00b7s. Let me calculate that. \n\n\u0127 \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. Converting to eV\u00b7s: since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so \u0127 \u2248 (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c4). Let's compute \u0394E for each state.\n\nFor E1, \u03c41 is 1e-9 sec. So \u0394E1 = 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV. So approximately 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nFor E2, \u03c42 is 1e-8 sec. So \u0394E2 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) ) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) ) = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 1e-8 is 10^-8, so 2e-8 is 2 * 1e-8. Let me recalculate.\n\n\u0394E1 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) \u2192 denominator is 2e-9 \u2192 so 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 \u2192 3.291e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) ) \u2192 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-8 \u2192 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainties are about 3.29e-7 eV for E1, and 3.29e-8 eV for E2.\n\nTo distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. So \u0394E_total = \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nSo \u0394E_total = 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The energy difference between E2 and E1 is |E2 - E1|. To resolve them, this difference must be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties because each state has its own uncertainty. So the total uncertainty is the sum of the two. Therefore, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the individual \u0394E's.\n\nSo let me compute the sum: 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than approximately 3.6e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-7, which is way smaller than 3.6e-7. So too small.\n\nOption B: 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller. No.\n\nOption C: 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 3.6e-7. So that's way bigger than needed. So the energy difference would be clearly resolved.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.1e-7 eV. 0.1e-7 is less than 3.6e-7. So not enough.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check again. Because the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So if the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty, they can be resolved.\n\nSo if the energy difference is much larger than the sum of the uncertainties, then it's resolvable. So the sum of the uncertainties is 3.6e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than that.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e4 * 1e-8. So 1e-4 eV is 10,000 times larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So that's definitely larger. So option C would allow clear distinction.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think again: the lifetimes are given, and the uncertainty in energy is for each state. So the energy difference between the two must be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties to be distinguishable.\n\nSo the minimum required energy difference is when it's just above the sum. So any option where the energy difference is larger than that sum is acceptable.\n\nSo in the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 3.6e-7 eV. The others are smaller.\n\nWait, but let me check the numbers again. Because 3.6e-7 eV is 3.6 * 10^-7 eV. 1e-4 eV is 10^-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. So 1e-4 is 100 times larger than 1e-6, which is way more than needed.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might have mixed up the calculation. Let me double-check the calculation of the uncertainties.\n\nWait, the formula is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c4). So for E1, \u03c4=1e-9 s.\n\n\u0394E1 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) \u2192 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for E2, \u03c4=1e-8 s. So \u0394E2 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) ) = 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nSo sum is 3.291e-7 + 3.291e-8 = (3.291 + 0.3291) e-7 \u2192 3.6201e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than 3.62e-7 eV.\n\nLooking back, the options:\n\nA: 1e-9 \u2192 0.001e-7 \u2192 1e-9 is 0.000000001, which is way smaller.\n\nB: 1e-11 \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC: 1e-4 \u2192 0.0001 \u2192 which is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 3.62e-7.\n\nD: 1e-8 \u2192 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8 eV. 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, so 0.1 times the sum.\n\nWait, so 0.1e-7 is less than 3.6e-7. So option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.1e-7. So the sum is 3.6e-7. So option D is 0.1e-7, which is less than the sum. So the energy difference would be less than the sum, so they can't be distinguished.\n\nWait, but wait: the sum is 3.6e-7, so the energy difference has to be larger than that. So for the energy difference to be clearly resolved, it must be significantly larger than the sum of the uncertainties.\n\nSo, which of the options is larger than 3.6e-7 eV?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 10,000 times larger. So that's sufficient.\n\nOptions A, B, D are all smaller than the required 3.6e-7. So the only option that meets the condition is option C.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the relation between energy difference and time of flight. Or, perhaps, the energy resolution is determined by the product of the energy difference and the time. Hmm, I might be mixing up things. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference needs to be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, but I think it's the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be greater than the individual uncertainties. But I think the correct approach is that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties to ensure they are distinguishable. Because each state's energy has its own uncertainty, and the total uncertainty in their separation is the sum.\n\nSo, yeah, I think option C is the correct answer.\n",

Let's compute \u0394E for each state.\n\nFor E1, \u03c41 is 1e-9 sec. So \u0394E1 = 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV. So approximately 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nFor E2, \u03c42 is 1e-8 sec. So \u0394E2 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) ) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) ) = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 1e-8 is 10^-8, so 2e-8 is 2 * 1e-8. Let me recalculate.\n\n\u0394E1 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) \u2192 denominator is 2e-9 \u2192 so 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 \u2192 3.291e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) ) \u2192 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-8 \u2192 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainties are about 3.29e-7 eV for E1, and 3.29e-8 eV for E2.\n\nTo distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. So \u0394E_total = \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nSo \u0394E_total = 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The energy difference between E2 and E1 is |E2 - E1|. To resolve them, this difference must be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties because each state has its own uncertainty. So the total uncertainty is the sum of the two. Therefore, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the individual \u0394E's.\n\nSo let me compute the sum: 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than approximately 3.6e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-7, which is way smaller than 3.6e-7. So too small.\n\nOption B: 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller. No.\n\nOption C: 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 3.6e-7. So that's way bigger than needed. So the energy difference would be clearly resolved.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.1e-7 eV. 0.1e-7 is less than 3.6e-7. So not enough.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check again. Because the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So if the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty, they can be resolved.\n\nSo if the energy difference is much larger than the sum of the uncertainties, then it's resolvable. So the sum of the uncertainties is 3.6e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than that.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e4 * 1e-8. So 1e-4 eV is 10,000 times larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So that's definitely larger. So option C would allow clear distinction.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think again: the lifetimes are given, and the uncertainty in energy is for each state. So the energy difference between the two must be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties to be distinguishable.\n\nSo the minimum required energy difference is when it's just above the sum. So any option where the energy difference is larger than that sum is acceptable.\n\nSo in the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 3.6e-7 eV. The others are smaller.\n\nWait, but let me check the numbers again. Because 3.6e-7 eV is 3.6 * 10^-7 eV. 1e-4 eV is 10^-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. So 1e-4 is 100 times larger than 1e-6, which is way more than needed.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might have mixed up the calculation. Let me double-check the calculation of the uncertainties.\n\nWait, the formula is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c4). So for E1, \u03c4=1e-9 s.\n\n\u0394E1 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) \u2192 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for E2, \u03c4=1e-8 s. So \u0394E2 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) ) = 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nSo sum is 3.291e-7 + 3.291e-8 = (3.291 + 0.3291) e-7 \u2192 3.6201e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than 3.62e-7 eV.\n\nLooking back, the options:\n\nA: 1e-9 \u2192 0.001e-7 \u2192 1e-9 is 0.000000001, which is way smaller.\n\nB: 1e-11 \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC: 1e-4 \u2192 0.0001 \u2192 which is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 3.62e-7.\n\nD: 1e-8 \u2192 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8 eV. 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, so 0.1 times the sum.\n\nWait, so 0.1e-7 is less than 3.6e-7. So option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.1e-7. So the sum is 3.6e-7. So option D is 0.1e-7, which is less than the sum. So the energy difference would be less than the sum, so they can't be distinguished.\n\nWait, but wait: the sum is 3.6e-7, so the energy difference has to be larger than that. So for the energy difference to be clearly resolved, it must be significantly larger than the sum of the uncertainties.\n\nSo, which of the options is larger than 3.6e-7 eV?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 10,000 times larger. So that's sufficient.\n\nOptions A, B, D are all smaller than the required 3.6e-7. So the only option that meets the condition is option C.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the relation between energy difference and time of flight. Or, perhaps, the energy resolution is determined by the product of the energy difference and the time. Hmm, I might be mixing up things. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference needs to be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, but I think it's the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be greater than the individual uncertainties. But I think the correct approach is that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties to ensure they are distinguishable. Because each state's energy has its own uncertainty, and the total uncertainty in their separation is the sum.\n\nSo, yeah, I think option C is the correct answer.\n\n\nTo determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\\( \\Delta E \\)) to the lifetime (\\( \\tau \\)) of the state:  \n\n\\[\n\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\tau}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately \\( 6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{eV\u00b7s} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.\n\nThe question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D, each with different eV values.\n\nHmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state relates to the uncertainty in energy. Oh right, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle comes into play here. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) and the uncertainty in time (\u0394t) is approximately equal to \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant.\n\nWait, but how does that help us here? The lifetimes given are the times for which the states exist before decaying, I think. So the uncertainty in time \u0394t for each state would be roughly the lifetime itself. But wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. For a state that lives for a certain time, the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to that time. So if a state has a longer lifetime, the energy uncertainty is smaller.\n\nSo, the energy uncertainty \u0394E is approximately \u0127 divided by the lifetime \u03c4. The formula is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4. Let me write that down: \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4.\n\nBut wait, I should remember that \u0127 is about 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. Oh, but the options are in eV, so I need to convert units. Alternatively, maybe there's a handy approximation that 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 joules. So maybe I can calculate \u0394E for each state and then figure out the minimum energy difference needed.\n\nWait, but the problem is about distinguishing two energy levels. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Otherwise, they wouldn't be resolvable.\n\nWait, but each state has its own uncertainty. Hmm, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Or maybe the maximum of the two? Or perhaps each state's uncertainty sets a lower bound for the detectable difference.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the energy resolution. To clearly distinguish two states, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy of each state. So if the uncertainty for each state is \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, then the difference \u0394E = |E2 - E1| should be greater than the maximum of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.\n\nEach state's energy has an uncertainty. If the energies are too close, their uncertainties might overlap, making it hard to distinguish them. So the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps just each's uncertainty?\n\nWait, wait. Let me get the formula right. The uncertainty principle is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. Here, \u0394t is the time over which the energy is measured. For a state with a lifetime \u03c4, \u0394t is about \u03c4. So \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c4).\n\nSo for the first state, E1, the uncertainty is \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u03c41), and similarly \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u03c42).\n\nWe want the energy difference between E2 and E1 to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of them individually? Because if the energy difference is larger than each uncertainty, then it would definitely be distinguishable.\n\nWait, let's think about it. Suppose the two energy levels are E1 and E2. The uncertainty in E1 is \u0394E1, and the uncertainty in E2 is \u0394E2. To distinguish them, the separation between E2 and E1, which is \u0394E = E2 - E1, must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. Because if the separation is larger than either uncertainty, it's more likely to be resolved.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the energy resolution. The minimum detectable energy difference is about the uncertainty. So to resolve two states, the difference must be larger than the uncertainty. But which uncertainty?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is bigger than the larger uncertainty, it should be resolvable.\n\nWait, let's calculate the uncertainties first. Let me compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nGiven:\n\n\u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds\n\n\u03c42 = 1e-8 seconds\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2 * \u03c41)\n\u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(2 * \u03c42)\n\nBut since \u03c42 is larger than \u03c41, \u0394E2 will be smaller than \u0394E1. Because as lifetime increases, the energy uncertainty decreases.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 is larger than \u0394E2.\n\nSo, the maximum uncertainty is \u0394E1.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference \u0394E between E2 and E1 must be greater than \u0394E1. Because if \u0394E is larger than \u0394E1, then it's resolvable.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me plug in the numbers.\n\nCalculate \u0394E1 and \u0394E2 in eV.\n\nGiven \u0127 \u2248 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\n1 eV = 1.6e-19 J.\n\nSo, let's compute \u0394E1:\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / (2 * \u03c41) = (1.05e-34 J\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.25e-26 J.\n\nConvert J to eV: 5.25e-26 J * (1 eV / 1.6e-19 J) \u2248 3.28e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2 \u03c42) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.6e-19 = approx 3.28e-8 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 is approximately 3.28e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 is about 3.28e-8 eV.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check my calculation again. Wait, \u03c41 is 1e-9, so 1e-9 seconds.\n\nSo \u0127/(2 \u03c41) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-9 = 5.25e-26 J.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 5.25e-26 J is 5.25e-26 / 1.6e-19 eV \u2248 3.28e-7 eV. So approximately 3.28e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c42 is 1e-8 s.\n\nSo \u0127/(2 \u03c42) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J. 5.25e-27 / 1.6e-19 = 3.28e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainties are about 3.28e-7 eV and 3.28e-8 eV.\n\nSo the maximum uncertainty is 3.28e-7 eV (\u0394E1). So to distinguish E2 and E1, the energy difference must be larger than this maximum uncertainty.\n\nSo looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 1e-9 eV \u2192 1e-9 eV is 0.001 n eV. That's way smaller than 3.28e-7 eV. So no, can't be distinguished.\n\nOption B: 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller, so no.\n\nOption C: 1e-4 eV \u2192 that's 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That's way larger than 3.28e-7 eV. So this would be resolvable.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV \u2192 which is 10^-8 eV. That's 1e-8 eV. But wait, our maximum uncertainty is 3.28e-7 eV, which is 3.28e-7 eV = 0.328e-6 eV. So 1e-8 eV is 1e-8 = 0.01e-6 eV. So 0.01e-6 is much less than 0.328e-6. So the energy difference of 1e-8 eV is smaller than the uncertainty. So not resolvable.\n\nWait, but wait. The energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps the individual uncertainties. Hmm, because each state has its own uncertainty. So the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because if it's just larger than one, but not the other, perhaps they could overlap.\n\nWait, let me think. The energy levels are E1 and E2. The uncertainty for E1 is \u0394E1, and for E2 it's \u0394E2. So the actual energy of E1 could be anywhere in [E1 - \u0394E1/2, E1 + \u0394E1/2], and similarly for E2. So the two intervals would be [E1 - \u0394E1/2, E1 + \u0394E1/2] and [E2 - \u0394E2/2, E2 + \u0394E2/2].\n\nTo avoid overlapping, the lower end of E2's interval must be higher than the upper end of E1's interval. So E2 - \u0394E2/2 > E1 + \u0394E1/2.\n\nSo the difference E2 - E1 must be greater than (\u0394E1/2 + \u0394E2/2) = (\u0394E1 + \u0394E2)/2.\n\nAlternatively, since \u0394E1 is larger than \u0394E2, this sum is roughly \u0394E1/2 + something smaller. So the minimum required difference would be approximately \u0394E1.\n\nBut wait, in our earlier calculation, the required \u0394E is about 3.28e-7 eV.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That's 1e-4 = 10^-4 eV. 3.28e-7 is 3.28e-7 = 0.000328 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV. Wait, wait no, 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is larger than 0.000328 eV? No, wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is smaller than 0.000328 (which is 3.28e-4).\n\nWait, wait, no. 3.28e-7 is 0.000000328 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3.28e-7 eV.\n\nSo option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than the required 3.28e-7 eV. So that would be resolvable.\n\nOption D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is much less than 3.28e-7 eV. So not resolvable.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I think I made a mistake in the calculation of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nWait, \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s. Oh wait, that's a useful number. Because \u0127 in eV\u00b7s is approximately 6.582e-16.\n\nBecause 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so \u0127 in J\u00b7s is 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. So 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s = 1.05e-34 / (1.6e-19) eV\u00b7s \u2248 6.56e-16 eV\u00b7s. So approximately 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4.\n\nSo, for E1, \u0394E1 \u2248 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s / (1e-9 s) )= 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 \u2248 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo, that's 6.58e-7 eV for E1 and 6.58e-8 eV for E2.\n\nSo the maximum uncertainty is 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than this.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 6.58e-7 is 0.000000658 eV. So 0.0001 is larger than 0.000000658, so yes, option C's energy difference is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.000000001 eV \u2192 way too small.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 larger than 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.00000001 eV \u2192 smaller than 6.58e-7.\n\nSo the correct answer must be option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.\n\nThe question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D, each with different eV values.\n\nHmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state relates to the uncertainty in energy. Oh right, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle comes into play here. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) and the uncertainty in time (\u0394t) is approximately equal to \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant.\n\nWait, but how does that help us here? The lifetimes given are the times for which the states exist before decaying, I think. So the uncertainty in time \u0394t for each state would be roughly the lifetime itself. But wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. For a state that lives for a certain time, the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to that time. So if a state has a longer lifetime, the energy uncertainty is smaller.\n\nSo, the energy uncertainty \u0394E is approximately \u0127 divided by the lifetime \u03c4. The formula is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4. Let me write that down: \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4.\n\nBut wait, I should remember that \u0127 is about 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. Oh, but the options are in eV, so I need to convert units. Alternatively, maybe there's a handy approximation that 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 joules. So maybe I can calculate \u0394E for each state and then figure out the minimum energy difference needed.\n\nWait, but the problem is about distinguishing two energy levels. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Otherwise, they wouldn't be resolvable.\n\nWait, but each state has its own uncertainty. Hmm, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Or maybe the maximum of the two? Or perhaps each state's uncertainty sets a lower bound for the detectable difference.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the energy resolution. To clearly distinguish two states, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy of each state. So if the uncertainty for each state is \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, then the difference \u0394E = |E2 - E1| should be greater than the maximum of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.\n\nEach state's energy has an uncertainty. If the energies are too close, their uncertainties might overlap, making it hard to distinguish them. So the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps just each's uncertainty?\n\nWait, wait. Let me get the formula right. The uncertainty principle is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. Here, \u0394t is the time over which the energy is measured. For a state with a lifetime \u03c4, \u0394t is about \u03c4. So \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c4).\n\nSo for the first state, E1, the uncertainty is \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u03c41), and similarly \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u03c42).\n\nWe want the energy difference between E2 and E1 to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of them individually? Because if the energy difference is larger than each uncertainty, then it would definitely be distinguishable.\n\nWait, let's think about it. Suppose the two energy levels are E1 and E2. The uncertainty in E1 is \u0394E1, and the uncertainty in E2 is \u0394E2. To distinguish them, the separation between E2 and E1, which is \u0394E = E2 - E1, must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. Because if the separation is larger than either uncertainty, it's more likely to be resolved.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the energy resolution. The minimum detectable energy difference is about the uncertainty. So to resolve two states, the difference must be larger than the uncertainty. But which uncertainty?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is bigger than the larger uncertainty, it should be resolvable.\n\nWait, let's calculate the uncertainties first. Let me compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nGiven:\n\n\u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds\n\n\u03c42 = 1e-8 seconds\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2 * \u03c41)\n\u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(2 * \u03c42)\n\nBut since \u03c42 is larger than \u03c41, \u0394E2 will be smaller than \u0394E1. Because as lifetime increases, the energy uncertainty decreases.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 is larger than \u0394E2.\n\nSo, the maximum uncertainty is \u0394E1.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference \u0394E between E2 and E1 must be greater than \u0394E1. Because if \u0394E is larger than \u0394E1, then it's resolvable.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me plug in the numbers.\n\nCalculate \u0394E1 and \u0394E2 in eV.\n\nGiven \u0127 \u2248 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\n1 eV = 1.6e-19 J.\n\nSo, let's compute \u0394E1:\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / (2 * \u03c41) = (1.05e-34 J\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.25e-26 J.\n\nConvert J to eV: 5.25e-26 J * (1 eV / 1.6e-19 J) \u2248 3.28e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2 \u03c42) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.6e-19 = approx 3.28e-8 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 is approximately 3.28e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 is about 3.28e-8 eV.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check my calculation again. Wait, \u03c41 is 1e-9, so 1e-9 seconds.\n\nSo \u0127/(2 \u03c41) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-9 = 5.25e-26 J.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 5.25e-26 J is 5.25e-26 / 1.6e-19 eV \u2248 3.28e-7 eV. So approximately 3.28e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c42 is 1e-8 s.\n\nSo \u0127/(2 \u03c42) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J. 5.25e-27 / 1.6e-19 = 3.28e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainties are about 3.28e-7 eV and 3.28e-8 eV.\n\nSo the maximum uncertainty is 3.28e-7 eV (\u0394E1). So to distinguish E2 and E1, the energy difference must be larger than this maximum uncertainty.\n\nSo looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 1e-9 eV \u2192 1e-9 eV is 0.001 n eV. That's way smaller than 3.28e-7 eV. So no, can't be distinguished.\n\nOption B: 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller, so no.\n\nOption C: 1e-4 eV \u2192 that's 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That's way larger than 3.28e-7 eV. So this would be resolvable.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV \u2192 which is 10^-8 eV. That's 1e-8 eV. But wait, our maximum uncertainty is 3.28e-7 eV, which is 3.28e-7 eV = 0.328e-6 eV. So 1e-8 eV is 1e-8 = 0.01e-6 eV. So 0.01e-6 is much less than 0.328e-6. So the energy difference of 1e-8 eV is smaller than the uncertainty. So not resolvable.\n\nWait, but wait. The energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps the individual uncertainties. Hmm, because each state has its own uncertainty. So the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because if it's just larger than one, but not the other, perhaps they could overlap.\n\nWait, let me think. The energy levels are E1 and E2. The uncertainty for E1 is \u0394E1, and for E2 it's \u0394E2. So the actual energy of E1 could be anywhere in [E1 - \u0394E1/2, E1 + \u0394E1/2], and similarly for E2. So the two intervals would be [E1 - \u0394E1/2, E1 + \u0394E1/2] and [E2 - \u0394E2/2, E2 + \u0394E2/2].\n\nTo avoid overlapping, the lower end of E2's interval must be higher than the upper end of E1's interval. So E2 - \u0394E2/2 > E1 + \u0394E1/2.\n\nSo the difference E2 - E1 must be greater than (\u0394E1/2 + \u0394E2/2) = (\u0394E1 + \u0394E2)/2.\n\nAlternatively, since \u0394E1 is larger than \u0394E2, this sum is roughly \u0394E1/2 + something smaller. So the minimum required difference would be approximately \u0394E1.\n\nBut wait, in our earlier calculation, the required \u0394E is about 3.28e-7 eV.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That's 1e-4 = 10^-4 eV. 3.28e-7 is 3.28e-7 = 0.000328 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV. Wait, wait no, 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is larger than 0.000328 eV? No, wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is smaller than 0.000328 (which is 3.28e-4).\n\nWait, wait, no. 3.28e-7 is 0.000000328 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3.28e-7 eV.\n\nSo option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than the required 3.28e-7 eV. So that would be resolvable.\n\nOption D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is much less than 3.28e-7 eV. So not resolvable.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I think I made a mistake in the calculation of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nWait, \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s. Oh wait, that's a useful number. Because \u0127 in eV\u00b7s is approximately 6.582e-16.\n\nBecause 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so \u0127 in J\u00b7s is 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. So 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s = 1.05e-34 / (1.6e-19) eV\u00b7s \u2248 6.56e-16 eV\u00b7s. So approximately 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4.\n\nSo, for E1, \u0394E1 \u2248 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s / (1e-9 s) )= 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 \u2248 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo, that's 6.58e-7 eV for E1 and 6.58e-8 eV for E2.\n\nSo the maximum uncertainty is 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than this.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 6.58e-7 is 0.000000658 eV. So 0.0001 is larger than 0.000000658, so yes, option C's energy difference is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.000000001 eV \u2192 way too small.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 larger than 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.00000001 eV \u2192 smaller than 6.58e-7.\n\nSo the correct answer must be option C.\n\n\nTo distinguish two quantum states with energies \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\), the energy difference \\( \\Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \\) must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. The energy uncertainty for a state is determined by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck's constant (\\( \\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{eV\u00b7s} \\)) and \\( \\tau \\) is the lifetime of the state.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: Two quantum states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which of the options is their energy difference so that they can be resolved?\n\nHmm, right. I remember that the uncertainty principle comes into play here. Oh wait, yes, the energy-time uncertainty principle. The formula is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. So the uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is roughly on the order of \u0127.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. But when we're trying to distinguish between two states, we're looking at the energy difference between them, right?\n\nI think the idea is that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy, which depends on the lifetime of each state. Wait, but which lifetime do we use? Oh wait, perhaps we need to consider the time over which the system is observed. Because when you have a system that can transition between states, the time it's observed affects the uncertainty.\n\nWait, but in this case, each state has its own lifetime. So maybe the time for each is given. Let me think. The energy-time uncertainty principle says that the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) is inversely proportional to the uncertainty in time (\u0394t). So \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / (\u0394t). But in this problem, each state has a certain lifetime, which is like the \u0394t for each.\n\nWait, but we're looking to distinguish between the two energy levels, so the energy difference \u0394E between E2 and E1 should be larger than the uncertainty in energy, which is determined by the measurement time. Or perhaps the maximum uncertainty in energy is determined by the shortest lifetime, because a shorter lifetime (so less time to measure) would give a larger uncertainty.\n\nWait, let me think again. The uncertainty principle is \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. So for a state with a shorter lifetime, the uncertainty in energy would be larger. So if the two states have different lifetimes, which one determines the uncertainty when measuring the energy difference?\n\nAlternatively, maybe when you're trying to measure the energy difference between two states, the time you're measuring is the time you observe each state. But I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that the energy difference \u0394E needs to be greater than the uncertainty in energy due to the measurement time. The measurement time would be on the order of the time it takes for the system to transition, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, another approach. The energy difference \u0394E must be such that when multiplied by the time, the product is greater than \u0127. Because if \u0394E * T is much larger than \u0127, then the states can be distinguished. Because if the energy difference is too small, then over time T, the phase difference might not build up enough.\n\nWait, but maybe it's more about the Fourier transform and the resolution in energy. The energy resolution is determined by the time of measurement. The longer you measure, the better the energy resolution (smaller \u0394E you can detect). So, in this problem, what's the maximum \u0394E that can be distinguished?\n\nWait, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy, which is given by \u0127/(\u0394t), where \u0394t is the time over which the measurement is made. But in this case, the measurement time would be related to the lifetimes of the states. Hmm.\n\nWait, the lifetimes \u03c41 and \u03c42 are given as 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. So which one is relevant for the uncertainty?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time available for distinguishing the two states is the minimum of the two lifetimes. Because once either state decays, you can't observe both anymore. So the measurement time would be on the order of \u03c4 = min(\u03c41, \u03c42) = 1e-9 seconds.\n\nSo the uncertainty in energy would be \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s. So \u0394E \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.\n\nSo, the energy difference between the two states must be greater than this to be distinguishable. So \u0394E > ~6.58e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, let's see:\n\nOption A: 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 eV \u2192 1e-9 eV is way smaller than 6.5e-7 eV. So that's too small.\n\nOption B: 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller. Not possible.\n\nOption C: 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 much larger than 6.5e-7 eV. So this would be distinguishable.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.01e-6 eV \u2192 1e-8 eV is smaller than 6.5e-7 eV. So D is also too small.\n\nWait, but wait, the calculation I did assumed that the measurement time is the minimum of the lifetimes, which is 1e-9 seconds. But is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relevant time is the time over which the system is observed, which might be longer. Or maybe the time is the time it takes for the system to evolve, which might be the same as the time the system is in a particular state before it decays.\n\nWait, another approach. The lifetime of a state is the average time before it decays. So if you have two states with different lifetimes, the longer-lived state will have a smaller energy uncertainty. But how does that affect the energy difference between them?\n\nWait, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/\u03c41 and \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/\u03c42. So for \u03c41 = 1e-9 s, \u0394E1 \u2248 6.5e-7 eV. For \u03c42 = 1e-8 s, \u0394E2 \u2248 6.5e-8 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference between the two states must be greater than the sum of these uncertainties? Or perhaps the larger uncertainty is the main factor.\n\nWait, but the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for the system to be able to resolve the two states.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: Two quantum states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which of the options is their energy difference so that they can be resolved?\n\nHmm, right. I remember that the uncertainty principle comes into play here. Oh wait, yes, the energy-time uncertainty principle. The formula is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. So the uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is roughly on the order of \u0127.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. But when we're trying to distinguish between two states, we're looking at the energy difference between them, right?\n\nI think the idea is that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy, which depends on the lifetime of each state. Wait, but which lifetime do we use? Oh wait, perhaps we need to consider the time over which the system is observed. Because when you have a system that can transition between states, the time it's observed affects the uncertainty.\n\nWait, but in this case, each state has its own lifetime. So maybe the time for each is given. Let me think. The energy-time uncertainty principle says that the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) is inversely proportional to the uncertainty in time (\u0394t). So \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / (\u0394t). But in this problem, each state has a certain lifetime, which is like the \u0394t for each.\n\nWait, but we're looking to distinguish between the two energy levels, so the energy difference \u0394E between E2 and E1 should be larger than the uncertainty in energy, which is determined by the measurement time. Or perhaps the maximum uncertainty in energy is determined by the shortest lifetime, because a shorter lifetime (so less time to measure) would give a larger uncertainty.\n\nWait, let me think again. The uncertainty principle is \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. So for a state with a shorter lifetime, the uncertainty in energy would be larger. So if the two states have different lifetimes, which one determines the uncertainty when measuring the energy difference?\n\nAlternatively, maybe when you're trying to measure the energy difference between two states, the time you're measuring is the time you observe each state. But I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that the energy difference \u0394E needs to be greater than the uncertainty in energy due to the measurement time. The measurement time would be on the order of the time it takes for the system to transition, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, another approach. The energy difference \u0394E must be such that when multiplied by the time, the product is greater than \u0127. Because if \u0394E * T is much larger than \u0127, then the states can be distinguished. Because if the energy difference is too small, then over time T, the phase difference might not build up enough.\n\nWait, but maybe it's more about the Fourier transform and the resolution in energy. The energy resolution is determined by the time of measurement. The longer you measure, the better the energy resolution (smaller \u0394E you can detect). So, in this problem, what's the maximum \u0394E that can be distinguished?\n\nWait, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy, which is given by \u0127/(\u0394t), where \u0394t is the time over which the measurement is made. But in this case, the measurement time would be related to the lifetimes of the states. Hmm.\n\nWait, the lifetimes \u03c41 and \u03c42 are given as 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. So which one is relevant for the uncertainty?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time available for distinguishing the two states is the minimum of the two lifetimes. Because once either state decays, you can't observe both anymore. So the measurement time would be on the order of \u03c4 = min(\u03c41, \u03c42) = 1e-9 seconds.\n\nSo the uncertainty in energy would be \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s. So \u0394E \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.\n\nSo, the energy difference between the two states must be greater than this to be distinguishable. So \u0394E > ~6.58e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, let's see:\n\nOption A: 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 eV \u2192 1e-9 eV is way smaller than 6.5e-7 eV. So that's too small.\n\nOption B: 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller. Not possible.\n\nOption C: 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 much larger than 6.5e-7 eV. So this would be distinguishable.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.01e-6 eV \u2192 1e-8 eV is smaller than 6.5e-7 eV. So D is also too small.\n\nWait, but wait, the calculation I did assumed that the measurement time is the minimum of the lifetimes, which is 1e-9 seconds. But is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relevant time is the time over which the system is observed, which might be longer. Or maybe the time is the time it takes for the system to evolve, which might be the same as the time the system is in a particular state before it decays.\n\nWait, another approach. The lifetime of a state is the average time before it decays. So if you have two states with different lifetimes, the longer-lived state will have a smaller energy uncertainty. But how does that affect the energy difference between them?\n\nWait, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/\u03c41 and \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/\u03c42. So for \u03c41 = 1e-9 s, \u0394E1 \u2248 6.5e-7 eV. For \u03c42 = 1e-8 s, \u0394E2 \u2248 6.5e-8 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference between the two states must be greater than the sum of these uncertainties? Or perhaps the larger uncertainty is the main factor.\n\nWait, but the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for the system to be able to resolve the two states. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.\n\nSo the uncertainty in the energy measurement is dominated by the state with the shorter lifetime, which is \u03c41 = 1e-9 s, leading to \u0394E \u2248 6.5e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than this. Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 6.5e-7 eV.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state is related to its energy uncertainty. Oh right, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle! The principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is on the order of Planck's constant divided by 2\u03c0. So, \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2\u03c0. Wait, or is it just \u0127? I think the exact form is \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2, or sometimes it's approximated as \u0127. But for the purposes of this problem, maybe it's sufficient to use \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(\u0394t), where \u0394t is the lifetime of the state.\n\nWait, but wait. The states have different lifetimes. So for each state, their energy uncertainty would be based on their own lifetimes. So the state with a shorter lifetime (1e-9 sec) has a larger energy uncertainty, and the longer-lived state has a smaller uncertainty.\n\nSo to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the lines would overlap and you wouldn't be able to distinguish them.\n\nRight, so the energy difference \u0394E should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Let me write that down.\n\n\u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nEach \u0394E is approximately \u0127 divided by the lifetime. So,\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c41,\n\u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c42.\n\nSo the sum is \u0127 (1/\u03c41 + 1/\u03c42).\n\nLet me compute that. The lifetimes are \u03c41=1e-9 s and \u03c42=1e-8 s.\n\nSo 1/\u03c41 is 1e9 s^-1, and 1/\u03c42 is 1e8 s^-1. Adding them gives 1.1e9 s^-1.\n\nSo \u0394E should be greater than \u0127 * 1.1e9.\n\nWait, what's \u0127? Planck's constant over 2\u03c0. \u0127 \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo plugging in:\n\n\u0394E \u2248 (1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s) * (1.1e9 s^-1) \u2248 1.159e-25 J.\n\nBut wait, the options are in electron volts (eV). I need to convert Joules to eV.\n\nI remember that 1 eV \u2248 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E \u2248 1.159e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 approximately 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nWait, that's 7.24e-7 eV, which is 0.724 microeV. Looking at the options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV or 100 microeV. That's much larger than what I just calculated. So the required \u0394E should be around 7.2e-7 eV. But none of the options match that exactly.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute each \u0394E separately and then sum them.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 = (1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05457e-25 J.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127 / \u03c42 = (1.05457e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.05457e-26 J.\n\nSo the sum is 1.05457e-25 + 1.05457e-26 = approximately 1.16e-25 J.\n\nThen, converting to eV:\n\n1.16e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 7.24e-7 eV, as before.\n\nSo the energy difference \u0394E must be larger than approximately 7.2e-7 eV, which is 0.72e-6 eV or 7.2e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001 n eV \u2192 too small.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 1e-4 eV is much larger than 7.2e-7 eV.\n\nWait, 7.2e-7 is 0.72e-6, which is 0.00000072 eV. Option C is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. So 1e-4 is 100 times larger than 1e-6. So the required \u0394E is about 7e-7, which is 0.7e-6 eV. So option C is way larger than needed.\n\nWait, but the question is asking which option could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. So the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. So the smallest possible option that is larger than 7.2e-7 eV would be the correct choice.\n\nBut looking at the options, the smallest option that's larger than 7.2e-7 is C, which is 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV.\n\nWait, 7.2e-7 eV is 0.00000072 eV, which is 7.2e-7 eV.\n\nSo 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 100e-6, which is much bigger than 7.2e-7. So the energy difference must be larger than 7.2e-7 eV. So any option larger than that would suffice.\n\nWait, but let me see the options again:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001 meV \u2192 1e-9 eV is 0.000000001 eV \u2192 way too small.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 that's 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.00000001 eV \u2192 1e-8 eV.\n\nSo the sum we calculated is 7.2e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that. So the options are:\n\nWhich option is larger than 7.2e-7 eV?\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. Which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, 7.2e-7 eV is 0.00000072 eV. So 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 100 times larger. So option C is larger, which would allow clear distinction.\n\nBut wait, option D is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than 7.2e-7. So D is 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8 eV, which is less than 7.2e-7 eV. So D is too small.\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than required.\n\nSo the correct answer must be option C, because it's the only one that's larger than the required 7.2e-7 eV.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again about the uncertainty. The formula I used is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4. But actually, I think the standard formula is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / (2 \u03c4). Or is it \u0127/(\u03c0 \u03c4) or something else?\n\nOh wait, the uncertainty principle is \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. So if \u0394t is the lifetime \u03c4, then \u0394E \u2265 \u0127/(2 \u03c4).\n\nSo, perhaps I should have used \u0394E = \u0127/(2 \u03c4) instead of \u0127/\u03c4.\n\nAh, right! I think I made a mistake there. Because the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2, so the minimal \u0394E is \u0127/(2\u0394t). So the earlier calculation should have been divided by 2.\n\nSo let's recalculate.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(2 \u03c41) = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ) \u2248 5.27e-26 J.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127/(2 \u03c42) = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) ) \u2248 5.27e-26 J / 10 = 5.27e-26 J * 0.5? Wait, no.\n\nWait, \u03c41 is 1e-9, \u03c42 is 1e-8.\n\nSo \u03c42 is 10 times \u03c41.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(2 * 1e-9) = 1.05457e-34 / 2e-9 = 5.27e-26 J.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127/(2 * 1e-8) = 1.05457e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.27e-27 J.\n\nSo the sum is 5.27e-26 + 5.27e-27 = 5.8e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV:\n\n5.8e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 3.62e-7 eV.\n\nSo the required \u0394E must be greater than 3.62e-7 eV.\n\nSo, 3.62e-7 eV is about 0.362e-6 eV or 362 microeV.\n\nLooking at the options, which one is larger than 3.62e-7 eV.\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV. 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. So 0.0001 is way bigger.\n\nWait, but wait, the question says \"could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved.\" So any \u0394E larger than the sum will do. So the minimum possible would be just over 3.6e-7, but the options don't have anything that small.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 \u2192 0.000000001 eV \u2192 1e-9 eV.\n\nB) 1e-11 \u2192 0.00000000001 eV.\n\nC) 1e-4 \u2192 0.0001 eV.\n\nD) 1e-8 \u2192 0.00000001 eV.\n\nSo the only option larger than 3.6e-7 is C, 1e-4 eV.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state is related to its energy uncertainty. Oh right, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle! The principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is on the order of Planck's constant divided by 2\u03c0. So, \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2\u03c0. Wait, or is it just \u0127? I think the exact form is \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2, or sometimes it's approximated as \u0127. But for the purposes of this problem, maybe it's sufficient to use \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(\u0394t), where \u0394t is the lifetime of the state.\n\nWait, but wait. The states have different lifetimes. So for each state, their energy uncertainty would be based on their own lifetimes. So the state with a shorter lifetime (1e-9 sec) has a larger energy uncertainty, and the longer-lived state has a smaller uncertainty.\n\nSo to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the lines would overlap and you wouldn't be able to distinguish them.\n\nRight, so the energy difference \u0394E should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Let me write that down.\n\n\u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nEach \u0394E is approximately \u0127 divided by the lifetime. So,\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c41,\n\u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c42.\n\nSo the sum is \u0127 (1/\u03c41 + 1/\u03c42).\n\nLet me compute that. The lifetimes are \u03c41=1e-9 s and \u03c42=1e-8 s.\n\nSo 1/\u03c41 is 1e9 s^-1, and 1/\u03c42 is 1e8 s^-1. Adding them gives 1.1e9 s^-1.\n\nSo \u0394E should be greater than \u0127 * 1.1e9.\n\nWait, what's \u0127? Planck's constant over 2\u03c0. \u0127 \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo plugging in:\n\n\u0394E \u2248 (1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s) * (1.1e9 s^-1) \u2248 1.159e-25 J.\n\nBut wait, the options are in electron volts (eV). I need to convert Joules to eV.\n\nI remember that 1 eV \u2248 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E \u2248 1.159e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 approximately 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nWait, that's 7.24e-7 eV, which is 0.724 microeV. Looking at the options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV or 100 microeV. That's much larger than what I just calculated. So the required \u0394E should be around 7.2e-7 eV. But none of the options match that exactly.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute each \u0394E separately and then sum them.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 = (1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05457e-25 J.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127 / \u03c42 = (1.05457e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.05457e-26 J.\n\nSo the sum is 1.05457e-25 + 1.05457e-26 = approximately 1.16e-25 J.\n\nThen, converting to eV:\n\n1.16e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 7.24e-7 eV, as before.\n\nSo the energy difference \u0394E must be larger than approximately 7.2e-7 eV, which is 0.72e-6 eV or 7.2e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001 n eV \u2192 too small.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 1e-4 eV is much larger than 7.2e-7 eV.\n\nWait, 7.2e-7 is 0.72e-6, which is 0.00000072 eV. Option C is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. So 1e-4 is 100 times larger than 1e-6. So the required \u0394E is about 7e-7, which is 0.7e-6 eV. So option C is way larger than needed.\n\nWait, but the question is asking which option could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. So the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. So the smallest possible option that is larger than 7.2e-7 eV would be the correct choice.\n\nBut looking at the options, the smallest option that's larger than 7.2e-7 is C, which is 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV.\n\nWait, 7.2e-7 eV is 0.00000072 eV, which is 7.2e-7 eV.\n\nSo 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 100e-6, which is much bigger than 7.2e-7. So the energy difference must be larger than 7.2e-7 eV. So any option larger than that would suffice.\n\nWait, but let me see the options again:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001 meV \u2192 1e-9 eV is 0.000000001 eV \u2192 way too small.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 that's 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.00000001 eV \u2192 1e-8 eV.\n\nSo the sum we calculated is 7.2e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that. So the options are:\n\nWhich option is larger than 7.2e-7 eV?\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. Which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, 7.2e-7 eV is 0.00000072 eV. So 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 100 times larger. So option C is larger, which would allow clear distinction.\n\nBut wait, option D is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than 7.2e-7. So D is 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8 eV, which is less than 7.2e-7 eV. So D is too small.\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than required.\n\nSo the correct answer must be option C, because it's the only one that's larger than the required 7.2e-7 eV.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again about the uncertainty. The formula I used is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4. But actually, I think the standard formula is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / (2 \u03c4). Or is it \u0127/(\u03c0 \u03c4) or something else?\n\nOh wait, the uncertainty principle is \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. So if \u0394t is the lifetime \u03c4, then \u0394E \u2265 \u0127/(2 \u03c4).\n\nSo, perhaps I should have used \u0394E = \u0127/(2 \u03c4) instead of \u0127/\u03c4.\n\nAh, right! I think I made a mistake there. Because the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2, so the minimal \u0394E is \u0127/(2\u0394t). So the earlier calculation should have been divided by 2.\n\nSo let's recalculate.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(2 \u03c41) = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ) \u2248 5.27e-26 J.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127/(2 \u03c42) = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) ) \u2248 5.27e-26 J / 10 = 5.27e-26 J * 0.5? Wait, no.\n\nWait, \u03c41 is 1e-9, \u03c42 is 1e-8.\n\nSo \u03c42 is 10 times \u03c41.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(2 * 1e-9) = 1.05457e-34 / 2e-9 = 5.27e-26 J.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127/(2 * 1e-8) = 1.05457e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.27e-27 J.\n\nSo the sum is 5.27e-26 + 5.27e-27 = 5.8e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV:\n\n5.8e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 3.62e-7 eV.\n\nSo the required \u0394E must be greater than 3.62e-7 eV.\n\nSo, 3.62e-7 eV is about 0.362e-6 eV or 362 microeV.\n\nLooking at the options, which one is larger than 3.62e-7 eV.\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV. 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. So 0.0001 is way bigger.\n\nWait, but wait, the question says \"could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved.\" So any \u0394E larger than the sum will do. So the minimum possible would be just over 3.6e-7, but the options don't have anything that small.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 \u2192 0.000000001 eV \u2192 1e-9 eV.\n\nB) 1e-11 \u2192 0.00000000001 eV.\n\nC) 1e-4 \u2192 0.0001 eV.\n\nD) 1e-8 \u2192 0.00000001 eV.\n\nSo the only option larger than 3.6e-7 is C, 1e-4 eV. So the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the energy difference between two quantum states with lifetimes \\( \\tau_1 = 10^{-9} \\, \\text{s} \\) and \\( \\tau_2 = 10^{-8} \\, \\text{s} \\) that allows them to be clearly resolved, we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E \\Delta t \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.\n\\]\n\nFor each state, the energy uncertainty is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\tau_1}, \\quad \\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\tau_2}.\n\\]\n\nThe total uncertainty in energy is the sum of the individual uncertainties:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values of \\( \\tau_1 \\) and \\( \\tau_2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\tau_1} = \\frac{1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s}}{2 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{s}} = 5.27 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{J},\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta E_2 = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\tau_2} = \\frac{1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s}}{2 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{s}} = 5.27 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{J}.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_{\\text{total}} = 5.27 \\times 10^{-26} + 5.27 \\times 10^{-27} = 5.8 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{J}.\n\\]\n\nConverting \\( \\Delta E_{\\text{total}} \\) to electron volts (\\( 1 \\, \\text{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{5.8 \\times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 3.62 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\nTo resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \\( \\Delta E \\) must be greater than \\( \\Delta E_{\\text{total}} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states and whether we can distinguish them clearly.\n\nAlright, the problem says we have two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference so that we can clearly resolve these two levels. The options are A to D.\n\nWait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The principle states that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. So, the product of the energy uncertainty and the lifetime (time uncertainty) can't be too small.\n\nWait, but wait. The lifetime here refers to the lifetime of the state. So, the uncertainty in the lifetime is roughly the lifetime itself. So, the energy uncertainty \u0394E is approximately \u0127 divided by the lifetime.\n\nThe formula I think is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4, where \u03c4 is the lifetime. So, for each state, we can find the energy uncertainty.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. To resolve them clearly, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, right? Because if the energy difference is too small, the two states might not be distinguishable due to their energy uncertainties overlapping.\n\nSo, let's compute the energy uncertainty for each state. Let me get the numbers right. The lifetimes are \u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds and \u03c42 = 1e-8 seconds.\n\nThe reduced Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo, calculating \u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 = (1.0545718e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nWait, but we need the energy in eV. Oh right, because the options are in eV. Let me convert J to eV.\n\nI remember that 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 J. So, to convert from J to eV, I divide by that number.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 in eV is 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV \u2248 approximately 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me do the exact calculation.\n\nWait, 1.0545718e-34 divided by 1e-9 is 1.0545718e-25 J. Divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV.\n\nSo 1.0545718e-25 / 1.602e-19 = (1.0545718 / 1.602) ) * 1e-6. Let me compute 1.0545718 / 1.602.\n\n1.0545718 / 1.602 is approximately 0.658. So 0.658e-6 eV, which is 6.58e-7 eV. So about 6.58e-7 eV for \u0394E1.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 would be \u0127 / \u03c42. \u03c42 is 1e-8 seconds.\n\n\u0394E2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.0545718e-26 / 1.602e-19 = (1.0545718 / 1.602) ) * 1e-7 \u2248 0.658e-7 eV = 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo, the energy uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV for the two states.\n\nNow, to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between E2 and E1 (assuming E2 > E1) should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the peaks (if we're talking about emission lines, for example) might overlap, making them indistinguishable.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. Because each state has its own uncertainty, the minimal difference to resolve them would be when the energy difference is about the order of the inverse of the longer lifetime. Or wait, perhaps I should think about the combined uncertainty.\n\nWait, the combined uncertainty would be the sum of the two individual uncertainties. So, \u0394E_total = \u0394E1 + \u0394E2 \u2248 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo, the energy difference should be greater than this total uncertainty for them to be distinguishable.\n\nLooking at the options, let's see:\n\nOption A: 1e-9 eV.

So yes, this would be resolvable.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV. Wait, 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is 0.01e-6. Our required is about 0.72e-6. So 0.01e-6 is smaller than 0.72e-6. So option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01e-6, which is less than 0.72e-6. So not enough.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me check the numbers again.\n\n\u0394E1 is about 6.58e-7 eV (\u2248 0.658e-6 eV), and \u0394E2 is about 6.58e-8 eV (\u2248 0.0658e-6 eV).

So yes, this would be resolvable.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.01e-6 \u2192 which is less than 0.72e-6, so not enough.\n\nSo the correct option is C) 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The energy difference is the difference between E2 and E1. Suppose E2 > E1, so \u0394E = E2 - E1. We need \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nBut let me think about the exact formula. The uncertainty principle gives a lower bound on the detectability. So the energy difference must be at least on the order of \u0127/(minimum time resolution). But in this case, the time resolution would be related to the lifetimes of the states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time resolution is determined by the longer of the two lifetimes. Hmm. Let me think.\n\nWait, when you're measuring the energy levels, the time you can measure is limited by the lifetimes of the states. The energy resolution is then given by \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/\u03c4, where \u03c4 is the order of the time measurement. But if the two states have different lifetimes, perhaps you take the smaller \u03c4 because the shorter lifetime gives a larger energy uncertainty, which would be the limiting factor.\n\nWait, let me think. If the states have different lifetimes, which one determines the energy uncertainty? Well, the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger energy uncertainty. So the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the two energy uncertainties.\n\nWait, but perhaps in practice, the measurement can't resolve the difference if the energy difference is smaller than the sum of the two uncertainties. So for E1 and E2, their uncertainties are \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, so the minimal detectable difference is \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nSo, the energy difference must be greater than that sum. So, in this case, the sum is approximately 7.238e-7 eV, which is about 7.24e-7 eV. So any energy difference larger than that would be resolvable.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 7.24e-7 eV. So that's sufficient.\n\nWait, but let me compute the exact value again to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nLet me compute \u0394E1:\n\n\u03c41 = 1e-9 s.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo, 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.0545718 / 1.602) ) * 1e-6 eV.\n\n1.0545718 / 1.602 \u2248 0.658.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 \u2248 0.658e-6 eV = 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c42 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.0545718e-26 / 1.602e-19 = (1.0545718 / 1.602) ) * 1e-7 \u2248 0.658e-7 eV = 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo sum \u0394E1 + \u0394E2 = 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference \u0394E must be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. That's 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 * 1e6 micro-eV = 1e2 micro-eV. Wait, wait, no, let me convert 1e-4 eV into eV.\n\nWait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That's way larger than 7.24e-7 eV (which is 0.000000724 eV). So 1e-4 eV is about 138 times larger than 7.24e-7 eV. So it's way above the needed threshold. So option C is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, let's look at option D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8 eV. Wait, 1e-8 eV is 0.01e-6 eV, which is 0.01e-6. Our threshold is 0.724e-6, so 0.01e-6 is way below that. So option D is not enough.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states and whether we can distinguish them clearly.\n\nAlright, the problem says we have two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference so that we can clearly resolve these two levels. The options are A to D.\n\nWait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The principle states that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. So, the product of the energy uncertainty and the lifetime (time uncertainty) can't be too small.\n\nWait, but wait. The lifetime here refers to the lifetime of the state. So, the uncertainty in the lifetime is roughly the lifetime itself. So, the energy uncertainty \u0394E is approximately \u0127 divided by the lifetime.\n\nThe formula I think is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4, where \u03c4 is the lifetime. So, for each state, we can find the energy uncertainty.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. To resolve them clearly, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, right? Because if the energy difference is too small, the two states might not be distinguishable due to their energy uncertainties overlapping.\n\nSo, let's compute the energy uncertainty for each state. Let me get the numbers right. The lifetimes are \u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds and \u03c42 = 1e-8 seconds.\n\nThe reduced Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo, calculating \u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 = (1.0545718e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nWait, but we need the energy in eV. Oh right, because the options are in eV. Let me convert J to eV.\n\nI remember that 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 J. So, to convert from J to eV, I divide by that number.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 in eV is 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV \u2248 approximately 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me do the exact calculation.\n\nWait, 1.0545718e-34 divided by 1e-9 is 1.0545718e-25 J. Divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV.\n\nSo 1.0545718e-25 / 1.602e-19 = (1.0545718 / 1.602) ) * 1e-6. Let me compute 1.0545718 / 1.602.\n\n1.0545718 / 1.602 is approximately 0.658. So 0.658e-6 eV, which is 6.58e-7 eV. So about 6.58e-7 eV for \u0394E1.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 would be \u0127 / \u03c42. \u03c42 is 1e-8 seconds.\n\n\u0394E2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.0545718e-26 / 1.602e-19 = (1.0545718 / 1.602) ) * 1e-7 \u2248 0.658e-7 eV = 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo, the energy uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV for the two states.\n\nNow, to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between E2 and E1 (assuming E2 > E1) should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the peaks (if we're talking about emission lines, for example) might overlap, making them indistinguishable.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. Because each state has its own uncertainty, the minimal difference to resolve them would be when the energy difference is about the order of the inverse of the longer lifetime. Or wait, perhaps I should think about the combined uncertainty.\n\nWait, the combined uncertainty would be the sum of the two individual uncertainties. So, \u0394E_total = \u0394E1 + \u0394E2 \u2248 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo, the energy difference should be greater than this total uncertainty for them to be distinguishable.\n\nLooking at the options, let's see:\n\nOption A: 1e-9 eV. That's 0.001e-6 eV. Way smaller than 7e-7 eV. So no.\n\nOption B: 1e-11 eV. Even smaller. No.\n\nOption C: 1e-4 eV. That's 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 7e-7. So yes, this would be resolvable.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV. Wait, 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is 0.01e-6. Our required is about 0.72e-6. So 0.01e-6 is smaller than 0.72e-6. So option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01e-6, which is less than 0.72e-6. So not enough.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me check the numbers again.\n\n\u0394E1 is about 6.58e-7 eV (\u2248 0.658e-6 eV), and \u0394E2 is about 6.58e-8 eV (\u2248 0.0658e-6 eV). So sum is approximately 0.723e-6 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than 0.723e-6 eV.\n\nLooking at options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 \u2192 no.\n\nB) 1e-11 \u2192 0.000001e-6 \u2192 no.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.1e-3 \u2192 which is 1e-4 eV. That's 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 100e-6 eV. Which is way larger than 0.72e-6. So yes, this would be resolvable.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.01e-6 \u2192 which is less than 0.72e-6, so not enough.\n\nSo the correct option is C) 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The energy difference is the difference between E2 and E1. Suppose E2 > E1, so \u0394E = E2 - E1. We need \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nBut let me think about the exact formula. The uncertainty principle gives a lower bound on the detectability. So the energy difference must be at least on the order of \u0127/(minimum time resolution). But in this case, the time resolution would be related to the lifetimes of the states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time resolution is determined by the longer of the two lifetimes. Hmm. Let me think.\n\nWait, when you're measuring the energy levels, the time you can measure is limited by the lifetimes of the states. The energy resolution is then given by \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/\u03c4, where \u03c4 is the order of the time measurement. But if the two states have different lifetimes, perhaps you take the smaller \u03c4 because the shorter lifetime gives a larger energy uncertainty, which would be the limiting factor.\n\nWait, let me think. If the states have different lifetimes, which one determines the energy uncertainty? Well, the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger energy uncertainty. So the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the two energy uncertainties.\n\nWait, but perhaps in practice, the measurement can't resolve the difference if the energy difference is smaller than the sum of the two uncertainties. So for E1 and E2, their uncertainties are \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, so the minimal detectable difference is \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nSo, the energy difference must be greater than that sum. So, in this case, the sum is approximately 7.238e-7 eV, which is about 7.24e-7 eV. So any energy difference larger than that would be resolvable.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 7.24e-7 eV. So that's sufficient.\n\nWait, but let me compute the exact value again to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nLet me compute \u0394E1:\n\n\u03c41 = 1e-9 s.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo, 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.0545718 / 1.602) ) * 1e-6 eV.\n\n1.0545718 / 1.602 \u2248 0.658.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 \u2248 0.658e-6 eV = 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c42 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.0545718e-26 / 1.602e-19 = (1.0545718 / 1.602) ) * 1e-7 \u2248 0.658e-7 eV = 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo sum \u0394E1 + \u0394E2 = 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference \u0394E must be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. That's 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 * 1e6 micro-eV = 1e2 micro-eV. Wait, wait, no, let me convert 1e-4 eV into eV.\n\nWait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That's way larger than 7.24e-7 eV (which is 0.000000724 eV). So 1e-4 eV is about 138 times larger than 7.24e-7 eV. So it's way above the needed threshold. So option C is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, let's look at option D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8 eV. Wait, 1e-8 eV is 0.01e-6 eV, which is 0.01e-6.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.\n\nThe question says we have two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between the two energy levels. The options are A to D.\n\nWait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with lifetimes and energy measurements. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It relates the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) and the uncertainty in time (\u0394t). The formula is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, sometimes it's written as \u0394E\u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2, but for estimation purposes, the approximate equality holds.\n\nSo, the energy uncertainty should be at least on the order of \u0127 divided by the lifetime. Because the lifetime is the time during which the energy is measured, right? So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is roughly \u0127 divided by the lifetime.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about distinguishing two energy levels. So the energy difference between them should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each, perhaps? Or maybe each uncertainty? I'm a bit confused here.\n\nLet me think. Each state has its own lifetime. The first has a lifetime of \u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds, the second \u03c42 = 1e-8 seconds. The uncertainty in energy for each would be \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c41) and \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c42). But wait, in reality, when you're trying to measure the energy difference between two states, the uncertainty in the energy difference would be related to the product of the lifetimes or something else?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The energy difference is E2 - E1. To distinguish them, the difference should be larger than the combined uncertainty. Hmm, but the combined uncertainty would be the uncertainty in E2 plus the uncertainty in E1. Because the energy difference has an uncertainty that's the sum of each's uncertainty? Or is it the other way around?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each energy has its own uncertainty, and the difference would have an uncertainty of the order of \u0127 divided by the average of the lifetimes? Or perhaps the minimum uncertainty for the energy difference is \u0127 divided by the minimum of the lifetimes. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nLet me try another approach. The energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty principle. So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy is \u0394E = \u0127/(2\u03c4), where \u03c4 is the lifetime. So, for the first state, \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2 * 1e-9) and the second state, \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2 * 1e-8). \n\nBut when considering the energy difference between the two, the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two. Hmm, because if you're measuring both energies, the total uncertainty in the difference would be the square root of the sum of squares, assuming the uncertainties are independent. But since they're independent, perhaps the total uncertainty in E2 - E1 would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ). But maybe that's complicating it too much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the energy difference should be much larger than the uncertainty in each energy. So for the energy difference to be resolvable, \u0394(E2 - E1) should be greater than the sum of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty in the energy difference, which would be the same as the uncertainty in the measurement of the energy difference. But I'm not sure how that's calculated.\n\nWait, another thought. If you have two states with lifetimes \u03c41 and \u03c42, the energy difference \u0394E = E2 - E1 must be such that it's larger than the uncertainty in \u0394E. The uncertainty in \u0394E would be related to the lifetimes somehow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference is determined by the minimum of the lifetimes. Because the energy difference can be measured by the frequency of oscillations, which depends on the shorter lifetime. Or maybe it's the longer lifetime that dominates the uncertainty. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me try plugging in the numbers. Let's compute the uncertainties for each energy.\n\nThe reduced Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But since the options are in eV, maybe I should convert it to eV\u00b7s.\n\n1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So, 1 eV\u00b7s = 1.602e-19 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo, \u0127 \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) * (1 eV\u00b7s / 1.602e-19 J\u00b7s) ) \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nNow, compute \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u03c41) = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) eV = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 eV \u2248 3.291e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u03c42) = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-8 s) ) = 6.582e-16/(2e-8) = 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 \u2248 3.291e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 \u2248 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nWait, so the uncertainties are 3.291e-7 eV and 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nNow, the energy difference between E2 and E1 is \u0394E = E2 - E1. To distinguish them, this \u0394E must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in E1 and E2. Because when you measure E1 and E2, each has its own uncertainty, so the difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be resolvable.\n\nWait, is that the case? Because the maximum possible uncertainty in \u0394E would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ) if the uncertainties are independent. But maybe in this case, since we're looking for a clear distinction, we need the energy difference to be larger than each individual uncertainty.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then it's definitely distinguishable.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose E1 is 100 eV with an uncertainty of 1 eV, and E2 is 101 eV with an uncertainty of 0.5 eV. Then the difference is 1 eV. The uncertainty in the difference would be sqrt(1^2 + 0.5^2) \u2248 1.118 eV. So the difference is 1 eV, which is less than the uncertainty, so they wouldn't be distinguishable.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. Or perhaps the sum is not the right approach. Maybe the correct approach is that the energy difference should be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then it's definitely resolvable.\n\nWait, let me think again. The energy difference \u0394E = E2 - E1. The uncertainty in \u0394E is the uncertainty in E2 plus the uncertainty in E1, assuming they are independent. Wait, no, if E1 and E2 are independent measurements, the uncertainty in \u0394E would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ). But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps it's considered that the uncertainty in \u0394E is the sum, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in each energy. So, \u0394E > \u0394E1 and \u0394E > \u0394E2. So the energy difference must be larger than both individual uncertainties.\n\nIn that case, \u0394E must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties, which is \u0394E1 = 3.291e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be more than 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 3.29e-7 eV. So option C would satisfy.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV\n\nB) 1e-11 eV\n\nC) 1e-4 eV\n\nD) 1e-8 eV\n\nSo option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3.29e-7 eV. So that would allow clear distinction.\n\nBut wait, the lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8. The first state has a shorter lifetime, leading to a larger energy uncertainty. So the energy difference needs to be bigger than that larger uncertainty.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be an energy difference larger than 3.29e-7 eV. The only option that is larger is C, 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but looking at the numbers: 1e-4 is 1e-4, and 3.29e-7 is 0.000329e-4. So 1e-4 is about 3000 times larger than the required. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, the correct choice should have the energy difference larger than the uncertainty. So, the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but another thought: the energy difference is measured as the frequency difference in a transition. The uncertainty in the frequency would be inversely proportional to the measurement time. Hmm, but perhaps I'm complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the energy difference \u0394E corresponds to a frequency \u0394f = \u0394E/h. The lifetime \u03c4 is related to the uncertainty in frequency \u0394f \u2248 1/\u03c4. So, \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 (1/\u03c4). So, to resolve two levels, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty, which is about \u0127/\u03c4.\n\nWait, but for each state, the uncertainty is \u0127/(2\u03c4). So, for the two states, the uncertainties are \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c41) and \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c42). To resolve E1 and E2, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. So \u0394E = E2 - E1 > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nLet me calculate \u0394E1 + \u0394E2:\n\n\u0394E1 = 3.29e-7 eV,\n\n\u0394E2 = 3.29e-8 eV,\n\nSum = 3.619e-7 eV.\n\nSo, the energy difference must be larger than 3.6e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger, so it's acceptable.\n\nThe other options are all smaller than this sum. Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is much smaller than 3.6e-7 eV, so it's not acceptable.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.\n\nThe question says we have two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between the two energy levels. The options are A to D.\n\nWait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with lifetimes and energy measurements. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It relates the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) and the uncertainty in time (\u0394t). The formula is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, sometimes it's written as \u0394E\u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2, but for estimation purposes, the approximate equality holds.\n\nSo, the energy uncertainty should be at least on the order of \u0127 divided by the lifetime. Because the lifetime is the time during which the energy is measured, right? So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is roughly \u0127 divided by the lifetime.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about distinguishing two energy levels. So the energy difference between them should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each, perhaps? Or maybe each uncertainty? I'm a bit confused here.\n\nLet me think. Each state has its own lifetime. The first has a lifetime of \u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds, the second \u03c42 = 1e-8 seconds. The uncertainty in energy for each would be \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c41) and \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c42). But wait, in reality, when you're trying to measure the energy difference between two states, the uncertainty in the energy difference would be related to the product of the lifetimes or something else?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The energy difference is E2 - E1. To distinguish them, the difference should be larger than the combined uncertainty. Hmm, but the combined uncertainty would be the uncertainty in E2 plus the uncertainty in E1. Because the energy difference has an uncertainty that's the sum of each's uncertainty?
