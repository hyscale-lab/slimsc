      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT).\n\nWait, each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are three spins. That means there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I should probably list all these states and calculate the energy for each one, then sum the exponentials.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a smarter way to do this without listing all 8. Since the energy depends on the products of pairs, perhaps I can find the number of states that have a certain number of aligned pairs.\n\nLet me think: Each term S_i S_j is +1 if the spins are aligned (same) and -1 if anti-aligned (different). So the total energy is -J multiplied by the sum of these terms.\n\nSo E = -J (sum of all pairs). Let me compute the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nEach term is either +1 or -1. So S can be 3, 1, -1, or -3, depending on how many pairs are aligned.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think about possible values for S. The sum S can be:\n\nIf all three are aligned, meaning all S_i are the same. Then each pair product is 1, so S = 3.\n\nIf two pairs are aligned and one isn't. Wait, but can that happen? Let's see: suppose S1 and S2 are aligned, S1 and S3 are aligned. Then S2 and S3 must also be aligned, right? Because if S1 and S2 are same, and S1 and S3 are same, then S2 and S3 must be same. So the only possibilities are either all three aligned, two aligned and one opposite (but wait, that can't happen because of the transitive property), or maybe something else.\n\nWait, perhaps S can take on values 3, 1, -1, -3, but how often?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3. Let's see:\n\nCase 1: All spins same. So S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or all -1. Then each product is +1, so S = 3.\n\nCase 2: Two spins same, one different. For example, S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1. Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So S = 1 -1 -1 = -1. Another arrangement: S1 = S3 = +1, S2=-1. Then S1S3=1, S1S2=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1. Similarly for S2 = S3 and S1 different. So for each of these cases, the sum S is -1.\n\nBut wait, what about all three spins being different? Wait, no, because each spin can only be +1 or -1. For three spins, you can't have all three different; you can have two +1 and one -1, or two -1 and one +1. So the other possibilities are when two are same, one different.\n\nSo for each triplet where exactly two are same and one is different, the sum S is -1. How many such states are there? Let's see: For each spin, how many ways can exactly two be same and one different.\n\nWait, for three spins, the number of states where exactly two are the same and one is different is 3 * 2 = 6. Because for each spin (three choices), it can be the one that's different. And for each, the two same spins can be either +1 or -1. Wait, no, because if you fix the different spin, the others must be same as each other but opposite to the different one. So for each position (1, 2, or 3), you can have that spin be +1 while the others are -1, or that spin be -1 while the others are +1. So each of the three positions gives two possibilities, leading to 3 * 2 =6 states.\n\nWait, but wait, for each case where two are same and one different, the sum S is -1, as I saw earlier. So for each of these 6 states, the energy is E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, no, wait. E is -J multiplied by the sum S. So if S is -1, E is -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, but in case 1, when all spins are same, S is 3. So E would be -J *3.\n\nWait, let me recompute:\n\nE = -J * S.\n\nSo for all same spins, S=3, so E = -3J.\n\nFor the cases where two are same and one different, S = (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, but wait, in that example, S1 and S2 are same, S3 is different. So S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So sum S = 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nSo for each of the 6 states with two same spins, the energy is J.\n\nWhat about the other case, where all three are same but opposite? Wait, no, all three same gives S=3, so E=-3J.\n\nWait, but what about another scenario: what if all three are in a different arrangement, like all opposite? No, because each spin is either +1 or -1. So all three can't be opposite to each other. So the only other case is when all three are same.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The spins can't all be opposite because each pair would have different signs. Wait, if S1 = +1, S2=-1, S3=+1, then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = +1, S2S3 = -1. Sum S = (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1. So that's another state with two same and one different? Wait no, in this case, two are same? No, S1 and S3 are same, S2 is different. So yes, that's part of the 6 states.\n\nWait, but what about when all three are different? Wait, no, with three spins each being +1 or -1, it's impossible for all three to be different. Because you can have two +1 and one -1, or two -1 and one +1. So the two possibilities for all same are S=3 (E=-3J) and the others have S=-1 (E=J).\n\nWait, but wait another case: what if all three are in a way that each pair is anti-aligned? Like S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum S is (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1. So same as before, E=J.\n\nWait, but that's part of the 6 states where two are same and one is different.\n\nWait, but what about another scenario where the sum S is +1. How?\n\nWait, let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. Then S=3, E=-3J.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum S=1-1-1= -1. E=J.\n\nWhat if S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum S=-1+1-1= -1. E=J.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum S=-1-1+1= -1. E=J.\n\nWait, but what about if two pairs are aligned and one is not? Oh, but in three spins, if two pairs are aligned, the third must be aligned as well. Because, for example, if S1=S2 and S1=S3, then S2=S3. So the only possibilities are all three aligned or exactly two aligned and one different.\n\nWait, but wait, what if S1 and S2 are aligned, S1 and S3 are aligned, which would imply S2 and S3 are aligned as well. So that's the all-aligned case.\n\nAlternatively, if S1 and S2 are aligned, S1 and S3 are anti-aligned, then S2 and S3 must be anti-aligned as well. Because S2 = S1, S3 = -S1, so S2 and S3 are -1 each, so S2S3=1? No, wait, if S1 is +1, S2 is +1, S3 is -1. Then S2S3 is (-1). So in this case, S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1.\n\nSo the sum S can be 3 or -1.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Are there any states where the sum S is +1? Let me think.\n\nWait, what about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. E=J.\n\nWait, another case: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. Sum is 3, E=-3J.\n\nWhat about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1. E=J.\n\nWait, I'm not seeing any state where sum S is 1. So perhaps the sum can't be 1. So possible sums are 3 and -1.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of states with sum S=3 and S=-1.\n\nNumber of states with S=3: 2. Because all spins up (+1, +1, +1) and all spins down (-1, -1, -1).\n\nNumber of states with S=-1: 6, as each of the three positions can be the different one, and each can be either +1 or -1.\n\nWait, wait no. Wait, each state where exactly two are same and one is different. For each of the three positions, the different spin can be +1 or -1, but in such a way that the two others are same.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: for each state where exactly two spins are the same and one is different, how many possibilities are there.\n\nFor each spin, say spin 1 is different, spin 2 and 3 same.\n\nSpin 1 can be +1, spins 2 and 3 are -1. Or spin 1 is -1, spins 2 and 3 are +1. So that's 2 possibilities for spin 1 being different.\n\nSimilarly for spin 2 being different: 2 possibilities.\n\nAnd spin 3 being different: 2 possibilities.\n\nSo total 3 * 2 =6 states where exactly two are same, one different. So each of these 6 states has sum S = -1, and energy E= J.\n\nAnd the two states where all are same have sum S=3, E= -3J.\n\nWait, so that's 2 states with E=-3J and 6 states with E= J.\n\nWait, but wait, earlier I thought that in the two same and one different case, the sum S is -1. So E= J.\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp( -\u03b2 E ).\n\nSo each state contributes exp(-\u03b2 E) to Z.\n\nSo for the two states where E = -3J: each contributes exp( -\u03b2 (-3J) ) = exp(3J\u03b2).\n\nWait, because E is -3J, so -\u03b2 E is 3J\u03b2.\n\nSo each of the two states contributes e^{3J\u03b2}, so together 2 e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nFor the six states where E = J: each contributes exp( -\u03b2 (J) ) = e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nSo six times e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nSo the total Z is 2 e^{3J\u03b2} + 6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 2 e^{-3J\u03b2} +6 e^{J\u03b2}, which is the opposite.\n\nOption B is 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}, which matches what I just got.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I mix up the energies?\n\nE is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = -J S, where S is the sum.\n\nSo when S=3, E = -3J.\n\nWhen S=-1, E= J.\n\nSo each state with S=3 contributes e^{-\u03b2 E} = e^{-\u03b2 (-3J)} = e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nEach state with S=-1 contributes e^{-\u03b2 (J)} = e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nSo Z = 2 * e^{3J\u03b2} + 6 * e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}, which is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option B.\n",

So S can be 3, 1, -1, or -3, depending on how many pairs are aligned.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think about possible values for S. The sum S can be:\n\nIf all three are aligned, meaning all S_i are the same. Then each pair product is 1, so S = 3.\n\nIf two pairs are aligned and one isn't. Wait, but can that happen? Let's see: suppose S1 and S2 are aligned, S1 and S3 are aligned. Then S2 and S3 must also be aligned, right? Because if S1 and S2 are same, and S1 and S3 are same, then S2 and S3 must be same.

Let's see:\n\nCase 1: All spins same. So S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or all -1. Then each product is +1, so S = 3.\n\nCase 2: Two spins same, one different. For example, S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1. Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So S = 1 -1 -1 = -1. Another arrangement: S1 = S3 = +1, S2=-1. Then S1S3=1, S1S2=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1. Similarly for S2 = S3 and S1 different. So for each of these cases, the sum S is -1.\n\nBut wait, what about all three spins being different? Wait, no, because each spin can only be +1 or -1. For three spins, you can't have all three different; you can have two +1 and one -1, or two -1 and one +1.

Because for each spin (three choices), it can be the one that's different. And for each, the two same spins can be either +1 or -1. Wait, no, because if you fix the different spin, the others must be same as each other but opposite to the different one. So for each position (1, 2, or 3), you can have that spin be +1 while the others are -1, or that spin be -1 while the others are +1. So each of the three positions gives two possibilities, leading to 3 * 2 =6 states.\n\nWait, but wait, for each case where two are same and one different, the sum S is -1, as I saw earlier. So for each of these 6 states, the energy is E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, no, wait. E is -J multiplied by the sum S. So if S is -1, E is -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, but in case 1, when all spins are same, S is 3. So E would be -J *3.\n\nWait, let me recompute:\n\nE = -J * S.\n\nSo for all same spins, S=3, so E = -3J.\n\nFor the cases where two are same and one different, S = (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, but wait, in that example, S1 and S2 are same, S3 is different. So S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So sum S = 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nSo for each of the 6 states with two same spins, the energy is J.\n\nWhat about the other case, where all three are same but opposite?

So all three can't be opposite to each other. So the only other case is when all three are same.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The spins can't all be opposite because each pair would have different signs. Wait, if S1 = +1, S2=-1, S3=+1, then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = +1, S2S3 = -1. Sum S = (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1.

So yes, that's part of the 6 states.\n\nWait, but what about when all three are different? Wait, no, with three spins each being +1 or -1, it's impossible for all three to be different. Because you can have two +1 and one -1, or two -1 and one +1. So the two possibilities for all same are S=3 (E=-3J) and the others have S=-1 (E=J).\n\nWait, but wait another case: what if all three are in a way that each pair is anti-aligned?

How?\n\nWait, let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. Then S=3, E=-3J.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum S=1-1-1= -1. E=J.\n\nWhat if S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum S=-1+1-1= -1. E=J.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum S=-1-1+1= -1. E=J.\n\nWait, but what about if two pairs are aligned and one is not? Oh, but in three spins, if two pairs are aligned, the third must be aligned as well. Because, for example, if S1=S2 and S1=S3, then S2=S3. So the only possibilities are all three aligned or exactly two aligned and one different.\n\nWait, but wait, what if S1 and S2 are aligned, S1 and S3 are aligned, which would imply S2 and S3 are aligned as well. So that's the all-aligned case.\n\nAlternatively, if S1 and S2 are aligned, S1 and S3 are anti-aligned, then S2 and S3 must be anti-aligned as well. Because S2 = S1, S3 = -S1, so S2 and S3 are -1 each, so S2S3=1? No, wait, if S1 is +1, S2 is +1, S3 is -1. Then S2S3 is (-1). So in this case, S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1.\n\nSo the sum S can be 3 or -1.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Are there any states where the sum S is +1? Let me think.\n\nWait, what about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. E=J.\n\nWait, another case: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. Sum is 3, E=-3J.\n\nWhat about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1. E=J.\n\nWait, I'm not seeing any state where sum S is 1. So perhaps the sum can't be 1. So possible sums are 3 and -1.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of states with sum S=3 and S=-1.\n\nNumber of states with S=3: 2. Because all spins up (+1, +1, +1) and all spins down (-1, -1, -1).\n\nNumber of states with S=-1: 6, as each of the three positions can be the different one, and each can be either +1 or -1.\n\nWait, wait no. Wait, each state where exactly two are same and one is different. For each of the three positions, the different spin can be +1 or -1, but in such a way that the two others are same.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: for each state where exactly two spins are the same and one is different, how many possibilities are there.\n\nFor each spin, say spin 1 is different, spin 2 and 3 same.\n\nSpin 1 can be +1, spins 2 and 3 are -1. Or spin 1 is -1, spins 2 and 3 are +1. So that's 2 possibilities for spin 1 being different.\n\nSimilarly for spin 2 being different: 2 possibilities.\n\nAnd spin 3 being different: 2 possibilities.\n\nSo total 3 * 2 =6 states where exactly two are same, one different. So each of these 6 states has sum S = -1, and energy E= J.\n\nAnd the two states where all are same have sum S=3, E= -3J.\n\nWait, so that's 2 states with E=-3J and 6 states with E= J.\n\nWait, but wait, earlier I thought that in the two same and one different case, the sum S is -1. So E= J.\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp( -\u03b2 E ).\n\nSo each state contributes exp(-\u03b2 E) to Z.\n\nSo for the two states where E = -3J: each contributes exp( -\u03b2 (-3J) ) = exp(3J\u03b2).\n\nWait, because E is -3J, so -\u03b2 E is 3J\u03b2.\n\nSo each of the two states contributes e^{3J\u03b2}, so together 2 e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nFor the six states where E = J: each contributes exp( -\u03b2 (J) ) = e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nSo six times e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nSo the total Z is 2 e^{3J\u03b2} + 6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 2 e^{-3J\u03b2} +6 e^{J\u03b2}, which is the opposite.\n\nOption B is 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}, which matches what I just got.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I mix up the energies?\n\nE is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = -J S, where S is the sum.\n\nSo when S=3, E = -3J.\n\nWhen S=-1, E= J.\n\nSo each state with S=3 contributes e^{-\u03b2 E} = e^{-\u03b2 (-3J)} = e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nEach state with S=-1 contributes e^{-\u03b2 (J)} = e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nSo Z = 2 * e^{3J\u03b2} + 6 * e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}, which is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the partition function \\( Z \\) for the given system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\), and the energy is \\( E = -J [S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Possible States**: There are \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) possible states for the three spins.\n2. **Energy Depends on Pairwise Products**: The energy depends on the sum \\( S = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \\), where each term \\( S_iS_j \\) is \\( +1 \\) if the spins are aligned and \\( -1 \\) if they are anti-aligned.\n\n### Analysis of Possible States:\n- **Case 1: All Spins Aligned**  \n  If all spins are the same (\\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \\) or \\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1 \\)), then \\( S = 3 \\).  \n  The energy is \\( E = -J \\cdot S = -3J \\).  \n  There are 2 such states, and each contributes \\( e^{-\\beta E} = e^{3J\\beta} \\) to \\( Z \\).  \n  Contribution: \\( 2e^{3J\\beta} \\).\n\n- **Case 2: Two Spins Aligned, One Different**  \n  If exactly two spins are aligned and one is different, the sum \\( S \\) becomes \\( -1 \\).  \n  The energy is \\( E = -J \\cdot S = J \\).  \n  There are 6 such states (3 choices for the different spin, and 2 possibilities for its value).  \n  Each contributes \\( e^{-\\beta E} = e^{-J\\beta} \\) to \\( Z \\).  \n  Contribution: \\( 6e^{-J\\beta} \\).\n\n### Partition Function:\nThe partition function \\( Z \\) is the sum of contributions from all states:\n\\[\nZ = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta}.\n\\]\n\n### Matching with Options:\n- **Option A**: \\( Z = 2e^{-3J\\beta} + 6e^{J\\beta} \\) (incorrect, signs of exponents are reversed).  \n- **Option B**: \\( Z = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta} \\) (correct, matches the derived expression).  \n- **Option C**: \\( Z = 2e^{2J\\beta} + 6e^{-2J\\beta} \\) (incorrect, incorrect exponents).  \n- **Option D**: \\( Z = 6e^{2J\\beta} + 2e^{-2J\\beta} \\) (incorrect, incorrect coefficients and exponents).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct partition function is \\( Z = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta} \\), which corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

I need to find all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate the energy for each, then compute the partition function Z as the sum of e^(-\u03b2 E) for each state.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the structure of the energy. The energy is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. So, each term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 can be either +1 or -1. The sum of these three terms will determine the energy.\n\nWait, let's compute each possible sum. Each S_i is \u00b11, so S_i S_j is also \u00b11. Let me denote each pair product as a variable. Let me call a = S1S2, b = S1S3, c = S2S3. Then the energy is E = -J(a + b + c).\n\nWait, but a, b, c are each either +1 or -1. So the sum a + b + c can range from -3 to +3. But are all these sums possible? Let me think. \n\nFor example, when all three pairs are +1, sum is 3. But if two are +1 and one is -1, sum is 1. If one is +1 and two are -1, sum is -1. And if all three are -1, sum is -3. So possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me think: what are the possible values of a + b + c? Let's take a specific case. Let me take S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1. Then a=1, b=1, c=1 \u2192 sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then a=1, b=-1, c=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then a=-1, b=+1, c=-1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1 \u2192 E=J.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of +1 and -1 in the pair products. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the number of states that lead to each possible energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the number of states for each possible value of (a + b + c). Let me think about how many states have a + b + c equal to 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, but each spin configuration leads to a specific a, b, c. Let me find how many states have a + b + c = 3. That would mean a=1, b=1, c=1. Which implies S1S2=1 \u2192 S1=S2, S1S3=1 \u2192 S1=S3, S2S3=1 \u2192 S2=S3. So all three spins are the same. So S1=S2=S3=+1 or all -1. So that's two states: all up or all down. So for sum 3, there are 2 states.\n\nWhat about sum -3? That would require a=-1, b=-1, c=-1. So S1S2 = -1 \u2192 S1\u2260S2, same for S1S3 and S2S3. Let me see. If S1 is +1, then S2 must be -1, S3 must be -1. But then S2S3 = (+1)(-1)= -1 \u2192 which is correct. So this is a state where all three spins are opposite? Wait, no. Let me think: if S1=+1, then S2=-1, S3=-1. So S2S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1. Oh wait, that's not equal to -1. So a + b + c = -3 would require a= -1, b=-1, c=-1. So in this case, each pair product is -1. So S1S2 = -1 \u2192 S1\u2260S2. Similarly, S1S3 = -1 \u2192 S1\u2260S3. And S2S3 = -1 \u2192 S2\u2260S3.\n\nWait, but if S1\u2260S2, S1\u2260S3, and S2\u2260S3, then all three spins are different? But wait, each spin can only be \u00b11. So S1, S2, S3 must all be different? But that's impossible with three spins. Because if S1 and S2 are different, and S1 and S3 are different, then S2 and S3 must be the same. Because if S1 is +1, S2 is -1, S3 is +1. So S2S3 is (-1)(+1) = -1. Oh wait, so that would satisfy a= -1, b= -1, c= -1. So how many such states are there?\n\nLet me count. Let's say S1 = +1. Then S2 must be -1, S3 must be -1. Because S1\u2260S2 (a=-1), S1\u2260S3 (b=-1). Then S2 and S3 must be the same, because S2S3 = (-1)(-1) = 1. But that's +1, which is not -1. So c would be +1, which doesn't match the requirement of c=-1. So this scenario can't happen. So wait, maybe there's no state where a + b + c = -3.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. For a + b + c = -3, each of a, b, c must be -1. So:\n\na = S1 S2 = -1 \u2192 S1 \u2260 S2\nb = S1 S3 = -1 \u2192 S1 \u2260 S3\nc = S2 S3 = -1 \u2192 S2 \u2260 S3\n\nSo S1 \u2260 S2, S1 \u2260 S3, S2 \u2260 S3.\n\nLet's pick S1 = +1. Then S2 must be -1, S3 must be -1. Then S2 S3 = (-1)(-1)=+1 \u2192 c=+1, which doesn't equal -1. So this doesn't work.\n\nWhat if S1 is +1, S2 is -1, and S3 is +1? Then S1 S3 = +1 \u2192 b=+1, which doesn't satisfy b=-1. So that's not acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, is there any possible combination where all three pair products are -1? It seems impossible because the spins are only \u00b11. Because if S1 is +1, then S2 and S3 must be -1, but then S2 and S3 are the same, so their product is +1, which doesn't give c=-1. So perhaps there's no state where a + b + c = -3. So the possible sums are 3, 1, -1, and maybe -3 isn't possible. Or wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can't be -3 because it's impossible. So possible sums are 3, 1, -1. Wait, let me think. Let me calculate all possible sums.\n\nWait, let's see. For each of the 8 states, what's the sum a + b + c?\n\nLet me list all possible states. Each spin is S1, S2, S3 = \u00b11.\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\na=1, b=1, c=1 \u2192 sum=3\nE = -J*(3) = -3J\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\na=1, b=-1, c=-1 \u2192 sum=1-1-1 = -1\nE = -J*(-1) = J\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\na=-1, b=1, c=-1 \u2192 sum=-1+1-1 = -1\nE=J\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\na=-1, b=-1, c=1 \u2192 sum=-1-1+1= -1\nE=J\n\nWait, that's three states with sum -1. Hmm, that's different from earlier thought.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute each:\n\nState 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\na = S1 S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1\n\nb = S1 S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1\n\nc = S2 S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1\n\nSo sum a + b + c = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.\n\nSo E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nHmm, so for state 4, sum is -1. So that's a sum of -1.\n\nWait, then perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me proceed with all 8 states.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n\na = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nb = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nc = (+1)(+1)=1\n\nsum: -1 -1 +1 = -1 \u2192 E= J.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n\na = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nb = (-1)(-1) = 1\n\nc = (+1)(-1) = -1\n\nsum: -1 +1 -1 = -1 \u2192 E= J.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n\na = (-1)(-1) = 1\n\nb = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nc = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nsum: 1 -1 -1 = -1 \u2192 E= J.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\na=1, b=1, c=1 \u2192 sum=3 \u2192 E= -3J.\n\nWait, so now, looking at all 8 states:\n\nStates 1 and 8 have sum 3 and -3? Wait no: E = -J*(sum), so for sum=3, E = -3J; for sum=-3, E = 3J.\n\nWait wait, no. For sum =3, E is -3J.\n\nBut in state 8, all spins are -1, so S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So sum is 3, E=-3J.\n\nWait, that's the same as state 1. So states 1 and 8 have sum=3, E=-3J. So two states.\n\nStates 2,3,4,5,6,7 have sum=-1, E= J.\n\nWait, how many states have sum=-1? There are 6 states, right? Because in the 8 states, two have sum=3, the other six have sum=-1.\n\nWait, but wait: what about sum=3 and sum=-3? Earlier, I thought sum=-3 wasn't possible, but in state 8, sum is 3. Wait, no. State 8: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1. So a= S1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1, same for b and c. So sum is 3. So E is -3J.\n\nSo for sum=3, there are two states (all up, all down).\n\nFor sum=-3, are there any states? Let me think: perhaps there are no states with sum=-3. Because in all the 8 states I evaluated, no state has a sum of -3. So perhaps the possible sums are 3 and -1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the 8 states, sum can be 3, or -1. So sum=3 occurs in two states, sum=-1 occurs in six states.\n\nWait, but wait: looking back, in state 2, sum is 1-1-1 = -1.\n\nHmm, so for each of the 8 states, the sum is either 3 (two states) or -1 (six states).\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I think of the sum of the three pair products, they can't all be -1. Because if you have three pair products each being -1, that would require the spins to be arranged in a certain way, but from the 8 states, I only see sum=3 and sum=-1.\n\nSo the possible energies are:\n\n-3J (sum=3) and J (sum=-1).\n\nSo now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^(-\u03b2 E).\n\nEach state contributes e^(-\u03b2 E), so for the two states with E=-3J, each contributes e^(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = e^(3J\u03b2).\n\nFor the six states with E=J, each contributes e^(-\u03b2*J) = e^(-J\u03b2).\n\nSo Z = 2 * e^(3J\u03b2) + 6 * e^(-J\u03b2).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B is Z=2 e^(3J\u03b2) +6e^(-J\u03b2). So that's option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6 e^(J\u03b2), which would be if the energies were +3J and -J, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, wait, the energy is E= -J (sum of pairs), so when sum is 3, E= -3J. So for that state, the Boltzmann factor is e^(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = e^(3J\u03b2).\n\nSo yes, the two states contribute 2 e^(3J\u03b2), and the six states contribute 6 e^(-J\u03b2).\n\nSo the correct Z is 2e^(3J\u03b2) +6e^(-J\u03b2), which is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I remember that the partition function is a sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor for each state. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3], and each spin can be either +1 or -1. \n\nWait, each spin can take two values, so there are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible states for the system. I need to find all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate the energy for each, then compute the partition function Z as the sum of e^(-\u03b2 E) for each state.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the structure of the energy. The energy is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. So, each term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 can be either +1 or -1. The sum of these three terms will determine the energy.\n\nWait, let's compute each possible sum. Each S_i is \u00b11, so S_i S_j is also \u00b11. Let me denote each pair product as a variable. Let me call a = S1S2, b = S1S3, c = S2S3. Then the energy is E = -J(a + b + c).\n\nWait, but a, b, c are each either +1 or -1. So the sum a + b + c can range from -3 to +3. But are all these sums possible? Let me think. \n\nFor example, when all three pairs are +1, sum is 3. But if two are +1 and one is -1, sum is 1. If one is +1 and two are -1, sum is -1. And if all three are -1, sum is -3. So possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me think: what are the possible values of a + b + c? Let's take a specific case. Let me take S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1. Then a=1, b=1, c=1 \u2192 sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then a=1, b=-1, c=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then a=-1, b=+1, c=-1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1 \u2192 E=J.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of +1 and -1 in the pair products. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the number of states that lead to each possible energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the number of states for each possible value of (a + b + c). Let me think about how many states have a + b + c equal to 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, but each spin configuration leads to a specific a, b, c. Let me find how many states have a + b + c = 3. That would mean a=1, b=1, c=1. Which implies S1S2=1 \u2192 S1=S2, S1S3=1 \u2192 S1=S3, S2S3=1 \u2192 S2=S3. So all three spins are the same. So S1=S2=S3=+1 or all -1. So that's two states: all up or all down. So for sum 3, there are 2 states.\n\nWhat about sum -3? That would require a=-1, b=-1, c=-1. So S1S2 = -1 \u2192 S1\u2260S2, same for S1S3 and S2S3. Let me see. If S1 is +1, then S2 must be -1, S3 must be -1. But then S2S3 = (+1)(-1)= -1 \u2192 which is correct. So this is a state where all three spins are opposite? Wait, no. Let me think: if S1=+1, then S2=-1, S3=-1. So S2S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1. Oh wait, that's not equal to -1. So a + b + c = -3 would require a= -1, b=-1, c=-1. So in this case, each pair product is -1. So S1S2 = -1 \u2192 S1\u2260S2. Similarly, S1S3 = -1 \u2192 S1\u2260S3. And S2S3 = -1 \u2192 S2\u2260S3.\n\nWait, but if S1\u2260S2, S1\u2260S3, and S2\u2260S3, then all three spins are different? But wait, each spin can only be \u00b11. So S1, S2, S3 must all be different? But that's impossible with three spins. Because if S1 and S2 are different, and S1 and S3 are different, then S2 and S3 must be the same. Because if S1 is +1, S2 is -1, S3 is +1. So S2S3 is (-1)(+1) = -1.

So c would be +1, which doesn't match the requirement of c=-1. So this scenario can't happen. So wait, maybe there's no state where a + b + c = -3.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. For a + b + c = -3, each of a, b, c must be -1. So:\n\na = S1 S2 = -1 \u2192 S1 \u2260 S2\nb = S1 S3 = -1 \u2192 S1 \u2260 S3\nc = S2 S3 = -1 \u2192 S2 \u2260 S3\n\nSo S1 \u2260 S2, S1 \u2260 S3, S2 \u2260 S3.\n\nLet's pick S1 = +1. Then S2 must be -1, S3 must be -1. Then S2 S3 = (-1)(-1)=+1 \u2192 c=+1, which doesn't equal -1. So this doesn't work.\n\nWhat if S1 is +1, S2 is -1, and S3 is +1? Then S1 S3 = +1 \u2192 b=+1, which doesn't satisfy b=-1. So that's not acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, is there any possible combination where all three pair products are -1? It seems impossible because the spins are only \u00b11. Because if S1 is +1, then S2 and S3 must be -1, but then S2 and S3 are the same, so their product is +1, which doesn't give c=-1. So perhaps there's no state where a + b + c = -3. So the possible sums are 3, 1, -1, and maybe -3 isn't possible. Or wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can't be -3 because it's impossible. So possible sums are 3, 1, -1. Wait, let me think. Let me calculate all possible sums.\n\nWait, let's see. For each of the 8 states, what's the sum a + b + c?\n\nLet me list all possible states. Each spin is S1, S2, S3 = \u00b11.\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\na=1, b=1, c=1 \u2192 sum=3\nE = -J*(3) = -3J\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\na=1, b=-1, c=-1 \u2192 sum=1-1-1 = -1\nE = -J*(-1) = J\n\n3.

Hmm, that's different from earlier thought.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute each:\n\nState 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\na = S1 S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1\n\nb = S1 S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1\n\nc = S2 S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1\n\nSo sum a + b + c = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.\n\nSo E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nHmm, so for state 4, sum is -1. So that's a sum of -1.\n\nWait, then perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me proceed with all 8 states.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n\na = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nb = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nc = (+1)(+1)=1\n\nsum: -1 -1 +1 = -1 \u2192 E= J.\n\n6.

S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\na=1, b=1, c=1 \u2192 sum=3 \u2192 E= -3J.\n\nWait, so now, looking at all 8 states:\n\nStates 1 and 8 have sum 3 and -3? Wait no: E = -J*(sum), so for sum=3, E = -3J; for sum=-3, E = 3J.\n\nWait wait, no. For sum =3, E is -3J.\n\nBut in state 8, all spins are -1, so S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So sum is 3, E=-3J.\n\nWait, that's the same as state 1. So states 1 and 8 have sum=3, E=-3J. So two states.\n\nStates 2,3,4,5,6,7 have sum=-1, E= J.\n\nWait, how many states have sum=-1? There are 6 states, right? Because in the 8 states, two have sum=3, the other six have sum=-1.\n\nWait, but wait: what about sum=3 and sum=-3? Earlier, I thought sum=-3 wasn't possible, but in state 8, sum is 3. Wait, no. State 8: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1. So a= S1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1, same for b and c. So sum is 3. So E is -3J.\n\nSo for sum=3, there are two states (all up, all down).\n\nFor sum=-3, are there any states? Let me think: perhaps there are no states with sum=-3. Because in all the 8 states I evaluated, no state has a sum of -3. So perhaps the possible sums are 3 and -1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the 8 states, sum can be 3, or -1. So sum=3 occurs in two states, sum=-1 occurs in six states.\n\nWait, but wait: looking back, in state 2, sum is 1-1-1 = -1.\n\nHmm, so for each of the 8 states, the sum is either 3 (two states) or -1 (six states).\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I think of the sum of the three pair products, they can't all be -1. Because if you have three pair products each being -1, that would require the spins to be arranged in a certain way, but from the 8 states, I only see sum=3 and sum=-1.\n\nSo the possible energies are:\n\n-3J (sum=3) and J (sum=-1).\n\nSo now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^(-\u03b2 E).\n\nEach state contributes e^(-\u03b2 E), so for the two states with E=-3J, each contributes e^(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = e^(3J\u03b2).\n\nFor the six states with E=J, each contributes e^(-\u03b2*J) = e^(-J\u03b2).\n\nSo Z = 2 * e^(3J\u03b2) + 6 * e^(-J\u03b2).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B is Z=2 e^(3J\u03b2) +6e^(-J\u03b2). So that's option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6 e^(J\u03b2), which would be if the energies were +3J and -J, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, wait, the energy is E= -J (sum of pairs), so when sum is 3, E= -3J. So for that state, the Boltzmann factor is e^(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = e^(3J\u03b2).\n\nSo yes, the two states contribute 2 e^(3J\u03b2), and the six states contribute 6 e^(-J\u03b2).\n\nSo the correct Z is 2e^(3J\u03b2) +6e^(-J\u03b2), which is option B.\n\n\nTo find the partition function \\( Z \\) for the system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), we start with the given energy \\( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\). The partition function is defined as:\n\n\\[\nZ = \\sum_{\\text{all states}} e^{-\\beta E},\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\beta = 1/kT \\).\n\n### Step 1: Possible States and Energy Levels\nEach spin can take two values, so there are \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) possible states. The energy depends on the sum \\( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \\), which can take the values \\( 3, 1, -1, -3 \\). However, upon analyzing all 8 states, we find that the possible sums are \\( 3 \\) and \\( -1 \\). The corresponding energies are:\n\n- For sum \\( 3 \\): \\( E = -3J \\),\n- For sum \\( -1 \\): \\( E = J \\).\n\n### Step 2: Counting States for Each Energy Level\n- **Sum \\( 3 \\):** This occurs in two states where all spins are aligned, either all \\( +1 \\) or all \\( -1 \\).\n- **Sum \\( -1 \\):** This occurs in six states where the spins are not all aligned.\n\nThus, there are:\n- \\( 2 \\) states with \\( E = -3J \\),\n- \\( 6 \\) states with \\( E = J \\).\n\n### Step 3: Partition Function\nThe partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each state:\n\n\\[\nZ = \\sum_{\\text{states}} e^{-\\beta E}.\n\\]\n\nFor the two states with \\( E = -3J \\), the contribution is:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot e^{-\\beta(-3J)} = 2 \\cdot e^{3J\\beta}.\n\\]\n\nFor the six states with \\( E = J \\), the contribution is:\n\\[\n6 \\cdot e^{-\\beta J} = 6 \\cdot e^{-J\\beta}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the total partition function is:\n\\[\nZ = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Matching with Options\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option B**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{Z = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta}}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. I need to find the partition function Z, and the options are given as A to D.\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling what the partition function is. The partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the system of the Boltzmann factor, which is exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). So each state's energy contributes a term to Z.\n\nSince each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states for the three spins. So I'll need to list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and compute the energy for each, then sum up the corresponding exponential terms.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let's think about the symmetry. The energy depends on the products S_i S_j. Let me see, for each pair (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), their product is either +1 or -1. So the total energy is -J multiplied by the sum of these three products.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can categorize the states based on the number of pairs that are aligned (i.e., their product is +1) or anti-aligned (product is -1). Let me think: each pair contributes +1 if the two spins are the same, and -1 if different.\n\nWait, let me think about that. S_i S_j is +1 if S_i and S_j are the same, and -1 otherwise. So each term S_i S_j can be +1 or -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can range from -3 to +3, depending on how many pairs are aligned.\n\nSo the energy E is -J times that sum. Let's denote the sum as M. So E = -J M.\n\nSo the possible values of M can be:\n\n- If all three pairs are aligned (all +1), M = 3. Then E = -3J.\n\n- If two pairs are aligned and one is not, M = +1. Then E = -J.\n\n- If one pair is aligned, and two are not, M = -1. E = +J.\n\n- If all three pairs are anti-aligned, M = -3. E = +3J.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. The sum of three terms, each \u00b11. So the maximum M is 3 (all three +1), minimum is -3 (all three -1). But can all three pairs be anti-aligned? Let me see.\n\nWait, for three spins, can all three pairs be anti-aligned? Let's see: S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Let me solve for S1, S2, S3.\n\nIf S1 S2 = -1, then S2 = -S1.\n\nS1 S3 = -1 \u2192 S3 = -S1.\n\nS2 S3 = (-S1)(-S1) = S1^2 = 1. So S2 S3 = +1, which is not -1. So all three can't be anti-aligned. So M can't be -3. So the possible M values are 3, 1, -1, and maybe 3 is the maximum, but can M be 3?\n\nWait, when all three are aligned, let's see:\n\nIf S1 = S2 = S3 = +1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. So M=3, E=-3J.\n\nIf two spins are +1, and one is -1, let's see:\n\nFor example, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nThen S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So M=+1-1-1 = -1. Wait, no, that would make M = -1. Wait, but that's only one aligned pair. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of aligned pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to find all possible states and compute M for each.\n\nSo the eight possible states are:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 \u2192 all aligned.\n\nCompute M: 1+1+1=3 \u2192 E=-3J.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nCompute M: S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So M=-1 \u2192 E=+J.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nM: S1S2 = -1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1 \u2192 M=-1 \u2192 E=J.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nM: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum is -1-1+1 = -1 \u2192 M=-1 \u2192 E=J.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nM: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1 \u2192 sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1 \u2192 M=-1 \u2192 E=J.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nM: S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1 \u2192 M=-1 \u2192 E=J.\n\n7.

S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nM: S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1 \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 E=-3J.\n\nWait, so looking at all the states:\n\n- Only state 1 and 8 have M=3 and M=-3? Wait, no. Wait, state 8 has all S=-1, so S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1 \u2192 M=3. So E= -3J.\n\nSo states 1 and 8 have M=3, and E=-3J.\n\nStates 2,3,4,5,6,7: each have M=-1. So E= +J.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me check each state again.\n\nWait, state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3= -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So M=-1, E=J.\n\nSame for state 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1 \u2192 M=-1, E=J.\n\nState 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1 \u2192 M=-1, E=J.\n\nState 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1 \u2192 M=-1, E=J.\n\nState 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1 \u2192 M=-1, E=J.\n\nState 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: +1 -1 -1 = -1 \u2192 M=-1, E=J.\n\nSo only two states have M=3: state 1 and state 8.\n\nWait, no. Wait, state 1 has all spins +1, so M=3.\n\nState 8 has all spins -1, so S1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1, same for S1S3 and S2S3. So M=3, same as state 1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought M can't be -3. Because when I tried all three pairs being -1, it's impossible. So that's why only M=3 and M=-1 are possible. Wait, no. Because in the example earlier, all three pairs can't be -1. So the possible M values are 3 and -1?\n\nWait, but in the states, I see M=-1 occurs for 6 states, and M=3 occurs for 2 states. So the energies are E=-3J for two states, and E=J for six states.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because E is -J*M, right? So M=3 gives E=-3J, M=-1 gives E= J.\n\nWait, but wait, in the calculation for state 2: M=-1 \u2192 E= +J.\n\nWait, but the initial energy is E= -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].\n\nSo for state 2, the sum S1S2 + ... is (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nSo E = -J * (-1) = +J.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-\u03b2 E).\n\nSo for each state, compute exp(-\u03b2 E), and sum all.\n\nIn our case:\n\nTwo states have E=-3J \u2192 exp(\u03b2*3J) each.\n\nSix states have E=+J \u2192 exp(-\u03b2 J) each.\n\nSo Z = 2 * exp(3J \u03b2) + 6 * exp(-J \u03b2).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: Z=2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6 e^{J\u03b2} \u2192 No, because the exponents are opposite.\n\nOption B: Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 That's what I got. So that's option B.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOption B says 2 e^(3J\u03b2) +6 e^(-J\u03b2). Which matches.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

So M=3 gives E=-3J, M=-1 gives E= J.\n\nWait, but wait, in the calculation for state 2: M=-1 \u2192 E= +J.\n\nWait, but the initial energy is E= -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].\n\nSo for state 2, the sum S1S2 + ... is (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nSo E = -J * (-1) = +J.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-\u03b2 E).\n\nSo for each state, compute exp(-\u03b2 E), and sum all.\n\nIn our case:\n\nTwo states have E=-3J \u2192 exp(\u03b2*3J) each.\n\nSix states have E=+J \u2192 exp(-\u03b2 J) each.\n\nSo Z = 2 * exp(3J \u03b2) + 6 * exp(-J \u03b2).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: Z=2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6 e^{J\u03b2} \u2192 No, because the exponents are opposite.\n\nOption B: Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 That's what I got. So that's option B.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOption B says 2 e^(3J\u03b2) +6 e^(-J\u03b2). Which matches.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo find the partition function \\( Z \\) for the system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\), we start by analyzing the energy of the system. The energy is given by:\n\n\\[\nE = -J \\left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \\right).\n\\]\n\nThe partition function \\( Z \\) is defined as the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor \\( e^{-\\beta E} \\), where \\( \\beta = 1 / (kT) \\). Since there are \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) possible states for the three spins, we enumerate all states and calculate their corresponding energies.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. Each spin pair \\( S_i S_j \\) contributes \\( +1 \\) if the spins are aligned and \\( -1 \\) if anti-aligned. The total energy depends on the sum \\( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \\), which can range from \\( -3 \\) to \\( +3 \\).\n2. By examining all 8 states, we find:\n   - **Two states** (all spins aligned or all anti-aligned) have \\( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 = 3 \\), leading to \\( E = -3J \\).\n   - **Six states** (mixtures of aligned and anti-aligned spins) have \\( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 = -1 \\), leading to \\( E = J \\).\n\n### Partition Function:\nThe partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states:\n\n\\[\nZ = \\sum_{\\text{states}} e^{-\\beta E}.\n\\]\n\n- For the two states with \\( E = -3J \\), the contribution is \\( 2 e^{3J\\beta} \\).\n- For the six states with \\( E = J \\), the contribution is \\( 6 e^{-J\\beta} \\).\n\nThus, the partition function is:\n\n\\[\nZ = 2 e^{3J\\beta} + 6 e^{-J\\beta}.\n\\]\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **Option A:** \\( Z = 2 e^{-3J\\beta} + 6 e^{J\\beta} \\) \u2014 Incorrect, as the exponents are reversed.\n- **Option B:** \\( Z = 2 e^{3J\\beta} + 6 e^{-J\\beta} \\) \u2014 Correct, matches the derived expression.\n- **Option C:** \\( Z = 2 e^{2J\\beta} + 6 e^{-2J\\beta} \\) \u2014 Incorrect, as the exponents are doubled.\n- **Option D:** \\( Z = 6 e^{2J\\beta} + 2 e^{-2J\\beta} \\) \u2014 Incorrect, as the coefficients and exponents are wrong.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct partition function is \\( Z = 2 e^{3J\\beta} + 6 e^{-J\\beta} \\), which corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. So the setup is three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). And we need to find the partition function Z. The options are A to D.\n\nWait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), right? Oh wait, no, wait. No, the partition function Z is the sum over all microstates of exp(-\u03b2E), where E is the energy of that microstate. Since \u03b2 is 1/(kT), but I think I can treat it as a variable for now.\n\nSo each spin is either +1 or -1. For three spins, how many possible states are there? Each spin has 2 options, so 2^3 =8 states total.\n\nSo I need to list all possible states and calculate the energy for each, then sum exp(-\u03b2 E) for each state.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's denote this sum as S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nEach term S1S2 can be +1 or -1, same for the others. But the sum S can vary. Let me find all possible values of S.\n\nWait, let me think about the possible combinations. Let's consider each pair:\n\nCase 1: All spins are the same. So S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or all = -1.\n\nIn that case, each product S1S2 = +1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. So S = 3.\n\nCase 2: Two spins are +1, one is -1.\n\nLet's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nThen S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, other permutations would give the same sum. So in this case, S = -1.\n\nWait, how many such states are there? For each spin being the one that's -1, so three possibilities. So three states where two are +1, one is -1, each with S = -1.\n\nCase 3: Two spins are -1, one is +1.\n\nLet's take S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(-1)=+1. S1S3 = (-1)(+1)=-1. S2S3 = (-1)(+1)=-1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, same as the previous case. So the sum is again -1. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, for the case where two are -1 and one +1:\n\nLet's take S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(-1) = +1.\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nSo sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. Yes, same as before.\n\nSo whether two are +1 and one -1, or two -1 and one +1, the sum S is -1.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think of another scenario. What if all three spins are different? No, each spin can only be +1 or -1, so three spins can't all be different because there are only two possible values. So the possible cases are:\n\n1. All same: sum S=3 (two possibilities: all +1 or all -1).\n\n2. Exactly two +1 and one -1: sum S=-1 (three possibilities).\n\n3. Exactly two -1 and one +1: sum S=-1 (three possibilities).\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, no, because in cases 2 and 3, the sum is the same. So all the cases where two are the same and one different have sum S=-1. So how many states have S=3, S=-1, etc.?\n\nWait, let's recount. All three same: 2 states (all +1 or all -1), each with S=3.\n\nThen, for the other 6 states (8 total minus 2), each has S=-1.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 2 + 6 =8, which is correct. So each of the 6 states (3 where two are +1, one -1; and 3 where two are -1, one +1) has S=-1.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. Let's compute the sum S for each state.\n\nTake S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: S=3.\n\nS1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S= (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S= (-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nAnd S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1: S= (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nSimilarly for the other three states where two are -1 and one is +1:\n\nS1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S= (+1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nS1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S= (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nS1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1: S= (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 -1 +1 = 1.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Wait, in that last case, S=1. So I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recalculate this last case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1.\n\nSo sum S = (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1.\n\nWait, that adds up to -1, not 1. So I must have made a mistake earlier. So all the states where exactly two are the same and one different have S=-1. So all 6 states have S=-1.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me take another example: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1), S1S3 = (-1), S2S3 = (+1). Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nSo yes, all those 6 states have S=-1.\n\nOnly the two states where all are same have S=3.\n\nWait, but wait another case: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then sum is 1 (from S1S2) + (-1)(S1S3) + (-1)(S2S3) = 1-1-1 = -1.\n\nSo all 6 states have S=-1. So the possible values of S are 3 and -1.\n\nSo each of the two all-same states have S=3, and the remaining 6 have S=-1.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think of another possibility. What if all three spins are different? Oh, no, because each spin can only be +1 or -1. So the maximum number of different spins is 2, but since there are three spins, you can't have all three different. So the only possibilities are all same, two same and one different.\n\nSo the sum S can be 3 or -1.\n\nSo for each state, the energy E is given by E = -J * S.\n\nSo for S=3, E = -J * 3 = -3J.\n\nFor S=-1, E = -J * (-1) = J.\n\nSo for each state with S=3, the energy is -3J. There are two such states.\n\nFor each state with S=-1, the energy is J. There are six such states.\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp( -\u03b2 E ), since Z = sum exp( -beta E ) for each state.\n\nWait, wait, no, because E is the energy of each state. So for each state, we calculate exp( -\u03b2 E ), and sum all of them.\n\nSo Z = sum exp( -beta E ) for each state.\n\nSo for the two states with E = -3J, each contributes exp( -beta (-3J) ) = exp( 3 J beta ).\n\nFor the six states with E = J, each contributes exp( -beta (J) ) = exp( - J beta ).\n\nSo Z = 2 * exp(3 J beta) + 6 * exp( - J beta ).\n\nLooking at the options, let's see which one matches.\n\nOption B says Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2) +6e^(-J\u03b2). That's exactly what I have.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

I need to find the partition function Z.\n\nHmm, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). So I need to find all possible states of the three spins, calculate E for each, and then sum exp(-\u03b2E) for each state.\n\nWait, each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them out. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3.\n\nLet me think about each state and compute the energy for each.\n\nBut wait, the energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So for each state, I need to compute each pair product and sum them, then multiply by -J.\n\nWait, let's compute the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state.\n\nLet me list all 8 possible states:\n\n1.

Let me double-check. Because in state2, S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1. So E= -J*(-1) = J. Yes.\n\nSo, out of 8 states:\n\n- Two states (state1 and state8) have E = -3J\n- Six states (states 2-7) have E= J.\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-\u03b2 E).\n\nSo for each state, compute exp(-\u03b2 E) and sum them.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFor the two states with E=-3J:\nexp(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = exp(3 J \u03b2)\n\nFor each of the six states with E=J:\nexp(-\u03b2*(J)) = exp(- J \u03b2)\n\nSo Z = 2 * exp(3 J \u03b2) + 6 * exp(- J \u03b2).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6 e^(J\u03b2).

So exp(-\u03b2 E) is exp(3J \u03b2). So yes, correct.\n\nFor the other states, E= J.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let's think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nThe problem says there are three spins, S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. The options are given, so maybe I can figure out the possible states and calculate their energies.\n\nWait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). Each state is a combination of the three spins being +1 or -1. So each spin has two options, so total number of states is 2^3 =8. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nLet me list all possible states. Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3). So all possible combinations are:\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1)\n2. (+1, +1, -1)\n3. (+1, -1, +1)\n4. (+1, -1, -1)\n5. (-1, +1, +1)\n6. (-1, +1, -1)\n7. (-1, -1, +1)\n8. (-1, -1, -1)\n\nNow for each state, I need to compute the energy E, then compute exp(-\u03b2E), and sum all these for Z.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Because each term is the product of two spins, which can be +1 or -1. So each product can be +1 (if the two spins are same) or -1 (if different).\n\nSo let's compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state.\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1)\nEach product is +1. So sum is 3. So E = -J *3.\n\n2. (+1, +1, -1)\nS1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3= -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\n3. (+1, -1, +1)\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3= +1, S2S3= -1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.\n\n4.

For state 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS2S3= (+1)(+1) = +1.\n\nSum is (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recheck each state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe group the states based on how many of the terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are +1 or -1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that each term S_i S_j is +1 if spins i and j are aligned, -1 otherwise. So the sum of the three terms can vary based on the number of aligned pairs.\n\nWait, for each state, how many pairs are aligned?\n\nIn the first state (all +1), all three pairs are aligned. So sum is 3.\n\nIn the second state (+1, +1, -1), the first pair is aligned, the other two are not. So sum is 1.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation for state 2: sum was -1? Wait, let me recalculate. State 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2 = 1*1=1.\n\nS1S3= 1*(-1) =-1.\n\nS2S3= 1*(-1) =-1.\n\nSum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nSo E is -J * (-1) = J.\n\nHmm. So for state 2, E= J.\n\nSimilarly, state 3: (+1, -1, +1). Let's compute each term.\n\nS1S2= +1*-1 = -1.\n\nS1S3= +1*+1= +1.\n\nS2S3= -1*+1= -1.\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.\n\nSame for state 4: (+1, -1, -1).\n\nS1S2= -1.\n\nS1S3= -1* -1 = +1.\n\nWait no, S1 is +1, S3 is -1, so S1S3= -1.\n\nS2S3= (-1)*(-1) = +1.\n\nSo sum: (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1. E= J.\n\nWait, so states 2,3,4 all have E= J.\n\nWait, state 5: (-1, +1, +1).\n\nS1S2= (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS2S3= (+1)(+1) = +1.\n\nSum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E= J.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So E= J.\n\nState 6: (-1, +1, -1).\n\nS1S2= (-1)(+1)= -1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(-1)= +1.\n\nS2S3= (+1)(-1)= -1.\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.

So E= -J*3.\n\nWait, so let me summarize the energies:\n\nState 1: E = -3J.\n\nStates 2,3,4,5,6,7: E= J.\n\nState 8: E = -3J.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So two states (state 1 and 8) have E= -3J, and the other six states have E= J.\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-\u03b2 E).\n\nSo for each state, calculate exp(-\u03b2 E) and sum them.\n\nSo:\n\n- For states 1 and 8: E=-3J. exp(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = exp(3J\u03b2). Each contributes e^{3J\u03b2}. There are two such states, so 2 e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\n- For the other six states: E= J. exp(-\u03b2*(J)) = e^{-J\u03b2}. Each contributes e^{-J\u03b2}. Six of them: 6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nSo Z = 2 e^{3J\u03b2} + 6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 2 e^{-3J\u03b2} +6 e^{J\u03b2} \u2192 No, because for E=-3J, exp(-\u03b2 E) is e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nOption B: 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 Yes, that's what I have.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, I thought when E is negative, like E=-3J, then exp(-beta E) becomes exp(3J beta). Because beta is positive. So yes.\n\nSo in the partition function, for each state, you take exp(-beta E). So for E=-3J, it's e^{3J beta}.\n\nSo the two states with E=-3J contribute 2 e^{3J beta}.\n\nThe six states with E= J contribute 6 e^{-J beta}.\n\nSo Z = 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2}, which matches.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6e^(J\u03b2)\n\nB) 2 e^(3J\u03b2) +6e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nC) 2e^(2J\u03b2) +6e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nD) 6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nSo yeah, option B matches.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier in the energies. Let me recheck one of the states.\n\nWait, state 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS2S3= (+1)(+1) = +1.\n\nSum = -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nE = -J * (-1) = J. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother check: state 3 is (+1, -1, +1). So S1S2 = -1, S1S3= +1, S2S3= -1. Sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1. So E= J.\n\nSo all six states have E= J except the two all-same states.\n\nSo the calculation is correct, Z is 2e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2}, which is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let's think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nThe problem says there are three spins, S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. The options are given, so maybe I can figure out the possible states and calculate their energies.\n\nWait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). Each state is a combination of the three spins being +1 or -1. So each spin has two options, so total number of states is 2^3 =8. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nLet me list all possible states. Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3). So all possible combinations are:\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1)\n2. (+1, +1, -1)\n3. (+1, -1, +1)\n4. (+1, -1, -1)\n5. (-1, +1, +1)\n6. (-1, +1, -1)\n7. (-1, -1, +1)\n8. (-1, -1, -1)\n\nNow for each state, I need to compute the energy E, then compute exp(-\u03b2E), and sum all these for Z.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Because each term is the product of two spins, which can be +1 or -1. So each product can be +1 (if the two spins are same) or -1 (if different).\n\nSo let's compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state.\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1)\nEach product is +1. So sum is 3. So E = -J *3.\n\n2. (+1, +1, -1)\nS1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3= -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\n3. (+1, -1, +1)\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3= +1, S2S3= -1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.\n\n4.

Let me recheck each state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe group the states based on how many of the terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are +1 or -1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that each term S_i S_j is +1 if spins i and j are aligned, -1 otherwise. So the sum of the three terms can vary based on the number of aligned pairs.\n\nWait, for each state, how many pairs are aligned?\n\nIn the first state (all +1), all three pairs are aligned. So sum is 3.\n\nIn the second state (+1, +1, -1), the first pair is aligned, the other two are not. So sum is 1.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation for state 2: sum was -1? Wait, let me recalculate.

Hmm, I need to find the partition function Z. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). So I need to consider all possible configurations of the three spins and calculate their respective energies, then sum the exponentials.\n\nEach spin S1, S2, S3 can be +1 or -1. So the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. I should list all possible states and compute E for each.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 cases. Maybe by considering the interactions and their possible outcomes.\n\nThe energy E is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. Each product S_i S_j can be either +1 (if the spins are the same) or -1 (if opposite). So each term S_i S_j contributes either +1 or -1.\n\nBut in the energy expression, each term is multiplied by -J. So E = -J (sum of the three pairwise products). Let's let the sum be S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J S.\n\nSo the exponent in the partition function will be \u03b2 E = -\u03b2 J S. So each term in Z is exp(-\u03b2 J S) for each state.\n\nSo for each state, I need to find S, then compute exp(-\u03b2 J S), and sum all these.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of S.\n\nEach S is the sum of three terms, each \u00b11. So the maximum possible S is 3 (all three terms +1), and the minimum is -3 (all three terms -1). But I should find the possible values of S and how many states correspond to each S.\n\nWait, let me list all possible states and compute S for each:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:\n   S1S2 = +1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. So S=3.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\n   S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. S = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait no, wait: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So S=-1.\n\n3.

S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:\n   S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. S= 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:\n   S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. S=3.\n\nWait, so looking at all these:\n\nState 1: S=3.\n\nStates 2,3,4,5,6,7: S=-1.\n\nState 8: S=3.\n\nWait, so how many states have S=3? Only states 1 and 8, so two states. Each contributes an S of 3.\n\nAnd the remaining 6 states have S=-1.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recount. Because some of these might have S=3 or S=1 or other values. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait in state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what about other possibilities? Are there any states where S is 1 or -3?\n\nWait, let me think: what is the possible S?\n\nEach term can be +1 or -1, so the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, but in the cases I calculated above, I only got S=3 and S=-1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe there are states where S=1 or S=-3.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nWait for S=1, the sum should be 1.\n\nSo maybe in some states, two terms are +1 and one is -1, leading to S=1.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFor example, state where S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: S=3.\n\nState where S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S=1 -1 -1= -1.\n\nWait, but if two terms are +1 and one is -1, what's the sum?\n\nWait, let's take another state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nSo S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = +1, S2S3 = -1.\n\nSum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nHmm, not 1.\n\nWait, maybe another configuration. Let me think: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: sum 3.\n\nS1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: sum 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nWhat about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: sum is (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some cases where S=1 or S=-3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider all 8 possibilities again.\n\nLet me list all 8 states:\n\n1. All +1: S = 3.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S = (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -3? Wait, no. Wait S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: \n\nS1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1.\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nSo sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nWait, same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps another state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = -1.\n\nS1S3 = -1.\n\nS2S3 = +1.\n\nSum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nHmm, same.\n\nWait, what about S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1: sum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nSame.\n\nWait, S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1: sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nSame.\n\nS1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1: sum is (+1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nSame.\n\nAnd the last state, all -1: sum is 3.\n\nSo I don't see any states where S is 1 or -3. So only two possible S values: 3 and -1.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if all three terms are +1, S=3. If two are +1 and one is -1, then S would be 1 + 1 -1 =1? Or wait, no, because each term is S_i S_j.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in evaluating S. Let me take a different approach.\n\nThe sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nEach term is either +1 or -1. So the possible sums can be:\n\n3 (all +1),\n\n1 (two +1 and one -1),\n\n-1 (two -1 and one +1),\n\n-3 (all -1).\n\nWait, but in my earlier analysis, when I computed all 8 states, I only found S=3 and S=-1. So why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation for some states.\n\nLet me try state 4 again: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1), S1S3 = (-1), S2S3 = (+1).\n\nSo sum is (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.\n\nSo S=-1.\n\nWait, but what if two are +1 and one -1 in the terms. So for example, if two terms are +1 and one is -1, then S=1. But in my earlier analysis, none of the states gave S=1. That suggests that perhaps in this particular setup, S can't be 1 or -3, which doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some states. Let me consider another approach. Perhaps the number of +1 and -1 in the S terms depends on how many pairs are aligned.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of +1 in the three terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3.\n\nEach term is +1 if the spins are aligned, -1 otherwise.\n\nLet me think about the number of aligned pairs in each state.\n\nIn state 1: all aligned. So 3 aligned pairs. So S=3.\n\nIn state 2: two aligned, one not. So two terms +1, one -1. So sum S=1.\n\nWait, wait, I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = +1.\n\nS1S3 = -1.\n\nS2S3 = -1.\n\nSo sum S=1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nHmm, that's -1.\n\nWait, but if two terms are +1 and one is -1, the sum is 1, right? 1 +1 -1 = 1.\n\nWait, but in state 2, sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count how many +1 terms each state has.\n\nWait, another approach: For each state, count the number of +1 in the three terms.\n\nFor example:\n\nState 1: All +1: count is 3 \u2192 S=3.\n\nState 2: S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Count is 1 \u2192 S=1 - 2*(number of -1 terms)? No, wait S is sum of the terms, each term is +1 or -1. So count of +1 terms is n, then S = (n) + (-1)*(3 -n) ) = 2n -3.\n\nSo n can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nSo S can be 2*3-3=3; 2*2-3=1; 2*1-3=-1; 2*0-3=-3.\n\nSo the possible S values are 3,1,-1,-3.\n\nSo I must have missed some states where S=1 or S=-3.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe some states have S=1 or S=-3.\n\nWait, let's take a state where two spins are aligned and one is not. For example:\n\nState where S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: S=3.\n\nState where S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, that's S=-1, but I thought if two are +1 and one is -1, the sum would be 1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the number of aligned pairs. Let me think: for each state, how many pairs are aligned (i.e., S_i S_j = +1).\n\nIn state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nThe pairs are (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).\n\n(1,2) is aligned \u2192 +1.\n\n(1,3) is not aligned \u2192 -1.\n\n(2,3) is not aligned \u2192 -1.\n\nSo two aligned pairs? Wait, no. Only one aligned pair. So number of aligned pairs is 1. So sum S = 1 - 1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier formula S=2n -3, n=1 \u2192 S= -1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: what about a state where two pairs are aligned and one is not?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTake S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. All three pairs are aligned \u2192 n=3 \u2192 S=3.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Only one pair aligned (1,2). So n=1 \u2192 S=-1.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Let's see:\n\nS1S2 = -1 \u2192 not aligned.\n\nS1S3 = +1 \u2192 aligned.\n\nS2S3 = -1 \u2192 not aligned.\n\nSo aligned pairs: only (1,3). n=1 \u2192 S= -1.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2= -1.\n\nS1S3= -1.\n\nS2S3=+1.\n\nSo aligned pairs: only (2,3). So n=1 \u2192 S= -1.\n\nWait, so in all the states I've looked at, n is either 3 or 1, leading to S=3 or S=-1.\n\nSo where are the states with n=2? Like, two aligned pairs.\n\nAh, maybe I'm missing some states where two pairs are aligned and one isn't. Let's think.\n\nWait, for example, can a state have two aligned pairs and one unaligned?\n\nLet's think of a state where S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. All three aligned, n=3.\n\nAnother possibility: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Only one aligned pair.\n\nWait, what about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1?\n\nAs above, that gives n=1.\n\nAnother possibility: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: n=3.\n\nWait, maybe another state: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: n=1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not getting any states with n=2. Let me try to find a state with n=2.\n\nWait, perhaps S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: n=3.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nIn this case:\n\nS1S2=-1.\n\nS1S3=-1.\n\nS2S3=+1.\n\nSo only one aligned pair: (2,3). So n=1 \u2192 S=-1.\n\nHmm, I'm not finding any state where n=2, which would lead to S=1.\n\nWait, maybe such a state doesn't exist. Let me think: is there a state where exactly two pairs are aligned?\n\nWait, perhaps if two spins are +1, and one is -1, but arranged in a way that two pairs are aligned.\n\nWait, let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. All aligned, n=3.\n\nOr, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Only one pair aligned.\n\nWait, perhaps another scenario: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: n=3.\n\nWait, perhaps there's no state with n=2, meaning S cannot be 1 or -3. So maybe the possible S values are 3 and -1.\n\nBut that seems odd. Let me think again. Maybe my earlier analysis was correct, and in this setup, S can only take 3 and -1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake in how S is computed. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAnother approach: the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nEach term is either +1 or -1.\n\nLet me consider all possible combinations of the three terms.\n\nEach term can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3=8 possible combinations for the sum S.\n\nBut in reality, not all combinations are possible because the terms are not independent. For example, S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are products of the same variables, so their values are not independent.\n\nWait, for example, if S1S2=+1 and S1S3=+1, then S2 and S3 must be equal. Because S1S2=+1 implies S2=S1. Similarly, S1S3=+1 implies S3=S1. So S2 and S3 are same, so S2S3=+1.\n\nSo in this case, all three terms are +1. So S=3.\n\nAnother case: S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1.\n\nWait, but if S1S2=+1 and S1S3=+1, then S2=S1 and S3=S1. So S2=S3. Thus, S2S3=+1, not -1. So this combination is impossible.\n\nSo, the sum S can't be any arbitrary combination of the three terms. So possible S values are limited.\n\nSo let's list all possible combinations of the three terms that are possible, given that they are not independent.\n\nPossible cases:\n\n1. All three terms are +1: sum S=3.\n\n2. Two terms are +1, one is -1. But wait, can that happen?\n\nWait, if two terms are +1, the third must also be +1, because if S1S2=+1 and S1S3=+1, then S2 and S3 are same as S1, so S2S3=+1.\n\nThus, the only possible way for two terms to be +1 is when all three are +1.\n\nSimilarly, for two terms to be -1, but that might not be possible.\n\nWait, perhaps another scenario: suppose S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2=+1 \u2192 S2=S1.\n\nS1S3=-1 \u2192 S3 = -S1.\n\nThen S2S3 = S1*(-S1) )= -S1^2 = -1, since S1 is \u00b11.\n\nSo in this case, all three terms would be S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.\n\nSo sum S=1 -1 -1= -1.\n\nAnother scenario: S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2=-1 \u2192 S2 = -S1.\n\nS1S3=+1 \u2192 S3=S1.\n\nS2S3 = (-S1)(S1) )= -S1^2 = -1.\n\nSo the three terms are -1, +1, -1 \u2192 sum S= -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nAnother case: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1.\n\nSo S1S2=-1 \u2192 S2=-S1.\n\nS1S3=-1 \u2192 S3 = -S1.\n\nS2S3 = (-S1)(-S1) )= S1^2 = +1.\n\nSo terms: -1, -1, +1 \u2192 sum S= -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nAnother case: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2=-1 \u2192 S2=-S1.\n\nS1S3=-1 \u2192 S3=-S1.\n\nS2S3 = (-S1)(-S1) )= +1.\n\nSo terms: -1, -1, +1 \u2192 sum S=-1.\n\nWait, but in this case, the sum is -1 again.\n\nSo, from these possibilities, the only possible sum values are S=3 and S=-1.\n\nSo that suggests that the possible S values are 3 and -1, and the number of states for each S.\n\nNow, let's count how many states have S=3 and S=-1.\n\nFrom earlier analysis, states where all three spins are +1 or all are -1 have S=3. So that's two states.\n\nAll other states have S=-1.\n\nSo total number of states: 8.\n\nNumber of states with S=3: 2.\n\nNumber of states with S=-1: 6.\n\nWait, earlier when I considered all 8 states, 6 of them had S=-1 and 2 had S=3.\n\nSo for each state, the energy is E = -J S.\n\nSo for S=3, E = -J *3.\n\nFor S=-1, E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, no: E = -J * S.\n\nSo if S=3, E = -3J.\n\nIf S=-1, E = J.\n\nWait, no: S=-1 \u2192 E= -J * (-1) = J.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nSo for each state, the energy is E = -J S.\n\nNow, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp( -\u03b2 E ), where \u03b2=1/(kT).\n\nSo for each state, the term is exp( \u03b2 J S ), since E=-J S \u2192 -\u03b2 E = \u03b2 J S.\n\nSo for S=3, the term is exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nFor S=-1, the term is exp( (-1)*\u03b2 J ) = exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nNow, each of the two states with S=3 contributes exp(3 \u03b2 J), and each of the six states with S=-1 contributes exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nSo Z = 2 * exp(3 \u03b2 J) + 6 * exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: Z=2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6 e^{J\u03b2}.\n\nNo, because for S=3, it's e^{3\u03b2J}, but option A has e^{-3\u03b2J}.\n\nOption B: Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}. Yes, that matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, when S=3, E = -3J \u2192 -\u03b2 E = 3 \u03b2 J \u2192 exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nWhen S=-1, E= J \u2192 -\u03b2 E = -\u03b2 J \u2192 exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nYes, so Z is 2 exp(3 \u03b2 J) + 6 exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B: 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again:\n\nOption A) Z=2e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2)\n\nOption B) Z=2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nOption C) Z=2e^(2J\u03b2)+6e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nOption D) Z=6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I need to find the partition function Z. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). So I need to consider all possible configurations of the three spins and calculate their respective energies, then sum the exponentials.\n\nEach spin S1, S2, S3 can be +1 or -1. So the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. I should list all possible states and compute E for each.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 cases. Maybe by considering the interactions and their possible outcomes.\n\nThe energy E is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. Each product S_i S_j can be either +1 (if the spins are the same) or -1 (if opposite). So each term S_i S_j contributes either +1 or -1.\n\nBut in the energy expression, each term is multiplied by -J. So E = -J (sum of the three pairwise products). Let's let the sum be S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J S.\n\nSo the exponent in the partition function will be \u03b2 E = -\u03b2 J S. So each term in Z is exp(-\u03b2 J S) for each state.\n\nSo for each state, I need to find S, then compute exp(-\u03b2 J S), and sum all these.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of S.\n\nEach S is the sum of three terms, each \u00b11. So the maximum possible S is 3 (all three terms +1), and the minimum is -3 (all three terms -1). But I should find the possible values of S and how many states correspond to each S.\n\nWait, let me list all possible states and compute S for each:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:\n   S1S2 = +1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. So S=3.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\n   S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. S = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait no, wait: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So S=-1.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:\n   S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. S = (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:\n   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. So S= (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:\n   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. S= (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\n   S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. S= (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.\n\n7.

S=3.\n\nWait, so looking at all these:\n\nState 1: S=3.\n\nStates 2,3,4,5,6,7: S=-1.\n\nState 8: S=3.\n\nWait, so how many states have S=3? Only states 1 and 8, so two states. Each contributes an S of 3.\n\nAnd the remaining 6 states have S=-1.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recount. Because some of these might have S=3 or S=1 or other values. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait in state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what about other possibilities? Are there any states where S is 1 or -3?\n\nWait, let me think: what is the possible S?\n\nEach term can be +1 or -1, so the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, but in the cases I calculated above, I only got S=3 and S=-1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe there are states where S=1 or S=-3.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nWait for S=1, the sum should be 1.\n\nSo maybe in some states, two terms are +1 and one is -1, leading to S=1.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFor example, state where S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: S=3.\n\nState where S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S=1 -1 -1= -1.\n\nWait, but if two terms are +1 and one is -1, what's the sum?\n\nWait, let's take another state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nSo S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = +1, S2S3 = -1.\n\nSum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nHmm, not 1.\n\nWait, maybe another configuration. Let me think: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: sum 3.\n\nS1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: sum 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nWhat about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: sum is (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some cases where S=1 or S=-3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider all 8 possibilities again.\n\nLet me list all 8 states:\n\n1. All +1: S = 3.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S = (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -3? Wait, no. Wait S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: \n\nS1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1.\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nSo sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nWait, same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps another state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = -1.\n\nS1S3 = -1.\n\nS2S3 = +1.\n\nSum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nHmm, same.\n\nWait, what about S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1: sum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nSame.\n\nWait, S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1: sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nSame.\n\nS1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1: sum is (+1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nSame.\n\nAnd the last state, all -1: sum is 3.\n\nSo I don't see any states where S is 1 or -3. So only two possible S values: 3 and -1.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if all three terms are +1, S=3. If two are +1 and one is -1, then S would be 1 + 1 -1 =1? Or wait, no, because each term is S_i S_j.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in evaluating S. Let me take a different approach.\n\nThe sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nEach term is either +1 or -1. So the possible sums can be:\n\n3 (all +1),\n\n1 (two +1 and one -1),\n\n-1 (two -1 and one +1),\n\n-3 (all -1).\n\nWait, but in my earlier analysis, when I computed all 8 states, I only found S=3 and S=-1. So why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation for some states.\n\nLet me try state 4 again: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1), S1S3 = (-1), S2S3 = (+1).\n\nSo sum is (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.\n\nSo S=-1.\n\nWait, but what if two are +1 and one -1 in the terms. So for example, if two terms are +1 and one is -1, then S=1. But in my earlier analysis, none of the states gave S=1. That suggests that perhaps in this particular setup, S can't be 1 or -3, which doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some states. Let me consider another approach. Perhaps the number of +1 and -1 in the S terms depends on how many pairs are aligned.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of +1 in the three terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3.\n\nEach term is +1 if the spins are aligned, -1 otherwise.\n\nLet me think about the number of aligned pairs in each state.\n\nIn state 1: all aligned. So 3 aligned pairs. So S=3.\n\nIn state 2: two aligned, one not. So two terms +1, one -1. So sum S=1.\n\nWait, wait, I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = +1.\n\nS1S3 = -1.\n\nS2S3 = -1.\n\nSo sum S=1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nHmm, that's -1.\n\nWait, but if two terms are +1 and one is -1, the sum is 1, right? 1 +1 -1 = 1.\n\nWait, but in state 2, sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count how many +1 terms each state has.\n\nWait, another approach: For each state, count the number of +1 in the three terms.\n\nFor example:\n\nState 1: All +1: count is 3 \u2192 S=3.\n\nState 2: S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Count is 1 \u2192 S=1 - 2*(number of -1 terms)? No, wait S is sum of the terms, each term is +1 or -1. So count of +1 terms is n, then S = (n) + (-1)*(3 -n) ) = 2n -3.\n\nSo n can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nSo S can be 2*3-3=3; 2*2-3=1; 2*1-3=-1; 2*0-3=-3.\n\nSo the possible S values are 3,1,-1,-3.\n\nSo I must have missed some states where S=1 or S=-3.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe some states have S=1 or S=-3.\n\nWait, let's take a state where two spins are aligned and one is not. For example:\n\nState where S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: S=3.\n\nState where S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, that's S=-1, but I thought if two are +1 and one is -1, the sum would be 1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the number of aligned pairs. Let me think: for each state, how many pairs are aligned (i.e., S_i S_j = +1).\n\nIn state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nThe pairs are (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).\n\n(1,2) is aligned \u2192 +1.\n\n(1,3) is not aligned \u2192 -1.\n\n(2,3) is not aligned \u2192 -1.\n\nSo two aligned pairs? Wait, no. Only one aligned pair. So number of aligned pairs is 1. So sum S = 1 - 1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier formula S=2n -3, n=1 \u2192 S= -1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: what about a state where two pairs are aligned and one is not?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTake S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. All three pairs are aligned \u2192 n=3 \u2192 S=3.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Only one pair aligned (1,2). So n=1 \u2192 S=-1.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Let's see:\n\nS1S2 = -1 \u2192 not aligned.\n\nS1S3 = +1 \u2192 aligned.\n\nS2S3 = -1 \u2192 not aligned.\n\nSo aligned pairs: only (1,3). n=1 \u2192 S= -1.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2= -1.\n\nS1S3= -1.\n\nS2S3=+1.\n\nSo aligned pairs: only (2,3). So n=1 \u2192 S= -1.\n\nWait, so in all the states I've looked at, n is either 3 or 1, leading to S=3 or S=-1.\n\nSo where are the states with n=2? Like, two aligned pairs.\n\nAh, maybe I'm missing some states where two pairs are aligned and one isn't. Let's think.\n\nWait, for example, can a state have two aligned pairs and one unaligned?\n\nLet's think of a state where S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. All three aligned, n=3.\n\nAnother possibility: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Only one aligned pair.\n\nWait, what about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1?\n\nAs above, that gives n=1.\n\nAnother possibility: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: n=3.\n\nWait, maybe another state: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: n=1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not getting any states with n=2. Let me try to find a state with n=2.\n\nWait, perhaps S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: n=3.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nIn this case:\n\nS1S2=-1.\n\nS1S3=-1.\n\nS2S3=+1.\n\nSo only one aligned pair: (2,3). So n=1 \u2192 S=-1.\n\nHmm, I'm not finding any state where n=2, which would lead to S=1.\n\nWait, maybe such a state doesn't exist. Let me think: is there a state where exactly two pairs are aligned?\n\nWait, perhaps if two spins are +1, and one is -1, but arranged in a way that two pairs are aligned.\n\nWait, let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. All aligned, n=3.\n\nOr, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Only one pair aligned.\n\nWait, perhaps another scenario: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: n=3.\n\nWait, perhaps there's no state with n=2, meaning S cannot be 1 or -3. So maybe the possible S values are 3 and -1.\n\nBut that seems odd. Let me think again. Maybe my earlier analysis was correct, and in this setup, S can only take 3 and -1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake in how S is computed. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAnother approach: the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nEach term is either +1 or -1.\n\nLet me consider all possible combinations of the three terms.\n\nEach term can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3=8 possible combinations for the sum S.\n\nBut in reality, not all combinations are possible because the terms are not independent. For example, S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are products of the same variables, so their values are not independent.\n\nWait, for example, if S1S2=+1 and S1S3=+1, then S2 and S3 must be equal. Because S1S2=+1 implies S2=S1. Similarly, S1S3=+1 implies S3=S1. So S2 and S3 are same, so S2S3=+1.\n\nSo in this case, all three terms are +1. So S=3.\n\nAnother case: S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1.\n\nWait, but if S1S2=+1 and S1S3=+1, then S2=S1 and S3=S1. So S2=S3. Thus, S2S3=+1, not -1. So this combination is impossible.\n\nSo, the sum S can't be any arbitrary combination of the three terms. So possible S values are limited.\n\nSo let's list all possible combinations of the three terms that are possible, given that they are not independent.\n\nPossible cases:\n\n1. All three terms are +1: sum S=3.\n\n2. Two terms are +1, one is -1. But wait, can that happen?\n\nWait, if two terms are +1, the third must also be +1, because if S1S2=+1 and S1S3=+1, then S2 and S3 are same as S1, so S2S3=+1.\n\nThus, the only possible way for two terms to be +1 is when all three are +1.\n\nSimilarly, for two terms to be -1, but that might not be possible.\n\nWait, perhaps another scenario: suppose S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2=+1 \u2192 S2=S1.\n\nS1S3=-1 \u2192 S3 = -S1.\n\nThen S2S3 = S1*(-S1) )= -S1^2 = -1, since S1 is \u00b11.\n\nSo in this case, all three terms would be S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.\n\nSo sum S=1 -1 -1= -1.\n\nAnother scenario: S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2=-1 \u2192 S2 = -S1.\n\nS1S3=+1 \u2192 S3=S1.\n\nS2S3 = (-S1)(S1) )= -S1^2 = -1.\n\nSo the three terms are -1, +1, -1 \u2192 sum S= -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nAnother case: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1.\n\nSo S1S2=-1 \u2192 S2=-S1.\n\nS1S3=-1 \u2192 S3 = -S1.\n\nS2S3 = (-S1)(-S1) )= S1^2 = +1.\n\nSo terms: -1, -1, +1 \u2192 sum S= -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nAnother case: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2=-1 \u2192 S2=-S1.\n\nS1S3=-1 \u2192 S3=-S1.\n\nS2S3 = (-S1)(-S1) )= +1.\n\nSo terms: -1, -1, +1 \u2192 sum S=-1.\n\nWait, but in this case, the sum is -1 again.\n\nSo, from these possibilities, the only possible sum values are S=3 and S=-1.\n\nSo that suggests that the possible S values are 3 and -1, and the number of states for each S.\n\nNow, let's count how many states have S=3 and S=-1.\n\nFrom earlier analysis, states where all three spins are +1 or all are -1 have S=3. So that's two states.\n\nAll other states have S=-1.\n\nSo total number of states: 8.\n\nNumber of states with S=3: 2.\n\nNumber of states with S=-1: 6.\n\nWait, earlier when I considered all 8 states, 6 of them had S=-1 and 2 had S=3.\n\nSo for each state, the energy is E = -J S.\n\nSo for S=3, E = -J *3.\n\nFor S=-1, E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, no: E = -J * S.\n\nSo if S=3, E = -3J.\n\nIf S=-1, E = J.\n\nWait, no: S=-1 \u2192 E= -J * (-1) = J.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nSo for each state, the energy is E = -J S.\n\nNow, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp( -\u03b2 E ), where \u03b2=1/(kT).\n\nSo for each state, the term is exp( \u03b2 J S ), since E=-J S \u2192 -\u03b2 E = \u03b2 J S.\n\nSo for S=3, the term is exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nFor S=-1, the term is exp( (-1)*\u03b2 J ) = exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nNow, each of the two states with S=3 contributes exp(3 \u03b2 J), and each of the six states with S=-1 contributes exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nSo Z = 2 * exp(3 \u03b2 J) + 6 * exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: Z=2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6 e^{J\u03b2}.\n\nNo, because for S=3, it's e^{3\u03b2J}, but option A has e^{-3\u03b2J}.\n\nOption B: Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}. Yes, that matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, when S=3, E = -3J \u2192 -\u03b2 E = 3 \u03b2 J \u2192 exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nWhen S=-1, E= J \u2192 -\u03b2 E = -\u03b2 J \u2192 exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nYes, so Z is 2 exp(3 \u03b2 J) + 6 exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B: 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again:\n\nOption A) Z=2e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2)\n\nOption B) Z=2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nOption C) Z=2e^(2J\u03b2)+6e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nOption D) Z=6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nTo find the partition function \\( Z \\) for the given system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\), and the energy is \\( E = -J [S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Energy Expression**: The energy depends on the sum \\( S = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \\), which can take values \\( 3, 1, -1, -3 \\) depending on the alignment of the spins. However, through analysis of all possible states, it is found that \\( S \\) can only take values \\( 3 \\) and \\( -1 \\) in this system.\n\n2. **Possible States**:\n   - **States with \\( S = 3 \\)**: These occur when all three spins are aligned (either all \\( +1 \\) or all \\( -1 \\)). There are **2 such states**.\n   - **States with \\( S = -1 \\)**: These occur in all other cases, where two spins are aligned and one is opposite. There are **6 such states**.\n\n3. **Energy for Each State**:\n   - For \\( S = 3 \\): \\( E = -J \\cdot 3 \\), so the contribution to the partition function is \\( \\exp(-\\beta E) = \\exp(3\\beta J) \\).\n   - For \\( S = -1 \\): \\( E = -J \\cdot (-1) = J \\), so the contribution to the partition function is \\( \\exp(-\\beta E) = \\exp(-\\beta J) \\).\n\n4. **Partition Function**:\n   - The partition function is the sum of contributions from all states:\n     \\[\n     Z = 2 \\cdot \\exp(3\\beta J) + 6 \\cdot \\exp(-\\beta J).\n     \\]\n\n### Evaluation of Options:\n- **Option A**: \\( Z = 2e^{-3J\\beta} + 6e^{J\\beta} \\).  \n  Incorrect, as the exponent for \\( S = 3 \\) should be \\( +3J\\beta \\), not \\( -3J\\beta \\).\n\n- **Option B**: \\( Z = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta} \\).  \n  Correct, matches the derived partition function.\n\n- **Option C**: \\( Z = 2e^{2J\\beta} + 6e^{-2J\\beta} \\).  \n  Incorrect, as the exponents do not match the derived values.\n\n- **Option D**: \\( Z = 6e^{2J\\beta} + 2e^{-2J\\beta} \\).  \n  Incorrect, as the exponents and coefficients do not match the derived values.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct partition function is \\( Z = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta} \\), which corresponds to **Option B**.\n\n**Answer: B**",
