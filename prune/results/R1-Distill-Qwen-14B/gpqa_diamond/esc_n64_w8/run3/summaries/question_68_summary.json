      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I remember from my notes that spin 1/2 particles have some interesting magnetic properties. Alright, let's go through the question step by step.\n\nThe problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is equal to gamma times S_z. So mu = \u03b3 S_z. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. That makes sense because the lowest energy state would have the magnetic moment aligned with the field.\n\nThen, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So the initial magnetic field was B in +Z, then it's switched to B in +Y.\n\nThe question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So we're looking at the expectation value of S_z over time, and it's oscillating. I need to find the frequency of that oscillation.\n\nWait, I think I remember something about time-dependent perturbations and transition probabilities. But wait, in this case, the system undergoes a sudden change in the magnetic field. So the particle's spin state might change, and we have to find how S_z evolves over time.\n\nLet me think about the initial state. Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the particle's magnetic moment is aligned. That suggests the spin is in the eigenstate of S_z. For spin 1/2, the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues \u0127/2 and -\u0127/2 respectively. So the initial state is |+z> because the magnetic moment is aligned with B.\n\nWhen the field is suddenly switched off and turned on along +Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The initial Hamiltonian was H_initial = -\u03bc\u00b7B_initial. Since B was along +Z, H_initial was proportional to S_z. After the change, the Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -\u03bc\u00b7B_final, which is proportional to S_y because B is now along +Y.\n\nWait, but when the field is turned off, what's the system's state? Oh, I think the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously when the Hamiltonian changes. So the initial state is still |+z> but the Hamiltonian now is proportional to S_y. So the time evolution will be governed by the new Hamiltonian.\n\nSo the new Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. Let's write it out. H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S_z * B, but wait, after the switch, it's along Y. So H = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nWait, actually, let me get the signs right. The magnetic moment is mu = \u03b3 S_z. So the magnetic dipole energy is -mu\u00b7B. So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B.\n\nSo in the initial state, H_initial was along Z: H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B = - \u03b3 S_z B. After the switch, H_final = - mu \u00b7 B_new = - \u03b3 S_z * (0 in Z direction) + \u03b3 S_y * B (since B is along Y).\n\nWait, no, because B is along Y, so the dot product would be in the Y direction. So H_final = - mu \u00b7 B = - (gamma S_z) * (B_y direction?), wait, no. Wait, mu is a vector. So mu = gamma S_z, but wait, S_z is the operator. So the magnetic moment is proportional to S, which has components S_x, S_y, S_z. So when the magnetic field is along Y, mu \u00b7 B would be mu_y * B, where mu_y is gamma S_y. So H_final = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo H = - gamma B S_y. But S_y has units of \u0127/2. So let me express H in terms of \u0127. S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y, where \u03c3_y is the Pauli matrix.\n\nSo H = - gamma B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. Let me write that as H = ( - gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) \u03c3_y.\n\nBut wait, in quantum mechanics, the energy is often written as (E) with factors of \u0127. So perhaps it's better to express H in terms of angular frequency. Let me think: The energy levels of a spin in a magnetic field are given by E = \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2). So in this case, the system will have a time evolution determined by the energy splitting.\n\nBut wait, the Hamiltonian is proportional to \u03c3_y, which doesn't commute with S_z. So the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian will be different from the initial state.\n\nThe initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. But now the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so the eigenstates are eigenstates of S_y.\n\nSo the state |+z> can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of H. Let me recall that the eigenstates of S_y are (|+y> and |-y>). The |+y> state is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Because when you add |+y> and |-y>, each is a combination of |+z> and |-z>, so adding them gives (|+z> + |-z> + |+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) = (2|+z> )/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)|+z>. So I think I mixed up the coefficients. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). So if I take |+z>, it's equal to (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Because:\n\n(|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) = [ (|+z> + |-z> ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) ]/(2)\n= [2|+z> ]/(2)\n= |+z>.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the initial state is a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe eigenstates of H (which is proportional to S_y) are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues E_+ and E_-. Let's compute the energies.\n\nH = - gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues of H are E_\u00b1 = - gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2 ), because S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nWait, no, let's compute H properly. The spin operator S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So H |+y> = [ - gamma B ( \u0127/2 ) ] |+y>, and H |-y> = [ + gamma B ( \u0127/2 ) ] |-y>.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me see: S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So when you apply H = - gamma B S_y to |+y>, you get H |+y> = - gamma B ( \u0127/2 ) |+y>, which is E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127/2 ). Similarly, E_- = + (gamma B \u0127/2 ).\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = - gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y> \u2192 E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127/2 ). Similarly, E_- = + (gamma B \u0127/2 ), since S_y |-y> = - (\u0127/2) |-y> \u2192 H |-y> = gamma B (\u0127/2 ) |-y>.\n\nWait, so the energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127/2 ), E_- = + (gamma B \u0127/2 ). So the energy splitting is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). So the time evolution under H will cause each component to acquire a phase factor. Let me write the state as a time-dependent function.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ). So each eigenstate |E> evolves as exp( -i E t / \u0127 ).\n\nSo the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Under H, each term picks up a phase.\n\nSo at time t, the state is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) |+y> + exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nPlugging in E_+ and E_-:\n\n= [ exp( -i (-gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n= [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, I need to find the expectation value of S_z, which is <S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nLet me compute this expectation value.\n\nFirst, let's express S_z in terms of the |+y> and |-y> basis. I know that S_z can be expressed in terms of S_x and S_y, but perhaps it's easier to write it in terms of the Pauli matrices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> by expanding |\u03c8(t)> and using the expectation value.\n\nWait, let me write the state |\u03c8(t)> more clearly.\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nLet me compute <S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nSince S_z is Hermitian, and the state is normalized, this expectation value should be real.\n\nExpressing S_z in terms of the |+y> and |-y> basis. I know that the eigenstates of S_z are |+z> and |-z>, which we've already expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express S_z in terms of the |+y> and |-y> basis.\n\nWait, let's recall that:\n\nS_z = (\u0127/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSimilarly, S_y = (\u0127/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nThe |+y> and |-y> states can be written as:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 1]^T\n\nSimilarly, |-y> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, -1]^T\n\nSo to express S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis, I can write it as a matrix.\n\nIn the |+y>, |-y> basis, the matrix for S_z is:\n\nS_z = (\u0127/2) [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ]\n\nBut wait, in the |+y> basis, the matrix representation of S_z would be:\n\nS_z = (\u0127/2) [ < +y | S_z | +y >, < +y | S_z | -y >;\n               < -y | S_z | +y >, < -y | S_z | -y > ]\n\nCompute each element:\n\n< +y | S_z | +y > = (\u0127/2) (1) [ because |+y> is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), so when you apply S_z, you get (1)(|+z> )/sqrt(2) + (-1)(|-z> )/sqrt(2). The inner product with |+y> is [ (1)(1) + (-1)(-1) ] / 2 = (1 +1)/2 = 1. So < +y | S_z | +y > = (\u0127/2)(1).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that |+y> is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), so applying S_z gives (S_z |+z> + S_z |-z>)/sqrt(2) = ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2) = (\u0127/2) (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = (\u0127/2) | -y >.\n\nWait, so S_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) | -y >. Similarly, S_z |-y> = (\u0127/2) | +y >.\n\nSo in the |+y>, |-y> basis, the matrix for S_z is:\n\n[ [0, \u0127/2], [ \u0127/2, 0 ] ]\n\nBecause:\n\nS_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) |-y> \u2192 first column is [0, \u0127/2]^T\n\nS_z |-y> = (\u0127/2) |+y> \u2192 second column is [ \u0127/2, 0 ]^T.\n\nWait, no, because matrix elements are < basis | S_z | basis >.\n\nSo the matrix elements are:\n\nRow 1, column 1: < +y | S_z | +y > \u2192 which is (1/2) \u0127 (since S_z |+y> = \u0127/2 | -y >, so when you take inner product with |+y>, it's zero. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to compute it explicitly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach is better. Let's compute < S_z > directly using the state |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nGiven |\u03c8(t)> = [ e^{i a t} |+y> + e^{-i a t} |-y> ] / sqrt(2), where a = gamma B / 2.\n\nThen, the expectation value is:\n\n< S_z > = [ e^{i a t} |+y> + e^{-i a t} |-y> ]^\u2020 (1/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] [ e^{i a t} |+y> + e^{-i a t} |-y> ] / 2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled. Let me compute the inner product step by step.\n\nCompute <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nFirst, write |\u03c8(t)> as ( e^{i a t} |+y> + e^{-i a t} |-y> ) / sqrt(2), where a = (gamma B)/2.\n\nThen, S_z |\u03c8(t)> is ( e^{i a t} S_z |+y> + e^{-i a t} S_z |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nFrom earlier, S_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) |-y>, and S_z |-y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nSo S_z |\u03c8(t)> = ( e^{i a t} (\u0127/2) |-y> + e^{-i a t} (\u0127/2) |+y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, <\u03c8(t)| is ( e^{-i a t} < +y | + e^{i a t} < -y | ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the inner product <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)> is:\n\n[ e^{-i a t} < +y | + e^{i a t} < -y | ] / sqrt(2) * [ e^{i a t} (\u0127/2) |-y> + e^{-i a t} (\u0127/2) |+y> ] / sqrt(2) )\n\nMultiply the numerators:\n\n= [ e^{-i a t} < +y | + e^{i a t} < -y | ] [ e^{i a t} (\u0127/2) |-y> + e^{-i a t} (\u0127/2) |+y> ] / (2)\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= [ e^{-i a t} * e^{i a t} (\u0127/2) < +y | -y > + e^{-i a t} * e^{-i a t} (\u0127/2) < +y | +y > + e^{i a t} * e^{i a t} (\u0127/2) < -y | -y > + e^{i a t} * e^{-i a t} (\u0127/2) < -y | +y > ] / 2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n1. e^{-i a t} * e^{i a t} = 1 \u2192 term is (\u0127/2) < +y | -y > = 0.\n\n2. e^{-i a t} * e^{-i a t} = e^{-2 i a t} \u2192 term is (\u0127/2) < +y | +y > = (\u0127/2)(1).\n\n3. e^{i a t} * e^{i a t} = e^{2 i a t} \u2192 term is (\u0127/2) < -y | -y > = (\u0127/2)(1).\n\n4. e^{i a t} * e^{-i a t} = 1 \u2192 term is (\u0127/2) < -y | +y > = 0.\n\nSo combining the non-zero terms:\n\n= [ (\u0127/2)(1) e^{-2 i a t} + (\u0127/2)(1) e^{2 i a t} ] / 2\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ e^{-2 i a t} + e^{2 i a t} ] / 2\n\n= (\u0127/4) [ e^{2 i a t} + e^{-2 i a t} ]\n\nWhich is (\u0127/4)(2 cos(2 a t )) \u2192 (\u0127/2) cos(2 a t )\n\nSo < S_z > = ( \u0127/2 ) cos( 2 a t )\n\nBut a = gamma B / 2, so 2 a = gamma B.\n\nSo < S_z > = ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but wait, the problem states that mu = gamma S_z. So the average z-component of the particle\u2019s moment is mu_z = gamma < S_z >.\n\nBecause S_z has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so < S_z > has units of \u0127/2. So mu_z = gamma * < S_z >.\n\nSo mu_z = gamma * ( \u0127/2 cos( gamma B t ) )\n\nBut mu itself is gamma S_z, so mu_z = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation is in cos( gamma B t ), which has a frequency of gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. The oscillation frequency is the coefficient inside the cosine. The function cos(omega t) has frequency omega/(2 pi), but when someone says oscillation frequency, they often refer to omega. So in this case, the frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is gamma B, option A is gamma B/2, etc.\n\nWait, but wait, in the calculation, the < S_z > oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B. So the average of mu_z (which is gamma < S_z > ) oscillates at the same frequency.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.\n\nThe < S_z > was found to be ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t ), right?\n\nSo mu_z = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma S_z. So mu_z = gamma < S_z >.\n\nSo the oscillation of mu_z is proportional to cos( gamma B t ), which oscillates at frequency gamma B.\n\nSo the average oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the energy levels again. The energy difference between the two eigenstates is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127. The frequency of oscillation in energy would be (E_- - E_+)/\u0127 = gamma B.\n\nBut the oscillation in expectation values like <S_z> would have a frequency related to the energy splitting. The time evolution of the state is governed by the energy difference, so the oscillation frequency is (E_+ - E_- ) / \u0127.\n\nWait, but in the state |\u03c8(t)>, the phase difference between |+y> and |-y> is 2 E t / \u0127. So the relative phase is 2 (E_- - E_+) t / \u0127.\n\nWait, E_- is larger than E_+ by gamma B \u0127. So the relative phase is 2 (gamma B \u0127) t / \u0127 = 2 gamma B t.\n\nSo the beat frequency, which is the frequency at which the expectation values oscillate, is 2 gamma B / (2 pi) )? Wait, no, because the cosine comes from the interference of the two phases. So when you have two states with energies E_+ and E_-, the interference leads to oscillations at frequency (E_- - E_+ ) / \u0127.\n\nBecause the time dependence is e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} and e^{-i E_- t/ \u0127 }, their difference leads to a term like e^{i (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 }, which oscillates at (E_- - E_+ ) / \u0127.\n\nSo (E_- - E_+ ) = (gamma B \u0127/2 ) - ( - gamma B \u0127/2 ) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the frequency is (gamma B \u0127 ) / \u0127 ) = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nSo the answer should be B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I remember from my notes that spin 1/2 particles have some interesting magnetic properties. Alright, let's go through the question step by step.\n\nThe problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is equal to gamma times S_z. So mu = \u03b3 S_z. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. That makes sense because the lowest energy state would have the magnetic moment aligned with the field.\n\nThen, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So the initial magnetic field was B in +Z, then it's switched to B in +Y.\n\nThe question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So we're looking at the expectation value of S_z over time, and it's oscillating. I need to find the frequency of that oscillation.\n\nWait, I think I remember something about time-dependent perturbations and transition probabilities. But wait, in this case, the system undergoes a sudden change in the magnetic field. So the particle's spin state might change, and we have to find how S_z evolves over time.\n\nLet me think about the initial state. Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the particle's magnetic moment is aligned. That suggests the spin is in the eigenstate of S_z. For spin 1/2, the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues \u0127/2 and -\u0127/2 respectively. So the initial state is |+z> because the magnetic moment is aligned with B.\n\nWhen the field is suddenly switched off and turned on along +Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The initial Hamiltonian was H_initial = -\u03bc\u00b7B_initial. Since B was along +Z, H_initial was proportional to S_z. After the change, the Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -\u03bc\u00b7B_final, which is proportional to S_y because B is now along +Y.\n\nWait, but when the field is turned off, what's the system's state? Oh, I think the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously when the Hamiltonian changes. So the initial state is still |+z> but the Hamiltonian now is proportional to S_y. So the time evolution will be governed by the new Hamiltonian.\n\nSo the new Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. Let's write it out. H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S_z * B, but wait, after the switch, it's along Y. So H = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nWait, actually, let me get the signs right. The magnetic moment is mu = \u03b3 S_z. So the magnetic dipole energy is -mu\u00b7B. So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B.\n\nSo in the initial state, H_initial was along Z: H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B = - \u03b3 S_z B. After the switch, H_final = - mu \u00b7 B_new = - \u03b3 S_z * (0 in Z direction) + \u03b3 S_y * B (since B is along Y).\n\nWait, no, because B is along Y, so the dot product would be in the Y direction. So H_final = - mu \u00b7 B = - (gamma S_z) * (B_y direction?), wait, no. Wait, mu is a vector. So mu = gamma S_z, but wait, S_z is the operator. So the magnetic moment is proportional to S, which has components S_x, S_y, S_z. So when the magnetic field is along Y, mu \u00b7 B would be mu_y * B, where mu_y is gamma S_y. So H_final = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo H = - gamma B S_y. But S_y has units of \u0127/2. So let me express H in terms of \u0127. S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y, where \u03c3_y is the Pauli matrix.\n\nSo H = - gamma B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. Let me write that as H = ( - gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) \u03c3_y.\n\nBut wait, in quantum mechanics, the energy is often written as (E) with factors of \u0127. So perhaps it's better to express H in terms of angular frequency. Let me think: The energy levels of a spin in a magnetic field are given by E = \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2). So in this case, the system will have a time evolution determined by the energy splitting.\n\nBut wait, the Hamiltonian is proportional to \u03c3_y, which doesn't commute with S_z. So the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian will be different from the initial state.\n\nThe initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. But now the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so the eigenstates are eigenstates of S_y.\n\nSo the state |+z> can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of H. Let me recall that the eigenstates of S_y are (|+y> and |-y>). The |+y> state is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Because when you add |+y> and |-y>, each is a combination of |+z> and |-z>, so adding them gives (|+z> + |-z> + |+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) = (2|+z> )/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)|+z>. So I think I mixed up the coefficients. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). So if I take |+z>, it's equal to (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Because:\n\n(|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) = [ (|+z> + |-z> ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) ]/(2)\n= [2|+z> ]/(2)\n= |+z>.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the initial state is a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe eigenstates of H (which is proportional to S_y) are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues E_+ and E_-. Let's compute the energies.\n\nH = - gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues of H are E_\u00b1 = - gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2 ), because S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nWait, no, let's compute H properly. The spin operator S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So H |+y> = [ - gamma B ( \u0127/2 ) ] |+y>, and H |-y> = [ + gamma B ( \u0127/2 ) ] |-y>.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me see: S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So when you apply H = - gamma B S_y to |+y>, you get H |+y> = - gamma B ( \u0127/2 ) |+y>, which is E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127/2 ). Similarly, E_- = + (gamma B \u0127/2 ).\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = - gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y> \u2192 E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127/2 ). Similarly, E_- = + (gamma B \u0127/2 ), since S_y |-y> = - (\u0127/2) |-y> \u2192 H |-y> = gamma B (\u0127/2 ) |-y>.\n\nWait, so the energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127/2 ), E_- = + (gamma B \u0127/2 ). So the energy splitting is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). So the time evolution under H will cause each component to acquire a phase factor. Let me write the state as a time-dependent function.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ). So each eigenstate |E> evolves as exp( -i E t / \u0127 ).\n\nSo the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Under H, each term picks up a phase.\n\nSo at time t, the state is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) |+y> + exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nPlugging in E_+ and E_-:\n\n= [ exp( -i (-gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n= [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, I need to find the expectation value of S_z, which is <S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nLet me compute this expectation value.\n\nFirst, let's express S_z in terms of the |+y> and |-y> basis. I know that S_z can be expressed in terms of S_x and S_y, but perhaps it's easier to write it in terms of the Pauli matrices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> by expanding |\u03c8(t)> and using the expectation value.\n\nWait, let me write the state |\u03c8(t)> more clearly.\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nLet me compute <S_z> = <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nSince S_z is Hermitian, and the state is normalized, this expectation value should be real.\n\nExpressing S_z in terms of the |+y> and |-y> basis. I know that the eigenstates of S_z are |+z> and |-z>, which we've already expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express S_z in terms of the |+y> and |-y> basis.\n\nWait, let's recall that:\n\nS_z = (\u0127/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSimilarly, S_y = (\u0127/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nThe |+y> and |-y> states can be written as:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 1]^T\n\nSimilarly, |-y> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, -1]^T\n\nSo to express S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis, I can write it as a matrix.\n\nIn the |+y>, |-y> basis, the matrix for S_z is:\n\nS_z = (\u0127/2) [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ]\n\nBut wait, in the |+y> basis, the matrix representation of S_z would be:\n\nS_z = (\u0127/2) [ < +y | S_z | +y >, < +y | S_z | -y >;\n               < -y | S_z | +y >, < -y | S_z | -y > ]\n\nCompute each element:\n\n< +y | S_z | +y > = (\u0127/2) (1) [ because |+y> is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), so when you apply S_z, you get (1)(|+z> )/sqrt(2) + (-1)(|-z> )/sqrt(2). The inner product with |+y> is [ (1)(1) + (-1)(-1) ] / 2 = (1 +1)/2 = 1. So < +y | S_z | +y > = (\u0127/2)(1).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that |+y> is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), so applying S_z gives (S_z |+z> + S_z |-z>)/sqrt(2) = ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2) = (\u0127/2) (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = (\u0127/2) | -y >.\n\nWait, so S_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) | -y >. Similarly, S_z |-y> = (\u0127/2) | +y >.\n\nSo in the |+y>, |-y> basis, the matrix for S_z is:\n\n[ [0, \u0127/2], [ \u0127/2, 0 ] ]\n\nBecause:\n\nS_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) |-y> \u2192 first column is [0, \u0127/2]^T\n\nS_z |-y> = (\u0127/2) |+y> \u2192 second column is [ \u0127/2, 0 ]^T.\n\nWait, no, because matrix elements are < basis | S_z | basis >.\n\nSo the matrix elements are:\n\nRow 1, column 1: < +y | S_z | +y > \u2192 which is (1/2) \u0127 (since S_z |+y> = \u0127/2 | -y >, so when you take inner product with |+y>, it's zero. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to compute it explicitly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach is better. Let's compute < S_z > directly using the state |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nGiven |\u03c8(t)> = [ e^{i a t} |+y> + e^{-i a t} |-y> ] / sqrt(2), where a = gamma B / 2.\n\nThen, the expectation value is:\n\n< S_z > = [ e^{i a t} |+y> + e^{-i a t} |-y> ]^\u2020 (1/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] [ e^{i a t} |+y> + e^{-i a t} |-y> ] / 2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled. Let me compute the inner product step by step.\n\nCompute <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nFirst, write |\u03c8(t)> as ( e^{i a t} |+y> + e^{-i a t} |-y> ) / sqrt(2), where a = (gamma B)/2.\n\nThen, S_z |\u03c8(t)> is ( e^{i a t} S_z |+y> + e^{-i a t} S_z |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nFrom earlier, S_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) |-y>, and S_z |-y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nSo S_z |\u03c8(t)> = ( e^{i a t} (\u0127/2) |-y> + e^{-i a t} (\u0127/2) |+y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, <\u03c8(t)| is ( e^{-i a t} < +y | + e^{i a t} < -y | ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the inner product <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)> is:\n\n[ e^{-i a t} < +y | + e^{i a t} < -y | ] / sqrt(2) * [ e^{i a t} (\u0127/2) |-y> + e^{-i a t} (\u0127/2) |+y> ] / sqrt(2) )\n\nMultiply the numerators:\n\n= [ e^{-i a t} < +y | + e^{i a t} < -y | ] [ e^{i a t} (\u0127/2) |-y> + e^{-i a t} (\u0127/2) |+y> ] / (2)\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= [ e^{-i a t} * e^{i a t} (\u0127/2) < +y | -y > + e^{-i a t} * e^{-i a t} (\u0127/2) < +y | +y > + e^{i a t} * e^{i a t} (\u0127/2) < -y | -y > + e^{i a t} * e^{-i a t} (\u0127/2) < -y | +y > ] / 2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n1. e^{-i a t} * e^{i a t} = 1 \u2192 term is (\u0127/2) < +y | -y > = 0.\n\n2. e^{-i a t} * e^{-i a t} = e^{-2 i a t} \u2192 term is (\u0127/2) < +y | +y > = (\u0127/2)(1).\n\n3. e^{i a t} * e^{i a t} = e^{2 i a t} \u2192 term is (\u0127/2) < -y | -y > = (\u0127/2)(1).\n\n4. e^{i a t} * e^{-i a t} = 1 \u2192 term is (\u0127/2) < -y | +y > = 0.\n\nSo combining the non-zero terms:\n\n= [ (\u0127/2)(1) e^{-2 i a t} + (\u0127/2)(1) e^{2 i a t} ] / 2\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ e^{-2 i a t} + e^{2 i a t} ] / 2\n\n= (\u0127/4) [ e^{2 i a t} + e^{-2 i a t} ]\n\nWhich is (\u0127/4)(2 cos(2 a t )) \u2192 (\u0127/2) cos(2 a t )\n\nSo < S_z > = ( \u0127/2 ) cos( 2 a t )\n\nBut a = gamma B / 2, so 2 a = gamma B.\n\nSo < S_z > = ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but wait, the problem states that mu = gamma S_z. So the average z-component of the particle\u2019s moment is mu_z = gamma < S_z >.\n\nBecause S_z has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so < S_z > has units of \u0127/2. So mu_z = gamma * < S_z >.\n\nSo mu_z = gamma * ( \u0127/2 cos( gamma B t ) )\n\nBut mu itself is gamma S_z, so mu_z = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation is in cos( gamma B t ), which has a frequency of gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. The oscillation frequency is the coefficient inside the cosine. The function cos(omega t) has frequency omega/(2 pi), but when someone says oscillation frequency, they often refer to omega. So in this case, the frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is gamma B, option A is gamma B/2, etc.\n\nWait, but wait, in the calculation, the < S_z > oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B. So the average of mu_z (which is gamma < S_z > ) oscillates at the same frequency.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.\n\nThe < S_z > was found to be ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t ), right?\n\nSo mu_z = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma S_z. So mu_z = gamma < S_z >.\n\nSo the oscillation of mu_z is proportional to cos( gamma B t ), which oscillates at frequency gamma B.\n\nSo the average oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the energy levels again. The energy difference between the two eigenstates is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127. The frequency of oscillation in energy would be (E_- - E_+)/\u0127 = gamma B.\n\nBut the oscillation in expectation values like <S_z> would have a frequency related to the energy splitting. The time evolution of the state is governed by the energy difference, so the oscillation frequency is (E_+ - E_- ) / \u0127.\n\nWait, but in the state |\u03c8(t)>, the phase difference between |+y> and |-y> is 2 E t / \u0127. So the relative phase is 2 (E_- - E_+) t / \u0127.\n\nWait, E_- is larger than E_+ by gamma B \u0127. So the relative phase is 2 (gamma B \u0127) t / \u0127 = 2 gamma B t.\n\nSo the beat frequency, which is the frequency at which the expectation values oscillate, is 2 gamma B / (2 pi) )? Wait, no, because the cosine comes from the interference of the two phases. So when you have two states with energies E_+ and E_-, the interference leads to oscillations at frequency (E_- - E_+ ) / \u0127.\n\nBecause the time dependence is e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} and e^{-i E_- t/ \u0127 }, their difference leads to a term like e^{i (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 }, which oscillates at (E_- - E_+ ) / \u0127.\n\nSo (E_- - E_+ ) = (gamma B \u0127/2 ) - ( - gamma B \u0127/2 ) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the frequency is (gamma B \u0127 ) / \u0127 ) = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nSo the answer should be B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then suddenly switched off and turned on along the $+Y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State**:  \n   The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\\rangle$, since the magnetic moment is aligned with the initial $+Z$ field.\n\n2. **New Hamiltonian**:  \n   After the magnetic field is switched to $+Y$, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to $S_y$:  \n   \\[\n   H = -\\gamma B S_y\n   \\]  \n   The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\\pm \\hbar/2$. The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of these eigenstates:  \n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle \\right)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Time Evolution**:  \n   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:  \n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{-i\\omega_+ t} |+y\\rangle + e^{-i\\omega_- t} |-y\\rangle \\right)\n   \\]  \n   where $\\omega_\\pm = \\pm \\frac{\\gamma B}{2}$ are the energy eigenfrequencies.\n\n4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  \n   The expectation value of $S_z$ is given by:  \n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the time-evolved state and using the fact that $S_z$ in the $|+y\\rangle, |-y\\rangle$ basis has the matrix representation:  \n   \\[\n   S_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix},\n   \\]  \n   the calculation yields:  \n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Oscillation Frequency**:  \n   The oscillation of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ is governed by the $\\cos(\\gamma B t)$ term, which oscillates at a frequency of $\\gamma B$. Since $\\mu_z = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle$, the magnetic moment $\\mu_z$ oscillates at the same frequency.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$, corresponding to **Option B**.\n\nANSWER: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nSo the setup is: there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma times Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, the magnetic moment mu is mu = gamma * Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin in the z-direction. So the magnetic moment is proportional to spin. Got it.\n\nInitially, the field is along +Z, so the particle's spin will align with it. The energy levels for spin-1/2 in a magnetic field B along Z are given by E = -mu\u00b7B. So since mu is gamma Sz, then E = -gamma Sz B. But for spin-1/2, Sz can be \u00b1 \u0127/2. Wait, actually, in terms of units, maybe I should think in terms of eigenvalues. Spin matrices have eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 for Sz, so the energies would be E = -gamma * (\u0127/2) * B for spin-up and similarly for spin-down.\n\nBut then the field is switched off and turned on along Y. So now the magnetic field is B in the Y direction. The magnetic moment will now precess around Y? Or maybe the spin state will evolve under the new Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, when the field changes, the Hamiltonian changes. The initial state was an eigenstate of the old Hamiltonian (along Z). When the Hamiltonian changes, the state doesn't change instantaneously, but the time evolution will be governed by the new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe new Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B', where B' is along Y. So mu is gamma Sz, and B' is in Y. So H = -gamma B (Sz * Y direction?), wait, no. Wait, the dot product is in the Y direction. So H = -gamma B (S_y), because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, and the field is along Y, so the interaction is mu \u00b7 B = gamma S \u00b7 B. Since B is along Y, S \u00b7 B is S_y * B.\n\nWait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the Hamiltonian H is -mu \u00b7 B. So H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, let me think. The magnetic dipole energy is H = -mu \u00b7 B. Since mu = gamma S, then H = -gamma (S \u00b7 B). When B is along Y, S \u00b7 B is S_y * B. So H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nBut wait, S_y is an operator. The initial state was an eigenstate of Sz, say |+z> or |-z>. So when the field is along Y, the system's state is no longer an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time.\n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z = gamma <Sz>. So we need to find how <Sz> oscillates over time.\n\nTo find the oscillation frequency, I think we can model the time evolution of the expectation value. The general approach for such problems is to find the time dependence of <Sz> under the new Hamiltonian H.\n\nSo the initial state is |psi(0)> = |+z> or |-z>, I suppose. Let's say it's |+z> for simplicity. But wait, when the field was along Z, the particle's spin is aligned. So initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, either up or down.\n\nAfter the field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. So the time evolution is given by the exponential of -i H t / \u0127.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The new H is proportional to S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y> states.\n\nWait, the eigenstates of S_y are (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) and (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2), right? Or maybe I have the signs mixed up. Let me recall: S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2)|+y>, and similarly for |-y>.\n\nSo |+y> is (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2), if I remember correctly. Or wait, maybe it's without the i? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about the matrix representation.\n\nThe spin matrices: Sx, Sy, Sz. The eigenstates of Sy are the same as Sx but rotated by 90 degrees. So for S_y, the eigenstates are |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) multiplied by some phase factors. Wait, actually, when you have S_y, the eigenstates are (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2) and (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2), because the ladder operators have i's involved. So I think that's right.\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nWait, let me express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:\n\n|+z> = [ |+y> + |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nIs that correct? Wait, let me think again. The eigenstates of Sy are:\n\n|+y> = (|0> + |1>) / sqrt(2) for spin-up, but perhaps with some phase factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2). So if I add |+y> and |-y>, I get (|+z> + i |-z> + |+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2) = (2 |+z> )/ sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) |+z>.\n\nWait, that would imply |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2). Wait, but when I add |+y> and |-y>, considering the correct expressions:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nAdding them gives [ |+z> + i |-z> + |+z> - i |-z> ] / sqrt(2) = (2 |+z>)/sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) |+z>.\n\nWait, that can't be right because |+y> and |-y> are orthogonal, so their sum should not be larger than sqrt(2) times |+z>.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Suppose |+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2), but that's not correct because then S_y would have real eigenstates, but the actual eigenstates involve complex phases. Alternatively, perhaps |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nThen, adding |+y> and |-y> gives (|+z> + i |-z> + |+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2) = (2 |+z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) |+z>.\n\nHmm, but that suggests that |+z> is (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2) because |+y> + |-y> = sqrt(2) |+z>.\n\nSo, if the initial state is |+z>, it can be written as (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, under the new Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y, the time evolution of each energy eigenstate is just a phase factor. So the state |+y> has energy E+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2) because S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y> = E+ |+y>.\n\nSimilarly, |-y> has E- = + gamma B (\u0127/2), because S_y |-y> = (-\u0127/2) |-y>, so H |-y> = -gamma B (-\u0127/2) |-y> = (gamma B \u0127/2) |-y>.\n\nSo the time evolution of each component is:\n\n|+y> \u2192 exp( -i E+ t / \u0127 ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y>\n\nSimilarly, |-y> \u2192 exp( -i E- t / \u0127 ) |-y> = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y>.\n\nSo the total state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, we need to find the expectation value of Sz, which is gamma times the expectation value of S_z. So <Sz> = gamma <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nBut let's compute <S_z>.\n\nExpress |psi(t)> in terms of |+z> and |-z> to compute <S_z>. Alternatively, perhaps express S_z in the basis of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z> and then compute the expectation value.\n\nWait, |psi(t)> is [ exp(i phi) |+y> + exp(-i phi) |-y> ] / sqrt(2), where phi = gamma B t/2.\n\nBut let's express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nAs per earlier, |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\nSimilarly, |-y> = (|+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo substituting into |psi(t)>:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ exp(i phi) (|+z> + i |-z> ) + exp(-i phi) (|+z> - i |-z> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) )\n\nWait, denominator is sqrt(2) from the initial expansion, multiplied by sqrt(2) from each |+y> and |-y>, so overall denominator is 2.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ exp(i phi) (|+z> + i |-z> ) + exp(-i phi) (|+z> - i |-z> ) ] / 2\n\nFactor out |+z> and |-z>:\n\n= [ (exp(i phi) + exp(-i phi)) |+z> + (i exp(i phi) - i exp(-i phi)) |-z> ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula:\n\nexp(i phi) + exp(-i phi) = 2 cos(phi)\ni exp(i phi) - i exp(-i phi) = i [ (cos phi + i sin phi) - (cos phi - i sin phi) ) ] = i [ 2 i sin phi ] = -2 sin phi\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 2 cos(phi) |+z> - 2 sin(phi) |-z> ] / 2\n\n= [ cos(phi) |+z> - sin(phi) |-z> ]\n\nSo the state |psi(t)> is cos(phi) |+z> - sin(phi) |-z>.\n\nNow, let's compute <Sz>, which is the expectation value of S_z.\n\nS_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>\nS_z |-z> = -(\u0127/2) |-z>\n\nSo,\n\n<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = [ cos(phi)* < +z | - sin(phi) < -z | ] [ cos(phi) |+z> - sin(phi) |-z> ] multiplied by (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, perhaps more carefully:\n\n<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = [ cos(phi) < +z | - sin(phi) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(phi) |+z> - sin(phi) |-z> ]\n\nSo,\n\n= cos(phi)^2 < +z | S_z | +z > - cos(phi) sin(phi) < +z | S_z | -z > \n- sin(phi) cos(phi) < -z | S_z | +z > + sin(phi)^2 < -z | S_z | -z >\n\nBut S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, and < +z | S_z | -z > = 0 because they are orthogonal.\n\nSo,\n\n= cos\u00b2(phi) (\u0127/2) + sin\u00b2(phi) (-\u0127/2)\n\n= (\u0127/2) ( cos\u00b2(phi) - sin\u00b2(phi) )\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2 phi)\n\nBecause cos(2 phi) = cos\u00b2(phi) - sin\u00b2(phi).\n\nSo <Sz> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(2 phi )\n\nBut phi is gamma B t / 2, so 2 phi is gamma B t.\n\nSo <Sz> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but wait a second. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, so <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>. So,\n\n<mu_z> = gamma * (gamma \u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, <Sz> is in units of \u0127/2, because spin-1/2. So <Sz> = (gamma \u0127/2) cos( ... )\n\nWait, let me clarify. The operator S_z has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So <Sz> in our case is (\u0127/2) cos(2 phi ). So,\n\n<mu_z> = gamma * <Sz> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(2 phi )\n\nBut phi is gamma B t/2. So 2 phi = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n<mu_z> = (gamma \u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the units might not make sense. Let me check the Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, the Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2 ), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2 )\n\nSo when we compute the time evolution, the phase factor is exp( -i E t / \u0127 )\n\nWhich for E_+ is exp( i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSo phi = gamma B t/2.\n\nWait, in our calculation, we have <Sz> proportional to cos(2 phi ), which is cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, which is gamma B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because the oscillation is cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, I thought sometimes spin precession introduces a factor. Oh, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The state |psi(t)> is cos(phi) |+z> - sin(phi) |-z>, with phi = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo when you compute <Sz>, it's (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(phi) - sin^2(phi) ] = (\u0127/2) cos(2 phi )\n\nSo the oscillation is at 2 phi, which is 2*(gamma B t/2) )= gamma B t.\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the average <mu_z> oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but why is the frequency not divided by something? Because when you have a spin-1/2 in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is often given by gamma B. Hmm, I'm a bit confused because sometimes in spin resonance, the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B.\n\nYes, exactly. The Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B, which is the frequency at which the spin precesses around the magnetic field. So in this case, the oscillation is at gamma B, so option B is correct.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. When the field is suddenly switched off and turned on along the $+Y$ direction, the particle's spin state evolves under the new Hamiltonian $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in an eigenstate of $S_z$, either $|+z\\rangle$ or $|-z\\rangle$. For simplicity, assume it is in $|+z\\rangle$.\n\n2. **New Hamiltonian**: The new Hamiltonian is $H = -\\gamma B S_y$.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nSo the setup is: there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma times Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, the magnetic moment mu is mu = gamma * Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin in the z-direction. So the magnetic moment is proportional to spin. Got it.\n\nInitially, the field is along +Z, so the particle's spin will align with it. The energy levels for spin-1/2 in a magnetic field B along Z are given by E = -mu\u00b7B. So since mu is gamma Sz, then E = -gamma Sz B. But for spin-1/2, Sz can be \u00b1 \u0127/2. Wait, actually, in terms of units, maybe I should think in terms of eigenvalues. Spin matrices have eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 for Sz, so the energies would be E = -gamma * (\u0127/2) * B for spin-up and similarly for spin-down.\n\nBut then the field is switched off and turned on along Y. So now the magnetic field is B in the Y direction. The magnetic moment will now precess around Y? Or maybe the spin state will evolve under the new Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, when the field changes, the Hamiltonian changes. The initial state was an eigenstate of the old Hamiltonian (along Z). When the Hamiltonian changes, the state doesn't change instantaneously, but the time evolution will be governed by the new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe new Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B', where B' is along Y. So mu is gamma Sz, and B' is in Y. So H = -gamma B (Sz * Y direction?), wait, no. Wait, the dot product is in the Y direction. So H = -gamma B (S_y), because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, and the field is along Y, so the interaction is mu \u00b7 B = gamma S \u00b7 B. Since B is along Y, S \u00b7 B is S_y * B.\n\nWait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the Hamiltonian H is -mu \u00b7 B. So H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, let me think. The magnetic dipole energy is H = -mu \u00b7 B. Since mu = gamma S, then H = -gamma (S \u00b7 B). When B is along Y, S \u00b7 B is S_y * B. So H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nBut wait, S_y is an operator. The initial state was an eigenstate of Sz, say |+z> or |-z>. So when the field is along Y, the system's state is no longer an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time.\n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z = gamma <Sz>. So we need to find how <Sz> oscillates over time.\n\nTo find the oscillation frequency, I think we can model the time evolution of the expectation value. The general approach for such problems is to find the time dependence of <Sz> under the new Hamiltonian H.\n\nSo the initial state is |psi(0)> = |+z> or |-z>, I suppose. Let's say it's |+z> for simplicity. But wait, when the field was along Z, the particle's spin is aligned. So initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, either up or down.\n\nAfter the field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. So the time evolution is given by the exponential of -i H t / \u0127.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The new H is proportional to S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y> states.\n\nWait, the eigenstates of S_y are (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) and (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2), right? Or maybe I have the signs mixed up. Let me recall: S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2)|+y>, and similarly for |-y>.\n\nSo |+y> is (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2), if I remember correctly. Or wait, maybe it's without the i? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about the matrix representation.\n\nThe spin matrices: Sx, Sy, Sz. The eigenstates of Sy are the same as Sx but rotated by 90 degrees. So for S_y, the eigenstates are |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) multiplied by some phase factors. Wait, actually, when you have S_y, the eigenstates are (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2) and (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2), because the ladder operators have i's involved. So I think that's right.\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nWait, let me express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:\n\n|+z> = [ |+y> + |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nIs that correct? Wait, let me think again. The eigenstates of Sy are:\n\n|+y> = (|0> + |1>) / sqrt(2) for spin-up, but perhaps with some phase factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2). So if I add |+y> and |-y>, I get (|+z> + i |-z> + |+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2) = (2 |+z> )/ sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) |+z>.\n\nWait, that would imply |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2). Wait, but when I add |+y> and |-y>, considering the correct expressions:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nAdding them gives [ |+z> + i |-z> + |+z> - i |-z> ] / sqrt(2) = (2 |+z>)/sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) |+z>.\n\nWait, that can't be right because |+y> and |-y> are orthogonal, so their sum should not be larger than sqrt(2) times |+z>.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Suppose |+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2), but that's not correct because then S_y would have real eigenstates, but the actual eigenstates involve complex phases. Alternatively, perhaps |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nThen, adding |+y> and |-y> gives (|+z> + i |-z> + |+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2) = (2 |+z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) |+z>.\n\nHmm, but that suggests that |+z> is (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2) because |+y> + |-y> = sqrt(2) |+z>.\n\nSo, if the initial state is |+z>, it can be written as (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, under the new Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y, the time evolution of each energy eigenstate is just a phase factor. So the state |+y> has energy E+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2) because S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y> = E+ |+y>.\n\nSimilarly, |-y> has E- = + gamma B (\u0127/2), because S_y |-y> = (-\u0127/2) |-y>, so H |-y> = -gamma B (-\u0127/2) |-y> = (gamma B \u0127/2) |-y>.\n\nSo the time evolution of each component is:\n\n|+y> \u2192 exp( -i E+ t / \u0127 ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y>\n\nSimilarly, |-y> \u2192 exp( -i E- t / \u0127 ) |-y> = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y>.\n\nSo the total state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, we need to find the expectation value of Sz, which is gamma times the expectation value of S_z. So <Sz> = gamma <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nBut let's compute <S_z>.\n\nExpress |psi(t)> in terms of |+z> and |-z> to compute <S_z>. Alternatively, perhaps express S_z in the basis of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z> and then compute the expectation value.\n\nWait, |psi(t)> is [ exp(i phi) |+y> + exp(-i phi) |-y> ] / sqrt(2), where phi = gamma B t/2.\n\nBut let's express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nAs per earlier, |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\nSimilarly, |-y> = (|+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo substituting into |psi(t)>:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ exp(i phi) (|+z> + i |-z> ) + exp(-i phi) (|+z> - i |-z> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) )\n\nWait, denominator is sqrt(2) from the initial expansion, multiplied by sqrt(2) from each |+y> and |-y>, so overall denominator is 2.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ exp(i phi) (|+z> + i |-z> ) + exp(-i phi) (|+z> - i |-z> ) ] / 2\n\nFactor out |+z> and |-z>:\n\n= [ (exp(i phi) + exp(-i phi)) |+z> + (i exp(i phi) - i exp(-i phi)) |-z> ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula:\n\nexp(i phi) + exp(-i phi) = 2 cos(phi)\ni exp(i phi) - i exp(-i phi) = i [ (cos phi + i sin phi) - (cos phi - i sin phi) ) ] = i [ 2 i sin phi ] = -2 sin phi\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 2 cos(phi) |+z> - 2 sin(phi) |-z> ] / 2\n\n= [ cos(phi) |+z> - sin(phi) |-z> ]\n\nSo the state |psi(t)> is cos(phi) |+z> - sin(phi) |-z>.\n\nNow, let's compute <Sz>, which is the expectation value of S_z.\n\nS_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>\nS_z |-z> = -(\u0127/2) |-z>\n\nSo,\n\n<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = [ cos(phi)* < +z | - sin(phi) < -z | ] [ cos(phi) |+z> - sin(phi) |-z> ] multiplied by (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, perhaps more carefully:\n\n<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = [ cos(phi) < +z | - sin(phi) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(phi) |+z> - sin(phi) |-z> ]\n\nSo,\n\n= cos(phi)^2 < +z | S_z | +z > - cos(phi) sin(phi) < +z | S_z | -z > \n- sin(phi) cos(phi) < -z | S_z | +z > + sin(phi)^2 < -z | S_z | -z >\n\nBut S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, and < +z | S_z | -z > = 0 because they are orthogonal.\n\nSo,\n\n= cos\u00b2(phi) (\u0127/2) + sin\u00b2(phi) (-\u0127/2)\n\n= (\u0127/2) ( cos\u00b2(phi) - sin\u00b2(phi) )\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2 phi)\n\nBecause cos(2 phi) = cos\u00b2(phi) - sin\u00b2(phi).\n\nSo <Sz> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(2 phi )\n\nBut phi is gamma B t / 2, so 2 phi is gamma B t.\n\nSo <Sz> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but wait a second. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, so <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>. So,\n\n<mu_z> = gamma * (gamma \u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, <Sz> is in units of \u0127/2, because spin-1/2. So <Sz> = (gamma \u0127/2) cos( ... )\n\nWait, let me clarify. The operator S_z has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So <Sz> in our case is (\u0127/2) cos(2 phi ). So,\n\n<mu_z> = gamma * <Sz> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(2 phi )\n\nBut phi is gamma B t/2. So 2 phi = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n<mu_z> = (gamma \u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the units might not make sense. Let me check the Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, the Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2 ), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2 )\n\nSo when we compute the time evolution, the phase factor is exp( -i E t / \u0127 )\n\nWhich for E_+ is exp( i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSo phi = gamma B t/2.\n\nWait, in our calculation, we have <Sz> proportional to cos(2 phi ), which is cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, which is gamma B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because the oscillation is cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, I thought sometimes spin precession introduces a factor. Oh, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The state |psi(t)> is cos(phi) |+z> - sin(phi) |-z>, with phi = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo when you compute <Sz>, it's (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(phi) - sin^2(phi) ] = (\u0127/2) cos(2 phi )\n\nSo the oscillation is at 2 phi, which is 2*(gamma B t/2) )= gamma B t.\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the average <mu_z> oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but why is the frequency not divided by something? Because when you have a spin-1/2 in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is often given by gamma B. Hmm, I'm a bit confused because sometimes in spin resonance, the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B.\n\nYes, exactly. The Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B, which is the frequency at which the spin precesses around the magnetic field. So in this case, the oscillation is at gamma B, so option B is correct.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. When the field is suddenly switched off and turned on along the $+Y$ direction, the particle's spin state evolves under the new Hamiltonian $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in an eigenstate of $S_z$, either $|+z\\rangle$ or $|-z\\rangle$. For simplicity, assume it is in $|+z\\rangle$.\n\n2. **New Hamiltonian**: The new Hamiltonian is $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, which are superpositions of $|+z\\rangle$ and $|-z\\rangle$:\n   \\[\n   |+y\\rangle = \\frac{|+z\\rangle + i|-z\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\quad |-y\\rangle = \\frac{|+z\\rangle - i|-z\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$:\n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{|+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n   \\]\n   Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{e^{i\\gamma B t/2}|+y\\rangle + e^{-i\\gamma B t/2}|-y\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: The $z$-component of the spin operator, $S_z$, has eigenvalues $\\pm \\hbar/2$ for $|+z\\rangle$ and $|-z\\rangle$. Using the time-evolved state, the expectation value of $S_z$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n\n5. **Magnetic Moment**: The magnetic moment $\\mu_z$ is proportional to $S_z$, so:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n\n6. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ arises from the $\\cos(\\gamma B t)$ term, indicating that the oscillation frequency is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$. This matches option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment in changing magnetic fields. Hmm, let's try to break it down.\n\nSo, the setup is that there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma times Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, I'm a bit rusty on spin systems. Let me think. The magnetic moment mu is proportional to the spin operator S, right? So mu = gamma * S, but wait, the question says mu equals gamma times Sz. Oh, so mu is only in the z-direction? Or is it that the magnetic moment is in the direction of the field? Hmm, maybe that's not the right way to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps mu is proportional to the component of S along the magnetic field direction. Oh wait, in the presence of a magnetic field, the magnetic moment tends to align with the field. But when the field changes direction, the system will precess.\n\nSo initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle's spin is aligned, so the energy is minimized. Then the field is switched to +Y. So now the magnetic field is along Y. How does this affect the spin?\n\nI remember that when the magnetic field changes, the spin will precess around the new field direction. The oscillation frequency is related to the energy splitting between the spin states in the new field.\n\nWait, but the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment. So we're looking at <mu_z> oscillating over time. Hmm.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, when a system is subjected to a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B. Wait, no, more accurately, the Hamiltonian for the interaction is H = -gamma * S \u00b7 B. Because mu is gamma S, so H = -mu \u00b7 B = -gamma (S \u00b7 B).\n\nWait, but in this problem, mu is given as gamma Sz. So maybe that's a simplification. Let me think. If the magnetic field is along Z, then mu_z = gamma S_z, so the Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B = -gamma S_z B. That would give energy levels proportional to S_z.\n\nBut when the field is along Y, then the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma (S_x B + S_y B + S_z B)? No, wait, because if B is along Y, then it's B in the y-direction, so H = -gamma S_y B. Wait, no, because mu is in the direction of the field. Wait, no, mu is a vector, and the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field via the dot product. So the energy is E = - mu \u00b7 B. But in this case, mu is given as gamma S_z. Oh wait, that's only the z-component of the magnetic moment. Or is mu the entire vector? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z. So that suggests that mu is the z-component of the magnetic moment. So perhaps the magnetic moment vector is (0,0,gamma S_z). But that can't be right because the magnetic moment should point in the same direction as the spin if the field is applied along that axis. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, maybe mu is proportional to the entire spin vector, but the question says mu equals gamma S_z. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps mu is the magnitude, but that doesn't make much sense because S_z is an operator. Oh wait, no. Maybe the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so a vector. Then, when the field is along Z, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_z. When the field is along Y, H becomes H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nBut the question states mu = gamma S_z, so perhaps mu is the z-component of the magnetic moment. So when the field is along Y, how does that affect the energy? Hmm, perhaps I need to model the situation correctly.\n\nWait, the initial state is with the magnetic field along Z, so the spin is aligned. The spin state is |+z>, since the magnetic moment is along Z.\n\nThen, the magnetic field is turned off and another is turned on along Y. So the Hamiltonian after the switch is H = -mu \u00b7 B, but since B is along Y now, and mu is gamma S_z, then H = - (gamma S_z) * B in the Y direction? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if B is along Y, then the magnetic moment's interaction would involve S_y. Hmm, perhaps the confusion is that mu is a vector, and when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. When the magnetic field is turned off, there's no Hamiltonian, so the state doesn't change. Then, the field is applied along Y. Now, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.\n\nSo the system's state will evolve under this new Hamiltonian. The time evolution will cause the state to precess in spin space, leading to oscillations in expectation values like <S_z>.\n\nThe energy levels for a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field along Y would be E = \u00b1 (gamma B / 2), because S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 for spin-1/2, but perhaps in units where \u0127 is set to 1, the energies are \u00b1 (gamma B/2).\n\nWait, let me think about the Hamiltonian. H = - gamma B S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2, but since we're dealing with spin-1/2, \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. But if we're using units where \u0127 is 1, then the energies are E = - gamma B (\u00b1 1/2) * \u0127? Wait, perhaps I should write H as H = - gamma B S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2, so the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = + gamma B (\u0127/2). Wait, that would make the energy splitting between the two states 2 * (gamma B \u0127/2) ) = gamma B \u0127. But the frequency of oscillation is related to the energy difference divided by \u0127. Because E = \u0127 omega.\n\nWait, but the time evolution is determined by the energy splitting. The transition frequency between the two states is (E_+ - E_-)/\u0127 = ( (-gamma B \u0127/2 ) - (gamma B \u0127/2 )) ) / \u0127 = (-gamma B \u0127 ) / \u0127 = -gamma B. The absolute value is gamma B, so the frequency is gamma B. But wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment.\n\nWait, the system starts in the |+z> state. The initial state after the field is applied along Y is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of S_y. So the state will evolve over time. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate.\n\nThe oscillation frequency comes from the energy difference between the states. So the energy splitting is 2*(gamma B/2) ) = gamma B. Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute the energy difference more carefully.\n\nH = - gamma B S_y. The eigenvalues are E_+ = (-gamma B) (\u0127/2), E_- = (+ gamma B) ( \u0127/2 ), because S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, and similarly for the other state.\n\nSo the energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (+gamma B \u0127/2) ) = - gamma B \u0127. The magnitude is gamma B \u0127. The frequency is this divided by \u0127, so omega = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial state is |+z>, which is a superposition of the eigenstates of S_y. So when the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y, the state will evolve with time. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate with a frequency determined by the energy splitting.\n\nThe time evolution is such that the probability amplitudes for the two states (|+y> and |-y>) will oscillate with time. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally. The frequency of this oscillation is (E_+ - E_- ) / \u0127 divided by 2pi, I think. Wait, no, the general formula for the oscillation frequency is (E_m - E_n ) / \u0127, where E_m and E_n are the energies of the states involved. Since the system starts in a state that's a combination of the two eigenstates, the expectation values will oscillate at the difference frequency.\n\nWait, the energy difference between the two states is 2 * (gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) ) = gamma B \u0127. So the oscillation frequency is (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 ) / (2 pi) ) ? No, wait. The energy difference is delta E = E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) ) = - gamma B \u0127. The absolute value is gamma B \u0127. The angular frequency is omega = delta E / \u0127 = gamma B \u0127 / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B. But wait, let me think about the units. gamma has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1), I think. Because magnetic moment is in units of J/T (since mu = gamma S, and S has units of J s). So gamma would have units (J s)/(J T s) ) = 1/(T). So gamma B would have units 1/s, which is correct for a frequency.\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B. Looking at the options, option B is gamma B. But wait, let me think again about the initial state.\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z>. After the field is turned to Y, the state is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of H. The time evolution will cause the state to precess. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate with a frequency equal to (E_+ - E_- ) / (2 pi \u0127) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing angular frequency with frequency. Wait, energy levels are E = hbar omega. So the energy difference is delta E = hbar (omega_+ - omega_-). So the frequency is (omega_+ - omega_-) ) = (E_+ - E_- ) / hbar.\n\nSo in this case, delta E is (-gamma B hbar/2 ) - (gamma B hbar/2 ) ) = - gamma B hbar. So the magnitude is gamma B hbar. So omega = delta E / hbar = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is omega = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. So the actual frequency (in Hz) is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B/(2 pi). Wait, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the number of cycles per second. So is the answer gamma B (angular frequency) or gamma B/(2 pi) (frequency in Hz)?\n\nWait, the question says, \"what is its oscillation frequency?\" and the options are given as gamma B, etc. Looking at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma B. Option A is gamma B / 2. So if the angular frequency is gamma B, then the frequency (in Hz) would be gamma B / (2 pi). But none of the options have a 2 pi factor. So perhaps the problem is referring to the angular frequency.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, when you talk about the Larmor frequency, it's the angular frequency. For example, the Larmor frequency is gamma B. So in that case, the angular frequency is gamma B, and the frequency in Hz is gamma B/(2 pi). But the question asks for the oscillation frequency. So which one is it?\n\nThe question says, the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. What's the oscillation frequency? So perhaps the answer is gamma B, which would correspond to the angular frequency. Alternatively, if the question is referring to the frequency in Hz, then it's gamma B/(2 pi), but that's not one of the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B, which is the angular frequency. So perhaps the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but wait another point. When the magnetic field is applied along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues are E = \u00b1 gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energy difference is E_+ - E_- = gamma B \u0127. So the angular frequency is (E_+ - E_-)/ \u0127 = gamma B. So that's the angular frequency, which is the answer.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n",

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing angular frequency with frequency. Wait, energy levels are E = hbar omega. So the energy difference is delta E = hbar (omega_+ - omega_-). So the frequency is (omega_+ - omega_-) ) = (E_+ - E_- ) / hbar.\n\nSo in this case, delta E is (-gamma B hbar/2 ) - (gamma B hbar/2 ) ) = - gamma B hbar. So the magnitude is gamma B hbar. So omega = delta E / hbar = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is omega = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. So the actual frequency (in Hz) is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B/(2 pi). Wait, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the number of cycles per second. So is the answer gamma B (angular frequency) or gamma B/(2 pi) (frequency in Hz)?\n\nWait, the question says, \"what is its oscillation frequency?\" and the options are given as gamma B, etc. Looking at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma B. Option A is gamma B / 2. So if the angular frequency is gamma B, then the frequency (in Hz) would be gamma B / (2 pi). But none of the options have a 2 pi factor. So perhaps the problem is referring to the angular frequency.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, when you talk about the Larmor frequency, it's the angular frequency. For example, the Larmor frequency is gamma B. So in that case, the angular frequency is gamma B, and the frequency in Hz is gamma B/(2 pi). But the question asks for the oscillation frequency. So which one is it?\n\nThe question says, the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. What's the oscillation frequency? So perhaps the answer is gamma B, which would correspond to the angular frequency. Alternatively, if the question is referring to the frequency in Hz, then it's gamma B/(2 pi), but that's not one of the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B, which is the angular frequency. So perhaps the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but wait another point. When the magnetic field is applied along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues are E = \u00b1 gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energy difference is E_+ - E_- = gamma B \u0127. So the angular frequency is (E_+ - E_-)/ \u0127 = gamma B. So that's the angular frequency, which is the answer.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. When the field is suddenly switched off and reactivated along the $+y$ direction, the particle's spin precesses, causing the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment to oscillate. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle is in the $|+z\\rangle$ state, an eigenstate of $S_z$. When the magnetic field is applied along $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\\pm \\hbar/2$. The corresponding energy eigenvalues are $E_+ = -\\gamma B \\hbar / 2$ and $E_- = +\\gamma B \\hbar / 2$. The energy splitting between the two states is $\\Delta E = |E_+ - E_-| = \\gamma B \\hbar$.\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the expectation value of $S_z$ is determined by the energy splitting. The angular frequency $\\omega$ is given by $\\omega = \\Delta E / \\hbar = \\gamma B$. Since the problem refers to the \"oscillation frequency,\" it is interpreted as the angular frequency, which matches option B.\n\nCritical analysis of the options:\n- **Option A ($\\gamma B / 2$):** Incorrect, as this does not match the energy splitting or angular frequency derived from the Hamiltonian.\n- **Option B ($\\gamma B$):** Correct, as it matches the angular frequency derived from the energy splitting.\n- **Option C ($\\sqrt{2} \\gamma B$):** Incorrect, as this value does not correspond to any physical quantity in the problem.\n- **Option D ($\\gamma B / \\sqrt{2}$):** Incorrect, as this value is not supported by the energy splitting calculation.\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency is $\\gamma B$, corresponding to option B.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about a spin-1/2 particle and how its magnetic moment oscillates when the magnetic field changes direction.\n\nAlright, the setup: there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so when the magnetic field changes, the system's Hamiltonian must change too. Because the particle's energy depends on the magnetic field direction. So initially, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu\u00b7B. Since mu is gamma Sz, and B is along Z, H_initial = -gamma B Sz.\n\nBut when the magnetic field is turned off and then on along Y, the new Hamiltonian H_final would be -gamma B Sy, because the magnetic moment interacts with the field direction. Oh wait, but wait: when the field is turned off, does the spin state change? Or does it stay the same? Because the spin state is determined by the initial Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz. Because the magnetic field is along Z. So its spin state is either up or down in the z-direction. Let's say, for simplicity, that the particle is in the eigenstate |+z> before the field is turned off.\n\nThen, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off. But then, another field is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. But wait, the spin state after the field change\u2014what is it? Because when the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian becomes zero, right? So the state doesn't change instantaneously. So the state remains |+z> (or whatever it was) when the field is turned off.\n\nBut then the new field is applied along Y. So the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B Sy. Oh wait, but the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the interaction energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So when B is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, wait, no: mu is a vector, so mu \u00b7 B is gamma S \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, then mu \u00b7 B = gamma (S_x Bx + S_y By + S_z Bz). Since B is along Y, By = B, others zero. So H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nBut wait, the spin matrices: in quantum mechanics, the spin components are represented by S_x, S_y, S_z. For a spin-1/2 particle, S_x = (\u0127/2) sigma_x, and similarly for others. But the units here might not matter because the problem is about the frequency.\n\nSo, the system's initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. Then, when the new Hamiltonian is applied, the state will evolve under H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, but S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction, so the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. But since the Hamiltonian is time-independent after the change, we can find the energy eigenstates and see how the state evolves.\n\nThe initial state is |+z>. Let's write that in terms of the eigenstates of H. Because H is proportional to S_y, its eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, which are the eigenstates of S_y.\n\nWait, |+y> is the eigenstate of S_y with positive eigenvalue, and |-y> with negative. So, the initial state |+z> can be expressed as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nHmm, I think I remember that the eigenstates of S_y are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>. Let me recall: the |+y> state is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). Or maybe the other way around with a phase factor, but that doesn't matter much for the energy differences.\n\nSo, the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Because when you expand |+z> in the basis of |+y> and |-y>, the coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) each. Let me check: |+z> = (|+y> + e^{i pi/2} |-y>)/sqrt(2)? Wait, maybe the phase depends on the definition. Alternatively, perhaps |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) + some phase factors. But maybe for the purposes of energy, the phase doesn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute the eigenvalues. Let's think about the energy levels.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. Wait, but for spin-1/2, S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, and similarly for |-y>.\n\nWait, but gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and mu = gamma S. So, the Hamiltonian would have energy levels E = -mu \u00b7 B. Since B is along Y, E = -gamma B (S_y).\n\nWait, but S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the energies are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). Wait, no: because H is -gamma B S_y, so S_y is multiplied by -gamma B. So when S_y is \u0127/2, H gives E = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (+1) = -gamma B \u0127/2. Similarly for the other eigenstate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the signs. Let's write H = -gamma B S_y. So, when S_y is \u0127/2, H gives E = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (+1) = -gamma B \u0127/2. The other state gives E = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (-1) = gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nSo the energy levels are E_+ = gamma B \u0127/2, and E_- = -gamma B \u0127/2. Wait, no, wait: H = -gamma B S_y. So, for eigenstates of S_y, which are |+y> and |-y>, the corresponding energies are:\n\nE_+y = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (+1) = -gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nE_-y = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (-1) = gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the energies are E_+y = -gamma B \u0127/2, and E_-y = gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nSo the initial state is |+z> which is a superposition of |+y> and |-y> with equal coefficients (ignoring phase for now). Let's say it's (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). So the state can be written as a combination of the two eigenstates.\n\nSo the time evolution of each component will pick up a phase factor based on their energy. So the state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = (e^{-i E_+y t / \u0127} |+y> + e^{-i E_-y t / \u0127} |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nPlugging in the E's:\n\nE_+y = -gamma B \u0127/2 \u2192 exponent becomes e^{-i (-gamma B \u0127/2) t / \u0127} = e^{i gamma B t/2}.\n\nE_-y = gamma B \u0127/2 \u2192 exponent becomes e^{-i (gamma B \u0127/2) t / \u0127} = e^{-i gamma B t/2}.\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = [ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |+y> + e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we need to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z. Since mu = gamma S, mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo, <mu_z> = gamma <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nSo let's compute this expectation value.\n\nFirst, express S_z in terms of the basis. S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2)|+z>, S_z |-z> = (-\u0127/2)|-z>.\n\nBut in our case, the state |psi(t)> is a combination of |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute <S_z> directly.\n\nLet me write |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo, substituting into |psi(t)>:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nLet me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from both terms:\n\n= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) )\n\nWhich is [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>) ] / 2\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |-z> ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula, e^{i\u03b8} + e^{-i\u03b8} = 2 cos\u03b8, and e^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8} = 2i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + 2i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z> ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z>\n\nSo, the state |psi(t)> is cos(\u03b8)|+z> + i sin(\u03b8)|-z>, where \u03b8 = gamma B t/2.\n\nNow, compute <S_z>.\n\nS_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, S_z |-z> = (-\u0127/2) |-z>.\n\nSo, <S_z> = [ cos\u03b8 < +z | + i sin\u03b8 < -z | ] S_z [ cos\u03b8 |+z> + i sin\u03b8 |-z> ]\n\nLet me compute this inner product.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n= cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 < +z | S_z | +z > + cos\u03b8 * i sin\u03b8 < +z | S_z | -z > \n+ i sin\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 < -z | S_z | +z > + i sin\u03b8 * i sin\u03b8 < -z | S_z | -z > \n\nCompute each term:\n\n1. cos\u00b2\u03b8 * (\u0127/2) < +z | +z > = cos\u00b2\u03b8 (\u0127/2) * 1\n2. cos\u03b8 i sin\u03b8 * (\u0127/2) < +z | -z > = cos\u03b8 i sin\u03b8 (\u0127/2) * 0 (since < +z | -z >=0)\n3. i sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 * (\u0127/2) < -z | +z > = i sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 (\u0127/2) *0\n4. (i^2) sin\u00b2\u03b8 * (-\u0127/2) < -z | -z > = (-1) sin\u00b2\u03b8 (\u0127/2) *1\n\nSo, only terms 1 and 4 contribute.\n\nThus,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 ]\n\nBecause:\n\nterm1: cos\u00b2\u03b8 * (\u0127/2)\nterm4: (-1) sin\u00b2\u03b8 * (\u0127/2) \u2192 so term4 is (\u0127/2)(-sin\u00b2\u03b8)\nSo overall, (\u0127/2)(cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8) )\n\nBut cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos(2\u03b8), so:\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8 )\n\nBut theta is gamma B t/2, so 2\u03b8 = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nBut the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma * < S_z > = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, what's the average of mu_z oscillating with frequency omega. The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t in the cosine argument divided by (2 pi), but in the problem, the question is about the oscillation frequency. So the cosine is cos(omega t), so omega = gamma B.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again. The expression is cos(gamma B t ), so the angular frequency is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency f is gamma B / (2 pi). But the question is asking for the oscillation frequency, which I think refers to the angular frequency (omega) or the frequency in terms of how many cycles per second. But looking at the options, option B is gamma B, which would be the angular frequency.\n\nWait, but wait: let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, in the calculation, we have <mu_z> = (gamma \u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, gamma has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1) perhaps, because mu = gamma S. And S has units of \u0127/2, so mu would have units of gamma * (\u0127/2). So the units of gamma would be (mu * 2)/(\u0127), but perhaps that's getting too detailed.\n\nWait, but the key point is the oscillation frequency in the expression. The oscillation is at frequency omega = gamma B, since cos(omega t) where omega = gamma B.\n\nSo the average of mu_z oscillates with frequency omega = gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. Because when the magnetic field is applied in the Y direction, the energy levels are determined by S_y. The transition between the states would cause oscillations in expectation values. But in this case, the state is a superposition of the eigenstates of S_y, so the expectation value oscillates.\n\nWait, but in the expression for <mu_z>, we have a cos(gamma B t) term, implying that the frequency is gamma B. So the answer should be B) gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: the time evolution is governed by the energy difference between the states. The energy levels are E_+y = gamma B \u0127/2 and E_-y = -gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nThe difference between the energies is Delta E = E_+y - E_-y = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe time period is related to the energy difference by Delta E = \u0127 omega, so omega = (Delta E) / \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which matches option B.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B) gamma*B.\n",

So when S_y is \u0127/2, H gives E = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (+1) = -gamma B \u0127/2. Similarly for the other eigenstate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the signs. Let's write H = -gamma B S_y. So, when S_y is \u0127/2, H gives E = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (+1) = -gamma B \u0127/2. The other state gives E = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (-1) = gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nSo the energy levels are E_+ = gamma B \u0127/2, and E_- = -gamma B \u0127/2. Wait, no, wait: H = -gamma B S_y. So, for eigenstates of S_y, which are |+y> and |-y>, the corresponding energies are:\n\nE_+y = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (+1) = -gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nE_-y = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (-1) = gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the energies are E_+y = -gamma B \u0127/2, and E_-y = gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nSo the initial state is |+z> which is a superposition of |+y> and |-y> with equal coefficients (ignoring phase for now). Let's say it's (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). So the state can be written as a combination of the two eigenstates.\n\nSo the time evolution of each component will pick up a phase factor based on their energy. So the state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = (e^{-i E_+y t / \u0127} |+y> + e^{-i E_-y t / \u0127} |-y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nPlugging in the E's:\n\nE_+y = -gamma B \u0127/2 \u2192 exponent becomes e^{-i (-gamma B \u0127/2) t / \u0127} = e^{i gamma B t/2}.\n\nE_-y = gamma B \u0127/2 \u2192 exponent becomes e^{-i (gamma B \u0127/2) t / \u0127} = e^{-i gamma B t/2}.\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = [ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |+y> + e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we need to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z. Since mu = gamma S, mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo, <mu_z> = gamma <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nSo let's compute this expectation value.\n\nFirst, express S_z in terms of the basis. S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2)|+z>, S_z |-z> = (-\u0127/2)|-z>.\n\nBut in our case, the state |psi(t)> is a combination of |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute <S_z> directly.\n\nLet me write |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo, substituting into |psi(t)>:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nLet me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from both terms:\n\n= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) )\n\nWhich is [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>) ] / 2\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |-z> ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula, e^{i\u03b8} + e^{-i\u03b8} = 2 cos\u03b8, and e^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8} = 2i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + 2i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z> ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z>\n\nSo, the state |psi(t)> is cos(\u03b8)|+z> + i sin(\u03b8)|-z>, where \u03b8 = gamma B t/2.\n\nNow, compute <S_z>.\n\nS_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, S_z |-z> = (-\u0127/2) |-z>.\n\nSo, <S_z> = [ cos\u03b8 < +z | + i sin\u03b8 < -z | ] S_z [ cos\u03b8 |+z> + i sin\u03b8 |-z> ]\n\nLet me compute this inner product.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n= cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 < +z | S_z | +z > + cos\u03b8 * i sin\u03b8 < +z | S_z | -z > \n+ i sin\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 < -z | S_z | +z > + i sin\u03b8 * i sin\u03b8 < -z | S_z | -z > \n\nCompute each term:\n\n1. cos\u00b2\u03b8 * (\u0127/2) < +z | +z > = cos\u00b2\u03b8 (\u0127/2) * 1\n2. cos\u03b8 i sin\u03b8 * (\u0127/2) < +z | -z > = cos\u03b8 i sin\u03b8 (\u0127/2) * 0 (since < +z | -z >=0)\n3. i sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 * (\u0127/2) < -z | +z > = i sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 (\u0127/2) *0\n4. (i^2) sin\u00b2\u03b8 * (-\u0127/2) < -z | -z > = (-1) sin\u00b2\u03b8 (\u0127/2) *1\n\nSo, only terms 1 and 4 contribute.\n\nThus,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 ]\n\nBecause:\n\nterm1: cos\u00b2\u03b8 * (\u0127/2)\nterm4: (-1) sin\u00b2\u03b8 * (\u0127/2) \u2192 so term4 is (\u0127/2)(-sin\u00b2\u03b8)\nSo overall, (\u0127/2)(cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8) )\n\nBut cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos(2\u03b8), so:\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8 )\n\nBut theta is gamma B t/2, so 2\u03b8 = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nBut the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma * < S_z > = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, what's the average of mu_z oscillating with frequency omega. The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t in the cosine argument divided by (2 pi), but in the problem, the question is about the oscillation frequency. So the cosine is cos(omega t), so omega = gamma B.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again. The expression is cos(gamma B t ), so the angular frequency is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency f is gamma B / (2 pi). But the question is asking for the oscillation frequency, which I think refers to the angular frequency (omega) or the frequency in terms of how many cycles per second. But looking at the options, option B is gamma B, which would be the angular frequency.\n\nWait, but wait: let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, in the calculation, we have <mu_z> = (gamma \u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, gamma has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1) perhaps, because mu = gamma S. And S has units of \u0127/2, so mu would have units of gamma * (\u0127/2). So the units of gamma would be (mu * 2)/(\u0127), but perhaps that's getting too detailed.\n\nWait, but the key point is the oscillation frequency in the expression. The oscillation is at frequency omega = gamma B, since cos(omega t) where omega = gamma B.\n\nSo the average of mu_z oscillates with frequency omega = gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. Because when the magnetic field is applied in the Y direction, the energy levels are determined by S_y. The transition between the states would cause oscillations in expectation values. But in this case, the state is a superposition of the eigenstates of S_y, so the expectation value oscillates.\n\nWait, but in the expression for <mu_z>, we have a cos(gamma B t) term, implying that the frequency is gamma B. So the answer should be B) gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: the time evolution is governed by the energy difference between the states. The energy levels are E_+y = gamma B \u0127/2 and E_-y = -gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nThe difference between the energies is Delta E = E_+y - E_-y = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe time period is related to the energy difference by Delta E = \u0127 omega, so omega = (Delta E) / \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which matches option B.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B) gamma*B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then turned off and reactivated along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\\rangle$.\n\n2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the magnetic field is reactivated along $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes:\n   \\[\n   H = -\\gamma B S_y\n   \\]\n   The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\\pm \\hbar/2$. Thus, the energy eigenvalues are:\n   \\[\n   E_{+y} = -\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}, \\quad E_{-y} = \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ is expressed as a superposition of $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$:\n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{-iE_{+y}t/\\hbar} |+y\\rangle + e^{-iE_{-y}t/\\hbar} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   Substituting the energy eigenvalues:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{i\\gamma B t/2} |+y\\rangle + e^{-i\\gamma B t/2} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expectation Value of $\\mu_z$**: The $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ is computed as:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle.\n   \\]\n   Expanding $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$ in terms of $|+z\\rangle$ and $|-z\\rangle$, and using the fact that $S_z |+z\\rangle = \\hbar/2 |+z\\rangle$ and $S_z |-z\\rangle = -\\hbar/2 |-z\\rangle$, the result simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n\n5. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ is governed by the $\\cos(\\gamma B t)$ term. The angular frequency of oscillation is therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\omega = \\gamma B.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction, and then it's suddenly turned off and turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude. We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, I remember that the magnetic moment mu is related to the spin operator S. Oh right, mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. So, mu_z would be gamma * S_z. But the question says mu is equal to gamma*S_z. So, yeah, mu is proportional to S_z.\n\nInitially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's spin will align with this field. Since the spin is 1/2, the eigenvalues for S_z are \u00b1 \u0127/2. But wait, when the magnetic field is applied along Z, the energy levels are determined by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian is H = -mu\u00b7B. Oh wait, more accurately, H = - mu \u00b7 B. Since mu is gamma S_z, and B is along Z, H becomes H = -gamma B S_z. So the energies are E = -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2) * (1/2?), Wait, wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the spin matrices for S_z are in units of \u0127. So S_z can be \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the eigenvalues for H would be E = -mu_z B, because H = -mu\u00b7B. Oh wait, mu is gamma S_z, so H = - gamma S_z B. So E = - gamma B (\u0127/2) and + gamma B (\u0127/2) for the two spin states.\n\nBut wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So mu_z is gamma S_z. So H = - mu \u00b7 B = - mu_z B when B is along Z. So H = - gamma S_z B. So the energy levels are E = - gamma B (\u0127/2) and + gamma B (\u0127/2), right? Or wait, S_z has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E = - gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So E = \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2) * (-1), wait no. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, H = - mu \u00b7 B. So since mu = gamma S, then H = -gamma S \u00b7 B. If B is in the z-direction, then H = - gamma B S_z. So the energy eigenvalues are E = - gamma B (S_z eigenvalue). And S_z eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E = -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So the two possible energies are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (+1) = - (gamma B \u0127)/2, and E_- = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (-1) = (gamma B \u0127)/2.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check that. Because sometimes the energy is given as H = - mu \u00b7 B, and mu = gamma S, so H = -gamma S \u00b7 B. So if B is along +Z, then H = -gamma B S_z.\n\nSo, when the magnetic field is applied along Z, the spin will precess, but once it's in an eigenstate, it's stationary. So the initial state is either up or down in the Z direction.\n\nBut then the magnetic field is turned off (so B=0) and then turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H' = - mu \u00b7 B', where B' is along Y. So H' = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but wait, when the field is turned off, the particle is in a state, and then when the field changes direction, the state might not be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, the process is: initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of H_initial (along Z). Then the field is turned off (H=0 for a moment), but I think the state doesn't change because the Hamiltonian is zero, so the state remains the same. Then the field is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Because B is along Y.\n\nSo the state after the field change is the same as before, but now the Hamiltonian is different. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z, which might not be an eigenstate of H'.\n\nSo the time evolution under the new Hamiltonian will cause transitions between states, leading to oscillations in observables.\n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>, because mu = gamma S. So we need to find the time dependence of <S_z>.\n\nI remember that when a system is in a state that is a superposition of energy eigenstates, the expectation value of an observable can oscillate with frequencies related to the energy differences.\n\nSo, the initial state is |psi(0)> = |+z> or |-z>, the eigenstates of S_z. Let's suppose it's |+z> for simplicity.\n\nThe new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Let me compute the eigenstates of H. The eigenvalues are found by solving H|psi> = E |psi>.\n\nBut H = - gamma B S_y. The spin matrices for S_y are a bit different. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2, respectively.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of H will be E = - gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, wait. Because H = -gamma B S_y. So S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, so H|+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y> => E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2). Similarly, E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake here because I might have confused the sign somewhere.\n\nWait, S_y is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli Y matrix. So S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. Then H = - gamma B S_y would have eigenvalues E = -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2), which are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energy difference between the two states is (E_- - E_+) = gamma B (\u0127/2) - (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the energy levels are split by gamma B \u0127. But how does this relate to the oscillation frequency?\n\nThe time evolution of a state that's a superposition of two energy eigenstates leads to oscillations with frequencies proportional to the energy differences divided by Planck's constant (h-bar).\n\nWait, the general solution when a state is a superposition of two energy eigenstates |E1> and |E2> with coefficients c1 and c2 is |psi(t)> = c1 exp(-i E1 t / \u0127) |E1> + c2 exp(-i E2 t / \u0127) |E2>.\n\nIf the state is a superposition of |E1> and |E2>, then the expectation value of an observable can oscillate with a frequency (E2 - E1)/(2\u03c0 \u0127) * 2\u03c0, which is (E2 - E1)/\u0127.\n\nWait, the time dependence comes from the phase factors. When you take the expectation value of an observable, terms like exp(i (E1 - E2) t / \u0127) and their complex conjugates will appear. So the oscillation frequency is (E2 - E1)/(2\u0127) * 2, perhaps? Wait, let me think again.\n\nThe time dependence in the expectation value of an observable (like S_z) would involve terms like e^{i (E1 - E2) t / \u0127} and e^{-i (E1 - E2) t / \u0127}, which combine to give terms proportional to cos[(E1 - E2) t / \u0127]. So the oscillation frequency is (E1 - E2)/(2\u03c0 \u0127) * 2\u03c0, which simplifies to (E1 - E2)/\u0127. So the frequency is (E1 - E2)/ (2\u03c0 \u0127) ) * 2\u03c0, which is (E1 - E2)/ \u0127.\n\nWait, let me compute (E2 - E1)/ \u0127. E2 is gamma B \u0127/2, E1 is -gamma B \u0127/2. So E2 - E1 = gamma B \u0127/2 - (-gamma B \u0127/2) = gamma B \u0127. So (E2 - E1)/ \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the frequency would be gamma B.\n\nWait, but that's the energy difference divided by \u0127. So the oscillation frequency is (E2 - E1)/(2\u03c0 \u0127) ) * 2\u03c0, which is (gamma B \u0127) / (2\u03c0 \u0127) ) * 2\u03c0 = gamma B.\n\nWait, no, let's correct that. The general formula for the oscillation frequency is (E2 - E1)/(2\u03c0 \u0127). Because when you have two states with energies E1 and E2, the transition frequency is (E2 - E1)/(2\u03c0 \u0127). So the frequency is (E2 - E1)/(2\u03c0 \u0127).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The energy difference is delta E = E2 - E1. The angular frequency (omega) is delta E / \u0127. Because E = \u0127 omega. So omega = delta E / \u0127.\n\nIn this case, delta E is gamma B \u0127. So omega = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B. So the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency in terms of cycles per second (Hz) is omega/(2\u03c0) = gamma B/(2\u03c0). But wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency in terms of how the average <mu_z> oscillates, which would be at this frequency.\n\nWait, but let's get back to the problem. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. The new Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. So the eigenstates of H are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ and E_-.\n\nSo, to find how |psi(0)> evolves under H, we need to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe |+y> and |-y> states can be written in terms of |+z> and |-z> as:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the initial state |+z> can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nBecause substituting:\n\n( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2) = [ (|+z> + |-z> ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / (sqrt(2)*2) )\n\nWait, let me compute this properly.\n\nWait, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo adding them: |+y> + |-y> = [ (|+z> + |-z>) + (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / sqrt(2) \n= [ 2 |+z> ] / sqrt(2) \n= sqrt(2) |+z>\n\nSo |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the initial state |+z> is a superposition of |+y> and |-y> with coefficients 1/sqrt(2) each.\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) exp(-i E_+ t/\u0127) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) exp(-i E_- t/\u0127) |-y>\n\nE_+ is the energy of |+y>, which is -gamma B (\u0127/2)\nE_- is the energy of |-y>, which is gamma B (\u0127/2)\n\nSo plugging in E_+ and E_-:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B (\u0127/2) t / \u0127 ) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) exp( -i (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) t / \u0127 ) |-y>\n\nWait, let me compute the exponents.\n\nE_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2). So E_+ t / \u0127 = [ -gamma B (\u0127/2) * t ] / \u0127 = -gamma B t /2.\n\nSimilarly, E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So E_- t / \u0127 = [ gamma B (\u0127/2) * t ] / \u0127 = gamma B t /2.\n\nSo:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |-y>\n\nWait, because E_+ is negative, the exponent for |+y> is exp( -i E_+ t/\u0127 ) = exp( i gamma B t/2 ), and for |-y>, it's exp( -i E_- t/\u0127 ) = exp( -i (gamma B (\u0127/2)) t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i gamma B t/2 ). Wait, no:\n\nWait, E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2). So E_+ t / \u0127 = (- gamma B (\u0127/2) * t ) / \u0127 = - gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo exp(-i E_+ t/ \u0127) = exp( i gamma B t/2 )\n\nSimilarly, E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So E_- t / \u0127 = gamma B t/2.\n\nSo exp(-i E_- t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i gamma B t/2 )\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y>\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me re-express this correctly.\n\nThe coefficient for |+y> is exp( -i E_+ t/\u0127 ) = exp( i gamma B t/2 )\n\nThe coefficient for |-y> is exp( -i E_- t/\u0127 ) = exp( -i (gamma B (\u0127/2) ) t / \u0127 ) ) = exp( -i gamma B t/2 )\n\nSo |psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y>\n\nNow, to find <S_z> at time t, we can compute <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nBut S_z in the |+y> and |-y> basis can be represented as a matrix. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly.\n\nAlternatively, since S_z is (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], and |+y> and |-y> are given in terms of |+z> and |-z>, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value.\n\nBut maybe a smarter approach is to express S_z in terms of the |+y> and |-y> basis.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the expectation value of S_z.\n\n< S_z > = < psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) >\n\nExpressed in the |+y> and |-y> basis, we can write this as:\n\n< psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ]* < +y | S_z | +y > (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) \n+ [ (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ]* < +y | S_z | -y > (1/sqrt(2)) exp( -i gamma B t/2 )\n+ [ (1/sqrt(2)) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ]* < -y | S_z | +y > (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 )\n+ [ (1/sqrt(2)) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ]* < -y | S_z | -y > (1/sqrt(2)) exp( -i gamma B t/2 )\n\nBut wait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, since S_z is an observable, and the state is a superposition, perhaps we can compute it more directly.\n\nWait, S_z can be expressed in terms of the |+y> and |-y> basis. Let's find the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis.\n\nWe know that:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n|-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nWe can write S_z as a 2x2 matrix in the |+y>, |-y> basis. Since S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, and similar for |-z>.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the matrix elements.\n\nAlternatively, compute < S_z > using the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the time evolution of <S_z> directly.\n\nWait, another approach: the expectation value of S_z as a function of time. Since the state is a superposition of energy eigenstates, the expectation value oscillates.\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z>, which in the |+y>, |-y> basis is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i E_- t/\u0127} |-y>\n\nWe can plug in E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nSo E_+ t/\u0127 = (- gamma B (\u0127/2) ) * t / \u0127 = - gamma B t / 2\n\nSo e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} = e^{i gamma B t/2 }\n\nSimilarly, E_- t/\u0127 = (gamma B (\u0127/2)) t / \u0127 = gamma B t / 2\n\ne^{-i E_- t/\u0127} = e^{-i gamma B t/2 }\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y>\n\nNow, to find <S_z>, we can compute:\n\n<S_z> = < psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) >\n\nExpressed in the |+y> and |-y> basis.\n\nWe can write S_z as:\n\nS_z = (\u0127/2) [ |+z><+z| - |-z><-z| ]\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the matrix elements of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis.\n\nLet me compute the matrix elements:\n\n< +y | S_z | +y > = (\u0127/2) [ < +z | +y > ]^2 * (something?)\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to compute S_z in terms of the |+y> and |-y> states.\n\nSince S_z is (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], and the |+y> and |-y> states are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>, perhaps we can find the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis.\n\nWait, let me compute the matrix elements:\n\n< +y | S_z | +y > = (\u0127/2) [ < +y | +z > ]^2 - (\u0127/2) [ < +y | -z > ]^2 ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps a better way is to note that S_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) < +y | S_z | +y > ?\n\nWait, S_z |+y> is (\u0127/2) times the expectation value. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute S_z |+y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nWait, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\nSo S_z |+y> = (S_z |+z> + S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> - (\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) ( |+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) ( (|+y> - 2 |+y> ? ) Wait, no.\n\nWait, because |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2), and |-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2). So let's substitute these into S_z |+y>:\n\nS_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ (|+y> + |-y> )/(sqrt(2)) ) - (|+y> - |-y> )/(sqrt(2)) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ ( (|+y> + |-y> ) - (|+y> - |-y> )) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ (2 |-y> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ 2 |-y> / (2) ) ]\n= (\u0127/2) ( |-y> )\n\nSo S_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) |-y>\nSimilarly, S_z |-y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nSimilarly, S_z |-y> = (\u0127/2) (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should recompute S_z |-y>.\n\nWait, |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo S_z |-y> = (S_z |+z> - S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> - ( - \u0127/2 |+z> ) ) / sqrt(2)\n= [ (\u0127/2 |+z> + \u0127/2 |+z> ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= ( \u0127 |+z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) ( |+z> + |-z> ) ) / sqrt(2) ? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should find the matrix elements directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis is:\n\nS_z = (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] in the |+z>, |-z> basis. To find it in the |+y>, |-y> basis, we can perform a basis transformation.\n\nThe transformation matrix from |+z>, |-z> to |+y>, |-y> is:\n\nU = 1/sqrt(2) [ [1, 1], [1, -1] ]\n\nSo U^dagger is 1/sqrt(2) [ [1,1], [1,-1] ]^T = 1/sqrt(2) [ [1,1], [1,-1] ]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the columns of U are the |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nSo:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo the matrix U is:\n\nU = [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ],\n       [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2) ] ]\n\nSo, the matrix representing S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis is U^dagger * S_z (in |+z>, |-z> basis) * U.\n\nS_z in |+z>, |-z> is (\u0127/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSo, let's compute U^dagger * S_z * U.\n\nU^dagger is [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)] ]\n\nSo, compute U^dagger * S_z:\n\nU^dagger * S_z = [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)] ] * [ [\u0127/2, 0], [0, -\u0127/2] ]\n\n= [ [ (1/sqrt(2))(\u0127/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(0), (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (1/sqrt(2))(-\u0127/2) ),\n     [ (1/sqrt(2))(\u0127/2) + (-1/sqrt(2))(0), (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (-1/sqrt(2))(-\u0127/2) ) ] ]\n\nWait, actually, matrix multiplication:\n\nFirst row, first column:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (\u0127/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 = (\u0127/2)(1/sqrt(2)).\n\nFirst row, second column:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u0127/2) = (- \u0127/2)(1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSecond row, first column:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (\u0127/2) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 0 = (\u0127/2)(1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSecond row, second column:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u0127/2) = (\u0127/2)(1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo U^dagger * S_z is:\n\n[ [ \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)), - \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ],\n  [ \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)), \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ] ]\n\nNow multiply this by U:\n\nU is [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ],\n        [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2) ] ]\n\nSo, let's compute the product (U^dagger S_z) U.\n\nThe product will be a 2x2 matrix.\n\nFirst element (1,1):\n\nRow 1 of (U^dagger S_z) dot column 1 of U.\n\n( \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(1/\u221a2) ) + ( - \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(1/\u221a2) )\n\n= \u0127/(2\u221a2) * 1/\u221a2  - \u0127/(2\u221a2) * 1/\u221a2\n= [ \u0127/(2 * 2) ) ] - [ \u0127/(2 * 2) ) ]\n= 0.\n\nElement (1,2):\n\nRow 1 of (U^dagger S_z) dot column 2 of U.\n\n( \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(1/\u221a2) ) + ( - \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(-1/\u221a2) )\n\n= \u0127/(2*2) + \u0127/(2*2)\n= \u0127/4 + \u0127/4 = \u0127/2.\n\nElement (2,1):\n\nRow 2 of (U^dagger S_z) dot column 1 of U.\n\n( \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(1/\u221a2) ) + ( \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(1/\u221a2) )\n\n= \u0127/(4) + \u0127/(4) = \u0127/2.\n\nElement (2,2):\n\nRow 2 of (U^dagger S_z) dot column 2 of U.\n\n( \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(1/\u221a2) ) + ( \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(-1/\u221a2) )\n\n= \u0127/(4) - \u0127/(4) = 0.\n\nSo the resulting matrix is:\n\n[ [0, \u0127/2 ],\n  [\u0127/2, 0 ] ]\n\nWhich is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli X matrix.\n\nSo, S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis is (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the same as the original S_z in the |+z>, |-z> basis. That makes sense because S_z and S_y are related by a rotation, but their matrix representations in their respective bases are the same structure.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit circular. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed with the expectation value.\n\nSo, given that, the expectation value <S_z> is given by:\n\n< S_z > = < psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) >\n\nWhich, in the |+y>, |-y> basis, can be written as:\n\n= [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} ]^* [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} ] < +y | S_z | +y > \n+ [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} ]^* [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] < +y | S_z | -y > \n+ [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ]^* [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} ] < -y | S_z | +y > \n+ [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ]^* [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] < -y | S_z | -y > \n\nBut from earlier, we found that in the |+y>, |-y> basis, S_z has the matrix [[0, \u0127/2], [\u0127/2, 0]]. So:\n\n< +y | S_z | +y > = 0\n< +y | S_z | -y > = \u0127/2\n< -y | S_z | +y > = \u0127/2\n< -y | S_z | -y > = 0\n\nSo substituting these in:\n\n= (1/2) e^{-i gamma B t/2} e^{i gamma B t/2} * 0 \n+ (1/2) e^{-i gamma B t/2} e^{-i gamma B t/2} * (\u0127/2)\n+ (1/2) e^{i gamma B t/2} e^{i gamma B t/2} * (\u0127/2)\n+ (1/2) e^{i gamma B t/2} e^{-i gamma B t/2} * 0 \n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: coefficient (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} times (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} times < +y | S_z | +y > = (1/2) e^{i gamma B t} * 0 = 0.\n\nSecond term: (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} times (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} times < +y | S_z | -y > = (1/2) e^{0} * (\u0127/2) = (1/2) (1) (\u0127/2) = \u0127/4.\n\nThird term: (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} times (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} times < -y | S_z | +y > = (1/2) e^{0} * (\u0127/2) = \u0127/4.\n\nFourth term: (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} times (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} times 0 = 0.\n\nSo adding the non-zero terms: \u0127/4 + \u0127/4 = \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that's odd. So <S_z> is \u0127/2? But that can't be right because the initial state is |+z>, which has <S_z> = \u0127/2, but under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves and the expectation value should oscillate.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the matrix elements. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value directly using the state |psi(t)>.\n\nSo, |psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y>\n\nWe can compute <S_z> as the expectation value in this state.\n\nExpressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>, perhaps it's easier.\n\nWe know that |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\nand |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n          + (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z> ) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / (2)\n\nFactor out |+z> and |-z>:\n\n= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |-z> ] / 2\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n= [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + 2i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z> ] / 2\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z>\n\nNow, <S_z> is the expectation value of S_z in this state.\n\nSince |+z> and |-z> are eigenstates of S_z with eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2 respectively.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = [ cos(gamma B t/2) ]^2 (\u0127/2) + [ i sin(gamma B t/2) ]^2 (- \u0127/2 )\n\nWait, because the state is |+z> multiplied by cos and |-z> multiplied by i sin. So the square of the magnitude for each term contributes.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the expectation value is:\n\n<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>\n\n= |a|^2 (+\u0127/2) + |b|^2 (-\u0127/2), where a is the coefficient of |+z>, and b is the coefficient of |-z>.\n\nHere, a = cos(gamma B t/2), b = i sin(gamma B t/2).\n\nSo |a|^2 = cos^2(gamma B t/2)\n|b|^2 = |i|^2 sin^2(gamma B t/2) = sin^2(gamma B t/2)\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = cos^2(gamma B t/2) (\u0127/2) + sin^2(gamma B t/2) (- \u0127/2 )\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(x) - sin^2(x) ] where x = gamma B t/2.\n\nUsing the double-angle identity, cos^2(x) - sin^2(x) = cos(2x).\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos(2 * (gamma B t/2)) ) = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nSo the expectation value oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nWait, but the frequency of this oscillation is gamma B. Because the cosine term has an argument of gamma B t, which implies a frequency of gamma B / (2\u03c0) if considering angular frequency. Wait no, the angular frequency is gamma B, because the argument is gamma B t. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is gamma B.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction, and then it's suddenly turned off and turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude. We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, I remember that the magnetic moment mu is related to the spin operator S. Oh right, mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. So, mu_z would be gamma * S_z. But the question says mu is equal to gamma*S_z. So, yeah, mu is proportional to S_z.\n\nInitially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's spin will align with this field. Since the spin is 1/2, the eigenvalues for S_z are \u00b1 \u0127/2. But wait, when the magnetic field is applied along Z, the energy levels are determined by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian is H = -mu\u00b7B. Oh wait, more accurately, H = - mu \u00b7 B. Since mu is gamma S_z, and B is along Z, H becomes H = -gamma B S_z. So the energies are E = -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2) * (1/2?), Wait, wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the spin matrices for S_z are in units of \u0127. So S_z can be \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the eigenvalues for H would be E = -mu_z B, because H = -mu\u00b7B. Oh wait, mu is gamma S_z, so H = - gamma S_z B. So E = - gamma B (\u0127/2) and + gamma B (\u0127/2) for the two spin states.\n\nBut wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So mu_z is gamma S_z. So H = - mu \u00b7 B = - mu_z B when B is along Z. So H = - gamma S_z B. So the energy levels are E = - gamma B (\u0127/2) and + gamma B (\u0127/2), right? Or wait, S_z has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E = - gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So E = \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2) * (-1), wait no. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, H = - mu \u00b7 B. So since mu = gamma S, then H = -gamma S \u00b7 B. If B is in the z-direction, then H = - gamma B S_z. So the energy eigenvalues are E = - gamma B (S_z eigenvalue). And S_z eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E = -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So the two possible energies are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (+1) = - (gamma B \u0127)/2, and E_- = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (-1) = (gamma B \u0127)/2.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check that. Because sometimes the energy is given as H = - mu \u00b7 B, and mu = gamma S, so H = -gamma S \u00b7 B. So if B is along +Z, then H = -gamma B S_z.\n\nSo, when the magnetic field is applied along Z, the spin will precess, but once it's in an eigenstate, it's stationary. So the initial state is either up or down in the Z direction.\n\nBut then the magnetic field is turned off (so B=0) and then turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H' = - mu \u00b7 B', where B' is along Y. So H' = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but wait, when the field is turned off, the particle is in a state, and then when the field changes direction, the state might not be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, the process is: initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of H_initial (along Z). Then the field is turned off (H=0 for a moment), but I think the state doesn't change because the Hamiltonian is zero, so the state remains the same. Then the field is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Because B is along Y.\n\nSo the state after the field change is the same as before, but now the Hamiltonian is different. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z, which might not be an eigenstate of H'.\n\nSo the time evolution under the new Hamiltonian will cause transitions between states, leading to oscillations in observables.\n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>, because mu = gamma S. So we need to find the time dependence of <S_z>.\n\nI remember that when a system is in a state that is a superposition of energy eigenstates, the expectation value of an observable can oscillate with frequencies related to the energy differences.\n\nSo, the initial state is |psi(0)> = |+z> or |-z>, the eigenstates of S_z. Let's suppose it's |+z> for simplicity.\n\nThe new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Let me compute the eigenstates of H. The eigenvalues are found by solving H|psi> = E |psi>.\n\nBut H = - gamma B S_y. The spin matrices for S_y are a bit different. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2, respectively.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of H will be E = - gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, wait. Because H = -gamma B S_y. So S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, so H|+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y> => E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2). Similarly, E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake here because I might have confused the sign somewhere.\n\nWait, S_y is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli Y matrix. So S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. Then H = - gamma B S_y would have eigenvalues E = -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2), which are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energy difference between the two states is (E_- - E_+) = gamma B (\u0127/2) - (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the energy levels are split by gamma B \u0127. But how does this relate to the oscillation frequency?\n\nThe time evolution of a state that's a superposition of two energy eigenstates leads to oscillations with frequencies proportional to the energy differences divided by Planck's constant (h-bar).\n\nWait, the general solution when a state is a superposition of two energy eigenstates |E1> and |E2> with coefficients c1 and c2 is |psi(t)> = c1 exp(-i E1 t / \u0127) |E1> + c2 exp(-i E2 t / \u0127) |E2>.\n\nIf the state is a superposition of |E1> and |E2>, then the expectation value of an observable can oscillate with a frequency (E2 - E1)/(2\u03c0 \u0127) * 2\u03c0, which is (E2 - E1)/\u0127.\n\nWait, the time dependence comes from the phase factors. When you take the expectation value of an observable, terms like exp(i (E1 - E2) t / \u0127) and their complex conjugates will appear. So the oscillation frequency is (E2 - E1)/(2\u0127) * 2, perhaps? Wait, let me think again.\n\nThe time dependence in the expectation value of an observable (like S_z) would involve terms like e^{i (E1 - E2) t / \u0127} and e^{-i (E1 - E2) t / \u0127}, which combine to give terms proportional to cos[(E1 - E2) t / \u0127]. So the oscillation frequency is (E1 - E2)/(2\u03c0 \u0127) * 2\u03c0, which simplifies to (E1 - E2)/\u0127. So the frequency is (E1 - E2)/ (2\u03c0 \u0127) ) * 2\u03c0, which is (E1 - E2)/ \u0127.\n\nWait, let me compute (E2 - E1)/ \u0127. E2 is gamma B \u0127/2, E1 is -gamma B \u0127/2. So E2 - E1 = gamma B \u0127/2 - (-gamma B \u0127/2) = gamma B \u0127. So (E2 - E1)/ \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the frequency would be gamma B.\n\nWait, but that's the energy difference divided by \u0127. So the oscillation frequency is (E2 - E1)/(2\u03c0 \u0127) ) * 2\u03c0, which is (gamma B \u0127) / (2\u03c0 \u0127) ) * 2\u03c0 = gamma B.\n\nWait, no, let's correct that. The general formula for the oscillation frequency is (E2 - E1)/(2\u03c0 \u0127). Because when you have two states with energies E1 and E2, the transition frequency is (E2 - E1)/(2\u03c0 \u0127). So the frequency is (E2 - E1)/(2\u03c0 \u0127).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The energy difference is delta E = E2 - E1. The angular frequency (omega) is delta E / \u0127. Because E = \u0127 omega. So omega = delta E / \u0127.\n\nIn this case, delta E is gamma B \u0127. So omega = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B. So the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency in terms of cycles per second (Hz) is omega/(2\u03c0) = gamma B/(2\u03c0). But wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency in terms of how the average <mu_z> oscillates, which would be at this frequency.\n\nWait, but let's get back to the problem. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. The new Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. So the eigenstates of H are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ and E_-.\n\nSo, to find how |psi(0)> evolves under H, we need to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nThe |+y> and |-y> states can be written in terms of |+z> and |-z> as:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the initial state |+z> can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nBecause substituting:\n\n( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2) = [ (|+z> + |-z> ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / (sqrt(2)*2) )\n\nWait, let me compute this properly.\n\nWait, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo adding them: |+y> + |-y> = [ (|+z> + |-z>) + (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / sqrt(2) \n= [ 2 |+z> ] / sqrt(2) \n= sqrt(2) |+z>\n\nSo |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the initial state |+z> is a superposition of |+y> and |-y> with coefficients 1/sqrt(2) each.\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) exp(-i E_+ t/\u0127) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) exp(-i E_- t/\u0127) |-y>\n\nE_+ is the energy of |+y>, which is -gamma B (\u0127/2)\nE_- is the energy of |-y>, which is gamma B (\u0127/2)\n\nSo plugging in E_+ and E_-:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B (\u0127/2) t / \u0127 ) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) exp( -i (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) t / \u0127 ) |-y>\n\nWait, let me compute the exponents.\n\nE_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2). So E_+ t / \u0127 = [ -gamma B (\u0127/2) * t ] / \u0127 = -gamma B t /2.\n\nSimilarly, E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So E_- t / \u0127 = [ gamma B (\u0127/2) * t ] / \u0127 = gamma B t /2.\n\nSo:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |-y>\n\nWait, because E_+ is negative, the exponent for |+y> is exp( -i E_+ t/\u0127 ) = exp( i gamma B t/2 ), and for |-y>, it's exp( -i E_- t/\u0127 ) = exp( -i (gamma B (\u0127/2)) t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i gamma B t/2 ). Wait, no:\n\nWait, E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2). So E_+ t / \u0127 = (- gamma B (\u0127/2) * t ) / \u0127 = - gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo exp(-i E_+ t/ \u0127) = exp( i gamma B t/2 )\n\nSimilarly, E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So E_- t / \u0127 = gamma B t/2.\n\nSo exp(-i E_- t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i gamma B t/2 )\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y>\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me re-express this correctly.\n\nThe coefficient for |+y> is exp( -i E_+ t/\u0127 ) = exp( i gamma B t/2 )\n\nThe coefficient for |-y> is exp( -i E_- t/\u0127 ) = exp( -i (gamma B (\u0127/2) ) t / \u0127 ) ) = exp( -i gamma B t/2 )\n\nSo |psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y>\n\nNow, to find <S_z> at time t, we can compute <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nBut S_z in the |+y> and |-y> basis can be represented as a matrix. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly.\n\nAlternatively, since S_z is (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], and |+y> and |-y> are given in terms of |+z> and |-z>, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value.\n\nBut maybe a smarter approach is to express S_z in terms of the |+y> and |-y> basis.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the expectation value of S_z.\n\n< S_z > = < psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) >\n\nExpressed in the |+y> and |-y> basis, we can write this as:\n\n< psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ]* < +y | S_z | +y > (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) \n+ [ (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ]* < +y | S_z | -y > (1/sqrt(2)) exp( -i gamma B t/2 )\n+ [ (1/sqrt(2)) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ]* < -y | S_z | +y > (1/sqrt(2)) exp( i gamma B t/2 )\n+ [ (1/sqrt(2)) exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ]* < -y | S_z | -y > (1/sqrt(2)) exp( -i gamma B t/2 )\n\nBut wait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, since S_z is an observable, and the state is a superposition, perhaps we can compute it more directly.\n\nWait, S_z can be expressed in terms of the |+y> and |-y> basis. Let's find the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis.\n\nWe know that:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n|-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nWe can write S_z as a 2x2 matrix in the |+y>, |-y> basis. Since S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, and similar for |-z>.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the matrix elements.\n\nAlternatively, compute < S_z > using the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the time evolution of <S_z> directly.\n\nWait, another approach: the expectation value of S_z as a function of time. Since the state is a superposition of energy eigenstates, the expectation value oscillates.\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z>, which in the |+y>, |-y> basis is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i E_- t/\u0127} |-y>\n\nWe can plug in E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nSo E_+ t/\u0127 = (- gamma B (\u0127/2) ) * t / \u0127 = - gamma B t / 2\n\nSo e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} = e^{i gamma B t/2 }\n\nSimilarly, E_- t/\u0127 = (gamma B (\u0127/2)) t / \u0127 = gamma B t / 2\n\ne^{-i E_- t/\u0127} = e^{-i gamma B t/2 }\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y>\n\nNow, to find <S_z>, we can compute:\n\n<S_z> = < psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) >\n\nExpressed in the |+y> and |-y> basis.\n\nWe can write S_z as:\n\nS_z = (\u0127/2) [ |+z><+z| - |-z><-z| ]\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the matrix elements of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis.\n\nLet me compute the matrix elements:\n\n< +y | S_z | +y > = (\u0127/2) [ < +z | +y > ]^2 * (something?)\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to compute S_z in terms of the |+y> and |-y> states.\n\nSince S_z is (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], and the |+y> and |-y> states are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>, perhaps we can find the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis.\n\nWait, let me compute the matrix elements:\n\n< +y | S_z | +y > = (\u0127/2) [ < +y | +z > ]^2 - (\u0127/2) [ < +y | -z > ]^2 ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps a better way is to note that S_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) < +y | S_z | +y > ?\n\nWait, S_z |+y> is (\u0127/2) times the expectation value. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute S_z |+y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nWait, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\nSo S_z |+y> = (S_z |+z> + S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> - (\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) ( |+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) ( (|+y> - 2 |+y> ? ) Wait, no.\n\nWait, because |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2), and |-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2). So let's substitute these into S_z |+y>:\n\nS_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ (|+y> + |-y> )/(sqrt(2)) ) - (|+y> - |-y> )/(sqrt(2)) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ ( (|+y> + |-y> ) - (|+y> - |-y> )) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ (2 |-y> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ 2 |-y> / (2) ) ]\n= (\u0127/2) ( |-y> )\n\nSo S_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) |-y>\nSimilarly, S_z |-y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nSimilarly, S_z |-y> = (\u0127/2) (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should recompute S_z |-y>.\n\nWait, |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo S_z |-y> = (S_z |+z> - S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> - ( - \u0127/2 |+z> ) ) / sqrt(2)\n= [ (\u0127/2 |+z> + \u0127/2 |+z> ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= ( \u0127 |+z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) ( |+z> + |-z> ) ) / sqrt(2) ? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should find the matrix elements directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis is:\n\nS_z = (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] in the |+z>, |-z> basis. To find it in the |+y>, |-y> basis, we can perform a basis transformation.\n\nThe transformation matrix from |+z>, |-z> to |+y>, |-y> is:\n\nU = 1/sqrt(2) [ [1, 1], [1, -1] ]\n\nSo U^dagger is 1/sqrt(2) [ [1,1], [1,-1] ]^T = 1/sqrt(2) [ [1,1], [1,-1] ]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the columns of U are the |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nSo:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo the matrix U is:\n\nU = [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ],\n       [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2) ] ]\n\nSo, the matrix representing S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis is U^dagger * S_z (in |+z>, |-z> basis) * U.\n\nS_z in |+z>, |-z> is (\u0127/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSo, let's compute U^dagger * S_z * U.\n\nU^dagger is [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)] ]\n\nSo, compute U^dagger * S_z:\n\nU^dagger * S_z = [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)] ] * [ [\u0127/2, 0], [0, -\u0127/2] ]\n\n= [ [ (1/sqrt(2))(\u0127/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(0), (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (1/sqrt(2))(-\u0127/2) ),\n     [ (1/sqrt(2))(\u0127/2) + (-1/sqrt(2))(0), (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (-1/sqrt(2))(-\u0127/2) ) ] ]\n\nWait, actually, matrix multiplication:\n\nFirst row, first column:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (\u0127/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 = (\u0127/2)(1/sqrt(2)).\n\nFirst row, second column:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u0127/2) = (- \u0127/2)(1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSecond row, first column:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (\u0127/2) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 0 = (\u0127/2)(1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSecond row, second column:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u0127/2) = (\u0127/2)(1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo U^dagger * S_z is:\n\n[ [ \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)), - \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ],\n  [ \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)), \u0127/(2 sqrt(2)) ] ]\n\nNow multiply this by U:\n\nU is [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ],\n        [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2) ] ]\n\nSo, let's compute the product (U^dagger S_z) U.\n\nThe product will be a 2x2 matrix.\n\nFirst element (1,1):\n\nRow 1 of (U^dagger S_z) dot column 1 of U.\n\n( \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(1/\u221a2) ) + ( - \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(1/\u221a2) )\n\n= \u0127/(2\u221a2) * 1/\u221a2  - \u0127/(2\u221a2) * 1/\u221a2\n= [ \u0127/(2 * 2) ) ] - [ \u0127/(2 * 2) ) ]\n= 0.\n\nElement (1,2):\n\nRow 1 of (U^dagger S_z) dot column 2 of U.\n\n( \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(1/\u221a2) ) + ( - \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(-1/\u221a2) )\n\n= \u0127/(2*2) + \u0127/(2*2)\n= \u0127/4 + \u0127/4 = \u0127/2.\n\nElement (2,1):\n\nRow 2 of (U^dagger S_z) dot column 1 of U.\n\n( \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(1/\u221a2) ) + ( \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(1/\u221a2) )\n\n= \u0127/(4) + \u0127/(4) = \u0127/2.\n\nElement (2,2):\n\nRow 2 of (U^dagger S_z) dot column 2 of U.\n\n( \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(1/\u221a2) ) + ( \u0127/(2\u221a2) )*(-1/\u221a2) )\n\n= \u0127/(4) - \u0127/(4) = 0.\n\nSo the resulting matrix is:\n\n[ [0, \u0127/2 ],\n  [\u0127/2, 0 ] ]\n\nWhich is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli X matrix.\n\nSo, S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis is (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the same as the original S_z in the |+z>, |-z> basis. That makes sense because S_z and S_y are related by a rotation, but their matrix representations in their respective bases are the same structure.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit circular. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed with the expectation value.\n\nSo, given that, the expectation value <S_z> is given by:\n\n< S_z > = < psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) >\n\nWhich, in the |+y>, |-y> basis, can be written as:\n\n= [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} ]^* [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} ] < +y | S_z | +y > \n+ [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} ]^* [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] < +y | S_z | -y > \n+ [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ]^* [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} ] < -y | S_z | +y > \n+ [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ]^* [ (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] < -y | S_z | -y > \n\nBut from earlier, we found that in the |+y>, |-y> basis, S_z has the matrix [[0, \u0127/2], [\u0127/2, 0]]. So:\n\n< +y | S_z | +y > = 0\n< +y | S_z | -y > = \u0127/2\n< -y | S_z | +y > = \u0127/2\n< -y | S_z | -y > = 0\n\nSo substituting these in:\n\n= (1/2) e^{-i gamma B t/2} e^{i gamma B t/2} * 0 \n+ (1/2) e^{-i gamma B t/2} e^{-i gamma B t/2} * (\u0127/2)\n+ (1/2) e^{i gamma B t/2} e^{i gamma B t/2} * (\u0127/2)\n+ (1/2) e^{i gamma B t/2} e^{-i gamma B t/2} * 0 \n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: coefficient (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} times (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} times < +y | S_z | +y > = (1/2) e^{i gamma B t} * 0 = 0.\n\nSecond term: (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} times (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} times < +y | S_z | -y > = (1/2) e^{0} * (\u0127/2) = (1/2) (1) (\u0127/2) = \u0127/4.\n\nThird term: (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} times (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} times < -y | S_z | +y > = (1/2) e^{0} * (\u0127/2) = \u0127/4.\n\nFourth term: (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} times (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} times 0 = 0.\n\nSo adding the non-zero terms: \u0127/4 + \u0127/4 = \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that's odd. So <S_z> is \u0127/2? But that can't be right because the initial state is |+z>, which has <S_z> = \u0127/2, but under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves and the expectation value should oscillate.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the matrix elements. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value directly using the state |psi(t)>.\n\nSo, |psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y>\n\nWe can compute <S_z> as the expectation value in this state.\n\nExpressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>, perhaps it's easier.\n\nWe know that |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\nand |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n          + (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z> ) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / (2)\n\nFactor out |+z> and |-z>:\n\n= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |-z> ] / 2\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n= [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + 2i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z> ] / 2\n\nSo,\n\n|psi(t)> = cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z>\n\nNow, <S_z> is the expectation value of S_z in this state.\n\nSince |+z> and |-z> are eigenstates of S_z with eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2 respectively.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = [ cos(gamma B t/2) ]^2 (\u0127/2) + [ i sin(gamma B t/2) ]^2 (- \u0127/2 )\n\nWait, because the state is |+z> multiplied by cos and |-z> multiplied by i sin. So the square of the magnitude for each term contributes.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the expectation value is:\n\n<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>\n\n= |a|^2 (+\u0127/2) + |b|^2 (-\u0127/2), where a is the coefficient of |+z>, and b is the coefficient of |-z>.\n\nHere, a = cos(gamma B t/2), b = i sin(gamma B t/2).\n\nSo |a|^2 = cos^2(gamma B t/2)\n|b|^2 = |i|^2 sin^2(gamma B t/2) = sin^2(gamma B t/2)\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = cos^2(gamma B t/2) (\u0127/2) + sin^2(gamma B t/2) (- \u0127/2 )\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(x) - sin^2(x) ] where x = gamma B t/2.\n\nUsing the double-angle identity, cos^2(x) - sin^2(x) = cos(2x).\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos(2 * (gamma B t/2)) ) = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nSo the expectation value oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nSo <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nWait, but the frequency of this oscillation is gamma B. Because the cosine term has an argument of gamma B t, which implies a frequency of gamma B / (2\u03c0) if considering angular frequency. Wait no, the angular frequency is gamma B, because the argument is gamma B t. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is gamma B. So the answer should be B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$ in a changing magnetic field. Initially, the magnetic field is along the $+Z$ direction, and the particle is in an eigenstate of $S_z$. When the field is suddenly turned off and reactivated along the $+Y$ direction, the Hamiltonian changes to $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. The new Hamiltonian has eigenstates $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, corresponding to eigenvalues $E_+ = -\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$ and $E_- = \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}$, respectively.\n\nThe initial state $|+z\\rangle$ is expressed as a superposition of $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$:\n\\[\n|+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle).\n\\]\nUnder the new Hamiltonian, the time-evolved state becomes:\n\\[\n|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} e^{i\\gamma B t/2} |+y\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} e^{-i\\gamma B t/2} |-y\\rangle.\n\\]\n\nTo compute the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle$, we calculate $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ using the time-evolved state. In the $|+y\\rangle, |-y\\rangle$ basis, $S_z$ has the matrix representation:\n\\[\nS_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nSubstituting $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$ into $\\langle S_z \\rangle$, the expectation value oscillates as:\n\\[\n\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n\\]\nThus, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is determined by the argument of the cosine term, $\\gamma B$, which corresponds to the angular frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is $\\gamma B$.\n\nFrom the given options:\n- **A)** $\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}$: Incorrect, as the frequency is not halved.\n- **B)** $\\gamma B$: Correct, matches the derived result.\n- **C)** $\\sqrt{2}\\gamma B$: Incorrect, no factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ appears.\n- **D)** $\\frac{\\gamma B}{\\sqrt{2}}$: Incorrect, as the frequency is not reduced by $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe correct answer is **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment in different magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nSo the setup is: the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma multiplied by the Sz component. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction, and the magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, leading to time evolution of the spin state.\n\nWait, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * Sz. So Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the energy is proportional to the dot product of mu and B.\n\nInitially, when the magnetic field is along +Z, the Hamiltonian would be H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B. But wait, when the field is along Z, H_initial = - mu_z * B = - gamma * Sz * B. But wait, isn't the energy actually proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field? So H = - mu \u00b7 B. Since mu is along +Z, and B is also along +Z, the energy is minimized, so the system is in the ground state.\n\nBut then the field is turned off and another one is applied along +Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H_new = - mu \u00b7 B', where B' is along Y. So H_new = - gamma * S_y * B. Wait, because mu is gamma S, so mu \u00b7 B' (pointing along Y) is gamma * S_y * B. So H_new is -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me write this down.\n\nThe magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction is H = - mu \u00b7 B = - gamma S \u00b7 (B direction) * B. Since B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nBut wait, the spin operators are S_x, S_y, S_z. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y.\n\nI remember that the energy eigenstates for spin in a magnetic field are the eigenstates of the spin component along the field direction. So when the field is along Y, the eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues proportional to +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.\n\nBut the initial state of the particle is aligned with the +Z direction, which would be the eigenstate of S_z. So the initial state is |+z> before the field changes.\n\nWhen the field is suddenly switched from Z to Y, the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously. So the initial state after the field change is still |+z>, but now the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the time evolution will cause the state to evolve under H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but the time evolution is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The state will evolve with a phase factor determined by the energy eigenvalues.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for H are E = \u00b1 (gamma B hbar / 2), since S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 hbar/2 multiplied by gamma B. So E_plus = (gamma B hbar / 2) * (-1) because H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, no, wait: H = - gamma B S_y. So S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 hbar/2. So H has eigenvalues - gamma B (\u00b1 hbar/2) ) = \u00b1 (gamma B hbar / 2) * (-1). Wait, no, let me compute:\n\nH = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo for eigenstates |+y> and |-y>, S_y |+y> = (hbar/2) |+y>, so H|+y> = - gamma B (hbar/2) |+y> = E_+ |+y>, so E_+ = - (gamma B hbar) / 2.\n\nSimilarly, E_- = + (gamma B hbar) / 2.\n\nWait, no, wait: H is - gamma B S_y. So if S_y |+y> = (hbar/2)|+y>, then H|+y> = - gamma B (hbar/2) |+y> \u2192 E_+ = - (gamma B hbar / 2).\n\nHmm. So the initial state is |+z>. Let's express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y> because the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the Y basis.\n\nWait, the |+y> and |-y> states are linear combinations of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nI recall that |+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2). Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, the correct expressions are:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/\u221a2,\n\nand |-y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z>)/\u221a2.\n\nWait, I think that's correct because, for example, the eigenstates of S_y are superpositions of S_z eigenstates. Let me confirm: when you measure S_y, the possible outcomes are \u00b1 \u0127/2, and the corresponding states are |+y> and |-y>, which are combinations of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nSo the initial state is |+z>, which can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/\u221a2. Because:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/\u221a2,\n\nand similarly,\n\n|\u2212z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/\u221a2.\n\nSo when the system is in |+z>, in terms of the new basis, it's (|+y> + |-y>)/\u221a2.\n\nNow, the time evolution under H is determined by the energies E_+ and E_-.\n\nEach component will evolve with a phase factor e^(-i E t / \u0127).\n\nSo, the time evolution of |+z> under H is:\n\n\u03c8(t) = (e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t/\u0127} |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ = - (gamma B \u0127 / 2),\n\nE_- = + (gamma B \u0127 / 2).\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ e^{-i (-gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 } |+y> + e^{-i (gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 } |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nFirst term: e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |+y>.\n\nSecond term: e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |-y>.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |+y> + e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nWe can factor this as:\n\n= [ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} (|+y> ) + e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} (|-y> ) ] / sqrt(2).\n\nBut we can express this in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z> again. Let me write |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nAs I said earlier,\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2),\n\n|-y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSubstituting these into \u03c8(t):\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} (|+z> + |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) + e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} (|+z> - |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2).\n\nLet me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from each term.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = [1/sqrt(2) (e^{i theta} (|+z> + |\u2212z>) ) + 1/sqrt(2) (e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |\u2212z> )) ) ] / sqrt(2),\n\nwhere theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should compute this step by step.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: e^{i theta} * (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSecond term: e^{-i theta} * (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ (e^{i theta} (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |\u2212z> )) ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, because each |+y> and |-y> is divided by sqrt(2), and then we have another 1/sqrt(2) from the substitution.\n\nSo, overall, it's [ ... ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) ) \u2192 [ ... ] / 2.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) ] / 2.\n\nLet me distribute the terms:\n\n= [ (e^{i theta} |+z> + e^{i theta} |\u2212z> ) + (e^{-i theta} |+z> - e^{-i theta} |\u2212z> ) ] / 2.\n\nGroup the |+z> and |\u2212z> terms:\n\n= [ (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) |+z> + (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) |\u2212z> ] / 2.\n\nUsing Euler's formula, e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos(theta), and e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> + 2i sin(theta) |\u2212z> ] / 2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z> ].\n\nSo, the state at time t is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z>,\n\nwhere theta = (gamma B t ) / 2.\n\nWait, because theta is gamma B t / 2. So yes.\n\nNow, the question is about the average (expected value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nThe average value <mu_z> is gamma <S_z>.\n\nSo, we can compute <S_z> for the state |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nBecause S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>,\n\nand S_z |\u2212z> = (- \u0127/2) |\u2212z>.\n\nSo, compute <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nLet me write |\u03c8(t)> as:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z>.\n\nSo, the conjugate transpose is:\n\n<\u03c8(t)| = cos(theta) <+z| - i sin(theta) <\u2212z|.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = [ cos(theta) <+z| + (-i) sin(theta) <\u2212z| ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z> ].\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: cos(theta) * cos(theta) <+z| S_z |+z> = cos^2(theta) * (\u0127/2).\n\nSecond term: cos(theta) * i sin(theta) <+z| S_z |\u2212z> = i cos(theta) sin(theta) * 0, because <+z| S_z |\u2212z> is zero (orthogonal states).\n\nThird term: (-i sin(theta)) * cos(theta) <\u2212z| S_z |+z> = (-i sin(theta) cos(theta)) * 0.\n\nFourth term: (-i sin(theta)) * i sin(theta) <\u2212z| S_z |\u2212z> = (-i^2) sin^2(theta) * (-\u0127/2).\n\nBecause <\u2212z| S_z |\u2212z> = (-\u0127/2).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n<S_z> = cos^2(theta) (\u0127/2) + (-i^2) sin^2(theta) (-\u0127/2).\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\nTerm 1: cos\u00b2(theta) * (\u0127/2).\n\nTerm 4: (-i)(i) is (-i\u00b2) = -(-1) = +1. So the term is (1) sin\u00b2(theta) * (-\u0127/2).\n\nSo,\n\nTerm 4: (+1) sin\u00b2(theta) * (-\u0127/2) = - (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2(theta) - sin\u00b2(theta) ].\n\nWhich simplifies to (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta), since cos(2 theta) = cos\u00b2(theta) - sin\u00b2(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta).\n\nBut theta is (gamma B t) / 2.\n\nSo,\n\n2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nNow, mu_z is gamma times S_z, so <mu_z> is gamma times <S_z>.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma * <S_z> = gamma * ( \u0127/(2) ) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nBut wait, wait, <S_z> is (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta), and theta is (gamma B t)/2. So 2 theta is gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nWait, but wait: gamma has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1) or something like that, and B is in Tesla. Let me think about the units for a moment, but maybe that's not necessary here.\n\nThe question asks about the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>. Since cos oscillates at a frequency equal to the coefficient of t inside the cosine, divided by 2\u03c0. But in our expression, the argument is gamma B t. So the angular frequency omega is gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency f is omega/(2pi) \u2192 gamma B/(2 pi), but wait the question is about the frequency, which is omega/(2 pi). But let me check the options.\n\nWait, the options are given in terms of gamma B multiplied by some factor. Let's see.\n\nWait, but looking back: <mu_z> = (gamma \u0127 / 2) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nWait, but wait: in our expression, we have <mu_z> proportional to cos(gamma B t), so the oscillation frequency is gamma B / (2 pi).\n\nWait, but the options don't have 2 pi factors. Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation of <mu_z>.\n\nWait, let me retrace.\n\nEarlier, I found that <S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta), where theta = (gamma B t) / 2.\n\nSo, 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nSo <S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nThen, mu_z = gamma S_z, so <mu_z> = gamma * <S_z> = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So the oscillation is cos( gamma B t ), so the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi), but wait the question is asking for the oscillation frequency. So, the period is 2 pi / (gamma B), and the frequency is (gamma B)/(2 pi).\n\nWait, but the options don't have 2 pi in them. The options are A) gamma B/2, B) gamma B, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference between the states.\n\nIn the system, when the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y, the energy levels are E_+ = - gamma B (hbar/2), and E_- = gamma B (hbar/2).\n\nThe energy difference between E_+ and E_- is (gamma B hbar).\n\nThe transition frequency is (E_+ - E_-)/hbar = (gamma B hbar ) / hbar ) = gamma B.\n\nWait, but in our case, the state is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>, so the energy difference leads to oscillations in the expectation values.\n\nThe frequency of oscillation in expectation values is given by (E_+ - E_-)/hbar, which is (gamma B hbar) / hbar = gamma B.\n\nSo the angular frequency omega is gamma B.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency f is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B/(2 pi).\n\nBut looking back at the options, they don't have 2 pi factors, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the question says, what is the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component.\n\nWait, from our earlier calculation, <mu_z> = (gamma \u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ). So the function oscillates with frequency gamma B. But wait, no, because the argument of the cosine is gamma B t. So the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the frequency is (gamma B)/(2 pi). But none of the options have a denominator with 2 pi. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption about the energy levels is wrong. Let me re-examine the Hamiltonian.\n\nH = - mu \u00b7 B.\n\nmu = gamma S, so H = - gamma S \u00b7 B.\n\nWhen B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are E = - gamma B (hbar/2) and + gamma B (hbar/2), because S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 hbar/2.\n\nThe energy difference between these two levels is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B hbar/2) - (+ gamma B hbar/2) ) = - gamma B hbar.\n\nWait, wait, no: E_+ is the eigenvalue for |+y>, which is (-gamma B) (hbar/2), and E_- is (+gamma B)(hbar/2).\n\nSo E_+ = - (gamma B hbar )/2,\n\nE_- = + (gamma B hbar )/2.\n\nSo the energy difference is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B hbar/2 ) - (- gamma B hbar /2 ) = gamma B hbar.\n\nSo the energy difference is gamma B hbar.\n\nThe frequency associated with transitions between these states is (E_- - E_+)/hbar = gamma B.\n\nSo the angular frequency omega is gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B / (2 pi). But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm not interpreting the question correctly.\n\nWait, the question is about the oscillation of <mu_z>, which is the z-component of the magnetic moment. Let me think about the time dependence of this expectation value.\n\nFrom our earlier calculation, <mu_z> = (gamma \u0127 / 2 ) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nSo the time dependence is cos( gamma B t ), meaning that the oscillation frequency is (gamma B) / (2 pi ), but that's the frequency in Hz (cycles per second). But the options are given in terms of gamma B multiplied by some factor, not involving pi.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the angular frequency, not the frequency. Because in physics, sometimes 'frequency' refers to angular frequency.\n\nIn our case, the argument of the cosine is gamma B t, which is the angular frequency. So the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B.\n\nSo the answer would be option B.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The energy levels are E_+ and E_-, so the energy difference is gamma B hbar. The transition frequency is (E_- - E_+)/hbar = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation of the expectation value is at this frequency.\n\nSo the angular frequency omega is gamma B, so the oscillation frequency f is gamma B / (2 pi).\n\nBut the question says, \"what is its oscillation frequency?\" So if it's referring to the angular frequency, then the answer is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the frequency in terms of cycles per second, then it would be gamma B/(2 pi), which is not an option.\n\nSo looking at the options, the only one matching gamma B is option B. So I think the answer is B) gamma B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and replaced with a magnetic field along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  \n   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, i.e., $|+z\\rangle$. When the magnetic field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the new Hamiltonian becomes:\n   \\[\n   H = -\\mu \\cdot B = -\\gamma B S_y.\n   \\]\n   The eigenstates of $H$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues:\n   \\[\n   E_+ = -\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}, \\quad E_- = \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Time Evolution**:  \n   The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ is expressed in terms of the new eigenstates:\n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle).\n   \\]\n   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:\n   \\[\n   \\psi(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{-iE_+t/\\hbar} |+y\\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\\hbar} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   Substituting the eigenvalues $E_+$ and $E_-$, the time-dependent state becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\psi(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{i\\gamma B t/2} |+y\\rangle + e^{-i\\gamma B t/2} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expectation Value of $\\mu_z$**:  \n   The $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ is computed using the time-evolved state. After simplifications, it is found that:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   This shows that $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ oscillates with a cosine dependence on time, where the angular frequency of oscillation is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  \n   The question asks for the oscillation frequency.

From the above result, the angular frequency is:\n   \\[\n   \\omega = \\gamma B.\n   \\]\n\n### Evaluation of Options:\n- **Option A ($\\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The factor of $1/2$ is not present in the angular frequency derived above.\n- **Option B ($\\gamma B$)**: Correct. This matches the angular frequency $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n- **Option C ($\\sqrt{2} \\gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ in the angular frequency.\n- **Option D ($\\gamma B / \\sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment in different magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nSo the setup is: the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma multiplied by the Sz component. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction, and the magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, leading to time evolution of the spin state.\n\nWait, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * Sz. So Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the energy is proportional to the dot product of mu and B.\n\nInitially, when the magnetic field is along +Z, the Hamiltonian would be H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B. But wait, when the field is along Z, H_initial = - mu_z * B = - gamma * Sz * B. But wait, isn't the energy actually proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field? So H = - mu \u00b7 B. Since mu is along +Z, and B is also along +Z, the energy is minimized, so the system is in the ground state.\n\nBut then the field is turned off and another one is applied along +Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H_new = - mu \u00b7 B', where B' is along Y. So H_new = - gamma * S_y * B. Wait, because mu is gamma S, so mu \u00b7 B' (pointing along Y) is gamma * S_y * B. So H_new is -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me write this down.\n\nThe magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction is H = - mu \u00b7 B = - gamma S \u00b7 (B direction) * B. Since B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nBut wait, the spin operators are S_x, S_y, S_z. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y.\n\nI remember that the energy eigenstates for spin in a magnetic field are the eigenstates of the spin component along the field direction. So when the field is along Y, the eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues proportional to +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.\n\nBut the initial state of the particle is aligned with the +Z direction, which would be the eigenstate of S_z. So the initial state is |+z> before the field changes.\n\nWhen the field is suddenly switched from Z to Y, the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously. So the initial state after the field change is still |+z>, but now the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the time evolution will cause the state to evolve under H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but the time evolution is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The state will evolve with a phase factor determined by the energy eigenvalues.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for H are E = \u00b1 (gamma B hbar / 2), since S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 hbar/2 multiplied by gamma B. So E_plus = (gamma B hbar / 2) * (-1) because H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, no, wait: H = - gamma B S_y. So S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 hbar/2. So H has eigenvalues - gamma B (\u00b1 hbar/2) ) = \u00b1 (gamma B hbar / 2) * (-1). Wait, no, let me compute:\n\nH = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo for eigenstates |+y> and |-y>, S_y |+y> = (hbar/2) |+y>, so H|+y> = - gamma B (hbar/2) |+y> = E_+ |+y>, so E_+ = - (gamma B hbar) / 2.\n\nSimilarly, E_- = + (gamma B hbar) / 2.\n\nWait, no, wait: H is - gamma B S_y. So if S_y |+y> = (hbar/2)|+y>, then H|+y> = - gamma B (hbar/2) |+y> \u2192 E_+ = - (gamma B hbar / 2).\n\nHmm. So the initial state is |+z>. Let's express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y> because the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the Y basis.\n\nWait, the |+y> and |-y> states are linear combinations of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nI recall that |+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2). Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, the correct expressions are:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/\u221a2,\n\nand |-y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z>)/\u221a2.\n\nWait, I think that's correct because, for example, the eigenstates of S_y are superpositions of S_z eigenstates. Let me confirm: when you measure S_y, the possible outcomes are \u00b1 \u0127/2, and the corresponding states are |+y> and |-y>, which are combinations of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nSo the initial state is |+z>, which can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/\u221a2. Because:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/\u221a2,\n\nand similarly,\n\n|\u2212z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/\u221a2.\n\nSo when the system is in |+z>, in terms of the new basis, it's (|+y> + |-y>)/\u221a2.\n\nNow, the time evolution under H is determined by the energies E_+ and E_-.\n\nEach component will evolve with a phase factor e^(-i E t / \u0127).\n\nSo, the time evolution of |+z> under H is:\n\n\u03c8(t) = (e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t/\u0127} |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ = - (gamma B \u0127 / 2),\n\nE_- = + (gamma B \u0127 / 2).\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ e^{-i (-gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 } |+y> + e^{-i (gamma B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 } |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nFirst term: e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |+y>.\n\nSecond term: e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |-y>.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |+y> + e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nWe can factor this as:\n\n= [ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} (|+y> ) + e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} (|-y> ) ] / sqrt(2).\n\nBut we can express this in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z> again. Let me write |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nAs I said earlier,\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2),\n\n|-y> = (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSubstituting these into \u03c8(t):\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} (|+z> + |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) + e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} (|+z> - |\u2212z> )/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2).\n\nLet me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from each term.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = [1/sqrt(2) (e^{i theta} (|+z> + |\u2212z>) ) + 1/sqrt(2) (e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |\u2212z> )) ) ] / sqrt(2),\n\nwhere theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should compute this step by step.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: e^{i theta} * (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSecond term: e^{-i theta} * (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ (e^{i theta} (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |\u2212z> )) ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, because each |+y> and |-y> is divided by sqrt(2), and then we have another 1/sqrt(2) from the substitution.\n\nSo, overall, it's [ ... ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) ) \u2192 [ ... ] / 2.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |\u2212z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |\u2212z> ) ] / 2.\n\nLet me distribute the terms:\n\n= [ (e^{i theta} |+z> + e^{i theta} |\u2212z> ) + (e^{-i theta} |+z> - e^{-i theta} |\u2212z> ) ] / 2.\n\nGroup the |+z> and |\u2212z> terms:\n\n= [ (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) |+z> + (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) |\u2212z> ] / 2.\n\nUsing Euler's formula, e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos(theta), and e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> + 2i sin(theta) |\u2212z> ] / 2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z> ].\n\nSo, the state at time t is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z>,\n\nwhere theta = (gamma B t ) / 2.\n\nWait, because theta is gamma B t / 2. So yes.\n\nNow, the question is about the average (expected value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nThe average value <mu_z> is gamma <S_z>.\n\nSo, we can compute <S_z> for the state |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nBecause S_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>,\n\nand S_z |\u2212z> = (- \u0127/2) |\u2212z>.\n\nSo, compute <\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nLet me write |\u03c8(t)> as:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z>.\n\nSo, the conjugate transpose is:\n\n<\u03c8(t)| = cos(theta) <+z| - i sin(theta) <\u2212z|.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = [ cos(theta) <+z| + (-i) sin(theta) <\u2212z| ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |\u2212z> ].\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: cos(theta) * cos(theta) <+z| S_z |+z> = cos^2(theta) * (\u0127/2).\n\nSecond term: cos(theta) * i sin(theta) <+z| S_z |\u2212z> = i cos(theta) sin(theta) * 0, because <+z| S_z |\u2212z> is zero (orthogonal states).\n\nThird term: (-i sin(theta)) * cos(theta) <\u2212z| S_z |+z> = (-i sin(theta) cos(theta)) * 0.\n\nFourth term: (-i sin(theta)) * i sin(theta) <\u2212z| S_z |\u2212z> = (-i^2) sin^2(theta) * (-\u0127/2).\n\nBecause <\u2212z| S_z |\u2212z> = (-\u0127/2).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n<S_z> = cos^2(theta) (\u0127/2) + (-i^2) sin^2(theta) (-\u0127/2).\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\nTerm 1: cos\u00b2(theta) * (\u0127/2).\n\nTerm 4: (-i)(i) is (-i\u00b2) = -(-1) = +1. So the term is (1) sin\u00b2(theta) * (-\u0127/2).\n\nSo,\n\nTerm 4: (+1) sin\u00b2(theta) * (-\u0127/2) = - (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2(theta) - sin\u00b2(theta) ].\n\nWhich simplifies to (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta), since cos(2 theta) = cos\u00b2(theta) - sin\u00b2(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta).\n\nBut theta is (gamma B t) / 2.\n\nSo,\n\n2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n<S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nNow, mu_z is gamma times S_z, so <mu_z> is gamma times <S_z>.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma * <S_z> = gamma * ( \u0127/(2) ) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nBut wait, wait, <S_z> is (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta), and theta is (gamma B t)/2. So 2 theta is gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nWait, but wait: gamma has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1) or something like that, and B is in Tesla. Let me think about the units for a moment, but maybe that's not necessary here.\n\nThe question asks about the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>. Since cos oscillates at a frequency equal to the coefficient of t inside the cosine, divided by 2\u03c0. But in our expression, the argument is gamma B t. So the angular frequency omega is gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency f is omega/(2pi) \u2192 gamma B/(2 pi), but wait the question is about the frequency, which is omega/(2 pi). But let me check the options.\n\nWait, the options are given in terms of gamma B multiplied by some factor. Let's see.\n\nWait, but looking back: <mu_z> = (gamma \u0127 / 2) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nWait, but wait: in our expression, we have <mu_z> proportional to cos(gamma B t), so the oscillation frequency is gamma B / (2 pi).\n\nWait, but the options don't have 2 pi factors. Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation of <mu_z>.\n\nWait, let me retrace.\n\nEarlier, I found that <S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta), where theta = (gamma B t) / 2.\n\nSo, 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nSo <S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nThen, mu_z = gamma S_z, so <mu_z> = gamma * <S_z> = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So the oscillation is cos( gamma B t ), so the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi), but wait the question is asking for the oscillation frequency. So, the period is 2 pi / (gamma B), and the frequency is (gamma B)/(2 pi).\n\nWait, but the options don't have 2 pi in them. The options are A) gamma B/2, B) gamma B, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference between the states.\n\nIn the system, when the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y, the energy levels are E_+ = - gamma B (hbar/2), and E_- = gamma B (hbar/2).\n\nThe energy difference between E_+ and E_- is (gamma B hbar).\n\nThe transition frequency is (E_+ - E_-)/hbar = (gamma B hbar ) / hbar ) = gamma B.\n\nWait, but in our case, the state is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>, so the energy difference leads to oscillations in the expectation values.\n\nThe frequency of oscillation in expectation values is given by (E_+ - E_-)/hbar, which is (gamma B hbar) / hbar = gamma B.\n\nSo the angular frequency omega is gamma B.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency f is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B/(2 pi).\n\nBut looking back at the options, they don't have 2 pi factors, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the question says, what is the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component.\n\nWait, from our earlier calculation, <mu_z> = (gamma \u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ). So the function oscillates with frequency gamma B. But wait, no, because the argument of the cosine is gamma B t. So the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the frequency is (gamma B)/(2 pi). But none of the options have a denominator with 2 pi. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption about the energy levels is wrong. Let me re-examine the Hamiltonian.\n\nH = - mu \u00b7 B.\n\nmu = gamma S, so H = - gamma S \u00b7 B.\n\nWhen B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are E = - gamma B (hbar/2) and + gamma B (hbar/2), because S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 hbar/2.\n\nThe energy difference between these two levels is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B hbar/2) - (+ gamma B hbar/2) ) = - gamma B hbar.\n\nWait, wait, no: E_+ is the eigenvalue for |+y>, which is (-gamma B) (hbar/2), and E_- is (+gamma B)(hbar/2).\n\nSo E_+ = - (gamma B hbar )/2,\n\nE_- = + (gamma B hbar )/2.\n\nSo the energy difference is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B hbar/2 ) - (- gamma B hbar /2 ) = gamma B hbar.\n\nSo the energy difference is gamma B hbar.\n\nThe frequency associated with transitions between these states is (E_- - E_+)/hbar = gamma B.\n\nSo the angular frequency omega is gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B / (2 pi). But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm not interpreting the question correctly.\n\nWait, the question is about the oscillation of <mu_z>, which is the z-component of the magnetic moment. Let me think about the time dependence of this expectation value.\n\nFrom our earlier calculation, <mu_z> = (gamma \u0127 / 2 ) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nSo the time dependence is cos( gamma B t ), meaning that the oscillation frequency is (gamma B) / (2 pi ), but that's the frequency in Hz (cycles per second). But the options are given in terms of gamma B multiplied by some factor, not involving pi.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the angular frequency, not the frequency. Because in physics, sometimes 'frequency' refers to angular frequency.\n\nIn our case, the argument of the cosine is gamma B t, which is the angular frequency. So the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B.\n\nSo the answer would be option B.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The energy levels are E_+ and E_-, so the energy difference is gamma B hbar. The transition frequency is (E_- - E_+)/hbar = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation of the expectation value is at this frequency.\n\nSo the angular frequency omega is gamma B, so the oscillation frequency f is gamma B / (2 pi).\n\nBut the question says, \"what is its oscillation frequency?\" So if it's referring to the angular frequency, then the answer is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the frequency in terms of cycles per second, then it would be gamma B/(2 pi), which is not an option.\n\nSo looking at the options, the only one matching gamma B is option B. So I think the answer is B) gamma B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and replaced with a magnetic field along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  \n   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, i.e., $|+z\\rangle$. When the magnetic field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the new Hamiltonian becomes:\n   \\[\n   H = -\\mu \\cdot B = -\\gamma B S_y.\n   \\]\n   The eigenstates of $H$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues:\n   \\[\n   E_+ = -\\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}, \\quad E_- = \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Time Evolution**:  \n   The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ is expressed in terms of the new eigenstates:\n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle).\n   \\]\n   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:\n   \\[\n   \\psi(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{-iE_+t/\\hbar} |+y\\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\\hbar} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   Substituting the eigenvalues $E_+$ and $E_-$, the time-dependent state becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\psi(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{i\\gamma B t/2} |+y\\rangle + e^{-i\\gamma B t/2} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expectation Value of $\\mu_z$**:  \n   The $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ is computed using the time-evolved state. After simplifications, it is found that:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   This shows that $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ oscillates with a cosine dependence on time, where the angular frequency of oscillation is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  \n   The question asks for the oscillation frequency. In physics, \"frequency\" often refers to the angular frequency $\\omega$, which is the coefficient of $t$ in the cosine term. From the above result, the angular frequency is:\n   \\[\n   \\omega = \\gamma B.\n   \\]\n\n### Evaluation of Options:\n- **Option A ($\\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The factor of $1/2$ is not present in the angular frequency derived above.\n- **Option B ($\\gamma B$)**: Correct. This matches the angular frequency $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n- **Option C ($\\sqrt{2} \\gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ in the angular frequency.\n- **Option D ($\\gamma B / \\sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The factor of $1/\\sqrt{2}$ is not present in the angular frequency.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$.  \n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is about a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The average z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating, and we need to find the oscillation frequency.\n\nHmm. Spin-1/2 particles... I remember they have spin angular momentum, and when placed in a magnetic field, their magnetic moment interacts with the field. The magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * S, right? Or wait, wait. Oh, wait, the question says mu = gamma * Sz. So it's specifically the z-component of spin? Or is it the entire spin? Hmm, that might be important.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think. The magnetic moment for a spin is usually mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin vector. But in this case, the problem states mu = gamma * Sz. That's interesting. So maybe mu is just the component along z? Or perhaps it's a different setup. Maybe the particle's magnetic moment is only in the z-direction initially, but when the magnetic field changes direction, the interaction changes.\n\nWait, but the initial magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's magnetic moment would align with that. When the field is turned off, the spin isn't influenced anymore\u2014so it should stay in its state, right? But then the field is turned on along Y. So the system now has a magnetic field in Y. So the magnetic moment is now interacting with this new field.\n\nWait, but the problem says mu = gamma * Sz. So perhaps the magnetic moment is proportional only to the z-component of spin. Hmm, but when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian would involve the spin in the Y direction. But the magnetic moment is based on Sz, so maybe the Hamiltonian is different.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the setup. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field via the Zeeman term. The energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, then the energy becomes proportional to S_y.\n\nBut in our case, mu is given as gamma * Sz. So substituting that into the energy, the energy would be - (gamma Sz) \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, then Sz \u00b7 B is zero because Sz is along Z and B is along Y. Wait, that would imply the energy is zero, which can't be right. Because that would mean no interaction, but the question says the average z-component oscillates. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the magnetic moment is the vector (mu_x, mu_y, mu_z) = gamma (S_x, S_y, S_z). But the question says mu = gamma Sz. Oh, wait, maybe the magnetic moment is only the z-component, mu_z = gamma S_z. But that would imply that in the presence of a magnetic field along Y, the interaction is mu \u00b7 B = gamma S_z * B_y. But S_z and B_y are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. So no interaction? That can't be right either, because the average z-component would then not oscillate. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe the magnetic moment is the entire vector, mu = gamma * S, so mu_x = gamma S_x, etc. Then the interaction energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So when B is along Y, the energy is proportional to -gamma S_y B.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is when B was along Z. So the system was in an eigenstate of S_z. Then when the field is turned off, the spin state remains the same. But when the field is turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. So the system's state will evolve under this new Hamiltonian.\n\nAh, so the problem is about the transition from a state that's an eigenstate of S_z to a new Hamiltonian involving S_y. This would cause the expectation value of S_z to oscillate over time.\n\nSo the system's time evolution is determined by the new Hamiltonian. The initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's consider the spin-1/2 case. The eigenstates of S_z are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2. But when the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, the energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_y.\n\nSo, the initial state is, say, |+z> (or |-z>). The new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, let me be precise. The interaction energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So mu is gamma S, and B is along Y, so mu \u00b7 B = gamma S \u00b7 (B_y direction) = gamma B S_y. So H = -mu \u00b7 B = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but in terms of units, the Hamiltonian should have units of energy. So H = -gamma B S_y. But S_y has units of angular momentum (like \u0127), so gamma must have units that make this product energy. Okay.\n\nSo the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Alternatively, H can be written as proportional to S_y. Let me think about the energy levels. For a spin-1/2 particle, S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the energies would be E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = -gamma B \u0127. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, E_+ is -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- is gamma B (\u0127/2). So the difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127. So the energy difference is gamma B \u0127.\n\nWait, but the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So frequency omega = (E_2 - E_1)/\u0127. So (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B. Hmm, but wait, I might have gotten the signs wrong. Let me double-check.\n\nH = -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (\u0127/2) for |+y> and E = gamma B (\u0127/2) for |-y>? Or wait, no, the eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the time evolution operator. The initial state is |+z> or |-z>, and under H = -gamma B S_y, the time evolution will cause the state to precess.\n\nThe time evolution of an initial state |psi(0)> under H is given by |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |psi(0)>.\n\nSo the state will evolve into a superposition of the energy eigenstates, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nWe are to find the oscillation frequency of the expectation value of S_z. So let's compute <S_z> as a function of time.\n\nLet me model this. Let's take the initial state as |+z> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) in some basis, but perhaps it's easier to write it in the eigenbasis of S_z.\n\nWait, |+z> is the state where S_z is \u0127/2, so it's (1, 0) in the Sz basis. The Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. Let me write H in matrix form.\n\nIn the Sz basis (|+z>, |-z>), S_y is represented as (\u0127/2) times the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So H = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So H is a 2x2 matrix with elements [[0, -i gamma B \u0127/2], [i gamma B \u0127/2, 0]].\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). Let's compute this.\n\nH has eigenvalues \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2), because the eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2, multiplied by -gamma B (\u0127/2) in H. Wait, let me compute H's eigenvalues. H is proportional to S_y, so H = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * S_y. So the eigenvalues of H would be -gamma B (\u0127/2) times the eigenvalues of S_y, which are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (\u0127/2) = -gamma B \u0127^2/4? Wait, no, wait. Wait, S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So H would have eigenvalues -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (\u00b1 \u0127/2) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So H = -gamma B * S_y. So the eigenvalues of H would be -gamma B * (\u00b1 \u0127/2) = \u00b1 (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) ? No, wait, no. H is H = -gamma B * S_y. So if S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, then H has eigenvalues -gamma B * (\u00b1 \u0127/2) = \u2213 gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me think again. Let me write H = -gamma B * (S_y). So if S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, then H |+y> = -gamma B * (\u0127/2) |+y>. Similarly, H |-y> = gamma B * (\u0127/2) |-y> ?\n\nWait, no. S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = -gamma B (S_y) |+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y>. Similarly, H |-y> = -gamma B (S_y) |-y> = gamma B (\u0127/2) |-y> because S_y |-y> = (-\u0127/2) |-y>. So the eigenvalues of H are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nSo the energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = gamma B (\u0127/2) - (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is this energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So frequency omega = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B. Hmm, so the frequency is gamma B. But wait, looking at the options, option B is gamma B. But wait, another possibility is that I made a mistake in the sign. Let me think again.\n\nWait, but the initial state is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of H. So the state will evolve in time, and the expectation value of S_z will oscillate. The time dependence will involve terms like e^{-i (E_+ - E_-) t / \u0127}.\n\nWait, the general formula for the expectation value of an observable that's not in the energy basis will involve terms with the difference in energies. So the oscillation frequency is (E_2 - E_1)/\u0127. In this case, E_2 is E_+ and E_1 is E_-? Or the other way around.\n\nWait, the energy difference is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) ) = -gamma B \u0127. So the absolute value is gamma B \u0127, so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but when you have an initial state that's a combination of energy eigenstates, the time evolution leads to oscillations in expectation values with a frequency equal to the energy difference divided by \u0127. So the frequency omega is (E_2 - E_1)/\u0127. So in this case, E_2 is E_+ and E_1 is E_-, so (E_+ - E_-) = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) ) = -gamma B \u0127. The magnitude is gamma B \u0127. So omega = gamma B \u0127 / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option B is gamma B. So that would be the answer. But wait, the question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment. Let me think about that.\n\nThe magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. So the z-component of the moment is gamma S_z. The average of S_z oscillates, so the average of mu_z is gamma times the average of S_z. But when computing the oscillation frequency, the gamma is a factor, so the frequency of S_z is gamma B, and the frequency of mu_z would be the same, because it's just multiplied by a constant.\n\nWait, but wait. The oscillation frequency in the time dependence of the expectation value comes from the energy differences. So yes, the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, another thought. When the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, the system's state will precess around the Y-axis. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally with a frequency determined by the energy splitting. So in terms of the Rabi frequency, which is omega = (E_+ - E_-)/\u0127. As we found earlier, that's gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when the magnetic field is along Y, the spin is precessing around Y. So the expectation value of S_z would vary sinusoidally. The frequency should be related to the energy difference. So I think my earlier conclusion stands.\n\nSo the answer should be option B: gamma B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is about a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The average z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating, and we need to find the oscillation frequency.\n\nHmm. Spin-1/2 particles... I remember they have spin angular momentum, and when placed in a magnetic field, their magnetic moment interacts with the field. The magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * S, right? Or wait, wait. Oh, wait, the question says mu = gamma * Sz. So it's specifically the z-component of spin? Or is it the entire spin? Hmm, that might be important.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think. The magnetic moment for a spin is usually mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin vector. But in this case, the problem states mu = gamma * Sz. That's interesting. So maybe mu is just the component along z? Or perhaps it's a different setup. Maybe the particle's magnetic moment is only in the z-direction initially, but when the magnetic field changes direction, the interaction changes.\n\nWait, but the initial magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's magnetic moment would align with that. When the field is turned off, the spin isn't influenced anymore\u2014so it should stay in its state, right? But then the field is turned on along Y. So the system now has a magnetic field in Y. So the magnetic moment is now interacting with this new field.\n\nWait, but the problem says mu = gamma * Sz. So perhaps the magnetic moment is proportional only to the z-component of spin. Hmm, but when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian would involve the spin in the Y direction. But the magnetic moment is based on Sz, so maybe the Hamiltonian is different.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the setup. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field via the Zeeman term. The energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, then the energy becomes proportional to S_y.\n\nBut in our case, mu is given as gamma * Sz. So substituting that into the energy, the energy would be - (gamma Sz) \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, then Sz \u00b7 B is zero because Sz is along Z and B is along Y. Wait, that would imply the energy is zero, which can't be right. Because that would mean no interaction, but the question says the average z-component oscillates. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the magnetic moment is the vector (mu_x, mu_y, mu_z) = gamma (S_x, S_y, S_z). But the question says mu = gamma Sz. Oh, wait, maybe the magnetic moment is only the z-component, mu_z = gamma S_z. But that would imply that in the presence of a magnetic field along Y, the interaction is mu \u00b7 B = gamma S_z * B_y. But S_z and B_y are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. So no interaction? That can't be right either, because the average z-component would then not oscillate. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe the magnetic moment is the entire vector, mu = gamma * S, so mu_x = gamma S_x, etc. Then the interaction energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So when B is along Y, the energy is proportional to -gamma S_y B.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is when B was along Z. So the system was in an eigenstate of S_z. Then when the field is turned off, the spin state remains the same. But when the field is turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. So the system's state will evolve under this new Hamiltonian.\n\nAh, so the problem is about the transition from a state that's an eigenstate of S_z to a new Hamiltonian involving S_y. This would cause the expectation value of S_z to oscillate over time.\n\nSo the system's time evolution is determined by the new Hamiltonian. The initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's consider the spin-1/2 case. The eigenstates of S_z are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2. But when the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, the energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_y.\n\nSo, the initial state is, say, |+z> (or |-z>). The new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, let me be precise. The interaction energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So mu is gamma S, and B is along Y, so mu \u00b7 B = gamma S \u00b7 (B_y direction) = gamma B S_y. So H = -mu \u00b7 B = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but in terms of units, the Hamiltonian should have units of energy. So H = -gamma B S_y. But S_y has units of angular momentum (like \u0127), so gamma must have units that make this product energy. Okay.\n\nSo the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Alternatively, H can be written as proportional to S_y. Let me think about the energy levels. For a spin-1/2 particle, S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the energies would be E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = -gamma B \u0127. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, E_+ is -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- is gamma B (\u0127/2). So the difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127. So the energy difference is gamma B \u0127.\n\nWait, but the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So frequency omega = (E_2 - E_1)/\u0127. So (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B. Hmm, but wait, I might have gotten the signs wrong. Let me double-check.\n\nH = -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (\u0127/2) for |+y> and E = gamma B (\u0127/2) for |-y>? Or wait, no, the eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the time evolution operator. The initial state is |+z> or |-z>, and under H = -gamma B S_y, the time evolution will cause the state to precess.\n\nThe time evolution of an initial state |psi(0)> under H is given by |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |psi(0)>.\n\nSo the state will evolve into a superposition of the energy eigenstates, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nWe are to find the oscillation frequency of the expectation value of S_z. So let's compute <S_z> as a function of time.\n\nLet me model this. Let's take the initial state as |+z> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) in some basis, but perhaps it's easier to write it in the eigenbasis of S_z.\n\nWait, |+z> is the state where S_z is \u0127/2, so it's (1, 0) in the Sz basis. The Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. Let me write H in matrix form.\n\nIn the Sz basis (|+z>, |-z>), S_y is represented as (\u0127/2) times the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So H = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So H is a 2x2 matrix with elements [[0, -i gamma B \u0127/2], [i gamma B \u0127/2, 0]].\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). Let's compute this.\n\nH has eigenvalues \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2), because the eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2, multiplied by -gamma B (\u0127/2) in H. Wait, let me compute H's eigenvalues. H is proportional to S_y, so H = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * S_y. So the eigenvalues of H would be -gamma B (\u0127/2) times the eigenvalues of S_y, which are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (\u0127/2) = -gamma B \u0127^2/4? Wait, no, wait. Wait, S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So H would have eigenvalues -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (\u00b1 \u0127/2) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So H = -gamma B * S_y. So the eigenvalues of H would be -gamma B * (\u00b1 \u0127/2) = \u00b1 (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) ? No, wait, no. H is H = -gamma B * S_y. So if S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, then H has eigenvalues -gamma B * (\u00b1 \u0127/2) = \u2213 gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me think again. Let me write H = -gamma B * (S_y). So if S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, then H |+y> = -gamma B * (\u0127/2) |+y>. Similarly, H |-y> = gamma B * (\u0127/2) |-y> ?\n\nWait, no. S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = -gamma B (S_y) |+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y>. Similarly, H |-y> = -gamma B (S_y) |-y> = gamma B (\u0127/2) |-y> because S_y |-y> = (-\u0127/2) |-y>. So the eigenvalues of H are E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nSo the energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = gamma B (\u0127/2) - (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is this energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So frequency omega = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B. Hmm, so the frequency is gamma B. But wait, looking at the options, option B is gamma B. But wait, another possibility is that I made a mistake in the sign. Let me think again.\n\nWait, but the initial state is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of H. So the state will evolve in time, and the expectation value of S_z will oscillate. The time dependence will involve terms like e^{-i (E_+ - E_-) t / \u0127}.\n\nWait, the general formula for the expectation value of an observable that's not in the energy basis will involve terms with the difference in energies. So the oscillation frequency is (E_2 - E_1)/\u0127. In this case, E_2 is E_+ and E_1 is E_-? Or the other way around.\n\nWait, the energy difference is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) ) = -gamma B \u0127. So the absolute value is gamma B \u0127, so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but when you have an initial state that's a combination of energy eigenstates, the time evolution leads to oscillations in expectation values with a frequency equal to the energy difference divided by \u0127. So the frequency omega is (E_2 - E_1)/\u0127. So in this case, E_2 is E_+ and E_1 is E_-, so (E_+ - E_-) = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) ) = -gamma B \u0127. The magnitude is gamma B \u0127. So omega = gamma B \u0127 / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option B is gamma B. So that would be the answer. But wait, the question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment. Let me think about that.\n\nThe magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z.

The expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally with a frequency determined by the energy splitting. So in terms of the Rabi frequency, which is omega = (E_+ - E_-)/\u0127.

So the expectation value of S_z would vary sinusoidally. The frequency should be related to the energy difference.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, spin-1/2 particles are like electrons or something similar, right? They have intrinsic angular momentum. The question says the magnetic moment is mu equals gamma times S_z. So mu is proportional to the z-component of the spin.\n\nThe setup is that the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The magnetic moment mu is aligned, so the particle's spin is along Z. Then, the field is switched to Y. I'm trying to think about what happens to the spin state when the magnetic field changes direction.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian changes, the system's state might no longer be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe initial state is probably an eigenstate of S_z. Since the field was along Z, the energy levels are determined by the interaction with B_z. The energy is given by E = -mu \u00b7 B. Since mu is gamma S_z, E = -gamma S_z B. For a spin-1/2 particle, S_z is \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the initial state is either spin-up or spin-down along Z.\n\nAfter the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian will involve S_y. The magnetic moment will interact with the new B_y. So the new Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. Let me write that out.\n\nH = -mu \u00b7 B_new. Since B is along Y, H = -gamma S_y B.\n\nWait, but the direction of the magnetic field determines the direction of the magnetic moment. So the interaction energy is H = - mu \u00b7 B. Since mu is gamma S_z, but wait no, mu is given as gamma times S_z. Wait, no. Wait, wait. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, but is that the vector or just the component? Oh wait, the problem says mu equals gamma times S_z. So mu is a vector in the z-direction. So initially, mu is along Z.\n\nWait, but when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So H is - gamma S_z B. Because mu is gamma S_z, and B is along Y (so B is (0, B, 0)), then the dot product is mu_z * B_z? Wait, no, B is along Y, so B has components (0, B, 0). So mu is (mu_z, 0, 0), since mu is along Z. So mu \u00b7 B would be zero? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the spin. The magnetic moment mu is proportional to the spin. So when the magnetic field is along Z, the energy is proportional to S_z. But when the field is along Y, the energy becomes proportional to S_y.\n\nAh, right, because the Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S \u00b7 n, where n is the direction of the field. So when the field is along Y, H = gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, mu is given as gamma S_z. So perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me clarify:\n\nThe magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma S_z. So initially, the magnetic field is along Z, so the energy is H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B_initial = - gamma S_z B.\n\nBut when the field is turned off and another along Y is turned on, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = - mu \u00b7 B_new = - gamma S_z * 0 (since B_new is along Y, which has zero z-component) plus ... wait, no. Because B_new is along Y, which has components (0, B, 0). So mu \u00b7 B_new is (gamma S_z) * B_y direction? Wait, no, the dot product would be mu_x B_x + mu_y B_y + mu_z B_z. But mu is only in the z-direction, so mu_x and mu_y are zero. Therefore, mu \u00b7 B_new is zero. That can't be right, because then the Hamiltonian would be zero, and there would be no oscillations. But the question states that the average z-component oscillates, so the Hamiltonian must have some effect on S_z over time.\n\nHmm, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem states: mu equals gamma * S_z. So mu is a vector that's only in the z-direction. The initial magnetic field is along +Z, so the interaction is H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B_initial. But when the field is turned off and a new field is applied along Y, the new H is H_new = - mu \u00b7 B_new. But since mu is along Z and B_new is along Y, the dot product is zero. So H_new is zero. That can't be correct because the average would not oscillate. So perhaps I have the wrong expression for the magnetic moment.\n\nWait, maybe mu is the magnitude, and the direction is along the spin. Or perhaps the magnetic moment is proportional to the entire spin vector, not just S_z. Oh wait, the problem says mu equals gamma * S_z. So mu is a vector in the z-direction, regardless of the spin direction. That seems odd. Because normally, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin vector. So mu = gamma S, not just S_z.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe mu is the magnitude of the magnetic moment, which is gamma times the spin's magnitude. But spin is a vector, so S_z is the z-component. Hmm, perhaps the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S, the vector. Then, when the field is along Z, the energy is H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B_initial = - gamma B S_z.\n\nBut when the field is turned to Y, the new Hamiltonian would be H_new = - mu \u00b7 B_new = - gamma B S_y. Because now the B is along Y, so B is (0, B, 0), and mu is gamma S, which is (gamma S_x, gamma S_y, gamma S_z). So the dot product is gamma (S_x * 0 + S_y * B + S_z * 0) = gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but the problem states mu = gamma S_z, which is a vector in the z-direction. So perhaps the magnetic moment is not a vector but just a scalar multiple of S_z. That would mean mu is a vector along z, so when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction would be zero. But then the system's energy doesn't depend on spin anymore, so the state doesn't change, which contradicts the question's premise.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should think differently. Let's consider that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. So mu is a vector in the same direction as S. Then, the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B_initial = - gamma B S_z. The eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies proportional to \u00b1 gamma B.\n\nWhen the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = - mu \u00b7 B_new = - gamma B S_y. So now, the eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nThe initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial, say |+z>. When H changes to H_new, the state is no longer an eigenstate. Therefore, the system will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in observables.\n\nThe observable in question is the average z-component of the particle's moment. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the z-component is gamma <S_z>. So we need to find the expectation value <S_z> as a function of time.\n\nThe time evolution under H_new is determined by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The time evolution operator is exp(-i H_new t / \u0127). H_new is proportional to S_y, which has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. Let's set gamma B = omega_0 for simplicity. Then H_new = - omega_0 S_y.\n\nWait, S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the energy levels are E_+ = - omega_0 (\u0127/2), E_- = omega_0 (\u0127/2). The initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y> states.\n\nThe state |+z> can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>. Let's find the coefficients. The |+y> state is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). So |+z> is [|+y> + |-y>]/sqrt(2). So the coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) each.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: the eigenstates of S_y are |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). So to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>, I can write:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo when the Hamiltonian changes, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe time evolution under H_new is given by each eigenstate evolving with its phase. So the state at time t is:\n\npsi(t) = (|+y> exp(-i E_+ t / \u0127) + |-y> exp(-i E_- t / \u0127)) / sqrt(2).\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-, which are E_+ = - omega_0 (\u0127/2), E_- = omega_0 (\u0127/2). So:\n\npsi(t) = [ |+y> exp(i omega_0 t / 2) + |-y> exp(-i omega_0 t / 2) ] / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nLet me compute this. S_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) (|+y> ), and similarly for |-y>. Wait, no. S_z acting on |+y> isn't straightforward because |+y> is a superposition of |+z> and |-z>. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> in the state psi(t). Let me write psi(t) as:\n\npsi(t) = [ e^{i omega_0 t/2} |+y> + e^{-i omega_0 t/2} |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, S_z can be written in terms of |+y> and |-y>. Because |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of S_y, not S_z. So S_z in the basis of |+y> and |-y> would have matrix elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express everything in the z-basis.\n\nWait, another approach: the expectation value of S_z in the state psi(t) can be found by expanding psi(t) in the z basis and computing the expectation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the time evolution and expanding in terms of energy eigenstates.\n\nWait, since the initial state is a combination of |+y> and |-y>, which are the eigenstates of H_new, the time evolution introduces phase factors. So the expectation value of S_z would involve terms like <+y| S_z |+y>, which is (\u0127/2), but wait, no, because |+y> is a superposition of |+z> and |-z>, so when you compute S_z in that basis, it's a matrix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value using the time-dependent state.\n\nLet me consider the state psi(t) as:\n\npsi(t) = [ e^{i (E_+ t)/\u0127} |+y> + e^{i (E_- t)/\u0127} |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but E_+ is - omega_0 (\u0127/2), so (E_+ t)/\u0127 = - omega_0 t/2. Similarly for E_-.\n\nSo substituting:\n\npsi(t) = [ e^{-i omega_0 t/2} |+y> + e^{i omega_0 t/2} |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, to find <S_z>, I need to compute <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, express S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z> and compute the expectation.\n\nWait, let me write |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSubstituting into psi(t):\n\npsi(t) = [ e^{-i omega_0 t/2} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{i omega_0 t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2).\n\nSimplify this:\n\npsi(t) = [ e^{-i omega_0 t/2} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{i omega_0 t/2} (|+z> - |-z>) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)).\n\nsqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so denominator is 2.\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n= [ (e^{-i theta} + e^{i theta}) |+z> + (e^{-i theta} - e^{i theta}) |-z> ] / 2,\n\nwhere theta is omega_0 t/2.\n\nSo,\n\npsi(t) = [ (2 cos theta) |+z> + (-2i sin theta) |-z> ] / 2\n\n= cos theta |+z> - i sin theta |-z>.\n\nSo the state is |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - i sin(theta) |-z>, where theta = omega_0 t/2.\n\nNow, compute <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nS_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, S_z |-z> = (-\u0127/2) |-z>.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = [ cos(theta) < +z | - i sin(theta) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> - i sin(theta) |-z> ]\n\nMultiply it out:\n\n= cos(theta) cos(theta) < +z | S_z | +z > \n+ cos(theta) (-i sin(theta)) < +z | S_z | -z > \n+ (-i sin(theta)) cos(theta) < -z | S_z | +z > \n+ (-i sin(theta)) (-i sin(theta)) < -z | S_z | -z >.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2(theta) * (\u0127/2).\n\nSecond term: -i cos(theta) sin(theta) < +z | S_z | -z >. But < +z | S_z | -z > is zero because S_z | -z > is -\u0127/2 | -z >, and the inner product with |+z> is zero.\n\nThird term: -i sin(theta) cos(theta) < -z | S_z | +z >. Also zero for the same reason.\n\nFourth term: (-i)^2 sin\u00b2(theta) < -z | S_z | -z >. (-i)^2 is (-i)*(-i) = i\u00b2 = -1. So this term is (-1) sin\u00b2(theta) * (-\u0127/2) = (sin\u00b2(theta))(\u0127/2).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n< S_z > = (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2(theta) + sin\u00b2(theta) ].\n\nBecause the first term is (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2(theta) and the fourth term is (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(theta), and the other terms vanish.\n\nSo cos\u00b2(theta) + sin\u00b2(theta) = 1, so < S_z > = \u0127/2 * 1 = \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if the average S_z is constant, then the average mu_z would be gamma times that, which would also be constant. But the problem states that the average z-component starts oscillating, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nHmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for the state. Let me re-examine the expansion.\n\nWait, earlier I had psi(t) = [ e^{-i theta} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{i theta} (|+z> - |-z>) ] / 2.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\ne^{-i theta} |+z> + e^{-i theta} |-z> + e^{i theta} |+z> - e^{i theta} |-z>.\n\nGrouping terms:\n\n[ e^{-i theta} + e^{i theta} ] |+z> + [ e^{-i theta} - e^{i theta} ] |-z>.\n\nWhich is 2 cos(theta) |+z> + 2i sin(theta) |-z> (because e^{-i theta} - e^{i theta} = -2i sin(theta)).\n\nWait, no: e^{-i theta} - e^{i theta} = -2i sin(theta). So the |-z> term is [ e^{-i theta} - e^{i theta} ] = -2i sin(theta).\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n[ 2 cos(theta) |+z> - 2i sin(theta) |-z> ] / 2.\n\nWhich simplifies to cos(theta) |+z> - i sin(theta) |-z>.\n\nAh, right. So then when calculating < S_z >, the state is psi(t) = cos(theta)|+z> - i sin(theta)|-z>.\n\nSo when I compute < S_z >, which is the expectation of S_z, which is (\u0127/2) for |+z> and (-\u0127/2) for |-z>.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = [ cos(theta) ]^2 (\u0127/2) + [ (-i sin(theta)) ]^2 ( - \u0127/2 ).\n\nWait, because |+z> gives \u0127/2, and |-z> gives -\u0127/2.\n\nWait, no. The expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = |cos(theta)|^2 * (\u0127/2) + | -i sin(theta) |^2 * (- \u0127/2).\n\nWait, the coefficients are cos(theta) and -i sin(theta). The magnitude squared of each coefficient is |cos(theta)|^2 and | -i sin(theta) |^2, which are both cos^2(theta) and sin^2(theta), since |i|=1.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = cos^2(theta) * (\u0127/2) + sin^2(theta) * (- \u0127/2).\n\nWhich simplifies to (\u0127/2)( cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ) = (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta).\n\nBecause cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) is cos(2 theta).\n\nSo the expectation value < S_z > oscillates as cos(2 theta), where theta is omega_0 t/2.\n\nSo theta = (gamma B t/2) * (something?), wait.\n\nWait, earlier I set omega_0 = gamma B. Because H_new = - gamma B S_y, and S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe frequency of oscillation in expectation values is related to the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So the oscillation frequency is (E_- - E_+)/\u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWait, but in our expression for < S_z >, we have cos(2 theta), where theta = (gamma B t/2). So 2 theta = gamma B t. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, the period is T = 2 pi / (gamma B), so the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi), but the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut in our calculation, < S_z > oscillates with frequency gamma B. Because the argument inside the cosine is (gamma B) t.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nThe time dependence in < S_z > is cos(2 theta) where theta = (omega_0) t / 2.\n\nWait, earlier, I set omega_0 = gamma B. So theta = (gamma B) t / 2.\n\nSo 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nSo cos(2 theta) = cos(gamma B t).\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option B is gamma B, option D is gamma B / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait. The oscillation is in the average z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z = gamma < S_z >.\n\nSo the average mu_z would be gamma times < S_z >, which is gamma (\u0127/2 cos(2 theta)).\n\nWait, no, because < S_z > is (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta), so mu_z is gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta).\n\nBut the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment (mu_z). So the frequency is the same as the frequency of cos(2 theta), which is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, in the calculation, the oscillation is in < S_z > with frequency gamma B. Because 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nBut wait, 2 theta = gamma B t, so the argument of the cosine is (gamma B) t. So the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Another approach: the energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B) (\u0127/2), E_- = (gamma B) (\u0127/2). The energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127. The transition frequency between states is (E_- - E_+)/\u0127 = gamma B.\n\nBut in the expectation value of S_z, the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference, which is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, in our earlier calculation, < S_z > oscillates as cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, the time dependence is cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency (cycles per second) is gamma B / (2 pi), but the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is the angular frequency. So the answer is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, wait. The problem says the average of the z-component starts oscillating. But in our calculation, the average oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the correct answer should be option B.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Let me think about the Rabi oscillation. When a two-level system is subjected to an oscillating field, the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy splitting. In this case, the energy splitting is gamma B \u0127. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, spin-1/2 particles are like electrons or something similar, right? They have intrinsic angular momentum. The question says the magnetic moment is mu equals gamma times S_z. So mu is proportional to the z-component of the spin.\n\nThe setup is that the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The magnetic moment mu is aligned, so the particle's spin is along Z. Then, the field is switched to Y. I'm trying to think about what happens to the spin state when the magnetic field changes direction.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian changes, the system's state might no longer be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe initial state is probably an eigenstate of S_z. Since the field was along Z, the energy levels are determined by the interaction with B_z. The energy is given by E = -mu \u00b7 B. Since mu is gamma S_z, E = -gamma S_z B. For a spin-1/2 particle, S_z is \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the initial state is either spin-up or spin-down along Z.\n\nAfter the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian will involve S_y. The magnetic moment will interact with the new B_y. So the new Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. Let me write that out.\n\nH = -mu \u00b7 B_new. Since B is along Y, H = -gamma S_y B.\n\nWait, but the direction of the magnetic field determines the direction of the magnetic moment. So the interaction energy is H = - mu \u00b7 B. Since mu is gamma S_z, but wait no, mu is given as gamma times S_z. Wait, no. Wait, wait. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, but is that the vector or just the component? Oh wait, the problem says mu equals gamma times S_z. So mu is a vector in the z-direction. So initially, mu is along Z.\n\nWait, but when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So H is - gamma S_z B. Because mu is gamma S_z, and B is along Y (so B is (0, B, 0)), then the dot product is mu_z * B_z? Wait, no, B is along Y, so B has components (0, B, 0). So mu is (mu_z, 0, 0), since mu is along Z. So mu \u00b7 B would be zero? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the spin. The magnetic moment mu is proportional to the spin. So when the magnetic field is along Z, the energy is proportional to S_z. But when the field is along Y, the energy becomes proportional to S_y.\n\nAh, right, because the Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S \u00b7 n, where n is the direction of the field. So when the field is along Y, H = gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, mu is given as gamma S_z. So perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me clarify:\n\nThe magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma S_z. So initially, the magnetic field is along Z, so the energy is H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B_initial = - gamma S_z B.\n\nBut when the field is turned off and another along Y is turned on, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = - mu \u00b7 B_new = - gamma S_z * 0 (since B_new is along Y, which has zero z-component) plus ... wait, no. Because B_new is along Y, which has components (0, B, 0). So mu \u00b7 B_new is (gamma S_z) * B_y direction? Wait, no, the dot product would be mu_x B_x + mu_y B_y + mu_z B_z. But mu is only in the z-direction, so mu_x and mu_y are zero. Therefore, mu \u00b7 B_new is zero. That can't be right, because then the Hamiltonian would be zero, and there would be no oscillations. But the question states that the average z-component oscillates, so the Hamiltonian must have some effect on S_z over time.\n\nHmm, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem states: mu equals gamma * S_z. So mu is a vector that's only in the z-direction. The initial magnetic field is along +Z, so the interaction is H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B_initial. But when the field is turned off and a new field is applied along Y, the new H is H_new = - mu \u00b7 B_new. But since mu is along Z and B_new is along Y, the dot product is zero. So H_new is zero. That can't be correct because the average would not oscillate. So perhaps I have the wrong expression for the magnetic moment.\n\nWait, maybe mu is the magnitude, and the direction is along the spin. Or perhaps the magnetic moment is proportional to the entire spin vector, not just S_z. Oh wait, the problem says mu equals gamma * S_z. So mu is a vector in the z-direction, regardless of the spin direction. That seems odd. Because normally, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin vector. So mu = gamma S, not just S_z.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe mu is the magnitude of the magnetic moment, which is gamma times the spin's magnitude. But spin is a vector, so S_z is the z-component. Hmm, perhaps the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S, the vector. Then, when the field is along Z, the energy is H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B_initial = - gamma B S_z.\n\nBut when the field is turned to Y, the new Hamiltonian would be H_new = - mu \u00b7 B_new = - gamma B S_y. Because now the B is along Y, so B is (0, B, 0), and mu is gamma S, which is (gamma S_x, gamma S_y, gamma S_z). So the dot product is gamma (S_x * 0 + S_y * B + S_z * 0) = gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but the problem states mu = gamma S_z, which is a vector in the z-direction. So perhaps the magnetic moment is not a vector but just a scalar multiple of S_z. That would mean mu is a vector along z, so when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction would be zero. But then the system's energy doesn't depend on spin anymore, so the state doesn't change, which contradicts the question's premise.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should think differently. Let's consider that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. So mu is a vector in the same direction as S. Then, the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B_initial = - gamma B S_z. The eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies proportional to \u00b1 gamma B.\n\nWhen the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = - mu \u00b7 B_new = - gamma B S_y. So now, the eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nThe initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial, say |+z>. When H changes to H_new, the state is no longer an eigenstate. Therefore, the system will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in observables.\n\nThe observable in question is the average z-component of the particle's moment. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the z-component is gamma <S_z>. So we need to find the expectation value <S_z> as a function of time.\n\nThe time evolution under H_new is determined by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The time evolution operator is exp(-i H_new t / \u0127). H_new is proportional to S_y, which has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. Let's set gamma B = omega_0 for simplicity. Then H_new = - omega_0 S_y.\n\nWait, S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the energy levels are E_+ = - omega_0 (\u0127/2), E_- = omega_0 (\u0127/2). The initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y> states.\n\nThe state |+z> can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>. Let's find the coefficients. The |+y> state is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). So |+z> is [|+y> + |-y>]/sqrt(2). So the coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) each.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: the eigenstates of S_y are |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). So to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>, I can write:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo when the Hamiltonian changes, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe time evolution under H_new is given by each eigenstate evolving with its phase. So the state at time t is:\n\npsi(t) = (|+y> exp(-i E_+ t / \u0127) + |-y> exp(-i E_- t / \u0127)) / sqrt(2).\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-, which are E_+ = - omega_0 (\u0127/2), E_- = omega_0 (\u0127/2). So:\n\npsi(t) = [ |+y> exp(i omega_0 t / 2) + |-y> exp(-i omega_0 t / 2) ] / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nLet me compute this. S_z |+y> = (\u0127/2) (|+y> ), and similarly for |-y>. Wait, no. S_z acting on |+y> isn't straightforward because |+y> is a superposition of |+z> and |-z>. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> in the state psi(t). Let me write psi(t) as:\n\npsi(t) = [ e^{i omega_0 t/2} |+y> + e^{-i omega_0 t/2} |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, S_z can be written in terms of |+y> and |-y>. Because |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of S_y, not S_z. So S_z in the basis of |+y> and |-y> would have matrix elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express everything in the z-basis.\n\nWait, another approach: the expectation value of S_z in the state psi(t) can be found by expanding psi(t) in the z basis and computing the expectation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the time evolution and expanding in terms of energy eigenstates.\n\nWait, since the initial state is a combination of |+y> and |-y>, which are the eigenstates of H_new, the time evolution introduces phase factors. So the expectation value of S_z would involve terms like <+y| S_z |+y>, which is (\u0127/2), but wait, no, because |+y> is a superposition of |+z> and |-z>, so when you compute S_z in that basis, it's a matrix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value using the time-dependent state.\n\nLet me consider the state psi(t) as:\n\npsi(t) = [ e^{i (E_+ t)/\u0127} |+y> + e^{i (E_- t)/\u0127} |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but E_+ is - omega_0 (\u0127/2), so (E_+ t)/\u0127 = - omega_0 t/2. Similarly for E_-.\n\nSo substituting:\n\npsi(t) = [ e^{-i omega_0 t/2} |+y> + e^{i omega_0 t/2} |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, to find <S_z>, I need to compute <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, express S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z> and compute the expectation.\n\nWait, let me write |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSubstituting into psi(t):\n\npsi(t) = [ e^{-i omega_0 t/2} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{i omega_0 t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2).\n\nSimplify this:\n\npsi(t) = [ e^{-i omega_0 t/2} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{i omega_0 t/2} (|+z> - |-z>) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)).\n\nsqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so denominator is 2.\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n= [ (e^{-i theta} + e^{i theta}) |+z> + (e^{-i theta} - e^{i theta}) |-z> ] / 2,\n\nwhere theta is omega_0 t/2.\n\nSo,\n\npsi(t) = [ (2 cos theta) |+z> + (-2i sin theta) |-z> ] / 2\n\n= cos theta |+z> - i sin theta |-z>.\n\nSo the state is |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - i sin(theta) |-z>, where theta = omega_0 t/2.\n\nNow, compute <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nS_z |+z> = (\u0127/2) |+z>, S_z |-z> = (-\u0127/2) |-z>.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = [ cos(theta) < +z | - i sin(theta) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> - i sin(theta) |-z> ]\n\nMultiply it out:\n\n= cos(theta) cos(theta) < +z | S_z | +z > \n+ cos(theta) (-i sin(theta)) < +z | S_z | -z > \n+ (-i sin(theta)) cos(theta) < -z | S_z | +z > \n+ (-i sin(theta)) (-i sin(theta)) < -z | S_z | -z >.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2(theta) * (\u0127/2).\n\nSecond term: -i cos(theta) sin(theta) < +z | S_z | -z >. But < +z | S_z | -z > is zero because S_z | -z > is -\u0127/2 | -z >, and the inner product with |+z> is zero.\n\nThird term: -i sin(theta) cos(theta) < -z | S_z | +z >. Also zero for the same reason.\n\nFourth term: (-i)^2 sin\u00b2(theta) < -z | S_z | -z >. (-i)^2 is (-i)*(-i) = i\u00b2 = -1. So this term is (-1) sin\u00b2(theta) * (-\u0127/2) = (sin\u00b2(theta))(\u0127/2).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n< S_z > = (\u0127/2) [ cos\u00b2(theta) + sin\u00b2(theta) ].\n\nBecause the first term is (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2(theta) and the fourth term is (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(theta), and the other terms vanish.\n\nSo cos\u00b2(theta) + sin\u00b2(theta) = 1, so < S_z > = \u0127/2 * 1 = \u0127/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if the average S_z is constant, then the average mu_z would be gamma times that, which would also be constant. But the problem states that the average z-component starts oscillating, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nHmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for the state. Let me re-examine the expansion.\n\nWait, earlier I had psi(t) = [ e^{-i theta} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{i theta} (|+z> - |-z>) ] / 2.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\ne^{-i theta} |+z> + e^{-i theta} |-z> + e^{i theta} |+z> - e^{i theta} |-z>.\n\nGrouping terms:\n\n[ e^{-i theta} + e^{i theta} ] |+z> + [ e^{-i theta} - e^{i theta} ] |-z>.\n\nWhich is 2 cos(theta) |+z> + 2i sin(theta) |-z> (because e^{-i theta} - e^{i theta} = -2i sin(theta)).\n\nWait, no: e^{-i theta} - e^{i theta} = -2i sin(theta). So the |-z> term is [ e^{-i theta} - e^{i theta} ] = -2i sin(theta).\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n[ 2 cos(theta) |+z> - 2i sin(theta) |-z> ] / 2.\n\nWhich simplifies to cos(theta) |+z> - i sin(theta) |-z>.\n\nAh, right. So then when calculating < S_z >, the state is psi(t) = cos(theta)|+z> - i sin(theta)|-z>.\n\nSo when I compute < S_z >, which is the expectation of S_z, which is (\u0127/2) for |+z> and (-\u0127/2) for |-z>.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = [ cos(theta) ]^2 (\u0127/2) + [ (-i sin(theta)) ]^2 ( - \u0127/2 ).\n\nWait, because |+z> gives \u0127/2, and |-z> gives -\u0127/2.\n\nWait, no. The expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = |cos(theta)|^2 * (\u0127/2) + | -i sin(theta) |^2 * (- \u0127/2).\n\nWait, the coefficients are cos(theta) and -i sin(theta). The magnitude squared of each coefficient is |cos(theta)|^2 and | -i sin(theta) |^2, which are both cos^2(theta) and sin^2(theta), since |i|=1.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = cos^2(theta) * (\u0127/2) + sin^2(theta) * (- \u0127/2).\n\nWhich simplifies to (\u0127/2)( cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ) = (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta).\n\nBecause cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) is cos(2 theta).\n\nSo the expectation value < S_z > oscillates as cos(2 theta), where theta is omega_0 t/2.\n\nSo theta = (gamma B t/2) * (something?), wait.\n\nWait, earlier I set omega_0 = gamma B. Because H_new = - gamma B S_y, and S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2). So the energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe frequency of oscillation in expectation values is related to the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So the oscillation frequency is (E_- - E_+)/\u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWait, but in our expression for < S_z >, we have cos(2 theta), where theta = (gamma B t/2). So 2 theta = gamma B t. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, the period is T = 2 pi / (gamma B), so the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi), but the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut in our calculation, < S_z > oscillates with frequency gamma B. Because the argument inside the cosine is (gamma B) t.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nThe time dependence in < S_z > is cos(2 theta) where theta = (omega_0) t / 2.\n\nWait, earlier, I set omega_0 = gamma B. So theta = (gamma B) t / 2.\n\nSo 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nSo cos(2 theta) = cos(gamma B t).\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option B is gamma B, option D is gamma B / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait. The oscillation is in the average z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z = gamma < S_z >.\n\nSo the average mu_z would be gamma times < S_z >, which is gamma (\u0127/2 cos(2 theta)).\n\nWait, no, because < S_z > is (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta), so mu_z is gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta).\n\nBut the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment (mu_z). So the frequency is the same as the frequency of cos(2 theta), which is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, in the calculation, the oscillation is in < S_z > with frequency gamma B. Because 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nBut wait, 2 theta = gamma B t, so the argument of the cosine is (gamma B) t. So the angular frequency is gamma B.\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Another approach: the energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B) (\u0127/2), E_- = (gamma B) (\u0127/2). The energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127. The transition frequency between states is (E_- - E_+)/\u0127 = gamma B.\n\nBut in the expectation value of S_z, the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference, which is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, in our earlier calculation, < S_z > oscillates as cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, the time dependence is cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency (cycles per second) is gamma B / (2 pi), but the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is the angular frequency. So the answer is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, wait. The problem says the average of the z-component starts oscillating. But in our calculation, the average oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the correct answer should be option B.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Let me think about the Rabi oscillation. When a two-level system is subjected to an oscillating field, the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy splitting. In this case, the energy splitting is gamma B \u0127. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should be option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. When the field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian changes, and the system evolves over time. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  \n   Initially, the magnetic field is along $+z$, and the particle's state is an eigenstate of $S_z$. After the field is switched to $+y$, the new Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\\mu \\cdot B = -\\gamma B S_y$. This Hamiltonian governs the time evolution of the system.\n\n2. **Time Evolution**:  \n   The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ is no longer an eigenstate of $H$. It can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of $S_y$, $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, which are:\n   \\[\n   |+y\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+z\\rangle + |-z\\rangle), \\quad |-y\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+z\\rangle - |-z\\rangle).\n   \\]\n   The time evolution of the state introduces phase factors due to the energy eigenvalues of $H$, which are $\\pm \\frac{\\hbar \\gamma B}{2}$.\n\n3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  \n   The expectation value of $S_z$ in the time-evolved state oscillates due to the interference between the eigenstates of $S_y$. After detailed calculation, it is found that:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   This shows that the oscillation frequency of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ is $\\gamma B$.\n\n4. **Oscillation Frequency of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$**:  \n   Since $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$, the oscillation frequency of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ is the same as that of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$, which is $\\gamma B$.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
