      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try.\n\nThe question says that the ejecta and the galaxy are both in inertial frames. So, no acceleration involved here. That probably means I can use classical mechanics or maybe some special relativity. But wait, the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me think about that. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of the speed of light. That's a significant fraction, so relativistic effects might matter. Oh, but the problem says to ignore gravity and rotation, so maybe it's just a straightforward velocity problem.\n\nWait, the problem is about how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, I need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame. But wait, time in different frames is different. Oh right, time dilation! Because the ejecta is moving relative to the galaxy, their time will be different from each other's.\n\nSo, let's recap: in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at that speed. So, the situation is symmetric in that sense. But the time experienced in each frame isn't the same.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate the distance? The galaxy's frame is our frame of interest for the distance. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance would be speed multiplied by time. But wait, the time given is in the ejecta's frame, not the galaxy's. So I can't directly multiply 60,000 by 50, because that's in different time frames.\n\nOh, right. So I need to find the time that passes in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Then, I can multiply that by the speed to get the distance.\n\nBut wait, time dilation depends on the relative velocity. The formula for time dilation is t' = gamma * t, where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Wait, no, actually, t is the time in the galaxy's frame, and t' is the time in the ejecta's frame. Because the galaxy is moving at velocity v relative to the ejecta, but from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at v.\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify the frames. Let me denote the galaxy frame as S and the ejecta frame as S'. So, in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity v. In S', the galaxy is moving at velocity v. So, if an event occurs at time t in S, what is the time t' in S'? Using the Lorentz transformation.\n\nBut the problem states that in S' (ejecta frame), the time is 50 seconds. So, t' =50 s. I need to find t in S (galaxy frame) during which the ejecta travels a certain distance.\n\nWait, but time in S is different from S'. Let me think. The time experienced in S' is shorter if the events are happening in the direction of motion. Wait, no, it's the other way around. If two events happen at the same place in S, then the time between them is longer in S' (moving frame). But in this case, the events are the front and back of the ejecta moving, or perhaps the time elapsed in S' is 50 seconds.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this using the Lorentz factor. The gamma factor is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let me compute that. v is 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that to m/s for calculation, but wait, perhaps I can work in km/s and keep the units consistent.\n\nWait, 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, since c is approximately 300,000 km/s. So v = 0.2c.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.98 \u2248 1.0204. Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute sqrt(0.96). Let me think: sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nNow, time dilation formula: t = gamma * t' ?\n\nWait, no, that's when the events are at the same place in the moving frame. If the events (say, the start and end of the time interval) are at the same place in S' (ejecta frame), then t' is the proper time, and t in S would be longer by gamma.\n\nBut in this problem, the 50 seconds is in the ejecta frame, so t' is 50 s. So the time in the galaxy frame is t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo t = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, is the time in the galaxy frame less than the ejecta frame? No, because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving, so the galaxy's clock runs faster. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the galaxy's clock would have shown more time.\n\nBut wait, in the case of length contraction, perhaps the distance is contracted. Wait, no, the distance in the galaxy frame is the proper length, because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving, so the galaxy's size is contracted.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this from another angle.\n\nThe problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame (S'), the galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance the galaxy travels in S' in 50 seconds is v * t' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km.\n\nBut wait, that's the distance the galaxy moves in the ejecta's frame. But we need the distance the ejecta moves in the galaxy's frame. So, how are these related?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can relate the time in the galaxy's frame to the time in the ejecta's frame, then compute the distance accordingly.\n\nSo, the time in the galaxy frame t is related to t' by the time dilation formula.\n\nBut wait, in S' (ejecta frame), the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta. So, in S' frame, the galaxy is approaching at velocity v, and the time between two events (like the start and end of the 50-second interval) is t' =50 s. So, the distance the galaxy travels is v * t'.\n\nBut in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v. So, the time that has passed in the galaxy's frame is t, and the distance the ejecta has traveled is v * t.\n\nBut how do t and t' relate? Because the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) are happening at different places in the galaxy's frame, perhaps?\n\nWait, perhaps the events are the same in both frames, but viewed from different perspectives. Hmm. Let me think: if in S' (ejecta frame), the galaxy is moving, and the two events (say, the front and back) are at different positions, but in S (galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving, and the events are at different positions as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the velocity addition formula or Lorentz transformations.\n\nLet me consider that in S' (ejecta frame), the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v. So, the galaxy's frame is moving at velocity v in S' (ejecta's frame). So, the galaxy's frame S is moving at velocity -v in S'.\n\nThe time between events in S' is t' =50 s.\n\nI need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S (galaxy's frame), which is v * t, where t is the time in S.\n\nBut how to find t in terms of t'?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the proper time is involved. The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events happen at the same place. In this case, if the two events (say, the start and end of the time interval) are at the same location in S (galaxy frame), then t is the proper time, and t' would be longer. But I don't think that's the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the Lorentz transformation equations. Let's say that in S', the two events are separated by time t' and position x' = 0 (since the events are at the same place in S' frame). Then, the Lorentz transformation to S frame would give t and x.\n\nBut wait, in S', the events are at the same place, so x' =0. The Lorentz transformation is:\n\nt = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 )\n\nBut x' is zero, so t = gamma * t'\n\nSimilarly, x = gamma (x' + v t') = gamma * v t'\n\nWait, so in S (galaxy frame), the position x is gamma * v t'\n\nWait, but that would be the position of the event in S. Wait, but what's the scenario here? If in S' (ejecta frame), the galaxy is moving, and the two events (start and end of time) occur at the same point (x'=0), then in S (galaxy frame), the position would be x = gamma * v t'\n\nSo, the distance the galaxy moves in S' is v t' (3 million km), but in S, the distance the ejecta moves is v t, where t = gamma t'. So that would be v gamma t'.\n\nSo, putting it together, the distance in S is v * gamma * t'.\n\nWait, because t = gamma t', so distance is v t = v gamma t'.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nv is 60,000 km/s.\n\nt' is 50 s.\n\nGamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nSo, v * gamma * t' = 60,000 km/s * 1.0206 * 50 s.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000. Then multiply by 1.0206: 3,000,000 * 1.0206 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, that's about 3,061,800 km. Let me check the options.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm, 3,061,800 is closest to D) 3,060,000 km. So the answer would be D.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact value of gamma. Let me compute 1 / sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\n0.96 is 24/25. So sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5. Sqrt(24) is approximately 4.89898. So sqrt(0.96) is about 0.9798.\n\nSo 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.02062.\n\nSo, 60,000 * 50 =3,000,000. Multiply by 1.02062: 3,000,000 *1.02062=3,061,860 km.\n\nSo approximately 3,061,860 km. The options have D as 3,060,000 km, which is very close. So the correct answer would be D.\n\nWait, but wait another point. Alternatively, perhaps the time experienced in the galaxy frame is less than the ejecta's frame. No, no, the galaxy frame is the rest frame, so the ejecta is moving. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the galaxy's clock shows longer than 50 seconds.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier calculation, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 \u224851.03 s. So the ejecta has been moving for 51.03 seconds in the galaxy's frame. So the distance is 60,000 *51.03 \u22483,061,800 km.\n\nWhich again is about 3,060,000, so D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction. Since the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy, the distance would be positive in that direction, but that shouldn't affect the calculation.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me think. The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, so the key here is probably about relative velocity and time dilation, right? Because the frames are moving relative to each other, so time might not be the same in both frames. Oh wait, but since both are inertial, maybe I can use the Lorentz transformation or something related to special relativity.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's define the two reference frames. Let's say S is the Galaxy's frame, and S' is the ejecta's frame. So in S', the center of the Galaxy (origin) is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but the ejecta is moving towards the center in S. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is v, and in S', the Galaxy's center is moving at velocity u.\n\nWait, I think I should figure out the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame. But wait, the problem says from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that would mean that in the ejecta's frame S', the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s. So the relative velocity between S and S' is 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, no, actually, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. So if the ejecta is moving at velocity u in the Galaxy's frame (S), then from the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving at velocity -u (since the frames are moving in opposite directions). But the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that would imply that u is 60,000 km/s, but wait, that can't be right because the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of c. So u is 0.2c, but wait, wait, 60,000 km/s is 0.06c? Wait no, 3e5 km/s is c. So 6e4 is 0.2c. Yeah, 60,000 is 0.2 times 300,000, so 0.2c.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me restate: The problem says that in the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the velocity of the Galaxy's center as observed from S' is u' = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So in S', the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.\n\nBut from the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards it. So the velocity v of the ejecta in S is 60,000 km/s? Or is that the other way around?\n\nWait, no, in S (Galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving towards the center at v. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is v. So from the S' frame (ejecta), the Galaxy is moving towards it at velocity u. But in relativity, if frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S along the same axis, then the velocity u observed in S' would be u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c\u00b2), but I'm a bit hazy on the exact formula.\n\nWait, let's get the velocity transformation right. The velocity of an object in S is u, then in S' moving at velocity v relative to S (along the x-axis), the velocity u' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c\u00b2) when S' is moving at velocity v relative to S.\n\nWait, in this case, the problem says that in S', the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So the velocity of the Galaxy (which is at rest in S) as observed in S' is u' = -60,000 km/s. Wait, why negative? Because in S, the Galaxy is stationary. So the velocity of the Galaxy in S' is u' = -v, since S' is moving at velocity v relative to S.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let's say in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center (so v is positive in the direction towards the center). Then, the velocity of the Galaxy (which is at rest in S) as observed from S' (the ejecta's frame) would be u' = -v / gamma, or wait, perhaps using the velocity transformation formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think that when the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the Galaxy (in S), then in the ejecta's frame S', the Galaxy is approaching at velocity u'. So u' = v * (1 + v/c\u00b2)/(1 - v/c\u00b2) or something like that. Wait, no, that's the velocity addition formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for relative velocity. So the velocity u' of the Galaxy in S' is given by the velocity addition formula. Since in S, the Galaxy is stationary (u = 0), and the ejecta is moving at v. So the velocity u' observed in S' is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c\u00b2). But u is zero because the Galaxy is at rest in S, so u' = (-v) / (1 - 0) = -v. So u' is -v. But the problem states that in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so u' = 60,000 km/s. That would imply that -v = 60,000, so v = -60,000 km/s. Wait, but velocity can be positive or negative. So if in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at v = 60,000 km/s, then in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at u' = -v (but according to the formula, u' = -v, so if v is positive, u' is negative. But the problem says the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, so u' is positive 60,000. So perhaps I'm getting the signs wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to take the direction into account. Let's define the positive x-axis as the direction from the ejecta to the Galaxy. So in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy (so velocity v is negative). In S' (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta (so velocity u' is positive). So in S, the velocity of the ejecta is v = -60,000 km/s (since it's moving towards the Galaxy). Then, using the velocity addition formula, the velocity of the Galaxy in S' is u' = (u - v')/(1 - (u v')/c\u00b2 ), but wait, I'm getting confused again. Maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in S, the Galaxy is at rest. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at velocity v. So from the ejecta's frame S', the Galaxy is moving towards it at velocity u'. Using the formula for u' in terms of v: u' = (v) / (1 + v/c ), assuming v is positive in the direction from S to S'. Wait, no, perhaps I should set up the problem correctly.\n\nLet me consider that in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the center (so velocity v is negative, say v = -60,000 km/s). Then, in S', the velocity of the Galaxy would be u' = (v - V) / (1 - (v V)/c\u00b2 ), where V is the relative velocity between S and S'. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the frames.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that the velocity in the other frame is u' = (v - V) / (1 - (v V)/(c\u00b2)), where V is the velocity of S' relative to S. Wait, S' is the ejecta's frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to S. So V is the velocity of S' relative to S, which is v_ejecta = v.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong. Let me think again. In S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at velocity v. So the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is v. So the velocity of the Galaxy relative to the ejecta would be -v, but considering relativistic effects.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the ejecta's frame (S') sees the Galaxy moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So u' = 60,000 km/s. So using the velocity addition formula, u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c\u00b2), where u is the velocity of the Galaxy in S (which is zero, since in S the Galaxy is at rest) and v is the velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S. So u' = (0 - v) / (1 - 0) )= -v. But u' is given as 60,000 km/s, so -v = 60,000 km/s. Thus, v = -60,000 km/s. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is v = -60,000 km/s (since positive is away from the Galaxy, negative is towards it).\n\nSo in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = -60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but wait, in the problem statement, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So according to the formula, that would imply that the velocity of the Galaxy in S' is u' = 60,000 km/s. So using the formula u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c\u00b2 ), where u is the Galaxy's velocity in S (which is zero), and v is the velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S (so v is -60,000 km/s, because in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, which is in the negative direction).\n\nSo plugging in u = 0, v = -60,000 km/s, we get u' = (0 - (-60,000)) / (1 - (0 * (-60,000))/c\u00b2 ) = 60,000 / 1 = 60,000 km/s. Which matches the problem statement. So that makes sense.\n\nSo in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at v = -60,000 km/s. Now, the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (S'). We need to find how much distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) during that time.\n\nWait, but how is time related between the two frames? Because time dilation occurs, so the time experienced in S' (t') is different from the time in S (t). So we need to find the relationship between t and t'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the proper time. Let me think.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame (S'), the time elapsed is t' = 50 s. We need to find the corresponding time t in the Galaxy's frame (S), and then calculate the distance the ejecta travels in that time t.\n\nWait, but wait: the ejecta's frame is moving relative to the Galaxy's frame. So the time in S and S' are different. So the time experienced in S' is t', but in S, the time elapsed would be longer due to time dilation.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the events. The event is: the ejecta emits light at t'=0, and then after 50 seconds in its own frame, at t'=50 s, another event occurs (like a photon leaving or something). We need to find the distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during the time between these two events.\n\nSo to find the distance, we can compute the velocity in S multiplied by the time interval in S.\n\nBut first, we need to find the time interval in S, t, that corresponds to t' =50 s.\n\nSo using the Lorentz transformation for time. The time in S is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 ), but in S', the two events happen at the same place (x' =0), because the ejecta doesn't move in its own frame. So x' is 0. Thus, t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 ). Since v is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c.\n\nSo v = 0.2c, so v\u00b2 = 0.04 c\u00b2. So 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96. So gamma is 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nWait, let me compute it accurately. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, so 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s \u2248 51.03 s.\n\nSo in the Galaxy's frame, the time elapsed is approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nNow, the ejecta's velocity in S is v = -60,000 km/s (but wait, no, in our earlier setup, the velocity in S is v = -60,000 km/s, but wait, wait: earlier, we thought that in S, the ejecta's velocity is v = -60,000 km/s, but that's not correct because v was determined from the velocity addition formula. Wait, no, earlier we determined that in S, the ejecta's velocity is v = -60,000 km/s, because u' (Galaxy's velocity in S') is 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. Earlier, using the velocity addition formula, we found that in S, the ejecta's velocity is v = -60,000 km/s. But that would mean that from S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy (negative direction) at 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo the distance the ejecta travels in S during time t is distance = v * t. But wait, v is negative (towards the Galaxy), but distance is scalar, so we take the absolute value. Or perhaps the question is about the distance in terms of displacement, but the problem states \"what distance the ejecta travels\"\u2014so probably the distance is |v| * t.\n\nWait, but the question says \"what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\" So in S, the ejecta is moving at v = -60,000 km/s. The time elapsed in S is t \u224851.03 s. So the distance it travels is |v| * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 km = 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. The options are 2.94e6, 3e6, 2.88e6, 3.06e6.\n\nWait, 3,061,800 km is approximately 3.06e6 km. Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. So that's very close. So the answer would be D.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recalculate gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c. So v\u00b2 = (0.2c)^2 = 0.04 c\u00b2.\n\nSo 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nt = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 = 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 km/s *51.03 s = 60,000 *51.03 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 *50 = 3,000,000. 60,000 *1.03 = 61,800. So total is 3,061,800 km. So that's 3,061,800 km, which is about 3.0618e6 km. The option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the time in S is t = gamma * t'. Wait, no, that's correct because in S', the two events occur at the same place, so x'=0, so the time in S is t = gamma * t'.\n\nBut wait, another approach: maybe using the proper time. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the object. Wait, but the ejecta's frame is S', so the proper time would be t' for events happening in S'. But when considering two events happening at the same place in S', the time between them is the proper time.\n\nWait, but in this case, the events are the start and end of the 50 seconds in S'. So the proper time is t' =50 s. The time in S is t = gamma * t'. So that's the same as before.\n\nWait, but perhaps the distance is v * t, where v is 60,000 km/s and t is the time in S, which is t = gamma *50 s.\n\nSo 60,000 km/s * gamma *50 s = 60,000 * 50 * gamma km.\n\nSo 60,000 *50 =3e6, and 3e6 * gamma (1.0206) =3e6 *1.0206=3,061,800 km.\n\nSo the answer would be approximately 3.06e6 km, which is option D: 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the calculation gives 3,061,800 km, which is 3.0618e6, but option D is 3.06e6. Hmm, perhaps the approximation in gamma is causing this.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\nGamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.02062365.\n\nSo 1.02062365 *50 =51.0311825 s.\n\nThen, 60,000 km/s * 51.0311825 s = 60,000 *51.0311825 = 3,061,870.95 km.\n\nWhich is approximately 3,061,871 km. So when rounded to the nearest 100,000, it would be 3.06e6, which is option D.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D.\n",

Then, the velocity of the Galaxy (which is at rest in S) as observed from S' (the ejecta's frame) would be u' = -v / gamma, or wait, perhaps using the velocity transformation formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think that when the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the Galaxy (in S), then in the ejecta's frame S', the Galaxy is approaching at velocity u'. So u' = v * (1 + v/c\u00b2)/(1 - v/c\u00b2) or something like that. Wait, no, that's the velocity addition formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for relative velocity. So the velocity u' of the Galaxy in S' is given by the velocity addition formula. Since in S, the Galaxy is stationary (u = 0), and the ejecta is moving at v. So the velocity u' observed in S' is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c\u00b2). But u is zero because the Galaxy is at rest in S, so u' = (-v) / (1 - 0) = -v. So u' is -v. But the problem states that in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so u' = 60,000 km/s. That would imply that -v = 60,000, so v = -60,000 km/s. Wait, but velocity can be positive or negative. So if in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at v = 60,000 km/s, then in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at u' = -v (but according to the formula, u' = -v, so if v is positive, u' is negative. But the problem says the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, so u' is positive 60,000. So perhaps I'm getting the signs wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to take the direction into account. Let's define the positive x-axis as the direction from the ejecta to the Galaxy. So in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy (so velocity v is negative). In S' (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta (so velocity u' is positive). So in S, the velocity of the ejecta is v = -60,000 km/s (since it's moving towards the Galaxy). Then, using the velocity addition formula, the velocity of the Galaxy in S' is u' = (u - v')/(1 - (u v')/c\u00b2 ), but wait, I'm getting confused again. Maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in S, the Galaxy is at rest. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at velocity v. So from the ejecta's frame S', the Galaxy is moving towards it at velocity u'. Using the formula for u' in terms of v: u' = (v) / (1 + v/c ), assuming v is positive in the direction from S to S'. Wait, no, perhaps I should set up the problem correctly.\n\nLet me consider that in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the center (so velocity v is negative, say v = -60,000 km/s). Then, in S', the velocity of the Galaxy would be u' = (v - V) / (1 - (v V)/c\u00b2 ), where V is the relative velocity between S and S'. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the frames.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that the velocity in the other frame is u' = (v - V) / (1 - (v V)/(c\u00b2)), where V is the velocity of S' relative to S. Wait, S' is the ejecta's frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to S. So V is the velocity of S' relative to S, which is v_ejecta = v.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong. Let me think again. In S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at velocity v. So the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is v. So the velocity of the Galaxy relative to the ejecta would be -v, but considering relativistic effects.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the ejecta's frame (S') sees the Galaxy moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So u' = 60,000 km/s. So using the velocity addition formula, u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c\u00b2), where u is the velocity of the Galaxy in S (which is zero, since in S the Galaxy is at rest) and v is the velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S. So u' = (0 - v) / (1 - 0) )= -v. But u' is given as 60,000 km/s, so -v = 60,000 km/s. Thus, v = -60,000 km/s. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is v = -60,000 km/s (since positive is away from the Galaxy, negative is towards it).\n\nSo in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = -60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but wait, in the problem statement, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So according to the formula, that would imply that the velocity of the Galaxy in S' is u' = 60,000 km/s. So using the formula u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c\u00b2 ), where u is the Galaxy's velocity in S (which is zero), and v is the velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S (so v is -60,000 km/s, because in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, which is in the negative direction).\n\nSo plugging in u = 0, v = -60,000 km/s, we get u' = (0 - (-60,000)) / (1 - (0 * (-60,000))/c\u00b2 ) = 60,000 / 1 = 60,000 km/s. Which matches the problem statement. So that makes sense.\n\nSo in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at v = -60,000 km/s. Now, the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (S'). We need to find how much distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) during that time.\n\nWait, but how is time related between the two frames? Because time dilation occurs, so the time experienced in S' (t') is different from the time in S (t). So we need to find the relationship between t and t'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the proper time. Let me think.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame (S'), the time elapsed is t' = 50 s. We need to find the corresponding time t in the Galaxy's frame (S), and then calculate the distance the ejecta travels in that time t.\n\nWait, but wait: the ejecta's frame is moving relative to the Galaxy's frame. So the time in S and S' are different. So the time experienced in S' is t', but in S, the time elapsed would be longer due to time dilation.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the events. The event is: the ejecta emits light at t'=0, and then after 50 seconds in its own frame, at t'=50 s, another event occurs (like a photon leaving or something). We need to find the distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during the time between these two events.\n\nSo to find the distance, we can compute the velocity in S multiplied by the time interval in S.\n\nBut first, we need to find the time interval in S, t, that corresponds to t' =50 s.\n\nSo using the Lorentz transformation for time. The time in S is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 ), but in S', the two events happen at the same place (x' =0), because the ejecta doesn't move in its own frame. So x' is 0. Thus, t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 ). Since v is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c.\n\nSo v = 0.2c, so v\u00b2 = 0.04 c\u00b2. So 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96. So gamma is 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nWait, let me compute it accurately. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, so 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s \u2248 51.03 s.\n\nSo in the Galaxy's frame, the time elapsed is approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nNow, the ejecta's velocity in S is v = -60,000 km/s (but wait, no, in our earlier setup, the velocity in S is v = -60,000 km/s, but wait, wait: earlier, we thought that in S, the ejecta's velocity is v = -60,000 km/s, but that's not correct because v was determined from the velocity addition formula. Wait, no, earlier we determined that in S, the ejecta's velocity is v = -60,000 km/s, because u' (Galaxy's velocity in S') is 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. Earlier, using the velocity addition formula, we found that in S, the ejecta's velocity is v = -60,000 km/s. But that would mean that from S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy (negative direction) at 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo the distance the ejecta travels in S during time t is distance = v * t. But wait, v is negative (towards the Galaxy), but distance is scalar, so we take the absolute value. Or perhaps the question is about the distance in terms of displacement, but the problem states \"what distance the ejecta travels\"\u2014so probably the distance is |v| * t.\n\nWait, but the question says \"what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\" So in S, the ejecta is moving at v = -60,000 km/s. The time elapsed in S is t \u224851.03 s. So the distance it travels is |v| * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 km = 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. The options are 2.94e6, 3e6, 2.88e6, 3.06e6.\n\nWait, 3,061,800 km is approximately 3.06e6 km. Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. So that's very close. So the answer would be D.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recalculate gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c. So v\u00b2 = (0.2c)^2 = 0.04 c\u00b2.\n\nSo 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nt = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 = 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 km/s *51.03 s = 60,000 *51.03 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 *50 = 3,000,000. 60,000 *1.03 = 61,800. So total is 3,061,800 km. So that's 3,061,800 km, which is about 3.0618e6 km. The option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the time in S is t = gamma * t'. Wait, no, that's correct because in S', the two events occur at the same place, so x'=0, so the time in S is t = gamma * t'.\n\nBut wait, another approach: maybe using the proper time. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the object. Wait, but the ejecta's frame is S', so the proper time would be t' for events happening in S'. But when considering two events happening at the same place in S', the time between them is the proper time.\n\nWait, but in this case, the events are the start and end of the 50 seconds in S'. So the proper time is t' =50 s. The time in S is t = gamma * t'. So that's the same as before.\n\nWait, but perhaps the distance is v * t, where v is 60,000 km/s and t is the time in S, which is t = gamma *50 s.\n\nSo 60,000 km/s * gamma *50 s = 60,000 * 50 * gamma km.\n\nSo 60,000 *50 =3e6, and 3e6 * gamma (1.0206) =3e6 *1.0206=3,061,800 km.\n\nSo the answer would be approximately 3.06e6 km, which is option D: 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the calculation gives 3,061,800 km, which is 3.0618e6, but option D is 3.06e6. Hmm, perhaps the approximation in gamma is causing this.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\nGamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.02062365.\n\nSo 1.02062365 *50 =51.0311825 s.\n\nThen, 60,000 km/s * 51.0311825 s = 60,000 *51.0311825 = 3,061,870.95 km.\n\nWhich is approximately 3,061,871 km. So when rounded to the nearest 100,000, it would be 3.06e6, which is option D.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta moves directly towards the center of the Galaxy, and in the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy's center appears to move towards the ejecta at a velocity of 60,000 km/s. Using special relativity, we calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame (S) over a 50-second interval in the ejecta's frame.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Relating Velocities Between Frames**:  \n   Using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame (S) is determined to be \\( v = -60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) (negative sign indicates motion towards the Galaxy).\n\n2. **Time Dilation**:  \n   The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (\\( t' = 50 \\, \\text{s} \\)) is related to the time in the Galaxy's frame (\\( t \\)) by the Lorentz factor:\n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}, \\quad \\text{where } v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} = 0.2c.\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( v = 0.2c \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206.\n   \\]\n   The time in the Galaxy's frame is:\n   \\[\n   t = \\gamma t' = 1.0206 \\times 50 \\, \\text{s} \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  \n   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = |v| \\cdot t = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\cdot 51.03 \\, \\text{s}.\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = 60,000 \\cdot 51.03 = 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Matching the Closest Option**:  \n   The calculated distance (\\( 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km} \\)) is closest to the provided option \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame over 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame is approximately \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\).\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think this through.\n\nThe question says that in the ejecta's frame of reference, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at that speed, right? Because in one frame, the object moves one way, in the other, it's the opposite direction but same speed.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, no\u2014wait, the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So, I need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame, but using the time measured in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, that sounds like a time dilation problem, perhaps.\n\nWait, but wait. Are we considering relativity here? Because if the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, then time dilation and length contraction would come into play. Let me check: 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 6e4 is 0.2 times the speed of light. Hmm, that's 20% the speed of light. So, relativistic effects are noticeable but maybe not super extreme. But for precise calculation, we should consider the time dilation factor.\n\nWait, the problem is about finding the distance in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So, the time experienced by the ejecta is 50 seconds, but the galaxy would measure a longer time, perhaps. Because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving, so their clocks are ticking slower.\n\nWait, no, wait. In special relativity, the moving clock runs slower. So, if the ejecta is moving at v relative to the galaxy, the galaxy's frame sees the ejecta's clock as running slow. So, if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (proper time), the galaxy would see more time passing.\n\nWait, but the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame. So, from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at v (60,000 km/s), and the time is longer than 50 seconds. So, the distance would be v multiplied by the dilated time.\n\nWait, but the problem states that both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. So, we can use special relativity here.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote v as the relative speed between the two frames. So, v = 60,000 km/s. The proper time in the ejecta's frame is t' = 50 seconds. We need to find the distance d in the galaxy's frame. So, d = v * t, where t is the time measured in the galaxy's frame.\n\nBut how is t related to t'? Since the galaxy is observing the ejecta's clock, the time t in the galaxy's frame is longer than t' due to time dilation. The time dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same place. But in this case, the two events are the start of the 50 seconds and the end, which are moving relative to each other. So, the proper time is actually the time in the ejecta's frame. So, t' is the proper time. Therefore, from the galaxy's frame, the time is longer.\n\nSo, the gamma factor would be gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). Let me compute that.\n\nv = 6e4 km/s = 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s = 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 1 km/s is 1e3 m/s. So, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. But the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So, v = 6e7 m/s, which is 0.2c, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, let's compute gamma.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).\n\nv\u00b2 = (6e7)^2 = 3.6e15 (m\u00b2/s\u00b2)\nc\u00b2 = (3e8)^2 = 9e16 (m\u00b2/s\u00b2)\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 3.6e15 / 9e16 = 0.04.\n\nSo, sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.98.\n\nSo, gamma is 1 / 0.98 \u2248 1.0204.\n\nSo, the time t in the galaxy's frame is gamma multiplied by t', so t = 1.0204 * 50 \u2248 51.02 seconds.\n\nWait, but that's a small gamma. So, the time in the galaxy's frame is about 51 seconds. So, the distance the ejecta travels is v multiplied by t. Wait, but v is 60,000 km/s, and t is about 51 seconds.\n\nWait, no, no. Wait, the galaxy's frame sees the ejecta moving at v, and the time is t. So, the distance is v * t. So, 60,000 km/s * 51 seconds = 60,000 * 51 km = 3,060,000 km. Wait, but 60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000, so 51 would be 3,060,000 km. That's option D.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I got the time dilation direction wrong. Let me think again. The proper time is the shortest time between two events. The proper time t' is in the ejecta's frame, which is moving relative to the galaxy. So, from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock runs slower. So, for each second in the ejecta's frame, more than a second passes in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but when the ejecta's clock reads t', the galaxy's clock reads t = gamma * t'. So, yes, I think that's correct. So, t = gamma * t' \u2248 1.0204 *50 \u224851.02 s.\n\nSo, the distance is v * t = 60,000 km/s *51.02 s \u2248 3,061,200 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely.\n\nWait, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, so gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. So, t =50 * 1.0206 \u224851.03 s. So, 60,000 *51.03 = 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but the options are in increments of 60,000. So, perhaps I should consider the exact calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering relativity. Oh wait, but the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, etc., but it doesn't say to ignore relativity. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the time dilation.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think again. From the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, and the time experienced in the galaxy's frame is longer. So, the distance is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nBut perhaps I should use the time in the ejecta's frame without considering dilation, which would be wrong, but let's see what happens. If I do that, distance would be 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that's assuming no time dilation, which is only true for non-relativistic speeds. Since 60,000 km/s is 20% of c, it's relativistic, so time dilation can't be ignored.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to use time dilation, giving about 3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n\nWait, but maybe I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) more precisely.\n\nv\u00b2 = (6e7)^2 = 3.6e15.\n\nc\u00b2=9e16.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2=0.04.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = let's compute it accurately.\n\nWe can compute sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.9798.\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, t =50 * 1.0206 \u224851.03 s.\n\nSo, 60,000 km/s *51.03 s = 60,000 *51.03 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nSo, 3,061,800 is closest to option D, 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me calculate sqrt(0.96) accurately.\n\nWe can compute it using a Taylor expansion or a calculator approach.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use the exact expression. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to neglect relativistic effects and just compute d = v * t. So, 60,000 *50 =3e6 km, which is option B. But that's probably incorrect because the speed is a significant fraction of c, so relativity would matter.\n\nWait, but the question says that both frames are inertial, so perhaps the problem expects you to use the time from the ejecta's frame without considering relativity. Wait, but that would be the wrong approach because the time experienced in each frame is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the distance in the ejecta's frame, but the question says it's the distance in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, no, the question is clear: \"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nSo, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, and the time elapsed is longer than 50 seconds. So, the correct approach is to compute using time dilation.\n\nWait, but let me think about the scenario. The ejecta's frame experiences 50 seconds. So, the galaxy's frame would see more time passing. So, the distance is v multiplied by the dilated time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering relativity, but that would be a mistake.\n\nBut looking at the options, option B is 3e6 km, which is 60,000 *50. So, perhaps the intended answer is B, but that would be incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. So, the distance the galaxy moves towards the ejecta is v * t' =60,000 *50=3e6 km. But the question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame. Oh wait, no, wait: from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy. So, the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but the galaxy's frame sees the ejecta moving, and the time is longer. So, the distance would be v * gamma * t' =60,000 * gamma *50.\n\nGamma is about 1.0206, so 60,000 *50 *1.0206=3e6 *1.0206\u22483,061,800 km, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to use the Lorentz transformation. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the distance in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So, the galaxy's frame would see the ejecta moving, and the time is longer. So, the distance is v multiplied by the dilated time.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be option D, 3,060,000 km.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think this through.\n\nThe question says that in the ejecta's frame of reference, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at that speed, right? Because in one frame, the object moves one way, in the other, it's the opposite direction but same speed.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, no\u2014wait, the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So, I need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame, but using the time measured in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, that sounds like a time dilation problem, perhaps.\n\nWait, but wait. Are we considering relativity here? Because if the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, then time dilation and length contraction would come into play. Let me check: 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 6e4 is 0.2 times the speed of light. Hmm, that's 20% the speed of light. So, relativistic effects are noticeable but maybe not super extreme. But for precise calculation, we should consider the time dilation factor.\n\nWait, the problem is about finding the distance in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So, the time experienced by the ejecta is 50 seconds, but the galaxy would measure a longer time, perhaps. Because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving, so their clocks are ticking slower.\n\nWait, no, wait. In special relativity, the moving clock runs slower. So, if the ejecta is moving at v relative to the galaxy, the galaxy's frame sees the ejecta's clock as running slow. So, if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (proper time), the galaxy would see more time passing.\n\nWait, but the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame. So, from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at v (60,000 km/s), and the time is longer than 50 seconds. So, the distance would be v multiplied by the dilated time.\n\nWait, but the problem states that both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. So, we can use special relativity here.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote v as the relative speed between the two frames. So, v = 60,000 km/s. The proper time in the ejecta's frame is t' = 50 seconds. We need to find the distance d in the galaxy's frame. So, d = v * t, where t is the time measured in the galaxy's frame.\n\nBut how is t related to t'? Since the galaxy is observing the ejecta's clock, the time t in the galaxy's frame is longer than t' due to time dilation. The time dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same place. But in this case, the two events are the start of the 50 seconds and the end, which are moving relative to each other. So, the proper time is actually the time in the ejecta's frame. So, t' is the proper time. Therefore, from the galaxy's frame, the time is longer.\n\nSo, the gamma factor would be gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). Let me compute that.\n\nv = 6e4 km/s = 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s = 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 1 km/s is 1e3 m/s. So, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. But the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So, v = 6e7 m/s, which is 0.2c, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, let's compute gamma.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).\n\nv\u00b2 = (6e7)^2 = 3.6e15 (m\u00b2/s\u00b2)\nc\u00b2 = (3e8)^2 = 9e16 (m\u00b2/s\u00b2)\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 3.6e15 / 9e16 = 0.04.\n\nSo, sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.98.\n\nSo, gamma is 1 / 0.98 \u2248 1.0204.\n\nSo, the time t in the galaxy's frame is gamma multiplied by t', so t = 1.0204 * 50 \u2248 51.02 seconds.\n\nWait, but that's a small gamma. So, the time in the galaxy's frame is about 51 seconds. So, the distance the ejecta travels is v multiplied by t. Wait, but v is 60,000 km/s, and t is about 51 seconds.\n\nWait, no, no. Wait, the galaxy's frame sees the ejecta moving at v, and the time is t. So, the distance is v * t. So, 60,000 km/s * 51 seconds = 60,000 * 51 km = 3,060,000 km. Wait, but 60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000, so 51 would be 3,060,000 km. That's option D.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I got the time dilation direction wrong. Let me think again. The proper time is the shortest time between two events. The proper time t' is in the ejecta's frame, which is moving relative to the galaxy. So, from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock runs slower. So, for each second in the ejecta's frame, more than a second passes in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but when the ejecta's clock reads t', the galaxy's clock reads t = gamma * t'. So, yes, I think that's correct. So, t = gamma * t' \u2248 1.0204 *50 \u224851.02 s.\n\nSo, the distance is v * t = 60,000 km/s *51.02 s \u2248 3,061,200 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely.\n\nWait, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, so gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. So, t =50 * 1.0206 \u224851.03 s. So, 60,000 *51.03 = 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but the options are in increments of 60,000. So, perhaps I should consider the exact calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering relativity. Oh wait, but the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, etc., but it doesn't say to ignore relativity. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the time dilation.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think again. From the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, and the time experienced in the galaxy's frame is longer. So, the distance is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nBut perhaps I should use the time in the ejecta's frame without considering dilation, which would be wrong, but let's see what happens. If I do that, distance would be 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that's assuming no time dilation, which is only true for non-relativistic speeds. Since 60,000 km/s is 20% of c, it's relativistic, so time dilation can't be ignored.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to use time dilation, giving about 3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n\nWait, but maybe I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) more precisely.\n\nv\u00b2 = (6e7)^2 = 3.6e15.\n\nc\u00b2=9e16.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2=0.04.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = let's compute it accurately.\n\nWe can compute sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.9798.\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, t =50 * 1.0206 \u224851.03 s.\n\nSo, 60,000 km/s *51.03 s = 60,000 *51.03 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nSo, 3,061,800 is closest to option D, 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me calculate sqrt(0.96) accurately.\n\nWe can compute it using a Taylor expansion or a calculator approach.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use the exact expression. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to neglect relativistic effects and just compute d = v * t. So, 60,000 *50 =3e6 km, which is option B. But that's probably incorrect because the speed is a significant fraction of c, so relativity would matter.\n\nWait, but the question says that both frames are inertial, so perhaps the problem expects you to use the time from the ejecta's frame without considering relativity. Wait, but that would be the wrong approach because the time experienced in each frame is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the distance in the ejecta's frame, but the question says it's the distance in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, no, the question is clear: \"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nSo, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, and the time elapsed is longer than 50 seconds.

So, perhaps the intended answer is B, but that would be incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. So, the distance the galaxy moves towards the ejecta is v * t' =60,000 *50=3e6 km. But the question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame. Oh wait, no, wait: from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy.

So, the distance would be v * gamma * t' =60,000 * gamma *50.\n\nGamma is about 1.0206, so 60,000 *50 *1.0206=3e6 *1.0206\u22483,061,800 km, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to use the Lorentz transformation.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with reference frames and maybe some special relativity concepts. Let me try to think it through.\n\nThe problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, right? Because if one frame sees the other moving, the other sees the first moving at the same speed but in the opposite direction, assuming they're inertial frames. Oh wait, but wait\u2014Galilean transformations would just swap velocities, but since this is about high speeds (like 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light), I think I need to use the Lorentz transformation here.\n\nWait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. So relativistic effects might matter here. But the question is about the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm.\n\nSo in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. But due to time dilation, the galaxy's frame would see a different time. Alternatively, maybe I should find the relationship between the two frames' times.\n\nWait, let's think about it. The problem is probably asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. But wait, the time that passes in the galaxy's frame isn't necessarily the same as the time in the ejecta's frame because of time dilation.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So I need to find how much time passes in the galaxy's frame during those 50 seconds. Then, multiply the galaxy's frame velocity by that time to get the distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other way around. Let me clarify. The ejecta's frame is moving relative to the galaxy's frame. So, if the ejecta experiences 50 seconds, how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, time dilation is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So v is 60,000 km/s. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, 60,000 km/s is 0.2c (since 0.2 * 3e5 km/s = 6e4 km/s). So v = 0.2c.\n\nSo gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me compute that. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98. Because 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is close to 0.96. So 1/0.98 is approximately 1.0204. So gamma is about 1.0204.\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately. Let's see, 1 - (0.2)^2 = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is the square root of 96/100, which is sqrt(96)/10. sqrt(96) is about 9.798. So 9.798 /10 is 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0205. So gamma is approximately 1.0205.\n\nSo, the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than the ejecta's frame. Because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slow.\n\nWait, no, wait. The time in the galaxy's frame (S) is the proper time? Or is the ejecta's frame (S') the moving frame. Hmm.\n\nIn the scenario, the ejecta is moving at v relative to the galaxy. So in the galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta's clock is running slow. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the galaxy's clock shows more than 50 seconds. Because the galaxy's frame is the rest frame, and the ejecta's frame is moving.\n\nSo the time in the galaxy's frame (t) is related to the ejecta's time (t') by t = gamma * t'. So t = 1.0205 * 50 \u2248 51.025 seconds.\n\nThen, the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v * t. v is 60,000 km/s, t is about 51.025 seconds.\n\nSo 60,000 * 51.025 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km. 60,000 * 1.025 = 61,500 km. So total is approximately 3,061,500 km. Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are A) 2,940,000; B) 3,000,000; C)2,880,000; D)3,060,000.\n\nWait, my approximation for gamma was 1.0205. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2). So 0.2^2 is 0.04. 1 - 0.04 is 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(96)/10. sqrt(96) is 9.798... Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more precisely.\n\nWait, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. So sqrt(0.96) is a bit less than 0.98. Let me compute 0.9798^2: (0.9798)^2 = (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 \u2248 0.9604 - 2*0.98*0.0002 + (0.0002)^2 = approx 0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004 \u2248 0.960008. So that's very close to 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 is approximately 1.0205.\n\nSo, gamma is approximately 1.0205.\n\nSo, t = 50 * 1.0205 = 51.025 seconds.\n\nThen, distance is v * t. v is 60,000 km/s. So 60,000 *51.025 = ?\n\nLet me compute 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000. Then 60,000 * 0.025 = 1,500. So total is 3,061,500 km.\n\nWait, but the options don't have that. The closest is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe I should calculate the distance using length contraction or something else.\n\nWait, another approach. From the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. So in 50 seconds (in the ejecta's frame), the galaxy's frame would have passed a longer time.\n\nWait, but in the galaxy's frame, the time is longer. So the distance the ejecta travels is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nBut how do I find the time in the galaxy's frame when the ejecta's frame has 50 seconds?\n\nWait, time in the galaxy's frame is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 ). But x' is the position in the ejecta's frame. Wait, but in this case, the event is the passage of 50 seconds. So in the ejecta's frame, the event is a time interval of 50 seconds, and the same event (the passage of 50 seconds) in the galaxy's frame would have a longer time.\n\nWait, the formula for time transformation is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 ). But in this case, since the event is the same point in space (the same location in the ejecta's frame), or not? Wait, no. Wait, the problem is about the ejecta moving, so in the ejecta's frame, the center of the galaxy is approaching at v. So the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) occur at the same location in the ejecta's frame, but in the galaxy's frame, those events are at different locations.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the problem as the passage of time in the ejecta's frame and find the corresponding time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of velocity and time.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame? It's longer, because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is moving, so it runs slower.\n\nSo from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is ticking slower. So for each second in the ejecta's frame, more than a second has passed in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, so the time in the galaxy's frame would be t = gamma * t'. So t = 1.0205 * 50 \u2248 51.025 seconds.\n\nSo the ejecta travels at 60,000 km/s for 51.025 seconds in the galaxy's frame.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 *51.025 = 60,000 *51 + 60,000 *0.025.\n\n60,000 *51 = 3,060,000 km.\n\n60,000 *0.025 = 1,500 km.\n\nSo total is 3,061,500 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this value. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate gamma more accurately.\n\nLet me compute gamma precisely.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\nGamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nCalculating sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) with more precision.\n\nWe know that 0.96 is 96/100 = 24/25.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5.\n\nsqrt(24) is approximately 4.89898.\n\nSo sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 4.89898 /5 \u2248 0.979796.\n\nSo 1/sqrt(0.96) = 1/0.979796 \u2248 1.020305.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020305.\n\nSo t = 50 * 1.020305 \u2248 51.01525 seconds.\n\nNow, distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.01525 s.\n\n60,000 * 51.01525 = ?\n\nLet me compute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000.\n\n60,000 * 0.01525 = 915 km.\n\nSo total is 3,060,000 + 915 = 3,060,915 km.\n\nHmm, that's about 3,060,915 km. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. But perhaps I should consider that the time is 51.01525 seconds, which is 51.01525.\n\nWait, 60,000 *51.01525 = 60,000*(51 + 0.01525) = 3,060,000 + 60,000 *0.01525.\n\n60,000 *0.01525 = 915 km.\n\nSo 3,060,915 km. Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the approximation is being made, and the intended answer is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem doesn't require considering relativistic effects, and just uses classical mechanics. Let me check.\n\nIf I ignore relativity, then from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. The time in the galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, if you're in the galaxy's frame, then you see the ejecta moving at 60,000 km/s. So in 50 seconds, the ejecta travels 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km. Which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So if you ignore relativity, the time in the galaxy's frame would be the same as the ejecta's frame. So the distance is 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km. Which is option B.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the two frames are moving relative to each other, so time would dilate. But perhaps the problem expects a non-relativistic approach, given that it's a supernova\u2014maybe the intended answer is B.\n\nBut wait, the question says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, but says nothing about relativity. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify to use relativity, but the speed is 60,000 km/s, which is 20% the speed of light, so relativistic effects are non-negligible.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is intended to be solved with the Galilean transformation. Because in Galilean, the time is the same in both frames. So the distance would be 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut that seems conflicting with the earlier approach. So which is it?\n\nWait, the problem says that both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. So according to special relativity, time dilation occurs. So the correct approach would involve using the Lorentz transformation.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut looking at the options, D is 3,060,000, which is very close to 3,060,915. So perhaps the intended answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by that longer time. So the distance is 60,000 * gamma *50.\n\nSo 60,000 * 1.0203 *50 = 60,000 *51.015 \u2248 3,060,900 km.\n\nBut the option D is 3,060,000, which is very close, but perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation. So the answer would be D.\n\nWait, but looking back, I think I got the time dilation direction wrong. Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at v. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v towards the galaxy. So the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than the ejecta's frame. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the galaxy's clock shows more than that.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 km/s multiplied by 51.015 seconds, giving around 3,060,900 km. So the closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the proper time. Wait, no. Proper time is the shortest time, which would be in the rest frame. Wait, but which frame is the rest frame here?\n\nWait, the center of the Galaxy and the ejecta are both in inertial frames. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving. So the proper time is in the galaxy's frame. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be a simple velocity multiplied by time, without considering relativity. So 60,000 km/s *50 s = 3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut the problem says that the ejecta and Galaxy are inertial frames, which implies that relativity is in play. So I think the correct approach is to use the Lorentz factor.\n\nBut wait, another angle: the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time measured in the Galaxy's frame. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. So v is 60,000 km/s, and the time is gamma multiplied by 50.\n\nSo, yes, 60,000 * gamma *50 = 60,000 * 50 *1.0203 = 3,000,000 *1.0203 = 3,060,900 km.\n\nWhich is approximately 3,060,900 km, but the option is D) 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the problem expects an approximate answer, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the velocity addition formula, but that doesn't directly apply here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about relative velocity, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the time as per the ejecta's frame without considering dilation. So the galaxy's frame sees the ejecta moving at 60,000 km/s for 50 seconds. But no, that would give 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would neglect relativity.\n\nBut given that the problem states that both are inertial frames, I think the correct approach is to use the relativistic time dilation. So the answer should be approximately 3,060,900 km, which is closest to option D, 3,060,000 km.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with reference frames and maybe some special relativity concepts. Let me try to think it through.\n\nThe problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, right? Because if one frame sees the other moving, the other sees the first moving at the same speed but in the opposite direction, assuming they're inertial frames. Oh wait, but wait\u2014Galilean transformations would just swap velocities, but since this is about high speeds (like 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light), I think I need to use the Lorentz transformation here.\n\nWait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. So relativistic effects might matter here. But the question is about the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm.\n\nSo in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. But due to time dilation, the galaxy's frame would see a different time. Alternatively, maybe I should find the relationship between the two frames' times.\n\nWait, let's think about it. The problem is probably asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. But wait, the time that passes in the galaxy's frame isn't necessarily the same as the time in the ejecta's frame because of time dilation.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So I need to find how much time passes in the galaxy's frame during those 50 seconds. Then, multiply the galaxy's frame velocity by that time to get the distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other way around. Let me clarify. The ejecta's frame is moving relative to the galaxy's frame. So, if the ejecta experiences 50 seconds, how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, time dilation is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So v is 60,000 km/s. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, 60,000 km/s is 0.2c (since 0.2 * 3e5 km/s = 6e4 km/s). So v = 0.2c.\n\nSo gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me compute that. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98. Because 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is close to 0.96. So 1/0.98 is approximately 1.0204. So gamma is about 1.0204.\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately. Let's see, 1 - (0.2)^2 = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is the square root of 96/100, which is sqrt(96)/10. sqrt(96) is about 9.798. So 9.798 /10 is 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0205. So gamma is approximately 1.0205.\n\nSo, the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than the ejecta's frame. Because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slow.\n\nWait, no, wait. The time in the galaxy's frame (S) is the proper time? Or is the ejecta's frame (S') the moving frame. Hmm.\n\nIn the scenario, the ejecta is moving at v relative to the galaxy. So in the galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta's clock is running slow. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the galaxy's clock shows more than 50 seconds. Because the galaxy's frame is the rest frame, and the ejecta's frame is moving.\n\nSo the time in the galaxy's frame (t) is related to the ejecta's time (t') by t = gamma * t'. So t = 1.0205 * 50 \u2248 51.025 seconds.\n\nThen, the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v * t. v is 60,000 km/s, t is about 51.025 seconds.\n\nSo 60,000 * 51.025 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km. 60,000 * 1.025 = 61,500 km. So total is approximately 3,061,500 km. Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are A) 2,940,000; B) 3,000,000; C)2,880,000; D)3,060,000.\n\nWait, my approximation for gamma was 1.0205. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2). So 0.2^2 is 0.04. 1 - 0.04 is 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(96)/10. sqrt(96) is 9.798... Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more precisely.\n\nWait, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. So sqrt(0.96) is a bit less than 0.98. Let me compute 0.9798^2: (0.9798)^2 = (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 \u2248 0.9604 - 2*0.98*0.0002 + (0.0002)^2 = approx 0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004 \u2248 0.960008. So that's very close to 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 is approximately 1.0205.\n\nSo, gamma is approximately 1.0205.\n\nSo, t = 50 * 1.0205 = 51.025 seconds.\n\nThen, distance is v * t. v is 60,000 km/s. So 60,000 *51.025 = ?\n\nLet me compute 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000. Then 60,000 * 0.025 = 1,500. So total is 3,061,500 km.\n\nWait, but the options don't have that. The closest is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe I should calculate the distance using length contraction or something else.\n\nWait, another approach. From the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. So in 50 seconds (in the ejecta's frame), the galaxy's frame would have passed a longer time.\n\nWait, but in the galaxy's frame, the time is longer. So the distance the ejecta travels is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nBut how do I find the time in the galaxy's frame when the ejecta's frame has 50 seconds?\n\nWait, time in the galaxy's frame is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 ). But x' is the position in the ejecta's frame. Wait, but in this case, the event is the passage of 50 seconds. So in the ejecta's frame, the event is a time interval of 50 seconds, and the same event (the passage of 50 seconds) in the galaxy's frame would have a longer time.\n\nWait, the formula for time transformation is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 ). But in this case, since the event is the same point in space (the same location in the ejecta's frame), or not? Wait, no. Wait, the problem is about the ejecta moving, so in the ejecta's frame, the center of the galaxy is approaching at v. So the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) occur at the same location in the ejecta's frame, but in the galaxy's frame, those events are at different locations.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the problem as the passage of time in the ejecta's frame and find the corresponding time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of velocity and time.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame? It's longer, because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is moving, so it runs slower.\n\nSo from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is ticking slower. So for each second in the ejecta's frame, more than a second has passed in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, so the time in the galaxy's frame would be t = gamma * t'. So t = 1.0205 * 50 \u2248 51.025 seconds.\n\nSo the ejecta travels at 60,000 km/s for 51.025 seconds in the galaxy's frame.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 *51.025 = 60,000 *51 + 60,000 *0.025.\n\n60,000 *51 = 3,060,000 km.\n\n60,000 *0.025 = 1,500 km.\n\nSo total is 3,061,500 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this value. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate gamma more accurately.\n\nLet me compute gamma precisely.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\nGamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nCalculating sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) with more precision.\n\nWe know that 0.96 is 96/100 = 24/25.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5.\n\nsqrt(24) is approximately 4.89898.\n\nSo sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 4.89898 /5 \u2248 0.979796.\n\nSo 1/sqrt(0.96) = 1/0.979796 \u2248 1.020305.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020305.\n\nSo t = 50 * 1.020305 \u2248 51.01525 seconds.\n\nNow, distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.01525 s.\n\n60,000 * 51.01525 = ?\n\nLet me compute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000.\n\n60,000 * 0.01525 = 915 km.\n\nSo total is 3,060,000 + 915 = 3,060,915 km.\n\nHmm, that's about 3,060,915 km. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. But perhaps I should consider that the time is 51.01525 seconds, which is 51.01525.\n\nWait, 60,000 *51.01525 = 60,000*(51 + 0.01525) = 3,060,000 + 60,000 *0.01525.\n\n60,000 *0.01525 = 915 km.\n\nSo 3,060,915 km. Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the approximation is being made, and the intended answer is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem doesn't require considering relativistic effects, and just uses classical mechanics. Let me check.\n\nIf I ignore relativity, then from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. The time in the galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, if you're in the galaxy's frame, then you see the ejecta moving at 60,000 km/s. So in 50 seconds, the ejecta travels 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km. Which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So if you ignore relativity, the time in the galaxy's frame would be the same as the ejecta's frame. So the distance is 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km. Which is option B.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the two frames are moving relative to each other, so time would dilate. But perhaps the problem expects a non-relativistic approach, given that it's a supernova\u2014maybe the intended answer is B.\n\nBut wait, the question says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, but says nothing about relativity.

So the correct approach would involve using the Lorentz transformation.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut looking at the options, D is 3,060,000, which is very close to 3,060,915. So perhaps the intended answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by that longer time. So the distance is 60,000 * gamma *50.\n\nSo 60,000 * 1.0203 *50 = 60,000 *51.015 \u2248 3,060,900 km.\n\nBut the option D is 3,060,000, which is very close, but perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation. So the answer would be D.\n\nWait, but looking back, I think I got the time dilation direction wrong. Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at v. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v towards the galaxy. So the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than the ejecta's frame. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the galaxy's clock shows more than that.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 km/s multiplied by 51.015 seconds, giving around 3,060,900 km. So the closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the proper time. Wait, no. Proper time is the shortest time, which would be in the rest frame. Wait, but which frame is the rest frame here?\n\nWait, the center of the Galaxy and the ejecta are both in inertial frames. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving. So the proper time is in the galaxy's frame. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be a simple velocity multiplied by time, without considering relativity. So 60,000 km/s *50 s = 3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut the problem says that the ejecta and Galaxy are inertial frames, which implies that relativity is in play. So I think the correct approach is to use the Lorentz factor.\n\nBut wait, another angle: the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time measured in the Galaxy's frame. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. So v is 60,000 km/s, and the time is gamma multiplied by 50.\n\nSo, yes, 60,000 * gamma *50 = 60,000 * 50 *1.0203 = 3,000,000 *1.0203 = 3,060,900 km.\n\nWhich is approximately 3,060,900 km, but the option is D) 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the problem expects an approximate answer, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the velocity addition formula, but that doesn't directly apply here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about relative velocity, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the time as per the ejecta's frame without considering dilation. So the galaxy's frame sees the ejecta moving at 60,000 km/s for 50 seconds. But no, that would give 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would neglect relativity.\n\nBut given that the problem states that both are inertial frames, I think the correct approach is to use the relativistic time dilation. So the answer should be approximately 3,060,900 km, which is closest to option D, 3,060,000 km.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving at a velocity of \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) (or \\( 0.2c \\)) towards the center of the Galaxy. The problem specifies that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame of reference, and we are tasked with determining the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  \n   Since the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, relativistic effects must be considered. The time dilation factor, \\( \\gamma \\), is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( v = 0.2c \\):\n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0205\n   \\]\n\n2. **Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:  \n   The time in the Galaxy's frame (\\( t \\)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\\( t' \\)) by:\n   \\[\n   t = \\gamma \\cdot t'\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( t' = 50 \\, \\text{s} \\) and \\( \\gamma \\approx 1.0205 \\):\n   \\[\n   t \\approx 1.0205 \\cdot 50 \\approx 51.025 \\, \\text{s}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  \n   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is:\n   \\[\n   d = v \\cdot t\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( t \\approx 51.025 \\, \\text{s} \\):\n   \\[\n   d \\approx 60,000 \\cdot 51.025 \\approx 3,061,500 \\, \\text{km}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Comparison with Options**:  \n   The calculated distance (\\( \\approx 3,061,500 \\, \\text{km} \\)) is closest to option \\( D \\), which is \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\). The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding approximations in the problem setup.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\).\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the scenario is that a supernova occurs in our galaxy. Part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, I think that means in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.\n\nWait, no, wait. In special relativity, velocities don't just add like that because of the relativity of motion. Oh wait, but wait, the problem says both are inertial frames, which implies that they are moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. So it's a case of Galilean relativity, not special relativity? Or is it? Hmm, maybe I should think about whether it's in the realm of classical mechanics or if I need to consider relativity.\n\nWait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe it's just a straightforward velocity transformation. But wait, the problem is about distance traveled in a certain frame when a certain time passes in another frame. Oh, wait, that's a question about time dilation and length contraction maybe?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. So the two frames are moving relative to each other at that speed.\n\nNow, the question is: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, so in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. We need to find how much distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during that time.\n\nWait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So if I can find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame, I can multiply by velocity to get the distance.\n\nBut how are the time intervals related between the two frames? Because of time dilation, right? So the time measured in one frame is different from the other when they are moving relative to each other.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem doesn't mention anything about acceleration, just that both are inertial frames. So we can apply the Lorentz transformations here.\n\nSo, let's get into the variables. Let me denote the Galaxy frame as S and the ejecta frame as S'. The velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S (Galaxy) is v = 60,000 km/s. Wait, no. Wait, in the ejecta's frame S', the Galaxy is moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame S, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the center. So v is 6e4 km/s.\n\nWait, but 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 6e4 is 0.2c. So relativistic effects may be significant.\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame S', the time elapsed is t' = 50 seconds. We need to find how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame S during that period. Then, the distance the ejecta travels in S is v * t.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about the direction. If in S', the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, then in S, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy. So the time experienced in S would be longer due to time dilation, perhaps?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The time measured in S' is t', and we need to find the corresponding time t in S. The relationship between the two is given by the Lorentz transformation.\n\nThe Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So gamma is greater than 1 when v is significant compared to c.\n\nThe time dilation formula is t = gamma * (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2), but since the event is happening at the same position in S', x' = 0 (assuming the event is the start and end at the same point in S'). Wait, not exactly. Hmm.\n\nWait, the events are: in S', the time between two events is t' =50 s, and the position of the event (ejecta moving) is at x'=0 in both events (since it's the same point in the ejecta's frame). So applying the Lorentz transformation for time:\n\nt = gamma * (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 )\n\nBut x' is zero because both events happen at the same location in S'. So t = gamma * t'\n\nSo the time in S is longer than in S' by a factor of gamma.\n\nSo gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nCompute v: 6e4 km/s. Let me convert that to m/s for easier calculation, but maybe not necessary. Alternatively, let's compute v as a fraction of c.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s = 6e7 m/s (since 1 km is 1e3 m, so 6e4 * 1e3 = 6e7 m/s). Wait, no, wait. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 6e4 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. But c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v = 6e7 m/s, c=3e8 m/s.\n\nv/c = (6e7)/(3e8) )= 0.2. So 0.2c.\n\nSo v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04. 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, but that's the time in the Galaxy frame S. So in S, the time elapsed is approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, the distance the ejecta travels in S is v * t. Because in S, the ejecta is moving at v=6e4 km/s.\n\nSo distance d = v * t.\n\nv is 6e4 km/s, t is approximately 51.03 s.\n\nSo d = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s = 6e4 * 51.03 km.\n\nCalculate that: 6e4 = 60,000. 60,000 * 51.03 = ?\n\nLet me compute 60,000 *50 =3,000,000. Then 60,000 *1.03=61,800. So total is 3,000,000 +61,800=3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, that would be approximately 3,061,800 km. Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, that's very close.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation of gamma.\n\nWait, let's compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 0.2c. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.04.\n\n1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) = let's compute it more accurately.\n\nsqrt(0.96) is sqrt(96/100) = (sqrt(96))/10. sqrt(96)=approx 9.798 (since 9.798^2 = 95.98, which is about 96). So 9.798/10=0.9798. So gamma is 1/0.9798 = approx 1.0206.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 1/sqrt(0.96) exactly.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = 0.9797958971132678.\n\nSo 1 / 0.9797958971132678 = approximately 1.02060576.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.02060576.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = 1.02060576 * 50 = 51.030288 seconds.\n\nSo t \u224851.030288 s.\n\nThen, distance d = v * t.\n\nv is 6e4 km/s. So 60,000 km/s *51.030288 s = 60,000 *51.030288 km.\n\nLet me compute 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000. Then 60,000 *0.030288 = 60,000 *0.03 =1,800, plus 60,000 *0.000288=17.28. So 1,800 +17.28=1,817.28.\n\nSo total d=3,060,000 + 1,817.28= 3,061,817.28 km.\n\nWhich is approximately 3,061,817 km. So looking at the options:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close but 1,817 km less than our calculated value. So why is that?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that in the ejecta frame, the center of the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy.\n\nBut the question is, in the galaxy's frame, how far does the ejecta move when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have considered length contraction instead of time dilation. Because from the ejecta's frame, the distance to the galaxy's center is contracted.\n\nWait, no, because the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame depends on the time measured in the Galaxy's frame. So the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by a longer time.\n\nBut maybe I'm mixing up frames.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the proper time.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the time is t' =50 s. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the moving object, which in this case, perhaps the ejecta's frame is the rest frame of the event? Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the velocity addition formula.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this problem using the concept of simultaneity and how time intervals transform.\n\nWait, another approach: in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the time that has passed is t, and the distance the ejecta has moved is d = v * t.\n\nBut t is not the same as t' (50 s). Because in the ejecta's frame, the time is shorter.\n\nWait, no, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at v. So from the ejecta's perspective, the time between events (e.g., the start of the motion and after 50s) is t' =50 s. But in the galaxy's frame, the time is longer.\n\nSo, the time in the galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' (since the events are at the same place in S', so t = gamma t').\n\nSo t= gamma *50.\n\nThen, d = v * t = v * gamma * t'.\n\nWait, but v is 6e4 km/s, gamma is approximately 1.0206, and t' is 50 s.\n\nSo d=6e4 *1.0206 *50.\n\nWait, 6e4 is 60,000, 1.0206 *50=51.03.\n\nSo d=60,000 *51.03= as before, 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this exact number. Option D is 3,060,000 km. Close, but perhaps the question expects an approximate calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.02060576.\n\nSo t = 50 * 1.02060576 = 51.030288 s.\n\nd=60,000 km/s *51.030288 s = 60,000 *51.030288 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 *51 = 3,060,000.\n\n60,000 *0.030288 = 1,817.28.\n\nTotal: 3,061,817.28 km.\n\nHmm. None of the options match exactly, but D is 3,060,000 km, which is 1,817 km less. So perhaps the question expects an approximate answer, but why?\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used a different approach. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved using the Galilean transformation instead of special relativity, given that the velocity is 60,000 km/s which is 0.2c, but perhaps the intended solution neglects relativistic effects, treating it classically.\n\nWait, if that's the case, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. The time in the ejecta's frame is t' =50 s. But in the Galaxy's frame, the time would be longer. But wait, in Galilean relativity, time is the same in all frames. So if t' is 50 s, then t is also 50 s. So the distance would be v * t =60,000 *50=3,000,000 km.\n\nWhich is option B.\n\nBut that seems contradictory because the problem states that both are inertial frames, which in relativity implies that we have to account for time dilation.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a Galilean approach, considering that 60,000 km/s is a high speed but maybe the problem assumes that relativistic effects are negligible or that it's a simple velocity multiplication.\n\nWait, but 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is not negligible. So I think the correct approach is to consider special relativity.\n\nBut the options don't have 3,061,800 km. So maybe the question expects us to approximate gamma as 1, meaning t \u2248 t', and so the distance is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the distance the galaxy's center travels in the ejecta's frame in 50 seconds is d'=v*t'=60,000 *50=3,000,000 km.\n\nBut how does that distance relate to the Galaxy's frame? Because of length contraction.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the distance to the galaxy's center is contracted. So in the Galaxy's frame, the actual distance is longer.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the distance in the Galaxy's frame is proper length if the measurement is at rest. Let me think.\n\nThe proper length is the length measured in the rest frame of the object. In this case, the distance between the ejecta and the galaxy's center is a proper length in the Galaxy's frame because the galaxy is at rest there.\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame, the length is contracted. So L' = L / gamma.\n\nSo L' = L / gamma.\n\nBut in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving, so the distance is L'.\n\nBut in our case, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy. So in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at speed v. The time it takes to reach is t' = L' / v.\n\nWait, but L' is the contracted length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about how the time in the ejecta's frame relates to the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me set up the problem using Lorentz transformations.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame (S'), the galaxy's center is moving towards it at velocity v. So the position of the galaxy's center as a function of time in S' is x' = -v t'.\n\nBut wait, at t' =0, x'=0, and as time increases, the galaxy's center approaches the ejecta.\n\nIn the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v. So the position of the ejecta as a function of time in S is x = v t.\n\nBut we need to relate the times and positions in both frames.\n\nUsing the Lorentz transformation: x = gamma (x' + v t').\n\nBut in the ejecta's frame, when the ejecta has been moving for t'=50 seconds, where is the galaxy's center?\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me think about the event where the ejecta has moved a certain distance in S.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find the distance the ejecta has moved in S in the time t, which is gamma * t' (since t' is 50 s, and t= gamma t').\n\nBut wait, that's what I did earlier. So d= v * t = v gamma t'.\n\nHmm, but that gives 3,061,817 km, which isn't an option. So I'm a bit stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe question says: part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the center of the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo in S' (ejecta's frame), the galaxy is approaching at v=6e4 km/s. So in S (galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v=6e4 km/s.\n\nSo, in S (galaxy's frame), the time that has passed when t'=50 s is t=gamma (t' + (v x')/c^2). But since the event (the movement) happens at x'=0 (same point), t=gamma t'.\n\nSo t= gamma *50.\n\nSo d= v * t = v gamma t'.\n\nWhich is 6e4 * gamma *50.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. So why the discrepancy with the options?\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use the approximation that gamma is close to 1, so we can ignore the relativistic effects. But the option B is 3e6 km, which is 6e4 *50, exactly. So that would be the case if gamma is taken as 1.\n\nBut that would ignore time dilation, which is a relativistic effect. But maybe the problem expects that approach, thinking that 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is not extremely high, but perhaps the intended solution is to ignore relativity and compute it as a classical problem.\n\nIf so, then the distance is 6e4 *50 =3e6 km, which is option B.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Because the problem says that both are inertial frames, which in relativity implies that we should account for time dilation. So I'm torn between two approaches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is testing knowledge of reference frames and relative motion without considering relativity.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't mention anything about the speed being a significant fraction of c, so perhaps the intended solution is to treat it classically, ignoring relativity.\n\nIn that case, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 6e4 km/s, and the time is 50 s.\n\nSo d=6e4 *50 =3e6 km.\n\nWhich is option B.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So in 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, how far does the ejecta move in the galaxy's frame?\n\nBut in the classical approach, the time would be the same in both frames, so distance is 6e4 *50=3e6, which is option B.\n\nBut according to relativity, the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is longer, which would point to option D as the correct answer.\n\nBut the options don't include 3,061,800 km, but D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation without considering the exact gamma. Let's see, gamma is approximately 1.0206, so 50 *1.0206=51.03. So 6e4 *51.03= 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut none of the options exactly match. The closest is D:3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate using v=6e4 km/s and t=50 s, without considering time dilation, which would give 3e6 km, option B. But that seems incorrect from a relativistic perspective.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the speed as 60,000 km/s but using a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the distance in the galaxy's frame as the same as the distance in the ejecta's frame divided by gamma.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at speed v, so in 50 seconds, the galaxy's center moves 6e4 *50=3e6 km towards the ejecta. But this is the distance in the ejecta's frame. In the galaxy's frame, this distance would be longer due to length contraction.\n\nWait, wait. No, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving, so the distance is contracted. So the proper length (in the galaxy's frame) is longer.\n\nWait, the proper length is the length in the frame where the two points (ejecta and galaxy center) are at rest. So the proper length L is in the galaxy's frame.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the length is L' = L / gamma.\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center moves a distance L' = v t' =6e4 *50=3e6 km.\n\nSo, L' = L / gamma \u2192 L = gamma * L' = gamma *3e6.\n\nWhich would be approximately 1.0206 *3e6 =3,061,800 km.\n\nWhich again brings us back to the same number as before.\n\nSo in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta has moved 3,061,800 km. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is D:3,060,000 km, which is approximately this value, considering rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate using the velocity as 6e4 km/s and time as 50 s, leading to 3e6 km, option B.\n\nBut given that the problem states that both are inertial frames, which suggests relativity is involved, I think the correct approach is the relativistic one, leading to approximately 3,061,800 km. Since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D, 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, perhaps it's a matter of velocity addition.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at v=6e4 km/s. So, perhaps the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame is v=6e4 km/s.\n\nSo, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=6e4 km/s, and the time elapsed is t=gamma * t' =51.03 s.\n\nSo the distance is 6e4 *51.03=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut since this isn't an option, perhaps the problem is intended to be treated classically, leading to option B.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The problem is a bit ambiguous in that aspect.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the problem is testing knowledge of reference frames and relative motion without involving time dilation. So, perhaps the time in the galaxy's frame is the same as in the ejecta's frame, leading to 3e6 km.\n\nBut that would be incorrect in the context of relativity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it, so the time experienced is less. Wait, no, that's not how it works.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here. But given the options, and considering that 3,060,000 km is option D, which is the closest to our relativistic calculation, I think that's the intended answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. The task is to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during the time 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relative Motion and Frames**:  \n   - In the galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\).  \n   - In the ejecta's frame (S'), the galaxy's center is approaching at the same speed \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\).  \n\n2. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  \n   - The time elapsed in the galaxy's frame (\\( t \\)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\\( t' \\)) by the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\):  \n     \\[\n     t = \\gamma t'\n     \\]\n     where  \n     \\[\n     \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n     \\]\n   - Given \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} = 0.2c \\), we calculate:  \n     \\[\n     \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206\n     \\]\n   - Thus,  \n     \\[\n     t = \\gamma t' = 1.0206 \\times 50 \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{seconds}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  \n   - The distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is:  \n     \\[\n     d = v \\cdot t\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( t = 51.03 \\, \\text{s} \\):  \n     \\[\n     d = 60,000 \\times 51.03 \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Comparison with Options**:  \n   - The calculated distance (\\( 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km} \\)) is closest to option \\( \\mathbf{D} \\, (3,060,000 \\, \\text{km}) \\).  \n   - Option \\( \\mathbf{B} \\, (3,000,000 \\, \\text{km}) \\) corresponds to a classical (non-relativistic) calculation where \\( t = t' \\), but this ignores time dilation and is inconsistent with the problem's relativistic context.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe relativistic calculation gives \\( d \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km} \\), and the closest option is \\( \\mathbf{D} \\, (3,060,000 \\, \\text{km}) \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the scenario is that a supernova occurs in our galaxy. Part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, I think that means in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.\n\nWait, no, wait. In special relativity, velocities don't just add like that because of the relativity of motion. Oh wait, but wait, the problem says both are inertial frames, which implies that they are moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. So it's a case of Galilean relativity, not special relativity? Or is it? Hmm, maybe I should think about whether it's in the realm of classical mechanics or if I need to consider relativity.\n\nWait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe it's just a straightforward velocity transformation. But wait, the problem is about distance traveled in a certain frame when a certain time passes in another frame. Oh, wait, that's a question about time dilation and length contraction maybe?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. So the two frames are moving relative to each other at that speed.\n\nNow, the question is: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, so in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. We need to find how much distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during that time.\n\nWait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So if I can find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame, I can multiply by velocity to get the distance.\n\nBut how are the time intervals related between the two frames? Because of time dilation, right? So the time measured in one frame is different from the other when they are moving relative to each other.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem doesn't mention anything about acceleration, just that both are inertial frames. So we can apply the Lorentz transformations here.\n\nSo, let's get into the variables. Let me denote the Galaxy frame as S and the ejecta frame as S'. The velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S (Galaxy) is v = 60,000 km/s. Wait, no. Wait, in the ejecta's frame S', the Galaxy is moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame S, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the center. So v is 6e4 km/s.\n\nWait, but 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 6e4 is 0.2c. So relativistic effects may be significant.\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame S', the time elapsed is t' = 50 seconds. We need to find how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame S during that period. Then, the distance the ejecta travels in S is v * t.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about the direction. If in S', the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, then in S, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy. So the time experienced in S would be longer due to time dilation, perhaps?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The time measured in S' is t', and we need to find the corresponding time t in S. The relationship between the two is given by the Lorentz transformation.\n\nThe Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So gamma is greater than 1 when v is significant compared to c.\n\nThe time dilation formula is t = gamma * (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2), but since the event is happening at the same position in S', x' = 0 (assuming the event is the start and end at the same point in S'). Wait, not exactly. Hmm.\n\nWait, the events are: in S', the time between two events is t' =50 s, and the position of the event (ejecta moving) is at x'=0 in both events (since it's the same point in the ejecta's frame). So applying the Lorentz transformation for time:\n\nt = gamma * (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 )\n\nBut x' is zero because both events happen at the same location in S'. So t = gamma * t'\n\nSo the time in S is longer than in S' by a factor of gamma.\n\nSo gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nCompute v: 6e4 km/s. Let me convert that to m/s for easier calculation, but maybe not necessary. Alternatively, let's compute v as a fraction of c.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s = 6e7 m/s (since 1 km is 1e3 m, so 6e4 * 1e3 = 6e7 m/s). Wait, no, wait. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 6e4 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. But c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v = 6e7 m/s, c=3e8 m/s.\n\nv/c = (6e7)/(3e8) )= 0.2. So 0.2c.\n\nSo v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04. 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, but that's the time in the Galaxy frame S. So in S, the time elapsed is approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, the distance the ejecta travels in S is v * t. Because in S, the ejecta is moving at v=6e4 km/s.\n\nSo distance d = v * t.\n\nv is 6e4 km/s, t is approximately 51.03 s.\n\nSo d = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s = 6e4 * 51.03 km.\n\nCalculate that: 6e4 = 60,000. 60,000 * 51.03 = ?\n\nLet me compute 60,000 *50 =3,000,000. Then 60,000 *1.03=61,800. So total is 3,000,000 +61,800=3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, that would be approximately 3,061,800 km. Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, that's very close.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation of gamma.\n\nWait, let's compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 0.2c. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.04.\n\n1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) = let's compute it more accurately.\n\nsqrt(0.96) is sqrt(96/100) = (sqrt(96))/10. sqrt(96)=approx 9.798 (since 9.798^2 = 95.98, which is about 96). So 9.798/10=0.9798. So gamma is 1/0.9798 = approx 1.0206.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 1/sqrt(0.96) exactly.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = 0.9797958971132678.\n\nSo 1 / 0.9797958971132678 = approximately 1.02060576.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.02060576.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = 1.02060576 * 50 = 51.030288 seconds.\n\nSo t \u224851.030288 s.\n\nThen, distance d = v * t.\n\nv is 6e4 km/s. So 60,000 km/s *51.030288 s = 60,000 *51.030288 km.\n\nLet me compute 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000. Then 60,000 *0.030288 = 60,000 *0.03 =1,800, plus 60,000 *0.000288=17.28. So 1,800 +17.28=1,817.28.\n\nSo total d=3,060,000 + 1,817.28= 3,061,817.28 km.\n\nWhich is approximately 3,061,817 km. So looking at the options:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close but 1,817 km less than our calculated value. So why is that?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that in the ejecta frame, the center of the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy.\n\nBut the question is, in the galaxy's frame, how far does the ejecta move when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have considered length contraction instead of time dilation. Because from the ejecta's frame, the distance to the galaxy's center is contracted.\n\nWait, no, because the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame depends on the time measured in the Galaxy's frame. So the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by a longer time.\n\nBut maybe I'm mixing up frames.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the proper time.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the time is t' =50 s. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the moving object, which in this case, perhaps the ejecta's frame is the rest frame of the event? Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the velocity addition formula.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this problem using the concept of simultaneity and how time intervals transform.\n\nWait, another approach: in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the time that has passed is t, and the distance the ejecta has moved is d = v * t.\n\nBut t is not the same as t' (50 s). Because in the ejecta's frame, the time is shorter.\n\nWait, no, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at v. So from the ejecta's perspective, the time between events (e.g., the start of the motion and after 50s) is t' =50 s. But in the galaxy's frame, the time is longer.\n\nSo, the time in the galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' (since the events are at the same place in S', so t = gamma t').\n\nSo t= gamma *50.\n\nThen, d = v * t = v * gamma * t'.\n\nWait, but v is 6e4 km/s, gamma is approximately 1.0206, and t' is 50 s.\n\nSo d=6e4 *1.0206 *50.\n\nWait, 6e4 is 60,000, 1.0206 *50=51.03.\n\nSo d=60,000 *51.03= as before, 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this exact number. Option D is 3,060,000 km. Close, but perhaps the question expects an approximate calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.02060576.\n\nSo t = 50 * 1.02060576 = 51.030288 s.\n\nd=60,000 km/s *51.030288 s = 60,000 *51.030288 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 *51 = 3,060,000.\n\n60,000 *0.030288 = 1,817.28.\n\nTotal: 3,061,817.28 km.\n\nHmm. None of the options match exactly, but D is 3,060,000 km, which is 1,817 km less. So perhaps the question expects an approximate answer, but why?\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used a different approach. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved using the Galilean transformation instead of special relativity, given that the velocity is 60,000 km/s which is 0.2c, but perhaps the intended solution neglects relativistic effects, treating it classically.\n\nWait, if that's the case, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. The time in the ejecta's frame is t' =50 s. But in the Galaxy's frame, the time would be longer. But wait, in Galilean relativity, time is the same in all frames. So if t' is 50 s, then t is also 50 s. So the distance would be v * t =60,000 *50=3,000,000 km.\n\nWhich is option B.\n\nBut that seems contradictory because the problem states that both are inertial frames, which in relativity implies that we have to account for time dilation.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a Galilean approach, considering that 60,000 km/s is a high speed but maybe the problem assumes that relativistic effects are negligible or that it's a simple velocity multiplication.\n\nWait, but 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is not negligible. So I think the correct approach is to consider special relativity.\n\nBut the options don't have 3,061,800 km. So maybe the question expects us to approximate gamma as 1, meaning t \u2248 t', and so the distance is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the distance the galaxy's center travels in the ejecta's frame in 50 seconds is d'=v*t'=60,000 *50=3,000,000 km.\n\nBut how does that distance relate to the Galaxy's frame? Because of length contraction.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the distance to the galaxy's center is contracted. So in the Galaxy's frame, the actual distance is longer.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the distance in the Galaxy's frame is proper length if the measurement is at rest. Let me think.\n\nThe proper length is the length measured in the rest frame of the object. In this case, the distance between the ejecta and the galaxy's center is a proper length in the Galaxy's frame because the galaxy is at rest there.\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame, the length is contracted. So L' = L / gamma.\n\nSo L' = L / gamma.\n\nBut in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving, so the distance is L'.\n\nBut in our case, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy. So in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at speed v. The time it takes to reach is t' = L' / v.\n\nWait, but L' is the contracted length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about how the time in the ejecta's frame relates to the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me set up the problem using Lorentz transformations.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame (S'), the galaxy's center is moving towards it at velocity v. So the position of the galaxy's center as a function of time in S' is x' = -v t'.\n\nBut wait, at t' =0, x'=0, and as time increases, the galaxy's center approaches the ejecta.\n\nIn the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v. So the position of the ejecta as a function of time in S is x = v t.\n\nBut we need to relate the times and positions in both frames.\n\nUsing the Lorentz transformation: x = gamma (x' + v t').\n\nBut in the ejecta's frame, when the ejecta has been moving for t'=50 seconds, where is the galaxy's center?\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me think about the event where the ejecta has moved a certain distance in S.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find the distance the ejecta has moved in S in the time t, which is gamma * t' (since t' is 50 s, and t= gamma t').\n\nBut wait, that's what I did earlier. So d= v * t = v gamma t'.\n\nHmm, but that gives 3,061,817 km, which isn't an option. So I'm a bit stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe question says: part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the center of the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo in S' (ejecta's frame), the galaxy is approaching at v=6e4 km/s. So in S (galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v=6e4 km/s.\n\nSo, in S (galaxy's frame), the time that has passed when t'=50 s is t=gamma (t' + (v x')/c^2). But since the event (the movement) happens at x'=0 (same point), t=gamma t'.\n\nSo t= gamma *50.\n\nSo d= v * t = v gamma t'.\n\nWhich is 6e4 * gamma *50.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. So why the discrepancy with the options?\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use the approximation that gamma is close to 1, so we can ignore the relativistic effects. But the option B is 3e6 km, which is 6e4 *50, exactly. So that would be the case if gamma is taken as 1.\n\nBut that would ignore time dilation, which is a relativistic effect. But maybe the problem expects that approach, thinking that 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is not extremely high, but perhaps the intended solution is to ignore relativity and compute it as a classical problem.\n\nIf so, then the distance is 6e4 *50 =3e6 km, which is option B.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Because the problem says that both are inertial frames, which in relativity implies that we should account for time dilation. So I'm torn between two approaches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is testing knowledge of reference frames and relative motion without considering relativity.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't mention anything about the speed being a significant fraction of c, so perhaps the intended solution is to treat it classically, ignoring relativity.\n\nIn that case, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 6e4 km/s, and the time is 50 s.\n\nSo d=6e4 *50 =3e6 km.\n\nWhich is option B.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So in 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, how far does the ejecta move in the galaxy's frame?\n\nBut in the classical approach, the time would be the same in both frames, so distance is 6e4 *50=3e6, which is option B.\n\nBut according to relativity, the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is longer, which would point to option D as the correct answer.\n\nBut the options don't include 3,061,800 km, but D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation without considering the exact gamma. Let's see, gamma is approximately 1.0206, so 50 *1.0206=51.03. So 6e4 *51.03= 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut none of the options exactly match. The closest is D:3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate using v=6e4 km/s and t=50 s, without considering time dilation, which would give 3e6 km, option B. But that seems incorrect from a relativistic perspective.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the speed as 60,000 km/s but using a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the distance in the galaxy's frame as the same as the distance in the ejecta's frame divided by gamma.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at speed v, so in 50 seconds, the galaxy's center moves 6e4 *50=3e6 km towards the ejecta. But this is the distance in the ejecta's frame. In the galaxy's frame, this distance would be longer due to length contraction.\n\nWait, wait. No, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving, so the distance is contracted. So the proper length (in the galaxy's frame) is longer.\n\nWait, the proper length is the length in the frame where the two points (ejecta and galaxy center) are at rest. So the proper length L is in the galaxy's frame.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the length is L' = L / gamma.\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center moves a distance L' = v t' =6e4 *50=3e6 km.\n\nSo, L' = L / gamma \u2192 L = gamma * L' = gamma *3e6.\n\nWhich would be approximately 1.0206 *3e6 =3,061,800 km.\n\nWhich again brings us back to the same number as before.\n\nSo in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta has moved 3,061,800 km. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is D:3,060,000 km, which is approximately this value, considering rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate using the velocity as 6e4 km/s and time as 50 s, leading to 3e6 km, option B.\n\nBut given that the problem states that both are inertial frames, which suggests relativity is involved, I think the correct approach is the relativistic one, leading to approximately 3,061,800 km. Since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D, 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, perhaps it's a matter of velocity addition.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at v=6e4 km/s. So, perhaps the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame is v=6e4 km/s.\n\nSo, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=6e4 km/s, and the time elapsed is t=gamma * t' =51.03 s.\n\nSo the distance is 6e4 *51.03=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut since this isn't an option, perhaps the problem is intended to be treated classically, leading to option B.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The problem is a bit ambiguous in that aspect.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the problem is testing knowledge of reference frames and relative motion without involving time dilation. So, perhaps the time in the galaxy's frame is the same as in the ejecta's frame, leading to 3e6 km.\n\nBut that would be incorrect in the context of relativity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it, so the time experienced is less. Wait, no, that's not how it works.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here. But given the options, and considering that 3,060,000 km is option D, which is the closest to our relativistic calculation, I think that's the intended answer.\n\n\nThe problem involves a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. The task is to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during the time 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relative Motion and Frames**:  \n   - In the galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\).  \n   - In the ejecta's frame (S'), the galaxy's center is approaching at the same speed \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\).  \n\n2. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  \n   - The time elapsed in the galaxy's frame (\\( t \\)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\\( t' \\)) by the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\):  \n     \\[\n     t = \\gamma t'\n     \\]\n     where  \n     \\[\n     \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n     \\]\n   - Given \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} = 0.2c \\), we calculate:  \n     \\[\n     \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206\n     \\]\n   - Thus,  \n     \\[\n     t = \\gamma t' = 1.0206 \\times 50 \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{seconds}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  \n   - The distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is:  \n     \\[\n     d = v \\cdot t\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( t = 51.03 \\, \\text{s} \\):  \n     \\[\n     d = 60,000 \\times 51.03 \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Comparison with Options**:  \n   - The calculated distance (\\( 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km} \\)) is closest to option \\( \\mathbf{D} \\, (3,060,000 \\, \\text{km}) \\).  \n   - Option \\( \\mathbf{B} \\, (3,000,000 \\, \\text{km}) \\) corresponds to a classical (non-relativistic) calculation where \\( t = t' \\), but this ignores time dilation and is inconsistent with the problem's relativistic context.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe relativistic calculation gives \\( d \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km} \\), and the closest option is \\( \\mathbf{D} \\, (3,060,000 \\, \\text{km}) \\). This is the most reasonable answer given the problem's relativistic framework.\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nAlright, the problem says that a part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. So from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, so we need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame. Hmm. Since the two frames are moving relative to each other, there's probably a length contraction or time dilation involved. But wait, in the problem statement, it says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So I can focus purely on special relativity here.\n\nLet me think about the frames. In the ejecta's frame (let's call it S'), the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But wait, when considering relative motion, the speed isn't just additive. Oh wait, but wait, the problem says both are inertial frames, so we can apply the Lorentz transformations.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. The question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in S' (ejecta's frame), the time is 50 seconds. I need to find the corresponding distance in S (Galaxy's frame).\n\nWait, but wait, no. Let me clarify: the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame (S'). So the time experienced in S' is 50 s. I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, S. So in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. So the distance would be speed multiplied by time, but wait, the time is in S' frame. So how does time in S' translate to time in S?\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta. From the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.\n\nBut the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame (S) during the time that 50 seconds pass in S'. So I need to find how much time passes in S during those 50 seconds in S', and then multiply the speed (60,000 km/s) by that time to get the distance in S.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe it's about the distance in S when the time in S' is 50 seconds. So perhaps I should use the Lorentz transformation for time. Let me recall the Lorentz equations.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation equations relate the time and space coordinates between two frames moving relative to each other. The velocity between the frames is v. Let's define v as the speed of the Galaxy as seen from the ejecta, which is 60,000 km/s. But wait, in S', the Galaxy is moving at velocity v, so in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the Galaxy.\n\nWait, no, the velocity between S and S' is v. Let me be precise. Let's say S is the Galaxy's frame, and S' is the ejecta's frame. Then, in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity v = -60,000 km/s (since it's moving towards the center, which is in the direction of motion). So in S, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me get the direction correct. In S' (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So in S' frame, the Galaxy's velocity is +60,000 km/s (assuming direction towards the ejecta is positive). So from S' to S, the relative velocity is v = -60,000 km/s (because S is moving at +60,000 km/s relative to S').\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the frames as S and S'. Let's say that S is the Galaxy's rest frame, and S' is the ejecta's rest frame. Then, in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity v = +60,000 km/s (towards the center, which is in the positive direction). So, from S to S', the relative velocity is v = +60,000 km/s. So the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).\n\nWait, but wait, let's compute v in terms of km/s. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Let's compute the value of v/c, since that's important for gamma.\n\nThe speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 6e4 km/s is 0.2 times c, because 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2. So v = 0.2c.\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.98 \u2248 1.0204.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.2 squared is 0.04. So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nNow, the time in S' is t' = 50 seconds. I need to find the corresponding time in S, t.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for time when there's no spatial component (since the events are at the same point in S' perhaps?) is t = gamma (t' + (v x') / c\u00b2). But wait, in this case, the events in question are: the start and end of the time interval in S'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about how much time passes in S during the 50 seconds in S'. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the distance the ejecta travels in S, which is v * t, where t is the time in S.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simpler. Because from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. So in the time t that passes in S, the ejecta travels distance d = v * t.\n\nBut the problem is that t is not given directly. The given time is in S' (50 seconds). So I need to find t, the time in S.\n\nWait, so in S', the time is t' = 50 s. So how to relate t and t'?\n\nIn special relativity, the time experienced in different frames depends on their relative motion. The Lorentz transformation for time when the events are at the same position in S' (like the start and end of the time interval) is t = gamma (t' + (v x') / c\u00b2).\n\nBut in this case, the events are the same point in S' \u2014 the start and end of the 50 seconds in S'. So x' = 0 for both events. So the equation simplifies to t = gamma * t'.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. If the events are the same in x' (i.e., x' is the same for both events, say at the origin of S'), then the equation becomes t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2). But x' is zero for both events, so t = gamma * t'.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's think of two events: the start (t'=0, x'=0) and the end (t'=50 s, x'=0 in S'). So in S, the time for the end event is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2) = gamma t' because x' is zero.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, so in S, the time is about 51.03 seconds. So the distance the ejecta travels in S is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 ?\n\nWait, 60,000 km/s times 51.03 seconds would be 60,000 * 51.03 km = 3,061,800 km. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's close, but perhaps my approximation for gamma is a bit off. Let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nCompute gamma again: v = 0.2c. So (v^2/c^2) is 0.04. So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.020605.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020605.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = 1.020605 * 50 = 51.03025 seconds.\n\nSo the distance in S is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03025 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.03025 = 3,061,815 km.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, so my calculation gives approximately 3,061,815 km, which is closest to option D, 3,060,000 km. But let me check if I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have considered that the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer due to time dilation. But wait, the problem is that the ejecta's frame is moving relative to the Galaxy, so time in S' (ejecta) runs slower than in S (Galaxy) when viewed from S. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. From S (Galaxy) perspective, the ejecta's clock (S') is moving at v, so it would run slower. So the time in S is longer than in S'.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, t = gamma * t'. Since gamma is greater than 1, t is greater than t'. So 50 s in S' correspond to about 51.03 s in S. So the ejecta travels for 51.03 s in S, moving at 60,000 km/s. So distance is 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km, which is about 3,060,000 km, matching option D.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps we can compute the distance using the velocity and the time as seen in S, but perhaps I should calculate the proper time. Hmm, but the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end) happen at the same place. But in this case, the start and end are at different places in S and S'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think again. The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass, and we need to find the distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during that time.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So from S', the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in S', the distance the Galaxy travels towards the ejecta in 50 seconds is 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km.\n\nWait, but that would be the distance the Galaxy moves in S' frame. But the question is about the distance the ejecta moves in S frame. Hmm, so maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it as follows: in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) is speed * time. But the time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, so we need to find the corresponding time in S.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated that in S, the time is gamma * t' \u2248 51.03 s, so distance is 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about length contraction. Wait, but the distance the ejecta travels in S is the same as the distance the Galaxy would approach in S', but perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, another approach: using the velocity addition formula. Wait, no, I think the earlier approach is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 3,000,000 km, but that would be if the time was 50 seconds in S, which isn't the case. So no, that can't be right.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is option D, 3,060,000 km.\n",

Let's compute the value of v/c, since that's important for gamma.\n\nThe speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 6e4 km/s is 0.2 times c, because 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2.

So the distance the ejecta travels in S is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 ?\n\nWait, 60,000 km/s times 51.03 seconds would be 60,000 * 51.03 km = 3,061,800 km. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's close, but perhaps my approximation for gamma is a bit off. Let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nCompute gamma again: v = 0.2c. So (v^2/c^2) is 0.04. So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.020605.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020605.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = 1.020605 * 50 = 51.03025 seconds.\n\nSo the distance in S is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03025 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.03025 = 3,061,815 km.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, so my calculation gives approximately 3,061,815 km, which is closest to option D, 3,060,000 km. But let me check if I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have considered that the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer due to time dilation. But wait, the problem is that the ejecta's frame is moving relative to the Galaxy, so time in S' (ejecta) runs slower than in S (Galaxy) when viewed from S. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. From S (Galaxy) perspective, the ejecta's clock (S') is moving at v, so it would run slower. So the time in S is longer than in S'.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, t = gamma * t'. Since gamma is greater than 1, t is greater than t'. So 50 s in S' correspond to about 51.03 s in S. So the ejecta travels for 51.03 s in S, moving at 60,000 km/s. So distance is 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km, which is about 3,060,000 km, matching option D.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps we can compute the distance using the velocity and the time as seen in S, but perhaps I should calculate the proper time. Hmm, but the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end) happen at the same place. But in this case, the start and end are at different places in S and S'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think again. The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass, and we need to find the distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during that time.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So from S', the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in S', the distance the Galaxy travels towards the ejecta in 50 seconds is 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km.\n\nWait, but that would be the distance the Galaxy moves in S' frame. But the question is about the distance the ejecta moves in S frame. Hmm, so maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it as follows: in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) is speed * time. But the time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, so we need to find the corresponding time in S.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated that in S, the time is gamma * t' \u2248 51.03 s, so distance is 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about length contraction. Wait, but the distance the ejecta travels in S is the same as the distance the Galaxy would approach in S', but perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, another approach: using the velocity addition formula. Wait, no, I think the earlier approach is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 3,000,000 km, but that would be if the time was 50 seconds in S, which isn't the case. So no, that can't be right.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is option D, 3,060,000 km.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy using special relativity. The ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, and the relative velocity between them is \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\). Since \\( v = 0.2c \\), the Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206.\n\\]\n\nIn the ejecta's frame (S'), 50 seconds pass. To find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame (S), we use the time dilation relationship:\n\n\\[\nt = \\gamma t'.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\gamma \\approx 1.0206 \\) and \\( t' = 50 \\, \\text{s} \\):\n\n\\[\nt = 1.0206 \\times 50 \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s}.\n\\]\n\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is given by:\n\n\\[\nd = v \\cdot t.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( t \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s} \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 60,000 \\times 51.03 \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km}.\n\\]\n\nAmong the options provided, the closest value is \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\), which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. And I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, okay. So, the key here is to relate the time experienced in the ejecta's frame to the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame. Since both are inertial frames, I think this involves special relativity, specifically time dilation or length contraction.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think. If the ejecta is moving at a high speed relative to the Galaxy, then from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock would be running slow. Or wait, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So the speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. That's a significant fraction of the speed of light, so we can't ignore relativity effects.\n\nSo, the problem gives the time in the ejecta's frame as 50 seconds. I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during that time. But wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards them. Wait, no, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center, which is the same as the direction the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta from the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this using the Lorentz transformation. Because we're dealing with two different reference frames moving relative to each other at a constant velocity.\n\nLet me think about the situation. Let's denote the Galaxy's frame as S, and the ejecta's frame as S'. In S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity v. So in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at velocity v. So the velocity is v = 60,000 km/s. But wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so v is 0.2c.\n\nSo, in S' (ejecta frame), the time passed is t' = 50 seconds. I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) during that time. Wait, no, wait. In S', the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy is moving towards it at v. So in S', the time elapsed is t' =50s. So the distance the ejecta would have moved in S is determined by the velocity in S.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in S (Galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving towards the center at v. So, the distance it travels in S is v multiplied by the time in S. But the problem is that the time given is in S', so I need to find the time in S.\n\nAh, right. So, time dilation comes into play. The time experienced in S (Galaxy) is longer than the time in S' (ejecta) because the ejecta's frame is moving relative to the Galaxy.\n\nWait, the formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t', where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So, if in S', the time is t', then in S, the time is longer by a factor of gamma.\n\nWait, but which frame is moving relative to which? The ejecta's frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. So, from S's perspective, S' is moving at v. So, events in S' would have their time dilated as seen from S.\n\nSo, the time t in S is equal to gamma multiplied by (t' + (v x' ) / c\u00b2 ), but wait, that's for the general case. But in this scenario, in S', the event is the passage of time without any spatial displacement in S'\u2014because in S', the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. Wait, no, the event in question is the movement of the ejecta, but from S's perspective, the ejecta is moving.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's think about the motion. In S', the ejecta is at rest. The Galaxy is approaching at velocity v. So, in S', the time is t' =50s. I need to find the distance the ejecta moves in S. But wait, the ejecta is stationary in S', so in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at v.\n\nSo, the distance in S is v multiplied by the time in S. But what's the time in S?\n\nWait, the time in S is the time in S' multiplied by gamma, but only if the events happen at the same place in S'. Since in S', the events (start and end of the time) are at the same point (ejecta is stationary), so the formula simplifies.\n\nSo, t = gamma * t'\n\nBut wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The time between two events in S is related to the time in S' by:\n\nt = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 )\n\nBut for events that occur at the same place in S' (x' =0), then t = gamma * t'\n\nSo in this case, in S', the two events (start and end of the 50s) occur at the same position (x'=0). So the time in S is t = gamma * t'\n\nSo, t = gamma * 50 s\n\nOnce I find t, the distance in S (Galaxy frame) is v multiplied by t.\n\nWait, but wait: in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy (so towards the center) at speed v. So, the distance it covers is v * t.\n\nSo, putting it together: distance = v * gamma * t'\n\nSo, I need to compute gamma first.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s\n\nc = 3e5 km/s\n\nSo, v = 0.2c.\n\nGamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1/0.98 \u2248 1.0204 approximately. Wait, let me compute that more accurately.\n\nWait, sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = (sqrt(96))/10. Sqrt(96) is about 9.798, so 9.798 /10 = 0.9798. So 1/sqrt(0.96) is about 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.0206.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let's compute 1 - (0.2)^2 = 1 -0.04= 0.96.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96) = let me calculate it:\n\nsqrt(0.96) = approximately 0.9797959.\n\nSo, 1 / 0.9797959 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 = approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, the distance in the Galaxy frame is v * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s.\n\nWait, 6e4 is 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 *51.03 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that: 60,000 *50 =3,000,000, 60,000 *1.03 = 61,800. So total is 3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, that's about 3.06e6 km.\n\nLooking at the options: option D is 3,060,000 km. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2c)^2 /c^2 )= 1 / sqrt(1 -0.04)= 1/sqrt(0.96).\n\nAlternatively, using more precise calculation, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, 1.0206 multiplied by 50 is 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. Hmm, perhaps I should compute more precisely.\n\nWait, let's compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 0.96^0.5.\n\nWait, 0.96 = 96/100 = 24/25.\n\nSo sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5.\n\nsqrt(24) is approximately 4.89898.\n\nSo sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 4.89898 /5 \u2248 0.979796.\n\nSo, 1/sqrt(0.96)=1.020604.\n\nSo gamma =1.020604.\n\nt = 1.020604 *50 =51.0302 seconds.\n\nDistance is v * t = 6e4 km/s *51.0302 s =60,000 *51.0302 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n60,000 *50 =3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.0302=60,000 *1 =60,000, 60,000 *0.0302=1,812.\n\nSo 60,000 +1,812 =61,812.\n\nSo total distance is 3,000,000 +61,812 =3,061,812 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. The options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm. So my calculation gives 3,061,812 km, which is approximately 3,061,812 km. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider that perhaps the problem expects me to not use the Lorentz factor and just use the given speed. But no, because the time is given in the ejecta's frame, so we have to account for time dilation.\n\nWait another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v=60,000 km/s. So, from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at 6e4 km/s, and the time is 50s. So, the distance the Galaxy travels towards the ejecta is v*t' =6e4 *50= 3e6 km.\n\nWait, but that's in the ejecta's frame. But the question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards them at v, so the distance would be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy moves 3e6 km in 50s. So, from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy has moved 3e6 km. But from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving 3e6 km in that time? No, because of length contraction.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The distance between two points in different frames is different. So, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nBut the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than in the ejecta's frame due to time dilation. So, t = gamma * t' \u22481.0206 *50\u224851.03s.\n\nSo, distance is v * t =6e4 km/s *51.03s=3,061,800 km. So, 3,061,800 km, which is approximately 3,062,000 km. But the option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. So the correct answer should be D.\n",

So 1/sqrt(0.96) is about 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.0206.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let's compute 1 - (0.2)^2 = 1 -0.04= 0.96.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96) = let me calculate it:\n\nsqrt(0.96) = approximately 0.9797959.\n\nSo, 1 / 0.9797959 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 = approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, the distance in the Galaxy frame is v * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s.\n\nWait, 6e4 is 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 *51.03 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that: 60,000 *50 =3,000,000, 60,000 *1.03 = 61,800. So total is 3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, that's about 3.06e6 km.\n\nLooking at the options: option D is 3,060,000 km. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2c)^2 /c^2 )= 1 / sqrt(1 -0.04)= 1/sqrt(0.96).\n\nAlternatively, using more precise calculation, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, 1.0206 multiplied by 50 is 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. Hmm, perhaps I should compute more precisely.\n\nWait, let's compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 0.96^0.5.\n\nWait, 0.96 = 96/100 = 24/25.\n\nSo sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5.\n\nsqrt(24) is approximately 4.89898.\n\nSo sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 4.89898 /5 \u2248 0.979796.\n\nSo, 1/sqrt(0.96)=1.020604.\n\nSo gamma =1.020604.\n\nt = 1.020604 *50 =51.0302 seconds.\n\nDistance is v * t = 6e4 km/s *51.0302 s =60,000 *51.0302 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n60,000 *50 =3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.0302=60,000 *1 =60,000, 60,000 *0.0302=1,812.\n\nSo 60,000 +1,812 =61,812.\n\nSo total distance is 3,000,000 +61,812 =3,061,812 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. The options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm. So my calculation gives 3,061,812 km, which is approximately 3,061,812 km. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider that perhaps the problem expects me to not use the Lorentz factor and just use the given speed. But no, because the time is given in the ejecta's frame, so we have to account for time dilation.\n\nWait another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v=60,000 km/s. So, from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at 6e4 km/s, and the time is 50s. So, the distance the Galaxy travels towards the ejecta is v*t' =6e4 *50= 3e6 km.\n\nWait, but that's in the ejecta's frame. But the question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards them at v, so the distance would be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy moves 3e6 km in 50s. So, from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy has moved 3e6 km. But from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving 3e6 km in that time? No, because of length contraction.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The distance between two points in different frames is different. So, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nBut the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than in the ejecta's frame due to time dilation. So, t = gamma * t' \u22481.0206 *50\u224851.03s.\n\nSo, distance is v * t =6e4 km/s *51.03s=3,061,800 km. So, 3,061,800 km, which is approximately 3,062,000 km. But the option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. So the correct answer should be D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), which is \\( 0.2c \\) (where \\( c = 300,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\)). The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is \\( t' = 50 \\, \\text{s} \\). We need to calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relating Time in Different Frames**:  \n   Since the two frames (Galaxy and ejecta) are inertial and moving relative to each other, time dilation applies. The time in the Galaxy's frame (\\( t \\)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\\( t' \\)) by the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\):\n   \\[\n   t = \\gamma \\cdot t'\n   \\]\n   where:\n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( v = 0.2c \\):\n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206\n   \\]\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   t = 1.0206 \\cdot 50 \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculating Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:  \n   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = v \\cdot t\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( t = 51.03 \\, \\text{s} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = 60,000 \\cdot 51.03 \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Matching the Closest Option**:  \n   The calculated distance (\\( 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km} \\)) is closest to option \\( D \\), which is \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\). This slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding approximations in the calculations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when \\( 50 \\, \\text{s} \\) pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\).\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nThe question says that a supernova occurred in our Galaxy, and part of its ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the key here is probably about relative motion and reference frames. Since both are inertial frames, I don't have to worry about acceleration or anything like that\u2014just constant velocities.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at that speed. But what does that mean in the Galaxy's frame? Oh right, because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Because the frames are moving relative to each other, right?\n\nWait no, actually, wait. If in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy. Because the two frames are moving at that relative velocity. So, the speed is the same but in opposite directions.\n\nSo the question is, how much distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame in a certain time. But wait, the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So the time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. But since the frames are moving, the time experienced in each frame is different. Wait, no, actually, in special relativity, moving clocks run slower, but since the problem says both are inertial and we're dealing with classical mechanics, perhaps we can ignore relativistic effects like time dilation.\n\nWait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. It doesn't mention relativity or anything, so maybe we can treat this as a simple relative velocity problem without considering time dilation or length contraction.\n\nSo, the problem is about the distance in the Galaxy's frame. Let's break it down.\n\nIn the Galaxy's frame (let's call this frame S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. The time we need to find is the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame, but wait, no. Wait, the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame (S'). So how does time in S' relate to time in S?\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during that time. But if the time in S' is 50 seconds, how does that translate to the time in S (Galaxy's frame)?\n\nWait, this might be where I'm getting stuck. Since the frames are moving relative to each other, the time experienced in each frame isn't the same. But again, the problem doesn't mention relativity, so perhaps we're supposed to assume that time is the same in both frames, which would be the case in Newtonian mechanics. But that might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the velocity to calculate the distance, but using the time from the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, because the distance in the Galaxy's frame would depend on the time as observed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to find the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, I need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame corresponding to 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but without knowing the relative velocity, how can I compute the time dilation? Hmm. Let me think. The relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 20% of the speed of light. Hmm, so that's a significant fraction, but not super high.\n\nBut the problem says to ignore gravity and such, but I don't know if it's expecting me to ignore relativity. Because if we don't, then time dilation would affect the calculation.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So, perhaps we are supposed to consider that the time in each frame is different due to their relative motion. So, to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, we need to calculate how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame while 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but how do you compute that? Because in special relativity, moving clocks run slower. So, from the perspective of the Galaxy (S), the ejecta's clock (S') is moving at 60,000 km/s, so it's running slow. So, if 50 seconds pass in S', then in S, more than 50 seconds have passed. Wait, no, because from S's frame, S' is moving, so their own time is the proper time. So, the time in S would be longer.\n\nWait, the time dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So, v is 60,000 km/s. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, let me compute v in terms of c. 60,000 km/s is (60,000 / 300,000) c = 0.2 c.\n\nSo, v = 0.2c. So, beta is 0.2. Then, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96). Hmm, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So, gamma is approximately 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, in the Galaxy's frame, 51.03 seconds pass while 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about how much time passes in S (Galaxy's frame) when S' (ejecta) measures 50 seconds.\n\nWait, the time measured in S is longer than in S' because S' is moving relative to S. So, for events that occur at the same place in S' (like the start and end of the 50 seconds), the time in S would be longer.\n\nSo, the time in S is t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t. Wait, v is the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame, which is 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.03 = let me compute that.\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000. 60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800. So total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Close but not exactly the same. But maybe I approximated gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let's compute beta squared: (0.2)^2 = 0.04. So, 1 - beta^2 = 0.96. The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.9797958971. So, gamma is 1 / 0.9797958971 \u2248 1.020615556.\n\nSo, gamma is approximately 1.020615556. So, t = 50 * 1.020615556 = 51.0307778 seconds.\n\nThen, distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0307778 s = 60,000 * 51.0307778 = let's calculate that.\n\n51.0307778 * 60,000 = ?\n\nWell, 50 * 60,000 = 3,000,000.\n\n1.0307778 * 60,000 = 61,846.6728.\n\nAdding together: 3,000,000 + 61,846.6728 = 3,061,846.6728 km.\n\nSo approximately 3,061,847 km. Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, that's close, but not exact. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the distance in the Galaxy's frame is simply v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. But wait, is v in the same direction as the motion? Yes, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center at v=60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem expects a non-relativistic approach, ignoring time dilation. So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame. Then, the distance would be 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. That's option B.\n\nBut the problem says both are inertial frames, which in relativity they are, but if we ignore relativity, then time is the same in both frames. But the problem doesn't state to ignore relativity; it just says to ignore gravity, rotation, etc.\n\nHmm, this is a bit of a dilemma. The problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem statement says, \"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nSo, in the Galaxy's frame, how much time passes when 50 s pass in the ejecta's frame?\n\nWait, no, the problem says 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during that same 50 seconds as experienced in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in different frames, the time experienced can be different. So, 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame is a different duration than in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. So, if the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds, the distance would be larger.\n\nWait, but how do we find t? Because t is the time in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering relativity, so gamma is approximately 1, and the time is taken as 50 seconds. Then, distance would be 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut why is option D 3,060,000 km? That's exactly 60,000 *51. So perhaps the calculation expects a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the relative velocity without any time dilation. Maybe the problem is expecting to use the velocity in the Galaxy's frame and the time in the ejecta's frame, but since the frames are moving, the time experienced is the same. Wait, but that can't be right because moving clocks run slow.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. So, in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. But from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s, and the time is longer due to time dilation.\n\nSo, the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' = (1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) * 50.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects to ignore relativity and use Newtonian physics, where time is the same in both frames. Then, the distance is v * t = 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut given that the problem mentions inertial frames, which are a part of relativity, perhaps the intended solution is to use the relativistic approach.\n\nWait, but the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance would be 60,000 km/s multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nBut the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. So, we need to compute t = gamma * t' = approx 51.03 s.\n\nSo, 60,000 *51.03 \u22483,061,800 km. The options don't have this number, but option D is 3,060,000 km. Close, but not exact.\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects the use of the classical velocity addition, not considering relativity. So, perhaps in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, and the time in the Galaxy's frame is 50 seconds (but that would be wrong because the time is longer due to relativity). Alternatively, perhaps the time is taken as 50 seconds in the Galaxy's frame, but that's not what the question states.\n\nWait, the question says: \"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nSo, the time in the ejecta's frame is 50 s, but how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the distance using the velocity in the Galaxy's frame and the time as observed in the Galaxy's frame. But the problem states the time is 50 s in the ejecta's frame. So, we need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame for this duration.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 s pass in the ejecta's frame. So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer. So, the distance is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nSo, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 \u224851.03 s. So, 60,000 *51.03=3,061,800 km. But none of the options match exactly.\n\nWait, looking at the options again:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm, option D is 3,060,000, which is 60,000 *51. So, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate t as 51 s, using gamma as 1.02.\n\nWait, 1.02 *50=51, which would give 3,060,000. So, perhaps the problem is approximating gamma as 1.02, leading to 51 seconds.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the velocity and the time as 50 seconds in the Galaxy's frame, but that doesn't align with the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply considering relative velocity without time dilation. So, distance is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut I'm a bit torn because the problem says both are inertial frames, which suggests that relativity is in play. But the options don't have the exact value when considering relativity, but D is close.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.04)=1/sqrt(0.96).\n\nsqrt(0.96) is about 0.9798, so gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = 50 * 1.0206 = 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, distance is 60,000 *51.03 \u22483,061,800 km.\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. So, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore relativity and just use 50 seconds, giving 3,000,000 km (option B). But then, the time would be the same, which isn't correct according to relativity.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about relative velocity and the distance in the Galaxy's frame, but without considering time. So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the distance the ejecta travels in 50 seconds as per the Galaxy's frame. But wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut then why is the problem mentioning the reference frames? Because if the time is in the ejecta's frame, but the distance is in the Galaxy's frame, then you need to account for the time difference.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects you to not consider relativity. Let me see: if you take time as 50 seconds, and velocity as 60,000 km/s, then distance is 3,000,000 km. So, option B.\n\nBut then, that would ignore time dilation, which is part of relativity. But the problem statement says to ignore gravity, rotation, etc., but it doesn't say to ignore relativity. So, perhaps the correct approach is to include time dilation, leading to option D.\n\nBut the options don't have exactly 3,061,800 km, but D is 3,060,000, which is very close. So, perhaps the intended answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a straightforward relative velocity problem without considering time dilation. So, in that case, the answer would be B.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the distance the ejecta travels in its own frame. But no, the question says the distance in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck here. But given that the problem mentions inertial frames, it's probably expecting the relativistic approach. So, the correct distance is approximately 3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nThe question says that a supernova occurred in our Galaxy, and part of its ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the key here is probably about relative motion and reference frames. Since both are inertial frames, I don't have to worry about acceleration or anything like that\u2014just constant velocities.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at that speed. But what does that mean in the Galaxy's frame? Oh right, because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Because the frames are moving relative to each other, right?\n\nWait no, actually, wait. If in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy. Because the two frames are moving at that relative velocity. So, the speed is the same but in opposite directions.\n\nSo the question is, how much distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame in a certain time. But wait, the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So the time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. But since the frames are moving, the time experienced in each frame is different. Wait, no, actually, in special relativity, moving clocks run slower, but since the problem says both are inertial and we're dealing with classical mechanics, perhaps we can ignore relativistic effects like time dilation.\n\nWait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. It doesn't mention relativity or anything, so maybe we can treat this as a simple relative velocity problem without considering time dilation or length contraction.\n\nSo, the problem is about the distance in the Galaxy's frame. Let's break it down.\n\nIn the Galaxy's frame (let's call this frame S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. The time we need to find is the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame, but wait, no. Wait, the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame (S'). So how does time in S' relate to time in S?\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during that time. But if the time in S' is 50 seconds, how does that translate to the time in S (Galaxy's frame)?\n\nWait, this might be where I'm getting stuck. Since the frames are moving relative to each other, the time experienced in each frame isn't the same. But again, the problem doesn't mention relativity, so perhaps we're supposed to assume that time is the same in both frames, which would be the case in Newtonian mechanics. But that might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the velocity to calculate the distance, but using the time from the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, because the distance in the Galaxy's frame would depend on the time as observed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to find the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, I need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame corresponding to 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but without knowing the relative velocity, how can I compute the time dilation? Hmm. Let me think. The relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 20% of the speed of light. Hmm, so that's a significant fraction, but not super high.\n\nBut the problem says to ignore gravity and such, but I don't know if it's expecting me to ignore relativity. Because if we don't, then time dilation would affect the calculation.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So, perhaps we are supposed to consider that the time in each frame is different due to their relative motion. So, to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, we need to calculate how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame while 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but how do you compute that? Because in special relativity, moving clocks run slower. So, from the perspective of the Galaxy (S), the ejecta's clock (S') is moving at 60,000 km/s, so it's running slow. So, if 50 seconds pass in S', then in S, more than 50 seconds have passed. Wait, no, because from S's frame, S' is moving, so their own time is the proper time. So, the time in S would be longer.\n\nWait, the time dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So, v is 60,000 km/s. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, let me compute v in terms of c. 60,000 km/s is (60,000 / 300,000) c = 0.2 c.\n\nSo, v = 0.2c. So, beta is 0.2. Then, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96). Hmm, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So, gamma is approximately 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, in the Galaxy's frame, 51.03 seconds pass while 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about how much time passes in S (Galaxy's frame) when S' (ejecta) measures 50 seconds.\n\nWait, the time measured in S is longer than in S' because S' is moving relative to S. So, for events that occur at the same place in S' (like the start and end of the 50 seconds), the time in S would be longer.\n\nSo, the time in S is t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t. Wait, v is the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame, which is 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.03 = let me compute that.\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000. 60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800. So total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Close but not exactly the same. But maybe I approximated gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let's compute beta squared: (0.2)^2 = 0.04. So, 1 - beta^2 = 0.96. The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.9797958971. So, gamma is 1 / 0.9797958971 \u2248 1.020615556.\n\nSo, gamma is approximately 1.020615556. So, t = 50 * 1.020615556 = 51.0307778 seconds.\n\nThen, distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0307778 s = 60,000 * 51.0307778 = let's calculate that.\n\n51.0307778 * 60,000 = ?\n\nWell, 50 * 60,000 = 3,000,000.\n\n1.0307778 * 60,000 = 61,846.6728.\n\nAdding together: 3,000,000 + 61,846.6728 = 3,061,846.6728 km.\n\nSo approximately 3,061,847 km. Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, that's close, but not exact. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the distance in the Galaxy's frame is simply v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. But wait, is v in the same direction as the motion? Yes, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center at v=60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem expects a non-relativistic approach, ignoring time dilation. So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame. Then, the distance would be 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. That's option B.\n\nBut the problem says both are inertial frames, which in relativity they are, but if we ignore relativity, then time is the same in both frames. But the problem doesn't state to ignore relativity; it just says to ignore gravity, rotation, etc.\n\nHmm, this is a bit of a dilemma. The problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem statement says, \"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nSo, in the Galaxy's frame, how much time passes when 50 s pass in the ejecta's frame?\n\nWait, no, the problem says 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during that same 50 seconds as experienced in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in different frames, the time experienced can be different. So, 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame is a different duration than in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. So, if the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds, the distance would be larger.\n\nWait, but how do we find t? Because t is the time in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering relativity, so gamma is approximately 1, and the time is taken as 50 seconds. Then, distance would be 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut why is option D 3,060,000 km? That's exactly 60,000 *51. So perhaps the calculation expects a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the relative velocity without any time dilation. Maybe the problem is expecting to use the velocity in the Galaxy's frame and the time in the ejecta's frame, but since the frames are moving, the time experienced is the same. Wait, but that can't be right because moving clocks run slow.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. So, in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. But from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s, and the time is longer due to time dilation.\n\nSo, the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' = (1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) * 50.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects to ignore relativity and use Newtonian physics, where time is the same in both frames. Then, the distance is v * t = 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut given that the problem mentions inertial frames, which are a part of relativity, perhaps the intended solution is to use the relativistic approach.\n\nWait, but the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance would be 60,000 km/s multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nBut the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. So, we need to compute t = gamma * t' = approx 51.03 s.\n\nSo, 60,000 *51.03 \u22483,061,800 km. The options don't have this number, but option D is 3,060,000 km. Close, but not exact.\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects the use of the classical velocity addition, not considering relativity. So, perhaps in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, and the time in the Galaxy's frame is 50 seconds (but that would be wrong because the time is longer due to relativity). Alternatively, perhaps the time is taken as 50 seconds in the Galaxy's frame, but that's not what the question states.\n\nWait, the question says: \"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nSo, the time in the ejecta's frame is 50 s, but how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the distance using the velocity in the Galaxy's frame and the time as observed in the Galaxy's frame. But the problem states the time is 50 s in the ejecta's frame. So, we need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame for this duration.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 s pass in the ejecta's frame. So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer. So, the distance is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nSo, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 \u224851.03 s. So, 60,000 *51.03=3,061,800 km. But none of the options match exactly.\n\nWait, looking at the options again:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm, option D is 3,060,000, which is 60,000 *51. So, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate t as 51 s, using gamma as 1.02.\n\nWait, 1.02 *50=51, which would give 3,060,000. So, perhaps the problem is approximating gamma as 1.02, leading to 51 seconds.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the velocity and the time as 50 seconds in the Galaxy's frame, but that doesn't align with the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply considering relative velocity without time dilation. So, distance is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut I'm a bit torn because the problem says both are inertial frames, which suggests that relativity is in play. But the options don't have the exact value when considering relativity, but D is close.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.04)=1/sqrt(0.96).\n\nsqrt(0.96) is about 0.9798, so gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = 50 * 1.0206 = 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, distance is 60,000 *51.03 \u22483,061,800 km.\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. So, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore relativity and just use 50 seconds, giving 3,000,000 km (option B). But then, the time would be the same, which isn't correct according to relativity.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about relative velocity and the distance in the Galaxy's frame, but without considering time. So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the distance the ejecta travels in 50 seconds as per the Galaxy's frame. But wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut then why is the problem mentioning the reference frames? Because if the time is in the ejecta's frame, but the distance is in the Galaxy's frame, then you need to account for the time difference.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects you to not consider relativity. Let me see: if you take time as 50 seconds, and velocity as 60,000 km/s, then distance is 3,000,000 km. So, option B.\n\nBut then, that would ignore time dilation, which is part of relativity. But the problem statement says to ignore gravity, rotation, etc., but it doesn't say to ignore relativity. So, perhaps the correct approach is to include time dilation, leading to option D.\n\nBut the options don't have exactly 3,061,800 km, but D is 3,060,000, which is very close. So, perhaps the intended answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a straightforward relative velocity problem without considering time dilation. So, in that case, the answer would be B.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the distance the ejecta travels in its own frame. But no, the question says the distance in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck here. But given that the problem mentions inertial frames, it's probably expecting the relativistic approach. So, the correct distance is approximately 3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the distance the supernova ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame during 50 seconds as measured in the ejecta's reference frame.
