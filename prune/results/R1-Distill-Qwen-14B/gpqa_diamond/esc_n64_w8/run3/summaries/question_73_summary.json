      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to think it through.\n\nThe problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, I guess I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.\n\nWait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the two speeds, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't use the classical formula. I remember something about adding velocities using the Lorentz transformation or a specific formula. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/c\u00b2). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So subtracting them gives 0.1c, but then we have to divide by the factor 1 - (v1 v2)/c\u00b2.\n\nLet me calculate that denominator first. v1*v2 is (0.6c)(0.5c) = 0.3c\u00b2. So 0.3c\u00b2 divided by c\u00b2 is 0.3. So 1 - 0.3 is 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7. Let me compute that: 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue.\n\nNow, the total energy part. The total energy of a relativistic object is given by E = gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So I need to compute the energies of both astronauts and sum them.\n\nFirst astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.\nGamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nSecond astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.\nGamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Hmm, sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so gamma2 is approximately 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c\u00b2 = 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.4641 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.4641 = about 5.9641 m c\u00b2. So the total energy is approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc\u00b2 and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc\u00b2 which is way off. Option B has E=4.96 mc\u00b2 but v_rel=0.1c which we already saw isn't the case. So the correct option should be C.\n\nWait, let me double-check the velocity calculation. v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c\u00b2) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c/0.7 = 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd the energy calculation: for 2m at 0.6c, E1 is 2.5 mc\u00b2. For 3m at 0.5c, E2 is about 3.464 mc\u00b2. Sum is around 5.964 mc\u00b2. So option C matches.\n",

I'm supposed to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.\n\nWait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? Because when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just add or subtract their velocities. I remember there's a formula for the relative velocity in special relativity. Let me recall it. Oh yeah, the formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c\u00b2), but wait, that's when the speeds are in the same direction. So in this case, since both are moving in the positive x-direction, the relative speed would be the difference between their velocities divided by (1 minus the product of the velocities over c squared).\n\nWait, but wait. Oh right, the formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving at u and v in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c\u00b2)). So here, u is 0.6c, and v is 0.5c. So plugging those in: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c\u00b2)). Let me compute that.\n\nThe numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (0.1/0.7) c \u2248 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. That helps narrow down the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option C and D have v_rel=0.14c. So that's the relative speed part done.\n\nNow, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic kinetic energy plus their rest energy. Wait, no, wait. The total energy would be the sum of their individual energies. Each energy is gamma times m c squared. Wait, but wait: each astronaut's energy is their rest mass energy multiplied by gamma. So for each, E = gamma * m_total * c\u00b2. Wait, but their rest masses are 2m and 3m, respectively.\n\nSo for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). So v is 0.6c, so (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)=0.36. 1-0.36=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nFor the second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660. So gamma is 1 / 0.866 \u2248 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately. 3 * 1.1547 is 3.4641. So E2 is approximately 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c\u00b2. So the total energy is approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2, and option D says E=5 mc^2. So the correct total energy is about 5.96 mc\u00b2. So the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations. For the second astronaut, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) \u2248 1.1547. So 3m * 1.1547 is indeed 3.464 m.\n\nYes, and 2m * 1.25 is 2.5 m. Sum is 5.964 m, which rounds to 5.96 mc\u00b2. So the total energy is 5.96 mc\u00b2, and the relative speed is 0.14c.

So option C is correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.\n\n### Relative Speed\nThe relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{u - v}{1 - \\frac{uv}{c^2}}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( u = 0.6c \\) and \\( v = 0.5c \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nThe question says that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The problem is asking for their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds (a significant fraction of the speed of light), we can't just subtract the speeds like we would in classical mechanics. There's a special formula for adding velocities in special relativity. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/c\u00b2). But wait, I need to check which one is moving faster. Oh, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's perspective, astronaut 2 is moving at v2 - v1? Wait no, because in relativity, the relative velocity isn't just a simple subtraction. Let me get the formula right.\n\nSo for astronaut 1, the relative speed of astronaut 2 would be (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c\u00b2)). Wait, but since astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c, but that's classically. Relativistically, we have to use the formula.\n\nWait, no, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c\u00b2)). Wait no, maybe I got it reversed. Let me think. The formula for the relative velocity when moving at speeds u and v relative to the lab frame. Wait, actually, the formula is (u' - v)/(1 - (u'v)/(c\u00b2)) ), where u' is the velocity of the object in the moving frame. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of frames. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that if one object is moving at u and another at v in the same direction, their relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nSo in this case, u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So plugging into the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c\u00b2)). Let's compute numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 0.1c.\n\nDenominator: 1 - (0.3 c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n\nSo v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7)c \u2248 0.1428c. So that's approximately 0.14c, which matches options C and D.\n\nNow, looking at the options, both C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So I need to figure out the total energy.\n\nWait, the problem says 'the total energy of the system.' Hmm, so I think this refers to the rest energy of both astronauts plus their kinetic energy, but in relativity, the total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies.\n\nEach astronaut's total energy is gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for astronaut 1: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.\n\nGamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c\u00b2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.\n\nSo energy1 = gamma1 * 2m c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nAstronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.\n\nGamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) \u2248 1.1547.\n\nEnergy2 = gamma2 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo total energy E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 \u2248 5.964 m c\u00b2.\n\nLooking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc\u00b2, which matches this calculation. Option D says E=5 mc\u00b2, which is lower. So the correct option would be C.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The question says 'the total energy of the system.' I'm assuming each astronaut's rest mass is m, but in the problem statement, astronaut 1 is 2m and astronaut 2 is 3m. So I think I did it right. So 2m * gamma1 + 3m * gamma2.\n\nYes, so 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 m, 3m * 1.1547 \u2248 3.464 m. Sum is 5.964 m.\n\nSo the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the energy is about 5.96 mc\u00b2.\n\nLooking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc\u00b2. So that should be the correct answer.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but wait, when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, I remember that you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nSo the first part is to find the relative speed between the two astronauts. Since they're moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but adjusted for relativity. The formula for adding velocities in relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c\u00b2), but wait, since both are moving in the same direction, maybe I should consider the frame of reference of one astronaut and calculate how fast the other is moving relative to him.\n\nWait, no, the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is (u - v) when using the correct formula. Let me get that right. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The correct formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c\u00b2)), where u is the speed of one object and v is the speed of the other as seen from the stationary frame.\n\nWait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so from A's perspective, B is moving slower. Wait, but wait, the way the formula works, I think I need to plug in the speeds correctly. Let me clarify: if the two objects are moving in the same direction, then the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nWait, no, that's when you're looking at the speed of one relative to the other. So for example, if object 1 is moving at u and object 2 at v (both same direction), then the speed of object 2 as seen from object 1's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c\u00b2)). Wait, no, wait, I think I have that backward. Let me double-check. Suppose u is the speed of the first object, and v is the speed of the second object, both in the same direction. Then, the relative speed of the second from the first's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think of a simple example. If u is 0.8c and v is 0.6c, then the relative speed should be (0.6c - 0.8c)/(1 - (0.8c * 0.6c)/c\u00b2). Wait, but 0.6c - 0.8c is negative, which would imply the second object is moving in the opposite direction, which isn't the case here. Oh wait, no, because if u is the speed of the first object (say, in the lab frame), and v is the speed of the second object (also in the lab frame), then from the first object's frame, the second's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c\u00b2).\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula correctly. The formula for relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)), but I'm getting confused about which is which. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the velocity transformation formula. Suppose the lab frame is S, and the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c in S. So from the perspective of astronaut 2m (let's call him A), what is the speed of astronaut 3m (B) moving at 0.5c in S?\n\nWait, but in the lab frame, both are moving in the same direction. So in the lab frame, B is moving at 0.5c, and A is moving at 0.6c. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?\n\nHmm, the velocity transformation formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)), where v is the speed of the moving frame (A's speed in lab frame) and u is the speed of the object (B) in lab frame.\n\nSo substituting, u = 0.5c, v = 0.6c.\n\nSo u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nCalculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c.\n\nDenominator: 1 - (0.3c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) )= 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n\nSo u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 \u2248 -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction; since we're considering magnitudes, the relative speed is about 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c.\n\nWait, but the options have 0.14c as an option. Let me check the options again. Option C says v_rel=0.14c, and E=5.96 mc\u00b2. Option D is 0.14c and E=5mc\u00b2. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part is the total energy of the system. Wait, in relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of the rest energies plus kinetic energies. Because each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc\u00b2.\n\nSo the total energy of the system would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut.\n\nSo for astronaut A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.\n\nGamma factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.\n\nSo his energy is gamma * m_total * c\u00b2.

So the correct option would be C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the astronauts. Oh, the question says \"the total energy of the system.\" So yes, each contributes their own energy, which I calculated correctly.\n\nSo the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc\u00b2.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but wait, when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, I remember that you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nSo the first part is to find the relative speed between the two astronauts. Since they're moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but adjusted for relativity. The formula for adding velocities in relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c\u00b2), but wait, since both are moving in the same direction, maybe I should consider the frame of reference of one astronaut and calculate how fast the other is moving relative to him.\n\nWait, no, the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is (u - v) when using the correct formula. Let me get that right. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The correct formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c\u00b2)), where u is the speed of one object and v is the speed of the other as seen from the stationary frame.\n\nWait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so from A's perspective, B is moving slower. Wait, but wait, the way the formula works, I think I need to plug in the speeds correctly. Let me clarify: if the two objects are moving in the same direction, then the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nWait, no, that's when you're looking at the speed of one relative to the other. So for example, if object 1 is moving at u and object 2 at v (both same direction), then the speed of object 2 as seen from object 1's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c\u00b2)). Wait, no, wait, I think I have that backward. Let me double-check. Suppose u is the speed of the first object, and v is the speed of the second object, both in the same direction. Then, the relative speed of the second from the first's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think of a simple example. If u is 0.8c and v is 0.6c, then the relative speed should be (0.6c - 0.8c)/(1 - (0.8c * 0.6c)/c\u00b2). Wait, but 0.6c - 0.8c is negative, which would imply the second object is moving in the opposite direction, which isn't the case here. Oh wait, no, because if u is the speed of the first object (say, in the lab frame), and v is the speed of the second object (also in the lab frame), then from the first object's frame, the second's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c\u00b2).\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula correctly. The formula for relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)), but I'm getting confused about which is which. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the velocity transformation formula. Suppose the lab frame is S, and the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c in S. So from the perspective of astronaut 2m (let's call him A), what is the speed of astronaut 3m (B) moving at 0.5c in S?\n\nWait, but in the lab frame, both are moving in the same direction. So in the lab frame, B is moving at 0.5c, and A is moving at 0.6c. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?\n\nHmm, the velocity transformation formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)), where v is the speed of the moving frame (A's speed in lab frame) and u is the speed of the object (B) in lab frame.\n\nSo substituting, u = 0.5c, v = 0.6c.\n\nSo u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nCalculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c.\n\nDenominator: 1 - (0.3c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) )= 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n\nSo u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 \u2248 -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction; since we're considering magnitudes, the relative speed is about 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c.\n\nWait, but the options have 0.14c as an option. Let me check the options again. Option C says v_rel=0.14c, and E=5.96 mc\u00b2. Option D is 0.14c and E=5mc\u00b2. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part is the total energy of the system. Wait, in relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of the rest energies plus kinetic energies. Because each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc\u00b2.\n\nSo the total energy of the system would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut.\n\nSo for astronaut A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.\n\nGamma factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.\n\nSo his energy is gamma * m_total * c\u00b2. Wait, wait, the astronaut's mass is 2m, so E_A = gamma * (2m) c\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, for astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.\n\nGamma for B: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) \u2248 1.1547.\n\nSo E_B = gamma * (3m) c\u00b2 \u2248 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.4641 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo total energy E_total = E_A + E_B.\n\nE_A = 2m * 1.25 c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nE_B = 3m * 1.1547 c\u00b2 \u2248 3.4641 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding them together: 2.5 + 3.4641 = approximately 5.9641 m c\u00b2.\n\nLooking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc\u00b2, which matches this.\n\nSo the options for relative speed are 0.14c (options C and D), and energy is about 5.96 mc\u00b2 (option C).

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem states that there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relative speeds at relativistic velocities, we can't just subtract the speeds like we do in classical mechanics. Oh right, because of the theory of relativity, specifically the velocity addition formula.\n\nWait, so how does that work again? Oh, right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. If an observer in one frame sees object A moving at u and object B moving at v, then the relative speed of B with respect to A is given by (v - u) divided by (1 - (u*v)/(c\u00b2)). But wait, wait. Let me make sure I get that right. Because if both are moving in the same direction, then the relative speed would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c\u00b2) if u is the speed of the first object and v the second. Wait, no, I think I mixed that up. Let me think: if object A is moving at u and object B is moving at v (same direction), then from A's frame, B's speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c\u00b2), but wait, actually no, the correct formula is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nWait, actually, the formula for the relative velocity is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c\u00b2)), right? Because if you're in a frame moving at u, then you see the other object moving at (v - u) but you have to account for the relativity of simultaneity and the contraction. So, in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So, from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nLet me compute that. The numerator is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7, which is approximately -0.1428c. Since speed is positive, it's about 0.14c. Wait, but the options have 0.14c as an option, like in option C and D.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I should think about which astronaut's frame we're calculating the relative speed from. The problem says \"relative speed\", so I think it's the speed of one as seen from the other. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So the relative speed of the second from the first's frame would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c\u00b2)) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 \u2248 -0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c, but wait, the question says \"relative speed\"\u2014so perhaps it's the magnitude, so 0.14c. So looking at the options, C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.\n\nNow, moving on to the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. But wait, the masses here are 2m and 3m. So I'll have to calculate each's energy and sum them.\n\nSo for the first astronaut, moving at 0.6c: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is gamma * 2m * c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nSecond astronaut at 0.5c: gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) \u2248 1.1547. So their energy is gamma * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c\u00b2, which is approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2. Wait, but looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc\u00b2, and option D has E=5 mc\u00b2.\n\nSo the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is about 5.96 mc\u00b2. So looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc\u00b2. So option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the velocities. Wait, when calculating relative velocity, I took the first astronaut's frame as the observer. So the second astronaut is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c\u00b2) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1/0.7) c \u2248 -0.1428c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. That seems correct.\n\nAnd the energy calculation: the first astronaut's energy is gamma = 1.25, so 2m *1.25 c\u00b2= 2.5 mc\u00b2. The second's gamma is about 1.1547, so 3m *1.1547 c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 mc\u00b2. Summing gives 5.964 mc\u00b2, which is option C's E.\n\nWait, but another thought: when considering the total energy, should it be the sum of their rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies? No, wait, the total energy includes rest mass and kinetic. So the calculation I did is correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc\u00b2.\n",

So the relative speed of the second from the first's frame would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c\u00b2)) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 \u2248 -0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c, but wait, the question says \"relative speed\"\u2014so perhaps it's the magnitude, so 0.14c. So looking at the options, C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.\n\nNow, moving on to the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. But wait, the masses here are 2m and 3m. So I'll have to calculate each's energy and sum them.\n\nSo for the first astronaut, moving at 0.6c: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is gamma * 2m * c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nSecond astronaut at 0.5c: gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) \u2248 1.1547. So their energy is gamma * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c\u00b2, which is approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2. Wait, but looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc\u00b2, and option D has E=5 mc\u00b2.\n\nSo the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is about 5.96 mc\u00b2. So looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc\u00b2. So option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the velocities. Wait, when calculating relative velocity, I took the first astronaut's frame as the observer. So the second astronaut is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c\u00b2) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1/0.7) c \u2248 -0.1428c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. That seems correct.\n\nAnd the energy calculation: the first astronaut's energy is gamma = 1.25, so 2m *1.25 c\u00b2= 2.5 mc\u00b2. The second's gamma is about 1.1547, so 3m *1.1547 c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 mc\u00b2. Summing gives 5.964 mc\u00b2, which is option C's E.\n\nWait, but another thought: when considering the total energy, should it be the sum of their rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies? No, wait, the total energy includes rest mass and kinetic. So the calculation I did is correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc\u00b2.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.\n\n### Step 1: Relative Speed\nThe relative speed of one object with respect to another at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{v - u}{1 - \\frac{vu}{c^2}}\n\\]\n\nHere, the first astronaut (mass \\(2m\\)) is moving at \\(u = 0.6c\\), and the second astronaut (mass \\(3m\\)) is moving at \\(v = 0.5c\\), both in the same direction.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.\n\nWait, wait. So the first part is about relative speed. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. I remember that the formula for adding velocities is different. Oh yeah, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c\u00b2)). But wait, which way are they moving? Both are moving in the positive x-direction, so from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c\u00b2)), right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, because if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference of their speeds. But using the relativistic formula. So v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c\u00b2). Let me plug in the numbers.\n\nv1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2). The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c\u00b2)/c\u00b2. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c)/0.7 = (1/7) c \u2248 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. That matches option C and D.\n\nNow, the second part is the total energy. Hmm. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c\u00b2. So I need to calculate the energy for each and sum them.\n\nWait, wait. The astronauts' masses are 2m and 3m. So for the first, mass is 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). So for v=0.6c, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 is 1.25 * 2m * c\u00b2 = 2.5 mc\u00b2.\n\nFor the second astronaut, mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Square root is about 0.8660. So gamma is 1 / 0.8660 \u2248 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2. Let me calculate that: 1.1547 * 3 \u2248 3.464 mc\u00b2.\n\nSo total energy E_total is E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 \u2248 5.964 mc\u00b2. That's about 5.96 mc\u00b2. Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc\u00b2 and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5mc\u00b2, which is less. So the correct option should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation for E2. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(4/3) \u2248 1.1547. So 1.1547 * 3m = 3.4641 m. So 3.4641 m c\u00b2. So yes, E1 is 2.5 and E2 is 3.4641, sum to about 5.9641 mc\u00b2. So option C's E is 5.96, which matches.\n\nSo the relative speed is about 0.14c and the total energy is ~5.96 mc\u00b2. So the correct answer is option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to work through this.\n\nSo the question is asking about the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D. I need to find which one is correct.\n\nFirst, the masses are given as 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but in relativity, when we talk about relative speeds, especially at significant fractions of the speed of light, we can't just subtract the speeds normally. Oh right, because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. So I can't just say 0.6c minus 0.5c equals 0.1c because that's not how it works at high speeds.\n\nWait, wait, the velocity addition formula in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c\u00b2). Oh wait no, wait: when two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of one with respect to the other isn't just u - v. Because velocities don't add linearly in relativity. So for object A moving at u and object B at v (same direction), the relative speed of B from A's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c\u00b2). Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c\u00b2)). Let me think: if u is the velocity of A as seen from the lab, and v is the velocity of B as seen from lab, then from A's frame, B is moving at (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c\u00b2)).\n\nWait, let me get that right. The velocity of B in A's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c\u00b2). Because from A's perspective, they're stationary and B is moving. Wait, no, I think it's (v - u) divided by (1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)). Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of it this way: when you have two velocities u and v in the same direction, the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)). Let's plug in the numbers.\n\nSo u is 0.6c (the faster one), v is 0.5c. So (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c. Then denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2. Let's compute that: (0.3 c\u00b2)/c\u00b2 is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.143c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel around 0.14c. So that's a hint.\n\nSo the relative speed is about 0.14c, which would eliminate options A and B. Because A has 1.1c, which is impossible, since speeds can't exceed c. So A is out. B has 0.1c, which is what you'd get if you just subtracted, but relativity doesn't allow that. So B's relative speed is wrong. So now it's between C and D.\n\nNext, let's tackle the total energy of the system. The system is the two astronauts. So the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), their gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nFor the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) \u2248 1.1547. So their energy is approximately 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c\u00b2. Which is approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2. Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc\u00b2, and option D says E=5 mc\u00b2. So the correct energy is around 5.96, so option C is the one.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says \"the total energy of the system.\" Does that mean the sum of their rest energies plus kinetic? Or is it their relativistic energies including kinetic? Because in relativity, the energy includes rest mass plus kinetic. So yes, adding their gamma m c\u00b2 values is correct.\n\nSo looking at the options:\n\nOption C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc\u00b2. That matches both the relative speed and the energy.\n\nOption D has E=5mc\u00b2, which is about 2.5 + 2.5 =5, but wait, the second astronaut has 3m, so 3*1.1547 is about 3.46, not 2.5. So no, option D's energy is too low.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to work through this.\n\nSo the question is asking about the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D. I need to find which one is correct.\n\nFirst, the masses are given as 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but in relativity, when we talk about relative speeds, especially at significant fractions of the speed of light, we can't just subtract the speeds normally. Oh right, because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. So I can't just say 0.6c minus 0.5c equals 0.1c because that's not how it works at high speeds.\n\nWait, wait, the velocity addition formula in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c\u00b2). Oh wait no, wait: when two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of one with respect to the other isn't just u - v. Because velocities don't add linearly in relativity. So for object A moving at u and object B at v (same direction), the relative speed of B from A's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c\u00b2). Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c\u00b2)). Let me think: if u is the velocity of A as seen from the lab, and v is the velocity of B as seen from lab, then from A's frame, B is moving at (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c\u00b2)).\n\nWait, let me get that right. The velocity of B in A's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c\u00b2). Because from A's perspective, they're stationary and B is moving. Wait, no, I think it's (v - u) divided by (1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)). Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of it this way: when you have two velocities u and v in the same direction, the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)). Let's plug in the numbers.\n\nSo u is 0.6c (the faster one), v is 0.5c. So (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c. Then denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2. Let's compute that: (0.3 c\u00b2)/c\u00b2 is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.143c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel around 0.14c. So that's a hint.\n\nSo the relative speed is about 0.14c, which would eliminate options A and B. Because A has 1.1c, which is impossible, since speeds can't exceed c. So A is out. B has 0.1c, which is what you'd get if you just subtracted, but relativity doesn't allow that. So B's relative speed is wrong. So now it's between C and D.\n\nNext, let's tackle the total energy of the system. The system is the two astronauts. So the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), their gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nFor the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) \u2248 1.1547. So their energy is approximately 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c\u00b2. Which is approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2. Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc\u00b2, and option D says E=5 mc\u00b2. So the correct energy is around 5.96, so option C is the one.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says \"the total energy of the system.\" Does that mean the sum of their rest energies plus kinetic? Or is it their relativistic energies including kinetic? Because in relativity, the energy includes rest mass plus kinetic. So yes, adding their gamma m c\u00b2 values is correct.\n\nSo looking at the options:\n\nOption C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc\u00b2. That matches both the relative speed and the energy.\n\nOption D has E=5mc\u00b2, which is about 2.5 + 2.5 =5, but wait, the second astronaut has 3m, so 3*1.1547 is about 3.46, not 2.5. So no, option D's energy is too low.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.\n\n### Step 1: Relative Speed\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities \\( u \\) and \\( v \\), the relative speed is given by:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{u - v}{1 - \\frac{uv}{c^2}}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( u = 0.6c \\) and \\( v = 0.5c \\). Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} \\approx 0.14c\n\\]\n\nThus, the relative speed is approximately \\( 0.14c \\).\n\n### Step 2: Total Energy of the System\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:\n\n\\[\nE = \\gamma mc^2, \\quad \\text{where } \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\\]\n\nFor the first astronaut (mass \\( 2m \\), speed \\( 0.6c \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\n\\]\n\\[\nE_1 = \\gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \\cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\n\\]\n\nFor the second astronaut (mass \\( 3m \\), speed \\( 0.5c \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547\n\\]\n\\[\nE_2 = \\gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \\cdot 3m c^2 \\approx 3.464m c^2\n\\]\n\nThe total energy of the system is:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \\approx 5.96m c^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Matching with Options\nFrom the calculations:\n- The relative speed is \\( v_{\\text{rel}} \\approx 0.14c \\), which matches options C and D.\n- The total energy is \\( E_{\\text{total}} \\approx 5.96m c^2 \\), which matches option C.\n\nOption D incorrectly states the total energy as \\( 5m c^2 \\), which is too low. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

The question is asking about their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

I think the first part is finding the relative speed between them, and the second part is finding the total energy of the system.\n\nWait, relative speed in relativity. Oh right, you can't just subtract the speeds. You have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c\u00b2)). Wait, or is it the other way around? Because if the second object is moving at v2 relative to the first, then the relative speed would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c\u00b2). Wait, no, I think when you're in the frame of the first object, the second's speed is (v2 - v1)/(1 - v1 v2/c\u00b2) or something like that. Let me get this straight.\n\nWait, the velocity addition formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)) when moving from the frame where the second object has velocity u to a frame moving at velocity v. So if the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c in the same direction, then in the first astronaut's frame, the second is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nLet me compute that. The numerator is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.1428c. Since speed is positive, it's 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, which would correspond to either option C or D for the relative speed part.\n\nNow for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy. The formula is E = gamma * m c\u00b2. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):\n\nGamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.\n\nSo E1 = 2m * 1.25 c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nWait wait, wait. Wait, no. Gamma is multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is m0 c\u00b2. So for the first astronaut, m0 is 2m. So E1 = gamma1 * (2m c\u00b2) = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2. Right.\n\nSecond astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.\n\nGamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) \u2248 1.1547.\n\nE2 = gamma2 * (3m c\u00b2) = 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nTotal energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c\u00b2. Which is approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2. Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2. Option D says E=5mc^2.\n\nSo the total energy is about 5.96 mc\u00b2. The relative speed is about 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the velocity calculation. The relative speed is from the perspective of the first astronaut. The second astronaut is moving at 0.5c, first at 0.6c. So in the first's frame, the second is approaching at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/c\u00b2) = (-0.1c)/(1 -0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 \u2248 -0.1428c. So the speed is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So relative speed is 0.14c.\n\nSo the correct answer would have v_rel=0.14c and E\u22485.96 mc\u00b2. So option C is the correct one.\n",

The numerator is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.1428c.
