      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they usually produce photons. Since they're moving towards each other, their collision must involve some conservation laws.\n\nWait, the question says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. Oh wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, which is the factor by which time and lengths dilate in special relativity. But how does that relate to their momenta?\n\nI think I should find the total energy and momentum before the collision. Because in any collision, the total energy and momentum are conserved.\n\nSo, for the electron: Its Lorentz factor gamma is 4. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So the total energy of the electron would be gamma * m_e c\u00b2, which is 4 * 0.511 = 2.044 MeV. Same for the positron, but its gamma is 2, so its energy is 2 * 0.511 = 1.022 MeV.\n\nWait, but since the positron is moving from the right, its direction is opposite to the electron. So their momenta would be in opposite directions. So I need to consider the signs.\n\nThe momentum p is gamma * m_e * v. But wait, another way is to calculate p in terms of energy. For relativistic particles, E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2. So p = sqrt( (E/c\u00b2)\u00b2 - (m_e c\u00b2)^2 ) / c. Wait, no, let me rearrange that. E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. So (pc)^2 = E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2. So p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2) ) / c\u00b2? Wait, maybe I should just compute it for each particle.\n\nWait, electron: E_e = 4 * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV. So p_e c = sqrt( (2.044)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) * (0.511) MeV. Wait, no, perhaps better to compute in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity. Or maybe calculate each term step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since gamma = E/(m c\u00b2), so E = gamma m c\u00b2. So for the electron, E_e = 4 m c\u00b2. Similarly, E_p = 2 m c\u00b2.\n\nNow, the momentum p for each is given by p = gamma m v. But v is related to gamma as v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Wait, another approach: since E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2, so (pc) = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ). Let me compute that for each.\n\nElectron:\nE_e = 4 m c\u00b2\npc_e = sqrt( (4 m c\u00b2)^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) = sqrt(16 m\u00b2 c^4 - m\u00b2 c^4 ) = sqrt(15 m\u00b2 c^4 ) = m c\u00b2 sqrt(15)\nSo p_e = (m c\u00b2 sqrt(15)) / c\u00b2 = m sqrt(15) / c.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express that. Let me compute pc for each:\n\nElectron:\npc_e = sqrt( (4 m c\u00b2)^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) = sqrt(16 m\u00b2 c^4 - m\u00b2 c^4 ) = sqrt(15 m\u00b2 c^4 ) = m c\u00b2 sqrt(15)\nSo p_e = (m c\u00b2 sqrt(15)) / c\u00b2 ) = m sqrt(15) / c. Wait, but actually, since pc_e is m c\u00b2 sqrt(15), then p_e = (m c\u00b2 sqrt(15)) / c\u00b2 = m sqrt(15) / c. Hmm, but I think the direction matters. Since the electron is moving left to right (from the left), and the positron is moving right to left (from the right), their momenta are in opposite directions. So when calculating the total momentum, we need to consider their signs.\n\nSo for the electron, moving to the right, p_e is positive. The positron is moving to the left, so p_p is negative.\n\nSo p_e = m sqrt(15) / c. The positron's E_p is 2 m c\u00b2.\n\npc_p = sqrt( (2 m c\u00b2)^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) = sqrt(4 m\u00b2 c^4 - m\u00b2 c^4 ) = sqrt(3 m\u00b2 c^4 ) = m c\u00b2 sqrt(3)\nSo p_p = (m c\u00b2 sqrt(3)) / c\u00b2 = m sqrt(3)/c. But since it's moving left, p_p is negative.\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p = (m sqrt(15)/c) - (m sqrt(3)/c ) = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / c.\n\nBut wait, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) is about 2.14. So the total momentum is positive, meaning the direction is to the right.\n\nNow, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon, same for both, and their directions are measured. One is upper-right, the other lower-right. So their angles are symmetric about the horizontal axis, perhaps? Or maybe not exactly symmetric, but the problem states that their energies are the same. So each photon has energy E_photon.\n\nSince photons carry momentum, their momenta are E_photon / c, because for photons, E = pc. Wait, because for a photon, E = pc, so p_photon = E/(c). So each photon's momentum is E_ph/(c).\n\nBut since the two photons have the same energy, their momenta magnitudes are the same. Now, the direction is upper-right and lower-right. So their angles from the horizontal axis would be symmetric, say theta above and theta below the horizontal. So the angle between them would be 2 theta.\n\nWait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their angles from the x-axis (horizontal) would be +theta and -theta. So the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nBut wait, the total momentum after the collision must equal the total momentum before. So the sum of the two photons' momenta vectors should equal the initial total momentum.\n\nThe initial total momentum is P_initial = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / c.\n\nNow, the two photons' momenta vectors are p1 and p2. Since the photons have same energy, same |p|, and their directions are symmetric across the x-axis. So if each has magnitude p, then their vector sum is (p cos theta + p cos theta, p sin theta - p sin theta) = (2 p cos theta, 0). Wait, but that would only be the case if the two photons are moving in exactly opposite y-directions, but same x-components. But that would give a total momentum along x-axis. But in our case, the initial momentum is along the x-axis. So that's possible.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial total momentum is along the x-axis. So the sum of the two photons' momenta must also be along the x-axis. So any y-components must cancel out. So for the two photons, their y-components must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So the angle theta for each photon would be such that their y-components are equal and opposite.\n\nWait, but the problem states that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So their y-components are in opposite directions. So if one is at angle theta above the x-axis, the other is at angle theta below. So their y-components are p sin(theta) and -p sin(theta), which sum to zero. Their x-components sum to 2 p cos(theta).\n\nSo the total momentum after is (2 p cos(theta), 0). This must equal the initial momentum, which is along x-axis, P_initial = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / c.\n\nSo, 2 p cos(theta) = P_initial.\n\nBut each photon has energy E_ph, so their momentum is p_ph = E_ph / c. So for each photon, p = E_ph / c.\n\nThus, 2 (E_ph / c) cos(theta) = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / c.\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\n2 E_ph cos(theta) = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, also, the total energy after collision is the sum of the two photons' energies, which is 2 E_ph. But the initial total energy is the sum of the electron and positron energies: E_initial = 4 m c\u00b2 + 2 m c\u00b2 = 6 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo 2 E_ph = 6 m c\u00b2 \u2192 E_ph = 3 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo substituting back into the momentum equation:\n\n2 * (3 m c\u00b2) * cos(theta) = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m c\u00b2 cos(theta) = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\n6 c\u00b2 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nWait, but wait, m is the rest mass of the electron, and c is speed of light. The units are a bit messy, but since we're dealing with ratios, perhaps it's okay.\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake. Because E_ph is in units of energy, and the right-hand side is m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), but m is in kg, so perhaps the equation is correct dimensionally.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the dimensions. The left side is 6 c\u00b2 cos(theta) * m. Because E_ph is 3 m c\u00b2, so 2 E_ph is 6 m c\u00b2. So 6 m c\u00b2 cos(theta) equals m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but the right side is m multiplied by (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), which is dimensionless. So 6 c\u00b2 cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, no. Because in the equation:\n\n6 m c\u00b2 cos(theta) = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\n6 c\u00b2 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / (6 c\u00b2).\n\nWait, but wait, c is a constant, so perhaps I should have considered natural units where c=1. Because in equations involving E and p, when c=1, E and p have the same units.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the units earlier. Let's try to redo this using natural units where c=1. Then, the equations simplify.\n\nIn natural units, c=1, so E = gamma m, and p = gamma m v. But v for a particle is given by v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Alternatively, since E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m\u00b2.\n\nSo for the electron:\n\nE_e = 4 m_e.\n\np_e = sqrt( (4 m_e)^2 - m_e^2 ) = sqrt(16 m_e^2 - m_e^2 ) = sqrt(15) m_e.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, E_p = 2 m_e.\n\np_p = sqrt( (2 m_e)^2 - m_e^2 ) = sqrt(4 m_e^2 - m_e^2 ) = sqrt(3) m_e.\n\nBut the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so p_p = - sqrt(3) m_e.\n\nTotal initial momentum P_initial = p_e + p_p = sqrt(15) m_e - sqrt(3) m_e = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, after the collision, two photons are produced, each with energy E_ph. Since the photons are moving in opposite y-directions, their momenta vectors are (E_ph, theta) and (E_ph, -theta) in polar coordinates. So their x-components are E_ph cos(theta) each, and y-components are E_ph sin(theta) and -E_ph sin(theta) respectively.\n\nTotal momentum after collision:\n\np_x = E_ph cos(theta) + E_ph cos(theta) = 2 E_ph cos(theta)\np_y = E_ph sin(theta) - E_ph sin(theta) = 0.\n\nSo the total momentum is (2 E_ph cos(theta), 0).\n\nThis must equal the initial momentum, which is m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction. So:\n\n2 E_ph cos(theta) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nTotal energy after collision is 2 E_ph. The initial energy is E_e + E_p = 4 m_e + 2 m_e = 6 m_e.\n\nSo 2 E_ph = 6 m_e \u2192 E_ph = 3 m_e.\n\nSubstituting back into the momentum equation:\n\n2 * 3 m_e * cos(theta) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m_e cos(theta) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m_e:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n\nNow, compute the value of this.\n\nCalculate sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298, sqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos(theta) \u2248 0.35682.\n\nNow, find theta in degrees: theta \u2248 arccos(0.35682).\n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.35682) is approximately 69 degrees.\n\nWait, wait, cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.3420. So 0.3568 is between 69 and 70 degrees. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nLet me calculate for 69 degrees:\n\ncos(69) \u2248 0.3584.\n\nOur value is 0.3568, which is a bit lower. So theta is slightly larger than 69 degrees. Let's say approximately 69.2 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me use a calculator to find it more precisely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using a calculator:\n\nUsing calculator, cos(69 degrees) is approximately 0.3584.\n\nOur value is 0.3568, which is a bit lower. So the angle is a bit larger than 69 degrees.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nAt 69.2 degrees: cos(69.2) \u2248 ?\n\nWell, each degree is about 0.01745 radians.\n\n69 degrees is 1.204 radians.\n\n0.2 degrees is 0.00349 radians.\n\nSo 69.2 degrees is 1.204 + 0.00349 \u2248 1.2075 radians.\n\ncos(1.2075) \u2248 cos(69.2\u00b0) \u2248 0.3568.\n\nYes, that's about right.\n\nSo theta \u2248 69.2 degrees.\n\nSo each photon is at about 69.2 degrees above and below the x-axis. The angle between them is 2 theta, which is about 138.4 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is 138. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 74\n\nB) 172\n\nC) 138\n\nD) 96.\n\nSo the angle between the photons is 2 theta \u2248 138 degrees, which matches option C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, followed by the annihilation into two photons.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they usually produce photons.

So the total energy of the electron would be gamma * m_e c\u00b2, which is 4 * 0.511 = 2.044 MeV. Same for the positron, but its gamma is 2, so its energy is 2 * 0.511 = 1.022 MeV.\n\nWait, but since the positron is moving from the right, its direction is opposite to the electron. So their momenta would be in opposite directions. So I need to consider the signs.\n\nThe momentum p is gamma * m_e * v. But wait, another way is to calculate p in terms of energy. For relativistic particles, E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2. So p = sqrt( (E/c\u00b2)\u00b2 - (m_e c\u00b2)^2 ) / c. Wait, no, let me rearrange that. E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. So (pc)^2 = E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2. So p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2) ) / c\u00b2? Wait, maybe I should just compute it for each particle.\n\nWait, electron: E_e = 4 * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV. So p_e c = sqrt( (2.044)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) * (0.511) MeV. Wait, no, perhaps better to compute in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity. Or maybe calculate each term step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since gamma = E/(m c\u00b2), so E = gamma m c\u00b2. So for the electron, E_e = 4 m c\u00b2. Similarly, E_p = 2 m c\u00b2.\n\nNow, the momentum p for each is given by p = gamma m v. But v is related to gamma as v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Wait, another approach: since E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2, so (pc) = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ). Let me compute that for each.\n\nElectron:\nE_e = 4 m c\u00b2\npc_e = sqrt( (4 m c\u00b2)^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) = sqrt(16 m\u00b2 c^4 - m\u00b2 c^4 ) = sqrt(15 m\u00b2 c^4 ) = m c\u00b2 sqrt(15)\nSo p_e = (m c\u00b2 sqrt(15)) / c\u00b2 = m sqrt(15) / c.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express that. Let me compute pc for each:\n\nElectron:\npc_e = sqrt( (4 m c\u00b2)^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) = sqrt(16 m\u00b2 c^4 - m\u00b2 c^4 ) = sqrt(15 m\u00b2 c^4 ) = m c\u00b2 sqrt(15)\nSo p_e = (m c\u00b2 sqrt(15)) / c\u00b2 ) = m sqrt(15) / c. Wait, but actually, since pc_e is m c\u00b2 sqrt(15), then p_e = (m c\u00b2 sqrt(15)) / c\u00b2 = m sqrt(15) / c. Hmm, but I think the direction matters. Since the electron is moving left to right (from the left), and the positron is moving right to left (from the right), their momenta are in opposite directions. So when calculating the total momentum, we need to consider their signs.\n\nSo for the electron, moving to the right, p_e is positive. The positron is moving to the left, so p_p is negative.\n\nSo p_e = m sqrt(15) / c. The positron's E_p is 2 m c\u00b2.\n\npc_p = sqrt( (2 m c\u00b2)^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) = sqrt(4 m\u00b2 c^4 - m\u00b2 c^4 ) = sqrt(3 m\u00b2 c^4 ) = m c\u00b2 sqrt(3)\nSo p_p = (m c\u00b2 sqrt(3)) / c\u00b2 = m sqrt(3)/c. But since it's moving left, p_p is negative.\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p = (m sqrt(15)/c) - (m sqrt(3)/c ) = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / c.\n\nBut wait, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) is about 2.14. So the total momentum is positive, meaning the direction is to the right.\n\nNow, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon, same for both, and their directions are measured. One is upper-right, the other lower-right. So their angles are symmetric about the horizontal axis, perhaps? Or maybe not exactly symmetric, but the problem states that their energies are the same. So each photon has energy E_photon.\n\nSince photons carry momentum, their momenta are E_photon / c, because for photons, E = pc. Wait, because for a photon, E = pc, so p_photon = E/(c). So each photon's momentum is E_ph/(c).\n\nBut since the two photons have the same energy, their momenta magnitudes are the same. Now, the direction is upper-right and lower-right. So their angles from the horizontal axis would be symmetric, say theta above and theta below the horizontal. So the angle between them would be 2 theta.\n\nWait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their angles from the x-axis (horizontal) would be +theta and -theta. So the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nBut wait, the total momentum after the collision must equal the total momentum before. So the sum of the two photons' momenta vectors should equal the initial total momentum.\n\nThe initial total momentum is P_initial = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / c.\n\nNow, the two photons' momenta vectors are p1 and p2. Since the photons have same energy, same |p|, and their directions are symmetric across the x-axis. So if each has magnitude p, then their vector sum is (p cos theta + p cos theta, p sin theta - p sin theta) = (2 p cos theta, 0). Wait, but that would only be the case if the two photons are moving in exactly opposite y-directions, but same x-components. But that would give a total momentum along x-axis. But in our case, the initial momentum is along the x-axis. So that's possible.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial total momentum is along the x-axis. So the sum of the two photons' momenta must also be along the x-axis. So any y-components must cancel out. So for the two photons, their y-components must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So the angle theta for each photon would be such that their y-components are equal and opposite.\n\nWait, but the problem states that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So their y-components are in opposite directions. So if one is at angle theta above the x-axis, the other is at angle theta below. So their y-components are p sin(theta) and -p sin(theta), which sum to zero. Their x-components sum to 2 p cos(theta).\n\nSo the total momentum after is (2 p cos(theta), 0). This must equal the initial momentum, which is along x-axis, P_initial = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / c.\n\nSo, 2 p cos(theta) = P_initial.\n\nBut each photon has energy E_ph, so their momentum is p_ph = E_ph / c. So for each photon, p = E_ph / c.\n\nThus, 2 (E_ph / c) cos(theta) = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / c.\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\n2 E_ph cos(theta) = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, also, the total energy after collision is the sum of the two photons' energies, which is 2 E_ph. But the initial total energy is the sum of the electron and positron energies: E_initial = 4 m c\u00b2 + 2 m c\u00b2 = 6 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo 2 E_ph = 6 m c\u00b2 \u2192 E_ph = 3 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo substituting back into the momentum equation:\n\n2 * (3 m c\u00b2) * cos(theta) = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m c\u00b2 cos(theta) = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\n6 c\u00b2 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nWait, but wait, m is the rest mass of the electron, and c is speed of light. The units are a bit messy, but since we're dealing with ratios, perhaps it's okay.\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake. Because E_ph is in units of energy, and the right-hand side is m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), but m is in kg, so perhaps the equation is correct dimensionally.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the dimensions. The left side is 6 c\u00b2 cos(theta) * m. Because E_ph is 3 m c\u00b2, so 2 E_ph is 6 m c\u00b2. So 6 m c\u00b2 cos(theta) equals m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but the right side is m multiplied by (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), which is dimensionless. So 6 c\u00b2 cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, no. Because in the equation:\n\n6 m c\u00b2 cos(theta) = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\n6 c\u00b2 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / (6 c\u00b2).\n\nWait, but wait, c is a constant, so perhaps I should have considered natural units where c=1. Because in equations involving E and p, when c=1, E and p have the same units.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the units earlier. Let's try to redo this using natural units where c=1. Then, the equations simplify.\n\nIn natural units, c=1, so E = gamma m, and p = gamma m v. But v for a particle is given by v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Alternatively, since E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m\u00b2.\n\nSo for the electron:\n\nE_e = 4 m_e.\n\np_e = sqrt( (4 m_e)^2 - m_e^2 ) = sqrt(16 m_e^2 - m_e^2 ) = sqrt(15) m_e.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, E_p = 2 m_e.\n\np_p = sqrt( (2 m_e)^2 - m_e^2 ) = sqrt(4 m_e^2 - m_e^2 ) = sqrt(3) m_e.\n\nBut the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so p_p = - sqrt(3) m_e.\n\nTotal initial momentum P_initial = p_e + p_p = sqrt(15) m_e - sqrt(3) m_e = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, after the collision, two photons are produced, each with energy E_ph. Since the photons are moving in opposite y-directions, their momenta vectors are (E_ph, theta) and (E_ph, -theta) in polar coordinates. So their x-components are E_ph cos(theta) each, and y-components are E_ph sin(theta) and -E_ph sin(theta) respectively.\n\nTotal momentum after collision:\n\np_x = E_ph cos(theta) + E_ph cos(theta) = 2 E_ph cos(theta)\np_y = E_ph sin(theta) - E_ph sin(theta) = 0.\n\nSo the total momentum is (2 E_ph cos(theta), 0).\n\nThis must equal the initial momentum, which is m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction. So:\n\n2 E_ph cos(theta) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nTotal energy after collision is 2 E_ph. The initial energy is E_e + E_p = 4 m_e + 2 m_e = 6 m_e.\n\nSo 2 E_ph = 6 m_e \u2192 E_ph = 3 m_e.\n\nSubstituting back into the momentum equation:\n\n2 * 3 m_e * cos(theta) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m_e cos(theta) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m_e:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n\nNow, compute the value of this.\n\nCalculate sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298, sqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos(theta) \u2248 0.35682.\n\nNow, find theta in degrees: theta \u2248 arccos(0.35682).\n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.35682) is approximately 69 degrees.\n\nWait, wait, cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.3420. So 0.3568 is between 69 and 70 degrees. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nLet me calculate for 69 degrees:\n\ncos(69) \u2248 0.3584.\n\nOur value is 0.3568, which is a bit lower. So theta is slightly larger than 69 degrees. Let's say approximately 69.2 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me use a calculator to find it more precisely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using a calculator:\n\nUsing calculator, cos(69 degrees) is approximately 0.3584.\n\nOur value is 0.3568, which is a bit lower. So the angle is a bit larger than 69 degrees.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nAt 69.2 degrees: cos(69.2) \u2248 ?\n\nWell, each degree is about 0.01745 radians.\n\n69 degrees is 1.204 radians.\n\n0.2 degrees is 0.00349 radians.\n\nSo 69.2 degrees is 1.204 + 0.00349 \u2248 1.2075 radians.\n\ncos(1.2075) \u2248 cos(69.2\u00b0) \u2248 0.3568.\n\nYes, that's about right.\n\nSo theta \u2248 69.2 degrees.\n\nSo each photon is at about 69.2 degrees above and below the x-axis. The angle between them is 2 theta, which is about 138.4 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is 138. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 74\n\nB) 172\n\nC) 138\n\nD) 96.\n\nSo the angle between the photons is 2 theta \u2248 138 degrees, which matches option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, followed by the annihilation into two photons. The key is to apply conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Energy and Momentum\n- The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma_e = 4 \\), so its energy is \\( E_e = 4 m_e c^2 \\) and momentum is \\( p_e = \\sqrt{(4 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} / c = m_e \\sqrt{15} / c \\).\n- The positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma_p = 2 \\), so its energy is \\( E_p = 2 m_e c^2 \\) and momentum is \\( p_p = \\sqrt{(2 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} / c = m_e \\sqrt{3} / c \\), but since it moves left, \\( p_p = -m_e \\sqrt{3} / c \\).\n\nThe total initial momentum is:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{initial}} = p_e + p_p = \\frac{m_e}{c} (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n\\]\n\nThe total initial energy is:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{initial}} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Final Energy and Momentum\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies \\( E_{\\text{ph}} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nSo, the setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are one upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of the photons.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I think this involves conservation of energy and momentum because when particles annihilate, the resulting photons must carry away energy and momentum in such a way that these are conserved.\n\nWait, Lorentz factors. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So the electron has gamma_e =4, and positron gamma_p=2.\n\nBut wait, the positron is moving from the right. So, let's set up a coordinate system. Let me imagine the horizontal axis as the x-axis. So the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right), so their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, then the positron is moving towards the left, along the same axis. So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nSo in terms of momentum, the electron's momentum is in the positive x direction, and the positron's is in the negative x direction.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the momenta. The momentum of each particle is gamma * m * v. But for the positron, which is a particle of same mass as electron, but moving in the opposite direction.\n\nWait, but the positron has charge opposite to the electron, but same mass. So, both have same rest mass, m.\n\nSo, let me calculate their relativistic momenta.\n\nFor the electron: gamma_e =4, so p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But wait, v_e can be expressed in terms of gamma_e.\n\nAlternatively, since gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)), I can find beta (v/c) for each.\n\nLet me compute beta for electron and positron.\n\nFor the electron, gamma_e =4.\n\ngamma_e = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_e\u00b2) =4.\n\nSo 1 - beta_e\u00b2 = 1/(gamma_e^2) = 1/16.\n\nSo beta_e\u00b2 = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16. So beta_e = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682 c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2.\n\ngamma_p=1/sqrt(1 - beta_p^2)=2.\n\nSo 1 - beta_p^2=1/4.\n\nbeta_p^2=3/4, so beta_p=sqrt(3)/2\u22480.866 c.\n\nBut wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its velocity is negative. So in terms of momentum, the positron's momentum is in the negative x direction.\n\nSo, let's calculate their relativistic momenta.\n\nElectron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e c.\n\nSimilarly, positron's momentum: p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p (-c) [because moving left].\n\nWait, but wait, the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction. So p_p would be negative.\n\nSo, let me compute the magnitudes first.\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e c =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e * sqrt(15) c.\n\nSimilarly, p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p c =2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) c = m_e * sqrt(3) c.\n\nBut since the positron is moving left, its momentum is negative: p_p = - m_e * sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo that's the total momentum in the x-direction.\n\nNow, after the collision, we have two photons. Each photon has energy E. Since the photons have the same energy, their energies are equal.\n\nPhotons have energy E = pc, because for photons, E = |p| c, since their rest mass is zero.\n\nWait, but each photon's momentum is E/c in magnitude. So the total momentum after must equal the initial momentum.\n\nSo the initial momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction.\n\nAfter the collision, the two photons' momenta must add up to this.\n\nBut wait, the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So their directions are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively, but both in the right half-plane.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it says one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So both have positive x-components of momentum, because they are moving to the right.\n\nWait, but wait, if the initial momentum is in the positive x-direction, the total after must be positive. So the two photons' momenta must add up to a positive x-component.\n\nWait, but if both photons are moving to the right, their x-components are positive. So that makes sense.\n\nSo each photon has energy E, and their momenta are vectors in the plane.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.\n\nPhoton 1: direction upper-right, so its momentum vector has positive x and positive y components.\n\nPhoton 2: direction lower-right, positive x, negative y components.\n\nSo let me denote their momenta as vectors.\n\nPhotons' momenta are E/c times their direction vectors.\n\nLet me denote the angles of the photons with respect to the x-axis.\n\nPhoton 1: angle theta above the x-axis.\n\nPhoton 2: angle phi below the x-axis.\n\nSince both are moving to the right, theta and phi are positive angles in their respective quadrants.\n\nBecause both photons have the same energy E, their momenta have magnitudes E/c.\n\nSo, the momentum vectors are:\n\nPhoton 1: ( (E/c) cos(theta), (E/c) sin(theta) )\n\nPhoton 2: ( (E/c) cos(phi), -(E/c) sin(phi) )\n\nBecause the second photon is moving downward, so the y-component is negative.\n\nNow, the total momentum after is the sum of these two vectors.\n\nSo sum_x = (E/c) [ cos(theta) + cos(phi) ] \n\nsum_y = (E/c) [ sin(theta) - sin(phi) ]\n\nThe total momentum before was m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction, and zero in the y-direction.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\nsum_x = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) \n\nsum_y = 0 \n\nSo,\n\n(E/c) [ cos(theta) + cos(phi) ] = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) \n\n(E/c) [ sin(theta) - sin(phi) ] = 0 \n\nLet me simplify the second equation:\n\nsin(theta) - sin(phi) = 0 \n\nSo sin(theta) = sin(phi)\n\nWhich implies that theta = phi or theta = pi - phi. But considering their directions, theta is in the first quadrant (upper right), phi is in the fourth (lower right). So sin(theta) = sin(phi) would require that phi = -theta, because sin(theta) = sin(pi - theta). Wait, but if theta is in first quadrant, phi in fourth quadrant, then sin(phi) = -sin(theta). So sin(theta) - sin(phi) = sin(theta) + sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta) = 0.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the sum in the y-direction is (E/c) [ sin(theta) - sin(phi) ] =0.\n\nSo, sin(theta) = sin(phi).\n\nBut theta is in first quadrant, phi is in fourth. So sin(phi) is negative. So sin(theta) = sin(phi) implies that sin(theta) = - sin(phi'), where phi' is the positive angle for phi (since phi is measured below the x-axis, say as phi' = -phi, so sin(phi) = -sin(phi')).\n\nWait, maybe I should model phi as a negative angle. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to denote phi as the angle below the x-axis, so sin(phi) would be negative.\n\nWait, but the equation is sin(theta) = sin(phi), and if phi is the angle below the x-axis, then sin(phi) is negative. So for sin(theta) = sin(phi), and theta positive, phi negative (or in fourth quadrant), we have sin(theta) = -sin(phi'), where phi' is the magnitude of the angle in the fourth quadrant. So sin(theta) = - sin(phi') implies that sin(theta) = - sin(phi').\n\nWait, but in the equation, sin(theta) = sin(phi). So if phi is negative, sin(phi) = - sin(phi'), so sin(theta) = - sin(phi').\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of phi as the angle measured clockwise from the x-axis. So sin(phi) = - sin(phi'), where phi' is the angle in the fourth quadrant.\n\nWait, but the equation is sin(theta) = sin(phi). So if theta is positive (say 30 degrees), and phi is negative (say -30 degrees), then sin(theta)=sin(30)=0.5, sin(phi)=sin(-30)=-0.5. So 0.5 = -0.5? No, that's not possible. So perhaps the only solution is that both sines are zero, which would imply that theta and phi are zero, but that can't be because the photons are moving in different directions.\n\nWait, but another possibility is that theta + phi = pi, but that doesn't seem to fit either. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the setup.\n\nWait, the initial momentum in the y-direction is zero, so sum_y must be zero.\n\nSo, [ sin(theta) - sin(phi) ] =0.\n\nWhich implies sin(theta) = sin(phi).\n\nBut phi is the angle below the x-axis, so let's say phi is negative. So sin(phi) = - sin(|phi|).\n\nSo equation becomes sin(theta) = - sin(|phi|).\n\nWhich implies that sin(theta) = - sin(phi') where phi' is the magnitude of phi. So, sin(theta) = - sin(phi').\n\nBut sin(theta) is positive because theta is in the first quadrant. So this would imply that - sin(phi') is positive, which is only possible if sin(phi') is negative. But phi' is a positive angle in the fourth quadrant, so sin(phi') is negative, which makes - sin(phi') positive.\n\nWait, that's getting a bit tangled, but perhaps the only way for sin(theta) = sin(phi) is if phi is equal to - theta, because sin(-theta) = - sin(theta), which would make sin(theta) = - sin(theta) only if sin(theta) is zero, which isn't the case here. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the angles themselves. Let me consider that the two photons are symmetric in some way. Since their energies are the same, and their directions are in opposite quadrants, perhaps the angle between them is 2\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle each makes with the x-axis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, meaning that if one is at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, the other is at \u03b8 below, but that would make their y-components opposite. Wait, but in that case, the sum of the y-components would be zero, which fits the condition.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. So, if theta is the angle above the x-axis, then the other photon would have the same magnitude of angle but below, so phi = - theta.\n\nWait, but wait, that's exactly what the problem says: one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So that makes sense. So perhaps the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, each making the same angle \u03b8 above and below the x-axis.\n\nIn that case, the sum of the y-components would be zero, as required.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the sum of the x-components would be (E/c)(cos(theta) + cos(theta)) = 2 (E/c) cos(theta).\n\nThis must equal the initial x-momentum, which is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo,\n\n2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\n=> E = [ m_e c^2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / (2 cos(theta) )\n\nBut wait, also, the energy of each photon is E = h f, but in terms of momentum, E = |p| c. So each photon's energy is E = (p_photon) c.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly helpful yet.\n\nWait, but wait, the total energy after the collision should equal the total energy before.\n\nThe total energy before is the sum of the rest energy plus the kinetic energy of each particle.\n\nWait, but wait, the rest energy of an electron is m_e c^2. Same for the positron. So the total rest energy is 2 m_e c^2. But each also has kinetic energy due to their motion.\n\nWait, but since they're moving at relativistic speeds, their total energy is gamma * m_e c^2.\n\nSo, the electron's energy is gamma_e m_e c^2 =4 m_e c^2.\n\nThe positron's energy is gamma_p m_e c^2 =2 m_e c^2.\n\nSo the total initial energy is 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 =6 m_e c^2.\n\nAfter the collision, the two photons have energies E each, so total energy is 2 E.\n\nSo, 2 E =6 m_e c^2 => E=3 m_e c^2.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So each photon has energy E=3 m_e c^2.\n\nBut earlier, from the x-momentum, I had:\n\nE= [ m_e c^2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / (2 cos(theta) )\n\nSo,\n\n3 m_e c^2 = [ m_e c^2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / (2 cos(theta) )\n\nCancel m_e c^2 from both sides:\n\n3 = [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / (2 cos(theta) )\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 cos(theta):\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ] /6\n\nHmm, let me compute the value of this.\n\nCompute sqrt(15): approximately 3.87298.\n\nCompute sqrt(3): approximately 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 -1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093/6 \u2248 0.3568.\n\nSo cos(theta) \u2248 0.3568.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.3568) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, because cos(60) is 0.5, and cos(70) is about 0.3420. So 0.3568 is between 60 and 70 degrees, closer to 70.\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator: arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees.\n\nSo theta is about 69 degrees above the x-axis, and the other photon is 69 degrees below, making the angle between them 69 +69=138 degrees.\n\nWait, no, because the angle between the two photons would be the sum of the angles each makes with the x-axis on opposite sides. So each is at theta degrees above and below, so the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nWait, but wait, if each is at theta above and theta below, the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nSo, in this case, theta is about 69 degrees, so 2 theta is about 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees. So the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.\n\nSo let me recheck the steps.\n\n1. Calculated the Lorentz factors and beta for electron and positron.\n\n   Electron: gamma_e=4, beta_e=sqrt(15)/4.\n\n   Positron: gamma_p=2, beta_p= sqrt(3)/2.\n\n2. Calculated their momenta.\n\n   p_e =4 m_e c^2 * (sqrt(15)/4 c) /c =4 m_e c * sqrt(15)/4 = m_e c sqrt(15).\n\n   Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, the relativistic momentum p is gamma m v. But v = beta c.\n\n   So p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e c =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\n   Similarly, p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p c =2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) c = m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\n   But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative: p_p = - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\n   So total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\n3. After collision, two photons with same energy E, each moving in directions symmetric about x-axis (theta above, theta below).\n\n   So their x-components are E/c cos(theta) each, and y-components are E/c sin(theta) and -E/c sin(theta) respectively.\n\n   So sum_x = 2 E cos(theta)/c.\n\n   Sum_y = 0.\n\n4. Total energy before collision is sum of energies of electron and positron:\n\n   E_e = gamma_e m_e c^2 =4 m_e c^2.\n\n   E_p = gamma_p m_e c^2 =2 m_e c^2.\n\n   So total E_initial =6 m_e c^2.\n\n   After collision, photons' total energy is 2 E.\n\n   So 2 E =6 m_e c^2 \u2192 E=3 m_e c^2.\n\n5. Momentum after collision: sum_x =2 E cos(theta)/c =2 *3 m_e c^2 * cos(theta)/c =6 m_e c cos(theta).\n\n   This must equal the initial x-momentum: m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\n   So,\n\n   6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\n   Divide both sides by m_e c:\n\n   6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\n   So,\n\n   cos(theta) = (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6.\n\n   Compute this: as before, \u2248 (3.87298 -1.73205)/6 \u22482.14093/6\u22480.3568.\n\n   So theta \u2248 arccos(0.3568) \u224869 degrees.\n\n   So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta \u2248138 degrees.\n\nWhich matches option C.\n\nSo the answer should be option C) 138.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nSo, the setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are one upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of the photons.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I think this involves conservation of energy and momentum because when particles annihilate, the resulting photons must carry away energy and momentum in such a way that these are conserved.\n\nWait, Lorentz factors. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So the electron has gamma_e =4, and positron gamma_p=2.\n\nBut wait, the positron is moving from the right. So, let's set up a coordinate system. Let me imagine the horizontal axis as the x-axis. So the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right), so their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, then the positron is moving towards the left, along the same axis. So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nSo in terms of momentum, the electron's momentum is in the positive x direction, and the positron's is in the negative x direction.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the momenta. The momentum of each particle is gamma * m * v. But for the positron, which is a particle of same mass as electron, but moving in the opposite direction.\n\nWait, but the positron has charge opposite to the electron, but same mass. So, both have same rest mass, m.\n\nSo, let me calculate their relativistic momenta.\n\nFor the electron: gamma_e =4, so p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But wait, v_e can be expressed in terms of gamma_e.\n\nAlternatively, since gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)), I can find beta (v/c) for each.\n\nLet me compute beta for electron and positron.\n\nFor the electron, gamma_e =4.\n\ngamma_e = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_e\u00b2) =4.\n\nSo 1 - beta_e\u00b2 = 1/(gamma_e^2) = 1/16.\n\nSo beta_e\u00b2 = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16. So beta_e = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682 c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2.\n\ngamma_p=1/sqrt(1 - beta_p^2)=2.\n\nSo 1 - beta_p^2=1/4.\n\nbeta_p^2=3/4, so beta_p=sqrt(3)/2\u22480.866 c.\n\nBut wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its velocity is negative. So in terms of momentum, the positron's momentum is in the negative x direction.\n\nSo, let's calculate their relativistic momenta.\n\nElectron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e c.\n\nSimilarly, positron's momentum: p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p (-c) [because moving left].\n\nWait, but wait, the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction. So p_p would be negative.\n\nSo, let me compute the magnitudes first.\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e c =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e * sqrt(15) c.\n\nSimilarly, p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p c =2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) c = m_e * sqrt(3) c.\n\nBut since the positron is moving left, its momentum is negative: p_p = - m_e * sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo that's the total momentum in the x-direction.\n\nNow, after the collision, we have two photons. Each photon has energy E. Since the photons have the same energy, their energies are equal.\n\nPhotons have energy E = pc, because for photons, E = |p| c, since their rest mass is zero.\n\nWait, but each photon's momentum is E/c in magnitude. So the total momentum after must equal the initial momentum.\n\nSo the initial momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction.\n\nAfter the collision, the two photons' momenta must add up to this.\n\nBut wait, the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So their directions are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively, but both in the right half-plane.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it says one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So both have positive x-components of momentum, because they are moving to the right.\n\nWait, but wait, if the initial momentum is in the positive x-direction, the total after must be positive. So the two photons' momenta must add up to a positive x-component.\n\nWait, but if both photons are moving to the right, their x-components are positive. So that makes sense.\n\nSo each photon has energy E, and their momenta are vectors in the plane.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.\n\nPhoton 1: direction upper-right, so its momentum vector has positive x and positive y components.\n\nPhoton 2: direction lower-right, positive x, negative y components.\n\nSo let me denote their momenta as vectors.\n\nPhotons' momenta are E/c times their direction vectors.\n\nLet me denote the angles of the photons with respect to the x-axis.\n\nPhoton 1: angle theta above the x-axis.\n\nPhoton 2: angle phi below the x-axis.\n\nSince both are moving to the right, theta and phi are positive angles in their respective quadrants.\n\nBecause both photons have the same energy E, their momenta have magnitudes E/c.\n\nSo, the momentum vectors are:\n\nPhoton 1: ( (E/c) cos(theta), (E/c) sin(theta) )\n\nPhoton 2: ( (E/c) cos(phi), -(E/c) sin(phi) )\n\nBecause the second photon is moving downward, so the y-component is negative.\n\nNow, the total momentum after is the sum of these two vectors.\n\nSo sum_x = (E/c) [ cos(theta) + cos(phi) ] \n\nsum_y = (E/c) [ sin(theta) - sin(phi) ]\n\nThe total momentum before was m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction, and zero in the y-direction.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\nsum_x = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) \n\nsum_y = 0 \n\nSo,\n\n(E/c) [ cos(theta) + cos(phi) ] = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) \n\n(E/c) [ sin(theta) - sin(phi) ] = 0 \n\nLet me simplify the second equation:\n\nsin(theta) - sin(phi) = 0 \n\nSo sin(theta) = sin(phi)\n\nWhich implies that theta = phi or theta = pi - phi. But considering their directions, theta is in the first quadrant (upper right), phi is in the fourth (lower right). So sin(theta) = sin(phi) would require that phi = -theta, because sin(theta) = sin(pi - theta). Wait, but if theta is in first quadrant, phi in fourth quadrant, then sin(phi) = -sin(theta). So sin(theta) - sin(phi) = sin(theta) + sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta) = 0.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the sum in the y-direction is (E/c) [ sin(theta) - sin(phi) ] =0.\n\nSo, sin(theta) = sin(phi).\n\nBut theta is in first quadrant, phi is in fourth. So sin(phi) is negative. So sin(theta) = sin(phi) implies that sin(theta) = - sin(phi'), where phi' is the positive angle for phi (since phi is measured below the x-axis, say as phi' = -phi, so sin(phi) = -sin(phi')).\n\nWait, maybe I should model phi as a negative angle. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to denote phi as the angle below the x-axis, so sin(phi) would be negative.\n\nWait, but the equation is sin(theta) = sin(phi), and if phi is the angle below the x-axis, then sin(phi) is negative. So for sin(theta) = sin(phi), and theta positive, phi negative (or in fourth quadrant), we have sin(theta) = -sin(phi'), where phi' is the magnitude of the angle in the fourth quadrant. So sin(theta) = - sin(phi') implies that sin(theta) = - sin(phi').\n\nWait, but in the equation, sin(theta) = sin(phi). So if phi is negative, sin(phi) = - sin(phi'), so sin(theta) = - sin(phi').\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of phi as the angle measured clockwise from the x-axis. So sin(phi) = - sin(phi'), where phi' is the angle in the fourth quadrant.\n\nWait, but the equation is sin(theta) = sin(phi). So if theta is positive (say 30 degrees), and phi is negative (say -30 degrees), then sin(theta)=sin(30)=0.5, sin(phi)=sin(-30)=-0.5. So 0.5 = -0.5? No, that's not possible. So perhaps the only solution is that both sines are zero, which would imply that theta and phi are zero, but that can't be because the photons are moving in different directions.\n\nWait, but another possibility is that theta + phi = pi, but that doesn't seem to fit either. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the setup.\n\nWait, the initial momentum in the y-direction is zero, so sum_y must be zero.\n\nSo, [ sin(theta) - sin(phi) ] =0.\n\nWhich implies sin(theta) = sin(phi).\n\nBut phi is the angle below the x-axis, so let's say phi is negative. So sin(phi) = - sin(|phi|).\n\nSo equation becomes sin(theta) = - sin(|phi|).\n\nWhich implies that sin(theta) = - sin(phi') where phi' is the magnitude of phi. So, sin(theta) = - sin(phi').\n\nBut sin(theta) is positive because theta is in the first quadrant. So this would imply that - sin(phi') is positive, which is only possible if sin(phi') is negative. But phi' is a positive angle in the fourth quadrant, so sin(phi') is negative, which makes - sin(phi') positive.\n\nWait, that's getting a bit tangled, but perhaps the only way for sin(theta) = sin(phi) is if phi is equal to - theta, because sin(-theta) = - sin(theta), which would make sin(theta) = - sin(theta) only if sin(theta) is zero, which isn't the case here. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the angles themselves. Let me consider that the two photons are symmetric in some way. Since their energies are the same, and their directions are in opposite quadrants, perhaps the angle between them is 2\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle each makes with the x-axis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, meaning that if one is at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, the other is at \u03b8 below, but that would make their y-components opposite. Wait, but in that case, the sum of the y-components would be zero, which fits the condition.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. So, if theta is the angle above the x-axis, then the other photon would have the same magnitude of angle but below, so phi = - theta.\n\nWait, but wait, that's exactly what the problem says: one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So that makes sense. So perhaps the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, each making the same angle \u03b8 above and below the x-axis.\n\nIn that case, the sum of the y-components would be zero, as required.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the sum of the x-components would be (E/c)(cos(theta) + cos(theta)) = 2 (E/c) cos(theta).\n\nThis must equal the initial x-momentum, which is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo,\n\n2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\n=> E = [ m_e c^2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / (2 cos(theta) )\n\nBut wait, also, the energy of each photon is E = h f, but in terms of momentum, E = |p| c. So each photon's energy is E = (p_photon) c.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly helpful yet.\n\nWait, but wait, the total energy after the collision should equal the total energy before.\n\nThe total energy before is the sum of the rest energy plus the kinetic energy of each particle.\n\nWait, but wait, the rest energy of an electron is m_e c^2. Same for the positron. So the total rest energy is 2 m_e c^2. But each also has kinetic energy due to their motion.\n\nWait, but since they're moving at relativistic speeds, their total energy is gamma * m_e c^2.\n\nSo, the electron's energy is gamma_e m_e c^2 =4 m_e c^2.\n\nThe positron's energy is gamma_p m_e c^2 =2 m_e c^2.\n\nSo the total initial energy is 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 =6 m_e c^2.\n\nAfter the collision, the two photons have energies E each, so total energy is 2 E.\n\nSo, 2 E =6 m_e c^2 => E=3 m_e c^2.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So each photon has energy E=3 m_e c^2.\n\nBut earlier, from the x-momentum, I had:\n\nE= [ m_e c^2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / (2 cos(theta) )\n\nSo,\n\n3 m_e c^2 = [ m_e c^2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / (2 cos(theta) )\n\nCancel m_e c^2 from both sides:\n\n3 = [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / (2 cos(theta) )\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 cos(theta):\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ] /6\n\nHmm, let me compute the value of this.\n\nCompute sqrt(15): approximately 3.87298.\n\nCompute sqrt(3): approximately 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 -1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093/6 \u2248 0.3568.\n\nSo cos(theta) \u2248 0.3568.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.3568) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, because cos(60) is 0.5, and cos(70) is about 0.3420. So 0.3568 is between 60 and 70 degrees, closer to 70.\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator: arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees.\n\nSo theta is about 69 degrees above the x-axis, and the other photon is 69 degrees below, making the angle between them 69 +69=138 degrees.\n\nWait, no, because the angle between the two photons would be the sum of the angles each makes with the x-axis on opposite sides. So each is at theta degrees above and below, so the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nWait, but wait, if each is at theta above and theta below, the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nSo, in this case, theta is about 69 degrees, so 2 theta is about 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees. So the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.\n\nSo let me recheck the steps.\n\n1. Calculated the Lorentz factors and beta for electron and positron.\n\n   Electron: gamma_e=4, beta_e=sqrt(15)/4.\n\n   Positron: gamma_p=2, beta_p= sqrt(3)/2.\n\n2. Calculated their momenta.\n\n   p_e =4 m_e c^2 * (sqrt(15)/4 c) /c =4 m_e c * sqrt(15)/4 = m_e c sqrt(15).\n\n   Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, the relativistic momentum p is gamma m v. But v = beta c.\n\n   So p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e c =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\n   Similarly, p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p c =2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) c = m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\n   But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative: p_p = - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\n   So total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\n3. After collision, two photons with same energy E, each moving in directions symmetric about x-axis (theta above, theta below).\n\n   So their x-components are E/c cos(theta) each, and y-components are E/c sin(theta) and -E/c sin(theta) respectively.\n\n   So sum_x = 2 E cos(theta)/c.\n\n   Sum_y = 0.\n\n4. Total energy before collision is sum of energies of electron and positron:\n\n   E_e = gamma_e m_e c^2 =4 m_e c^2.\n\n   E_p = gamma_p m_e c^2 =2 m_e c^2.\n\n   So total E_initial =6 m_e c^2.\n\n   After collision, photons' total energy is 2 E.\n\n   So 2 E =6 m_e c^2 \u2192 E=3 m_e c^2.\n\n5. Momentum after collision: sum_x =2 E cos(theta)/c =2 *3 m_e c^2 * cos(theta)/c =6 m_e c cos(theta).\n\n   This must equal the initial x-momentum: m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\n   So,\n\n   6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\n   Divide both sides by m_e c:\n\n   6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\n   So,\n\n   cos(theta) = (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6.\n\n   Compute this: as before, \u2248 (3.87298 -1.73205)/6 \u22482.14093/6\u22480.3568.\n\n   So theta \u2248 arccos(0.3568) \u224869 degrees.\n\n   So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta \u2248138 degrees.\n\nWhich matches option C.\n\nSo the answer should be option C) 138.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy. The photons move in symmetric directions above and below the x-axis, ensuring the total momentum in the y-direction remains zero. The total momentum in the x-direction must match the initial momentum of the system.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Momentum and Energy\n1. **Electron's momentum**:  \n   The electron has a Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma_e = 4 \\) and moves to the right. Its momentum is:  \n   \\[\n   p_e = \\gamma_e m_e c \\beta_e = 4 m_e c \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} = m_e c \\sqrt{15}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Positron's momentum**:  \n   The positron has a Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma_p = 2 \\) and moves to the left. Its momentum is:  \n   \\[\n   p_p = \\gamma_p m_e c \\beta_p = 2 m_e c \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = m_e c \\sqrt{3}.\n   \\]  \n   Since the positron moves left, its momentum is negative:  \n   \\[\n   p_p = -m_e c \\sqrt{3}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total momentum before collision**:  \n   The total momentum in the x-direction is:  \n   \\[\n   p_{\\text{total}} = p_e + p_p = m_e c \\sqrt{15} - m_e c \\sqrt{3} = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total energy before collision**:  \n   The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron:  \n   \\[\n   E_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Momentum and Energy After Collision\n1. **Photon properties**:  \n   Each photon has energy \\( E \\) and momentum \\( p = E/c \\). The photons move symmetrically above and below the x-axis, making angles \\( \\theta \\) and \\( -\\theta \\) with the x-axis, respectively.\n\n2. **Momentum components**:  \n   The x-components of the photons' momenta are:  \n   \\[\n   p_{x,1} = \\frac{E}{c} \\cos\\theta, \\quad p_{x,2} = \\frac{E}{c} \\cos\\theta.\n   \\]  \n   The y-components cancel due to symmetry:  \n   \\[\n   p_{y,1} = \\frac{E}{c} \\sin\\theta, \\quad p_{y,2} = -\\frac{E}{c} \\sin\\theta.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total momentum after collision**:  \n   The total x-momentum is:  \n   \\[\n   p_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{E}{c} \\cos\\theta + \\frac{E}{c} \\cos\\theta = \\frac{2E}{c} \\cos\\theta.\n   \\]  \n   This must equal the initial x-momentum:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{2E}{c} \\cos\\theta = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Energy conservation**:  \n   The total energy after the collision is the sum of the photons' energies:  \n   \\[\n   E_{\\text{total}} = E + E = 2E.\n   \\]  \n   This must equal the total energy before the collision:  \n   \\[\n   2E = 6 m_e c^2 \\implies E = 3 m_e c^2.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( \\theta \\)\nFrom the momentum equation:  \n\\[\n\\frac{2E}{c} \\cos\\theta = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}),\n\\]  \nsubstitute \\( E = 3 m_e c^2 \\):  \n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\cdot 3 m_e c^2}{c} \\cos\\theta = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}),\n\\]  \n\\[\n6 m_e c \\cos\\theta = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}),\n\\]  \n\\[\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}.\n\\]  \nApproximating:  \n\\[\n\\cos\\theta \\approx 0.3568 \\implies \\theta \\approx 69^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Angle Between Photons\nThe photons are symmetric about the x-axis, one at \\( +\\theta \\) and the other at \\( -\\theta \\). The angle between them is:  \n\\[\n\\Delta\\phi = 2\\theta \\approx 2 \\cdot 69^\\circ = 138^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nAn electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing two photons. The energies of both photons are measured and found to be the same. One photon is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.\n\nHmm. So, electrons and positrons annihilate into photons. I remember that when matter and antimatter particles collide, they can produce gamma-ray photons. In this case, two photons are produced. \n\nWait, but the setup here is a bit more specific. The electron is moving left to right (along the horizontal axis) with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving right to left with a Lorentz factor of 2. Wait, no, wait, correction: the positron is moving from the right, which would be towards the left. Because if it's moving along the horizontal axis from the right, that's the same as moving to the left. So both are moving towards each other.\n\nWait, no, wait: the electron is moving from the left, so from left to right. The positron is moving from the right, so right to left. So they are approaching each other. When they collide, they annihilate. So their combined energy and momentum must equal the energy and momentum of the two photons.\n\nI think the key here is to apply conservation of energy and momentum. But since this is a high-energy scenario (with Lorentz factors 4 and 2), we can't ignore relativistic effects.\n\nSo, first, let's figure out the energies and momenta of the electron and positron before the collision.\n\nThe Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. For the electron: gamma_e = 4. For the positron: gamma_p = 2.\n\nThe rest mass of an electron is m_e, about 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2. But since positron and electron have same mass, both have m_e.\n\nSo, the total energy of each particle is gamma * m_e c\u00b2.\n\nElectron's energy: E_e = gamma_e * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nPositron's energy: E_p = gamma_p * m_e c\u00b2 = 2 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait: the positron is moving in the opposite direction. So its momentum is in the opposite direction. So when considering momentum, we'll have to account for direction.\n\nThe momentum of a relativistic particle is p = gamma m v. But v can be expressed in terms of beta and c, where beta is v/c. Alternatively, since p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c. So p = gamma m beta c.\n\nAlternatively, another expression for momentum in terms of energy is E\u00b2 = (pc c)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2. So E\u00b2 = (p c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. So p = sqrt( E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) / c.\n\nWait, but in this case, perhaps it's easier to compute each's momentum.\n\nFor the electron: gamma_e is 4. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e\u00b2)) ) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682. So beta_e is about 0.9682.\n\nSo, the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c. Since direction is to the right, let's take positive direction as to the right. So p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m_e * sqrt(15) * c.\n\nWait, wait: sqrt(15)/4 is approximately 0.9682, so 4 times that is sqrt(15) \u2248 3.872. So p_e = m_e * (sqrt(15)) * c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron: gamma_p = 2. So beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/(2\u00b2)) ) = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660. So beta_p is about 0.866.\n\nThe positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So p_p = - gamma_p m_e beta_p c = -2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * c = - m_e * sqrt(3) * c.\n\nSo total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) \u2248 m_e c (3.872 - 1.732 ) \u2248 m_e c (2.140).\n\nWait, but let me compute it accurately. sqrt(15) is about 3.87298, sqrt(3) is about 1.73205. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) is approximately 2.14093. So p_total \u2248 2.14093 m_e c.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so when adding, it's p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative).\n\nSo p_total = p_e + p_p = [4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4) c ] + [ 2 m_e (sqrt(3)/2) (-c) ].\n\nWait, let me compute each term correctly.\n\nElectron's momentum p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c.\n\ngamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4.\n\np_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m_e * sqrt(15) * c.\n\nSimilarly, positron's gamma_p is 2, beta_p is sqrt(3)/2. But since it's moving left, the momentum is negative. So p_p = -2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * c = - m_e * sqrt(3) * c.\n\nSo total momentum p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, the total energy before collision is E_total = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter the collision, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon. According to the problem, both photons have the same energy, so E_photon = E1 = E2 = same value.\n\nBut the total energy after collision must equal the total energy before. So 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo each photon has energy 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, wait. Because the rest mass energy of the electron is m_e c\u00b2 \u2248 0.511 MeV, so 3 m_e c\u00b2 would be about 1.533 MeV. But wait, that's the energy of each photon.\n\nNow, the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. So their momenta vectors are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively. Because upper-right is +x and +y, lower-right is +x and -y.\n\nEach photon's momentum magnitude is E_photon / c, since for photons, E = pc c \u2192 p = E/(c^2) * c \u2192 p = E/(c). Wait, wait, let me think: E_photon = p_photon c. So p_photon = E_photon / c.\n\nSo each photon has momentum magnitude p = (3 m_e c\u00b2) / c = 3 m_e c.\n\nWait, wait: E = p c \u2192 p = E/(c). So yes, each photon's momentum is 3 m_e c. But in different directions.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.\n\nPhoton 1: direction upper-right \u2192 has components (p_x, p_y) where p_x is positive, p_y is positive.\n\nPhoton 2: direction lower-right \u2192 has components (p_x', p_y') where p_x' is positive, p_y' is negative.\n\nWait, but the problem states that one is moving in upper-right and the other in lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but one upwards and the other downwards.\n\nWait, but that can't be the case. Because if both are moving to the right, their x-components would add up, but their y-components would be opposite. Hmm, but in any case, the total momentum after must equal the total before.\n\nSo, the total momentum after is the sum of the two photons' momenta.\n\nSo, summing their x-components and y-components.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nPhoton 1: momentum components (p1x, p1y)\n\nPhoton 2: momentum components (p2x, p2y)\n\nSince both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are same: p1 = p2 = 3 m_e c.\n\nBut their directions are different. Let me consider their angles with respect to the x-axis.\n\nSuppose photon 1 makes an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle \u03c6 below the x-axis.\n\nBut wait, since both are moving to the right, their x-components are positive. So p1x = p1 * cos\u03b8, p2x = p2 * cos\u03c6.\n\nSimilarly, p1y = p1 * sin\u03b8, p2y = p2 * sin\u03c6 (but since it's below, perhaps sin\u03c6 is negative, so p2y = -p2 sin\u03c6 if \u03c6 is measured as the angle below the x-axis.)\n\nWait, but in any case, the sum of the y-components must be zero, because the initial total momentum is all along the x-axis. Because the initial particles had only x-components of momentum.\n\nWait, no. Wait: the initial momentum is all along the x-axis, right? Because both the electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis. So the initial momentum is purely in the x-direction. So the total momentum after collision must also be purely in the x-direction. Because momentum is conserved. So the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero.\n\nSo sum_y = p1y + p2y = 0.\n\nWhich implies that p1y = - p2y.\n\nBut since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are the same. So, for photon 1, p1y = p1 sin\u03b8, photon 2, p2y = p2 sin\u03c6.\n\nBut since p1 = p2, and p1y = - p2y \u2192 p1 sin\u03b8 = - p2 sin\u03c6 \u2192 sin\u03b8 = - sin\u03c6.\n\nWhich implies that \u03b8 = - \u03c6, or \u03b8 = \u03c0 + \u03c6, but given that both are in the right direction, probably \u03b8 = - \u03c6.\n\nBut let's think in terms of the angles. Suppose photon 1 is at an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 is at angle \u03b8 below the x-axis. Wait, no, because if they are symmetric, their angles would be symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nWait, but in that case, their y-components would be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, summing to zero.\n\nWait, but the problem states that one photon is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right. So they are both in the right direction, but one upwards and the other downwards.\n\nSo, let's say photon 1 is at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 is at angle \u03c6 below the x-axis.\n\nBut for their y-components to cancel, we must have p1 sin\u03b8 = - p2 sin\u03c6.\n\nBut since p1 = p2 = 3 m_e c, this implies that sin\u03b8 = - sin\u03c6.\n\nWhich implies that \u03b8 = -\u03c6, or \u03b8 = \u03c0 - (-\u03c6), but given the movement direction, \u03b8 and \u03c6 would be in the first and fourth quadrants respectively.\n\nSo, for example, if photon 1 is at angle \u03b8, photon 2 is at angle -\u03b8.\n\nWait, but that would make their y-components opposite, and their x-components add.\n\nBut then the sum of the x-components would be p1 cos\u03b8 + p2 cos(-\u03b8) = p1 cos\u03b8 + p2 cos\u03b8 = (p1 + p2) cos\u03b8.\n\nBut the initial total momentum is p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) \u2248 2.14093 m_e c.\n\nSo the sum of the x-components after must equal p_initial.\n\nSo, sum_x = (p1 + p2) cos\u03b8 = 2 * (3 m_e c) * cos\u03b8 = 6 m_e c cos\u03b8.\n\nAnd this must equal the initial momentum, which is approximately 2.14093 m_e c.\n\nWait, wait, let's compute the exact value.\n\nWait, p_initial is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nSo, 6 m_e c cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nWe can divide both sides by m_e c: 6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298.\n\nsqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.356822.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.356822.\n\nWhat's the angle whose cosine is approximately 0.3568?\n\nHmm. Let me think. Cos(69 degrees) is about 0.3584, which is close. Because cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.3420. Wait, 69 degrees: cos(69) \u2248 0.3584. So 0.3568 is close to that, perhaps around 69 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute \u03b8 = arccos( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 ) \u2248 arccos(0.3568) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, but I can compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it exactly.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me think: perhaps the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8, because if one is at \u03b8 above and the other at \u03b8 below, the angle between them would be 2\u03b8.\n\nWait, no, because if one is at \u03b8 above and the other at \u03b8 below, then the angle between them would be \u03b8 + \u03b8 = 2\u03b8.\n\nWait, but wait: if one is at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and the other is at angle \u03b8 below, then the angle between their directions is 2\u03b8.\n\nSo, if \u03b8 is approximately 69 degrees, then 2\u03b8 would be about 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees. So that's a possible answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n- Both photons have energy E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\n- Each photon's momentum is p_photon = E_photon / c = 3 m_e c.\n\n- The sum of the y-components must be zero, so the photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So, if photon 1 has an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, photon 2 has \u03b8 below, but that would make their y-components opposite and their x-components add.\n\nWait, but wait, if both photons are moving to the right, their x-components are positive, but if one is above and the other is below, their y-components would be opposite. So sum_y = 0.\n\nSo sum_x = p1x + p2x = p_photon (cos\u03b8 + cos\u03b8) = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, no: because if one photon is at \u03b8 above x, and the other is at \u03c6 below x, then their x-components are p_photon cos\u03b8 and p_photon cos\u03c6. But since the photons are symmetric (their y-components must cancel), cos\u03b8 = cos\u03c6 because \u03b8 and \u03c6 are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let me denote photon 1's angle as \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2's angle as -\u03b8 (i.e., \u03b8 below the x-axis).\n\nSo, cos(-\u03b8) = cos\u03b8, and sin(-\u03b8) = -sin\u03b8.\n\nThus, the sum of the x-components is p_photon cos\u03b8 + p_photon cos\u03b8 = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8.\n\nThe sum of the y-components is p_photon sin\u03b8 + p_photon (-sin\u03b8) = 0.\n\nWhich matches the initial condition, since the initial total momentum is along x.\n\nSo, the sum_x is 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = p_initial.\n\nSo, 2 * (3 m_e c) * cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m_e c cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\ncos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n\nCompute this value:\n\nsqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298,\n\nsqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205,\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo \u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.35682) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nSo each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis. The angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees.\n\nSo the answer should be option C) 138.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nAn electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing two photons. The energies of both photons are measured and found to be the same. One photon is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.\n\nHmm. So, electrons and positrons annihilate into photons. I remember that when matter and antimatter particles collide, they can produce gamma-ray photons. In this case, two photons are produced. \n\nWait, but the setup here is a bit more specific. The electron is moving left to right (along the horizontal axis) with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving right to left with a Lorentz factor of 2. Wait, no, wait, correction: the positron is moving from the right, which would be towards the left. Because if it's moving along the horizontal axis from the right, that's the same as moving to the left. So both are moving towards each other.\n\nWait, no, wait: the electron is moving from the left, so from left to right. The positron is moving from the right, so right to left. So they are approaching each other. When they collide, they annihilate. So their combined energy and momentum must equal the energy and momentum of the two photons.\n\nI think the key here is to apply conservation of energy and momentum. But since this is a high-energy scenario (with Lorentz factors 4 and 2), we can't ignore relativistic effects.\n\nSo, first, let's figure out the energies and momenta of the electron and positron before the collision.\n\nThe Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. For the electron: gamma_e = 4. For the positron: gamma_p = 2.\n\nThe rest mass of an electron is m_e, about 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2. But since positron and electron have same mass, both have m_e.\n\nSo, the total energy of each particle is gamma * m_e c\u00b2.\n\nElectron's energy: E_e = gamma_e * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nPositron's energy: E_p = gamma_p * m_e c\u00b2 = 2 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait: the positron is moving in the opposite direction. So its momentum is in the opposite direction. So when considering momentum, we'll have to account for direction.\n\nThe momentum of a relativistic particle is p = gamma m v. But v can be expressed in terms of beta and c, where beta is v/c. Alternatively, since p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c. So p = gamma m beta c.\n\nAlternatively, another expression for momentum in terms of energy is E\u00b2 = (pc c)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2. So E\u00b2 = (p c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. So p = sqrt( E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) / c.\n\nWait, but in this case, perhaps it's easier to compute each's momentum.\n\nFor the electron: gamma_e is 4. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e\u00b2)) ) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682. So beta_e is about 0.9682.\n\nSo, the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c. Since direction is to the right, let's take positive direction as to the right. So p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m_e * sqrt(15) * c.\n\nWait, wait: sqrt(15)/4 is approximately 0.9682, so 4 times that is sqrt(15) \u2248 3.872. So p_e = m_e * (sqrt(15)) * c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron: gamma_p = 2. So beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/(2\u00b2)) ) = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660. So beta_p is about 0.866.\n\nThe positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So p_p = - gamma_p m_e beta_p c = -2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * c = - m_e * sqrt(3) * c.\n\nSo total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) \u2248 m_e c (3.872 - 1.732 ) \u2248 m_e c (2.140).\n\nWait, but let me compute it accurately. sqrt(15) is about 3.87298, sqrt(3) is about 1.73205. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) is approximately 2.14093. So p_total \u2248 2.14093 m_e c.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so when adding, it's p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative).\n\nSo p_total = p_e + p_p = [4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4) c ] + [ 2 m_e (sqrt(3)/2) (-c) ].\n\nWait, let me compute each term correctly.\n\nElectron's momentum p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c.\n\ngamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4.\n\np_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m_e * sqrt(15) * c.\n\nSimilarly, positron's gamma_p is 2, beta_p is sqrt(3)/2. But since it's moving left, the momentum is negative. So p_p = -2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * c = - m_e * sqrt(3) * c.\n\nSo total momentum p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, the total energy before collision is E_total = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter the collision, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon. According to the problem, both photons have the same energy, so E_photon = E1 = E2 = same value.\n\nBut the total energy after collision must equal the total energy before. So 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo each photon has energy 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, wait. Because the rest mass energy of the electron is m_e c\u00b2 \u2248 0.511 MeV, so 3 m_e c\u00b2 would be about 1.533 MeV. But wait, that's the energy of each photon.\n\nNow, the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. So their momenta vectors are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively. Because upper-right is +x and +y, lower-right is +x and -y.\n\nEach photon's momentum magnitude is E_photon / c, since for photons, E = pc c \u2192 p = E/(c^2) * c \u2192 p = E/(c). Wait, wait, let me think: E_photon = p_photon c. So p_photon = E_photon / c.\n\nSo each photon has momentum magnitude p = (3 m_e c\u00b2) / c = 3 m_e c.\n\nWait, wait: E = p c \u2192 p = E/(c). So yes, each photon's momentum is 3 m_e c. But in different directions.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.\n\nPhoton 1: direction upper-right \u2192 has components (p_x, p_y) where p_x is positive, p_y is positive.\n\nPhoton 2: direction lower-right \u2192 has components (p_x', p_y') where p_x' is positive, p_y' is negative.\n\nWait, but the problem states that one is moving in upper-right and the other in lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but one upwards and the other downwards.\n\nWait, but that can't be the case. Because if both are moving to the right, their x-components would add up, but their y-components would be opposite. Hmm, but in any case, the total momentum after must equal the total before.\n\nSo, the total momentum after is the sum of the two photons' momenta.\n\nSo, summing their x-components and y-components.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nPhoton 1: momentum components (p1x, p1y)\n\nPhoton 2: momentum components (p2x, p2y)\n\nSince both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are same: p1 = p2 = 3 m_e c.\n\nBut their directions are different. Let me consider their angles with respect to the x-axis.\n\nSuppose photon 1 makes an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle \u03c6 below the x-axis.\n\nBut wait, since both are moving to the right, their x-components are positive. So p1x = p1 * cos\u03b8, p2x = p2 * cos\u03c6.\n\nSimilarly, p1y = p1 * sin\u03b8, p2y = p2 * sin\u03c6 (but since it's below, perhaps sin\u03c6 is negative, so p2y = -p2 sin\u03c6 if \u03c6 is measured as the angle below the x-axis.)\n\nWait, but in any case, the sum of the y-components must be zero, because the initial total momentum is all along the x-axis. Because the initial particles had only x-components of momentum.\n\nWait, no. Wait: the initial momentum is all along the x-axis, right? Because both the electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis. So the initial momentum is purely in the x-direction. So the total momentum after collision must also be purely in the x-direction. Because momentum is conserved. So the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero.\n\nSo sum_y = p1y + p2y = 0.\n\nWhich implies that p1y = - p2y.\n\nBut since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are the same. So, for photon 1, p1y = p1 sin\u03b8, photon 2, p2y = p2 sin\u03c6.\n\nBut since p1 = p2, and p1y = - p2y \u2192 p1 sin\u03b8 = - p2 sin\u03c6 \u2192 sin\u03b8 = - sin\u03c6.\n\nWhich implies that \u03b8 = - \u03c6, or \u03b8 = \u03c0 + \u03c6, but given that both are in the right direction, probably \u03b8 = - \u03c6.\n\nBut let's think in terms of the angles. Suppose photon 1 is at an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 is at angle \u03b8 below the x-axis. Wait, no, because if they are symmetric, their angles would be symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nWait, but in that case, their y-components would be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, summing to zero.\n\nWait, but the problem states that one photon is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right. So they are both in the right direction, but one upwards and the other downwards.\n\nSo, let's say photon 1 is at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 is at angle \u03c6 below the x-axis.\n\nBut for their y-components to cancel, we must have p1 sin\u03b8 = - p2 sin\u03c6.\n\nBut since p1 = p2 = 3 m_e c, this implies that sin\u03b8 = - sin\u03c6.\n\nWhich implies that \u03b8 = -\u03c6, or \u03b8 = \u03c0 - (-\u03c6), but given the movement direction, \u03b8 and \u03c6 would be in the first and fourth quadrants respectively.\n\nSo, for example, if photon 1 is at angle \u03b8, photon 2 is at angle -\u03b8.\n\nWait, but that would make their y-components opposite, and their x-components add.\n\nBut then the sum of the x-components would be p1 cos\u03b8 + p2 cos(-\u03b8) = p1 cos\u03b8 + p2 cos\u03b8 = (p1 + p2) cos\u03b8.\n\nBut the initial total momentum is p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) \u2248 2.14093 m_e c.\n\nSo the sum of the x-components after must equal p_initial.\n\nSo, sum_x = (p1 + p2) cos\u03b8 = 2 * (3 m_e c) * cos\u03b8 = 6 m_e c cos\u03b8.\n\nAnd this must equal the initial momentum, which is approximately 2.14093 m_e c.\n\nWait, wait, let's compute the exact value.\n\nWait, p_initial is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nSo, 6 m_e c cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nWe can divide both sides by m_e c: 6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298.\n\nsqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.356822.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.356822.\n\nWhat's the angle whose cosine is approximately 0.3568?\n\nHmm. Let me think. Cos(69 degrees) is about 0.3584, which is close. Because cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.3420. Wait, 69 degrees: cos(69) \u2248 0.3584. So 0.3568 is close to that, perhaps around 69 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute \u03b8 = arccos( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 ) \u2248 arccos(0.3568) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, but I can compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it exactly.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me think: perhaps the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8, because if one is at \u03b8 above and the other at \u03b8 below, the angle between them would be 2\u03b8.\n\nWait, no, because if one is at \u03b8 above and the other at \u03b8 below, then the angle between them would be \u03b8 + \u03b8 = 2\u03b8.\n\nWait, but wait: if one is at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and the other is at angle \u03b8 below, then the angle between their directions is 2\u03b8.\n\nSo, if \u03b8 is approximately 69 degrees, then 2\u03b8 would be about 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees. So that's a possible answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n- Both photons have energy E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\n- Each photon's momentum is p_photon = E_photon / c = 3 m_e c.\n\n- The sum of the y-components must be zero, so the photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So, if photon 1 has an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, photon 2 has \u03b8 below, but that would make their y-components opposite and their x-components add.\n\nWait, but wait, if both photons are moving to the right, their x-components are positive, but if one is above and the other is below, their y-components would be opposite. So sum_y = 0.\n\nSo sum_x = p1x + p2x = p_photon (cos\u03b8 + cos\u03b8) = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, no: because if one photon is at \u03b8 above x, and the other is at \u03c6 below x, then their x-components are p_photon cos\u03b8 and p_photon cos\u03c6. But since the photons are symmetric (their y-components must cancel), cos\u03b8 = cos\u03c6 because \u03b8 and \u03c6 are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let me denote photon 1's angle as \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2's angle as -\u03b8 (i.e., \u03b8 below the x-axis).\n\nSo, cos(-\u03b8) = cos\u03b8, and sin(-\u03b8) = -sin\u03b8.\n\nThus, the sum of the x-components is p_photon cos\u03b8 + p_photon cos\u03b8 = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8.\n\nThe sum of the y-components is p_photon sin\u03b8 + p_photon (-sin\u03b8) = 0.\n\nWhich matches the initial condition, since the initial total momentum is along x.\n\nSo, the sum_x is 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = p_initial.\n\nSo, 2 * (3 m_e c) * cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m_e c cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\ncos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n\nCompute this value:\n\nsqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298,\n\nsqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205,\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo \u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.35682) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nSo each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis. The angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees.\n\nSo the answer should be option C) 138.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy. The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:\n   - The electron has a Lorentz factor of \\( \\gamma_e = 4 \\), and the positron has \\( \\gamma_p = 2 \\).\n   - The rest energy of the electron (or positron) is \\( m_e c^2 \\), where \\( m_e \\) is the electron mass.\n   - Total energy before collision:  \n     \\[\n     E_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.\n     \\]\n   - Total momentum before collision:  \n     \\[\n     p_{\\text{total}} = p_e + p_p,\n     \\]\n     where \\( p_e = \\gamma_e m_e \\beta_e c \\) and \\( p_p = -\\gamma_p m_e \\beta_p c \\) (negative because the positron moves in the opposite direction).  \n     Using \\( \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} \\):  \n     \\[\n     \\beta_e = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}, \\quad \\beta_p = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.\n     \\]\n     Substituting:  \n     \\[\n     p_e = 4 m_e \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c = m_e \\sqrt{15} c, \\quad p_p = -2 m_e \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c = -m_e \\sqrt{3} c.\n     \\]\n     Thus:  \n     \\[\n     p_{\\text{total}} = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n     \\]\n\n2. **Photon Properties After Annihilation**:\n   - The total energy after annihilation is shared equally between the two photons:  \n     \\[\n     E_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2.\n     \\]\n   - For photons, \\( E = pc \\), so the momentum of each photon is:  \n     \\[\n     p_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_e c.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Conservation of Momentum**:\n   - After annihilation, the two photons move in opposite directions above and below the x-axis. Let the angles of the photons with respect to the x-axis be \\( \\theta \\) and \\( -\\theta \\) (symmetric about the x-axis due to conservation of momentum).\n   - The x-components of the photons' momenta add up to match the initial total momentum:  \n     \\[\n     p_{\\text{total}} = 2 p_{\\text{photon}} \\cos\\theta.\n     \\]\n     Substituting \\( p_{\\text{total}} = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\) and \\( p_{\\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c \\):  \n     \\[\n     2 (3 m_e c) \\cos\\theta = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n     \\]\n     Simplify:  \n     \\[\n     6 \\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}.\n     \\]\n     Compute \\( \\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.872 \\) and \\( \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732 \\):  \n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} \\approx 2.141, \\quad \\cos\\theta = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568.\n     \\]\n     Thus:  \n     \\[\n     \\theta \\approx \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69^\\circ.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Angle Between the Photons**:\n   - Since one photon is at \\( +\\theta \\) and the other at \\( -\\theta \\), the angle between them is:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Angle} = \\theta - (-\\theta) = 2\\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69^\\circ = 138^\\circ.\n     \\]\n\nThus, the angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, let me try to think this through.\n\nSo the setup is an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.\n\nWait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma for the electron is 4, and for the positron it's 2. But wait, since the positron is moving to the right, and the electron is moving to the left? Or wait, no, the electron is moving from the left, so it's moving to the right as well? Or wait, the electron is moving from the left, so along the positive x-direction. The positron is moving from the right, so also along positive x? Or wait, maybe the positron is moving in the opposite direction. Hmm, I need to get that straight.\n\nWait, the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal (let's say x-axis), so direction is positive x. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right, so that would be negative x direction, right? Because if it's moving from the right, it's going left along the x-axis. So their velocities are opposite.\n\nWait, but Lorentz factor is always positive, it's a scalar. So their speeds are gamma times the speed of light, but in opposite directions.\n\nSo, the electron (mass m_e) has gamma_e =4, so its speed is v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2) = c*sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c*sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)c. Similarly, the positron has gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c*sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2)c. But wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative.\n\nSo the electron is moving to the right with speed v_e, and the positron to the left with speed v_p.\n\nWait, but when they collide, what's their frame of reference? Or perhaps I should think about conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nIn the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum should be zero. But wait, in the lab frame, the momentum is the sum of their momenta.\n\nWait, the problem says they annihilate into two photons with the same energy. So both photons have same energy but opposite directions? Wait no, because the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So they're both moving to the right but at different angles.\n\nWait, but wait, the two photons must have equal and opposite momenta if the system's total momentum is conserved. Because the initial system's momentum is from the electron and positron.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the initial momentum of the system and set that equal to the sum of the photon momenta.\n\nLet me get the initial momenta.\n\nThe electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But wait, in terms of units, sometimes people use relativistic momentum p = gamma m v.\n\nWait, but another approach is to calculate the relativistic momentum correctly. The relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v.\n\nBut wait, the electron and positron have the same mass, but opposite velocities.\n\nSo, let me compute the momenta.\n\nElectron (left to right): gamma_e=4, m_e, v_e = (sqrt(15)/4)c.\n\nPositron (right to left): gamma_p=2, m_e, v_p = -(sqrt(3)/2)c.\n\nSo their momenta are:\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e * sqrt(15) c.\n\np_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) = -m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo total initial momentum is p_total = p_e + p_p = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but in which direction? Because the electron is moving right, and the positron left. So their momenta are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in signs. Let me recheck:\n\nElectron is moving to the right, so p_e is positive. Positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative, so p_p is negative.\n\nWait, wait, wait. The positron's velocity is in the opposite direction, so v_p is negative. So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) )= - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo the total momentum is p_e + p_p = (4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4 c)) ) + (2 m_e (-sqrt(3)/2 c)).\n\nWait, no. Wait, gamma_e is 4, v_e is (sqrt(15)/4)c, so p_e is 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\nSimilarly, p_p is 2 * m_e * ( - sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nHmm, but wait, the electron's speed is v_e = (sqrt(15)/4)c \u2248 0.968c, and the positron's speed is (sqrt(3)/2)c \u22480.866c.\n\nSo the electron is moving to the right, the positron to the left. So their momenta are in opposite directions, but the electron's momentum is bigger because gamma is 4 vs 2.\n\nSo the total momentum is in the direction of the electron's motion (right) because sqrt(15) is about 3.87, and sqrt(3) is about 1.73, so 3.87 - 1.73 \u2248 2.14. So positive.\n\nSo the total momentum is p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, after annihilation, the two photons have the same energy, E1 = E2 = E.\n\nPhotons' energy is E = pc, since for photons, E = |p| c, and direction is determined by the momentum vector.\n\nSo each photon has momentum magnitude p = E/c.\n\nBut the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the initial total momentum.\n\nLet me denote the momenta of the photons as vectors.\n\nLet me denote the direction along the x-axis as the initial direction. Since the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, their angles are measured from the x-axis in the upper and lower right quadrants.\n\nLet me assume photon 1 has an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 has an angle phi below the x-axis. Since both are moving to the right, their x-components are positive.\n\nWait, but the problem states one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are to the right, but one is above the x-axis, the other below.\n\nSo their momenta vectors are:\n\np1 = (p_x1, p_y1) = (p cos theta, p sin theta)\n\np2 = (p_x2, p_y2) = (p cos phi, -p sin phi) [since it's lower-right, phi is positive in the fourth quadrant.]\n\nWait, but the sum of p1 and p2 must equal the initial momentum vector.\n\nSo the sum:\n\np_total_x = p cos theta + p cos phi\n\np_total_y = p sin theta - p sin phi\n\nBut the initial total momentum is all along the x-axis, so the y-component must be zero.\n\nSo:\n\np sin theta - p sin phi = 0 \u2192 sin theta = sin phi.\n\nBut since theta is above the x-axis and phi is below, so sin phi = - sin theta, but wait, in the equation, we have p sin theta - p sin phi =0 \u2192 sin theta = sin phi.\n\nWait, but if phi is in the fourth quadrant, sin phi is negative. So sin theta = sin phi \u2192 sin theta = - sin theta? No, that can't be right unless sin theta =0, which would imply theta=0, but that's not the case here.\n\nHmm, maybe I messed up the signs. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the second photon is moving in the lower-right direction, so its y-component is negative. So p2's y-component is - p sin phi, where phi is the angle below the x-axis.\n\nSo when I sum the y-components:\n\np sin theta (from p1) + (-p sin phi) (from p2) = 0.\n\nSo p sin theta - p sin phi =0 \u2192 sin theta = sin phi.\n\nBut phi is in the lower direction, so phi is positive, but sin phi is negative. So sin theta = - sin phi \u2192 but since theta is between 0 and 90, and phi is between 0 and 180 (but in lower right, so 0 to 180 in the fourth quadrant?), I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as:\n\np1 has angle theta above x-axis, p2 has angle -theta below x-axis, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe both angles are measured from the x-axis, but one is positive and the other negative.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to set the angles as theta and (360 - theta), but that's probably complicating it.\n\nWait, maybe the two photons have symmetric angles above and below the x-axis. So theta and -theta, but in terms of direction, that would make their y-components opposite, summing to zero.\n\nBut the problem states that one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their angles would be theta and (360 - theta), but that's not correct because 360 - theta would be in the fourth quadrant, same as -theta.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they are symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nWait, but in that case, sin theta = sin phi, but with phi = -theta.\n\nSo let's say phi = -theta.\n\nThen p_total_y would be p sin theta + p sin(-theta) = p sin theta - p sin theta =0, which satisfies the condition.\n\nSo that makes sense. So the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, making angles theta above and below the x-axis.\n\nSo each has the same energy, same |p|, and their angles are symmetric. So their momenta are (p cos theta, p sin theta) and (p cos theta, -p sin theta).\n\nWait, but then the sum of their momenta would be (2 p cos theta, 0), which must equal the initial total momentum vector, which is (p_total, 0).\n\nSo 2 p cos theta = p_total \u2192 cos theta = p_total/(2 p).\n\nBut p is the magnitude of the photon's momentum, which is E/c. So p = E/c.\n\nSo cos theta = (p_total c)/(2 E).\n\nBut what is p_total?\n\nEarlier, p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo substituting:\n\ncos theta = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * c ] / ( 2 E )\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me double-check.\n\np_total is in the x-direction: p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nEach photon's momentum is p = E/c.\n\nSo for each photon, p = E/c. So p_total is equal to 2 p cos theta.\n\nSo:\n\n2 (E/c) cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo,\n\ncos theta = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * c ] / (2 E )\n\nWait, but that seems a bit messy. Let me think about the energy.\n\nThe total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nEach particle's energy is gamma m c^2.\n\nSo E_e = gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2.\n\nE_p = gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2.\n\nTotal energy before annihilation: E_total = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 =6 m_e c^2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the photons carry away this energy. Each photon has energy E, so 2 E =6 m_e c^2 \u2192 E=3 m_e c^2.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Each photon has energy E =3 m_e c^2.\n\nSo E =3 m_e c^2.\n\nSo each photon's momentum is p = E/c =3 m_e c.\n\nSo going back to the momentum equation:\n\n2 p cos theta = p_total \u2192 2*(3 m_e c) * cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m_e c cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos theta = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos theta = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.\n\nHmm, let me compute that numerically.\n\nsqrt(15) \u22483.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) \u22482.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u22480.35682.\n\nSo cos theta \u22480.35682 \u2192 theta \u2248acos(0.35682) \u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, so each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis, making the angle between them 2*69=138 degrees.\n\nBecause the two photons are symmetric, each at theta and -theta from the x-axis. So the angle between them is theta - (-theta)= 2 theta.\n\nSo 2 *69 is 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138.\n\nSo the angle between the photons is 138 degrees.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, let me try to think this through.\n\nSo the setup is an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.\n\nWait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma for the electron is 4, and for the positron it's 2. But wait, since the positron is moving to the right, and the electron is moving to the left? Or wait, no, the electron is moving from the left, so it's moving to the right as well? Or wait, the electron is moving from the left, so along the positive x-direction. The positron is moving from the right, so also along positive x? Or wait, maybe the positron is moving in the opposite direction. Hmm, I need to get that straight.\n\nWait, the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal (let's say x-axis), so direction is positive x. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right, so that would be negative x direction, right? Because if it's moving from the right, it's going left along the x-axis. So their velocities are opposite.\n\nWait, but Lorentz factor is always positive, it's a scalar. So their speeds are gamma times the speed of light, but in opposite directions.\n\nSo, the electron (mass m_e) has gamma_e =4, so its speed is v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2) = c*sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c*sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)c. Similarly, the positron has gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c*sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2)c. But wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative.\n\nSo the electron is moving to the right with speed v_e, and the positron to the left with speed v_p.\n\nWait, but when they collide, what's their frame of reference? Or perhaps I should think about conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nIn the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum should be zero. But wait, in the lab frame, the momentum is the sum of their momenta.\n\nWait, the problem says they annihilate into two photons with the same energy. So both photons have same energy but opposite directions? Wait no, because the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So they're both moving to the right but at different angles.\n\nWait, but wait, the two photons must have equal and opposite momenta if the system's total momentum is conserved. Because the initial system's momentum is from the electron and positron.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the initial momentum of the system and set that equal to the sum of the photon momenta.\n\nLet me get the initial momenta.\n\nThe electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But wait, in terms of units, sometimes people use relativistic momentum p = gamma m v.\n\nWait, but another approach is to calculate the relativistic momentum correctly. The relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v.\n\nBut wait, the electron and positron have the same mass, but opposite velocities.\n\nSo, let me compute the momenta.\n\nElectron (left to right): gamma_e=4, m_e, v_e = (sqrt(15)/4)c.\n\nPositron (right to left): gamma_p=2, m_e, v_p = -(sqrt(3)/2)c.\n\nSo their momenta are:\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e * sqrt(15) c.\n\np_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) = -m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo total initial momentum is p_total = p_e + p_p = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but in which direction? Because the electron is moving right, and the positron left. So their momenta are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in signs. Let me recheck:\n\nElectron is moving to the right, so p_e is positive. Positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative, so p_p is negative.\n\nWait, wait, wait. The positron's velocity is in the opposite direction, so v_p is negative. So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) )= - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo the total momentum is p_e + p_p = (4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4 c)) ) + (2 m_e (-sqrt(3)/2 c)).\n\nWait, no. Wait, gamma_e is 4, v_e is (sqrt(15)/4)c, so p_e is 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\nSimilarly, p_p is 2 * m_e * ( - sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nHmm, but wait, the electron's speed is v_e = (sqrt(15)/4)c \u2248 0.968c, and the positron's speed is (sqrt(3)/2)c \u22480.866c.\n\nSo the electron is moving to the right, the positron to the left. So their momenta are in opposite directions, but the electron's momentum is bigger because gamma is 4 vs 2.\n\nSo the total momentum is in the direction of the electron's motion (right) because sqrt(15) is about 3.87, and sqrt(3) is about 1.73, so 3.87 - 1.73 \u2248 2.14. So positive.\n\nSo the total momentum is p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, after annihilation, the two photons have the same energy, E1 = E2 = E.\n\nPhotons' energy is E = pc, since for photons, E = |p| c, and direction is determined by the momentum vector.\n\nSo each photon has momentum magnitude p = E/c.\n\nBut the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the initial total momentum.\n\nLet me denote the momenta of the photons as vectors.\n\nLet me denote the direction along the x-axis as the initial direction. Since the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, their angles are measured from the x-axis in the upper and lower right quadrants.\n\nLet me assume photon 1 has an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 has an angle phi below the x-axis. Since both are moving to the right, their x-components are positive.\n\nWait, but the problem states one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are to the right, but one is above the x-axis, the other below.\n\nSo their momenta vectors are:\n\np1 = (p_x1, p_y1) = (p cos theta, p sin theta)\n\np2 = (p_x2, p_y2) = (p cos phi, -p sin phi) [since it's lower-right, phi is positive in the fourth quadrant.]\n\nWait, but the sum of p1 and p2 must equal the initial momentum vector.\n\nSo the sum:\n\np_total_x = p cos theta + p cos phi\n\np_total_y = p sin theta - p sin phi\n\nBut the initial total momentum is all along the x-axis, so the y-component must be zero.\n\nSo:\n\np sin theta - p sin phi = 0 \u2192 sin theta = sin phi.\n\nBut since theta is above the x-axis and phi is below, so sin phi = - sin theta, but wait, in the equation, we have p sin theta - p sin phi =0 \u2192 sin theta = sin phi.\n\nWait, but if phi is in the fourth quadrant, sin phi is negative. So sin theta = sin phi \u2192 sin theta = - sin theta? No, that can't be right unless sin theta =0, which would imply theta=0, but that's not the case here.\n\nHmm, maybe I messed up the signs. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the second photon is moving in the lower-right direction, so its y-component is negative. So p2's y-component is - p sin phi, where phi is the angle below the x-axis.\n\nSo when I sum the y-components:\n\np sin theta (from p1) + (-p sin phi) (from p2) = 0.\n\nSo p sin theta - p sin phi =0 \u2192 sin theta = sin phi.\n\nBut phi is in the lower direction, so phi is positive, but sin phi is negative. So sin theta = - sin phi \u2192 but since theta is between 0 and 90, and phi is between 0 and 180 (but in lower right, so 0 to 180 in the fourth quadrant?), I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as:\n\np1 has angle theta above x-axis, p2 has angle -theta below x-axis, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe both angles are measured from the x-axis, but one is positive and the other negative.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to set the angles as theta and (360 - theta), but that's probably complicating it.\n\nWait, maybe the two photons have symmetric angles above and below the x-axis. So theta and -theta, but in terms of direction, that would make their y-components opposite, summing to zero.\n\nBut the problem states that one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their angles would be theta and (360 - theta), but that's not correct because 360 - theta would be in the fourth quadrant, same as -theta.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they are symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nWait, but in that case, sin theta = sin phi, but with phi = -theta.\n\nSo let's say phi = -theta.\n\nThen p_total_y would be p sin theta + p sin(-theta) = p sin theta - p sin theta =0, which satisfies the condition.\n\nSo that makes sense. So the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, making angles theta above and below the x-axis.\n\nSo each has the same energy, same |p|, and their angles are symmetric. So their momenta are (p cos theta, p sin theta) and (p cos theta, -p sin theta).\n\nWait, but then the sum of their momenta would be (2 p cos theta, 0), which must equal the initial total momentum vector, which is (p_total, 0).\n\nSo 2 p cos theta = p_total \u2192 cos theta = p_total/(2 p).\n\nBut p is the magnitude of the photon's momentum, which is E/c. So p = E/c.\n\nSo cos theta = (p_total c)/(2 E).\n\nBut what is p_total?\n\nEarlier, p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo substituting:\n\ncos theta = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * c ] / ( 2 E )\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me double-check.\n\np_total is in the x-direction: p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nEach photon's momentum is p = E/c.\n\nSo for each photon, p = E/c. So p_total is equal to 2 p cos theta.\n\nSo:\n\n2 (E/c) cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo,\n\ncos theta = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * c ] / (2 E )\n\nWait, but that seems a bit messy. Let me think about the energy.\n\nThe total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nEach particle's energy is gamma m c^2.\n\nSo E_e = gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2.\n\nE_p = gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2.\n\nTotal energy before annihilation: E_total = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 =6 m_e c^2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the photons carry away this energy. Each photon has energy E, so 2 E =6 m_e c^2 \u2192 E=3 m_e c^2.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Each photon has energy E =3 m_e c^2.\n\nSo E =3 m_e c^2.\n\nSo each photon's momentum is p = E/c =3 m_e c.\n\nSo going back to the momentum equation:\n\n2 p cos theta = p_total \u2192 2*(3 m_e c) * cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m_e c cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos theta = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos theta = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.\n\nHmm, let me compute that numerically.\n\nsqrt(15) \u22483.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) \u22482.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u22480.35682.\n\nSo cos theta \u22480.35682 \u2192 theta \u2248acos(0.35682) \u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, so each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis, making the angle between them 2*69=138 degrees.\n\nBecause the two photons are symmetric, each at theta and -theta from the x-axis. So the angle between them is theta - (-theta)= 2 theta.\n\nSo 2 *69 is 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138.\n\nSo the angle between the photons is 138 degrees.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron annihilate into two photons of equal energy, moving in symmetric directions above and below the x-axis. The goal is to find the angle between the two photons.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Momentum of the System\nThe electron and positron have Lorentz factors $\\gamma_e = 4$ and $\\gamma_p = 2$, respectively. Their velocities are calculated as:\n\\[\nv_e = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_e^2}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}c, \\quad v_p = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_p^2}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}c.\n\\]\nThe electron moves to the right, while the positron moves to the left. Their relativistic momenta are:\n\\[\np_e = \\gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}c = m_e \\sqrt{15}c, \\quad p_p = \\gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}c = m_e \\sqrt{3}c.\n\\]\nThe total momentum of the system is:\n\\[\np_{\\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Energy of the Photons\nThe total energy of the system before annihilation is:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.\n\\]\nAfter annihilation, this energy is shared equally between the two photons:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Photon Momentum and Symmetry\nEach photon has energy $E_{\\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c^2$, and since $E = pc$ for photons, the momentum of each photon is:\n\\[\np_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_e c.\n\\]\nThe photons move symmetrically above and below the x-axis, making angles $\\theta$ and $-\\theta$ with the x-axis. The total momentum of the system must equal the vector sum of the photons' momenta:\n\\[\np_{\\text{total}} = 2 p_{\\text{photon}} \\cos\\theta.\n\\]\nSubstituting $p_{\\text{total}} = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})$ and $p_{\\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c$:\n\\[\n2 (3 m_e c) \\cos\\theta = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n6 \\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate $\\theta$\nNumerically:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.872, \\quad \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732, \\quad \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} \\approx 2.140.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{2.140}{6} \\approx 0.3567.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\theta = \\arccos(0.3567) \\approx 69^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Angle Between the Photons\nThe two photons are symmetrically placed at angles $\\theta$ and $-\\theta$ relative to the x-axis. The angle between them is:\n\\[\n\\Delta\\theta = \\theta - (-\\theta) = 2\\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69^\\circ = 138^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons colliding and producing photons. Hmm, I need to figure out the angle between the two photons. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nAlright, so an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy and their directions are measured as upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.\n\nWait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is the factor by which time dilation and length contraction occur. For the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, it's 2.\n\nBut wait, when they annihilate, they produce two photons. Since energy and momentum must be conserved, I should probably think about conservation laws here. Also, the photons have the same energy, so each has energy E.\n\nLet me think about the system's total energy and momentum before the collision. Then I can set that equal to the total after, which is the two photons.\n\nFirst, let's find the rest mass energy of the electron and positron. Oh wait, since they are each other's antiparticles, their rest masses are the same. The rest energy of an electron is mc\u00b2, which is about 0.511 MeV. But when we're dealing with high speeds, their energies will be higher due to the gamma factor.\n\nSo for the electron, its total energy is gamma * mc\u00b2. Similarly for the positron. Since gamma_e is 4 and gamma_p is 2, their energies are 4mc\u00b2 and 2mc\u00b2, respectively.\n\nWait, but wait, the electron and positron are moving towards each other, so their momenta are in opposite directions. Let's set up a coordinate system where the electron is moving along the positive x-direction (from left to right), and the positron is moving along the negative x-direction (from right to left). Or wait, the problem says the positron is moving from the right, so in the opposite direction to the electron.\n\nWait, the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis (let's say positive x-direction), and the positron is moving from the right, so negative x-direction.\n\nSo, their momenta are in opposite directions. Let me compute their relativistic momenta.\n\nThe relativistic momentum p is gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), and p = gamma m v. Alternatively, another formula is p = gamma m v, and since gamma is known, perhaps I can find p in terms of gamma and m.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's easier to express the momenta in terms of gamma and the rest mass. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is symmetric in a way, maybe I can compute the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision.\n\nSo, the total energy before collision is E_electron + E_positron = (gamma_e * mc\u00b2) + (gamma_p * mc\u00b2) = (4 + 2) mc\u00b2 = 6 mc\u00b2.\n\nThe momentum before collision is p_e - p_p, because the electron is moving in +x and positron in -x. So I need to calculate their momenta.\n\nWait, but since the positron is moving opposite, its momentum is in the opposite direction. So if the electron's momentum is p_e, the positron's momentum is p_p in the opposite direction, so the total momentum is p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, but wait, the positron has gamma_p = 2, so p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p. Similarly, p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e.\n\nBut how do I relate v_e and v_p? Since the Lorentz factors are given, perhaps I can find v in terms of gamma.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the relation p = gamma m v, and also, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)), I can write v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).\n\nHmm, let's compute the velocities for each.\n\nFor the electron, gamma_e =4. So v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(4^2)) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c*sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4) \u2248 0.9682 c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2^2)) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (c * sqrt(3))/2 \u2248 0.8660 c.\n\nBut wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its velocity is negative. So v_p = -0.8660 c.\n\nSo the momenta:\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 * m_e * (0.9682 c) = (4 * 0.9682) m_e c \u2248 3.8728 m_e c.\n\np_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * (-0.8660 c) = -1.732 m_e c.\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p? Wait, no. Because the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the total momentum is p_e (positive) + p_p (negative) = (3.8728) m_e c + (-1.732) m_e c = (3.8728 - 1.732) m_e c \u2248 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nWait, but wait, that's the total momentum before collision. So the system has a net momentum of about 2.1408 m_e c in the x-direction.\n\nWait, but after collision, the two photons are emitted. Photons carry momentum, which is E/c, and their direction determines the direction of momentum. Since the photons have the same energy, their momenta magnitudes are the same.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Photon 1 is moving in the upper-right direction, photon 2 in the lower-right direction.\n\nWait, upper-right and lower-right? So both are moving to the right? Or maybe upper-right and lower-right, but in different quadrants? Hmm, the question says their directions were measured as upper-right and lower-right. So their momenta are in the right direction but one is above the x-axis, the other below.\n\nWait, but the initial system had a net momentum in the positive x-direction. So the total momentum of the two photons must also be in the positive x-direction.\n\nEach photon's momentum is a vector. Let's denote their directions. Let's say photon 1 has an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 has an angle \u03c6 below the x-axis. Or perhaps symmetrically placed, but the problem states that the photons have the same energy, so their magnitudes are the same.\n\nWait, but the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So since E = h f = pc, each photon has momentum p = E/c. So the magnitudes of their momenta are the same. Let's call this p_photon = E/(c) for each.\n\nSo, the total momentum after collision is the vector sum of the two photons' momenta.\n\nSo, the total momentum in x-direction is p1x + p2x = (p_photon * cos\u03b8) + (p_photon * cos\u03c6).\n\nThe total momentum in y-direction is p1y + p2y = (p_photon * sin\u03b8) + (p_photon * sin\u03c6).\n\nBut from conservation of momentum, the total momentum after collision must equal the total before, which was approximately 2.1408 m_e c in the x-direction, and zero in the y-direction.\n\nSo, in the y-direction:\n\np1y + p2y = 0.\n\nSince the two photons have the same magnitude of momentum, and their angles are symmetric about the x-axis, perhaps? Wait, but one is upper-right, the other lower-right, so their y-components are opposite in sign.\n\nSo, p_photon (sin\u03b8) - p_photon (sin\u03c6) = 0. Wait, no. Wait, if photon 1 is at +\u03b8 and photon 2 at -\u03c6, but wait, the problem states one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So their y-components are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, perhaps the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. That would make their y-components cancel each other.\n\nSo, for example, if photon 1 is at angle \u03b8 above x-axis, photon 2 is at \u03b8 below x-axis. But wait, the problem says upper-right and lower-right, but not necessarily symmetric. Hmm, but the problem says that both photons have the same energy, but their directions are measured as upper-right and lower-right. So perhaps their angles are the same in magnitude but opposite in sign.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So maybe their y-components are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So when we add them, the y-components cancel, which is necessary because the initial system has zero net y-momentum.\n\nSo, let's say photon 1 has an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 has an angle \u03b8 below the x-axis. Then, their y-components would be p sin\u03b8 and -p sin\u03b8, which add to zero. That satisfies the y-direction momentum conservation.\n\nIn the x-direction, the sum of their x-components must equal the initial x-momentum.\n\nSo, the sum would be p (cos\u03b8) + p (cos\u03b8) = 2 p cos\u03b8.\n\nBecause both photons have the same energy, so same p.\n\nSo, 2 p cos\u03b8 = initial total momentum.\n\nWait, but the initial total momentum is (gamma_e * m_e v_e) + (gamma_p * m_e v_p). Wait, but wait, let me compute that accurately.\n\nWait, I think earlier I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate the total momentum before collision.\n\nThe electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.\n\nThe positron's momentum: since it's moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative: p_p = - gamma_p * m_e * v_p.\n\nSo, the total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p.\n\nWait, but wait, actually, the positron is moving in the negative x-direction, so its velocity is negative. So v_p = - (sqrt(3)/2 c), as I had earlier. So p_p is gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 m_e * (- sqrt(3)/2 c) = - sqrt(3) m_e c \u2248 -1.732 m_e c.\n\np_e is 4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = 4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e * sqrt(15) c \u2248 3.872 m_e c.\n\nSo, p_e = 3.872 m_e c, p_p = -1.732 m_e c.\n\nSo, total p_initial = 3.872 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c = (3.872 - 1.732) m_e c = 2.140 m_e c.\n\nSo, in the x-direction, the photons' total momentum must be 2.140 m_e c.\n\nEach photon's momentum is E/(c), and since both have the same energy, E1 = E2 = E.\n\nSo, each photon has p_photon = E/c.\n\nSo, in the x-direction, the sum is (E/c) * cos\u03b8 + (E/c) * cos\u03b8 = 2 (E/c) cos\u03b8.\n\nThis must equal the initial momentum, which is 2.140 m_e c.\n\nSo:\n\n2 (E/c) cos\u03b8 = 2.140 m_e c.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 E cos\u03b8 = 2.140 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, the total energy before collision is 6 m_e c\u00b2 (since each contributes 4 m_e c\u00b2 and 2 m_e c\u00b2 respectively). So, the sum of the photons' energies must be 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nEach photon has energy E, so 2 E = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAh, so E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting back into the equation:\n\n2 * (3 m_e c\u00b2) * cos\u03b8 = 2.140 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, that gives:\n\n6 m_e c\u00b2 cos\u03b8 = 2.140 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c\u00b2:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = 2.140 \u2192 cos\u03b8 = 2.140 /6 \u2248 0.3567.\n\nSo, \u03b8 = arccos(0.3567) \u2248 69 degrees. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cos(theta) is 0.3567, so theta is about 69 degrees above the x-axis for photon 1, and 69 degrees below for photon 2.\n\nWait, but if both have the same angle magnitude but opposite signs, then the angle between them would be 2 theta. Because one is at theta above, the other at theta below. So the total angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nSo, theta is about 69 degrees, so the angle between the photons is about 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138, which matches.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let's recompute the initial momentum.\n\nElectron: gamma =4, v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c \u2248 0.9682 c.\n\np_e = gamma * m_e * v_e = 4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= m_e * sqrt(15) c \u2248 3.872 m_e c.\n\nPositron: gamma=2, v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c \u2248 0.866 c.\n\np_p = gamma * m_e * v_p = 2 m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c )= m_e * sqrt(3) c \u2248 1.732 m_e c.\n\nSince the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative: p_p = -1.732 m_e c.\n\nSo, total momentum p_initial = 3.872 m_e c -1.732 m_e c = 2.140 m_e c.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, in the x-direction, the photons' momenta sum to 2.140 m_e c.\n\nEach photon's momentum is E/c. Since E=3 m_e c\u00b2, each has p_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c = 3 m_e c.\n\nWait, wait a second, that's different. Oh, because E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2, so p_photon = E/c = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo each photon has p_photon =3 m_e c.\n\nSo, the sum in x-direction is 3 m_e c (cos\u03b8) + 3 m_e c (cos\u03b8) =6 m_e c cos\u03b8.\n\nSet equal to p_initial:\n\n6 m_e c cos\u03b8 = 2.140 m_e c.\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = 2.140 \u2192 cos\u03b8 = 2.140 /6 \u2248 0.3567.\n\nWhich gives \u03b8 \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nSo each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis, respectively.\n\nSo the angle between them is 69 +69 =138 degrees.\n\nWhich is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons colliding and producing photons. Hmm, I need to figure out the angle between the two photons. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nAlright, so an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy and their directions are measured as upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.\n\nWait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is the factor by which time dilation and length contraction occur. For the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, it's 2.\n\nBut wait, when they annihilate, they produce two photons. Since energy and momentum must be conserved, I should probably think about conservation laws here. Also, the photons have the same energy, so each has energy E.\n\nLet me think about the system's total energy and momentum before the collision. Then I can set that equal to the total after, which is the two photons.\n\nFirst, let's find the rest mass energy of the electron and positron. Oh wait, since they are each other's antiparticles, their rest masses are the same. The rest energy of an electron is mc\u00b2, which is about 0.511 MeV. But when we're dealing with high speeds, their energies will be higher due to the gamma factor.\n\nSo for the electron, its total energy is gamma * mc\u00b2. Similarly for the positron. Since gamma_e is 4 and gamma_p is 2, their energies are 4mc\u00b2 and 2mc\u00b2, respectively.\n\nWait, but wait, the electron and positron are moving towards each other, so their momenta are in opposite directions. Let's set up a coordinate system where the electron is moving along the positive x-direction (from left to right), and the positron is moving along the negative x-direction (from right to left). Or wait, the problem says the positron is moving from the right, so in the opposite direction to the electron.\n\nWait, the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis (let's say positive x-direction), and the positron is moving from the right, so negative x-direction.\n\nSo, their momenta are in opposite directions. Let me compute their relativistic momenta.\n\nThe relativistic momentum p is gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), and p = gamma m v. Alternatively, another formula is p = gamma m v, and since gamma is known, perhaps I can find p in terms of gamma and m.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's easier to express the momenta in terms of gamma and the rest mass. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is symmetric in a way, maybe I can compute the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision.\n\nSo, the total energy before collision is E_electron + E_positron = (gamma_e * mc\u00b2) + (gamma_p * mc\u00b2) = (4 + 2) mc\u00b2 = 6 mc\u00b2.\n\nThe momentum before collision is p_e - p_p, because the electron is moving in +x and positron in -x. So I need to calculate their momenta.\n\nWait, but since the positron is moving opposite, its momentum is in the opposite direction. So if the electron's momentum is p_e, the positron's momentum is p_p in the opposite direction, so the total momentum is p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, but wait, the positron has gamma_p = 2, so p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p. Similarly, p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e.\n\nBut how do I relate v_e and v_p? Since the Lorentz factors are given, perhaps I can find v in terms of gamma.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the relation p = gamma m v, and also, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)), I can write v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).\n\nHmm, let's compute the velocities for each.\n\nFor the electron, gamma_e =4. So v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(4^2)) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c*sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4) \u2248 0.9682 c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2^2)) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (c * sqrt(3))/2 \u2248 0.8660 c.\n\nBut wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its velocity is negative. So v_p = -0.8660 c.\n\nSo the momenta:\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 * m_e * (0.9682 c) = (4 * 0.9682) m_e c \u2248 3.8728 m_e c.\n\np_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * (-0.8660 c) = -1.732 m_e c.\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p? Wait, no. Because the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the total momentum is p_e (positive) + p_p (negative) = (3.8728) m_e c + (-1.732) m_e c = (3.8728 - 1.732) m_e c \u2248 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nWait, but wait, that's the total momentum before collision. So the system has a net momentum of about 2.1408 m_e c in the x-direction.\n\nWait, but after collision, the two photons are emitted. Photons carry momentum, which is E/c, and their direction determines the direction of momentum. Since the photons have the same energy, their momenta magnitudes are the same.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Photon 1 is moving in the upper-right direction, photon 2 in the lower-right direction.\n\nWait, upper-right and lower-right? So both are moving to the right? Or maybe upper-right and lower-right, but in different quadrants? Hmm, the question says their directions were measured as upper-right and lower-right. So their momenta are in the right direction but one is above the x-axis, the other below.\n\nWait, but the initial system had a net momentum in the positive x-direction. So the total momentum of the two photons must also be in the positive x-direction.\n\nEach photon's momentum is a vector. Let's denote their directions. Let's say photon 1 has an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 has an angle \u03c6 below the x-axis. Or perhaps symmetrically placed, but the problem states that the photons have the same energy, so their magnitudes are the same.\n\nWait, but the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So since E = h f = pc, each photon has momentum p = E/c. So the magnitudes of their momenta are the same. Let's call this p_photon = E/(c) for each.\n\nSo, the total momentum after collision is the vector sum of the two photons' momenta.\n\nSo, the total momentum in x-direction is p1x + p2x = (p_photon * cos\u03b8) + (p_photon * cos\u03c6).\n\nThe total momentum in y-direction is p1y + p2y = (p_photon * sin\u03b8) + (p_photon * sin\u03c6).\n\nBut from conservation of momentum, the total momentum after collision must equal the total before, which was approximately 2.1408 m_e c in the x-direction, and zero in the y-direction.\n\nSo, in the y-direction:\n\np1y + p2y = 0.\n\nSince the two photons have the same magnitude of momentum, and their angles are symmetric about the x-axis, perhaps? Wait, but one is upper-right, the other lower-right, so their y-components are opposite in sign.\n\nSo, p_photon (sin\u03b8) - p_photon (sin\u03c6) = 0. Wait, no. Wait, if photon 1 is at +\u03b8 and photon 2 at -\u03c6, but wait, the problem states one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So their y-components are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, perhaps the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. That would make their y-components cancel each other.\n\nSo, for example, if photon 1 is at angle \u03b8 above x-axis, photon 2 is at \u03b8 below x-axis. But wait, the problem says upper-right and lower-right, but not necessarily symmetric. Hmm, but the problem says that both photons have the same energy, but their directions are measured as upper-right and lower-right. So perhaps their angles are the same in magnitude but opposite in sign.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So maybe their y-components are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So when we add them, the y-components cancel, which is necessary because the initial system has zero net y-momentum.\n\nSo, let's say photon 1 has an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 has an angle \u03b8 below the x-axis. Then, their y-components would be p sin\u03b8 and -p sin\u03b8, which add to zero. That satisfies the y-direction momentum conservation.\n\nIn the x-direction, the sum of their x-components must equal the initial x-momentum.\n\nSo, the sum would be p (cos\u03b8) + p (cos\u03b8) = 2 p cos\u03b8.\n\nBecause both photons have the same energy, so same p.\n\nSo, 2 p cos\u03b8 = initial total momentum.\n\nWait, but the initial total momentum is (gamma_e * m_e v_e) + (gamma_p * m_e v_p). Wait, but wait, let me compute that accurately.\n\nWait, I think earlier I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate the total momentum before collision.\n\nThe electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.\n\nThe positron's momentum: since it's moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative: p_p = - gamma_p * m_e * v_p.\n\nSo, the total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p.\n\nWait, but wait, actually, the positron is moving in the negative x-direction, so its velocity is negative. So v_p = - (sqrt(3)/2 c), as I had earlier. So p_p is gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 m_e * (- sqrt(3)/2 c) = - sqrt(3) m_e c \u2248 -1.732 m_e c.\n\np_e is 4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = 4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e * sqrt(15) c \u2248 3.872 m_e c.\n\nSo, p_e = 3.872 m_e c, p_p = -1.732 m_e c.\n\nSo, total p_initial = 3.872 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c = (3.872 - 1.732) m_e c = 2.140 m_e c.\n\nSo, in the x-direction, the photons' total momentum must be 2.140 m_e c.\n\nEach photon's momentum is E/(c), and since both have the same energy, E1 = E2 = E.\n\nSo, each photon has p_photon = E/c.\n\nSo, in the x-direction, the sum is (E/c) * cos\u03b8 + (E/c) * cos\u03b8 = 2 (E/c) cos\u03b8.\n\nThis must equal the initial momentum, which is 2.140 m_e c.\n\nSo:\n\n2 (E/c) cos\u03b8 = 2.140 m_e c.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 E cos\u03b8 = 2.140 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, the total energy before collision is 6 m_e c\u00b2 (since each contributes 4 m_e c\u00b2 and 2 m_e c\u00b2 respectively). So, the sum of the photons' energies must be 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nEach photon has energy E, so 2 E = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAh, so E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting back into the equation:\n\n2 * (3 m_e c\u00b2) * cos\u03b8 = 2.140 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, that gives:\n\n6 m_e c\u00b2 cos\u03b8 = 2.140 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c\u00b2:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = 2.140 \u2192 cos\u03b8 = 2.140 /6 \u2248 0.3567.\n\nSo, \u03b8 = arccos(0.3567) \u2248 69 degrees. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cos(theta) is 0.3567, so theta is about 69 degrees above the x-axis for photon 1, and 69 degrees below for photon 2.\n\nWait, but if both have the same angle magnitude but opposite signs, then the angle between them would be 2 theta. Because one is at theta above, the other at theta below. So the total angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nSo, theta is about 69 degrees, so the angle between the photons is about 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138, which matches.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let's recompute the initial momentum.\n\nElectron: gamma =4, v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c \u2248 0.9682 c.\n\np_e = gamma * m_e * v_e = 4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= m_e * sqrt(15) c \u2248 3.872 m_e c.\n\nPositron: gamma=2, v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c \u2248 0.866 c.\n\np_p = gamma * m_e * v_p = 2 m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c )= m_e * sqrt(3) c \u2248 1.732 m_e c.\n\nSince the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative: p_p = -1.732 m_e c.\n\nSo, total momentum p_initial = 3.872 m_e c -1.732 m_e c = 2.140 m_e c.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, in the x-direction, the photons' momenta sum to 2.140 m_e c.\n\nEach photon's momentum is E/c. Since E=3 m_e c\u00b2, each has p_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c = 3 m_e c.\n\nWait, wait a second, that's different. Oh, because E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2, so p_photon = E/c = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo each photon has p_photon =3 m_e c.\n\nSo, the sum in x-direction is 3 m_e c (cos\u03b8) + 3 m_e c (cos\u03b8) =6 m_e c cos\u03b8.\n\nSet equal to p_initial:\n\n6 m_e c cos\u03b8 = 2.140 m_e c.\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = 2.140 \u2192 cos\u03b8 = 2.140 /6 \u2248 0.3567.\n\nWhich gives \u03b8 \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nSo each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis, respectively.\n\nSo the angle between them is 69 +69 =138 degrees.\n\nWhich is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate to produce two photons with equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.\n\n### Step 1: Conservation of Energy\nThe total energy before the collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. Using the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\), the total energy is:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e m c^2 + \\gamma_p m c^2 = (4 + 2) m c^2 = 6 m c^2\n\\]\n\nAfter the collision, this energy is entirely converted into the energy of the two photons. Since the photons have equal energy, each photon has energy:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m c^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Conservation of Momentum\nThe total momentum before the collision is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. The relativistic momentum is given by:\n\n\\[\np = \\gamma m v\n\\]\n\nFor the electron (\\( \\gamma_e = 4 \\)) and positron (\\( \\gamma_p = 2 \\)), their velocities are calculated as:\n\n\\[\nv_e = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_e^2}} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{16}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c \\approx 0.968 c\n\\]\n\\[\nv_p = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_p^2}} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c \\approx 0.866 c\n\\]\n\nThe momenta are:\n\n\\[\np_e = \\gamma_e m v_e = 4 m \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c = m \\sqrt{15} c \\approx 3.872 m c\n\\]\n\\[\np_p = \\gamma_p m v_p = 2 m \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c = m \\sqrt{3} c \\approx 1.732 m c\n\\]\n\nSince the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative:\n\n\\[\np_{\\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = 3.872 m c - 1.732 m c = 2.140 m c\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Momentum of Photons\nAfter the collision, the photons carry the total momentum. Each photon has energy \\( E_{\\text{photon}} = 3 m c^2 \\), so their momentum magnitudes are:\n\n\\[\np_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{photon}}}{c} = \\frac{3 m c^2}{c} = 3 m c\n\\]\n\nThe photons are emitted symmetrically about the x-axis, one moving at an angle \\( \\theta \\) above the x-axis and the other at \\( \\theta \\) below the x-axis.

I think the Lorentz factor is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), but maybe I don't need the actual velocity here. Instead, maybe I can find their relativistic momenta.\n\nOh right, the relativistic momentum p is gamma * m * v. But wait, another formula I remember is that p can also be calculated as gamma m v, but since gamma is given, perhaps it's better to express their momenta in terms of gamma and rest mass.\n\nWait, the rest mass of electron and positron is the same, right? So m_e for both.\n\nSo the electron is moving to the right (from left), so let's say positive direction. The positron is moving to the left (from right), so negative direction. So their momenta will be in opposite directions.\n\nSo let's compute their momenta.\n\nElectron: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But wait, I can also write it in terms of gamma and the rest mass. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)), but I'm not sure if I need v.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the total momentum before annihilation must equal the total momentum after, because momentum is conserved.\n\nWait, but photons have momentum. Each photon's momentum is E/c, and the direction is determined by their movement.\n\nSince the two photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their momenta vectors are in those directions. So their x-components would add up, and their y-components would cancel each other out? Or maybe not, since the problem states that the two photons have the same energy.\n\nWait, same energy. So E1 = E2 = E.\n\nLet me model this. Let's set up a coordinate system where the initial motion is along the x-axis.\n\nBefore annihilation, the total momentum is the sum of the electron and positron momenta.\n\nElectron (from left, moving right): its momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.\n\nWait, but maybe I should compute the momentum in terms of gamma and m. Because gamma is given, perhaps I can find the momentum without knowing v. Because for a particle moving at speed v, the momentum p = gamma m v. But how else can I express that?\n\nWait, another thought: The rest energy is m c\u00b2. The total energy is gamma m c\u00b2. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.\n\nWait, but for an electron and a positron, their rest masses are the same, so m_e for both. So their energies are gamma_e m c\u00b2 and gamma_p m c\u00b2, where gamma_p is 2.\n\nWait, so their momenta are p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e, and p_p = gamma_p m_p v_p. But since m_e = m_p, and v_e and v_p are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the velocities. Maybe it's better to express their momenta in terms of their gamma factors.\n\nWait, another formula: For a particle, the momentum p can also be expressed as gamma m v, and the energy is gamma m c\u00b2. So, E = gamma m c\u00b2, p = gamma m v. Alternatively, p = (E / c\u00b2) v.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute the momentum of each particle.\n\nWait, let's compute their momenta.\n\nElectron: gamma_e =4. So p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.\n\nSimilarly, positron: gamma_p=2, so p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p.\n\nBut since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its velocity is negative. So, p_p is negative.\n\nWait, but I don't know the actual velocities. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can relate their velocities through their gamma factors. Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), so for each particle, v can be written in terms of gamma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the momenta using gamma and the rest mass. Because p = gamma m v, but I can write v in terms of gamma.\n\nWait, let's think: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let me solve for v.\n\ngamma\u00b2 = 1/(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/gamma\u00b2 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/gamma\u00b2 \u2192 v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo for the electron, gamma_e =4. So v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c*sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4) \u2248 0.968 c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 -1/4) = c*sqrt(3/4)= (c * sqrt(3))/2 \u2248 0.866 c.\n\nWait, but wait: the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left, which is negative. So when I calculate p_p, it will be negative.\n\nSo, let me compute p_e and p_p.\n\np_e = gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e (c * sqrt(15)/4) )= m_e c sqrt(15).\n\nSimilarly, p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e (c * sqrt(3)/2 ) = m_e c sqrt(3).\n\nBut since v_p is in the opposite direction, p_p is negative. So p_p = - m_e c sqrt(3).\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure about the signs. The electron is moving to the right (positive x), and the positron to the left (negative x). So the electron's momentum is positive, the positron's is negative.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = m_e c [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ].\n\nWait, but let me compute the numerical values to see.\n\nsqrt(15) \u2248 3.872, sqrt(3)\u22481.732. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 2.140.\n\nSo total initial momentum p_initial \u2248 m_e c * 2.140.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to carry the actual numerical values or just keep it symbolic. Hmm.\n\nNow, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right.\n\nSo, let's model each photon's momentum.\n\nPhoton 1: let's say it's moving at an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis. Photon 2: moving at an angle \u03b8 below the x-axis, but wait, the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So maybe their angles are symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nWait, but the problem says they have the same energy. Since photon energy E = pc, their momenta magnitudes are equal (since p = E/c). So each photon has momentum p_photon = E/(c).\n\nSo, for photon 1: its momentum components are p1x = p_photon * cos(theta), p1y = p_photon * sin(theta).\n\nPhoton 2: moving lower-right, so p2x = p_photon * cos(theta), p2y = -p_photon * sin(theta).\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says one photon is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So perhaps the angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nBut wait, in that case, their y-components would be opposite, but their x-components would be the same. So the total y-momentum after would be zero, which makes sense because the initial y-momentum was zero.\n\nSo, the total x-momentum after annihilation is p1x + p2x = 2 p_photon cos(theta).\n\nBut the total momentum before was m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), which is approximately 2.14 m_e c.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the positron's gamma is 2, so its momentum is p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p. But v_p is negative, so p_p is negative.\n\nSo, p_initial = p_e + p_p = (gamma_e m_e v_e) + (gamma_p m_e v_p) ) = m_e ( gamma_e v_e + gamma_p v_p )\n\nBut v_e is positive, v_p is negative.\n\nSo substituting in the values:\n\nv_e = c sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.968c.\n\nv_p = -c sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 -0.866c.\n\nSo:\n\ngamma_e v_e =4 * (c sqrt(15)/4 )= c sqrt(15).\n\ngamma_p v_p = 2 * (-c sqrt(3)/2 )= -c sqrt(3).\n\nSo p_initial = m_e ( c sqrt(15) - c sqrt(3) ) = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nSo p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nAfter annihilation, the photons' total momentum is p_photon1 + p_photon2.\n\nEach photon's momentum is E_photon/c, and their directions are symmetric. So:\n\np1 = (E/c) (cos(theta), sin(theta)).\n\np2 = (E/c) (cos(theta), -sin(theta)).\n\nSo summing them, the y-components cancel, and the x-components add.\n\nTotal p_final = (2E cos(theta)/c) i.\n\nMomentum conservation says p_initial = p_final.\n\nSo,\n\nm_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = (2 E cos(theta)/c ) * c.\n\nWait, because c is the speed, so let me compute:\n\nWait, the equation is:\n\nm_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) = (2 E cos(theta) ) / c * c.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because each photon's momentum is E/c in the x direction? Wait, no. Photon momentum is E/c in the direction of motion. So for photon 1, the x-component is E/c * cos(theta), and same for photon 2. So total x-momentum is 2 E cos(theta) / c.\n\nWait, but p_initial is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo,\n\nm_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) = (2 E cos(theta) ) / c.\n\nWait, no, wait: the total momentum after is 2 E cos(theta) / c, but the initial momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the units.\n\nWait, E_photon = p_photon c.\n\nSo p_photon = E_photon / c.\n\nEach photon's x-component is (E/c) cos(theta), so sum is 2 (E/c) cos(theta).\n\nSo, the total momentum after is 2 (E cos(theta) ) / c.\n\nBut the initial momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSetting them equal:\n\nm_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) = 2 (E cos(theta)) / c.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the left side has units of mass \u00d7 velocity (since m_e c is kg\u00b7m/s), and the right side has (energy \u00d7 cos(theta)) / velocity. Wait, energy E is in joules, which is kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2, so (E/c) would be kg m/s. So 2 (E/c) cos(theta) would be kg m/s. So both sides have same units.\n\nBut let's write the equation correctly.\n\nm_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 (E cos(theta)) / c.\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\nm_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) = 2 E cos(theta).\n\nHmm. So,\n\nE cos(theta) = [ m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.\n\nNow, the other aspect is energy conservation. The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nElectron's energy: E_e = gamma_e m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nPositron's energy: E_p = gamma_p m_e c\u00b2 = 2 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo total energy before: 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 =6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the photons have energies E each, so total energy is 2 E.\n\nSo,\n\n2 E =6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E =3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo, E =3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nNow, plug this into the previous equation:\n\nE cos(theta) = [ m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.\n\nSo,\n\n3 m_e c\u00b2 cos(theta) = [ m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c\u00b2:\n\n3 cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 2.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / (6).\n\nLet me compute the numerator numerically.\n\nsqrt(15) \u22483.872, sqrt(3)\u22481.732.\n\nSo numerator\u22483.872 -1.732=2.140.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta)=2.140 /6 \u22480.3567.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.3567).\n\nCalculating that: arccos(0.3567) is approximately 69 degrees. Because cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)=0.342, so 0.3567 is between 70 and 69.\n\nWait, 0.3567: let's see:\n\nAt 69 degrees: cos(69)=approx 0.3584.\n\nAt 69 degrees: about 0.3584.\n\nWait, the value is 0.3567, which is just a bit less than 0.3584. So theta is approximately 69 degrees.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem states that the two photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. So each photon makes an angle theta with the x-axis, one above and one below.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 2 theta.\n\nSo 2 theta \u2248 2 *69 =138 degrees.\n\nWait, looking at the options: option C is 138. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, sqrt(15) is about 3.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)=2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093/6\u22480.35682.\n\nSo cos(theta)=0.35682. So theta\u224869 degrees.\n\nSo the angle between them is 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138.\n\nWait, but another thought: could the angle between the photons be 2 times theta? Because each is at theta above and below the x-axis, so the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So 2*69=138.\n\nSo the answer should be C) 138.\n",

So the total y-momentum after would be zero, which makes sense because the initial y-momentum was zero.\n\nSo, the total x-momentum after annihilation is p1x + p2x = 2 p_photon cos(theta).\n\nBut the total momentum before was m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), which is approximately 2.14 m_e c.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the positron's gamma is 2, so its momentum is p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p. But v_p is negative, so p_p is negative.\n\nSo, p_initial = p_e + p_p = (gamma_e m_e v_e) + (gamma_p m_e v_p) ) = m_e ( gamma_e v_e + gamma_p v_p )\n\nBut v_e is positive, v_p is negative.\n\nSo substituting in the values:\n\nv_e = c sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.968c.\n\nv_p = -c sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 -0.866c.\n\nSo:\n\ngamma_e v_e =4 * (c sqrt(15)/4 )= c sqrt(15).\n\ngamma_p v_p = 2 * (-c sqrt(3)/2 )= -c sqrt(3).\n\nSo p_initial = m_e ( c sqrt(15) - c sqrt(3) ) = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nSo p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nAfter annihilation, the photons' total momentum is p_photon1 + p_photon2.\n\nEach photon's momentum is E_photon/c, and their directions are symmetric. So:\n\np1 = (E/c) (cos(theta), sin(theta)).\n\np2 = (E/c) (cos(theta), -sin(theta)).\n\nSo summing them, the y-components cancel, and the x-components add.\n\nTotal p_final = (2E cos(theta)/c) i.\n\nMomentum conservation says p_initial = p_final.\n\nSo,\n\nm_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = (2 E cos(theta)/c ) * c.\n\nWait, because c is the speed, so let me compute:\n\nWait, the equation is:\n\nm_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) = (2 E cos(theta) ) / c * c.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because each photon's momentum is E/c in the x direction? Wait, no. Photon momentum is E/c in the direction of motion. So for photon 1, the x-component is E/c * cos(theta), and same for photon 2. So total x-momentum is 2 E cos(theta) / c.\n\nWait, but p_initial is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo,\n\nm_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) = (2 E cos(theta) ) / c.\n\nWait, no, wait: the total momentum after is 2 E cos(theta) / c, but the initial momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the units.\n\nWait, E_photon = p_photon c.\n\nSo p_photon = E_photon / c.\n\nEach photon's x-component is (E/c) cos(theta), so sum is 2 (E/c) cos(theta).\n\nSo, the total momentum after is 2 (E cos(theta) ) / c.\n\nBut the initial momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSetting them equal:\n\nm_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) = 2 (E cos(theta)) / c.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the left side has units of mass \u00d7 velocity (since m_e c is kg\u00b7m/s), and the right side has (energy \u00d7 cos(theta)) / velocity. Wait, energy E is in joules, which is kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2, so (E/c) would be kg m/s. So 2 (E/c) cos(theta) would be kg m/s. So both sides have same units.\n\nBut let's write the equation correctly.\n\nm_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 (E cos(theta)) / c.\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\nm_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) = 2 E cos(theta).\n\nHmm. So,\n\nE cos(theta) = [ m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.\n\nNow, the other aspect is energy conservation. The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nElectron's energy: E_e = gamma_e m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nPositron's energy: E_p = gamma_p m_e c\u00b2 = 2 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo total energy before: 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 =6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the photons have energies E each, so total energy is 2 E.\n\nSo,\n\n2 E =6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E =3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo, E =3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nNow, plug this into the previous equation:\n\nE cos(theta) = [ m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.\n\nSo,\n\n3 m_e c\u00b2 cos(theta) = [ m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c\u00b2:\n\n3 cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 2.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / (6).\n\nLet me compute the numerator numerically.\n\nsqrt(15) \u22483.872, sqrt(3)\u22481.732.\n\nSo numerator\u22483.872 -1.732=2.140.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta)=2.140 /6 \u22480.3567.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.3567).\n\nCalculating that: arccos(0.3567) is approximately 69 degrees. Because cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)=0.342, so 0.3567 is between 70 and 69.\n\nWait, 0.3567: let's see:\n\nAt 69 degrees: cos(69)=approx 0.3584.\n\nAt 69 degrees: about 0.3584.\n\nWait, the value is 0.3567, which is just a bit less than 0.3584. So theta is approximately 69 degrees.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem states that the two photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. So each photon makes an angle theta with the x-axis, one above and one below.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 2 theta.\n\nSo 2 theta \u2248 2 *69 =138 degrees.\n\nWait, looking at the options: option C is 138. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, sqrt(15) is about 3.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)=2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093/6\u22480.35682.\n\nSo cos(theta)=0.35682. So theta\u224869 degrees.\n\nSo the angle between them is 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138.\n\nWait, but another thought: could the angle between the photons be 2 times theta? Because each is at theta above and below the x-axis, so the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So 2*69=138.\n\nSo the answer should be C) 138.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of momentum and energy principles. The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy, moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. The goal is to determine the angle between the two photons.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Momentum\nThe electron and positron move along the x-axis with Lorentz factors \\( \\gamma_e = 4 \\) and \\( \\gamma_p = 2 \\), respectively. Their velocities are calculated using the relation \\( v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} \\):\n- For the electron: \\( v_e = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4^2}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{16}} = \\frac{c \\sqrt{15}}{4} \\).\n- For the positron: \\( v_p = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2^2}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{c \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nThe relativistic momentum of each particle is \\( p = \\gamma m v \\). Since the positron moves in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative:\n- Electron momentum: \\( p_e = \\gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e \\cdot \\frac{c \\sqrt{15}}{4} = m_e c \\sqrt{15} \\).\n- Positron momentum: \\( p_p = \\gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e \\cdot \\frac{c \\sqrt{3}}{2} = m_e c \\sqrt{3} \\), but since it is negative, \\( p_p = -m_e c \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nThe total initial momentum is:\n\\[\np_{\\text{initial}} = p_e + p_p = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Final Momentum (Photons)\nEach photon has energy \\( E \\) and momentum \\( p_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E}{c} \\). The photons move symmetrically above and below the x-axis, making angles \\( \\theta \\) with the x-axis. Their momentum components are:\n- Photon 1: \\( p_{1x} = \\frac{E}{c} \\cos\\theta, \\, p_{1y} = \\frac{E}{c} \\sin\\theta \\).\n- Photon 2: \\( p_{2x} = \\frac{E}{c} \\cos\\theta, \\, p_{2y} = -\\frac{E}{c} \\sin\\theta \\).\n\nThe total momentum after annihilation is:\n\\[\np_{\\text{final}} = p_{1x} + p_{2x} = \\frac{2E}{c} \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{i}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Conservation of Momentum\nEquating initial and final momenta along the x-axis:\n\\[\nm_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) = \\frac{2E}{c} \\cos\\theta.\n\\]\nRearranging:\n\\[\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})}{2E}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Energy Conservation\nThe total energy before annihilation is the sum of the electron and positron energies:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{initial}} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.\n\\]\nAfter annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the photon energies:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{final}} = 2E.\n\\]\nEquating energies:\n\\[\n2E = 6 m_e c^2 \\implies E = 3 m_e c^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\( \\cos\\theta \\)\nSubstitute \\( E = 3 m_e c^2 \\) into the momentum equation:\n\\[\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})}{2 \\cdot 3 m_e c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}.\n\\]\nNumerically:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.872, \\, \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732, \\, \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} \\approx 2.140.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{2.140}{6} \\approx 0.3567.\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n\\theta \\approx \\arccos(0.3567) \\approx 69^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Angle Between Photons\nThe photons are symmetrically placed above and below the x-axis, so the angle between them is:\n\\[\n\\phi = 2\\theta \\approx 2 \\cdot 69^\\circ = 138^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.\n\nANSWER: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Oh right, when matter and antimatter particles annihilate, they produce gamma photons usually. \n\nSo, the setup is: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured\u2014one is upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.\n\nWait, Lorentz factors are gamma, right? So gamma for electron is 4, and for positron it's 2. I remember that the Lorentz factor relates to the time dilation and length contraction in relativity. But here, since they're moving towards each other, I need to consider their energies and momenta.\n\nElectrons and positrons have the same mass, right? So mass m is the same for both. The positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, so same mass but opposite charge.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total energy and momentum before the collision. Because in relativity, the conservation of energy and momentum must hold.\n\nSo for the electron: gamma is 4. Its energy is gamma * m * c\u00b2. Similarly, the positron's energy is gamma * m * c\u00b2, which is 2 * m * c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but since the positron is moving to the left (from the right), maybe I should assign directions. Let me think: the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nSo their momenta would be in opposite directions as well. Let me set up a coordinate system where the electron is moving in the positive x-direction, and the positron in the negative x-direction.\n\nThe momentum p is gamma * m * v. But velocity is a vector. So for the electron, p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e in +x. For the positron, p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p in -x direction. Wait, but v is in opposite direction, so p_p would be negative.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the magnitudes and then assign directions. So for the electron, |p_e| = gamma_e * m * v_e. Similarly for the positron, |p_p| = gamma_p * m * v_p. But since they're moving towards each other, the directions are opposite.\n\nWait, but since they're annihilating, their combined energy and momentum must equal the photons' energy and momentum. Because energy and momentum are conserved.\n\nSo let's compute the total energy and momentum before collision.\n\nElectron's energy: E_e = gamma_e * m c\u00b2 = 4 m c\u00b2.\n\nPositron's energy: E_p = gamma_p * m c\u00b2 = 2 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo total energy E_total = 4 m c\u00b2 + 2 m c\u00b2 = 6 m c\u00b2.\n\nNow, momentum. For the electron, p_e = gamma_e * m v_e. Let's find v_e in terms of c. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So gamma_e is 4, so 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let's square both sides: 16 = 1/(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/16 \u2192 v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 15/16 \u2192 v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(\u221a15)/4 \u2248 0.968 c.\n\nSimilarly for the positron, gamma_p is 2. So 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 4 = 1/(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/4 \u2192 v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 3/4 \u2192 v_p = (sqrt(3)/2) c \u2248 0.866 c.\n\nSo the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m v_e = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m c sqrt(15). Because 4 cancels with 4. So sqrt(15) is about 3.872, so p_e is around 3.872 m c.\n\nPositron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m v_p. But since the positron is moving to the left (negative x), p_p is negative. So p_p = 2 * m * (sqrt(3)/2) c = m c sqrt(3). But direction is negative x, so p_p = - m c sqrt(3).\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify the directions. The electron is moving from left to right (positive x), so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving from right to left (negative x), so its momentum is negative. So yes, p_p is negative.\n\nSo total momentum p_total = p_e + p_p = (m c sqrt(15)) + ( - m c sqrt(3) ) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nHmm, let me compute that numerically to get an idea. sqrt(15) is approx 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So 3.872 - 1.732 \u2248 2.14. So p_total \u2248 2.14 m c.\n\nWait, but I think I should keep it symbolic for now. So p_total = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, after the collision, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon. Given that both photons have the same energy, E1 = E2 = E_photon.\n\nPhotons carry momentum, which is E/c, and their momentum direction is the same as their direction of travel. Also, for photons, the magnitude of momentum is E/c.\n\nSo the total energy after collision is 2 E_photon, which must equal the total energy before collision, which is 6 m c\u00b2. So 2 E_photon = 6 m c\u00b2 \u2192 E_photon = 3 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo each photon has energy 3 m c\u00b2. That's a lot of energy for a photon, but okay.\n\nNow, the momentum of each photon is E_photon / c = 3 m c\u00b2 / c = 3 m c. So each photon has a momentum of 3 m c. But their directions are one upper-right and one lower-right. So their momenta have both x and y components.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Photon 1 is moving in the upper-right direction, so its momentum has positive x and positive y components. Photon 2 is moving in the lower-right direction, so positive x and negative y components.\n\nSo for photon 1: p1x = 3 m c cos(theta), p1y = 3 m c sin(theta).\n\nPhoton 2: p2x = 3 m c cos(phi), p2y = -3 m c sin(phi).\n\nWait, but the problem states that both photons are moving in the right direction, but one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their x-components are positive. The angles would be measured from the x-axis. So theta and phi are angles above and below the x-axis, respectively.\n\nNow, the total momentum after collision must equal the total momentum before collision.\n\nTotal x-momentum after: p1x + p2x = 3 m c (cos(theta) + cos(phi)).\n\nTotal y-momentum after: p1y + p2y = 3 m c (sin(theta) - sin(phi)).\n\nBut the total momentum before collision is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c in the x-direction. There's no y-momentum before, because both particles were moving along the x-axis. So the y-momentum after must be zero.\n\nSo, the y-momentum equation:\n\n3 m c (sin(theta) - sin(phi)) = 0 \u2192 sin(theta) = sin(phi).\n\nHmm, sin(theta) equals sin(phi). So theta could equal phi, or theta = 180 - phi, but considering their directions, which are upper-right and lower-right, theta is positive and phi is positive, but perhaps one is theta and the other is (180 - theta) in the lower hemisphere. Wait, no, because both are in the right direction.\n\nWait, for a photon moving in lower-right, phi is measured from the x-axis downward. So if phi is the angle below the x-axis, then sin(phi) is negative. Wait, but in the setup, I considered p2y as negative because it's downward. So when I wrote p2y = -3 m c sin(phi), I think phi is the angle from the x-axis downward. So sin(phi) is positive if phi is measured downward.\n\nWait, perhaps I should denote the angles more precisely. Let's say photon 1 makes an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle theta below the x-axis. So phi = theta. But then sin(theta) = sin(phi), but for one, it's positive and the other negative. Wait, no, because in that case, the y-components would be p1y = 3 m c sin(theta) and p2y = -3 m c sin(theta). Then, p1y + p2y = 0, which satisfies the y-momentum conservation.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So perhaps the two photons have symmetric angles above and below the x-axis. So their y-components cancel each other out.\n\nSo if that's the case, then the angles theta and phi are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So theta = phi in terms of their magnitudes, but one is positive and the other negative in the y-component.\n\nWait, but the problem says one photon is moving in upper-right, another in lower-right. So their angles are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively.\n\nSo the sum of their y-components must be zero. So 3 m c (sin(theta) - sin(phi)) = 0 \u2192 sin(theta) = sin(phi).\n\nBut if the two angles are such that theta = phi, but one is above and the other is below, then perhaps phi is equal to theta in the lower hemisphere. Wait, but sin(theta) = sin(phi) \u2192 either phi = theta or phi = 180 - theta. But in this case, the photons are moving in opposite y-directions, so perhaps phi = 180 - theta. Hmm, but that would make the photon in the lower-left direction, not lower-right. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two photons have angles theta and (180 - theta), but that's not correct because both are moving to the right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the photons making angles theta and (360 - theta), but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nWait, let's make it simpler. Let me denote the angles as theta and (theta'), where theta is above x-axis and theta' is below. So the sine of theta' would be negative if we take it as the angle from the x-axis. So perhaps theta' = -theta, but that's in the same sense as the angle.\n\nWait, but the momentum vectors must sum to the total momentum before, which is along x.\n\nSo perhaps the angles are such that their y-components cancel.\n\nLet me think: if the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, then their angles would be theta and (360 - theta), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the two photons are emitted at angles theta and (180 - theta) relative to the x-axis. But since both are moving to the right, that would mean that one is above the x-axis and the other is below, but their x-components would add constructively, and y-components would cancel.\n\nWait, maybe. Let me try that.\n\nSo, photon 1: angle theta above x-axis.\n\nPhoton 2: angle (180 - theta) below x-axis? Wait, no, because 180 - theta would point to the left. Hmm, that's not possible because the photons are moving to the right.\n\nWait, perhaps photon 2 is at angle (theta') below the x-axis, so sin(theta') is negative. Then, the y-components would be 3 m c sin(theta) and 3 m c sin(theta'), but sum to zero only if sin(theta) = - sin(theta'). Which would imply that theta' = -theta or theta' = 180 - theta. But photon 2 is moving to the right, so theta' must be between 0 and 180 degrees, but specifically in the lower hemisphere, so between 180 and 360? No, because that would be moving to the left. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps theta' is 360 - theta, but that's the same as -theta in terms of sine. So sin(theta') = sin(-theta) = - sin(theta). So in that case, if photon 2's angle is theta' = 360 - theta, then sin(theta') = - sin(theta). So their y-components would be 3 m c sin(theta) and 3 m c sin(360 - theta) = 3 m c (- sin(theta)). So the sum is zero.\n\nSo the y-components cancel. So that's good because the initial y-momentum is zero.\n\nNow, the x-components: p1x = 3 m c cos(theta), p2x = 3 m c cos(theta').\n\nBut theta' is 360 - theta, so cos(theta') = cos(360 - theta) = cos(theta).\n\nSo the total x-momentum after collision is 3 m c (cos(theta) + cos(theta)) = 6 m c cos(theta).\n\nBut the total x-momentum before collision is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c.\n\nSo:\n\n6 m c cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c.\n\nWe can cancel m c from both sides:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.\n\nLet me compute this numerically.\n\nsqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298\n\nsqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide that by 6: 2.14093 / 6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos(theta) \u2248 0.35682.\n\nWhat's the angle theta? Let me compute arccos(0.35682).\n\nUsing a calculator: arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees. Let me check: cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.3420. So 0.3568 is between 69 and 70. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, 69 degrees: cos(69) \u2248 0.3584.\n\n0.3568 is a bit less, so maybe 69.5 degrees? Let's see:\n\ncos(69 degrees) \u2248 0.3584.\n\ncos(69.5) \u2248 0.3555.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 0.3568, which is between 69 and 69.5. So perhaps approximately 69.2 degrees.\n\nWait, but the problem states that one photon is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So their angles from the x-axis are theta and -theta, but their x-components are both positive.\n\nWait, no. Photon 1 is at +theta, photon 2 is at -theta (but that would be in the fourth quadrant, i.e., lower-right). So their angles are theta and (360 - theta), but that's equivalent to -theta in terms of direction.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation gives theta \u224869 degrees. So the two photons are at 69 degrees above the x-axis and 69 degrees below. So the angle between them would be 69 + 69 = 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me think. The angle between the two photons would be theta (from x-axis) and (360 - theta), but the actual angle between them is 2 theta, because one is theta above and the other is theta below. So the angle between their directions is 2 theta.\n\nWait, no. Let me think in terms of vectors. Photon 1 is at angle theta above x-axis, and photon 2 is at angle (360 - theta) which is equivalent to -theta, which is theta below the x-axis. The angle between them is theta (upper) to theta (lower), which is 180 - 2 theta? Or perhaps 2 theta.\n\nWait, no, because the angle between a vector at theta and another at -theta is 2 theta. For example, if theta is 30 degrees, then the two vectors are at +30 and -30, so the angle between them is 60 degrees.\n\nSo in this case, theta is approximately 69 degrees, so the angle between them would be 2 * 69 = 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If photon 1 is at +69 degrees, photon 2 at -69 degrees, the angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees. Yes.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees. So that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps. Did I make any mistakes?\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Calculated energies before collision: 6 m c\u00b2. So each photon has 3 m c\u00b2.\n\n2. Each photon's momentum is 3 m c.\n\n3. Set up momentum conservation in y-direction: sin(theta) = sin(phi). Concluded that one is theta, the other is -theta. So their y-components cancel.\n\n4. In x-direction: sum of x-components equals initial x-momentum.\n\n5. Solved for cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] /6 \u2248 0.3568.\n\n6. Theta \u224869 degrees, so angle between photons is 138 degrees.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be C) 138.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Oh right, when matter and antimatter particles annihilate, they produce gamma photons usually. \n\nSo, the setup is: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured\u2014one is upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.\n\nWait, Lorentz factors are gamma, right? So gamma for electron is 4, and for positron it's 2. I remember that the Lorentz factor relates to the time dilation and length contraction in relativity. But here, since they're moving towards each other, I need to consider their energies and momenta.\n\nElectrons and positrons have the same mass, right? So mass m is the same for both. The positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, so same mass but opposite charge.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total energy and momentum before the collision. Because in relativity, the conservation of energy and momentum must hold.\n\nSo for the electron: gamma is 4. Its energy is gamma * m * c\u00b2. Similarly, the positron's energy is gamma * m * c\u00b2, which is 2 * m * c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but since the positron is moving to the left (from the right), maybe I should assign directions. Let me think: the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nSo their momenta would be in opposite directions as well. Let me set up a coordinate system where the electron is moving in the positive x-direction, and the positron in the negative x-direction.\n\nThe momentum p is gamma * m * v. But velocity is a vector. So for the electron, p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e in +x. For the positron, p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p in -x direction. Wait, but v is in opposite direction, so p_p would be negative.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the magnitudes and then assign directions. So for the electron, |p_e| = gamma_e * m * v_e. Similarly for the positron, |p_p| = gamma_p * m * v_p. But since they're moving towards each other, the directions are opposite.\n\nWait, but since they're annihilating, their combined energy and momentum must equal the photons' energy and momentum. Because energy and momentum are conserved.\n\nSo let's compute the total energy and momentum before collision.\n\nElectron's energy: E_e = gamma_e * m c\u00b2 = 4 m c\u00b2.\n\nPositron's energy: E_p = gamma_p * m c\u00b2 = 2 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo total energy E_total = 4 m c\u00b2 + 2 m c\u00b2 = 6 m c\u00b2.\n\nNow, momentum. For the electron, p_e = gamma_e * m v_e. Let's find v_e in terms of c. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So gamma_e is 4, so 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let's square both sides: 16 = 1/(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/16 \u2192 v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 15/16 \u2192 v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(\u221a15)/4 \u2248 0.968 c.\n\nSimilarly for the positron, gamma_p is 2. So 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 4 = 1/(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/4 \u2192 v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 3/4 \u2192 v_p = (sqrt(3)/2) c \u2248 0.866 c.\n\nSo the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m v_e = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m c sqrt(15). Because 4 cancels with 4. So sqrt(15) is about 3.872, so p_e is around 3.872 m c.\n\nPositron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m v_p. But since the positron is moving to the left (negative x), p_p is negative. So p_p = 2 * m * (sqrt(3)/2) c = m c sqrt(3). But direction is negative x, so p_p = - m c sqrt(3).\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify the directions. The electron is moving from left to right (positive x), so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving from right to left (negative x), so its momentum is negative. So yes, p_p is negative.\n\nSo total momentum p_total = p_e + p_p = (m c sqrt(15)) + ( - m c sqrt(3) ) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nHmm, let me compute that numerically to get an idea. sqrt(15) is approx 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So 3.872 - 1.732 \u2248 2.14. So p_total \u2248 2.14 m c.\n\nWait, but I think I should keep it symbolic for now. So p_total = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, after the collision, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon. Given that both photons have the same energy, E1 = E2 = E_photon.\n\nPhotons carry momentum, which is E/c, and their momentum direction is the same as their direction of travel. Also, for photons, the magnitude of momentum is E/c.\n\nSo the total energy after collision is 2 E_photon, which must equal the total energy before collision, which is 6 m c\u00b2. So 2 E_photon = 6 m c\u00b2 \u2192 E_photon = 3 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo each photon has energy 3 m c\u00b2. That's a lot of energy for a photon, but okay.\n\nNow, the momentum of each photon is E_photon / c = 3 m c\u00b2 / c = 3 m c. So each photon has a momentum of 3 m c. But their directions are one upper-right and one lower-right. So their momenta have both x and y components.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Photon 1 is moving in the upper-right direction, so its momentum has positive x and positive y components. Photon 2 is moving in the lower-right direction, so positive x and negative y components.\n\nSo for photon 1: p1x = 3 m c cos(theta), p1y = 3 m c sin(theta).\n\nPhoton 2: p2x = 3 m c cos(phi), p2y = -3 m c sin(phi).\n\nWait, but the problem states that both photons are moving in the right direction, but one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their x-components are positive. The angles would be measured from the x-axis. So theta and phi are angles above and below the x-axis, respectively.\n\nNow, the total momentum after collision must equal the total momentum before collision.\n\nTotal x-momentum after: p1x + p2x = 3 m c (cos(theta) + cos(phi)).\n\nTotal y-momentum after: p1y + p2y = 3 m c (sin(theta) - sin(phi)).\n\nBut the total momentum before collision is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c in the x-direction. There's no y-momentum before, because both particles were moving along the x-axis. So the y-momentum after must be zero.\n\nSo, the y-momentum equation:\n\n3 m c (sin(theta) - sin(phi)) = 0 \u2192 sin(theta) = sin(phi).\n\nHmm, sin(theta) equals sin(phi). So theta could equal phi, or theta = 180 - phi, but considering their directions, which are upper-right and lower-right, theta is positive and phi is positive, but perhaps one is theta and the other is (180 - theta) in the lower hemisphere. Wait, no, because both are in the right direction.\n\nWait, for a photon moving in lower-right, phi is measured from the x-axis downward. So if phi is the angle below the x-axis, then sin(phi) is negative. Wait, but in the setup, I considered p2y as negative because it's downward. So when I wrote p2y = -3 m c sin(phi), I think phi is the angle from the x-axis downward. So sin(phi) is positive if phi is measured downward.\n\nWait, perhaps I should denote the angles more precisely. Let's say photon 1 makes an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle theta below the x-axis. So phi = theta. But then sin(theta) = sin(phi), but for one, it's positive and the other negative. Wait, no, because in that case, the y-components would be p1y = 3 m c sin(theta) and p2y = -3 m c sin(theta). Then, p1y + p2y = 0, which satisfies the y-momentum conservation.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So perhaps the two photons have symmetric angles above and below the x-axis. So their y-components cancel each other out.\n\nSo if that's the case, then the angles theta and phi are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So theta = phi in terms of their magnitudes, but one is positive and the other negative in the y-component.\n\nWait, but the problem says one photon is moving in upper-right, another in lower-right. So their angles are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively.\n\nSo the sum of their y-components must be zero. So 3 m c (sin(theta) - sin(phi)) = 0 \u2192 sin(theta) = sin(phi).\n\nBut if the two angles are such that theta = phi, but one is above and the other is below, then perhaps phi is equal to theta in the lower hemisphere. Wait, but sin(theta) = sin(phi) \u2192 either phi = theta or phi = 180 - theta. But in this case, the photons are moving in opposite y-directions, so perhaps phi = 180 - theta. Hmm, but that would make the photon in the lower-left direction, not lower-right. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two photons have angles theta and (180 - theta), but that's not correct because both are moving to the right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the photons making angles theta and (360 - theta), but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nWait, let's make it simpler. Let me denote the angles as theta and (theta'), where theta is above x-axis and theta' is below. So the sine of theta' would be negative if we take it as the angle from the x-axis. So perhaps theta' = -theta, but that's in the same sense as the angle.\n\nWait, but the momentum vectors must sum to the total momentum before, which is along x.\n\nSo perhaps the angles are such that their y-components cancel.\n\nLet me think: if the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, then their angles would be theta and (360 - theta), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the two photons are emitted at angles theta and (180 - theta) relative to the x-axis. But since both are moving to the right, that would mean that one is above the x-axis and the other is below, but their x-components would add constructively, and y-components would cancel.\n\nWait, maybe. Let me try that.\n\nSo, photon 1: angle theta above x-axis.\n\nPhoton 2: angle (180 - theta) below x-axis? Wait, no, because 180 - theta would point to the left. Hmm, that's not possible because the photons are moving to the right.\n\nWait, perhaps photon 2 is at angle (theta') below the x-axis, so sin(theta') is negative. Then, the y-components would be 3 m c sin(theta) and 3 m c sin(theta'), but sum to zero only if sin(theta) = - sin(theta'). Which would imply that theta' = -theta or theta' = 180 - theta. But photon 2 is moving to the right, so theta' must be between 0 and 180 degrees, but specifically in the lower hemisphere, so between 180 and 360? No, because that would be moving to the left. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps theta' is 360 - theta, but that's the same as -theta in terms of sine. So sin(theta') = sin(-theta) = - sin(theta). So in that case, if photon 2's angle is theta' = 360 - theta, then sin(theta') = - sin(theta). So their y-components would be 3 m c sin(theta) and 3 m c sin(360 - theta) = 3 m c (- sin(theta)). So the sum is zero.\n\nSo the y-components cancel. So that's good because the initial y-momentum is zero.\n\nNow, the x-components: p1x = 3 m c cos(theta), p2x = 3 m c cos(theta').\n\nBut theta' is 360 - theta, so cos(theta') = cos(360 - theta) = cos(theta).\n\nSo the total x-momentum after collision is 3 m c (cos(theta) + cos(theta)) = 6 m c cos(theta).\n\nBut the total x-momentum before collision is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c.\n\nSo:\n\n6 m c cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c.\n\nWe can cancel m c from both sides:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.\n\nLet me compute this numerically.\n\nsqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298\n\nsqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide that by 6: 2.14093 / 6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos(theta) \u2248 0.35682.\n\nWhat's the angle theta? Let me compute arccos(0.35682).\n\nUsing a calculator: arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees. Let me check: cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.3420. So 0.3568 is between 69 and 70. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, 69 degrees: cos(69) \u2248 0.3584.\n\n0.3568 is a bit less, so maybe 69.5 degrees? Let's see:\n\ncos(69 degrees) \u2248 0.3584.\n\ncos(69.5) \u2248 0.3555.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 0.3568, which is between 69 and 69.5. So perhaps approximately 69.2 degrees.\n\nWait, but the problem states that one photon is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So their angles from the x-axis are theta and -theta, but their x-components are both positive.\n\nWait, no. Photon 1 is at +theta, photon 2 is at -theta (but that would be in the fourth quadrant, i.e., lower-right). So their angles are theta and (360 - theta), but that's equivalent to -theta in terms of direction.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation gives theta \u224869 degrees. So the two photons are at 69 degrees above the x-axis and 69 degrees below. So the angle between them would be 69 + 69 = 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me think. The angle between the two photons would be theta (from x-axis) and (360 - theta), but the actual angle between them is 2 theta, because one is theta above and the other is theta below. So the angle between their directions is 2 theta.\n\nWait, no. Let me think in terms of vectors. Photon 1 is at angle theta above x-axis, and photon 2 is at angle (360 - theta) which is equivalent to -theta, which is theta below the x-axis. The angle between them is theta (upper) to theta (lower), which is 180 - 2 theta? Or perhaps 2 theta.\n\nWait, no, because the angle between a vector at theta and another at -theta is 2 theta. For example, if theta is 30 degrees, then the two vectors are at +30 and -30, so the angle between them is 60 degrees.\n\nSo in this case, theta is approximately 69 degrees, so the angle between them would be 2 * 69 = 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If photon 1 is at +69 degrees, photon 2 at -69 degrees, the angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees. Yes.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees. So that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps. Did I make any mistakes?\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Calculated energies before collision: 6 m c\u00b2. So each photon has 3 m c\u00b2.\n\n2. Each photon's momentum is 3 m c.\n\n3. Set up momentum conservation in y-direction: sin(theta) = sin(phi). Concluded that one is theta, the other is -theta.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again and see what it's about.\n\nSo, the question involves an electron and a positron moving towards each other along a horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.\n\nHmm, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they typically produce photons. Since an electron and a positron are involved, their rest mass energy would contribute to the photons' energy. But wait, the problem says the photons have the same energy. So each photon must carry half of the total energy from the annihilation.\n\nBut wait, considering the Lorentz factors, their energies before collision might not just be their rest mass. The Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time, length, and mass dilate. So each particle's energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. Oh wait, but the rest mass energy for an electron and positron is the same, right? Because they have the same mass.\n\nSo the electron has gamma_e = 4, and the positron has gamma_p = 2. Their rest mass energy is m c squared, let's say mc\u00b2 is about 0.511 MeV, but the exact value might not matter here since we're dealing with ratios.\n\nSo the total energy before collision would be the sum of their energies. So energy_e = gamma_e * mc\u00b2 = 4 mc\u00b2, energy_p = gamma_p * mc\u00b2 = 2 mc\u00b2. So total energy is 4 + 2 = 6 mc\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, they produce two photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy. So each photon's energy would be 3 mc\u00b2 each? Because 6 divided by 2 is 3.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when you have two particles annihilating, the energy is converted into the photons. But wait, the initial particles have kinetic energy and rest mass energy. So the total energy of the system before collision is the sum of their relativistic energies.\n\nWait, but the rest mass energy for each is mc\u00b2, so the positron has energy 2 mc\u00b2 (gamma=2), and the electron has 4 mc\u00b2 (gamma=4). So total energy is 6 mc\u00b2.\n\nThe photons each have 3 mc\u00b2, so each photon's energy is 3 mc\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, photons have energy E = h f and momentum p = E / c. So each photon's momentum is (3 mc\u00b2) / c = 3 m c. So the magnitude is 3 m c for each photon.\n\nBut the directions are important. One photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So their momenta vectors are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis. Let me imagine this: one photon is going to the upper right, making some angle theta with the horizontal, the other is going to the lower right, making the same angle theta below the horizontal.\n\nWait, but since the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right, perhaps they are symmetric above and below the horizontal axis. So their momenta vectors would have the same magnitude but opposite angles, like +theta and -theta relative to the horizontal.\n\nBut wait, in terms of direction, the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right. Hmm, that's interesting. So the electron was moving left, and the positron right. So their collision is head-on. So after annihilation, the two photons go in directions that are both to the right but one up and one down.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. Because the initial momenta of the electron and positron are opposite. So maybe the system's total momentum before collision is not zero.\n\nWait, right, because the electron is moving left with some momentum, and the positron moving right with some other momentum. So the total momentum before collision is the sum of their momenta.\n\nI should calculate the total momentum before annihilation to understand the system's momentum. Because in the annihilation, the total momentum must be conserved, so the photons' momenta must add up to the same total as before.\n\nSo let's think in terms of momentum conservation.\n\nLet me denote the horizontal axis as the x-axis. The electron is moving along the x-axis from left to right (since the problem says it's moving from the left, so direction is right along x). Wait, no, the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so it's moving towards the right. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so it's moving towards the left.\n\nWait, wait, let me clarify. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left. So its velocity is to the right (positive x direction). The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, which would be to the left (negative x direction). So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nBut in terms of momentum, I need to compute each particle's momentum.\n\nThe momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = gamma m v. But since v is a vector, the directions matter.\n\nSo, electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e m v_e (in the positive x direction).\n\nPositron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m v_p (but since it's moving to the left, v_p is negative). So p_p is gamma_p m v_p, but v_p is negative.\n\nWait, but wait, in terms of magnitude, the positron's momentum is gamma_p m v, but since it's moving to the left, the momentum is negative.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to take the direction into account with signs. Let me define positive x as the right direction.\n\nSo the electron is moving to the right (positive x), so its velocity is positive. The positron is moving to the left (negative x), so its velocity is negative.\n\nSo the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.\n\nThe momentum of the positron is p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p.\n\nBut since the positron is moving to the left, v_p is negative. So p_p is negative.\n\nWait, but wait, the positron has the same mass as the electron. So m_e = m_p = m.\n\nSo let me compute each momentum's magnitude.\n\nBut wait, the velocity can be expressed in terms of the Lorentz factor. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), and v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nBut maybe it's easier to express momentum in terms of gamma and velocity. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the momentum using the relation p = gamma m v. Alternatively, since p = gamma m v, and gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the momentum as p = gamma m v, and express v in terms of beta, where beta = v/c.\n\nSo for each particle, gamma = 4 for the electron, gamma_p = 2 for the positron.\n\nSo for the electron, beta_e = v_e / c. Similarly, beta_p = v_p / c.\n\nSo the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e m beta_e c.\n\nSimilarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m beta_p c, but since it's moving to the left, p_p is negative.\n\nWait, but we need to find beta in terms of gamma. Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).\n\nSo for the electron, gamma_e =4, so beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682 c.\n\nSo p_e = gamma_e m beta_e c = 4 m * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m sqrt(15) c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p =2, so beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866 c.\n\nBut since the positron is moving to the left, its beta is negative. So beta_p = - sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo p_p = gamma_p m beta_p c = 2 m * (-sqrt(3)/2) c = - m sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p.\n\np_total = m sqrt(15) c - m sqrt(3) c.\n\nFactor out m c: m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nBut what is sqrt(15) minus sqrt(3)? Let me compute approximate values. sqrt(3) is about 1.732, sqrt(15) is about 3.872. So 3.872 - 1.732 = 2.140. So p_total \u2248 m c * 2.140.\n\nWait, but wait, this is in the positive x direction, because the electron's momentum is larger.\n\nNow, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Both have the same energy. Let me denote their momenta as vectors.\n\nEach photon's energy is E_photon = 3 mc\u00b2, as each photon has half the total energy (since total energy before was 6 mc\u00b2, and each photon gets 3).\n\nWait, wait, earlier I thought each photon has 3 mc\u00b2. Let me confirm.\n\nTotal energy before annihilation: sum of the energies of electron and positron. Each has energy gamma mc\u00b2. So electron's energy is 4 mc\u00b2, positron's is 2 mc\u00b2. Total is 6 mc\u00b2. Since photons carry away all the energy, each photon has 3 mc\u00b2.\n\nSo each photon's energy is E = 3 mc\u00b2. Since E = pc for a photon, the momentum magnitude is p_photon = E / c = 3 mc\u00b2 / c = 3 m c.\n\nSo each photon has momentum 3 m c, but in different directions.\n\nThe problem states that one photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So both have x components in the positive direction, but their y components are opposite.\n\nLet me denote the first photon as photon 1, moving in the upper-right direction, making an angle theta above the x-axis. The second photon, photon 2, moves in the lower-right, making the same angle theta below the x-axis.\n\nSo the momentum vectors for the photons are:\n\nPhoton 1: p1 = (3 m c cos(theta), 3 m c sin(theta)).\n\nPhoton 2: p2 = (3 m c cos(theta), -3 m c sin(theta)).\n\nWait, but wait, if both are moving to the right, their x-components are positive. So yes, their x-components are 3 m c cos(theta), but their y-components are positive and negative.\n\nThe total momentum after annihilation is p_total' = p1 + p2.\n\nSo let's compute p_total' = (3 m c cos(theta) + 3 m c cos(theta), 3 m c sin(theta) - 3 m c sin(theta)).\n\nWait, that would be (6 m c cos(theta), 0).\n\nBut before annihilation, the total momentum was p_total = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction.\n\nSo for momentum conservation, p_total' must equal p_total.\n\nSo 6 m c cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWe can cancel m c from both sides:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nCompute sqrt(15) \u2248 3.872, sqrt(3) \u2248 1.732.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 2.140.\n\nSo 6 cos(theta) = 2.140 \u2192 cos(theta) = 2.140 / 6 \u2248 0.3567.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.3567) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, wait, because cos(theta) is positive, so theta is in the first quadrant. But that's the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. The question is asking for the angle between the two photons. Since one is at +theta and the other at -theta, the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nSo 2 * 69 \u2248 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCompute sqrt(15) = approximately 3.872983.\n\nsqrt(3) = approximately 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 3.872983 - 1.73205 = 2.140933.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.140933 / 6 \u2248 0.356822.\n\nSo arccos(0.356822) is approximately 69 degrees, as I said.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 2*69 = 138 degrees. So the correct answer is C) 138.\n",

The problem states that both photons have the same energy. So each photon's energy would be 3 mc\u00b2 each? Because 6 divided by 2 is 3.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when you have two particles annihilating, the energy is converted into the photons. But wait, the initial particles have kinetic energy and rest mass energy. So the total energy of the system before collision is the sum of their relativistic energies.\n\nWait, but the rest mass energy for each is mc\u00b2, so the positron has energy 2 mc\u00b2 (gamma=2), and the electron has 4 mc\u00b2 (gamma=4). So total energy is 6 mc\u00b2.\n\nThe photons each have 3 mc\u00b2, so each photon's energy is 3 mc\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, photons have energy E = h f and momentum p = E / c.

Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), and v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nBut maybe it's easier to express momentum in terms of gamma and velocity. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the momentum using the relation p = gamma m v. Alternatively, since p = gamma m v, and gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the momentum as p = gamma m v, and express v in terms of beta, where beta = v/c.\n\nSo for each particle, gamma = 4 for the electron, gamma_p = 2 for the positron.\n\nSo for the electron, beta_e = v_e / c. Similarly, beta_p = v_p / c.\n\nSo the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e m beta_e c.\n\nSimilarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m beta_p c, but since it's moving to the left, p_p is negative.\n\nWait, but we need to find beta in terms of gamma. Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).\n\nSo for the electron, gamma_e =4, so beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682 c.\n\nSo p_e = gamma_e m beta_e c = 4 m * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m sqrt(15) c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p =2, so beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866 c.\n\nBut since the positron is moving to the left, its beta is negative. So beta_p = - sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo p_p = gamma_p m beta_p c = 2 m * (-sqrt(3)/2) c = - m sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p.\n\np_total = m sqrt(15) c - m sqrt(3) c.\n\nFactor out m c: m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nBut what is sqrt(15) minus sqrt(3)? Let me compute approximate values. sqrt(3) is about 1.732, sqrt(15) is about 3.872. So 3.872 - 1.732 = 2.140. So p_total \u2248 m c * 2.140.\n\nWait, but wait, this is in the positive x direction, because the electron's momentum is larger.\n\nNow, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Both have the same energy. Let me denote their momenta as vectors.\n\nEach photon's energy is E_photon = 3 mc\u00b2, as each photon has half the total energy (since total energy before was 6 mc\u00b2, and each photon gets 3).\n\nWait, wait, earlier I thought each photon has 3 mc\u00b2. Let me confirm.\n\nTotal energy before annihilation: sum of the energies of electron and positron. Each has energy gamma mc\u00b2. So electron's energy is 4 mc\u00b2, positron's is 2 mc\u00b2. Total is 6 mc\u00b2. Since photons carry away all the energy, each photon has 3 mc\u00b2.\n\nSo each photon's energy is E = 3 mc\u00b2. Since E = pc for a photon, the momentum magnitude is p_photon = E / c = 3 mc\u00b2 / c = 3 m c.\n\nSo each photon has momentum 3 m c, but in different directions.\n\nThe problem states that one photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So both have x components in the positive direction, but their y components are opposite.\n\nLet me denote the first photon as photon 1, moving in the upper-right direction, making an angle theta above the x-axis. The second photon, photon 2, moves in the lower-right, making the same angle theta below the x-axis.\n\nSo the momentum vectors for the photons are:\n\nPhoton 1: p1 = (3 m c cos(theta), 3 m c sin(theta)).\n\nPhoton 2: p2 = (3 m c cos(theta), -3 m c sin(theta)).\n\nWait, but wait, if both are moving to the right, their x-components are positive. So yes, their x-components are 3 m c cos(theta), but their y-components are positive and negative.\n\nThe total momentum after annihilation is p_total' = p1 + p2.\n\nSo let's compute p_total' = (3 m c cos(theta) + 3 m c cos(theta), 3 m c sin(theta) - 3 m c sin(theta)).\n\nWait, that would be (6 m c cos(theta), 0).\n\nBut before annihilation, the total momentum was p_total = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction.\n\nSo for momentum conservation, p_total' must equal p_total.\n\nSo 6 m c cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWe can cancel m c from both sides:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nCompute sqrt(15) \u2248 3.872, sqrt(3) \u2248 1.732.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 2.140.\n\nSo 6 cos(theta) = 2.140 \u2192 cos(theta) = 2.140 / 6 \u2248 0.3567.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.3567) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, wait, because cos(theta) is positive, so theta is in the first quadrant. But that's the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. The question is asking for the angle between the two photons. Since one is at +theta and the other at -theta, the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nSo 2 * 69 \u2248 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCompute sqrt(15) = approximately 3.872983.\n\nsqrt(3) = approximately 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 3.872983 - 1.73205 = 2.140933.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.140933 / 6 \u2248 0.356822.\n\nSo arccos(0.356822) is approximately 69 degrees, as I said.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 2*69 = 138 degrees. So the correct answer is C) 138.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, followed by the production of two photons with equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma_e = 4 \\).\n   - The positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma_p = 2 \\).\n   - Both particles annihilate, producing two photons with equal energy.\n\n2. **Energy Conservation**:\n   - The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron:\n     \\[\n     E_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e m c^2 + \\gamma_p m c^2 = 4 m c^2 + 2 m c^2 = 6 m c^2.\n     \\]\n   - After annihilation, the total energy is shared equally between the two photons:\n     \\[\n     E_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m c^2.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Momentum Conservation**:\n   - The total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Using \\( p = \\gamma m v \\) and \\( v = \\beta c \\), where \\( \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} \\):\n     - For the electron (\\( \\gamma_e = 4 \\)):\n       \\[\n       \\beta_e = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}, \\quad p_e = \\gamma_e m \\beta_e c = 4 m \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c = m \\sqrt{15} c.\n       \\]\n     - For the positron (\\( \\gamma_p = 2 \\)):\n       \\[\n       \\beta_p = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\quad p_p = \\gamma_p m \\beta_p c = 2 m \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c = m \\sqrt{3} c.\n       \\]\n     - Since the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative:\n       \\[\n       p_{\\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = m \\sqrt{15} c - m \\sqrt{3} c = m c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n       \\]\n\n   - After annihilation, the photons must conserve momentum. Let the photons have equal energy \\( E_{\\text{photon}} = 3 m c^2 \\) and momentum magnitudes \\( p_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m c \\). The photons move in directions symmetric about the x-axis, making angles \\( \\theta \\) above and below the x-axis.\n\n4. **Photon Momentum Components**:\n   - Photon 1 (upper-right): \\( p_1 = (3 m c \\cos\\theta, 3 m c \\sin\\theta) \\).\n   - Photon 2 (lower-right): \\( p_2 = (3 m c \\cos\\theta, -3 m c \\sin\\theta) \\).\n   - Total momentum after annihilation:\n     \\[\n     p_{\\text{total}}' = p_1 + p_2 = (6 m c \\cos\\theta, 0).\n     \\]\n\n5. **Equating Total Momentum**:\n   - Before annihilation, the total momentum is \\( p_{\\text{total}} = m c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\) (in the x-direction).\n   - After annihilation, the total momentum is \\( p_{\\text{total}}' = 6 m c \\cos\\theta \\).\n   - Equating the two:\n     \\[\n     6 m c \\cos\\theta = m c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n     \\]\n   - Cancel \\( m c \\) from both sides:\n     \\[\n     6 \\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}.\n     \\]\n\n6. **Solving for \\( \\theta \\)**:\n   - Compute \\( \\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.872 \\) and \\( \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.872 - 1.732 = 2.140.\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( \\cos\\theta \\):\n     \\[\n     \\cos\\theta = \\frac{2.140}{6} \\approx 0.3567.\n     \\]\n   - Find \\( \\theta \\):\n     \\[\n     \\theta = \\arccos(0.3567) \\approx 69^\\circ.\n     \\]\n\n7. **Angle Between Photons**:\n   - Since one photon is at \\( +\\theta \\) and the other at \\( -\\theta \\), the angle between them is:\n     \\[\n     2\\theta = 2 \\times 69^\\circ = 138^\\circ.\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.\n\nAnswer: C",
