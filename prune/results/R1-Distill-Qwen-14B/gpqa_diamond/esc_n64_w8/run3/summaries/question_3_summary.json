      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of expectation values and operators. Let me take it step by step.\n\nThe question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition of its spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. I remember that |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are the eigenstates of the sigma_z operator. The problem is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. Hmm, okay, expectation values can be tricky, but I think I remember that for expectation values, you can break the operator into parts and compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, I should probably write down what the expectation value formula looks like. The expectation value of an operator A is \u27e8\u03c8| A |\u03c8\u27e9. So in this case, A is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. That means the expectation value would be 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nWait, right, because expectation values are linear. So I can compute each term separately and add them up.\n\nSo I need to find \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 for the given state.\n\nLet me recall what \u03c3z and \u03c3x do. \u03c3z is the Pauli z matrix, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 respectively. Similarly, \u03c3x is the Pauli x matrix, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1 when acting on the eigenstates of \u03c3x. But wait, the given state is in the \u03c3z basis, not the \u03c3x basis. So I can't directly say that |\u2191\u27e9 is an eigenstate of \u03c3x. Oh, right, I'll have to calculate \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 using the state.\n\nLet me write the state \u03c8 as a column vector to make calculations easier. Since |\u2191\u27e9 is (1,0) and |\u2193\u27e9 is (0,1), the state \u03c8 is 0.5*(1,0) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0,1). So \u03c8 is a vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nWait, wait, I should double-check the normalization. Let me compute the magnitude squared. (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So yeah, it's normalized. Good, no need to worry about that.\n\nNow, \u03c3z is the matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when I compute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9, it's \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z \u03c8. Let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is just the probability of being in |\u2191\u27e9 multiplied by +1 plus the probability of being in |\u2193\u27e9 multiplied by -1. Because the state is a linear combination, the coefficients squared give the probabilities.\n\nWait, that's a much easier way. So the coefficient of |\u2191\u27e9 is 0.5, so probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient of |\u2193\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2, so probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, moving on to \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nHmm, \u03c3x is the Pauli x matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. To find \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, I need to compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nLet me write \u03c8 as a column vector: [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nMultiply \u03c3x with \u03c8: \u03c3x * \u03c8 would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Because \u03c3x swaps the components. So the first component becomes the second, and the second becomes the first. So yes, [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by \u03c3x gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. Actually, \u03c3x is applied to \u03c8, so it's the matrix multiplied by the vector. Let me compute it:\n\n\u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I multiply \u03c3x by \u03c8, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], the result is [ sqrt(3)/2; 0.5 ].\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 (which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]) multiplied by this result gives (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).\n\nLet me compute that: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4. And the second term is the same, because (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 is also sqrt(3)/4. So adding them together gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, but wait a second, that's the expectation value of \u03c3x, so \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2. Let me make sure I did this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the formula \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nSo \u03c8 is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). \u03c3x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So \u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Then the inner product with \u03c8 is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = same as before, sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo now, putting it all together. The operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\n10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\n5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5 * 1.73205)/2 \u2248 (8.66025)/2 \u2248 4.330125.\n\nSo adding them: -5 + 4.330125 = -0.669875.\n\nWait, wait, that's about -0.67, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, the options are A) -1.4, B)1.65, C)-0.7, D)0.85.\n\nHmm, -0.67 is close to -0.7. So option C is -0.7.\n\nWait, but let me be precise. Let me compute sqrt(3)/2 accurately.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205. So 1.73205 / 2 is about 0.866025.\n\nSo 5 * 0.866025 = 4.330125.\n\n10 * (-0.5) is -5.\n\nSo -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.\n\nSo approximately -0.67. Rounding to one decimal place would be -0.7.\n\nSo the answer is C) -0.7.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistake in the steps?\n\nWait, another approach: the state \u03c8 is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). So the expectation value for \u03c3z is |\u2191> coefficient squared times 1 plus |\u2193> coefficient squared times (-1). That's 0.25 *1 + 0.75*(-1) = -0.5.\n\nFor \u03c3x, since it's the expectation of \u03c3x, which is the same as the expectation of (|\u2192\u27e9\u27e8\u2190| + |\u2190\u27e9\u27e8\u2192|) ), but perhaps another way to compute it is using the formula \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = (|a|^2 + |b|^2) where a and b are the components in some basis, but no, I think my previous method is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it using the formula for spin-x expectation value, which is 2*(probability of +x state) -1, but wait, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, another way to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9: since \u03c3x is Hermitian and has eigenstates. But perhaps it's easier to think of it in terms of the components. So for a general state, the expectation value of \u03c3x is (\u03c8_x^* \u03c8_x + \u03c8_y^* \u03c8_y), but no, that might not be right. Alternatively, I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nWait, another approach: since the state is \u03c8 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, then \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 2*(a b* + a* b) ). Because \u03c3x can be written in terms of the spin matrices, and for spin-1/2 particles, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2*(a b* + a* b) ). Let me see.\n\nWait, a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So a b* is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) since b is real. So a b* = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. Same with a* b because they're real. So 2*(sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 )= 2*(sqrt(3)/2) )= sqrt(3).\n\nWait, that's different from what I got before. Oh no, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, what's the correct formula for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 in terms of a and b?\n\nLet me think. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you compute \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9, it's (a*, b*) * \u03c3x * (a, b)^T.\n\nSo let me compute it step by step. Let me write \u03c8 as (a, b) = (0.5, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo \u03c3x * \u03c8 is (b, a) = (sqrt(3)/2, 0.5).\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c3x | \u03c8\u27e9 is a*b + b*a = a b + b a = 2 a b.\n\nWait, because a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * (sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAh, that's the same result as before. So I didn't make a mistake earlier. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866.\n\nSo putting it back into the expectation value of the operator:\n\n10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = (-5) +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWhich is approximately -0.7, so the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, let me compute more precisely.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.7320508075688772.\n\nSo sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660254037844386.\n\n5 * 0.8660254037844386 = 4.330127018922193.\n\n10*(-0.5)= -5.\n\nAdding them: -5 +4.330127018922193= -0.669872981077807.\n\nRounded to one decimal place: -0.7.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is C) -0.7.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of expectation values and operators. Let me take it step by step.\n\nThe question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition of its spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. I remember that |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are the eigenstates of the sigma_z operator.

That means the expectation value would be 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nWait, right, because expectation values are linear. So I can compute each term separately and add them up.\n\nSo I need to find \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 for the given state.\n\nLet me recall what \u03c3z and \u03c3x do. \u03c3z is the Pauli z matrix, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 respectively. Similarly, \u03c3x is the Pauli x matrix, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1 when acting on the eigenstates of \u03c3x. But wait, the given state is in the \u03c3z basis, not the \u03c3x basis. So I can't directly say that |\u2191\u27e9 is an eigenstate of \u03c3x. Oh, right, I'll have to calculate \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 using the state.\n\nLet me write the state \u03c8 as a column vector to make calculations easier. Since |\u2191\u27e9 is (1,0) and |\u2193\u27e9 is (0,1), the state \u03c8 is 0.5*(1,0) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0,1). So \u03c8 is a vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nWait, wait, I should double-check the normalization. Let me compute the magnitude squared. (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So yeah, it's normalized. Good, no need to worry about that.\n\nNow, \u03c3z is the matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when I compute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9, it's \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3z \u03c8. Let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is just the probability of being in |\u2191\u27e9 multiplied by +1 plus the probability of being in |\u2193\u27e9 multiplied by -1. Because the state is a linear combination, the coefficients squared give the probabilities.\n\nWait, that's a much easier way. So the coefficient of |\u2191\u27e9 is 0.5, so probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient of |\u2193\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2, so probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, moving on to \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nHmm, \u03c3x is the Pauli x matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. To find \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, I need to compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nLet me write \u03c8 as a column vector: [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nMultiply \u03c3x with \u03c8: \u03c3x * \u03c8 would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Because \u03c3x swaps the components. So the first component becomes the second, and the second becomes the first. So yes, [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by \u03c3x gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. Actually, \u03c3x is applied to \u03c8, so it's the matrix multiplied by the vector. Let me compute it:\n\n\u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I multiply \u03c3x by \u03c8, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], the result is [ sqrt(3)/2; 0.5 ].\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 (which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]) multiplied by this result gives (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).\n\nLet me compute that: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4. And the second term is the same, because (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 is also sqrt(3)/4. So adding them together gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, but wait a second, that's the expectation value of \u03c3x, so \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2. Let me make sure I did this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the formula \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nSo \u03c8 is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). \u03c3x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So \u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Then the inner product with \u03c8 is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = same as before, sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo now, putting it all together. The operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\n10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\n5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5 * 1.73205)/2 \u2248 (8.66025)/2 \u2248 4.330125.\n\nSo adding them: -5 + 4.330125 = -0.669875.\n\nWait, wait, that's about -0.67, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, the options are A) -1.4, B)1.65, C)-0.7, D)0.85.\n\nHmm, -0.67 is close to -0.7. So option C is -0.7.\n\nWait, but let me be precise. Let me compute sqrt(3)/2 accurately.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205. So 1.73205 / 2 is about 0.866025.\n\nSo 5 * 0.866025 = 4.330125.\n\n10 * (-0.5) is -5.\n\nSo -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.\n\nSo approximately -0.67. Rounding to one decimal place would be -0.7.\n\nSo the answer is C) -0.7.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistake in the steps?\n\nWait, another approach: the state \u03c8 is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). So the expectation value for \u03c3z is |\u2191> coefficient squared times 1 plus |\u2193> coefficient squared times (-1). That's 0.25 *1 + 0.75*(-1) = -0.5.\n\nFor \u03c3x, since it's the expectation of \u03c3x, which is the same as the expectation of (|\u2192\u27e9\u27e8\u2190| + |\u2190\u27e9\u27e8\u2192|) ), but perhaps another way to compute it is using the formula \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = (|a|^2 + |b|^2) where a and b are the components in some basis, but no, I think my previous method is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it using the formula for spin-x expectation value, which is 2*(probability of +x state) -1, but wait, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, another way to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9: since \u03c3x is Hermitian and has eigenstates. But perhaps it's easier to think of it in terms of the components. So for a general state, the expectation value of \u03c3x is (\u03c8_x^* \u03c8_x + \u03c8_y^* \u03c8_y), but no, that might not be right. Alternatively, I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nWait, another approach: since the state is \u03c8 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, then \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 2*(a b* + a* b) ). Because \u03c3x can be written in terms of the spin matrices, and for spin-1/2 particles, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2*(a b* + a* b) ). Let me see.\n\nWait, a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So a b* is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) since b is real. So a b* = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. Same with a* b because they're real. So 2*(sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 )= 2*(sqrt(3)/2) )= sqrt(3).\n\nWait, that's different from what I got before. Oh no, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, what's the correct formula for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 in terms of a and b?\n\nLet me think. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you compute \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9, it's (a*, b*) * \u03c3x * (a, b)^T.\n\nSo let me compute it step by step. Let me write \u03c8 as (a, b) = (0.5, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo \u03c3x * \u03c8 is (b, a) = (sqrt(3)/2, 0.5).\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c3x | \u03c8\u27e9 is a*b + b*a = a b + b a = 2 a b.\n\nWait, because a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * (sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAh, that's the same result as before. So I didn't make a mistake earlier. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866.\n\nSo putting it back into the expectation value of the operator:\n\n10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = (-5) +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWhich is approximately -0.7, so the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, let me compute more precisely.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.7320508075688772.\n\nSo sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660254037844386.\n\n5 * 0.8660254037844386 = 4.330127018922193.\n\n10*(-0.5)= -5.\n\nAdding them: -5 +4.330127018922193= -0.669872981077807.\n\nRounded to one decimal place: -0.7.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is C) -0.7.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the expectation value of the operator \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) for a spin-half particle in the state \\( \\psi = 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle \\), where \\( |\\uparrow\\rangle \\) and \\( |\\downarrow\\rangle \\) are eigenstates of \\( \\sigma_z \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. The states |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are the eigenstates of \u03c3z, the Pauli z-matrix. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. And the options are given as A to D.\n\nHmm, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket of the state with the operator applied. So \u27e8\u03c8| O |\u03c8\u27e9, where O is the operator and \u03c8 is the state.\n\nWait, the operator here is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So I can probably compute the expectation value of each part separately and then add them together.\n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The expectation value of 10\u03c3z plus the expectation value of 5\u03c3x. So that's 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nSince \u03c3z and \u03c3x are Pauli matrices, their expectation values can be found by projecting the state onto their respective eigenstates.\n\nWait, but wait. The state is already a combination of \u03c3z eigenstates. So for \u03c3z, the expectation value might be easier to compute. Because |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are the eigenstates of \u03c3z, the expectation value of \u03c3z for a state in this basis is just the coefficient squared times their eigenvalues.\n\nRight, the eigenvalues for \u03c3z are +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9. So for the state \u03c8 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1).\n\nSo let's compute that. The coefficients here are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let's square them: (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75. So |a|^2 is 0.25, |b|^2 is 0.75.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So the expectation value of \u03c3z is -0.5.\n\nBut wait, the operator is 10\u03c3z, so 10 times that would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\nNow for the \u03c3x part. Oh, \u03c3x is a bit trickier because its eigenstates aren't the same as \u03c3z. So how do I compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 for this state?\n\nI remember that \u03c3x has eigenstates that are superpositions of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value using the matrix representation.\n\nThe Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So for a state \u03c8 = [a; b], where a is the coefficient of |\u2191\u27e9 and b of |\u2193\u27e9, the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is (a*, b*) times \u03c3x times (a; b).\n\nSo let me write out the state vector. Our state is \u03c8 = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Let me compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nWait, \u03c8 is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So \u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So \u03c3x * \u03c8 would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then, \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8 is the dot product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nCalculating that: (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5. Let's compute each term: 0.5 is 1/2, so each term is (1/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. So adding both terms: sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, but wait, the expectation value of \u03c3x is this number. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because when I think about it, for a spin in a state that's a superposition of \u03c3z eigenstates, the expectation value of \u03c3x depends on the angles in the Bloch sphere. Let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to write the expectation value as (\u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8) = a*b* + a* b + b* a + b a* ? Wait no, maybe I should express it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it correctly. Let me re-express \u03c8 as a column vector: \u03c8 = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nCompute \u03c3x \u03c8: \u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying by \u03c8 gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So the inner product is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.\n\nWhich is (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo that's correct. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me make sure about the dimensions. The state is a spin-1/2 particle, so the state is a 2-dimensional vector. The expectation value of \u03c3x is computed as the above.\n\nSo the expectation value for 5\u03c3x would be 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 5 * 0.866 \u2248 4.33.\n\nSo putting it all together, the expectation value of 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nWait, 10\u03c3z gives 10 * (-0.5) = -5.\n\n5\u03c3x gives 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 5 * 0.866 \u2248 4.33.\n\nAdding them together: -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205. So sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866025.\n\nSo 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = 5 * 0.866025 \u2248 4.330125.\n\n10\u03c3z gives 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\nSo adding: -5 +4.330125 \u2248 -0.669875.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.669875.\n\nRounded to one decimal place, that would be -0.7.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is -0.7.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the state is 0.5 |\u2191> + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193>. Let's compute the normalization: 0.5^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1, so it's normalized. Good.\n\nFor \u03c3z: the expectation is |0.5|^2*(1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2*(-1) = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10\u03c3z gives 10*(-0.5) = -5. That's correct.\n\nFor \u03c3x: the expectation is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866. So 5\u03c3x gives 5*(sqrt(3)/2) \u22484.330.\n\nAdding: -5 +4.330 \u2248-0.670, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which is option C.\n",

So \u03c3x * \u03c8 would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then, \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8 is the dot product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nCalculating that: (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5. Let's compute each term: 0.5 is 1/2, so each term is (1/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. So adding both terms: sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, but wait, the expectation value of \u03c3x is this number. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because when I think about it, for a spin in a state that's a superposition of \u03c3z eigenstates, the expectation value of \u03c3x depends on the angles in the Bloch sphere. Let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to write the expectation value as (\u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8) = a*b* + a* b + b* a + b a* ? Wait no, maybe I should express it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it correctly. Let me re-express \u03c8 as a column vector: \u03c8 = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nCompute \u03c3x \u03c8: \u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying by \u03c8 gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So the inner product is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.\n\nWhich is (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo that's correct. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me make sure about the dimensions. The state is a spin-1/2 particle, so the state is a 2-dimensional vector. The expectation value of \u03c3x is computed as the above.\n\nSo the expectation value for 5\u03c3x would be 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 5 * 0.866 \u2248 4.33.\n\nSo putting it all together, the expectation value of 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nWait, 10\u03c3z gives 10 * (-0.5) = -5.\n\n5\u03c3x gives 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 5 * 0.866 \u2248 4.33.\n\nAdding them together: -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205. So sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866025.\n\nSo 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = 5 * 0.866025 \u2248 4.330125.\n\n10\u03c3z gives 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\nSo adding: -5 +4.330125 \u2248 -0.669875.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.669875.\n\nRounded to one decimal place, that would be -0.7.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is -0.7.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the state is 0.5 |\u2191> + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193>. Let's compute the normalization: 0.5^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1, so it's normalized. Good.\n\nFor \u03c3z: the expectation is |0.5|^2*(1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2*(-1) = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10\u03c3z gives 10*(-0.5) = -5. That's correct.\n\nFor \u03c3x: the expectation is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866. So 5\u03c3x gives 5*(sqrt(3)/2) \u22484.330.\n\nAdding: -5 +4.330 \u2248-0.670, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) for the given state \\( \\psi = 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. I remember that |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are the eigenstates of the \u03c3z operator. The task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z + 5\u03c3x.\n\nHmm, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is found by taking the conjugate transpose of the state, multiplying the operator, and then multiplying by the state again. So \u27e8A\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8| A |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nBut wait, the operator here is a combination of \u03c3z and \u03c3x. Maybe I can compute the expectation values of each separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, let's note the state \u03c8. It's 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. Let me check if this state is normalized. The coefficients squared should add up to 1. So (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. 0.25 + 0.75 = 1, so yes, it's normalized. Good, that saves some steps.\n\nThe operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation value will be 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nI need to find \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 separately.\n\nStarting with \u03c3z. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, it's easier. The expectation value of \u03c3z is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.\n\nFor \u03c3z, the eigenvalues are +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9. So the state is \u03c8 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, where a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1). \n\nCalculating that: |a|\u00b2 = 0.25, |b|\u00b2 = 0.75. So 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. \n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -0.5.\n\nNext, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are not |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, but rather the superpositions (|+x\u27e9 and |\u2212x\u27e9 states). So calculating \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 might be a bit trickier.\n\nAlternatively, I can write \u03c3x in terms of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so \u03c3x = |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191| + |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193|.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nLet me compute this. The state \u03c8 is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis. So the bra is (0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ), but since the coefficients are real, it's just (0.5, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, \u03c3x is represented by the matrix:\n\n[ [0, 1],\n  [1, 0] ]\n\nSo when I compute \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9, it's the same as:\n\n[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the matrix multiplication is:\n\nThe ket vector is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. So \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then \u27e8\u03c8| (\u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9) is the dot product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nSo let's calculate that: (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|\u03c8\u27e9 + |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193|\u03c8\u27e9. So,\n\n\u27e8\u2191|\u03c8\u27e9 is 0.5, so |\u2193\u27e9 multiplied by 0.5. Similarly, \u27e8\u2193|\u03c8\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2, so |\u2191\u27e9 multiplied by that. So \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2) |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nThen \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is (0.5 \u27e8\u2191| + sqrt(3)/2 \u27e8\u2193| ) (0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 )\n\nSo expanding this: 0.5 * 0.5 \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9.\n\nBut \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 and \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 are zero, so only the diagonal terms remain.\n\nSo 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) * 1 (from \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9) ) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) *1 (from \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9).\n\nWhich is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, but earlier I got the same result using matrix multiplication. So yes, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.\n\nSo putting it all together, the expectation value of 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n10*(-0.5) is -5. 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5*sqrt(3))/2. What's sqrt(3)? Approximately 1.732. So 5*1.732 is about 8.66, divided by 2 is 4.33.\n\nSo -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more accurately.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205. So 5*1.73205 is 8.66025. Divided by 2 is 4.330125.\n\nSo 10*\u03c3z gives -5, plus 4.330125 gives -0.669875.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5 * 1.732)/2 \u2248 (8.66)/2 = 4.33.\n\nSo 10*(-0.5) is -5. So -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I have:\n\nOptions:\nA) -1.4\nB) 1.65\nC) -0.7\nD) 0.85\n\nHmm, -0.67 is close to option C) -0.7, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the exact values.\n\nCompute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -0.5, as before.\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.8660254.\n\nSo 5*sqrt(3)/2 is 5*(1.73205)/2 = (8.66025)/2 =4.330125.\n\nSo 10*\u03c3z is 10*(-0.5)= -5.\n\nSo total expectation value is -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875, approximately -0.67.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is C) -0.7. But wait, the question says up to one decimal place. So -0.67 would be -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.\n\nWait, 0.669875 is approximately 0.67. So when rounded to one decimal, it's 0.7, but with the negative sign, it's -0.7. So option C is correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I computed \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express the state in terms of the eigenstates of \u03c3x. The expectation value of \u03c3x is the sum of probabilities times the eigenvalues.\n\nThe eigenstates of \u03c3x are |+x\u27e9 and |-x\u27e9, which are (|\u2191\u27e9 + |\u2193\u27e9)/sqrt(2) and (|\u2191\u27e9 - |\u2193\u27e9)/sqrt(2), respectively. The eigenvalues are +1 and -1.\n\nSo let me express \u03c8 in terms of |+x\u27e9 and |-x\u27e9.\n\nLet me write \u03c8 as a|+x\u27e9 + b|-x\u27e9. Then \u03c8 is a*(|\u2191\u27e9 + |\u2193\u27e9)/sqrt(2) + b*(|\u2191\u27e9 - |\u2193\u27e9)/sqrt(2).\n\nWhich simplifies to [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ) |\u2191\u27e9 ] + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ) |\u2193\u27e9 ].\n\nComparing this to the original \u03c8, which is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9, we can set up the equations:\n\n(a + b)/sqrt(2) = 0.5\n\n(a - b)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(3)/2\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) a + b = 0.5 * sqrt(2)\n2) a - b = (sqrt(3)/2) * sqrt(2) = sqrt(6)/2\n\nLet me compute sqrt(2) \u22481.4142, so 0.5 * sqrt(2) \u22480.7071.\n\nsqrt(6) is about 2.4495, so sqrt(6)/2 \u22481.2247.\n\nSo equation 1: a + b \u22480.7071\n\nEquation 2: a - b \u22481.2247\n\nAdding the two equations: 2a \u2248 0.7071 +1.2247 =1.9318 \u2192 a\u22480.9659.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 2b \u22481.2247 -0.7071=0.5176 \u2192 b\u22480.2588.\n\nSo a\u22480.9659, b\u22480.2588.\n\nThen \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1).\n\nCompute |a|^2: (0.9659)^2 \u22480.933.\n\n|b|^2: (0.2588)^2\u22480.06699.\n\nSo 0.933 - 0.06699 \u22480.866.\n\nWhich is the same as sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866. So that's correct.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is indeed approximately 0.866.\n\nSo going back to the expectation value of 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x:\n\n-5 +5*(0.866) = -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nSo about -0.67. To one decimal place, that's -0.7. So option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I have the right operator. The operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option C) -0.7.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. I remember that |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are the eigenstates of the \u03c3z operator. The task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z + 5\u03c3x.\n\nHmm, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is found by taking the conjugate transpose of the state, multiplying the operator, and then multiplying by the state again. So \u27e8A\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8| A |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nBut wait, the operator here is a combination of \u03c3z and \u03c3x. Maybe I can compute the expectation values of each separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, let's note the state \u03c8. It's 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. Let me check if this state is normalized. The coefficients squared should add up to 1. So (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. 0.25 + 0.75 = 1, so yes, it's normalized. Good, that saves some steps.\n\nThe operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation value will be 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nI need to find \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 separately.\n\nStarting with \u03c3z. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, it's easier. The expectation value of \u03c3z is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.\n\nFor \u03c3z, the eigenvalues are +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9. So the state is \u03c8 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, where a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1). \n\nCalculating that: |a|\u00b2 = 0.25, |b|\u00b2 = 0.75. So 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. \n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -0.5.\n\nNext, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are not |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, but rather the superpositions (|+x\u27e9 and |\u2212x\u27e9 states). So calculating \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 might be a bit trickier.\n\nAlternatively, I can write \u03c3x in terms of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so \u03c3x = |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191| + |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193|.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nLet me compute this. The state \u03c8 is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis. So the bra is (0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ), but since the coefficients are real, it's just (0.5, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, \u03c3x is represented by the matrix:\n\n[ [0, 1],\n  [1, 0] ]\n\nSo when I compute \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9, it's the same as:\n\n[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the matrix multiplication is:\n\nThe ket vector is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. So \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then \u27e8\u03c8| (\u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9) is the dot product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nSo let's calculate that: (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|\u03c8\u27e9 + |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193|\u03c8\u27e9. So,\n\n\u27e8\u2191|\u03c8\u27e9 is 0.5, so |\u2193\u27e9 multiplied by 0.5. Similarly, \u27e8\u2193|\u03c8\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2, so |\u2191\u27e9 multiplied by that. So \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2) |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nThen \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is (0.5 \u27e8\u2191| + sqrt(3)/2 \u27e8\u2193| ) (0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 )\n\nSo expanding this: 0.5 * 0.5 \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9.\n\nBut \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 and \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 are zero, so only the diagonal terms remain.\n\nSo 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) * 1 (from \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9) ) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) *1 (from \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9).\n\nWhich is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, but earlier I got the same result using matrix multiplication. So yes, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.\n\nSo putting it all together, the expectation value of 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n10*(-0.5) is -5. 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5*sqrt(3))/2. What's sqrt(3)? Approximately 1.732. So 5*1.732 is about 8.66, divided by 2 is 4.33.\n\nSo -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more accurately.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205. So 5*1.73205 is 8.66025. Divided by 2 is 4.330125.\n\nSo 10*\u03c3z gives -5, plus 4.330125 gives -0.669875.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5 * 1.732)/2 \u2248 (8.66)/2 = 4.33.\n\nSo 10*(-0.5) is -5. So -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I have:\n\nOptions:\nA) -1.4\nB) 1.65\nC) -0.7\nD) 0.85\n\nHmm, -0.67 is close to option C) -0.7, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the exact values.\n\nCompute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -0.5, as before.\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.8660254.\n\nSo 5*sqrt(3)/2 is 5*(1.73205)/2 = (8.66025)/2 =4.330125.\n\nSo 10*\u03c3z is 10*(-0.5)= -5.\n\nSo total expectation value is -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875, approximately -0.67.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is C) -0.7. But wait, the question says up to one decimal place. So -0.67 would be -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.\n\nWait, 0.669875 is approximately 0.67. So when rounded to one decimal, it's 0.7, but with the negative sign, it's -0.7. So option C is correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I computed \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express the state in terms of the eigenstates of \u03c3x. The expectation value of \u03c3x is the sum of probabilities times the eigenvalues.\n\nThe eigenstates of \u03c3x are |+x\u27e9 and |-x\u27e9, which are (|\u2191\u27e9 + |\u2193\u27e9)/sqrt(2) and (|\u2191\u27e9 - |\u2193\u27e9)/sqrt(2), respectively. The eigenvalues are +1 and -1.\n\nSo let me express \u03c8 in terms of |+x\u27e9 and |-x\u27e9.\n\nLet me write \u03c8 as a|+x\u27e9 + b|-x\u27e9. Then \u03c8 is a*(|\u2191\u27e9 + |\u2193\u27e9)/sqrt(2) + b*(|\u2191\u27e9 - |\u2193\u27e9)/sqrt(2).\n\nWhich simplifies to [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ) |\u2191\u27e9 ] + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ) |\u2193\u27e9 ].\n\nComparing this to the original \u03c8, which is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9, we can set up the equations:\n\n(a + b)/sqrt(2) = 0.5\n\n(a - b)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(3)/2\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) a + b = 0.5 * sqrt(2)\n2) a - b = (sqrt(3)/2) * sqrt(2) = sqrt(6)/2\n\nLet me compute sqrt(2) \u22481.4142, so 0.5 * sqrt(2) \u22480.7071.\n\nsqrt(6) is about 2.4495, so sqrt(6)/2 \u22481.2247.\n\nSo equation 1: a + b \u22480.7071\n\nEquation 2: a - b \u22481.2247\n\nAdding the two equations: 2a \u2248 0.7071 +1.2247 =1.9318 \u2192 a\u22480.9659.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 2b \u22481.2247 -0.7071=0.5176 \u2192 b\u22480.2588.\n\nSo a\u22480.9659, b\u22480.2588.\n\nThen \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1).\n\nCompute |a|^2: (0.9659)^2 \u22480.933.\n\n|b|^2: (0.2588)^2\u22480.06699.\n\nSo 0.933 - 0.06699 \u22480.866.\n\nWhich is the same as sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866. So that's correct.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is indeed approximately 0.866.\n\nSo going back to the expectation value of 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x:\n\n-5 +5*(0.866) = -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nSo about -0.67. To one decimal place, that's -0.7. So option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I have the right operator. The operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option C) -0.7.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) for the given spin-half particle in the state \\( \\psi = 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of an operator. Hmm, let's see what the question is. \n\nAlright, the problem states that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2|\u2193\u27e9. And these |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, the Pauli z-matrix. The operator we're looking at is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. I need to find the expectation value of this operator, up to one decimal place. The options are given, so I'll have to compute it step by step.\n\nWait, expectation value. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the same state. The formula is \u27e8\u03c8|O|\u03c8\u27e9, where O is the operator and |\u03c8\u27e9 is the state.\n\nSo the operator here is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. Let me think about how to compute the expectation value. Oh right, expectation values are linear, so I can split this into two parts: 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. That should make it easier.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9. Since the state is a linear combination of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, which are eigenstates of \u03c3z, this should be straightforward. The expectation value of \u03c3z is just the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nWait, what's the eigenvalue for |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 in \u03c3z? Oh right, \u03c3z|\u2191\u27e9 = +1|\u2191\u27e9, and \u03c3z|\u2193\u27e9 = -1|\u2193\u27e9. So the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1).\n\nCalculating that: (0.25)*1 + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -0.5.\n\nNow for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3x is the Pauli x matrix, and I need the expectation value in the given state. I remember that the expectation value of \u03c3x for a state |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9 is (a^2 + b^2) multiplied by some terms, but I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, I can compute it directly using the definition.\n\nWait, \u03c3x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you apply \u03c3x to |\u2191\u27e9, it becomes |\u2193\u27e9, and vice versa. So the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nLet me compute that. The state |\u03c8\u27e9 is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. So the conjugate transpose, \u27e8\u03c8|, is 0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193|.\n\nSo when I multiply \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9, I get:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 = (0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2 \u27e8\u2193|) * \u03c3x * (0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9 )\n\nBreaking it down, \u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9, and \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9. So:\n\n= 0.5\u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x (0.5|\u2191\u27e9) ) + 0.5\u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x (sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9 ) \n+ (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x (0.5|\u2191\u27e9 ) \n+ (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x (sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9 )\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: 0.5 * 0.5 * \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9. Wait, \u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2193\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 = 0. So this term is zero.\n\nSecond term: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9. \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 =1. So this term is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 * 1 = (sqrt(3))/4 \u2248 0.4330.\n\nThird term: (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 * \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9. \u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2193\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 =1. So this term is sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 *1 = sqrt(3)/4 \u2248 0.4330.\n\nFourth term: (sqrt(3)/2) * (sqrt(3)/2) * \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9. \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 is 0. So this term is zero.\n\nAdding the second and third terms: 0.4330 + 0.4330 \u2248 0.8660. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, but wait, another way to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is to note that for a state |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, the expectation value is 2Re(ab^*). Because \u03c3x has expectation value (a^2 + b^2) ? Wait, no, I think the correct formula is \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = |a|^2 - |b|^2 + 2 Re(a b^* ), but wait, no, that's for the expectation of another operator. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: The expectation value of \u03c3x can also be found using the formula:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) + 2 Re( a b^* )\n\nBecause \u03c3x can be written in terms of its eigenstates, but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, since \u03c3x is Hermitian, and the eigenstates are |+x\u27e9 and |-x\u27e9, but maybe that's complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it via matrix representation. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe state |\u03c8\u27e9 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Because |\u2191\u27e9 is [1,0], |\u2193\u27e9 is [0,1], so the state is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nThe Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to compute \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9, I can compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and \u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] \u2192 which is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nThen, multiply by \u03c8: [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] * [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nWait, that's the dot product: (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866. So that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nNow, going back to the original operator: 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. The expectation value is 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nWe have \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = -0.5 and \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = (-5) + (4.33) = -0.67.\n\nWait, wait, 10*(-0.5) is -5. 5 * 0.866 is 4.33. So adding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but wait, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.8660254, so 5 times that is 4.330127.\n\nSo 10*(-0.5) is -5, plus 4.330127 is -0.669873. So approximately -0.67.\n\nBut the options are given to one decimal place. So -0.67 rounds to -0.7. Because the second decimal is 6, which rounds up the first decimal from 6 to 7. Wait, no, wait: -0.67 is between -0.6 and -0.7. The first decimal is 6, the next digit is 7, which is >=5, so you round up the first decimal. So 6 becomes 7. So -0.7.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, another approach to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. The state is 0.5 |\u2191> + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193>. Let me compute the probability amplitudes.\n\nThe general formula for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) + 2 Re( a b^* ), where a is the amplitude of |\u2191>, and b is the amplitude of |\u2193>.\n\nIn this case, a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo |a|^2 = 0.25, |b|^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.\n\nSo (0.25 - 0.75) = -0.5.\n\nThen, 2 Re(a b^* ). Since a and b are real numbers here, a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.\n\na b^* is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 \u2248 0.433. So Re(a b^*) is the same, 0.433.\n\nMultiply by 2: 2*(sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo the total expectation is -0.5 + 0.866 = 0.366. Wait, that's different from what I found earlier. Wait, no, wait, no, wait. I think I messed up the formula. Wait, I thought \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is (|a|^2 - |b|^2) + 2 Re(a b^* ), but perhaps that's not correct.\n\nWait, no, I think the correct formula is:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = (|a|^2 - |b|^2) + 2 Re( a b^* )\n\nWait, let's see. Let me calculate it with the matrix approach again. The state is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\n\u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Then multiply by \u03c8: [sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 ] + [0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ] = sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo the correct expectation is 0.866, so that previous approach with the formula must have been incorrect. Maybe the formula I thought of was for another operator. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 2 Re( a b^* ), because when the state is |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, then \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2 Re( a b^* ) ?\n\nWait, let me compute that: a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.\n\na b^* = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. Re(a b^*) is sqrt(3)/4. So 2 times that is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866. So that's correct.\n\nSo the formula is \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2 Re( a b^* ). Because |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1, so (|a|^2 - |b|^2) would be (0.25 -0.75) = -0.5, but that's not part of the formula.\n\nWait, so perhaps I was mistaken earlier about the formula. The correct formula for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 2 Re( a b^* ), since in this case, that gives 0.866, which matches the matrix method.\n\nSo going back, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 0.866, and \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -0.5.\n\nSo the operator's expectation is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = -5 +4.33= -0.67.\n\nWait, 10*(-0.5) is -5, 5*0.866 is approximately 4.33. So -5 +4.33 is -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me just check once again to be certain.\n\nAnother way to think about it: since the state is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2), the expectation of \u03c3z is the first component squared minus the second component squared: (0.5)^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that's correct.\n\nAnd for \u03c3x, it's 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*( sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, 10*(-0.5) is -5, and 5*0.866 is approximately 4.33. So adding those gives -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of an operator. Hmm, let's see what the question is. \n\nAlright, the problem states that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2|\u2193\u27e9. And these |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, the Pauli z-matrix. The operator we're looking at is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. I need to find the expectation value of this operator, up to one decimal place. The options are given, so I'll have to compute it step by step.\n\nWait, expectation value. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the same state. The formula is \u27e8\u03c8|O|\u03c8\u27e9, where O is the operator and |\u03c8\u27e9 is the state.\n\nSo the operator here is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. Let me think about how to compute the expectation value. Oh right, expectation values are linear, so I can split this into two parts: 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. That should make it easier.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9. Since the state is a linear combination of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, which are eigenstates of \u03c3z, this should be straightforward. The expectation value of \u03c3z is just the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nWait, what's the eigenvalue for |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 in \u03c3z? Oh right, \u03c3z|\u2191\u27e9 = +1|\u2191\u27e9, and \u03c3z|\u2193\u27e9 = -1|\u2193\u27e9. So the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1).\n\nCalculating that: (0.25)*1 + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -0.5.\n\nNow for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3x is the Pauli x matrix, and I need the expectation value in the given state. I remember that the expectation value of \u03c3x for a state |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9 is (a^2 + b^2) multiplied by some terms, but I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, I can compute it directly using the definition.\n\nWait, \u03c3x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you apply \u03c3x to |\u2191\u27e9, it becomes |\u2193\u27e9, and vice versa. So the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nLet me compute that. The state |\u03c8\u27e9 is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. So the conjugate transpose, \u27e8\u03c8|, is 0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193|.\n\nSo when I multiply \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9, I get:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 = (0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2 \u27e8\u2193|) * \u03c3x * (0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9 )\n\nBreaking it down, \u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9, and \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9. So:\n\n= 0.5\u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x (0.5|\u2191\u27e9) ) + 0.5\u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x (sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9 ) \n+ (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x (0.5|\u2191\u27e9 ) \n+ (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x (sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9 )\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: 0.5 * 0.5 * \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9. Wait, \u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2193\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 = 0. So this term is zero.\n\nSecond term: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9. \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 =1. So this term is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 * 1 = (sqrt(3))/4 \u2248 0.4330.\n\nThird term: (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 * \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9. \u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2193\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 =1. So this term is sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 *1 = sqrt(3)/4 \u2248 0.4330.\n\nFourth term: (sqrt(3)/2) * (sqrt(3)/2) * \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9. \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 is 0. So this term is zero.\n\nAdding the second and third terms: 0.4330 + 0.4330 \u2248 0.8660. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, but wait, another way to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is to note that for a state |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, the expectation value is 2Re(ab^*). Because \u03c3x has expectation value (a^2 + b^2) ? Wait, no, I think the correct formula is \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = |a|^2 - |b|^2 + 2 Re(a b^* ), but wait, no, that's for the expectation of another operator. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: The expectation value of \u03c3x can also be found using the formula:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) + 2 Re( a b^* )\n\nBecause \u03c3x can be written in terms of its eigenstates, but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, since \u03c3x is Hermitian, and the eigenstates are |+x\u27e9 and |-x\u27e9, but maybe that's complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it via matrix representation. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe state |\u03c8\u27e9 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Because |\u2191\u27e9 is [1,0], |\u2193\u27e9 is [0,1], so the state is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nThe Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to compute \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9, I can compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and \u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] \u2192 which is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nThen, multiply by \u03c8: [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] * [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nWait, that's the dot product: (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866. So that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nNow, going back to the original operator: 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. The expectation value is 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nWe have \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = -0.5 and \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = (-5) + (4.33) = -0.67.\n\nWait, wait, 10*(-0.5) is -5. 5 * 0.866 is 4.33. So adding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but wait, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.8660254, so 5 times that is 4.330127.\n\nSo 10*(-0.5) is -5, plus 4.330127 is -0.669873. So approximately -0.67.\n\nBut the options are given to one decimal place. So -0.67 rounds to -0.7. Because the second decimal is 6, which rounds up the first decimal from 6 to 7. Wait, no, wait: -0.67 is between -0.6 and -0.7. The first decimal is 6, the next digit is 7, which is >=5, so you round up the first decimal. So 6 becomes 7. So -0.7.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, another approach to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. The state is 0.5 |\u2191> + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193>. Let me compute the probability amplitudes.\n\nThe general formula for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) + 2 Re( a b^* ), where a is the amplitude of |\u2191>, and b is the amplitude of |\u2193>.\n\nIn this case, a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo |a|^2 = 0.25, |b|^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.\n\nSo (0.25 - 0.75) = -0.5.\n\nThen, 2 Re(a b^* ). Since a and b are real numbers here, a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.\n\na b^* is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 \u2248 0.433. So Re(a b^*) is the same, 0.433.\n\nMultiply by 2: 2*(sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo the total expectation is -0.5 + 0.866 = 0.366. Wait, that's different from what I found earlier. Wait, no, wait, no, wait. I think I messed up the formula. Wait, I thought \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is (|a|^2 - |b|^2) + 2 Re(a b^* ), but perhaps that's not correct.\n\nWait, no, I think the correct formula is:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = (|a|^2 - |b|^2) + 2 Re( a b^* )\n\nWait, let's see. Let me calculate it with the matrix approach again. The state is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\n\u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Then multiply by \u03c8: [sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 ] + [0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ] = sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo the correct expectation is 0.866, so that previous approach with the formula must have been incorrect. Maybe the formula I thought of was for another operator. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 2 Re( a b^* ), because when the state is |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, then \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2 Re( a b^* ) ?\n\nWait, let me compute that: a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.\n\na b^* = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. Re(a b^*) is sqrt(3)/4. So 2 times that is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866. So that's correct.\n\nSo the formula is \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2 Re( a b^* ). Because |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1, so (|a|^2 - |b|^2) would be (0.25 -0.75) = -0.5, but that's not part of the formula.\n\nWait, so perhaps I was mistaken earlier about the formula. The correct formula for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 2 Re( a b^* ), since in this case, that gives 0.866, which matches the matrix method.\n\nSo going back, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 0.866, and \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -0.5.\n\nSo the operator's expectation is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = -5 +4.33= -0.67.\n\nWait, 10*(-0.5) is -5, 5*0.866 is approximately 4.33. So -5 +4.33 is -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me just check once again to be certain.\n\nAnother way to think about it: since the state is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2), the expectation of \u03c3z is the first component squared minus the second component squared: (0.5)^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that's correct.\n\nAnd for \u03c3x, it's 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*( sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, 10*(-0.5) is -5, and 5*0.866 is approximately 4.33. So adding those gives -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) for the given spin-half particle in the state \\( |\\psi\\rangle = 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.\n\nAlright, the problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. Wait, wait. I remember that for spin systems, |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of the \u03c3z operator. So \u03c3z |\u2191\u27e9 = +1|\u2191\u27e9 and \u03c3z |\u2193\u27e9 = -1|\u2193\u27e9, right?\n\nThe operator given is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. I need to find the expectation value of this operator. Oh right, expectation value is \u27e8\u03c8| O |\u03c8\u27e9 where O is the operator and |\u03c8\u27e9 is the state.\n\nSo the expectation value is \u27e8\u03c8| (10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x) |\u03c8\u27e9. Which can be split into two parts: 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nI think I can compute each expectation value separately. Let me start with \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9.\n\nSince \u03c3z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, the expectation value of \u03c3z is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.\n\nThe state is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. So the probability for |\u2191\u27e9 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and for |\u2193\u27e9 it's (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. So \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = 0.25*(+1) + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\nWait, that's right? Because when you square the coefficients, 0.5^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4). So yes, that gives 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\nSo 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\nNow for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Oh, \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which I think is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation value of \u03c3x is \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a spin-\u00bd system, the expectation value of \u03c3x can be found using the formula involving the coefficients of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nWait, let me think. If the state is |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, then \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is (a b* + a* b) because \u03c3x = |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| + |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|. So that would be 2 Re(ab*).\n\nWait, let me compute that. Let's write a and b.\n\nIn this case, a = 0.5, which is 1/2, and b = sqrt(3)/2. So ab* is (1/2)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. So 2 Re(ab*) is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866...\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Let me write out the components.\n\nThe state is |\u03c8\u27e9 = c_\u2191 |\u2191\u27e9 + c_\u2193 |\u2193\u27e9. So to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, it's \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\n\u03c3x in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you apply it to |\u03c8\u27e9, it swaps the components. So let me write |\u03c8\u27e9 as a column vector [c_\u2191; c_\u2193]. Then \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [c_\u2193, c_\u2191]^T.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [c_\u2191*, c_\u2193*] [c_\u2193, c_\u2191]^T, which is c_\u2191* c_\u2193 + c_\u2193* c_\u2191. That's the same as 2 Re(c_\u2191* c_\u2193).\n\nSo c_\u2191 is 0.5, c_\u2193 is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo c_\u2191* c_\u2193 = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. The real part of this is sqrt(3)/4, because it's already real. So 2 times that is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me compute it more precisely. So sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 5 * 0.866 \u2248 4.33.\n\nWait, so the total expectation value is 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = (-5) + (4.33) = -0.67?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation of \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the explicit matrix elements.\n\nLet me write |\u03c8\u27e9 as a vector. So |\u2191\u27e9 is [1; 0], |\u2193\u27e9 is [0;1]. So |\u03c8\u27e9 is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ].\n\nThen \u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].\n\nThen \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is the inner product of [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ] with [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5 ].\n\nWhich is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.\n\nSo that's (sqrt(3)/4 ) + (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo yes, that's correct. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is about 0.866.\n\nSo 5 * 0.866 is approximately 4.33.\n\nSo the total expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = (-5) +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but the options are given to one decimal place. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, let me compute exactly. Let me do exact fractions.\n\n\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = (0.5)^2 * 1 + ( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) * (-1) = (1/4) - (3/4) = (-2/4) = -1/2. So that's exact.\n\nSo 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is 10*(-1/2) = -5.\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is (0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2 )) * 2 because 2 Re(ab*) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is (5 * sqrt(3))/2.\n\nSo sqrt(3) is about 1.73205, so (5 * 1.73205)/2 \u2248 (8.66025)/2 \u22484.330125.\n\nSo the total expectation value is (-5) +4.330125 = -0.669875.\n\nRounded to one decimal place, that's approximately -0.7.\n\nWait, but wait, let me calculate it more precisely.\n\nWait, 5 times sqrt(3)/2 is (5 * 1.7320508075688772935)/2.\n\nSo 5 * 1.7320508075688772935 = 8.660254037844386.\n\nDivide by 2: 4.330127018922193.\n\nSo 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -5, plus 4.330127018922193 gives -0.669872981077807.\n\nSo -0.669872981... which is approximately -0.67. So when rounded to one decimal, it's -0.7.\n\nWait, because the first decimal is 6 (tenths place is -0.6), but wait, wait no: wait, -0.6698 is approximately -0.67, which to one decimal place is -0.7?\n\nWait no, wait, when rounding to one decimal place, you look at the second decimal. So for example, 0.666 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal. But wait, the number is -0.6698. So the first decimal is 6, the second is 6.\n\nWait, 0.666... would round to 0.7 when rounded to one decimal. But 0.66 is 0.7? No, wait, wait. Wait, 0.66 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal? No, wait, wait. Let me think.\n\nWait, 0.66 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Because 0.66 is closer to 0.7 than to 0.6. No, wait, 0.66 is 0.66, which is 0.66. To round to one decimal, the first decimal is 6, the next digit is 6, which is \u22655, so you round up. So 0.66 becomes 0.7.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. The actual number is -0.6698. So the first decimal is 6, the second is 6. So when rounding to one decimal, we look at the second decimal digit, which is 6. So we round the first decimal (6) up by one, which would make it 7. So -0.6698 becomes approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. The number is -0.6698. So the tenths place is 6, hundredths is 6, thousandths is 9, ten-thousandths is 8.\n\nWait, when rounding to one decimal place, we look at the first digit after the decimal (the tenths) and the next digit (the hundredths). So for example, 0.66: tenths is 6, hundredths is 6. Since 6 \u22655, we round the tenths up by one, making it 7. So 0.66 rounded to one decimal is 0.7.\n\nSimilarly, -0.6698 is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.7.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is -0.7.\n\nWait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) -1.4\n\nB)1.65\n\nC) -0.7\n\nD)0.85\n\nSo the answer should be option C, -0.7.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.\n\nAlright, the problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. Wait, wait. I remember that for spin systems, |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of the \u03c3z operator. So \u03c3z |\u2191\u27e9 = +1|\u2191\u27e9 and \u03c3z |\u2193\u27e9 = -1|\u2193\u27e9, right?\n\nThe operator given is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. I need to find the expectation value of this operator. Oh right, expectation value is \u27e8\u03c8| O |\u03c8\u27e9 where O is the operator and |\u03c8\u27e9 is the state.\n\nSo the expectation value is \u27e8\u03c8| (10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x) |\u03c8\u27e9. Which can be split into two parts: 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nI think I can compute each expectation value separately. Let me start with \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9.\n\nSince \u03c3z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, the expectation value of \u03c3z is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.\n\nThe state is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. So the probability for |\u2191\u27e9 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and for |\u2193\u27e9 it's (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. So \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = 0.25*(+1) + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\nWait, that's right? Because when you square the coefficients, 0.5^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4). So yes, that gives 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\nSo 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\nNow for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Oh, \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which I think is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation value of \u03c3x is \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a spin-\u00bd system, the expectation value of \u03c3x can be found using the formula involving the coefficients of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nWait, let me think. If the state is |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, then \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is (a b* + a* b) because \u03c3x = |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| + |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|. So that would be 2 Re(ab*).\n\nWait, let me compute that. Let's write a and b.\n\nIn this case, a = 0.5, which is 1/2, and b = sqrt(3)/2. So ab* is (1/2)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. So 2 Re(ab*) is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866...\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Let me write out the components.\n\nThe state is |\u03c8\u27e9 = c_\u2191 |\u2191\u27e9 + c_\u2193 |\u2193\u27e9. So to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, it's \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\n\u03c3x in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you apply it to |\u03c8\u27e9, it swaps the components. So let me write |\u03c8\u27e9 as a column vector [c_\u2191; c_\u2193]. Then \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [c_\u2193, c_\u2191]^T.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [c_\u2191*, c_\u2193*] [c_\u2193, c_\u2191]^T, which is c_\u2191* c_\u2193 + c_\u2193* c_\u2191. That's the same as 2 Re(c_\u2191* c_\u2193).\n\nSo c_\u2191 is 0.5, c_\u2193 is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo c_\u2191* c_\u2193 = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. The real part of this is sqrt(3)/4, because it's already real. So 2 times that is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me compute it more precisely. So sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 5 * 0.866 \u2248 4.33.\n\nWait, so the total expectation value is 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = (-5) + (4.33) = -0.67?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation of \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the explicit matrix elements.\n\nLet me write |\u03c8\u27e9 as a vector. So |\u2191\u27e9 is [1; 0], |\u2193\u27e9 is [0;1]. So |\u03c8\u27e9 is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ].\n\nThen \u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].\n\nThen \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is the inner product of [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ] with [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5 ].\n\nWhich is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.\n\nSo that's (sqrt(3)/4 ) + (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo yes, that's correct. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is about 0.866.\n\nSo 5 * 0.866 is approximately 4.33.\n\nSo the total expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = (-5) +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but the options are given to one decimal place. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, let me compute exactly. Let me do exact fractions.\n\n\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = (0.5)^2 * 1 + ( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) * (-1) = (1/4) - (3/4) = (-2/4) = -1/2. So that's exact.\n\nSo 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is 10*(-1/2) = -5.\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is (0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2 )) * 2 because 2 Re(ab*) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is (5 * sqrt(3))/2.\n\nSo sqrt(3) is about 1.73205, so (5 * 1.73205)/2 \u2248 (8.66025)/2 \u22484.330125.\n\nSo the total expectation value is (-5) +4.330125 = -0.669875.\n\nRounded to one decimal place, that's approximately -0.7.\n\nWait, but wait, let me calculate it more precisely.\n\nWait, 5 times sqrt(3)/2 is (5 * 1.7320508075688772935)/2.\n\nSo 5 * 1.7320508075688772935 = 8.660254037844386.\n\nDivide by 2: 4.330127018922193.\n\nSo 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -5, plus 4.330127018922193 gives -0.669872981077807.\n\nSo -0.669872981... which is approximately -0.67. So when rounded to one decimal, it's -0.7.\n\nWait, because the first decimal is 6 (tenths place is -0.6), but wait, wait no: wait, -0.6698 is approximately -0.67, which to one decimal place is -0.7?\n\nWait no, wait, when rounding to one decimal place, you look at the second decimal. So for example, 0.666 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal. But wait, the number is -0.6698. So the first decimal is 6, the second is 6.\n\nWait, 0.666... would round to 0.7 when rounded to one decimal. But 0.66 is 0.7? No, wait, wait. Wait, 0.66 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal? No, wait, wait. Let me think.\n\nWait, 0.66 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Because 0.66 is closer to 0.7 than to 0.6. No, wait, 0.66 is 0.66, which is 0.66. To round to one decimal, the first decimal is 6, the next digit is 6, which is \u22655, so you round up. So 0.66 becomes 0.7.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. The actual number is -0.6698. So the first decimal is 6, the second is 6. So when rounding to one decimal, we look at the second decimal digit, which is 6. So we round the first decimal (6) up by one, which would make it 7. So -0.6698 becomes approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. The number is -0.6698. So the tenths place is 6, hundredths is 6, thousandths is 9, ten-thousandths is 8.\n\nWait, when rounding to one decimal place, we look at the first digit after the decimal (the tenths) and the next digit (the hundredths). So for example, 0.66: tenths is 6, hundredths is 6. Since 6 \u22655, we round the tenths up by one, making it 7. So 0.66 rounded to one decimal is 0.7.\n\nSimilarly, -0.6698 is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.7.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is -0.7.\n\nWait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) -1.4\n\nB)1.65\n\nC) -0.7\n\nD)0.85\n\nSo the answer should be option C, -0.7.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) for the given spin-half particle in the state \\( |\\psi\\rangle = 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. The states |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of the \u03c3z operator. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. The options are given as A to D.\n\nHmm, expectation values. Right, the expectation value of an operator gives the average value we'd measure if we measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. For a given state, the expectation value is calculated as the conjugate transpose (bra) of the state multiplied by the operator acting on the state (ket).\n\nWait, so the formula is \u27e8\u03c8| (operator) |\u03c8\u27e9. Since \u03c3z and \u03c3x are Hermitian operators, their expectation values should be real numbers.\n\nBut wait, the state is already given as a linear combination of the eigenstates of \u03c3z, which is helpful. Let me note down the state \u03c8 first.\n\nThe state \u03c8 is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. Let me compute the normalization to make sure it's a valid quantum state. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1.\n\nSo, (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Yep, that's normalized. Good.\n\nNow, the operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation value \u27e810\u03c3z +5\u03c3x\u27e9 would be 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 because expectation values are linear. So I can compute each term separately.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, the expectation value of \u03c3z in state \u03c8 will be straightforward.\n\nThe eigenvalues for \u03c3z are +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9. So the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nThe probability of being in |\u2191\u27e9 is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, so 0.25 * (+1) = 0.25.\n\nThe probability of being in |\u2193\u27e9 is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 3/4, so 3/4 * (-1) = -0.75.\n\nAdding them together: 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = -0.5.\n\nThen, 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = 10 * (-0.5) = -5. Okay, that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part is 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are |+\u27e9 and |\u2212\u27e9, which are superpositions of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9. So maybe I need to compute the expectation value of \u03c3x in the state \u03c8.\n\nWait, how do I compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 for a given state? Let me think. The expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is equal to the expectation value of the operator \u03c3x in the state \u03c8. So I can write it as:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express \u03c3x in terms of the basis states. The Pauli matrices are:\n\n\u03c3z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\u03c3x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n\nSo, \u03c3x in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis is represented by the matrix:\n[ [0 1],\n  [1 0] ]\n\nSo, to compute \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9, I can express this as the inner product.\n\nLet me write \u03c8 as a column vector. Let's see, |\u2191\u27e9 is [1; 0], |\u2193\u27e9 is [0; 1]. So \u03c8 is 0.5 [1; 0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0;1], so the vector is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo \u03c8 = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nThen, \u03c3x is the 2x2 matrix [[0,1],[1,0]].\n\nSo \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 would be:\n\n[0 1; 1 0] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].\n\nThen, the bra \u27e8\u03c8| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], because it's the conjugate transpose, but the coefficients are real here, so just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo the inner product \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5] = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.\n\nLet me compute that: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt(3)/4. The second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5, which is also sqrt(3)/4. So adding them gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, let's double-check the multiplication.\n\nWait, the matrix product \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5], right? Then \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is the dot product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] with [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].\n\nSo (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, but that's positive. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The state is a superposition of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, and \u03c3x is the spin in the x-direction. The expectation value is sqrt(3)/2. That seems a bit high, but I think it's correct. Let me think about another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the expectation value of \u03c3x can be found using the formula:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2 * ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) if the state is a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, but wait no, that's for \u03c3z. Hmm, no, wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which is (|\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| + |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|). So when you compute \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9, it's the sum over the coefs a and b, etc.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the general formula for expectation values of Pauli matrices. The expectation value of \u03c3i for a state |\u03c8\u27e9 is given by the Bloch vector components. So for a qubit state |\u03c8\u27e9 = cos(\u03b8/2)|0\u27e9 + e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)|1\u27e9, the expectation values are:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6,\n\n\u27e8\u03c3y\u27e9 = sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6,\n\n\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, but in our case, the state is written as 0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. Let me write this in the |0\u27e9, |1\u27e9 basis, assuming |\u2191\u27e9 is |0\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 is |1\u27e9. So the state is (0.5)|0\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|1\u27e9.\n\nWait, so cos(\u03b8/2) = 0.5, so \u03b8/2 would be 60 degrees because cos(60) is 0.5. So \u03b8 is 120 degrees. Then, sin(\u03b8/2) is sin(60) = sqrt(3)/2, which matches the coefficient of |1\u27e9. So phi is zero because the state has no phase factor, as the coefficients are real and positive.\n\nSo the expectation values would be:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6.\n\n\u03b8 is 120 degrees, which is 2\u03c0/3 radians. So sin(2\u03c0/3) is sqrt(3)/2. cos\u03c6 is cos(0) = 1. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/2) * 1 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier. So that's correct. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 5 * 0.866 \u2248 4.33.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me compute that again: sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866, yes. So 5 times that is 4.33.\n\nNow, adding the two parts: 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nWhich is (-5) + 4.33 \u2248 -0.67.\n\nWait, but wait, that's not matching any of the options given. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA) -1.4\nB) 1.65\nC) -0.7\nD) 0.85\n\nWait, none of these are -0.67. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Let me recheck that.\n\nWait, another approach: the expectation value of \u03c3x is (\u03c8_x), which is the real part of the coefficient in the Bloch sphere representation. Alternatively, I can compute it using matrix multiplication.\n\nThe state \u03c8 is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo \u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]].\n\nSo, \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is the inner product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nSo, 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3)/4) \u2248 0.4330.\n\nPlus, (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = (sqrt(3)/4) \u2248 0.4330.\n\nAdding them: 0.4330 + 0.4330 = 0.8660.\n\nSo that's correct. So 5 times that is 5 * 0.8660 = 4.33.\n\nThen, 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\nSo total expectation value is (-5) + 4.33 = -0.67.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have -0.67. The closest is option C, which is -0.7. But wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculation.\n\nWait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.8660254.\n\nSo 5 times that is 5 * 0.8660254 \u2248 4.330127.\n\nThen, 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -5.\n\nSo sum is 4.330127 -5 = -0.669873.\n\nRounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait, why did I get -0.67 when I thought it would be -0.7? Because when rounded to one decimal place, 0.669873 is 0.7 when negative. So yes, -0.7 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, let me recheck all steps again.\n\nAnother approach: Let me write the operator 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. The expectation value is \u27e8\u03c8| (10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x) |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nWhich is 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nWe have already found \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = -0.5.\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 0.8660254, so 5 times that is 4.330127.\n\nSo 10*(-0.5) is -5.0.\n\nAdding: 4.330127 -5.0 = -0.669873, which is approximately -0.67.\n\nWhen rounded to one decimal place, it's -0.7, because the next digit is 6, which is >=5, so it rounds up. So -0.7.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the operator. Oh wait, the operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So I'm calculating the expectation value correctly, right?\n\nYes, I think so. So the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. The states |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of the \u03c3z operator. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. The options are given as A to D.\n\nHmm, expectation values. Right, the expectation value of an operator gives the average value we'd measure if we measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. For a given state, the expectation value is calculated as the conjugate transpose (bra) of the state multiplied by the operator acting on the state (ket).\n\nWait, so the formula is \u27e8\u03c8| (operator) |\u03c8\u27e9. Since \u03c3z and \u03c3x are Hermitian operators, their expectation values should be real numbers.\n\nBut wait, the state is already given as a linear combination of the eigenstates of \u03c3z, which is helpful. Let me note down the state \u03c8 first.\n\nThe state \u03c8 is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. Let me compute the normalization to make sure it's a valid quantum state. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1.\n\nSo, (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Yep, that's normalized. Good.\n\nNow, the operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation value \u27e810\u03c3z +5\u03c3x\u27e9 would be 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 because expectation values are linear. So I can compute each term separately.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, the expectation value of \u03c3z in state \u03c8 will be straightforward.\n\nThe eigenvalues for \u03c3z are +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9. So the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nThe probability of being in |\u2191\u27e9 is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, so 0.25 * (+1) = 0.25.\n\nThe probability of being in |\u2193\u27e9 is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 3/4, so 3/4 * (-1) = -0.75.\n\nAdding them together: 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = -0.5.\n\nThen, 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = 10 * (-0.5) = -5. Okay, that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part is 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are |+\u27e9 and |\u2212\u27e9, which are superpositions of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9. So maybe I need to compute the expectation value of \u03c3x in the state \u03c8.\n\nWait, how do I compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 for a given state? Let me think. The expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is equal to the expectation value of the operator \u03c3x in the state \u03c8. So I can write it as:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express \u03c3x in terms of the basis states. The Pauli matrices are:\n\n\u03c3z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\u03c3x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n\nSo, \u03c3x in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis is represented by the matrix:\n[ [0 1],\n  [1 0] ]\n\nSo, to compute \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9, I can express this as the inner product.\n\nLet me write \u03c8 as a column vector. Let's see, |\u2191\u27e9 is [1; 0], |\u2193\u27e9 is [0; 1]. So \u03c8 is 0.5 [1; 0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0;1], so the vector is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo \u03c8 = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nThen, \u03c3x is the 2x2 matrix [[0,1],[1,0]].\n\nSo \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 would be:\n\n[0 1; 1 0] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].\n\nThen, the bra \u27e8\u03c8| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], because it's the conjugate transpose, but the coefficients are real here, so just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo the inner product \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5] = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.\n\nLet me compute that: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt(3)/4. The second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5, which is also sqrt(3)/4. So adding them gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, let's double-check the multiplication.\n\nWait, the matrix product \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5], right? Then \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is the dot product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] with [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].\n\nSo (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, but that's positive. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The state is a superposition of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, and \u03c3x is the spin in the x-direction. The expectation value is sqrt(3)/2. That seems a bit high, but I think it's correct. Let me think about another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the expectation value of \u03c3x can be found using the formula:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2 * ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) if the state is a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, but wait no, that's for \u03c3z. Hmm, no, wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which is (|\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| + |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|). So when you compute \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9, it's the sum over the coefs a and b, etc.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the general formula for expectation values of Pauli matrices. The expectation value of \u03c3i for a state |\u03c8\u27e9 is given by the Bloch vector components. So for a qubit state |\u03c8\u27e9 = cos(\u03b8/2)|0\u27e9 + e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)|1\u27e9, the expectation values are:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6,\n\n\u27e8\u03c3y\u27e9 = sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6,\n\n\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, but in our case, the state is written as 0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9.

So the state is (0.5)|0\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|1\u27e9.\n\nWait, so cos(\u03b8/2) = 0.5, so \u03b8/2 would be 60 degrees because cos(60) is 0.5. So \u03b8 is 120 degrees. Then, sin(\u03b8/2) is sin(60) = sqrt(3)/2, which matches the coefficient of |1\u27e9. So phi is zero because the state has no phase factor, as the coefficients are real and positive.\n\nSo the expectation values would be:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6.\n\n\u03b8 is 120 degrees, which is 2\u03c0/3 radians. So sin(2\u03c0/3) is sqrt(3)/2. cos\u03c6 is cos(0) = 1. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/2) * 1 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier. So that's correct. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 5 * 0.866 \u2248 4.33.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me compute that again: sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866, yes. So 5 times that is 4.33.\n\nNow, adding the two parts: 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nWhich is (-5) + 4.33 \u2248 -0.67.\n\nWait, but wait, that's not matching any of the options given.

So yes, -0.7 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, let me recheck all steps again.\n\nAnother approach: Let me write the operator 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. The expectation value is \u27e8\u03c8| (10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x) |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nWhich is 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nWe have already found \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = -0.5.\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 0.8660254, so 5 times that is 4.330127.\n\nSo 10*(-0.5) is -5.0.\n\nAdding: 4.330127 -5.0 = -0.669873, which is approximately -0.67.\n\nWhen rounded to one decimal place, it's -0.7, because the next digit is 6, which is >=5, so it rounds up. So -0.7.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the operator. Oh wait, the operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So I'm calculating the expectation value correctly, right?\n\nYes, I think so. So the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) for the given quantum state \\( \\psi = 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle \\). The expectation value is computed as:\n\n\\[\n\\langle 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\rangle = 10\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle + 5\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( \\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle \\)\nThe eigenstates \\( |\\uparrow\\rangle \\) and \\( |\\downarrow\\rangle \\) of \\( \\sigma_z \\) have eigenvalues \\( +1 \\) and \\( -1 \\), respectively. The expectation value of \\( \\sigma_z \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle = \\text{Prob}(|\\uparrow\\rangle)(+1) + \\text{Prob}(|\\downarrow\\rangle)(-1)\n\\]\n\nThe probabilities are calculated as the squared magnitudes of the coefficients of \\( |\\uparrow\\rangle \\) and \\( |\\downarrow\\rangle \\) in \\( \\psi \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Prob}(|\\uparrow\\rangle) = |0.5|^2 = 0.25, \\quad \\text{Prob}(|\\downarrow\\rangle) = \\left|\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right|^2 = 0.75\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\\[\n\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute \\( \\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle \\)\nThe Pauli \\( \\sigma_x \\) operator is represented in the \\( |\\uparrow\\rangle, |\\downarrow\\rangle \\) basis as:\n\\[\n\\sigma_x = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe state \\( \\psi \\) can be written as a column vector:\n\\[\n\\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe action of \\( \\sigma_x \\) on \\( \\psi \\) is:\n\\[\n\\sigma_x \\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ 0.5 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe expectation value \\( \\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle \\) is the inner product of \\( \\psi \\) and \\( \\sigma_x \\psi \\):\n\\[\n\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | \\sigma_x \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ 0.5 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle = 0.5 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 0.5 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732 \\), we find:\n\\[\n\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle \\approx \\frac{1.732}{2} \\approx 0.866\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine Results\nThe expectation value of \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) is:\n\\[\n\\langle 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\rangle = 10\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle + 5\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\langle 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place\nRounding \\( -0.67 \\) to one decimal place gives \\( -0.7 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe expectation value of \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) is approximately \\( -0.7 \\), which corresponds to **Option C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of an operator. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that a spin-half particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. And the question is about the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x.\n\nWait, right. The expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable on a large number of identical systems in the same state. So I'll need to compute the expectation value of each part separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, let me recall what \u03c3z and \u03c3x are. \u03c3z is the Pauli z-matrix, and \u03c3x is the Pauli x-matrix. Their matrix forms are:\n\n\u03c3z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\u03c3x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n\nThe given state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of \u03c3z. So for \u03c3z, the expectation value should be straightforward because |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are its eigenstates.\n\nWait, the state is \u03c8 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. Let me check if this is a normalized state. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1. So (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. Yep, it's normalized.\n\nNow, the expectation value of \u03c3z, \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9, is given by the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. So |\u2191\u27e9 has eigenvalue +1, and |\u2193\u27e9 has eigenvalue -1.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = (0.5)^2 *1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1) = 0.25 *1 + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that. The coefficient for |\u2191\u27e9 is 0.5, so its amplitude squared is 0.25. For |\u2193\u27e9, the coefficient is sqrt(3)/2, so amplitude squared is (3/4). So 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNext, the operator 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation value is 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. I already have \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 as -0.5, so 10*(-0.5) is -5.\n\nNow I need to find \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Since \u03c3x is not diagonal in the \u03c3z basis, I can't just take the probabilities. I'll have to compute it explicitly.\n\nThe expectation value of \u03c3x is \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9. Let me write down the state in vector form. Since |\u2191\u27e9 is [1, 0] and |\u2193\u27e9 is [0,1], the state \u03c8 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo \u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the matrix multiplication for \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 would be:\n\n[0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)*] multiplied by \u03c3x multiplied by [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nWait, better to compute it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, another way: For a spin-1/2 particle, the expectation value of \u03c3x in a state \u03c8 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9 is (a*b* + a* b ) where a* is the complex conjugate of a. Wait, but in this case, the coefficients are real, so it's 2ab.\n\nWait, more accurately, the expectation value of \u03c3x is (a b^* + a^* b). Since a and b are real here, it's 2ab.\n\nWait, let me think again. The matrix representation of \u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you apply \u03c3x to |\u03c8\u27e9, you get [b, a]^T. Then \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 is the dot product of [a, b] and [b, a], which is a*b + b*a = 2ab.\n\nSo yes, for real coefficients a and b, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 2ab.\n\nIn our case, a is 0.5 and b is sqrt(3)/2. So 2 * 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (2 * 0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) )= 1 * (sqrt(3)/2) )= sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866...\n\nWait, let me compute that again. 2 * (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = (2 * 0.5) = 1, times (sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo putting it all together, the expectation value of 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (-5) + (5*sqrt(3)/2).\n\nWait, let me compute 5*(sqrt(3)/2): 5 * 0.866 is approximately 4.33.\n\nSo 4.33 -5 = -0.67.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute it more precisely.\n\nsqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 5 * 0.866 is 4.33. So 10\u03c3z part is -5, and 5\u03c3x is 4.33. So total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but wait: the question says to compute the expectation value up to one decimal place. So -0.67 rounds to -0.7, but wait, because 0.67 is closer to 0.7 than 0.6? Wait, 0.67 is 0.67, which is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are given as A) -1.4, B)1.65, C)-0.7, D)0.85. So option C is -0.7. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Let me go back.\n\nSo the state \u03c8 is 0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2) |\u2193\u27e9. So in vector form, it's [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. The expectation value of \u03c3x is \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8. So let's compute this.\n\n\u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Then \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So the dot product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = (0.5 * 0.866) + (0.866 * 0.5) = 0.433 + 0.433 = 0.866, which is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866. So yes, correct.\n\nSo 5\u03c3x gives 5*(0.866) = 4.33. 10\u03c3z is 10*(-0.5) = -5. So total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, -0.67 is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I missed a factor somewhere.\n\nAnother approach: the operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation value is 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nWe have \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = -0.5, so 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866, so 5*0.866 \u22484.33.\n\nAdding these: -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Rounded to one decimal, that's -0.7. So the answer is C.\n",

So the dot product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = (0.5 * 0.866) + (0.866 * 0.5) = 0.433 + 0.433 = 0.866, which is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866. So yes, correct.\n\nSo 5\u03c3x gives 5*(0.866) = 4.33. 10\u03c3z is 10*(-0.5) = -5. So total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, -0.67 is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I missed a factor somewhere.\n\nAnother approach: the operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation value is 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nWe have \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = -0.5, so 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866, so 5*0.866 \u22484.33.\n\nAdding these: -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Rounded to one decimal, that's -0.7. So the answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) for the given state \\( \\psi = 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle \\). The expectation value is computed as \\( \\langle 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\rangle = 10\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle + 5\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle \\). \n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( \\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle \\)\nThe eigenstates \\( |\\uparrow\\rangle \\) and \\( |\\downarrow\\rangle \\) of \\( \\sigma_z \\) correspond to eigenvalues \\( +1 \\) and \\( -1 \\), respectively. The state \\( \\psi \\) is a linear combination of these eigenstates, so the expectation value of \\( \\sigma_z \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle = (0.5)^2 \\cdot (+1) + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 \\cdot (-1).\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle = 0.25 \\cdot (+1) + 0.75 \\cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute \\( \\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle \\)\nThe operator \\( \\sigma_x \\) is not diagonal in the \\( \\sigma_z \\) basis. For a state \\( \\psi = a|\\uparrow\\rangle + b|\\downarrow\\rangle \\), the expectation value of \\( \\sigma_x \\) is:\n\\[\n\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle = 2ab,\n\\]\nwhere \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the coefficients of \\( |\\uparrow\\rangle \\) and \\( |\\downarrow\\rangle \\), respectively. Here, \\( a = 0.5 \\) and \\( b = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\). Substituting:\n\\[\n\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle = 2 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.\n\\]\nApproximating \\( \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732 \\), we find:\n\\[\n\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle \\approx \\frac{1.732}{2} \\approx 0.866.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine Results\nThe expectation value of \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) is:\n\\[\n\\langle 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\rangle = 10\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle + 5\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( \\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle = -0.5 \\) and \\( \\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle \\approx 0.866 \\):\n\\[\n\\langle 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.\n\\]\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \\( -0.7 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe expectation value of \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) is closest to option **C) -0.7**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. I remember that |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are the eigenstates of the \u03c3z operator. So the state is a combination of these states.\n\nThe question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. Oh right, the expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured this operator many times on the same state.\n\nI think I should calculate the expectation value of each term separately and then add them up. So E = <\u03c8|10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x |\u03c8> = 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nFirst, I'll find \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, this should be easier. The eigenvalues for \u03c3z are +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9, right?\n\nThe state \u03c8 is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. So the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThe expectation value of \u03c3z is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. So that's |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1).\n\nLet me compute that. |0.5|\u00b2 is 0.25, and |sqrt(3)/2|\u00b2 is (3/4), which is 0.75. So 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -0.5.\n\nSo 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is 10*(-0.5) = -5. That's part one done.\n\nNow, the harder part: \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which flips the spin states. The eigenstates of \u03c3x are not |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, so I can't directly use the same approach as with \u03c3z. I'll need to compute the expectation value more directly.\n\nThe expectation value of \u03c3x is given by \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9. Let me write out the state \u03c8 as a vector. Since |\u2191\u27e9 is often represented as [1; 0] and |\u2193\u27e9 as [0;1], then \u03c8 would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, in the standard basis, |\u2191\u27e9 is [1, 0]^T and |\u2193\u27e9 is [0,1]^T. So \u03c8 is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9, which in vector form is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nThe Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So \u03c3x in matrix form is:\n\n0 1\n1 0\n\nSo to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, I can compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nAlternatively, I can expand the expectation value as the sum over all i and j of \u03c8_i* (\u03c3x)_ij \u03c8_j.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nSo let's write it out.\n\n\u03c8 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ].\n\nBut since the coefficients are real here, \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nMultiplying \u03c3x by \u03c8:\n\n\u03c3x * \u03c8 = [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 multiplied by this gives:\n\n0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)* 0.5.\n\nLet me compute that. So 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (sqrt(3))/4. The second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5, which is also sqrt(3)/4. So adding them together gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWait, wait a second. Wait, is that correct? Because when you compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8, it's the sum over all i and j of \u03c8_i* (\u03c3x_ij) \u03c8_j.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute using the formula:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = |a|^2 * \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + a*b* \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 + b*a* \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + |b|^2 \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nWait, but \u03c3x is the Pauli matrix, which when acting on |\u2191\u27e9 gives |\u2193\u27e9 and vice versa. So, \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9, and \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nSo, \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9, which is zero.\n\nSimilarly, \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is zero.\n\nThe cross terms: \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 which is 1, but \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 = 1.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 which is zero.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9, which is zero.\n\nNow, the cross terms: a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = a^* b \u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 + b^* a \u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nWait, but wait, \u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2191| (\u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9) ) = \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, \u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2193| (\u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9) ) = \u27e8\u2193| \u2193 \u27e9 = 1? Wait, no, \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2193\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 = 1.\n\nWait, no, wait. So, the cross terms are a^* b (\u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9) + b^* a (\u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9).\n\nBut wait, \u03c3x is Hermitian, so the matrix is real and symmetric, so the cross terms should be the same.\n\nWait, let's compute each term.\n\nThe first term is a^* b * \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9. As above, \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 = 1.\n\nThe second term is b^* a * \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9. \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2193\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9=1.\n\nSo each cross term is 1.\n\nSo the cross terms are a*b*(1) + a*b*(1), but wait, wait, the coefficients are a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWait, let me be precise. The first term is a* b times 1, the second term is b* a times 1. Since a and b are real, a* =a and b* =b.\n\nSo the cross terms are a*b*(1) + b*a*(1) = 2 a b.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2 a b.\n\nSo a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo 2 * 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2 * (sqrt(3)/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, that's a positive value. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated using the matrix method, I got sqrt(3)/2 as the expectation value. So both methods agree.\n\nSo putting it together, the expectation value of 5\u03c3x is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 5 * 0.866 \u2248 4.33.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my matrix approach.\n\nIn the matrix approach, the expectation value is \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\n\u03c8 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\n\u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]].\n\nSo \u03c3x \u03c8 is [ sqrt(3)/2 , 0.5 ]^T.\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo the product \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8 is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) + ( sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 ) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2, which is the same as before. So that's correct.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo now, putting it all together, the expectation value of 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x is:\n\n10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (-5) + (5 * 0.866) \u2248 (-5) + 4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but wait, 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) is approximately 5 * 0.866 = 4.33.\n\nSo 4.33 -5 is approximately -0.67.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of the options are exactly -0.67. The options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.\n\nWait, so -0.67 is close to -0.7, which is option C. But let me check my calculations again for any possible mistakes.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the expectation value for \u03c3x. Let me go back.\n\nAlternative approach: The expectation value of \u03c3x is given by:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = |a|^2 * (0) + |b|^2 * (0) + a b^* \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 + a^* b \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9.\n\nWait, but in the expansion of \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9, it's:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 = (0.5)(0.5) \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)(sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nWait, but as I said earlier, \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is zero, and \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is zero.\n\nSo the cross terms are (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9.\n\nNow, \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is the inner product between |\u2191\u27e9 and \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nAs \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 =1.\n\nSo each cross term is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) * 1 + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) * 1.\n\nWhich is (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo yes, that's correct. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, going back to the main calculation:\n\n10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\n5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 =5*(sqrt(3)/2) \u22485 * 0.8660 =4.33.\n\nAdding these gives -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nRounding to one decimal place: -0.7.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. I remember that |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are the eigenstates of the \u03c3z operator. So the state is a combination of these states.\n\nThe question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. Oh right, the expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured this operator many times on the same state.\n\nI think I should calculate the expectation value of each term separately and then add them up. So E = <\u03c8|10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x |\u03c8> = 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nFirst, I'll find \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, this should be easier. The eigenvalues for \u03c3z are +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9, right?\n\nThe state \u03c8 is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. So the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThe expectation value of \u03c3z is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. So that's |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1).\n\nLet me compute that. |0.5|\u00b2 is 0.25, and |sqrt(3)/2|\u00b2 is (3/4), which is 0.75. So 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -0.5.\n\nSo 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is 10*(-0.5) = -5. That's part one done.\n\nNow, the harder part: \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which flips the spin states. The eigenstates of \u03c3x are not |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, so I can't directly use the same approach as with \u03c3z. I'll need to compute the expectation value more directly.\n\nThe expectation value of \u03c3x is given by \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9. Let me write out the state \u03c8 as a vector. Since |\u2191\u27e9 is often represented as [1; 0] and |\u2193\u27e9 as [0;1], then \u03c8 would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, in the standard basis, |\u2191\u27e9 is [1, 0]^T and |\u2193\u27e9 is [0,1]^T. So \u03c8 is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9, which in vector form is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nThe Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So \u03c3x in matrix form is:\n\n0 1\n1 0\n\nSo to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, I can compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nAlternatively, I can expand the expectation value as the sum over all i and j of \u03c8_i* (\u03c3x)_ij \u03c8_j.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nSo let's write it out.\n\n\u03c8 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ].\n\nBut since the coefficients are real here, \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nMultiplying \u03c3x by \u03c8:\n\n\u03c3x * \u03c8 = [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 multiplied by this gives:\n\n0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)* 0.5.\n\nLet me compute that. So 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (sqrt(3))/4. The second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5, which is also sqrt(3)/4. So adding them together gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWait, wait a second. Wait, is that correct? Because when you compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8, it's the sum over all i and j of \u03c8_i* (\u03c3x_ij) \u03c8_j.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute using the formula:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = |a|^2 * \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + a*b* \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 + b*a* \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + |b|^2 \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nWait, but \u03c3x is the Pauli matrix, which when acting on |\u2191\u27e9 gives |\u2193\u27e9 and vice versa. So, \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9, and \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nSo, \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9, which is zero.\n\nSimilarly, \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is zero.\n\nThe cross terms: \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 which is 1, but \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 = 1.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 which is zero.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9, which is zero.\n\nNow, the cross terms: a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = a^* b \u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 + b^* a \u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nWait, but wait, \u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2191| (\u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9) ) = \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, \u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2193| (\u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9) ) = \u27e8\u2193| \u2193 \u27e9 = 1? Wait, no, \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2193\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 = 1.\n\nWait, no, wait. So, the cross terms are a^* b (\u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9) + b^* a (\u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9).\n\nBut wait, \u03c3x is Hermitian, so the matrix is real and symmetric, so the cross terms should be the same.\n\nWait, let's compute each term.\n\nThe first term is a^* b * \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9. As above, \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 = 1.\n\nThe second term is b^* a * \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9. \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2193\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9=1.\n\nSo each cross term is 1.\n\nSo the cross terms are a*b*(1) + a*b*(1), but wait, wait, the coefficients are a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWait, let me be precise. The first term is a* b times 1, the second term is b* a times 1. Since a and b are real, a* =a and b* =b.\n\nSo the cross terms are a*b*(1) + b*a*(1) = 2 a b.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2 a b.\n\nSo a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo 2 * 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2 * (sqrt(3)/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, that's a positive value. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated using the matrix method, I got sqrt(3)/2 as the expectation value. So both methods agree.\n\nSo putting it together, the expectation value of 5\u03c3x is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 5 * 0.866 \u2248 4.33.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my matrix approach.\n\nIn the matrix approach, the expectation value is \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\n\u03c8 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\n\u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]].\n\nSo \u03c3x \u03c8 is [ sqrt(3)/2 , 0.5 ]^T.\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo the product \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8 is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) + ( sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 ) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2, which is the same as before. So that's correct.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo now, putting it all together, the expectation value of 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x is:\n\n10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (-5) + (5 * 0.866) \u2248 (-5) + 4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but wait, 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) is approximately 5 * 0.866 = 4.33.\n\nSo 4.33 -5 is approximately -0.67.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of the options are exactly -0.67. The options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.\n\nWait, so -0.67 is close to -0.7, which is option C. But let me check my calculations again for any possible mistakes.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the expectation value for \u03c3x. Let me go back.\n\nAlternative approach: The expectation value of \u03c3x is given by:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = |a|^2 * (0) + |b|^2 * (0) + a b^* \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 + a^* b \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9.\n\nWait, but in the expansion of \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9, it's:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 = (0.5)(0.5) \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)(sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nWait, but as I said earlier, \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is zero, and \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is zero.\n\nSo the cross terms are (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9.\n\nNow, \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is the inner product between |\u2191\u27e9 and \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nAs \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 =1.\n\nSo each cross term is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) * 1 + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) * 1.\n\nWhich is (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo yes, that's correct. So \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, going back to the main calculation:\n\n10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\n5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 =5*(sqrt(3)/2) \u22485 * 0.8660 =4.33.\n\nAdding these gives -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nRounding to one decimal place: -0.7.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) for the given spin-half particle in the state \\( \\psi = 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle \\).
