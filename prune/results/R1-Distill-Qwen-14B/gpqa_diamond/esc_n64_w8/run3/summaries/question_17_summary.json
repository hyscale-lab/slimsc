      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question says the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25\u00b0C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. They want to find the concentration of calcium ions in solution.\n\nWait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca\u00b2+. The reaction is something like Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is given, which is the formation constant, Kf. Right, so the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.\n\nSo, the initial concentration of the complex, let's call it [CaEDTA^2-], is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, it releases Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- ions. The question is about the concentration of Ca\u00b2+.\n\nLet me think about the equilibrium. The reaction is Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u21cc CaEDTA^2-, with K = 5e10. So K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]).\n\nWait, but if the solution is at stoichiometric point, perhaps the concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- are the same? Because the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio. So initially, if all the Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are in the complex, upon dissociation, [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA^4-] = x. \n\nSo, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. When it dissociates, each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca\u00b2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, so without dissociation, the [Ca\u00b2+] would be 0.02 M. But because the complex dissociates a little, [Ca\u00b2+] will be less than 0.02 M. Or wait, no\u2014wait, wait. If the complex is dissociating, it's releasing Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- into the solution. So, the initial [Ca\u00b2+] is zero, and the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, that can't be right because if the complex is in solution, it's at equilibrium with the ions. \n\nWait, maybe I should set up an ICE table. Let me try that.\n\nThe initial concentrations before dissociation would be:\n[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M\n[Ca\u00b2+] = 0 (initially, but wait no\u2014maybe it's not zero because the complex can dissociate. Wait, no, the complex is in solution, so the initial [Ca\u00b2+] is zero, and the complex is 0.02 M. As it dissociates, some of the complex breaks down into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nSo, let's say the change is -x for the complex, and +x for both Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nSo, at equilibrium:\n[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since K is very large, x will be very small, so 0.02 -x \u2248 0.02)\n[Ca\u00b2+] = x\n[EDTA^4-] = x\n\nThen, the K expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10.\n\nWait, so 0.02/(x\u00b2) =5e10 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 0.02/(5e10) \u2192 x\u00b2 = 2e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(2e-13) \u2248 sqrt(2)*1e-6.5.\n\nWait, sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 1.414 * 3.16e-7 \u2248 4.47e-7. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me write it out.\n\nx\u00b2 = (0.02) / (5e10) \u2192 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.\n\nSo x\u00b2 =4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 \u2192 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 \u2248 6.32e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is 6.3e-7 M.\n\nWait, but why does the initial [Ca\u00b2+] equal x? Because the complex dissociates into one Ca\u00b2+ per complex. So yes, the setup seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the fact that EDTA is present in excess, but in this case, since the complex is 0.02 M and assuming it's the only source of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA, then the [Ca\u00b2+] would be x, and [EDTA^4-] would be x, as I did.\n\nSo the answer should be option C, 6.3e-7 M.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and they give me some parameters.\n\nAlright, the problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The pH is ideal, so I don't need to worry about that complicating things. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, which is room temperature, so standard conditions probably. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. \n\nWait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca\u00b2+ tightly. The complex formed is Ca-EDTA, and the stability constant K is a measure of how strong this complex is. A high K like 5e10 means the complex is very stable, so it doesn't dissociate much.\n\nThe question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. So, I'm looking for [Ca\u00b2+].\n\nI think the formula I need is the one that relates the concentration of the complex to the concentrations of the individual ions. The stability constant K is defined as the concentration of the complex divided by the product of the concentrations of the metal ion and the ligand. \n\nSo, K = [Ca-EDTA] / ( [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA] )\n\nBut wait, in this case, the solution is stochiometric, which I think means that all the Ca\u00b2+ is complexed with EDTA. So, the initial concentration of Ca\u00b2+ before complexation is the same as the concentration of the complex, assuming 1:1 ratio. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. If the solution is stochiometric, that probably means that the EDTA and Ca\u00b2+ are present in stoichiometric amounts. So, the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ in solution is [Ca\u00b2+] = [Ca-EDTA]/(K * [EDTA]). Hmm, but wait, that's not quite right. Let me try to model this.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of the formation of the complex. Let me denote the complex as CaY\u00b2\u2212, where Y is EDTA. The formation reaction is:\n\nCa\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212 \n\nThe stability constant K is given by:\n\nK = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] / ( [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-] )\n\nSo, K is 5e10.\n\nIn a solution where the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the EDTA is present in excess, but wait, wait, the solution is stochiometric. Oh, stochiometric usually means that the amounts are exactly in the ratio required for the reaction. So, for each mole of Ca\u00b2+ present, there's a mole of EDTA to form the complex. So, the total concentration of EDTA and Ca\u00b2+ is equal to the concentration of the complex?\n\nWait, no. Let's say the concentration of the complex is [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M. Then, the EDTA in solution would be the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA bound in the complex. But if the solution is stochiometric, perhaps all the EDTA is used to form the complex. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. If the solution is stochiometric, that probably means that all the Ca\u00b2+ is complexed, and there's no free Ca\u00b2+ except what's from the dissociation of the complex. So, the total concentration of EDTA would be equal to the concentration of the complex because each complex has one EDTA.\n\nWait, no. Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, but in the complex, each EDTA is bound to one Ca\u00b2+. So, the total EDTA concentration is the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA in the complex. But if the solution is stochiometric, that might mean that the initial amounts of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio. So, for every mole of Ca\u00b2+ added, a mole of EDTA is present to form the complex.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, perhaps the initial concentration is that the complex is 0.02 M, and the total EDTA is 0.02 M as well, because each complex has one EDTA.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the EDTA in solution would also include the free EDTA. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's approach this with the formula.\n\nLet me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaY] = 0.02 M. The stability constant K = [CaY]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y]).\n\nBut what is [Y]? Y is the free EDTA concentration.\n\nWait, in a solution where the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the EDTA is present in such a way that the solution is stochiometric. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the dissociation of the complex.\n\nThe complex dissociates as:\n\nCaY \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212 \n\nThe dissociation constant, which I think is the inverse of the stability constant. So, Kd = 1/K = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.\n\nThe expression for Kd is [Ca\u00b2+][Y]/[CaY] = 2e-11.\n\nWe know [CaY] is 0.02 M. But we don't know [Y], the free EDTA concentration. Hmm, so we have two variables: [Ca\u00b2+] and [Y]. But without more information, how can we find [Ca\u00b2+]?\n\nWait, perhaps in the case of a stochiometric solution, the concentration of free EDTA is very low because all the EDTA is tied up in the complex. But that doesn't make sense because the complex can dissociate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the term 'stochiometric'. Oh, wait, stochiometric solution usually means that the reagents are present in exact stoichiometric proportions. So, perhaps the solution is made by adding exactly the right amount of EDTA and Ca\u00b2+ to form the complex, so that there's no excess of either. But when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA. So, in the solution, the concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are both equal to [Ca\u00b2+] = [Y], because the complex dissociates into them equally.\n\nAh, so if [Ca\u00b2+] = [Y], then in the Kd equation:\n\n[Ca\u00b2+]\u00b2 / [CaY] = Kd.\n\nWait, let's write that:\n\nKd = [Ca\u00b2+][Y] / [CaY] = ([Ca\u00b2+]^2) / [CaY] = 2e-11.\n\nWe have [CaY] = 0.02 M.\n\nSo, [Ca\u00b2+]^2 = Kd * [CaY] = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.\n\nTaking square root: [Ca\u00b2+] = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?\n\nWait, wait, 4e-13 is 4 *10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 10^-13 is 10^-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7.\n\nSo, 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M. That's approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations. Kd is 1/K, which is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. Right.\n\nSo, Kd = [Ca\u00b2+][Y]/[CaY] = 2e-11.\n\nAssuming [Ca\u00b2+] = [Y] because the solution is stochiometric, so:\n\n[Ca\u00b2+]^2 / 0.02 = 2e-11.\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+]^2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.\n\nSquare root gives [Ca\u00b2+] = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M. So yes, 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.\n",

A high K like 5e10 means the complex is very stable, so it doesn't dissociate much.\n\nThe question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. So, I'm looking for [Ca\u00b2+].\n\nI think the formula I need is the one that relates the concentration of the complex to the concentrations of the individual ions. The stability constant K is defined as the concentration of the complex divided by the product of the concentrations of the metal ion and the ligand. \n\nSo, K = [Ca-EDTA] / ( [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA] )\n\nBut wait, in this case, the solution is stochiometric, which I think means that all the Ca\u00b2+ is complexed with EDTA. So, the initial concentration of Ca\u00b2+ before complexation is the same as the concentration of the complex, assuming 1:1 ratio. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. If the solution is stochiometric, that probably means that the EDTA and Ca\u00b2+ are present in stoichiometric amounts. So, the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ in solution is [Ca\u00b2+] = [Ca-EDTA]/(K * [EDTA]). Hmm, but wait, that's not quite right. Let me try to model this.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of the formation of the complex. Let me denote the complex as CaY\u00b2\u2212, where Y is EDTA. The formation reaction is:\n\nCa\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212 \n\nThe stability constant K is given by:\n\nK = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] / ( [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-] )\n\nSo, K is 5e10.\n\nIn a solution where the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the EDTA is present in excess, but wait, wait, the solution is stochiometric. Oh, stochiometric usually means that the amounts are exactly in the ratio required for the reaction. So, for each mole of Ca\u00b2+ present, there's a mole of EDTA to form the complex. So, the total concentration of EDTA and Ca\u00b2+ is equal to the concentration of the complex?\n\nWait, no. Let's say the concentration of the complex is [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M. Then, the EDTA in solution would be the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA bound in the complex. But if the solution is stochiometric, perhaps all the EDTA is used to form the complex. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. If the solution is stochiometric, that probably means that all the Ca\u00b2+ is complexed, and there's no free Ca\u00b2+ except what's from the dissociation of the complex. So, the total concentration of EDTA would be equal to the concentration of the complex because each complex has one EDTA.\n\nWait, no. Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, but in the complex, each EDTA is bound to one Ca\u00b2+. So, the total EDTA concentration is the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA in the complex. But if the solution is stochiometric, that might mean that the initial amounts of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio. So, for every mole of Ca\u00b2+ added, a mole of EDTA is present to form the complex.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, perhaps the initial concentration is that the complex is 0.02 M, and the total EDTA is 0.02 M as well, because each complex has one EDTA.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the EDTA in solution would also include the free EDTA. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's approach this with the formula.\n\nLet me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaY] = 0.02 M. The stability constant K = [CaY]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y]).\n\nBut what is [Y]? Y is the free EDTA concentration.\n\nWait, in a solution where the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the EDTA is present in such a way that the solution is stochiometric. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the dissociation of the complex.\n\nThe complex dissociates as:\n\nCaY \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212 \n\nThe dissociation constant, which I think is the inverse of the stability constant. So, Kd = 1/K = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.\n\nThe expression for Kd is [Ca\u00b2+][Y]/[CaY] = 2e-11.\n\nWe know [CaY] is 0.02 M. But we don't know [Y], the free EDTA concentration. Hmm, so we have two variables: [Ca\u00b2+] and [Y]. But without more information, how can we find [Ca\u00b2+]?\n\nWait, perhaps in the case of a stochiometric solution, the concentration of free EDTA is very low because all the EDTA is tied up in the complex. But that doesn't make sense because the complex can dissociate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the term 'stochiometric'. Oh, wait, stochiometric solution usually means that the reagents are present in exact stoichiometric proportions. So, perhaps the solution is made by adding exactly the right amount of EDTA and Ca\u00b2+ to form the complex, so that there's no excess of either. But when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA. So, in the solution, the concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are both equal to [Ca\u00b2+] = [Y], because the complex dissociates into them equally.\n\nAh, so if [Ca\u00b2+] = [Y], then in the Kd equation:\n\n[Ca\u00b2+]\u00b2 / [CaY] = Kd.\n\nWait, let's write that:\n\nKd = [Ca\u00b2+][Y] / [CaY] = ([Ca\u00b2+]^2) / [CaY] = 2e-11.\n\nWe have [CaY] = 0.02 M.\n\nSo, [Ca\u00b2+]^2 = Kd * [CaY] = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.\n\nTaking square root: [Ca\u00b2+] = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?\n\nWait, wait, 4e-13 is 4 *10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 10^-13 is 10^-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7.\n\nSo, 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M. That's approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations. Kd is 1/K, which is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. Right.\n\nSo, Kd = [Ca\u00b2+][Y]/[CaY] = 2e-11.\n\nAssuming [Ca\u00b2+] = [Y] because the solution is stochiometric, so:\n\n[Ca\u00b2+]^2 / 0.02 = 2e-11.\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+]^2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.\n\nSquare root gives [Ca\u00b2+] = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M. So yes, 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca\u00b2\u207a]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CaY}^{2-} \\leftrightarrow \\text{Ca}^{2+} + \\text{Y}^{4-}\n\\]\n\nThe dissociation constant \\( K_d \\) is related to the stability constant \\( K_{\\text{Ca-EDTA}} \\) by:\n\n\\[\nK_d = \\frac{1}{K_{\\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}.\n\\]\n\nThe equilibrium expression for \\( K_d \\) is:\n\n\\[\nK_d = \\frac{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\\text{CaY}^{2-}]}.\n\\]\n\nGiven that the solution is stochiometric, the concentrations of free calcium ions and free EDTA ions are equal, i.e., \\( [\\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\\text{Y}^{4-}] \\). Substituting this into the equilibrium expression:\n\n\\[\nK_d = \\frac{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]^2}{[\\text{CaY}^{2-}]}.\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\( [\\text{Ca}^{2+}]^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]^2 = K_d \\cdot [\\text{CaY}^{2-}].\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( K_d = 2 \\times 10^{-11} \\) and \\( [\\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 \\, \\text{M} \\):\n\n\\[\n[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]^2 = (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\cdot 0.02 = 4 \\times 10^{-13}.\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n\\[\n[\\text{Ca}^{2+}] = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \\( 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M} \\), which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium. The pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex effectively.

So Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]).\n\nThe problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So we have to find [Ca\u00b2+]. The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M.

But wait, the formation constant is really large (5e10), which means the complex is very stable. So the dissociation will be minimal, meaning [Ca\u00b2+] will be very small compared to the initial concentration.\n\nLet me set up the variables. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ that dissociates from the complex. So, the initial concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M, and when it dissociates, it produces x M of Ca\u00b2+ and x M of EDTA^4-.\n\nSo, the concentrations at equilibrium would be:\n[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since x is very small compared to 0.02)\n[Ca\u00b2+] = x\n[EDTA^4-] = x\n\nPlugging these into the Kf expression:\nKf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02 / x\u00b2\n\nWe know Kf is 5e10, so:\n5e10 = 0.02 / x\u00b2\n\nSolving for x\u00b2:\nx\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 / 1e1 (wait, wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.)\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that correctly. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also gave the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I guess that means the pH doesn't affect the EDTA's ability to form the complex, which is important because EDTA's effectiveness can depend on pH.\n\nHmm, so what do I remember about EDTA and complex ions? EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions, like Ca^2+, forming a complex. The complex formation is governed by the formation constant, K. The bigger the K, the more stable the complex. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is quite stable because K is 5e10, which is a large number.\n\nThe problem gives the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. Wait, but the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because when the complex forms, most of the calcium is tied up in the complex, so the free calcium concentration should be really low, right?\n\nSo, the reaction I'm considering is: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).\n\nBut wait, in the solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, which probably means that all the Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- have reacted to form the complex. Or maybe not. Wait, the term 'stoichiometric' might mean that the molar amounts are in the exact ratio needed for the reaction, so the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- were equal, but after reaction, the complex is formed.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Let's denote the initial concentrations. Suppose we have a solution where the complex is formed from Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. If the solution has 0.02 M of the complex, that suggests that all the Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- have combined into the complex, but that's not necessarily the case because some might dissociate.\n\nWait, but in reality, the complex doesn't completely form because some Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- remain in solution, but the amount is very small if K is large. Since K is 5e10, which is a big number, the complex is very stable, so the concentrations of free Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are very low.\n\nSo, to model this, let's set up an ICE table. Let me denote:\n\nThe complex is CaEDTA^2- with a concentration of 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.\n\nThe reaction is: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA^2-.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are as follows:\n\n[Ca^2+] = x\n[EDTA^4-] = y\n[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - (x + y) ??? Wait, no, that's not right. Because when the complex dissociates, it produces one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4- per molecule. So, when the complex dissociates by some amount, say, 's', then:\n\n[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - s\n[Ca^2+] = s\n[EDTA^4-] = s\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each complex that dissociates gives one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-. So, assuming that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is 's', then:\n\n[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - s \u2248 0.02 (since K is large, s is very small, so 0.02 - s \u2248 0.02)\n[Ca^2+] = s\n[EDTA^4-] = s\n\nSo, the formation constant expression is:\n\nK = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-])\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n5e10 = (0.02) / (s * s)\n=> 5e10 = 0.02 / s\u00b2\n=> s\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10)\ns\u00b2 = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-13\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that again.\n\nWait, 0.02 is 2e-2.\n\nSo, 2e-2 / (5e10) = (2 /5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.\n\nSo s\u00b2 = 4e-13 \u2192 s = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, square root is 2 * 1e-6.5, which is 2 * 3.16e-7 \u2248 6.32e-7.\n\nWait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Because 1e-6.5 is approx 3.16e-7, right? So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.\n\nSo [Ca^2+] = s = 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The initial setup assumes that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and that the dissociation is s, so the free Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are each s. But wait, what about the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- before the complex formed? Oh, but in this problem, the solution is given as containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentrations of free Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- would be zero? No, that can't be right because the complex can't form if there's nothing to start with. Alternatively, perhaps the 0.02 M is the total concentration of the complex, and we're to find the free calcium.\n\nWait, but in the case where the complex is formed from Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-, the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- would have been such that their product equals [CaEDTA^2-]/K, but I think I'm complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is s. So, the free [Ca^2+] = s, and [EDTA^4-] = s. The formation constant K is 5e10 = [CaEDTA^2-]/(s^2).\n\nSo, solving for s, which is the [Ca^2+], we get s = sqrt([CaEDTA^2-]/K) = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).\n\nWait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = 4e-13, sqrt of that is 2e-6.5, which is 6.32e-7 M.\n\nSo that would make [Ca^2+] = 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also gave the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I guess that means the pH doesn't affect the EDTA's ability to form the complex, which is important because EDTA's effectiveness can depend on pH.\n\nHmm, so what do I remember about EDTA and complex ions? EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions, like Ca^2+, forming a complex. The complex formation is governed by the formation constant, K. The bigger the K, the more stable the complex. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is quite stable because K is 5e10, which is a large number.\n\nThe problem gives the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. Wait, but the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because when the complex forms, most of the calcium is tied up in the complex, so the free calcium concentration should be really low, right?\n\nSo, the reaction I'm considering is: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).\n\nBut wait, in the solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, which probably means that all the Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- have reacted to form the complex. Or maybe not. Wait, the term 'stoichiometric' might mean that the molar amounts are in the exact ratio needed for the reaction, so the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- were equal, but after reaction, the complex is formed.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Let's denote the initial concentrations. Suppose we have a solution where the complex is formed from Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. If the solution has 0.02 M of the complex, that suggests that all the Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- have combined into the complex, but that's not necessarily the case because some might dissociate.\n\nWait, but in reality, the complex doesn't completely form because some Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- remain in solution, but the amount is very small if K is large. Since K is 5e10, which is a big number, the complex is very stable, so the concentrations of free Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are very low.\n\nSo, to model this, let's set up an ICE table. Let me denote:\n\nThe complex is CaEDTA^2- with a concentration of 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.\n\nThe reaction is: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA^2-.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are as follows:\n\n[Ca^2+] = x\n[EDTA^4-] = y\n[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - (x + y) ??? Wait, no, that's not right. Because when the complex dissociates, it produces one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4- per molecule. So, when the complex dissociates by some amount, say, 's', then:\n\n[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - s\n[Ca^2+] = s\n[EDTA^4-] = s\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each complex that dissociates gives one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-. So, assuming that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is 's', then:\n\n[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - s \u2248 0.02 (since K is large, s is very small, so 0.02 - s \u2248 0.02)\n[Ca^2+] = s\n[EDTA^4-] = s\n\nSo, the formation constant expression is:\n\nK = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-])\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n5e10 = (0.02) / (s * s)\n=> 5e10 = 0.02 / s\u00b2\n=> s\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10)\ns\u00b2 = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-13\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that again.\n\nWait, 0.02 is 2e-2.\n\nSo, 2e-2 / (5e10) = (2 /5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.\n\nSo s\u00b2 = 4e-13 \u2192 s = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, square root is 2 * 1e-6.5, which is 2 * 3.16e-7 \u2248 6.32e-7.\n\nWait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Because 1e-6.5 is approx 3.16e-7, right? So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.\n\nSo [Ca^2+] = s = 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The initial setup assumes that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and that the dissociation is s, so the free Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are each s. But wait, what about the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- before the complex formed? Oh, but in this problem, the solution is given as containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.

So, the free [Ca^2+] = s, and [EDTA^4-] = s. The formation constant K is 5e10 = [CaEDTA^2-]/(s^2).\n\nSo, solving for s, which is the [Ca^2+], we get s = sqrt([CaEDTA^2-]/K) = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).\n\nWait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = 4e-13, sqrt of that is 2e-6.5, which is 6.32e-7 M.\n\nSo that would make [Ca^2+] = 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca\u00b2\u207a]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \\( K_{\\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \\times 10^{10} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let's read the problem again. So, the solution has a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They assume the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex properly. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, which is room temperature, so standard conditions, I guess. The given K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10.\n\nWait, K here is the formation constant, right? Formation constants (Kf) tell us how stable a complex is. So K is really big, which means the complex is very stable. So Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA form a complex tightly.\n\nThe question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because when EDTA is present, it binds to Ca\u00b2+ and forms the complex, so the free [Ca\u00b2+] should be low, especially with such a high K.\n\nSo the reaction we're considering is Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212. The formation constant K is [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212]) = 5e10.\n\nBut wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] as 0.02 M initially. But wait, since K is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much. So [Ca\u00b2+] should be really small.\n\nLet me set up an ICE table. Let's think about the dissociation:\n\nCaEDTA\u00b2\u2212 \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4\u2212\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M\n[Ca\u00b2+] = 0\n[EDTA^4\u2212] = 0\n\nChange:\nLet x be the amount that dissociates. So:\n[CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 - x\n[Ca\u00b2+] = x\n[EDTA^4\u2212] = x\n\nBut since K is so large (5e10), x will be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02. So the equation becomes:\n\nK = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x\u00b2 / 0.02\n\nSo x\u00b2 = K * 0.02\n\nPlugging in K =5e10:\n\nx\u00b2 = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9\n\nTaking square root: x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M? Wait, that can't be right. Because 3.16e4 M is way higher than 0.02 M. Wait, that can't be possible. Because if x is larger than 0.02, our approximation that 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 is invalid. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's think again. Wait, K is 5e10, so K is 5e10. So x squared over 0.02 is 5e10.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9. So x is sqrt(1e9) which is 3.16e4 M. But that's impossible because the initial concentration of the complex is only 0.02 M. So x can't be bigger than 0.02. So the assumption that x is negligible is wrong.\n\nWait, so that means I can't make the approximation. So I have to do it without approximating.\n\nSo K = [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212] / [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = 5e10.\n\nSo the equation is x\u00b2 = 5e10 (0.02 - x).\n\nExpanding that: x\u00b2 = 1e9 -5e10 x.\n\nBring all terms to one side: x\u00b2 +5e10 x -1e9 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 +5e10 x -1e9 =0.\n\nWait, but solving this might be tricky. Let me think about the quadratic formula. For ax\u00b2 +bx + c=0, the solution is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a).\n\nHere, a=1, b=5e10, c=-1e9.\n\nSo discriminant D = (5e10)^2 -4*1*(-1e9) = 25e20 +4e9. Well, 4e9 is negligible compared to 25e20. So D \u2248 25e20. Square root of D is 5e10.\n\nSo x = [ -5e10 \u00b15e10 ] / 2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because concentration can't be negative. So x = ( -5e10 +5e10 ) / 2 = 0. But that can't be right. Wait, that would give x=0, which can't be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, K is 5e10. So K = [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212] / [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] = x\u00b2/(0.02 -x) =5e10.\n\nSo x\u00b2 =5e10*(0.02 -x).\n\nSo x\u00b2 =1e9 -5e10 x.\n\nRearranged: x\u00b2 +5e10 x -1e9=0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that 5e10 is a very large coefficient, so perhaps x is much smaller than 0.02. Wait, but earlier the approximation led to x=3e4, which was impossible. So perhaps the correct approach is to see if x is much smaller than 0.02, but in that case, why does the approximation fail?\n\nWait, perhaps the formation constant is so large that the complex doesn't dissociate much. So x should be very small, so 0.02 -x \u22480.02.\n\nBut earlier, when I used that, I got x=3e4, which is impossible because x can't be bigger than 0.02.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the initial assumption that the complex is 0.02 M is in a solution where EDTA is present in excess. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says it's a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of Ca and EDTA comes from this complex. So [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] =0.02 M.\n\nSo in that case, the only source of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4\u2212 is the dissociation of the complex. So the initial concentrations of free Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4\u2212 are zero.\n\nWait, but then the complex can dissociate, but with such a high K, the dissociation is minimal.\n\nWait, but when I used the initial assumption that x is negligible, the calculation gave x as 3e4 M, which is way higher than 0.02 M. So that can't be correct.\n\nSo maybe the problem is that I'm not considering the fact that EDTA is a hexadentate ligand and can form complexes with many metal ions. But in this case, it's already complexed with Ca\u00b2+.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to consider the relationship between the total concentration and the dissociation.\n\nWait, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] =0.02 M.\n\nThe dissociation is [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212] = K * [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212].\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA^4\u2212] = sqrt(K * [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]).\n\nBecause K is so large, [Ca\u00b2+] is sqrt(K * [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]).\n\nWait, K is 5e10, and [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] is 0.02 M.\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] = sqrt(5e10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because 3e4 is way larger than 0.02 M, which would mean that all the complex has dissociated. But that can't be, because K is 5e10, which suggests it's a very stable complex.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the formation constant K is given as [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212]) =5e10. So, rearranged, [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212] = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/(5e10).\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/(5e10 [EDTA^4\u2212]).\n\nBut wait, if the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, and the only source of EDTA is the dissociation, then [EDTA^4\u2212] is equal to [Ca\u00b2+], because for every Ca\u00b2+ that dissociates, one EDTA^4\u2212 is released.\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA^4\u2212] = x.\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [EDTA^4\u2212]=x.\n\nSo K = (0.02)/(x^2) =5e10.\n\nSo x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-12.\n\nSo x = sqrt(4e-12) = 2e-6 M.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because K is 5e10, which is a huge number, so x would be very small.\n\nWait, let me redo this:\n\nK = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212]) =5e10.\n\nWe have [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] =0.02 M.\n\nAssume [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA^4\u2212] = x.\n\nSo K = 0.02/(x^2) =5e10.\n\nSo x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) )= 4e-13.\n\nWait, wait, no: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 =4e-13.\n\nSo x\u00b2 =4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5= approx 3.16e-7.\n\nWait, 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2? Wait, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12. So 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13 = (2e-6.5)^2.\n\nWait, 2e-6.5 is 2 / (10^6.5) = 2/(3.16e6) )= approx 6.32e-7.\n\nWait, because 10^6.5 is sqrt(1e13)=3.16e6.\n\nSo x= sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5=6.32e-7 M.\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let's read the problem again. So, the solution has a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They assume the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex properly. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, which is room temperature, so standard conditions, I guess. The given K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10.\n\nWait, K here is the formation constant, right? Formation constants (Kf) tell us how stable a complex is. So K is really big, which means the complex is very stable. So Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA form a complex tightly.\n\nThe question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because when EDTA is present, it binds to Ca\u00b2+ and forms the complex, so the free [Ca\u00b2+] should be low, especially with such a high K.\n\nSo the reaction we're considering is Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212. The formation constant K is [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212]) = 5e10.\n\nBut wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] as 0.02 M initially. But wait, since K is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much. So [Ca\u00b2+] should be really small.\n\nLet me set up an ICE table. Let's think about the dissociation:\n\nCaEDTA\u00b2\u2212 \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4\u2212\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M\n[Ca\u00b2+] = 0\n[EDTA^4\u2212] = 0\n\nChange:\nLet x be the amount that dissociates. So:\n[CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 - x\n[Ca\u00b2+] = x\n[EDTA^4\u2212] = x\n\nBut since K is so large (5e10), x will be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02. So the equation becomes:\n\nK = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x\u00b2 / 0.02\n\nSo x\u00b2 = K * 0.02\n\nPlugging in K =5e10:\n\nx\u00b2 = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9\n\nTaking square root: x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M? Wait, that can't be right. Because 3.16e4 M is way higher than 0.02 M. Wait, that can't be possible. Because if x is larger than 0.02, our approximation that 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 is invalid. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's think again. Wait, K is 5e10, so K is 5e10. So x squared over 0.02 is 5e10.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9. So x is sqrt(1e9) which is 3.16e4 M. But that's impossible because the initial concentration of the complex is only 0.02 M. So x can't be bigger than 0.02. So the assumption that x is negligible is wrong.\n\nWait, so that means I can't make the approximation. So I have to do it without approximating.\n\nSo K = [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212] / [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = 5e10.\n\nSo the equation is x\u00b2 = 5e10 (0.02 - x).\n\nExpanding that: x\u00b2 = 1e9 -5e10 x.\n\nBring all terms to one side: x\u00b2 +5e10 x -1e9 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 +5e10 x -1e9 =0.\n\nWait, but solving this might be tricky. Let me think about the quadratic formula. For ax\u00b2 +bx + c=0, the solution is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a).\n\nHere, a=1, b=5e10, c=-1e9.\n\nSo discriminant D = (5e10)^2 -4*1*(-1e9) = 25e20 +4e9. Well, 4e9 is negligible compared to 25e20. So D \u2248 25e20. Square root of D is 5e10.\n\nSo x = [ -5e10 \u00b15e10 ] / 2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because concentration can't be negative. So x = ( -5e10 +5e10 ) / 2 = 0. But that can't be right. Wait, that would give x=0, which can't be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, K is 5e10. So K = [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212] / [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] = x\u00b2/(0.02 -x) =5e10.\n\nSo x\u00b2 =5e10*(0.02 -x).\n\nSo x\u00b2 =1e9 -5e10 x.\n\nRearranged: x\u00b2 +5e10 x -1e9=0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that 5e10 is a very large coefficient, so perhaps x is much smaller than 0.02. Wait, but earlier the approximation led to x=3e4, which was impossible. So perhaps the correct approach is to see if x is much smaller than 0.02, but in that case, why does the approximation fail?\n\nWait, perhaps the formation constant is so large that the complex doesn't dissociate much. So x should be very small, so 0.02 -x \u22480.02.\n\nBut earlier, when I used that, I got x=3e4, which is impossible because x can't be bigger than 0.02.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the initial assumption that the complex is 0.02 M is in a solution where EDTA is present in excess. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says it's a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of Ca and EDTA comes from this complex. So [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] =0.02 M.\n\nSo in that case, the only source of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4\u2212 is the dissociation of the complex. So the initial concentrations of free Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4\u2212 are zero.\n\nWait, but then the complex can dissociate, but with such a high K, the dissociation is minimal.\n\nWait, but when I used the initial assumption that x is negligible, the calculation gave x as 3e4 M, which is way higher than 0.02 M. So that can't be correct.\n\nSo maybe the problem is that I'm not considering the fact that EDTA is a hexadentate ligand and can form complexes with many metal ions. But in this case, it's already complexed with Ca\u00b2+.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to consider the relationship between the total concentration and the dissociation.\n\nWait, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] =0.02 M.\n\nThe dissociation is [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212] = K * [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212].\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA^4\u2212] = sqrt(K * [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]).\n\nBecause K is so large, [Ca\u00b2+] is sqrt(K * [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]).\n\nWait, K is 5e10, and [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] is 0.02 M.\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] = sqrt(5e10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because 3e4 is way larger than 0.02 M, which would mean that all the complex has dissociated. But that can't be, because K is 5e10, which suggests it's a very stable complex.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the formation constant K is given as [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212]) =5e10. So, rearranged, [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212] = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/(5e10).\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/(5e10 [EDTA^4\u2212]).\n\nBut wait, if the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, and the only source of EDTA is the dissociation, then [EDTA^4\u2212] is equal to [Ca\u00b2+], because for every Ca\u00b2+ that dissociates, one EDTA^4\u2212 is released.\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA^4\u2212] = x.\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [EDTA^4\u2212]=x.\n\nSo K = (0.02)/(x^2) =5e10.\n\nSo x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-12.\n\nSo x = sqrt(4e-12) = 2e-6 M.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because K is 5e10, which is a huge number, so x would be very small.\n\nWait, let me redo this:\n\nK = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212]) =5e10.\n\nWe have [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] =0.02 M.\n\nAssume [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA^4\u2212] = x.\n\nSo K = 0.02/(x^2) =5e10.\n\nSo x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) )= 4e-13.\n\nWait, wait, no: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 =4e-13.\n\nSo x\u00b2 =4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5= approx 3.16e-7.\n\nWait, 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2? Wait, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12. So 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13 = (2e-6.5)^2.\n\nWait, 2e-6.5 is 2 / (10^6.5) = 2/(3.16e6) )= approx 6.32e-7.\n\nWait, because 10^6.5 is sqrt(1e13)=3.16e6.\n\nSo x= sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5=6.32e-7 M.\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again because I made a mistake earlier when I thought the approximation was invalid.\n\nWait, the initial approach was to set up K=0.02/(x\u00b2)=5e10 \u2192 x\u00b2=0.02/(5e10) =4e-13 \u2192 x= sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5= approx 6.3e-7 M.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

So, the complex is formed by the reaction: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA^2-.\n\nWait, the formation constant Kf is given. I think Kf is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = Kf.\n\nIn this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-, we can model this using the Kf expression.\n\nLet me think about the dissociation. Let's let the concentration of Ca^2+ be x.

The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. Because 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7.\n\nWait, let me compute it properly.

Let's compute x\u00b2 = 0.02 /5e10 \u2192 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 \u2192 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13.\n\nSo x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2 * sqrt(1e-13) \u2192 sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes the formation constant can be given as Kf or Kstab, which is the same as Kf, right?\n\nYes, because Kf is the formation constant, so I think the approach is correct. The complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are equal to x, which comes out to about 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca\u00b2\u207a]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \\( K_{\\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \\times 10^{10} \\). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ca}^{2+} + \\text{EDTA}^{4-} \\leftrightarrow \\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}\n\\]\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the formation constant is:\n\n\\[\nK_{\\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \\frac{[\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}\n\\]\n\nLet the concentration of \\(\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\text{EDTA}^{4-}\\) at equilibrium be \\(x\\). Since the complex dissociates in a 1:1 molar ratio, the concentrations of \\(\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\text{EDTA}^{4-}\\) are equal. The initial concentration of \\(\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}\\) is 0.02 M, so its concentration at equilibrium remains approximately 0.02 M (as dissociation is minimal due to the large \\(K_{\\text{Ca-EDTA}}\\)).\n\nSubstituting into the equilibrium expression:\n\n\\[\nK_{\\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \\frac{0.02}{x^2}\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\(x^2\\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{0.02}{K_{\\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M}\n\\]\n\nThus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \\(6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M}\\).

Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25\u00b0C. The given stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.\n\nHmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is probably CaY\u00b2\u2212, where Y is the EDTA. So the problem is about the dissociation of this complex in solution.\n\nStability constant, K, is a measure of how stable the complex is. A high K means the complex doesn't dissociate much. So in this case, K is 5e10, which is pretty large, so the complex is very stable. That suggests that the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ ions in solution would be very low because most of the Ca is tied up in the complex.\n\nThe solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. Let's think about the dissociation reaction. The complex dissociates as follows: CaY\u00b2\u2212 \u21cc Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212. But wait, wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the charges. EDTA in solution is usually in different forms depending on pH. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its most deprotonated form, Y^4\u2212. So the complex is CaY\u00b2\u2212, which dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212.\n\nThe stability constant K is given by the equation K = [Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212] / [CaY\u00b2\u2212]. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The formation of the complex would be Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212 \u21cc CaY\u00b2\u2212, and the formation constant Kf is [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]). But sometimes, the dissociation constant is the inverse. Oh, wait, in this problem, K_Ca-EDTA is given as 5e10. So I need to be careful which direction the reaction is going.\n\nWait, no, the stability constant, K, is for the dissociation of the complex into its ions. Wait, no, I think it's more accurate to say that the formation constant Kf is [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]) and is equal to 5e10. Because when the complex forms, Kf is large, so the complex is stable.\n\nWait, but the problem states K_Ca-EDTA is 5e10. I think K_Ca-EDTA refers to the formation constant Kf. So in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we can assume that the dissociation is minimal because Kf is so large.\n\nSo, let's model the dissociation. Let me set up the equilibrium.\n\nAt initial, before dissociation, the concentration of CaY\u00b2\u2212 is 0.02 M. The concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212 are both 0, but that can't be right because the complex can't be 100% dissociated. Wait, no, because Kf is huge, the dissociation is minimal. So we can approximate that the change is negligible.\n\nLet me denote the change in concentration of Ca\u00b2+ as x. So, at equilibrium:\n\n[CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 M (since x is very small)\n\n[Ca\u00b2+] = x\n\n[Y^4\u2212] = x (since each mole of dissociation gives one mole of each)\n\nSo the expression for Kf is:\n\nKf = [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]) = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x\u00b2\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no, Kf is the formation constant, which is [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]). So, plugging in the numbers:\n\n5e10 = (0.02) / (x\u00b2)\n\nSo solving for x:\n\nx\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 2/(5e13) = 4e-15? Wait, no. Let me compute that step by step.\n\n0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.\n\nWait, wait, no. 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x\u00b2 = 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no. 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 10^-13 is 10^-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.\n\nWait, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca\u00b2+] is about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So Kf is 5e10, which is a very large number, so the dissociation is minimal. So our assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 holds true. So x is about 6.3e-7, which is option C.\n",

The temperature is 25\u00b0C, which is standard, so I don't think it affects the calculations here. The given equilibrium constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.\n\nHmm, okay.

So Kf = 5e10.\n\nWait, but for the dissociation, the reverse reaction, the K would be 1/Kf. Because when you reverse the reaction, the K becomes the reciprocal.

We need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.\n\nLet me think about the dissociation of the complex. The reaction can be written as:\n\nCaEDTA^2\u2212 \u21cc Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4\u2212\n\nThe equilibrium expression for this reaction would be K = [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212] / [CaEDTA^2\u2212]\n\nWait, but in this case, K is given as K_Ca-EDTA, which I think is the formation constant, Kf. Wait no, wait. Formation constant Kf is for the formation of the complex. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212]).\n\nBut the problem gives K_Ca-EDTA as 5e10. So Kf = 5e10.\n\nWait, but for the dissociation, the reverse reaction, the K would be 1/Kf. Because when you reverse the reaction, the K becomes the reciprocal. So the dissociation of CaEDTA^2\u2212 would have a K = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.\n\nSo, the dissociation reaction is:\n\nCaEDTA^2\u2212 \u21cc Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4\u2212\n\nThe K for this is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.\n\nNow, in the solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ that dissociates from the complex. So at equilibrium, the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is x, the concentration of EDTA^4\u2212 is x, and the concentration of the complex is 0.02 - x.\n\nBut wait, since K is very small (2e-11), which is a very small number, that suggests that the dissociation is minimal. So x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\nK \u2248 (x)(x) / 0.02 = x\u00b2 / 0.02\n\nWe know K is 2e-11, so:\n\nx\u00b2 / 0.02 = 2e-11\nx\u00b2 = 0.02 * 2e-11\nx\u00b2 = 4e-13\nx = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, let me calculate that again.\n\nWait, sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7 approximately. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The K for the dissociation is 1/Kf. Kf is 5e10, so 1/Kf is 2e-11. So the approach is correct.\n\nAlso, since K is so small, the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 is valid because x is about 6e-7, which is way smaller than 0.02. So the approximation holds.\n\nSo the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we analyze the dissociation equilibrium:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \\leftrightharpoons \\text{Ca}^{2+} + \\text{EDTA}^{4-}\n\\]\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation is:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}.\n\\]\n\nLet the concentration of calcium ions at equilibrium be \\( x \\). Since the dissociation is minimal (due to the small \\( K \\)), we approximate the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as remaining nearly constant at 0.02 M. The equilibrium expression becomes:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( K = 2 \\times 10^{-11} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 0.02 \\times 2 \\times 10^{-11} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}.\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \\( 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M} \\), which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",
