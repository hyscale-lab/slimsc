      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem gives me a Hamiltonian operator H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, where \u03c3 is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and \u03b5 is an energy constant. I need to find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.\n\nHmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z, each of which is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 = 1.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix then. Now, eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix can be found using the characteristic equation, but wait, maybe there's a simpler way here because of the structure of the Pauli matrices.\n\nI recall that for any unit vector n, the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues \u00b11. Because \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a spin operator in the direction of n, and spin-\u00bd particles have eigenvalues \u00b1\u210f/2 when multiplied by the Pauli matrices. Wait, no, let me think again. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues \u00b11, but when you multiply them by a scalar, like \u03b5, does that change the eigenvalues?\n\nWait, the Pauli matrices \u03c3_i each have eigenvalues +1 and -1. So if I have \u03c3 \u00b7 n, which is a sum of the Pauli matrices multiplied by components of n, which is a unit vector, then the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n would still be \u00b11, right? Because each term contributes in a way that the overall magnitude is the same as the eigenvalue of each Pauli matrix.\n\nWait, but actually, \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a matrix whose trace is zero (since each \u03c3_i has trace zero, and n is a unit vector), and its determinant is -1 because each \u03c3_i has determinant -1, but wait, actually, the determinant of \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be (since n is a unit vector) the determinant of (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z). Each Pauli matrix has determinant -1, but when you take a linear combination, the determinant isn't simply the product. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 equals the identity matrix multiplied by 1, because for any unit vector n, \u03c3 \u00b7 n squared is I. Let me verify that.\n\nYes, I remember that (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z)^2. Let's compute this:\n\nEach \u03c3_i squared is the identity matrix (since \u03c3_x^2 = I, same for \u03c3_y and \u03c3_z). The cross terms would be \u03c3_i \u03c3_j where i\u2260j, which are equal to i \u03b5_ijk \u03c3_k, the antisymmetric terms. But when you square \u03c3 \u00b7 n, the cross terms involve \u03c3_i \u03c3_j for i\u2260j. So, let's expand (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2:\n\n= n_x^2 \u03c3_x^2 + n_y^2 \u03c3_y^2 + n_z^2 \u03c3_z^2 + n_x n_y \u03c3_x \u03c3_y + n_x n_z \u03c3_x \u03c3_z + n_y n_x \u03c3_y \u03c3_x + n_y n_z \u03c3_y \u03c3_z + n_z n_x \u03c3_z \u03c3_x + n_z n_y \u03c3_z \u03c3_y.\n\nSince \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = I \u03b4_ij + i \u03b5_ijk \u03c3_k. Wait, but for i\u2260j, \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = i \u03b5_ijk \u03c3_k (the sum over k). But when you sum all these cross terms, each pair contributes terms that are antisymmetric, like \u03c3_x \u03c3_y = i \u03c3_z, and \u03c3_y \u03c3_x = -i \u03c3_z. So, when you have n_x n_y \u03c3_x \u03c3_y + n_x n_y \u03c3_y \u03c3_x, that would be n_x n_y (i \u03c3_z) + n_x n_y (-i \u03c3_z) )= 0. So all the cross terms cancel out. The remaining terms are n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 times I, and since n is a unit vector, this sum is 1. Therefore, (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = I. So the square of the operator is identity, which implies that the eigenvalues squared are 1, so the eigenvalues must be +1 and -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n are +1 and -1. Now, the Hamiltonian H is \u03b5 times \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So the eigenvalues of H would be \u03b5 multiplied by each eigenvalue of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. That would make them \u03b5 * 1 = \u03b5 and \u03b5 * (-1) = -\u03b5. So the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is \"+\u03b5, -\u03b5\". Option C is \"+\u03b5 \u210f/2, -\u03b5 \u210f/2\". Why is that? Did I miss something about the Pauli matrices?\n\nOh wait a second! The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \u00b11, but when you have an operator like \u03c3 \u00b7 n, it's scaled. Wait, no, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues \u00b11. So when you have \u03c3 \u00b7 n, the eigenvalues are \u00b11. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operator is usually (\u03c3 \u00b7 n) multiplied by \u210f/2. Because the spin angular momentum S is (\u210f/2) \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So the eigenvalues of S would be \u00b1 \u210f/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, so the eigenvalues are \u03b5 times the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n, which are \u00b11. So H has eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nWait, but what about the actual dimension of the problem? Because the Pauli matrices are dimensionless, right? Because \u03c3 is in units of inverse energy, perhaps. Wait, the Hamiltonian has units of energy. \u03b5 is given as an energy constant. So H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n would have units of energy multiplied by a dimensionless quantity (since \u03c3 is dimensionless, as it's a matrix operator). So the eigenvalues would indeed be \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is \"+\u03b5, -\u03b5\". Option C is \"+\u03b5 \u210f/2, -\u03b5 \u210f/2\". So the correct eigenvalues would be \u00b1\u03b5, which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, and when you have \u03c3 \u00b7 n, its trace is zero. The determinant is -1, as each Pauli matrix has determinant -1. So, the eigenvalues must be +1 and -1, because the trace is zero (1 + (-1) = 0), and the determinant is (1)(-1) = -1, which matches. So \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues \u00b11.\n\nSo H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n would have eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5. Therefore, option B is correct.\n\nAnother approach: The eigenvalues of any matrix A are the roots of det(A - \u03bb I) =0. So for H= \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, which is a 2x2 matrix. The trace is zero (since each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector), so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The determinant of H is [\u03b5]^2 * det(\u03c3 \u00b7 n). The determinant of \u03c3 \u00b7 n is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z) squared? Wait, earlier I found that (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = I, so the determinant of (\u03c3 \u00b7 n) is the determinant of I, which is 1. But wait, no, wait. (\u03c3 \u00b7 n) squared is I, so (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = I. So, taking determinant on both sides: det( (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 ) = det(I) =1. The left side is [det(\u03c3 \u00b7 n)]^2 = 1. So det(\u03c3 \u00b7 n) is either +1 or -1. But wait, \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a traceless matrix (trace is zero), so its eigenvalues are +1 and -1. The determinant is the product of eigenvalues, which is (1)(-1) = -1. So det(\u03c3 \u00b7 n) = -1.\n\nSo for H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, the determinant is \u03b5^2 * det(\u03c3 \u00b7n )= \u03b5^2 * (-1) = -\u03b5^2. The trace of H is zero because \u03c3 \u00b7n has trace zero. So the characteristic equation is \u03bb^2 - Tr(H) \u03bb + det(H) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb^2 - 0 \u03bb - \u03b5^2 =0 \u2192 \u03bb^2 = \u03b5^2 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b1\u03b5. Yep, same result.\n",

Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe question says: We have a system with a Hamiltonian operator H equal to \u03b5 times the dot product of \u03c3 (the Pauli spin matrices) and n, where n is an arbitrary unit vector. We need to find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.\n\nHmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z, and each is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product here would mean \u03c3 \u00b7 n = \u03c3_x n_x + \u03c3_y n_y + \u03c3_z n_z. Oh wait, right, because n is a unit vector, the sum of the squares of its components should be 1. So n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 = 1.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n). I think I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix... I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(H - \u03bbI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and \u03bb represents the eigenvalues.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a smarter way to do this without getting into the matrix components. I remember that Pauli matrices have some properties. Each Pauli matrix, when squared, gives the identity matrix multiplied by something. Like \u03c3_x squared is I, same for \u03c3_y and \u03c3_z. Also, \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a vector in the direction of n, so maybe it's a spin operator in that direction.\n\nOh right! The spin operator in an arbitrary direction. The eigenvalues of the spin component in any direction are \u00b1 \u0127/2 for spin-\u00bd particles. Wait, but wait, in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n). So the eigenvalues would be based on that.\n\nWait, let me think again. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless because their components are 2x2 matrices with entries like 1, 0, etc. But wait, \u03b5 is given as a constant with the dimension of energy. So when I multiply \u03b5 by \u03c3 \u00b7 n, the units should make sense for H, which is an energy operator.\n\nWait, but each Pauli matrix (\u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z) is dimensionless because they are matrices of 0s and 1s (or \u00b11s). So \u03c3 \u00b7 n is dimensionless, so H would have the same dimension as \u03b5, which is energy. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. I think that for any unit vector n, the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues \u00b11. Because each Pauli matrix, when squared, gives the identity matrix, so the eigenvalues are either +1 or -1. So \u03c3 \u00b7 n would have eigenvalues \u00b11 because it's a spin-\u00bd system.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think about this. The spin operator is usually represented as S = (\u0127/2) \u03c3. So the eigenvalues of S \u00b7 n would be \u00b1 \u0127/2. But in our case, the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n). So H is \u03b5 times the Pauli matrices' dot product with n. So the eigenvalues of H would be \u03b5 multiplied by the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n.\n\nIf \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues \u00b11, then H would have eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5. So the eigenvalues are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption B says +\u03b5 and -\u03b5, so that's looking right. Option C is plus and minus \u03b5 \u0127/2. Why would that be the case? Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the spin operator with the Pauli matrices. Because S = (\u0127/2) \u03c3, so the eigenvalues of S \u00b7 n are (\u0127/2)(+1) and (\u0127/2)(-1), which are \u00b1 \u0127/2. But in our problem, the Hamiltonian is \u03b5 times \u03c3 \u00b7 n, so H's eigenvalues would be \u03b5 times the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n, which are \u00b11. So H's eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nWait, but what if the problem is considering the spin operator? Because sometimes the Pauli matrices are written with a factor of \u0127/2. Let me think about that again. The spin operator S is (\u0127/2) \u03c3, so S \u00b7 n would have eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. But in the problem, the Hamiltonian is \u03b5 times \u03c3 \u00b7 n, not S \u00b7 n. So H is \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n), which is \u03b5 multiplied by a dimensionless quantity, so the eigenvalues would be \u00b1\u03b5. So option B is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose I have a spin-\u00bd particle in a magnetic field pointing in direction n. The Hamiltonian would be proportional to \u03c3 \u00b7 n, and the energy levels would be \u00b1 (something). So for a spin in a magnetic field, the energy is proportional to the spin component in that direction. So if the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b3 S \u00b7 B, where \u03b3 is some gyromagnetic ratio, then the eigenvalues are \u00b1 (\u03b3 \u0127/2). But in this problem, H is \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n), and I think \u03c3 is the Pauli matrices, which for spin-\u00bd, S = (\u0127/2) \u03c3. So if H is \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n) = 2\u03b5 (S \u00b7 n) / \u0127. Hmm, that's getting a bit more complicated. Wait, let me try to express H in terms of S.\n\nH = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n) = \u03b5 * (2 S \u00b7 n) / (\u0127/2) )? Wait, no. Let me clarify. The Pauli matrices are related to the spin operator by S = (\u0127/2) \u03c3. So \u03c3 \u00b7 n = (2 S \u00b7 n) / \u0127. So H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n) = \u03b5 * (2 S \u00b7 n) / \u0127. \n\nBut S \u00b7 n has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So H would be \u03b5 * (2 * (\u00b1 \u0127/2 )) / \u0127 ) = \u03b5 * ( ( \u00b1 \u0127 ) / \u0127 ) ) = \u03b5 * ( \u00b1 1 ). So the eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u03b5. So that brings me back to option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the matrix. Let's say n is along the z-axis. Then \u03c3 \u00b7 n is \u03c3_z. The matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So H would be \u03b5 times that matrix, so eigenvalues are \u03b5 and -\u03b5. So in that case, the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5, which is option B. So that makes sense.\n\nBut wait, what if n is not along z? Would that affect the eigenvalues? No, because the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n are always \u00b11, regardless of the direction of n. Because \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a Hermitian matrix, and its square is (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z)^2. Let's compute that: each \u03c3_i squared is I, and the cross terms involve anticommutators. But (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I + 2 n_x n_y {\u03c3_x, \u03c3_y} + 2 n_x n_z {\u03c3_x, \u03c3_z} + 2 n_y n_z {\u03c3_y, \u03c3_z}.\n\nBut since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 =1. The anticommutators {\u03c3_i, \u03c3_j} = 2 \u03b4_ij I. So each term like {\u03c3_x, \u03c3_y} is 2 I if i=j, but for i\u2260j, it's zero. So the cross terms would be 2 n_x n_y (2 I) \u03b4_xy? Wait, no. Wait, the anticommutator {\u03c3_x, \u03c3_y} is 0, because \u03c3_x and \u03c3_y anticommute. Wait, no, wait: {\u03c3_i, \u03c3_j} = 2 \u03b4_ij I. Because \u03c3_i and \u03c3_j anticommute when i\u2260j. So when i\u2260j, {\u03c3_i, \u03c3_j} =0. So when i=j, it's 2 I.\n\nSo (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I + 0 + 0 + 0 = I. Because n is a unit vector, so that sum is 1. Therefore, (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = I. So the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n must satisfy \u03bb^2 = 1, so \u03bb=\u00b11. So yes, the eigenvalues are \u00b11, and so H has eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5. So the correct option is B.\n",

Because \u03c3_i and \u03c3_j anticommute when i\u2260j. So when i\u2260j, {\u03c3_i, \u03c3_j} =0. So when i=j, it's 2 I.\n\nSo (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I + 0 + 0 + 0 = I.

I need to find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.\n\nHmm, Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z, each of which are 2x2 matrices. The dot product \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z. So H is a 2x2 matrix, and I need to find its eigenvalues.\n\nWait, eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix can be found using the characteristic equation, which is det(H - \u03bbI) = 0. But maybe there's a simpler way here. Oh, right! The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues \u00b11. But wait, here H is a combination of them multiplied by \u03b5 and a unit vector.\n\nWait, let's think about the magnitude. The operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a sum of the Pauli matrices multiplied by the components of n. Since n is a unit vector, the sum is like a direction. But each Pauli matrix has trace zero and determinant -1. Wait, no, the determinant of each Pauli matrix is -1? Let me think. For \u03c3_x, for example, it's [[0,1],[1,0]], so determinant is (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1. Same for \u03c3_y and \u03c3_z. So each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11, and their trace is zero.\n\nBut the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a vector in the direction of n. So the matrix \u03c3 \u00b7 n has some properties. Wait, what's the trace of \u03c3 \u00b7 n? It should be zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector, so the sum would have trace zero. The determinant would be... Well, for a 2x2 matrix, determinant is (trace)^2 /4 - ... Wait, no, that's for Pauli matrices. Wait, for a general matrix A, det(A) = (trace A)^2 /4 - (trace A^2)/4? No, that's for Pauli matrices. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. Since \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a Hermitian operator (because Pauli matrices are Hermitian and n is real), the eigenvalues should be real.\n\nThe eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be the same as the eigenvalues of any spin component in a particular direction. Oh wait, the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n should be \u00b11, right? Because for any direction, the spin-up and spin-down states have eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because \u03c3 \u00b7 n acting on a spin-up state gives +1, spin-down gives -1. So H is \u03b5 times \u03c3 \u00b7 n, so the eigenvalues would be \u03b5 times those, so \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think about the matrix. Let me take a specific example. Suppose n is along the z-axis, so n = (0,0,1). Then \u03c3 \u00b7 n = \u03c3_z, which is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The eigenvalues are 1 and -1, so H would be \u03b5 \u03c3_z, eigenvalues \u03b5 and -\u03b5. So that's the case when n is along z.\n\nBut n is arbitrary. So regardless of the direction of n, the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be \u00b11. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \u00b11 regardless of their orientation. So scaling by \u03b5 would give eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03b5 and -\u03b5. Looking at the options, option B is +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but I remember sometimes when you have an operator like \u03c3 \u00b7 n, the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u0127/2, but that's when you're considering spin operators, like S = (\u0127/2) \u03c3. So in that case, the Hamiltonian would be something like (\u03b5/2) \u0127 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, leading to eigenvalues \u00b1 \u03b5 \u0127/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, so the eigenvalues would be \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nWait, the problem says that \u03b5 is a constant of dimension energy. So perhaps the Pauli matrices are being used directly, without the 1/2 factor. Because sometimes in spin systems, S = (\u0127/2) \u03c3, so the spin component is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix. But in this question, H is \u03b5 multiplied by \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So no, the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nSo the correct option is B.\n",

Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian is an operator that represents the total energy of a system. Its eigenvalues correspond to the possible energy levels that the system can have.\n\nThe given Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, where \u03c3 is the vector of Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z. So the dot product \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be \u03c3_x n_x + \u03c3_y n_y + \u03c3_z n_z. \n\nWait, what do the Pauli matrices look like again? Oh yeah, each of them is a 2x2 matrix. For example, \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. \n\nBut wait, in this case, we're taking the dot product of \u03c3 and n. So H becomes a matrix where each component is scaled by the corresponding component of n. Since n is a unit vector, the sum of squares of its components is 1. So n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 = 1.\n\nI need to find the eigenvalues of H. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, and the determinant is ad - bc for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[c, d]]. \n\nBut wait, I remember that for any 2x2 matrix M, the eigenvalues are (trace(M) \u00b1 sqrt(trace(M)^2 - 4 determinant(M)))/2. Alternatively, for a Pauli matrix term, maybe there's a simpler way. Oh right, because the Pauli matrices are traceless (trace of \u03c3_i is zero for each i), but when you multiply by \u03b5 and take the dot product with n, does the trace change?\n\nWait, let me write H as \u03b5 (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z). Each \u03c3 matrix has a trace of zero. So the trace of H would be \u03b5 times (n_x trace(\u03c3_x) + n_y trace(\u03c3_y) + n_z trace(\u03c3_z)), which is zero because each trace is zero. So the trace of H is zero.\n\nWhat about the determinant of H? Since H is a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is (H11 H22 - H12 H21). But maybe there's a smarter way. I remember that for any matrix of the form a\u00b7\u03c3, where a is a vector, the eigenvalues are \u00b1|a|. Because the Pauli matrices have the property that (a\u00b7\u03c3)^2 = (a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2) I, where I is the identity matrix. \n\nSo H squared would be (\u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2. Let me compute that. \n\n(\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z)^2. Expanding this, each \u03c3_i squared is I (the identity matrix), and the cross terms are \u03c3_i \u03c3_j + \u03c3_j \u03c3_i. But wait, \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = i \u03b5_{ijk} \u03c3_k, so when i\u2260j, \u03c3_i \u03c3_j + \u03c3_j \u03c3_i = 0. Because the anticommutator {\u03c3_i, \u03c3_j} = 2 \u03b4_{ij} I. So when i\u2260j, the terms cancel out. \n\nSo (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = n_x^2 \u03c3_x^2 + n_y^2 \u03c3_y^2 + n_z^2 \u03c3_z^2 + 0. Each \u03c3_i^2 is I, so this becomes (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. Since n is a unit vector, the sum is 1. So (\u03c3 \u00b7n )^2 = I. \n\nTherefore, H squared is (\u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7n)^2 = \u03b5\u00b2 (\u03c3 \u00b7n )^2 = \u03b5\u00b2 I. \n\nSo H^2 = \u03b5\u00b2 I. Taking the square root, the eigenvalues of H must be the square roots of \u03b5\u00b2, which are \u00b1\u03b5. But wait, because when you take the square root of a matrix, the eigenvalues are the square roots of the original eigenvalues. So if H^2 has eigenvalues \u03b5\u00b2, then H's eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. Suppose H^2 = \u03b5\u00b2 I, then the eigenvalues of H squared are \u03b5\u00b2 and \u03b5\u00b2. So for each eigenvalue \u03bb of H, \u03bb^2 must be \u03b5\u00b2, so \u03bb = \u00b1\u03b5. So yes, the eigenvalues are \u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The Pauli matrices are 2x2, so their trace is zero and determinant is -1 for each (since \u03c3_z is diagonal with 1 and -1, determinant is (1)(-1) - 0 = -1. Wait, but in our case, H is \u03b5 times a vector in the Pauli direction. So H is a 2x2 matrix, and its square is \u03b5\u00b2 I. So the eigenvalues are sqrt(\u03b5\u00b2) and -sqrt(\u03b5\u00b2), which is \u03b5 and -\u03b5. So yeah, eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nSo the correct option is B.\n",

So (\u03c3 \u00b7n )^2 = I. \n\nTherefore, H squared is (\u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7n)^2 = \u03b5\u00b2 (\u03c3 \u00b7n )^2 = \u03b5\u00b2 I. \n\nSo H^2 = \u03b5\u00b2 I. Taking the square root, the eigenvalues of H must be the square roots of \u03b5\u00b2, which are \u00b1\u03b5. But wait, because when you take the square root of a matrix, the eigenvalues are the square roots of the original eigenvalues. So if H^2 has eigenvalues \u03b5\u00b2, then H's eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. Suppose H^2 = \u03b5\u00b2 I, then the eigenvalues of H squared are \u03b5\u00b2 and \u03b5\u00b2. So for each eigenvalue \u03bb of H, \u03bb^2 must be \u03b5\u00b2, so \u03bb = \u00b1\u03b5. So yes, the eigenvalues are \u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. So the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The Pauli matrices are 2x2, so their trace is zero and determinant is -1 for each (since \u03c3_z is diagonal with 1 and -1, determinant is (1)(-1) - 0 = -1. Wait, but in our case, H is \u03b5 times a vector in the Pauli direction. So H is a 2x2 matrix, and its square is \u03b5\u00b2 I. So the eigenvalues are sqrt(\u03b5\u00b2) and -sqrt(\u03b5\u00b2), which is \u03b5 and -\u03b5. So yeah, eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nSo the correct option is B.\n\n\nTo determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \\( H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\), we analyze the structure of \\( H \\). Here, \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, and \\( \\vec{n} \\) is a unit vector. The dot product \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\) expands as \\( n_x \\sigma_x + n_y \\sigma_y + n_z \\sigma_z \\), where \\( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1 \\).\n\nThe eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian of the form \\( H = a \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} \\) (where \\( a \\) is a vector) are known to be \\( \\pm |a| \\). In this case, \\( a = \\varepsilon \\vec{n} \\), so \\( |a| = \\varepsilon \\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \\( H \\) are \\( +\\varepsilon \\) and \\( -\\varepsilon \\).\n\nTo confirm this, we compute \\( H^2 \\). Expanding \\( H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 \\), we use the property of Pauli matrices: \\( (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n} I = I \\), since \\( \\vec{n} \\) is a unit vector. Thus, \\( H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I \\). The eigenvalues of \\( H^2 \\) are \\( \\varepsilon^2 \\), and taking the square root gives the eigenvalues of \\( H \\) as \\( \\pm \\varepsilon \\).\n\nAmong the given options, the correct choice is:\n\n**A)** \\( +1, -1 \\): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues depend on \\( \\varepsilon \\), not a fixed value.  \n**B)** \\( +\\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon \\): Correct, as shown by the analysis.  \n**C)** \\( +\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, -\\varepsilon \\hbar/2 \\): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues do not involve \\( \\hbar \\).  \n**D)** \\( +\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2 \\): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues depend on \\( \\varepsilon \\), not \\( \\hbar \\).\n\nThus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \\( +\\varepsilon \\) and \\( -\\varepsilon \\).\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian represents the energy of a system, and its eigenvalues correspond to the possible energy levels.\n\nThe given Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5\u03c3\u00b7n, where \u03c3 is the vector of Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. Oh right, \u03c3\u00b7n would be the dot product of the Pauli matrices vector with the unit vector n. So \u03c3\u00b7n is like \u03c3_x n_x + \u03c3_y n_y + \u03c3_z n_z. But wait, since n is a unit vector, the direction doesn't matter in terms of the magnitude, only the direction affects the components.\n\nI recall that Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. Each Pauli matrix (\u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when you have \u03c3\u00b7n, which is a linear combination of these matrices, what are its eigenvalues?\n\nWait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their linear combination with real coefficients (since n is a unit vector, the coefficients are real) is also Hermitian. So H is a Hermitian operator, which means its eigenvalues are real.\n\nBut how do I find the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n? Let me think about the properties. Each Pauli matrix has trace zero and determinant -1, but when you take a combination, maybe the trace and determinant can help find eigenvalues.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the magnitude of \u03c3\u00b7n. Since each Pauli matrix squares to identity (\u03c3_i^2 = I for i=x,y,z), the square of \u03c3\u00b7n would be (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2. Let me compute that.\n\n(\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z)^2\n= n_x\u00b2 \u03c3_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 \u03c3_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 \u03c3_z\u00b2 + cross terms.\n\nSince \u03c3_i^2 = I for each i, so each of those terms becomes n_i\u00b2 I. The cross terms involve \u03c3_i \u03c3_j where i\u2260j. I remember that \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = i \u03b5_ijk \u03c3_k, where \u03b5 is the Levi-Civita symbol. Wait, but when you multiply \u03c3_i and \u03c3_j, for i\u2260j, you get i\u03c3_k times something. So when you square \u03c3\u00b7n, the cross terms involve these products.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 more carefully. Let me expand it.\n\n(\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = sum_{i,j} n_i n_j \u03c3_i \u03c3_j.\n\nSince \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = \u03b4_ij I + i \u03b5_ijk \u03c3_k. So the square becomes sum_{i,j} n_i n_j (\u03b4_ij I + i \u03b5_ijk \u03c3_k )\n\n= sum_i (n_i)^2 I + i sum_{i,j,k} \u03b5_ijk n_i n_j \u03c3_k.\n\nThe second term, the sum over i,j,k, is a bit tricky. Let's see. The sum is over i,j,k, and \u03b5_ijk is antisymmetric. Hmm, perhaps the second term can be simplified. Wait, I think that the sum over i,j,k of \u03b5_ijk n_i n_j \u03c3_k is equal to something. Maybe that's related to (n \u00d7 something) but I'm not exactly sure.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach. I remember that (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 has a particular value. Since \u03c3 is a vector of matrices, the square of the operator (\u03c3\u00b7n) would be (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I plus some terms involving \u03c3. But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 =1. So (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = I + something.\n\nAlternatively, I think (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 is equal to I. Wait, let me compute it. Let me pick a specific n for simplicity. Suppose n is along the z-axis, so n_z=1, n_x=n_y=0. Then \u03c3\u00b7n = \u03c3_z. Squaring that gives \u03c3_z^2 = I. So in this case, (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = I.\n\nWait, what if n is arbitrary? Let me take another example. Suppose n is along x. Then \u03c3\u00b7n = \u03c3_x. Its square is I. So in general, (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = I.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for any unit vector n, (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 equals I. Because (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z)^2 = n_x^2 \u03c3_x^2 + ... + cross terms. But each \u03c3_i^2 is I, so sum n_i^2 I = I (since sum n_i^2 =1). The cross terms involve \u03c3_i \u03c3_j, which are anti-commuting. Wait, but for the cross terms, each term would be 2n_i n_j \u03c3_i \u03c3_j, but \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = i \u03b5_ijk \u03c3_k. So when you square \u03c3\u00b7n, the cross terms would involve sums of terms proportional to \u03c3_k. But when you add all cross terms, perhaps their sum is zero because they are orthogonal. Hmm, not entirely sure, but I know that for any n, (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = I.\n\nSo if H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n, then H^2 = \u03b5\u00b2 (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = \u03b5\u00b2 I. So H\u00b2 = \u03b5\u00b2 I. So the eigenvalues of H must satisfy \u03bb\u00b2 = \u03b5\u00b2. Therefore, the eigenvalues are \u03bb = \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nWait, but wait. Because H is a 2x2 matrix, its trace is zero? Because the trace of \u03c3\u00b7n is n_x Tr(\u03c3_x) + n_y Tr(\u03c3_y) + n_z Tr(\u03c3_z). Each Pauli matrix has trace zero, so Tr(H)=0. If the eigenvalues are \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, then \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 =0. And their product is determinant of H.\n\nThe determinant of H would be det(H) = det(\u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n). Since \u03c3\u00b7n is a traceless matrix (as each Pauli matrix is), and for 2x2 matrices, the determinant is (Tr^2 - Tr(A^2))/4? Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, for a 2x2 matrix A, det(A) = (Tr(A)^2 - Tr(A\u00b2))/4. Because Tr(A^2) = (\u03bb1)^2 + (\u03bb2)^2, and Tr(A) = \u03bb1 + \u03bb2. So (Tr(A))^2 = \u03bb1\u00b2 + 2\u03bb1 \u03bb2 + \u03bb2\u00b2. Tr(A^2) is \u03bb1\u00b2 + \u03bb2\u00b2. So determinant is (Tr(A)^2 - Tr(A^2)) / 4 = ( (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2)^2 - (\u03bb1^2 + \u03bb2^2) ) /4 = (2 \u03bb1 \u03bb2 ) /4 = \u03bb1 \u03bb2 /2. So for H, Tr(H)=0, so determinant is (0 - Tr(H\u00b2))/4. But H\u00b2 is \u03b5\u00b2 I, so Tr(H\u00b2) = 2 \u03b5\u00b2 (since trace of I is 2, multiplied by \u03b5\u00b2). So determinant is (0 - 2 \u03b5\u00b2 ) /4 = - \u03b5\u00b2 / 2.\n\nWait, but H is a 2x2 matrix, so the product of eigenvalues is determinant. So \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 = det(H) = - \u03b5\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut earlier, from H\u00b2 = \u03b5\u00b2 I, \u03bb1\u00b2 = \u03b5\u00b2 and \u03bb2\u00b2 = \u03b5\u00b2. So \u03bb1 = \u00b1\u03b5, \u03bb2=\u00b1\u03b5.\n\nBut with the trace zero, \u03bb1 + \u03bb2=0. So the possible eigenvalues are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. Because if one is +\u03b5, the other must be -\u03b5. So their product is -\u03b5\u00b2, which matches the determinant.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B is +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. So the answer should be B.\n",

So for H, Tr(H)=0, so determinant is (0 - Tr(H\u00b2))/4. But H\u00b2 is \u03b5\u00b2 I, so Tr(H\u00b2) = 2 \u03b5\u00b2 (since trace of I is 2, multiplied by \u03b5\u00b2). So determinant is (0 - 2 \u03b5\u00b2 ) /4 = - \u03b5\u00b2 / 2.\n\nWait, but H is a 2x2 matrix, so the product of eigenvalues is determinant. So \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 = det(H) = - \u03b5\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut earlier, from H\u00b2 = \u03b5\u00b2 I, \u03bb1\u00b2 = \u03b5\u00b2 and \u03bb2\u00b2 = \u03b5\u00b2. So \u03bb1 = \u00b1\u03b5, \u03bb2=\u00b1\u03b5.\n\nBut with the trace zero, \u03bb1 + \u03bb2=0. So the possible eigenvalues are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. Because if one is +\u03b5, the other must be -\u03b5. So their product is -\u03b5\u00b2, which matches the determinant.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B is +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. So the answer should be B.\n\n\nTo determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \\( H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\), we start by noting that \\(\\vec{\\sigma}\\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \\(\\vec{n}\\) is a unit vector, and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The operator \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, weighted by the components of \\(\\vec{n}\\).\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Properties of \\(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\):**\n   - The Pauli matrices \\(\\vec{\\sigma}\\) are Hermitian, and their linear combination with real coefficients (since \\(\\vec{n}\\) is a unit vector) is also Hermitian. Thus, \\( H \\) is Hermitian, ensuring real eigenvalues.\n   - The square of \\(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\) is computed as:\n     \\[\n     (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (\\sigma_x n_x + \\sigma_y n_y + \\sigma_z n_z)^2.\n     \\]\n     Expanding this, the cross terms involving \\(\\sigma_i \\sigma_j\\) (for \\(i \\neq j\\)) cancel out due to the properties of the Pauli matrices. The result is:\n     \\[\n     (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = I,\n     \\]\n     where \\(I\\) is the identity matrix. This follows because \\(\\vec{n}\\) is a unit vector, ensuring \\(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1\\).\n\n2. **Eigenvalues of \\(H\\):**\n   - Using \\(H = \\varepsilon (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})\\), we compute:\n     \\[\n     H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I.\n     \\]\n     The eigenvalues of \\(H^2\\) are therefore \\(\\varepsilon^2\\) and \\(-\\varepsilon^2\\), implying the eigenvalues of \\(H\\) are \\(\\pm \\varepsilon\\).\n\n3. **Consistency Check:**\n   - The trace of \\(H\\) is zero because the trace of \\(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\) is zero (each Pauli matrix has a trace of zero). This confirms that the eigenvalues must be \\(\\varepsilon\\) and \\(-\\varepsilon\\), as their sum is zero.\n   - The determinant of \\(H\\) is consistent with the eigenvalues. For a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix, the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, which is \\(-\\varepsilon^2\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \\(H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\) are \\(\\pm \\varepsilon\\). This matches option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Oh right, sigma is the Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. \n\nWait, Pauli matrices... each of them is a 2x2 matrix, right? So sigma is a vector with components sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. And n is a unit vector, so its components must satisfy n_x squared plus n_y squared plus n_z squared equals 1.\n\nThe Hamiltonian H is then epsilon multiplied by the dot product of sigma and n. So that would be H = epsilon (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z). \n\nI remember that when you have a matrix like this, which is a linear combination of Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues can be found using some standard results. Oh right! The eigenvalues of a matrix of the form a\u00b7\u03c3 (where a is a vector) are plus and minus the magnitude of a. But wait, in this case, our a is epsilon times n. Since n is a unit vector, the magnitude of a would be epsilon multiplied by 1, so just epsilon. \n\nWait, let me think again. The Pauli matrices are traceless and have eigenvalues plus and minus 1. So when you have a combination like sigma \u00b7 n, each component is a Pauli matrix scaled by the respective component of n. But since n is a unit vector, the square of (sigma \u00b7 n) would be (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z)^2. Expanding that, I think each term squares to identity because sigma_i squared is I for each i. So it would be n_x\u00b2 I + n_y\u00b2 I + n_z\u00b2 I + cross terms. But cross terms involve sigma_i sigma_j, which are i epsilon terms (the imaginary unit) but when you square the entire thing, the cross terms might vanish because they involve anti-commuting terms. Wait, maybe I should compute the square.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for any vector a, (a \u00b7 sigma) squared is equal to (a \u00b7 a) I. Since a is a vector, (a \u00b7 sigma)^2 = |a|^2 I. So in our case, a is epsilon n. So |a|^2 is (epsilon)^2 (n \u00b7 n) which is epsilon squared times 1, so epsilon squared. \n\nSo (H)^2 would be (epsilon sigma \u00b7 n)^2 = epsilon^2 I. Taking the square root, the eigenvalues of H must be plus and minus epsilon. Because the eigenvalues of H squared are (epsilon)^2 times the eigenvalues of the identity matrix, which are 1. So the square of the eigenvalues of H must be epsilon squared, so the eigenvalues are \u00b1epsilon.\n\nWait, but wait. I should make sure about the scaling. The Hamiltonian is H = epsilon (sigma \u00b7 n). So the eigenvalues are \u00b1epsilon. So looking at the options, option B is +epsilon and -epsilon. Option C has factors of hbar over 2, but I don't think that's the case here. The given H doesn't have any factors of hbar in it because the problem states that epsilon is an energy constant, and the sigma matrices are dimensionless when multiplied by energy units.\n\nWait, wait. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices themselves are dimensionless. So when you have H = epsilon (sigma \u00b7 n), the units make sense because epsilon has units of energy, and the product is an energy times dimensionless terms. So the eigenvalues of H should have units of energy. Looking at the options, option B is correct because it gives eigenvalues with energy units, while option C includes hbar which would add units of angular momentum, but the problem doesn't mention any such factors. \n\nSo the eigenvalues are plus and minus epsilon, which is option B.\n",

Hmm, let's see what the question says.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Oh right, sigma is the vector of Pauli matrices, and n is a unit vector. So the dot product would be sigma_x n_x plus sigma_y n_y plus sigma_z n_z, all multiplied by epsilon.\n\nWait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, right? So each sigma_i is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product would result in another 2x2 matrix. Since n is a unit vector, the sum of the squares of its components is 1. So n_x squared plus n_y squared plus n_z squared equals 1.\n\nI remember that for any Pauli matrix vector, when you take the dot product with a unit vector, the resulting matrix has some specific properties. Oh yeah, the eigenvalues of such a matrix should be plus and minus the magnitude of the vector. But wait, in this case, the vector is scaled by epsilon. So the matrix H would be epsilon times that.\n\nWait, but the Pauli matrices themselves have the property that their trace is zero and their determinant is -1. So each sigma_i squared is the identity matrix. So when I take sigma . n, each component is multiplied by n_i. So (sigma . n)^2 would be sigma_x^2 n_x^2 + sigma_y^2 n_y^2 + sigma_z^2 n_z^2 plus cross terms. But since sigma_i squared is I (identity matrix), each term becomes n_i squared times I. And the cross terms would involve sigma_i sigma_j terms, which are off-diagonal.\n\nBut wait, when I square sigma . n, what happens? Let me think. Let me denote sigma . n as S. Then S squared would be (sigma . n)^2. Let's compute that:\n\nS\u00b2 = (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z)^2.\n\nExpanding this, I get n_x\u00b2 sigma_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 sigma_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 sigma_z\u00b2 + 2 n_x n_y sigma_x sigma_y + 2 n_x n_z sigma_x sigma_z + 2 n_y n_z sigma_y sigma_z.\n\nBut sigma_i squared is I for each i. So the first three terms become n_x\u00b2 I + n_y\u00b2 I + n_z\u00b2 I, which is (n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2) I. Since n is a unit vector, that's 1*I. So the first part is I.\n\nNow the cross terms: I know that sigma_x sigma_y is i sigma_z, sigma_y sigma_z is i sigma_x, and sigma_z sigma_x is i sigma_y. Wait, but I'm not sure about the signs. Let me think: sigma_i sigma_j = i epsilon_ijk sigma_k, where epsilon is the Levi-Civita symbol. So sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z, sigma_y sigma_x = -i sigma_z.\n\nWait, but in S squared, the cross terms are 2 n_x n_y sigma_x sigma_y, which would be 2 n_x n_y (i sigma_z). So each cross term is 2i n_x n_y sigma_z, etc. But wait, I'm trying to compute S\u00b2. Let's write it out:\n\nS\u00b2 = I * (n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2) + 2i (n_x n_y sigma_z + n_x n_z sigma_y + n_y n_z sigma_x).\n\nWait, but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way. Because I know that the square of a Pauli vector is I. Wait, no, wait. The Pauli vector is sigma . n, and its square is (sigma . n)^2.\n\nWait, another approach: the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix vector dot n are plus and minus the magnitude. Since n is a unit vector, the magnitude is 1, so the eigenvalues of sigma . n would be \u00b11. Because the trace is zero, and determinant is -1, so the product of eigenvalues is -1, and their sum is zero. So eigenvalues are +1 and -1.\n\nWait, but wait, that's the eigenvalues of sigma . n. But in our Hamiltonian, we have H = epsilon * (sigma . n). So the eigenvalues would be scaled by epsilon. So the eigenvalues of H would be epsilon * (+1) and epsilon * (-1). So the eigenvalues are plus epsilon and minus epsilon.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is plus epsilon and minus epsilon. Option C is plus epsilon hbar/2 and minus. Hmm, why would there be a hbar factor?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units or constants. Because the Pauli matrices are dimensionless, right? Or wait, no, wait: in quantum mechanics, the spin operators are (hbar/2) sigma. So perhaps when they write sigma . n, it's actually (hbar/2) sigma . n. But in the problem statement, H is given as epsilon sigma . n. So in that case, the eigenvalues would be plus and minus epsilon.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless, so sigma . n is a dimensionless operator. So when multiplied by epsilon (which has dimension of energy), H becomes an energy operator. So the eigenvalues of H would be \u00b1epsilon.\n\nBut wait, in some contexts, the spin operator is S = (hbar/2) sigma, so the eigenvalues of S . n would be \u00b1 hbar/2. So perhaps in that case, the eigenvalues would be \u00b1 epsilon times hbar/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, H is written as epsilon sigma . n. So according to that, the eigenvalues are \u00b1 epsilon. So option B.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm forgetting something. Let me think of the eigenvalues of the spin operator. The spin operator S is (hbar/2) sigma, so S has eigenvalues \u00b1 hbar/2. So if H were epsilon (sigma . n), then H would have eigenvalues \u00b1 epsilon. But wait, no, because sigma is the vector, and S is (hbar/2) sigma. So H = epsilon (sigma . n) = (epsilon / (hbar/2)) * (hbar/2 sigma . n). So that would be (2 epsilon / hbar) * S . n. So the eigenvalues of H would be (2 epsilon / hbar) times the eigenvalues of S . n. And S . n has eigenvalues \u00b1 hbar/2. So H would have eigenvalues \u00b1 (2 epsilon / hbar) * (hbar/2) ) = \u00b1 epsilon.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with what I thought before. So the eigenvalues are \u00b1 epsilon.\n\nBut wait, in the options, option C is \u00b1 epsilon hbar/2. So why would that be the case?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is written differently. Let me read the problem again: H is epsilon times sigma . n. So sigma is the Pauli vector, so H = epsilon (sigma . n). So the eigenvalues of H are the eigenvalues of sigma . n multiplied by epsilon.\n\nAs I thought earlier, sigma . n has eigenvalues \u00b11, so H's eigenvalues are \u00b1 epsilon. So the correct answer is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices, when multiplied by 1/2, give the spin operators. So if the Hamiltonian were epsilon times (1/2) sigma . n, then the eigenvalues would be \u00b1 epsilon/2. But in our case, it's just sigma . n, so without the 1/2 factor.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think about the spin matrices. The spin operator S is given by S = (hbar/2) sigma. So the eigenvalues of S are \u00b1 hbar/2. So if H were proportional to S, then H would have eigenvalues involving hbar/2. But in this problem, H is given as epsilon times sigma . n, not S . n.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem statement is using sigma as the spin matrices multiplied by 2/hbar. No, wait, the problem says sigma are the Pauli spin matrices. So sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z are the standard Pauli matrices. So when you have sigma . n, the eigenvalues are \u00b11. So the Hamiltonian H, which is epsilon times that, would have eigenvalues \u00b1 epsilon.\n\nSo the correct option should be B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again:\n\nOption B: +\u03b5, -\u03b5\n\nOption C: +\u03b5 \u0127/2, -\u03b5 \u0127/2\n\nOption A is \u00b11, which is wrong because the eigenvalues are scaled by \u03b5.\n\nSo the answer must be B.\n",

So sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z, sigma_y sigma_x = -i sigma_z.\n\nWait, but in S squared, the cross terms are 2 n_x n_y sigma_x sigma_y, which would be 2 n_x n_y (i sigma_z). So each cross term is 2i n_x n_y sigma_z, etc. But wait, I'm trying to compute S\u00b2. Let's write it out:\n\nS\u00b2 = I * (n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2) + 2i (n_x n_y sigma_z + n_x n_z sigma_y + n_y n_z sigma_x).\n\nWait, but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way. Because I know that the square of a Pauli vector is I. Wait, no, wait. The Pauli vector is sigma . n, and its square is (sigma . n)^2.\n\nWait, another approach: the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix vector dot n are plus and minus the magnitude. Since n is a unit vector, the magnitude is 1, so the eigenvalues of sigma . n would be \u00b11. Because the trace is zero, and determinant is -1, so the product of eigenvalues is -1, and their sum is zero. So eigenvalues are +1 and -1.\n\nWait, but wait, that's the eigenvalues of sigma . n. But in our Hamiltonian, we have H = epsilon * (sigma . n). So the eigenvalues would be scaled by epsilon. So the eigenvalues of H would be epsilon * (+1) and epsilon * (-1). So the eigenvalues are plus epsilon and minus epsilon.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is plus epsilon and minus epsilon. Option C is plus epsilon hbar/2 and minus. Hmm, why would there be a hbar factor?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units or constants. Because the Pauli matrices are dimensionless, right? Or wait, no, wait: in quantum mechanics, the spin operators are (hbar/2) sigma. So perhaps when they write sigma . n, it's actually (hbar/2) sigma . n. But in the problem statement, H is given as epsilon sigma . n. So in that case, the eigenvalues would be plus and minus epsilon.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless, so sigma . n is a dimensionless operator. So when multiplied by epsilon (which has dimension of energy), H becomes an energy operator. So the eigenvalues of H would be \u00b1epsilon.\n\nBut wait, in some contexts, the spin operator is S = (hbar/2) sigma, so the eigenvalues of S . n would be \u00b1 hbar/2. So perhaps in that case, the eigenvalues would be \u00b1 epsilon times hbar/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, H is written as epsilon sigma . n. So according to that, the eigenvalues are \u00b1 epsilon. So option B.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm forgetting something. Let me think of the eigenvalues of the spin operator. The spin operator S is (hbar/2) sigma, so S has eigenvalues \u00b1 hbar/2. So if H were epsilon (sigma . n), then H would have eigenvalues \u00b1 epsilon. But wait, no, because sigma is the vector, and S is (hbar/2) sigma. So H = epsilon (sigma . n) = (epsilon / (hbar/2)) * (hbar/2 sigma . n). So that would be (2 epsilon / hbar) * S . n. So the eigenvalues of H would be (2 epsilon / hbar) times the eigenvalues of S . n. And S . n has eigenvalues \u00b1 hbar/2. So H would have eigenvalues \u00b1 (2 epsilon / hbar) * (hbar/2) ) = \u00b1 epsilon.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with what I thought before. So the eigenvalues are \u00b1 epsilon.\n\nBut wait, in the options, option C is \u00b1 epsilon hbar/2. So why would that be the case?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is written differently. Let me read the problem again: H is epsilon times sigma . n. So sigma is the Pauli vector, so H = epsilon (sigma . n). So the eigenvalues of H are the eigenvalues of sigma . n multiplied by epsilon.\n\nAs I thought earlier, sigma . n has eigenvalues \u00b11, so H's eigenvalues are \u00b1 epsilon. So the correct answer is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices, when multiplied by 1/2, give the spin operators. So if the Hamiltonian were epsilon times (1/2) sigma . n, then the eigenvalues would be \u00b1 epsilon/2. But in our case, it's just sigma . n, so without the 1/2 factor.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think about the spin matrices. The spin operator S is given by S = (hbar/2) sigma. So the eigenvalues of S are \u00b1 hbar/2. So if H were proportional to S, then H would have eigenvalues involving hbar/2. But in this problem, H is given as epsilon times sigma . n, not S . n.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem statement is using sigma as the spin matrices multiplied by 2/hbar. No, wait, the problem says sigma are the Pauli spin matrices. So sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z are the standard Pauli matrices. So when you have sigma . n, the eigenvalues are \u00b11. So the Hamiltonian H, which is epsilon times that, would have eigenvalues \u00b1 epsilon.\n\nSo the correct option should be B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again:\n\nOption B: +\u03b5, -\u03b5\n\nOption C: +\u03b5 \u0127/2, -\u03b5 \u0127/2\n\nOption A is \u00b11, which is wrong because the eigenvalues are scaled by \u03b5.\n\nSo the answer must be B.\n\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given as \\( H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\), where \\(\\vec{\\sigma}\\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \\(\\vec{n}\\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The goal is to determine the eigenvalues of \\(H\\).\n\nThe Pauli spin matrices \\(\\vec{\\sigma}\\) are 2x2 matrices, and their eigenvalues are \\(\\pm 1\\). The dot product \\(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\) results in a 2x2 matrix whose eigenvalues are \\(\\pm 1\\) because \\(\\vec{n}\\) is a unit vector. When multiplied by \\(\\varepsilon\\), the eigenvalues of \\(H\\) are scaled by \\(\\varepsilon\\), giving eigenvalues of \\(\\pm \\varepsilon\\).\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n- **Option A**: \\(\\pm 1\\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \\(\\varepsilon\\), not \\(\\pm 1\\).\n- **Option B**: \\(\\pm \\varepsilon\\) is correct, as derived above.\n- **Option C**: \\(\\pm \\varepsilon \\hbar/2\\) is incorrect because the Hamiltonian does not include a factor of \\(\\hbar/2\\), which is typically associated with spin operators.\n- **Option D**: \\(\\pm \\hbar/2\\) is incorrect because it does not involve \\(\\varepsilon\\) and is unrelated to the given Hamiltonian.\n\nThus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \\(H\\) are \\(\\pm \\varepsilon\\).\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian gives the energy of a system, and its eigenvalues correspond to possible energy levels.\n\nThe given Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n. Oh wait, \u03c3 is the Pauli vector, right? So \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be the dot product of the Pauli matrices with a unit vector n. Since n is a unit vector, it's like a direction in space.\n\nPauli matrices are \u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03c3z. So \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be n_x \u03c3x + n_y \u03c3y + n_z \u03c3z. But wait, each Pauli matrix is a 2x2 matrix, and when you take their linear combination, the resulting matrix is also 2x2. The Hamiltonian H is then \u03b5 times this matrix.\n\nI need to find the eigenvalues of H. Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving det(H - \u03bbI) = 0, where \u03bb are the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, and the determinant is product minus sum of off-diagonal products.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Since the Pauli matrices have some properties. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11. Because \u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03c3z each square to the identity matrix. So \u03c3\u00b2 = I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\nWait, let me think. The general form is H = \u03b5 (n \u00b7 \u03c3). So n is a unit vector, so n \u00b7 \u03c3 is a vector of components multiplied by each Pauli matrix. Let's denote n \u00b7 \u03c3 as \u03c3\u00b7n, which is a 2x2 matrix.\n\nThe eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n: I think that for any vector n, the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n are \u00b11. Because when you have a spin-\u00bd system, the spin component in the direction of n would have eigenvalues \u00b1\u210f/2, but wait, wait, no\u2014wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues \u00b11. Because, for example, \u03c3x has eigenvalues \u00b11. So when you take a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, what are the eigenvalues?\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because \u03c3\u00b7n is a matrix, but it's a sum of Pauli matrices multiplied by direction cosines. The eigenvalues of such a matrix would depend on the magnitude of the vector. Wait, but since n is a unit vector, the magnitude is 1. So the eigenvalues would be \u00b11? Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11, and when you have a linear combination with coefficients that form a unit vector, the eigenvalues are \u00b11. Because the operator is traceless, and its square is identity.\n\nWait, let me think about this more carefully. The operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2. It would be (n \u00b7 \u03c3)^2. Expanding that, it's n \u00b7 \u03c3 * n \u00b7 \u03c3. Which is n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z multiplied by the same.\n\nUsing the identity for Pauli matrices, \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = \u03b4_ij I + i \u03b5_ijk \u03c3_k. So, when you compute (n \u00b7 \u03c3)^2, you get n_x^2 \u03c3_x^2 + n_y^2 \u03c3_y^2 + n_z^2 \u03c3_z^2 + terms for cross products. Wait, but \u03c3_i^2 = I, so each term like \u03c3_x^2 is I. So sum n_i^2 I = I, because n is a unit vector (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 =1). And the cross terms are for i\u2260j, which would involve i \u03b5 terms. But wait, when you compute (n \u00b7 \u03c3)^2, the cross terms would be 2n_x n_y \u03c3_x \u03c3_y + 2n_x n_z \u03c3_x \u03c3_z + 2n_y n_z \u03c3_y \u03c3_z.\n\nWait, but each \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = I \u03b4_ij + i \u03b5_ijk \u03c3_k. So for i\u2260j, \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = i \u03b5_ijk \u03c3_k. So for each cross term, like \u03c3_x \u03c3_y = i \u03c3_z. So each cross term becomes 2 n_i n_j (i \u03c3_k), where k is such that ijk is cyclic. So putting it all together, (n \u00b7 \u03c3)^2 = I * (n_x^2 + n_y^2 +n_z^2) + i (sum over i<j of 2 n_i n_j \u03c3_k ) ). But since n is a unit vector, the first term is I. The cross terms involve the imaginary unit and the Pauli matrices. But wait, in the end, what's the trace of (n \u00b7 \u03c3)^2? The trace is 2, since I is 2x2 and has trace 2. So (n \u00b7 \u03c3)^2 has eigenvalues each squared, so if \u03bb is an eigenvalue, \u03bb\u00b2 must be 1, because the trace is 2, which is \u03bb1\u00b2 + \u03bb2\u00b2 = 2. If \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are the eigenvalues, then each is either 1 or -1. Because 1\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2 = 2, which matches. So the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n are \u00b11.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n) would be \u03b5 multiplied by \u00b11, so \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is +\u03b5, -\u03b5.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not confusing the Pauli matrices with spin operators. Oh right, because sometimes the spin operator is represented as S = (\u210f/2) \u03c3. So the eigenvalues of S \u00b7 n would be \u00b1\u210f/2. But in this problem, H is \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So if \u03b5 is a constant with energy dimension, then the eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u03b5.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",
