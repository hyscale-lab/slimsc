      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nThe problem says we have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m \u03c9\u00b2 r\u00b2. Hmm, I remember that this is the potential for a harmonic oscillator. Oh right, it's the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator because the potential depends on r squared and it's the same in all directions (isotropic).\n\nThe question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. So I need to figure out the energy level and the degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy) for that level.\n\nWait, in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. The energy levels depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, but since it's isotropic, it's easier to think in terms of the total quantum number n. Oh wait, no, actually in 3D, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Let me think.\n\nIn three dimensions, the potential is separable into x, y, z directions. So each direction behaves like a 1D harmonic oscillator. The energy for each direction is (n + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is the quantum number (n=0,1,2,...). So the total energy in 3D is the sum for each direction: E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, and adding them together gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people denote the total quantum number as N = n_x + n_y + n_z, so E = (N + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nSo, the ground state is when N=0, which gives E = (3/2) \u0127\u03c9. The first excited state would be the next possible N, which is N=1. Then N=2 is the second excited state, and N=3 is the third excited state.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy. So the ground state is N=0, which is the zeroth energy level. The first excited state is N=1, second excited is N=2, third excited is N=3. So the third excited state is N=3.\n\nSo the energy would be (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. Let me compute that: 3 + 3/2 is 4.5, which is 9/2. So the energy is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nNow, the next part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with this energy. That is, the degeneracy of the N=3 level.\n\nIn 3D harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy for a given N is the number of ways you can write N as the sum of three non-negative integers (n_x, n_y, n_z). So for N=3, how many triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) sum to 3?\n\nThis is a combinatorial problem. The number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.\n\nI remember that the formula for the number of solutions is (N + d - 1 choose d - 1), where d is the number of variables. Here, d=3, so it's (3 +3 -1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So 10 possible states.\n\nAlternatively, you can list them. Let's think: n_x can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nCase 1: n_x=0. Then n_y + n_z =3. The number of solutions here is 4 (0+3, 1+2, 2+1, 3+0).\n\nCase 2: n_x=1. Then n_y + n_z =2. Solutions: 3.\n\nCase3: n_x=2. Then n_y + n_z=1. Solutions: 2.\n\nCase4: n_x=3. n_y +n_z=0. Only 1 solution.\n\nTotal:4+3+2+1=10.\n\nSo the degeneracy is 10. So the number of eigenfunctions is 10.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9, 10. That matches. So the correct answer should be option A.\n\nWait, the other options: Option B has the same energy, but the number of eigenfunctions is 10, but the energy expression seems off. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption A: (9/2) \u0127\u03c9, 10. That's correct.\n\nOption C: same energy, but 3 eigenfunctions. No, that's not right. 10 is correct.\n\nSo the answer is option A.\n",

Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe question is about a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = 1/2 m \u03c9\u00b2 r\u00b2. That's like a 3D harmonic oscillator, right? Because Hooke's law is involved, and the potential is quadratic in r.\n\nThe question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue.\n\nHmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. Each state is described by three quantum numbers: n_x, n_y, n_z. Or wait, sometimes people use n, l, m in spherical coordinates, but for the 3D harmonic oscillator, especially in the isotropic case, it's often treated with the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. Oh wait, but sometimes another approach is used where the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers.\n\nWait, let me think. The energy levels in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers: n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Or is it? Alternatively, each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, so the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nYes, that's right. So for each direction, the energy is (n_i + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, so the total is summing all three. So E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nNow, the states are degenerate. The degeneracy depends on the value of n = n_x + n_y + n_z. For a given n, the number of possible states is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2, or something like that. Wait, no, that's for angular momentum. For the 3D harmonic oscillator, the number of states with a given n is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Or maybe it's (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 divided by something? Wait, no, I think it's (n+1)(n+2)/2. Let me think: when n=0, n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. Only one state, so (0+1)(0+2)/2 = 1. Correct. For n=1: possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So three states. Plugging into the formula: (1+1)(1+2)/2 = (2)(3)/2=3. Correct. For n=2: possible combinations are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). So 6 states. The formula gives (2+1)(2+2)/2 = 3*4/2=6. Yep, correct. So the number of states with a particular n is (n+1)(n+2)/2.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, what defines the excited state? The ground state is the lowest energy state. So the ground state has n = 0, E = (0 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nThe first excited state would be n=1, E = (1 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (5/2) \u0127\u03c9. The second excited state is n=2, E=(7/2) \u0127\u03c9. The third excited state is n=3, E=(9/2) \u0127\u03c9. Wait, because excited states are counted starting from the lowest (ground) state. So ground is n=0 (0th state), first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the energy is (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9? Wait, no, E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. So for n=3, E = (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. So the energy is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9, which matches option A and C.\n\nNow, how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for that energy eigenvalue. So the number is the degeneracy, which is the number of states with n=3. So (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2=10. So 10 eigenfunctions. So the energy is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. So looking at the options, option A says (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and 10. Option C says (9/2) \u0127\u03c9, 3. So A is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the counting. Because sometimes the states are counted differently, perhaps using the quantum numbers l and m? No, wait, the 3D harmonic oscillator in Cartesian coordinates uses n_x, n_y, n_z. So the degeneracy is indeed (n+1)(n+2)/2. So for n=3, it's 10. So the correct option is A.\n",

The energy levels of such a system are quantized and given by $E = \\left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are the quantum numbers in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively. The total quantum number is $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, and the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for a given $n$ is $\\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n\nThe ground state corresponds to $n = 0$, with energy $E = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.

Hmm, the question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m \u03c9\u00b2 r\u00b2. Oh right, that's Hooke's law, so this is like a 3D version of a harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe question is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue.\n\nWait, what's the third excited state? Oh, right. In quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. The energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is the total quantum number. But wait, actually, for each dimension (x, y, z), the quantum number can be n_x, n_y, n_z, so the total n is n_x + n_y + n_z. Or is it sometimes called N? Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach. The energy levels are degenerate because different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z can give the same total n. So the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers.

Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=0 (sum of 0+0+0=0). The first excited state is the next energy level, which would correspond to n=1. So the third excited state would be n=3.

The formula for that is (n + 3 -1 choose 3-1) ) = (n+2 choose 2) = (n+2)(n+1)/2.\n\nWait, for n=3, that's (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5*4/2 = 10.

So I need to figure out what the energy levels are in 3D harmonic oscillators.\n\nI recall that in three dimensions, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. But wait, no, in spherical coordinates, it's more about the principal quantum number n and the angular momentum quantum number l. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.\n\nIn 3D harmonic oscillators, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right! The energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.

The 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be solved by considering each direction as a 1D oscillator, and the total energy is the sum of the three. So the energy levels are E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. Each of nx, ny, nz is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...).\n\nSo the possible energy levels are determined by the sum nx + ny + nz.

The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m \u03c9\u00b2 r\u00b2. Right, that's the Hooke's law kind of potential, which makes sense because a harmonic oscillator is involved.\n\nThe question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction.\n\nWait, in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is the total quantum number. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, each direction contributes a quantum number: nx, ny, nz. So the total energy is E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. Or maybe it's (nx + ny + nz + 3) multiplied by something else? Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, for each dimension, the energy is (n + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9. So for 3D, it's summing up the three. So E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. So the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.\n\nNow, the states are degenerate. The degeneracy comes from the different ways to have the same sum of nx + ny + nz. So for each n = nx + ny + nz, the number of states is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 or something like that. Wait, I think it's the number of non-negative integer solutions to nx + ny + nz = n_total, which is (n_total + 2 choose 2) = (n_total + 2)(n_total +1)/2. Or wait, no, maybe it's (n + 2 choose 2) if n is the sum. Let me think.\n\nWait, the sum is nx + ny + nz = N, where N is a non-negative integer. The number of solutions is (N + 2) choose 2, which is (N+2)(N+1)/2. So for example, N=0: 1 state. N=1: 3 states. N=2: 6 states. N=3: 10 states. Oh, right, that rings a bell. So the degeneracy increases as the sum N increases.\n\nNow, the question is about the third excited state. Hmm, excited states are counted starting from the ground state as the lowest energy. The ground state is n=0, so E = (0 +3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (3/2) \u0127\u03c9. The first excited state would be the next possible energy level. Wait, but in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate. So the ground state is the lowest, then the first excited state(s), second, etc.\n\nWait, let's think about the order. The energy levels are E = (N + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where N = nx + ny + nz. So for N=0, E = 3/2 \u0127\u03c9 (ground state). N=1: E=5/2 \u0127\u03c9. N=2: 7/2 \u0127\u03c9. N=3: 9/2 \u0127\u03c9. So the third excited state would be N=3, because the ground state is N=0 (0th level), first excited is N=1 (first level), second excited N=2 (second level), third excited N=3 (third level). So the energy is (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9? Wait, no: E = (N + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. So N=3 gives E = (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = 9/2 \u0127\u03c9. So the energy is 9/2 \u0127\u03c9.\n\nNow, how many eigenfunctions are there for this energy? That's the degeneracy, which is the number of states with N=3. So the number of states is (3 + 2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.\n\nLooking at the options, option A says (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and 10 functions. So that matches.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The third excited state is when N=3. Because the ground state is N=0, first excited N=1, second N=2, third N=3. So yes, E is 9/2 \u0127\u03c9, and degeneracy 10.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: (9/2) \u0127\u03c9, 10 \u2192 correct.\nOption B: Some expression with pi and 1/r\u00b2, which seems off because the energy should be proportional to \u03c9, not 1/r\u00b2.\nOptions C and D have 3 as the number of functions, which doesn't match.\n\nSo the answer should be option A.\n",

I think the energy depends on the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy should depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in x, y, and z directions.\n\nWait, right, in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = \u0127\u03c9(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...).

So the energy levels are quantized and depend on the principal quantum number n, which is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each n corresponds to a specific energy, and each energy level has a certain number of states (eigenfunctions) with the same n.\n\nNow, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, wait. Excited states start counting from the lowest energy. The ground state is the first state, then first excited, second excited, etc. So the third excited state is the fourth state in terms of increasing energy.\n\nBut wait, in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate. Each energy level corresponds to all possible combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z that add up to a particular n. So the ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3.

The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m \u03c9\u00b2 r\u00b2. So, I remember that this is similar to a 3D version of the harmonic oscillator, which I've studied a bit. The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue.\n\nHmm, right. So I think I need to recall how the energy levels work in a 3D harmonic oscillator. In the 3D case, the potential is separable into x, y, and z components, each of which is a 1D harmonic oscillator. So the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction.\n\nIn one dimension, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is the quantum number, starting from 0. So for three dimensions, the total energy would be E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, right? Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, and you add them together.\n\nWait, another way I remember is that the 3D energy levels can be written in terms of a single quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy becomes E = (N + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. That seems right. So each state is characterized by the value of N, which is the sum of the individual quantum numbers in each direction.\n\nNow, the problem is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state? The ground state would be the lowest energy state, which would correspond to N=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z = 0). Then the first excited state would be N=1, the second excited N=2, third excited N=3. Because each time N increases by 1, the energy goes up by \u0127\u03c9.\n\nSo the third excited state is N=3. Therefore, the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. Let me compute that: 3 is 6/2, so 6/2 +3/2 =9/2. So E=(9/2) \u0127\u03c9. That's the first part of the answer.\n\nNow, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy. That is, how many distinct states have N=3? Because each state corresponds to a different combination of n_x, n_y, n_z such that their sum is 3.\n\nSo I need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. Oh, right, this is a combinatorics problem. The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = n is (n + 2) choose 2, which is (n+2)(n+1)/2. So for n=3, it would be (3+2)(3+1)/2 =5*4/2=10. So there are 10 eigenfunctions for N=3.\n\nWait, wait, but wait a second. Another way to think about it: for each N, the degeneracy (number of states) is (N + 2 choose 2) or (N+2)(N+1)/2. So for N=3, it's (5)(4)/2 =10. So that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, let's see:\n\nOption A: (9/2) \u0127\u03c9, 10. That matches what I calculated.\n\nOption C: same energy but 3 eigenfunctions. No, that's not right. Because for N=3, it's 10 states.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me think about the 3D harmonic oscillator again. Each state is determined by (n_x, n_y, n_z), and the energy depends only on their sum N. So each N has a certain number of states. So for N=0, only 1 state. N=1: 3 states (each direction has n=1, others 0). N=2: (2+2 choose 2) =6 states. N=3: 10 states. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the energy is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and 10 eigenfunctions.

I think the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. In 3D, the energy levels are given by E = \u0127\u03c9 (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. Oh wait, but since the oscillator is isotropic, the energy can also be written in terms of the total quantum number n. I think n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So, E = \u0127\u03c9 (n + 3/2).\n\nBut wait, no, the third excited state. Let me think about how excited states work. The ground state is the lowest energy, which would be n = 0 (n_x = n_y = n_z = 0). The first excited state would be the next higher energy level, which would be n=1. So the third excited state would be n=3, right? Because ground is 0, first excited 1, second 2, third 3.\n\nWait, no, sometimes people count the excited states as starting from the first. Hmm.

So, for n=3, how many triples (n_x, n_y, n_z) are there such that n_x + n_y + n_z = 3?\n\nThis is a combinatorics problem.
