      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.\n\nHmm. So, the ratio is n1/n2, right? And when the star has spots, this ratio is lower. So without spots, the ratio is higher. The factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nWait, but what determines the ratio of atoms in two energy levels? Oh, right, the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k T)). Since the problem says the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5, I can find the energy difference.\n\nSo, first, let's calculate the energy difference E between the two levels. The wavelength \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters. The energy E is hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n\nWait, but since we're working in terms of (E2 - E1), which is the energy difference, and in the Boltzmann factor, it's (E2 - E1)/(k T). So, we can compute that term.\n\nLet me write down the constants:\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\nc = 3e8 m/s\nk = Boltzmann constant = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nSo, E = (h c) / \u03bb.\n\nBut since E is in joules, maybe I should compute E/(k T) for each temperature.\n\nWait, for each temperature, T, compute (E)/(k T), then plug into the Boltzmann factor.\n\nWait, but the ratio of the populations is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no. Let me get the formula right.\n\nThe Boltzmann distribution says n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nIn this case, the ratio is n1/n2. So, let's say E1 is the energy of level 1 and E2 is the energy of level 2.\n\nSo, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nAlternatively, if E2 > E1, then E1 - E2 is negative, so the exponent becomes positive.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's think. If E2 is higher than E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive. So, the exponent is positive when E2 > E1.\n\nSo, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )^{-1} ?\n\nWait, let me get this right. The Boltzmann equation is n_j / n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )\n\nSo, if I have n1/n2, that's n_i = n1, n_j = n2.\n\nSo, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, no. Wait, n_j/n_i = (g_j/g_i) exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )\n\nSo, n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( (E_j - E_i)/(k T) )\n\nSo, in this case, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall T_eff is lower, and the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So, the ratio is higher when the star doesn't have spots. So, the factor is higher when T is higher.\n\nWait, because when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp of that increases, so n1/n2 increases. So when the star has higher Teff, the ratio n1/n2 is higher.\n\nSo, when the star has spots, T_eff is 5500 K, and the ratio is lower. Without spots, it's 6000 K, so the ratio is higher.\n\nSo, the ratio without spots is higher than when it has spots. So, the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, (n1/n2)_no_spots > (n1/n2)_spots. So, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nWhich is [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\nWait, but g1 and g2 are the statistical weights for the two levels. If they are the same, then the g1/g2 ratio is 1, and the factor simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )\n\nBecause when you divide, the exponents subtract.\n\nWait, let me do the math:\n\nFactor = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\n= exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) - (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) )\n\n= exp( (E2-E1)/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nSo, if I compute this exponent, I can get the factor.\n\nBut first, I need to compute (E2-E1)/(k T), for each T, but since I'm taking the difference, maybe it's better to compute (E2-E1)/(k) and then multiply by (1/T1 - 1/T2).\n\nWait, but I think it's better to compute (E2-E1) in terms of wavelength.\n\nSo, E2 - E1 = hc/(\u03bb), right? Because the energy of a photon is hc/\u03bb.\n\nWait, but wait. The transition corresponds to a photon emitted when an atom drops from level 2 to level 1. So, the energy of the photon is E2 - E1 = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, (E2 - E1) = hc / \u03bb.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nGiven \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m.\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nSo, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = let me calculate that.\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo, E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately.\n\n1.9878e-25 divided by 1.448e-7.\n\n1.9878 / 1.448 \u2248 1.372.\n\nSo, 1e-25 / 1e-7 is 1e-18.\n\nSo, E \u2248 1.372e-18 J.\n\nNow, k is 1.38e-23 J/K.\n\nSo, (E)/(k) = (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23) \u2248 9.94e4 (about 99,400 K).\n\nWait, because (E)/(k) is (hc/(\u03bb k)) which has units of 1/K, since E is J, k is J/K, so E/k is K.\n\nSo, (E2-E1)/(k) \u2248 99400 K.\n\nSo, now, the term (E2-E1)/(k) is about 99,400 K.\n\nNow, the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhere T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nSo, let's compute 1/T1 - 1/T2.\n\n1/6000 \u2248 1.6667e-4 K^-1\n\n1/5500 \u2248 1.8182e-4 K^-1\n\nSo, 1.8182e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1515e-4 = 1.515e-5 K^-1.\n\nSo, the factor becomes exp( 99400 * 1.515e-5 )\n\nCompute 99400 * 1.515e-5:\n\n99400 * 1.515e-5 = 99400 * 0.00001515.\n\nLet me compute 99400 * 1.515e-5.\n\nWell, 1e5 is 100,000. So, 99400 is almost 1e5, about 0.994 times.\n\nSo, 1e5 * 1.515e-5 = 1.515.\n\nSo, 99400 *1.515e-5 \u2248 0.994 * 1.515 \u2248 1.505.\n\nSo, approximately 1.505.\n\nSo, the exponent is about 1.505.\n\nSo, the factor is exp(1.505) \u2248 ?\n\nWhat's exp(1.5)? e^1.5 is about 4.4817.\n\nWait, let me compute e^1.505.\n\nI know that e^1.6 is about 4.953, e^1.5 is 4.4817, e^1.4 is about 4.055, e^1.3 is about 3.669.\n\nWait, 1.505 is just a bit over 1.5. So, e^1.5 is ~4.4817. Let's compute the exact value.\n\nUsing a calculator (but since I can't, I'll approximate).\n\nLet me think, e^0.005 is approximately 1 + 0.005 + (0.005)^2/2 + ... \u2248 1.0050125.\n\nSo, e^1.505 \u2248 e^1.5 * e^0.005 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.0050125 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.005 \u2248 4.4817 + (4.4817 *0.005) = 4.4817 + 0.0224 \u2248 4.504.\n\nSo, approximately 4.5.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check my calculation.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the exponent calculation.\n\nWait, the factor is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = 99400 K * (1/6000 - 1/5500) K^-1.\n\nWait, let me compute (1/6000 - 1/5500):\n\n1/6000 = 0.000166666...\n1/5500 = 0.000181818...\nSo, 0.000181818... - 0.000166666... = 0.0000151515...\n\nSo, 99400 * 0.0000151515 = ?\n\nLet me compute 99400 * 0.0000151515.\n\nLet me compute 99400 * 0.000015 = 1.491.\n\nAnd 99400 * 0.0000001515 = approximately 99400 * 1.515e-6 \u2248 0.1505.\n\nSo, total is approximately 1.491 + 0.1505 \u2248 1.6415.\n\nWait, that's different from before. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.0000151515 is 1.51515e-5.\n\nSo, 99400 * 1.51515e-5 = 99400 * 1.51515 * 1e-5.\n\nLet me compute 99400 *1.51515:\n\n99400 *1.5 = 149100.\n\n99400 *0.01515 = approx 99400 *0.015 = 1491, plus 99400 *0.00015=14.91. So total is 1491 +14.91=1505.91.\n\nSo, 99400 *1.51515 \u2248 149100 +1505.91= 150605.91.\n\nMultiply by 1e-5: 150605.91e-5 =15.060591.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 99400 *1.51515e-5 is (99400 *1.51515) * 1e-5.\n\nWhich is (approx 150,606) * 1e-5 = 15.0606.\n\nWait, that's about 15.06.\n\nWait, wait, that's a big number. But that would make the exponent 15.06, which is way too high. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, 1/T1 - 1/T2 is positive because T2 is lower than T1. So, 1/6000 - 1/5500 is negative.\n\nWait, wait, wait a second! No, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nWait, the (1/T1 - 1/T2) is (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000 *5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -500/(3.3e7)= approx -1.515e-5 K^-1.\n\nWait, wait, so I think I got the subtraction wrong earlier. Let me redo that.\n\n1/6000 is approximately 0.000166667.\n\n1/5500 is approximately 0.000181818.\n\nSo, 1/6000 - 1/5500 = 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151.\n\nSo, (1/T1 -1/T2)= -1.515e-5 K^-1.\n\nAh, so the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) = 99400 K * (-1.515e-5 K^-1) )= 99400 * (-1.515e-5) = -1.505.\n\nSo, the exponent is -1.505.\n\nSo, the factor is exp( -1.505 ) \u2248 ?\n\nWhat's e^-1.505?\n\ne^-1.5 is approximately 0.2231.\n\nBut wait, let me compute more accurately.\n\ne^(-1.505) = 1/(e^1.505) \u2248 1/4.504 \u2248 0.22198.\n\nSo, the factor is about 0.222.\n\nWait, but wait. The factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ] = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) ) = exp( -1.505 ) \u2248 0.222.\n\nWait, but that's the factor (no spots / spots) of the ratio. So, the ratio without spots is 0.222 times the ratio with spots. Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So, without spots, the ratio is higher. But according to this calculation, without spots, the ratio is 0.222 times the ratio when it has spots. That would mean the ratio is lower when it doesn't have spots, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nHmm. That suggests I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the temperatures. Let me re-express the formula.\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so n1/n2 increases.\n\nSo, when the star has no spots, T is higher (6000 K) than when it has spots (5500 K). So, (n1/n2)_no_spots is higher than (n1/n2)_spots. So, the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots is greater than 1.\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, I got 0.222, which is less than 1. So that's a problem.\n\nAh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent sign.\n\nWait, let's re-express the Boltzmann equation.\n\nn_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nSo, in this case, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nWhich is the same as (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, in the ratio (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2, we have:\n\n[ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ] = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nBut wait, (E2-E1)/(k) is positive, and (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative, since T1 > T2.\n\nSo, the exponent is negative. So, the factor is exp( negative number ), which is less than 1.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio without spots is higher than when it has spots, so the factor should be greater than 1.\n\nHmm. So I'm getting a factor of about 0.222, which is less than 1, but the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher, meaning the factor should be higher than 1.\n\nWhere is the mistake here?\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio in the problem is n2/n1, not n1/n2.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)\".\n\nDoes the ratio mean n1/n2 or n2/n1?\n\nThe problem says that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, when T decreases, the ratio decreases. So, without spots, T is higher, and the ratio is higher.\n\nBut according to my calculation, the ratio n1/n2 is higher when T is higher. So, the factor (n1/n2)_T1/(n1/n2)_T2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( -1.505 )=0.222.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio (n1/n2) is higher when T is higher, which is correct. So, the factor would be (n1/n2)_T1/(n1/n2)_T2 = exp( -1.505 ) = 0.222.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, when T is lower, the ratio is lower. So, the ratio without spots is higher, which is correct.\n\nWait, but the question is: the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.\n\nSo, it's (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.222.\n\nBut the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which means the ratio when no spots is higher, so the factor is larger than 1.\n\nWait, so perhaps I have the ratio backwards. Maybe the ratio is n2/n1.\n\nWait, let me think again. If E2 > E1, then higher temperature would make more atoms in the higher energy level (n2), so n2/n1 would increase.\n\nSo, when T increases, n2/n1 increases.\n\nSo, if the ratio being considered is n2/n1, then when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n2/n1 would be lower.\n\nIn that case, the factor would be (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = exp( (99400)( (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) )\n\nWait, but earlier, I found (1/6000 - 1/5500) is negative, so the exponent becomes negative.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nIf the ratio is n2/n1, then:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, no. Let me rederive.\n\nn2/n1 = [n2/n1] = [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ) ]\n\nSo, when T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp becomes smaller, so n2/n1 decreases.\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is n_i = (g_i / g_total) * exp( -E_i/(k T) )\n\nSo, n2/n1 = [g2 exp( -E2/(k T) ) ] / [g1 exp( -E1/(k T) ) ] = (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nWhich is (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, for E2 > E1, (E2 - E1) positive.\n\nSo, n2/n1 is proportional to exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nThus, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so n2/n1 increases.\n\nWait, no. Because exp( -x ) increases as x decreases. So, if T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative. So, exp(-x) increases when x decreases.\n\nSo, n2/n1 increases when T increases.\n\nSo, for the ratio n2/n1, when T increases, the ratio increases.\n\nSo, when the star has no spots (higher T), n2/n1 is higher, and when it has spots (lower T), n2/n1 is lower.\n\nWhich matches the problem statement: the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the problem refers to the ratio n2/n1 as the ratio that decreases.\n\nWait, but the problem states: \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)\".\n\nHmm, the problem doesn't specify which level comes first. So, if the ratio is n1/n2, then when T increases, n1/n2 increases, which would mean that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. But according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, in that case, the ratio without spots is higher, which aligns with the calculation.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, I found that the factor (n1/n2)_T1/(n1/n2)_T2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) ) )\n\nWhich with T1=6000, T2=5500, gives (1/6000 -1/5500)= negative, so the exponent is negative, so factor is less than 1.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio without spots is higher, so the factor should be greater than 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1, which when T increases, the ratio increases, so the factor (n2/n1)_T1/(n2/n1)_T2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( 99400 * (1/6000 -1/5500) )\n\nWait, but 1/6000 -1/5500 is negative, so the exponent is negative, so the factor is less than 1.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio (n2/n1) increases when T increases. So, when the star has no spots, n2/n1 is higher, so (n2/n1)_T1/(n2/n1)_T2 = factor greater than 1.\n\nHmm, I'm getting myself confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the ratio as (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2.\n\nWhich is [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ] = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )\n\nWhich, as I found earlier, gives a negative exponent, so the factor is less than 1.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio (n1/n2) without spots is higher, so the factor should be greater than 1.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (E2-E1)/(k).\n\nWait, E2-E1 = hc/\u03bb.\n\nWait, let me recompute E/(k).\n\nh=6.626e-34 J.s\nc=3e8 m/s\n\u03bb=1448e-10 m.\n\nE = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.\n\nThen, E/k = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) )= approx 99433 K.\n\nSo, about 99400 K.\n\nSo, (E2-E1)/(k) = 99400 K.\n\nSo, (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) = 99400 * (1/6000 - 1/5500) = 99400 * (-1.515e-5) )= -1.505.\n\nSo, the exponent is -1.505.\n\nSo, the factor is exp(-1.505) \u2248 0.222.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio (n1/n2) is higher when the star doesn't have spots. So, (n1/n2)_T1 is higher than (n1/n2)_T2. So, the factor is (n1/n2)_T1/(n1/n2)_T2 = 0.222, which is less than 1, which would mean (n1/n2)_T1 is lower. That contradicts the problem statement.\n\nSo, where is the error?\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1), not (n1/n2). Let me think about that.\n\nIf the ratio is (n2/n1), then:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nWhich is (g2/g1) exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, the exponent (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes more negative, so exp becomes smaller. So, n2/n1 decreases as T increases.\n\nWait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, this suggests that when T increases, n2/n1 decreases.\n\nBut that can't be right because higher T should populate higher energy levels more.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused again.\n\nWait, let's go back to the basics.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is:\n\nn_i = (g_i / g_total) * exp( - E_i/(k T) )\n\nSo, the ratio n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( (E_j - E_i)/(k T) )\n\nWhich is (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nSo, for E_i > E_j, (E_j - E_i) is negative, so exp( negative ) is a fraction.\n\nSo, if E_i is higher than E_j, n_i is less than n_j, but how much depends on T.\n\nWait, let's say E_i > E_j. So, E_j - E_i is negative.\n\nThus, exp( (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nSo, as T increases, the denominator (k T) increases, making (E_i - E_j)/(k T) smaller. So, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp( -x ) increases as x decreases.\n\nSo, for E_i > E_j, n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nWhich increases as T increases.\n\nBecause as T increases, (E_i - E_j)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent's negative becomes less negative, so exp( -x ) increases.\n\nSo, when T increases, n_i/n_j increases, which makes sense because higher T means more population in higher energy levels.\n\nWait, so if E_i is higher than E_j, then as T increases, the ratio n_i/n_j increases.\n\nSo, in this case, if E2 > E1, then n2/n1 increases with T.\n\nSo, when the star has no spots (higher T), n2/n1 is higher.\n\nSo, according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) decreases.\n\nSo, the ratio without spots is higher.\n\nSo, the factor is (n2/n1)_T1/(n2/n1)_T2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( 99400 * (1/6000 -1/5500) ) = exp( 99400 * ( -1.515e-5 ) )= exp( -1.505 )= 0.222.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. But according to the problem, the ratio (n2/n1) is higher when T is higher, so the factor should be greater than 1.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself more confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the equation for the ratio.\n\nLet me think of the ratio as (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, but E2-E1 is positive, so the exponent becomes smaller, but since it's positive, the exp increases as the exponent increases.\n\nWait, no. Wait, (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive, but as T increases, this term decreases.\n\nSo, when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp of that also decreases. So, (n1/n2) decreases as T increases.\n\nWhich would mean that when the star has no spots (higher T), (n1/n2) is lower. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, implying that (n1/n2) is higher when no spots.\n\nSo, I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck in the weeds here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe key is to find the ratio of (n1/n2) without spots to (n1/n2) with spots.\n\nWe have:\n\n(n1/n2)_T = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, the factor is:\n\nFactor = (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich, as I calculated earlier, is exp( -1.505 ) \u2248 0.222.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, the factor should be (n1/n2)_no_spots/(n1/n2)_spots = (n1/n2)_T1/(n1/n2)_T2 = 0.222.\n\nBut the problem says the ratio decreases, meaning (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots. So, the factor would be greater than 1. But I'm getting 0.222, which is less than 1. So, this can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent.\n\nWait, let's recompute (1/T1 -1/T2).\n\nT1=6000 K, T2=5500 K.\n\n1/T1 = 1/6000 \u2248 0.0001666667\n1/T2 = 1/5500 \u2248 0.0001818182\n\nSo, 1/T1 -1/T2 = 0.0001666667 - 0.0001818182 = -0.0000151515.\n\nSo, (1/T1 -1/T2) = -1.51515e-5 K^-1.\n\nMultiply by (E2-E1)/(k) = 99400 K.\n\nSo, 99400 * (-1.51515e-5 ) = -99400 * 1.51515e-5.\n\nCompute 99400 * 1.51515e-5.\n\n99400 is approximately 1e5, but let me compute exactly.\n\n99400 * 1.51515e-5 = 99400 * 1.51515 * 1e-5.\n\n99400 * 1.51515 = let's compute.\n\n99400 * 1.5 = 149100.\n\n99400 * 0.01515 = 99400 * 0.01 = 994, 99400 *0.005=497, 99400 *0.00015=14.91.\n\nWait, 0.01515 = 0.01 + 0.005 + 0.00015.\n\nSo,\n\n99400 * 0.01 = 994.\n\n99400 * 0.005 = 497.\n\n99400 * 0.00015 = 14.91.\n\nAdding them: 994 +497=1491 +14.91=1505.91.\n\nSo, total is 149100 +1505.91=150605.91.\n\nMultiply by 1e-5: 150605.91e-5 = 15.060591.\n\nBut since the sign is negative, it's -15.060591.\n\nSo, the exponent is -15.06.\n\nSo, factor = exp(-15.06).\n\nWait, exp(-15) is about 3.059e-7. exp(-15.06) is even smaller, about 3e-7.\n\nBut that can't be right because earlier I thought the exponent was about -1.5.\n\nWait, what's happening here? I think I made a mistake in the units.\n\nWait, E2-E1 = hc/\u03bb = 6.626e-34 *3e8 / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = 1.372e-18 J.\n\nThen, (E2-E1)/k = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 99400 K.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, (E2-E1)/(k) is 99400 K.\n\nThen, (1/T1 -1/T2) is -1.51515e-5 K^-1.\n\nMultiply 99400 by -1.51515e-5:\n\n99400 * 1.51515e-5 = (99400 *1.51515) *1e-5.\n\nAs computed earlier, 99400 *1.51515=150605.91.\n\nSo, 150605.91e-5=15.060591.\n\nSo, the exponent is -15.060591.\n\nSo, the factor is exp(-15.060591) \u2248 3.0e-7.\n\nWait, but that's way smaller than 1. So, the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots is 3e-7 times the ratio when it has spots. That would imply that the ratio without spots is much lower, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nI'm clearly making a mistake here. Let me go back to the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the transition corresponds to an absorption line, which would imply that the energy difference is E1 - E2, not E2 - E1.\n\nWait, the transition is between level 1 and level 2. When an atom absorbs a photon, it goes from level 1 to level 2, so the energy of the photon is E2 - E1.\n\nBut when it emits a photon, it goes from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon of energy E2-E1.\n\nSo, the energy difference is E2-E1.\n\nBut perhaps in the Boltzmann equation, I should have used E1-E2, leading to a positive exponent.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the ratio as (n2/n1).\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio being considered is (n2/n1), which would be (g2/g1) * exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) )\n\nBecause n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes more negative, so exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) ) = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) decreases.\n\nSo, n2/n1 decreases as T increases.\n\nWait, but that can't be right, because higher T should lead to more atoms in higher energy levels.\n\nHmm, this is getting too confusing. Perhaps I should think about the Saha equation or consider that the photosphere is in LTE, so the ratio depends on the Boltzmann factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the overall T_eff is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. But the problem says when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, the star's total emitted flux is the sum of the spotted and unspotted regions.\n\nBut perhaps that doesn't affect the calculation of the ratio in the photosphere, because the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio...\", so perhaps the effective temperature is the same across the photosphere, but that can't be the case because part of the surface is cooler.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So, the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K when 40% is spotted.\n\nBut when calculating the ratio in the photosphere, perhaps each region (spot and non-spot) is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), but the observed flux is a combination.\n\nBut the problem says to assume the photosphere is in LTE, so perhaps the entire photosphere is at the same temperature when considering the ratio. Wait, no, when spots are present, part is cooler and part is hotter.\n\nBut the problem says to consider the ratio in the photosphere, which is a mix.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is being measured in the integrated spectrum, so the overall ratio is a combination of the two regions.\n\nBut this complicates things, and I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simplifying it, and when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower, so the ratio is calculated at T=5500 K.\n\nIn that case, the ratio without spots is at 6000 K, and with spots at 5500 K.\n\nSo, the ratio (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 -1/5500) )\n\nWhich we computed earlier as exp( -1.505 ) = 0.222.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio decreases when spots are present, which implies that (n1/n2)_6000 > (n1/n2)_5500, so the factor is greater than 1.\n\nSo, the factor should be (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = 0.222, which is less than 1. So, this suggests that the ratio without spots is lower, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nI think I'm stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio of ionization, but no, it's about neutral Ti atoms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1), which would increase with temperature. So, when T increases, (n2/n1) increases.\n\nSo, without spots, (n2/n1) is higher, so the factor would be (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 -1/5500) ) = exp( -1.505 ) = 0.222, which is less than 1, implying that (n2/n1)_6000 is lower than (n2/n1)_5500, which contradicts.\n\nI'm clearly making a mistake somewhere, but I'm not seeing it. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as I did, and see which option is closest.\n\nThe factor I calculated is about 0.222, which is 1/4.5. So, the reciprocal is about 4.5, which is option C.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio decreases when spots are present, so the factor without spots compared to with spots is higher. So, if the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.222, that's a decrease. But the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present, so the factor would be the inverse.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the ratio. Maybe the factor is (n1/n2)_spots / (n1/n2)_no_spots = 0.222, so the ratio without spots is 1/0.222 \u22484.5 times higher.\n\nSo, the factor is 4.5, which is option C.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C) ~4.5.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \\frac{g_1}{g_2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are the populations of energy levels 1 and 2, \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are their statistical weights, \\(E_2 - E_1\\) is the energy difference, \\(k\\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Energy Difference**: The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \\( \\lambda = 1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5} = 1.448 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m} \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.\n\nHmm. So, the ratio is n1/n2, right? And when the star has spots, this ratio is lower. So without spots, the ratio is higher. The factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nWait, but what determines the ratio of atoms in two energy levels? Oh, right, the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k T)). Since the problem says the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5, I can find the energy difference.\n\nSo, first, let's calculate the energy difference E between the two levels. The wavelength \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters. The energy E is hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n\nWait, but since we're working in terms of (E2 - E1), which is the energy difference, and in the Boltzmann factor, it's (E2 - E1)/(k T). So, we can compute that term.\n\nLet me write down the constants:\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\nc = 3e8 m/s\nk = Boltzmann constant = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nSo, E = (h c) / \u03bb.\n\nBut since E is in joules, maybe I should compute E/(k T) for each temperature.\n\nWait, for each temperature, T, compute (E)/(k T), then plug into the Boltzmann factor.\n\nWait, but the ratio of the populations is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no. Let me get the formula right.\n\nThe Boltzmann distribution says n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nIn this case, the ratio is n1/n2. So, let's say E1 is the energy of level 1 and E2 is the energy of level 2.\n\nSo, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nAlternatively, if E2 > E1, then E1 - E2 is negative, so the exponent becomes positive.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's think. If E2 is higher than E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive. So, the exponent is positive when E2 > E1.\n\nSo, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )^{-1} ?\n\nWait, let me get this right. The Boltzmann equation is n_j / n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )\n\nSo, if I have n1/n2, that's n_i = n1, n_j = n2.\n\nSo, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, no. Wait, n_j/n_i = (g_j/g_i) exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )\n\nSo, n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( (E_j - E_i)/(k T) )\n\nSo, in this case, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall T_eff is lower, and the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So, the ratio is higher when the star doesn't have spots. So, the factor is higher when T is higher.\n\nWait, because when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp of that increases, so n1/n2 increases. So when the star has higher Teff, the ratio n1/n2 is higher.\n\nSo, when the star has spots, T_eff is 5500 K, and the ratio is lower. Without spots, it's 6000 K, so the ratio is higher.\n\nSo, the ratio without spots is higher than when it has spots. So, the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, (n1/n2)_no_spots > (n1/n2)_spots. So, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nWhich is [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\nWait, but g1 and g2 are the statistical weights for the two levels. If they are the same, then the g1/g2 ratio is 1, and the factor simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )\n\nBecause when you divide, the exponents subtract.\n\nWait, let me do the math:\n\nFactor = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\n= exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) - (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) )\n\n= exp( (E2-E1)/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nSo, if I compute this exponent, I can get the factor.\n\nBut first, I need to compute (E2-E1)/(k T), for each T, but since I'm taking the difference, maybe it's better to compute (E2-E1)/(k) and then multiply by (1/T1 - 1/T2).\n\nWait, but I think it's better to compute (E2-E1) in terms of wavelength.\n\nSo, E2 - E1 = hc/(\u03bb), right? Because the energy of a photon is hc/\u03bb.\n\nWait, but wait. The transition corresponds to a photon emitted when an atom drops from level 2 to level 1. So, the energy of the photon is E2 - E1 = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, (E2 - E1) = hc / \u03bb.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nGiven \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m.\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nSo, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = let me calculate that.\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo, E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately.\n\n1.9878e-25 divided by 1.448e-7.\n\n1.9878 / 1.448 \u2248 1.372.\n\nSo, 1e-25 / 1e-7 is 1e-18.\n\nSo, E \u2248 1.372e-18 J.\n\nNow, k is 1.38e-23 J/K.\n\nSo, (E)/(k) = (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23) \u2248 9.94e4 (about 99,400 K).\n\nWait, because (E)/(k) is (hc/(\u03bb k)) which has units of 1/K, since E is J, k is J/K, so E/k is K.\n\nSo, (E2-E1)/(k) \u2248 99400 K.\n\nSo, now, the term (E2-E1)/(k) is about 99,400 K.\n\nNow, the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhere T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nSo, let's compute 1/T1 - 1/T2.\n\n1/6000 \u2248 1.6667e-4 K^-1\n\n1/5500 \u2248 1.8182e-4 K^-1\n\nSo, 1.8182e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1515e-4 = 1.515e-5 K^-1.\n\nSo, the factor becomes exp( 99400 * 1.515e-5 )\n\nCompute 99400 * 1.515e-5:\n\n99400 * 1.515e-5 = 99400 * 0.00001515.\n\nLet me compute 99400 * 1.515e-5.\n\nWell, 1e5 is 100,000. So, 99400 is almost 1e5, about 0.994 times.\n\nSo, 1e5 * 1.515e-5 = 1.515.\n\nSo, 99400 *1.515e-5 \u2248 0.994 * 1.515 \u2248 1.505.\n\nSo, approximately 1.505.\n\nSo, the exponent is about 1.505.\n\nSo, the factor is exp(1.505) \u2248 ?\n\nWhat's exp(1.5)? e^1.5 is about 4.4817.\n\nWait, let me compute e^1.505.\n\nI know that e^1.6 is about 4.953, e^1.5 is 4.4817, e^1.4 is about 4.055, e^1.3 is about 3.669.\n\nWait, 1.505 is just a bit over 1.5. So, e^1.5 is ~4.4817. Let's compute the exact value.\n\nUsing a calculator (but since I can't, I'll approximate).\n\nLet me think, e^0.005 is approximately 1 + 0.005 + (0.005)^2/2 + ... \u2248 1.0050125.\n\nSo, e^1.505 \u2248 e^1.5 * e^0.005 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.0050125 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.005 \u2248 4.4817 + (4.4817 *0.005) = 4.4817 + 0.0224 \u2248 4.504.\n\nSo, approximately 4.5.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check my calculation.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the exponent calculation.\n\nWait, the factor is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = 99400 K * (1/6000 - 1/5500) K^-1.\n\nWait, let me compute (1/6000 - 1/5500):\n\n1/6000 = 0.000166666...\n1/5500 = 0.000181818...\nSo, 0.000181818... - 0.000166666... = 0.0000151515...\n\nSo, 99400 * 0.0000151515 = ?\n\nLet me compute 99400 * 0.0000151515.\n\nLet me compute 99400 * 0.000015 = 1.491.\n\nAnd 99400 * 0.0000001515 = approximately 99400 * 1.515e-6 \u2248 0.1505.\n\nSo, total is approximately 1.491 + 0.1505 \u2248 1.6415.\n\nWait, that's different from before. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.0000151515 is 1.51515e-5.\n\nSo, 99400 * 1.51515e-5 = 99400 * 1.51515 * 1e-5.\n\nLet me compute 99400 *1.51515:\n\n99400 *1.5 = 149100.\n\n99400 *0.01515 = approx 99400 *0.015 = 1491, plus 99400 *0.00015=14.91. So total is 1491 +14.91=1505.91.\n\nSo, 99400 *1.51515 \u2248 149100 +1505.91= 150605.91.\n\nMultiply by 1e-5: 150605.91e-5 =15.060591.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 99400 *1.51515e-5 is (99400 *1.51515) * 1e-5.\n\nWhich is (approx 150,606) * 1e-5 = 15.0606.\n\nWait, that's about 15.06.\n\nWait, wait, that's a big number. But that would make the exponent 15.06, which is way too high. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, 1/T1 - 1/T2 is positive because T2 is lower than T1. So, 1/6000 - 1/5500 is negative.\n\nWait, wait, wait a second! No, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nWait, the (1/T1 - 1/T2) is (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000 *5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -500/(3.3e7)= approx -1.515e-5 K^-1.\n\nWait, wait, so I think I got the subtraction wrong earlier. Let me redo that.\n\n1/6000 is approximately 0.000166667.\n\n1/5500 is approximately 0.000181818.\n\nSo, 1/6000 - 1/5500 = 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151.\n\nSo, (1/T1 -1/T2)= -1.515e-5 K^-1.\n\nAh, so the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) = 99400 K * (-1.515e-5 K^-1) )= 99400 * (-1.515e-5) = -1.505.\n\nSo, the exponent is -1.505.\n\nSo, the factor is exp( -1.505 ) \u2248 ?\n\nWhat's e^-1.505?\n\ne^-1.5 is approximately 0.2231.\n\nBut wait, let me compute more accurately.\n\ne^(-1.505) = 1/(e^1.505) \u2248 1/4.504 \u2248 0.22198.\n\nSo, the factor is about 0.222.\n\nWait, but wait. The factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ] = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) ) = exp( -1.505 ) \u2248 0.222.\n\nWait, but that's the factor (no spots / spots) of the ratio. So, the ratio without spots is 0.222 times the ratio with spots. Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So, without spots, the ratio is higher. But according to this calculation, without spots, the ratio is 0.222 times the ratio when it has spots. That would mean the ratio is lower when it doesn't have spots, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nHmm. That suggests I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the temperatures. Let me re-express the formula.\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so n1/n2 increases.\n\nSo, when the star has no spots, T is higher (6000 K) than when it has spots (5500 K). So, (n1/n2)_no_spots is higher than (n1/n2)_spots. So, the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots is greater than 1.\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, I got 0.222, which is less than 1. So that's a problem.\n\nAh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent sign.\n\nWait, let's re-express the Boltzmann equation.\n\nn_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nSo, in this case, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nWhich is the same as (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, in the ratio (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2, we have:\n\n[ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ] = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nBut wait, (E2-E1)/(k) is positive, and (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative, since T1 > T2.\n\nSo, the exponent is negative. So, the factor is exp( negative number ), which is less than 1.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio without spots is higher than when it has spots, so the factor should be greater than 1.\n\nHmm. So I'm getting a factor of about 0.222, which is less than 1, but the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher, meaning the factor should be higher than 1.\n\nWhere is the mistake here?\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio in the problem is n2/n1, not n1/n2.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)\".\n\nDoes the ratio mean n1/n2 or n2/n1?\n\nThe problem says that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, when T decreases, the ratio decreases. So, without spots, T is higher, and the ratio is higher.\n\nBut according to my calculation, the ratio n1/n2 is higher when T is higher. So, the factor (n1/n2)_T1/(n1/n2)_T2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( -1.505 )=0.222.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio (n1/n2) is higher when T is higher, which is correct. So, the factor would be (n1/n2)_T1/(n1/n2)_T2 = exp( -1.505 ) = 0.222.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, when T is lower, the ratio is lower. So, the ratio without spots is higher, which is correct.\n\nWait, but the question is: the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.\n\nSo, it's (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.222.\n\nBut the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which means the ratio when no spots is higher, so the factor is larger than 1.\n\nWait, so perhaps I have the ratio backwards. Maybe the ratio is n2/n1.\n\nWait, let me think again. If E2 > E1, then higher temperature would make more atoms in the higher energy level (n2), so n2/n1 would increase.\n\nSo, when T increases, n2/n1 increases.\n\nSo, if the ratio being considered is n2/n1, then when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n2/n1 would be lower.\n\nIn that case, the factor would be (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = exp( (99400)( (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) )\n\nWait, but earlier, I found (1/6000 - 1/5500) is negative, so the exponent becomes negative.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nIf the ratio is n2/n1, then:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, no. Let me rederive.\n\nn2/n1 = [n2/n1] = [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ) ]\n\nSo, when T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp becomes smaller, so n2/n1 decreases.\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is n_i = (g_i / g_total) * exp( -E_i/(k T) )\n\nSo, n2/n1 = [g2 exp( -E2/(k T) ) ] / [g1 exp( -E1/(k T) ) ] = (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nWhich is (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, for E2 > E1, (E2 - E1) positive.\n\nSo, n2/n1 is proportional to exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nThus, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so n2/n1 increases.\n\nWait, no. Because exp( -x ) increases as x decreases. So, if T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative. So, exp(-x) increases when x decreases.\n\nSo, n2/n1 increases when T increases.\n\nSo, for the ratio n2/n1, when T increases, the ratio increases.\n\nSo, when the star has no spots (higher T), n2/n1 is higher, and when it has spots (lower T), n2/n1 is lower.\n\nWhich matches the problem statement: the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the problem refers to the ratio n2/n1 as the ratio that decreases.\n\nWait, but the problem states: \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)\".\n\nHmm, the problem doesn't specify which level comes first. So, if the ratio is n1/n2, then when T increases, n1/n2 increases, which would mean that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. But according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, in that case, the ratio without spots is higher, which aligns with the calculation.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, I found that the factor (n1/n2)_T1/(n1/n2)_T2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) ) )\n\nWhich with T1=6000, T2=5500, gives (1/6000 -1/5500)= negative, so the exponent is negative, so factor is less than 1.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio without spots is higher, so the factor should be greater than 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1, which when T increases, the ratio increases, so the factor (n2/n1)_T1/(n2/n1)_T2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( 99400 * (1/6000 -1/5500) )\n\nWait, but 1/6000 -1/5500 is negative, so the exponent is negative, so the factor is less than 1.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio (n2/n1) increases when T increases. So, when the star has no spots, n2/n1 is higher, so (n2/n1)_T1/(n2/n1)_T2 = factor greater than 1.\n\nHmm, I'm getting myself confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the ratio as (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2.\n\nWhich is [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ] = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )\n\nWhich, as I found earlier, gives a negative exponent, so the factor is less than 1.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio (n1/n2) without spots is higher, so the factor should be greater than 1.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (E2-E1)/(k).\n\nWait, E2-E1 = hc/\u03bb.\n\nWait, let me recompute E/(k).\n\nh=6.626e-34 J.s\nc=3e8 m/s\n\u03bb=1448e-10 m.\n\nE = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.\n\nThen, E/k = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) )= approx 99433 K.\n\nSo, about 99400 K.\n\nSo, (E2-E1)/(k) = 99400 K.\n\nSo, (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) = 99400 * (1/6000 - 1/5500) = 99400 * (-1.515e-5) )= -1.505.\n\nSo, the exponent is -1.505.\n\nSo, the factor is exp(-1.505) \u2248 0.222.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio (n1/n2) is higher when the star doesn't have spots. So, (n1/n2)_T1 is higher than (n1/n2)_T2. So, the factor is (n1/n2)_T1/(n1/n2)_T2 = 0.222, which is less than 1, which would mean (n1/n2)_T1 is lower. That contradicts the problem statement.\n\nSo, where is the error?\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1), not (n1/n2). Let me think about that.\n\nIf the ratio is (n2/n1), then:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nWhich is (g2/g1) exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, the exponent (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes more negative, so exp becomes smaller. So, n2/n1 decreases as T increases.\n\nWait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, this suggests that when T increases, n2/n1 decreases.\n\nBut that can't be right because higher T should populate higher energy levels more.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused again.\n\nWait, let's go back to the basics.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is:\n\nn_i = (g_i / g_total) * exp( - E_i/(k T) )\n\nSo, the ratio n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( (E_j - E_i)/(k T) )\n\nWhich is (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nSo, for E_i > E_j, (E_j - E_i) is negative, so exp( negative ) is a fraction.\n\nSo, if E_i is higher than E_j, n_i is less than n_j, but how much depends on T.\n\nWait, let's say E_i > E_j. So, E_j - E_i is negative.\n\nThus, exp( (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nSo, as T increases, the denominator (k T) increases, making (E_i - E_j)/(k T) smaller. So, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp( -x ) increases as x decreases.\n\nSo, for E_i > E_j, n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nWhich increases as T increases.\n\nBecause as T increases, (E_i - E_j)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent's negative becomes less negative, so exp( -x ) increases.\n\nSo, when T increases, n_i/n_j increases, which makes sense because higher T means more population in higher energy levels.\n\nWait, so if E_i is higher than E_j, then as T increases, the ratio n_i/n_j increases.\n\nSo, in this case, if E2 > E1, then n2/n1 increases with T.\n\nSo, when the star has no spots (higher T), n2/n1 is higher.\n\nSo, according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) decreases.\n\nSo, the ratio without spots is higher.\n\nSo, the factor is (n2/n1)_T1/(n2/n1)_T2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( 99400 * (1/6000 -1/5500) ) = exp( 99400 * ( -1.515e-5 ) )= exp( -1.505 )= 0.222.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. But according to the problem, the ratio (n2/n1) is higher when T is higher, so the factor should be greater than 1.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself more confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the equation for the ratio.\n\nLet me think of the ratio as (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, but E2-E1 is positive, so the exponent becomes smaller, but since it's positive, the exp increases as the exponent increases.\n\nWait, no. Wait, (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive, but as T increases, this term decreases.\n\nSo, when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp of that also decreases. So, (n1/n2) decreases as T increases.\n\nWhich would mean that when the star has no spots (higher T), (n1/n2) is lower. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, implying that (n1/n2) is higher when no spots.\n\nSo, I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck in the weeds here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe key is to find the ratio of (n1/n2) without spots to (n1/n2) with spots.\n\nWe have:\n\n(n1/n2)_T = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, the factor is:\n\nFactor = (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich, as I calculated earlier, is exp( -1.505 ) \u2248 0.222.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, the factor should be (n1/n2)_no_spots/(n1/n2)_spots = (n1/n2)_T1/(n1/n2)_T2 = 0.222.\n\nBut the problem says the ratio decreases, meaning (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots. So, the factor would be greater than 1. But I'm getting 0.222, which is less than 1. So, this can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent.\n\nWait, let's recompute (1/T1 -1/T2).\n\nT1=6000 K, T2=5500 K.\n\n1/T1 = 1/6000 \u2248 0.0001666667\n1/T2 = 1/5500 \u2248 0.0001818182\n\nSo, 1/T1 -1/T2 = 0.0001666667 - 0.0001818182 = -0.0000151515.\n\nSo, (1/T1 -1/T2) = -1.51515e-5 K^-1.\n\nMultiply by (E2-E1)/(k) = 99400 K.\n\nSo, 99400 * (-1.51515e-5 ) = -99400 * 1.51515e-5.\n\nCompute 99400 * 1.51515e-5.\n\n99400 is approximately 1e5, but let me compute exactly.\n\n99400 * 1.51515e-5 = 99400 * 1.51515 * 1e-5.\n\n99400 * 1.51515 = let's compute.\n\n99400 * 1.5 = 149100.\n\n99400 * 0.01515 = 99400 * 0.01 = 994, 99400 *0.005=497, 99400 *0.00015=14.91.\n\nWait, 0.01515 = 0.01 + 0.005 + 0.00015.\n\nSo,\n\n99400 * 0.01 = 994.\n\n99400 * 0.005 = 497.\n\n99400 * 0.00015 = 14.91.\n\nAdding them: 994 +497=1491 +14.91=1505.91.\n\nSo, total is 149100 +1505.91=150605.91.\n\nMultiply by 1e-5: 150605.91e-5 = 15.060591.\n\nBut since the sign is negative, it's -15.060591.\n\nSo, the exponent is -15.06.\n\nSo, factor = exp(-15.06).\n\nWait, exp(-15) is about 3.059e-7. exp(-15.06) is even smaller, about 3e-7.\n\nBut that can't be right because earlier I thought the exponent was about -1.5.\n\nWait, what's happening here? I think I made a mistake in the units.\n\nWait, E2-E1 = hc/\u03bb = 6.626e-34 *3e8 / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = 1.372e-18 J.\n\nThen, (E2-E1)/k = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 99400 K.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, (E2-E1)/(k) is 99400 K.\n\nThen, (1/T1 -1/T2) is -1.51515e-5 K^-1.\n\nMultiply 99400 by -1.51515e-5:\n\n99400 * 1.51515e-5 = (99400 *1.51515) *1e-5.\n\nAs computed earlier, 99400 *1.51515=150605.91.\n\nSo, 150605.91e-5=15.060591.\n\nSo, the exponent is -15.060591.\n\nSo, the factor is exp(-15.060591) \u2248 3.0e-7.\n\nWait, but that's way smaller than 1. So, the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots is 3e-7 times the ratio when it has spots. That would imply that the ratio without spots is much lower, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nI'm clearly making a mistake here. Let me go back to the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the transition corresponds to an absorption line, which would imply that the energy difference is E1 - E2, not E2 - E1.\n\nWait, the transition is between level 1 and level 2. When an atom absorbs a photon, it goes from level 1 to level 2, so the energy of the photon is E2 - E1.\n\nBut when it emits a photon, it goes from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon of energy E2-E1.\n\nSo, the energy difference is E2-E1.\n\nBut perhaps in the Boltzmann equation, I should have used E1-E2, leading to a positive exponent.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the ratio as (n2/n1).\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio being considered is (n2/n1), which would be (g2/g1) * exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) )\n\nBecause n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes more negative, so exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) ) = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) decreases.\n\nSo, n2/n1 decreases as T increases.\n\nWait, but that can't be right, because higher T should lead to more atoms in higher energy levels.\n\nHmm, this is getting too confusing. Perhaps I should think about the Saha equation or consider that the photosphere is in LTE, so the ratio depends on the Boltzmann factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the overall T_eff is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. But the problem says when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, the star's total emitted flux is the sum of the spotted and unspotted regions.\n\nBut perhaps that doesn't affect the calculation of the ratio in the photosphere, because the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio...\", so perhaps the effective temperature is the same across the photosphere, but that can't be the case because part of the surface is cooler.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So, the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K when 40% is spotted.\n\nBut when calculating the ratio in the photosphere, perhaps each region (spot and non-spot) is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), but the observed flux is a combination.\n\nBut the problem says to assume the photosphere is in LTE, so perhaps the entire photosphere is at the same temperature when considering the ratio. Wait, no, when spots are present, part is cooler and part is hotter.\n\nBut the problem says to consider the ratio in the photosphere, which is a mix.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is being measured in the integrated spectrum, so the overall ratio is a combination of the two regions.\n\nBut this complicates things, and I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simplifying it, and when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower, so the ratio is calculated at T=5500 K.\n\nIn that case, the ratio without spots is at 6000 K, and with spots at 5500 K.\n\nSo, the ratio (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 -1/5500) )\n\nWhich we computed earlier as exp( -1.505 ) = 0.222.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio decreases when spots are present, which implies that (n1/n2)_6000 > (n1/n2)_5500, so the factor is greater than 1.\n\nSo, the factor should be (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = 0.222, which is less than 1. So, this suggests that the ratio without spots is lower, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nI think I'm stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio of ionization, but no, it's about neutral Ti atoms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1), which would increase with temperature. So, when T increases, (n2/n1) increases.\n\nSo, without spots, (n2/n1) is higher, so the factor would be (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 -1/5500) ) = exp( -1.505 ) = 0.222, which is less than 1, implying that (n2/n1)_6000 is lower than (n2/n1)_5500, which contradicts.\n\nI'm clearly making a mistake somewhere, but I'm not seeing it. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as I did, and see which option is closest.\n\nThe factor I calculated is about 0.222, which is 1/4.5. So, the reciprocal is about 4.5, which is option C.\n\nBut according to the problem, the ratio decreases when spots are present, so the factor without spots compared to with spots is higher. So, if the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.222, that's a decrease. But the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present, so the factor would be the inverse.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the ratio. Maybe the factor is (n1/n2)_spots / (n1/n2)_no_spots = 0.222, so the ratio without spots is 1/0.222 \u22484.5 times higher.\n\nSo, the factor is 4.5, which is option C.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C) ~4.5.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \\frac{g_1}{g_2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are the populations of energy levels 1 and 2, \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are their statistical weights, \\(E_2 - E_1\\) is the energy difference, \\(k\\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Energy Difference**: The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \\( \\lambda = 1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5} = 1.448 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m} \\). Using \\( E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\), where \\( h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s} \\) and \\( c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\), the energy difference is:\n   \\[\n   E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34})(3 \\times 10^8)}{1.448 \\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 1.372 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}.\n   \\]\n   Converting to temperature units using \\( k = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{E}{k} = \\frac{1.372 \\times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23}} \\approx 99400 \\, \\text{K}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Temperature Difference**: The star's temperature without spots is \\( T_1 = 6000 \\, \\text{K} \\), and with spots, \\( T_2 = 5500 \\, \\text{K} \\). The term \\( \\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{6000} - \\frac{1}{5500} = 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 \\approx -1.515 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{K}^{-1}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Exponent Calculation**: The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2} \\right) = (99400)(-1.515 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx -1.505.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Factor Calculation**: The ratio of the populations without spots to with spots is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Factor} = \\exp\\left(-1.505\\right) \\approx 0.222.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Interpretation**: The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning the ratio without spots is higher. Thus, the factor by which the ratio changes is the reciprocal of \\( 0.222 \\), which is approximately \\( 4.5 \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nSo, the problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When the star doesn't have any dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. \n\nThe main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.\n\nHmm. So, the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2, is being observed. The ratio is N1/N2, I think. And this ratio is decreasing when the star has spots. So, when the star is spotted, N1/N2 is lower than when it's not spotted.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes. So, the factor would be (N1/N2)_unspotted divided by (N1/N2)_spotted. Because when the star has spots, the ratio is lower, so the factor should be greater than 1.\n\nThe problem mentions that the transition between these energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 \u00c5. So, that's in the ultraviolet range, I think. Also, the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means we can use the Boltzmann equation for the population of these energy levels.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of the populations of two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the ratio observed is N1/N2. So, when the ratio N1/N2 decreases, that means N2/N1 increases. So, when the star has spots, the temperature is lower. Let me think: when T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller because the denominator is T. So, exp(-\u0394E/(k T)) would be smaller when T is smaller. So, N2/N1 would decrease, which means N1/N2 would increase. But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Hmm, that contradicts my initial thought. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Let me re-express the equation.\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, if E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive. So, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential term increases. So, N2/N1 increases with temperature.\n\nIf the star has spots, the overall T_eff drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. So, when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower. So, the exponent becomes more negative, making the exponential term smaller. So, N2/N1 would decrease, which means that N1/N2 would increase. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. That's confusing. Wait, maybe I got the ratio backwards.\n\nWait, the problem says: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, the ratio N1/N2 is lower when the star has spots. So, when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, N2/N1 is lower, meaning N1/N2 would be higher. That's the opposite of what the problem says. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio being discussed is (N2/N1), but the problem says the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Hmm. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.\" So, it's N1/N2 that decreases when the star has spots.\n\nWait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, N2/N1 decreases, so N1/N2 would increase. So, the ratio N1/N2 should increase when the star has spots. But the problem says the opposite. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which level is higher in energy.\n\nWait, perhaps E2 is lower than E1. Let me think. If level 2 is lower in energy than level 1, then E2 - E1 would be negative. So, -(E2 - E1) would be positive. So, then the exponential would increase as T increases.\n\nWait, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5. I think that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-ultraviolet. The energy difference can be calculated using E = hc/\u03bb. But maybe I don't need that for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about how the ratio depends on temperature. The problem gives two scenarios: one without spots (T=6000 K) and one with spots (T=5500 K). The ratio N1/N2 is observed to decrease when the star has spots, which is when T decreases. So, when T decreases, N1/N2 decreases.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, if level 2 is higher in energy than level 1, then when T decreases, N2/N1 decreases, so N1/N2 increases. So, that contradicts the observation.\n\nHmm, that suggests that perhaps the energy levels are such that level 1 is higher than level 2. Let me think: if E1 > E2, then E2 - E1 is negative, so -(E2 - E1) is positive. So, when T increases, the exponential term increases, so N2/N1 increases. Wait, but in that case, when T increases, N2/N1 would increase, which would mean N1/N2 decreases. So, when the star has spots, T decreases. So, N2/N1 would decrease, making N1/N2 increase. But the problem says that when T is lower (with spots), N1/N2 is lower. So that would only be possible if N2/N1 is increasing when T decreases. Which would imply that level 2 is lower in energy than level 1. Because in that case, when T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller, so N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So, if E2 < E1, E2-E1 is negative. So, the exponent is -(negative)/(k T) = positive/(k T). So, when T decreases, the exponent becomes larger, so exp becomes larger. So N2/N1 would increase as T decreases.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let me assign E2 as the energy of level 2, E1 as the energy of level 1.\n\nIf E2 < E1, then E2 - E1 is negative. So, -(E2 - E1) = E1 - E2, which is positive. So, the exponent is (E1 - E2)/(k T), which is positive. So, when T decreases, the exponent (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes larger, so exp() increases. So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). So, when T decreases, N2/N1 increases. So, when T decreases, N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) would decrease. Which matches the observation. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, in this case, E1 > E2. So, level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. So, the transition corresponds to a photon emitted when an atom drops from level 1 to level 2. That would make sense for an emission line, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nSo, the key point is that when T decreases, N1/N2 decreases. So, the ratio of N1/N2 is inversely proportional to T. Because the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ), which is exp(\u0394E/(k T)), where \u0394E is positive (E1 > E2). So, as T increases, exp(\u0394E/(k T)) decreases, so N1/N2 decreases. But wait, when T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, so N1/N2 decreases. But in our case, when T decreases (with spots), N1/N2 decreases, which would imply that as T decreases, the ratio gets smaller. Wait, but according to the equation, N1/N2 is proportional to exp(\u0394E/(k T)). So, when T decreases, the exponent increases, so N1/N2 increases. But in the problem, N1/N2 decreases when T decreases. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the Saha equation, but no, the Saha equation deals with ionization, not excitation. So, it's the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio for both cases and find the factor.\n\nSo, the ratio N1/N2 is equal to (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ).\n\nWait, wait, let me write the correct form of the Boltzmann equation.\n\nThe Boltzmann distribution says that the number of particles in state i is proportional to g_i * exp( - E_i / (k T) ), where g_i is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of state i.\n\nSo, the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nBecause N1 = g1 exp(-E1/(k T)), N2 = g2 exp(-E2/(k T)), so N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nWhich can also be written as (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), where \u0394E = E1 - E2.\n\nSo, if E1 > E2, then \u0394E is positive, and the exponent becomes negative.\n\nWait, so if E1 > E2, then (E2 - E1) is negative, so -(E1 - E2) is positive. So, the exponent is negative.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just compute the ratio for both temperatures and find the factor.\n\nLet me denote the ratio without spots as R1 and with spots as R2.\n\nR1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T1) )\n\nR2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T2) )\n\nThe factor we're looking for is R1/R2.\n\nSo, R1/R2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2] )\n\nWait, because when you take the ratio, the (g1/g2) terms cancel out.\n\nSo, R1/R2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) )\n\nBut since E2 < E1, (E2 - E1) is negative. Let's compute the exponent.\n\nLet me compute 1/T1 - 1/T2.\n\nT1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\n1/6000 \u2248 0.000166667\n1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818\n\nSo, 1/T1 - 1/T2 = 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151\n\nSo, the exponent becomes (E2 - E1) * ( -0.000015151 ) / (k )\n\nBut since (E2 - E1) is negative (because E2 < E1), the product is positive.\n\nWait, let me compute the exponent:\n\nExponent = (E2 - E1) * (1/(k)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nWhich is (E2 - E1) * ( -0.000015151 ) / k.\n\nBut E2 - E1 is negative, so (E2 - E1) * (-something) would be positive.\n\nSo, the exponent is positive.\n\nSo, R1/R2 = exp( positive number )\n\nWhich means R1/R2 is greater than 1, which aligns with the observation that R1 is higher than R2 because when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.\n\nBut I need to find the numerical value of this factor. To do that, I need to find the energy difference \u0394E = E1 - E2.\n\nThe transition corresponds to a wavelength \u03bb of 1448 \u00c5. So, I can calculate the energy using E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\nc is speed of light, 3e8 m/s\n\u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 m.\n\nSo, E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) \n\nCalculating that:\n\n6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut to convert that to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so:\n\nE (eV) = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nWait, let me compute that again.\n\nE (J) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) \n\nLet me compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo, E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approx 1.372e-18 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So,\n\nE (eV) = 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nWait, 1.372e-18 divided by 1.602e-19 is about 8.56.\n\nSo, E = 8.56 eV.\n\nBut wait, since the transition is from E1 to E2, which is lower in energy, so the energy difference is E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV.\n\nWait, but wait. When an electron transitions from a higher energy level (E1) to a lower (E2), it emits a photon of energy E1 - E2. So, yes, \u0394E = E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV.\n\nSo, now, let's compute the exponent.\n\nExponent = (E2 - E1) * (1/(k) ) * (1/T1 - 1/T2 )\n\nBut (E2 - E1) is -8.56 eV. So, the exponent becomes:\n\n(-8.56 eV) * (1/(k)) * (-0.000015151 )\n\nWait, because (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative, as we calculated before. So, two negatives make a positive.\n\nSo, exponent = (8.56 eV) * 0.000015151 / (k)\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure the units are consistent. Because k is in J/(K), and E is in eV. So, let me convert E from eV to J.\n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo, 8.56 eV = 8.56 * 1.602e-19 J \u2248 1.372e-18 J.\n\nSo, exponent = (1.372e-18 J) * 0.000015151 / (k)\n\nk is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.\n\nSo,\n\nexponent = (1.372e-18 J) * (1.5151e-5) / (1.380649e-23 J/K )\n\nMultiply the numerator terms first:\n\n1.372e-18 * 1.5151e-5 = approx 2.080e-23.\n\nDivide by 1.380649e-23:\n\n2.080e-23 / 1.380649e-23 \u2248 1.509.\n\nSo, the exponent is approximately 1.509.\n\nSo, R1/R2 = exp(1.509) \u2248 e^1.509.\n\nWhat is e^1.509? Let me calculate that.\n\nWe know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817.\n\nLet me compute e^1.509:\n\ne^1.5 is approx 4.4817.\n\n0.009 more: the Taylor series for e^x around x=1.5 is e^1.5 (1 + x -1.5 + (x-1.5)^2/2 + ... )\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute using a calculator approach.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator:\n\ne^1.509 \u2248 4.51 (since 1.509 is close to 1.5, and e^0.009 \u2248 1.00905, so 4.4817 * 1.00905 \u2248 4.52).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact value is about 4.51.\n\nSo, R1/R2 \u2248 4.51.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is the closest.\n\nSo, the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes in the exponents.\n\nWait, when I calculated the exponent:\n\n(\u0394E) * (1/(k)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is (8.56 eV) * (1.5151e-5) / (k in eV/K?)\n\nWait, no, because I converted \u0394E to J already.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used k in eV/(K) to make the units consistent. Let me think.\n\nWait, another approach: express k in eV/K.\n\nk = 8.617333262...e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo, perhaps it's easier to compute everything in eV and K.\n\nSo, E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV.\n\nSo, the exponent is:\n\n(E2 - E1) = -8.56 eV.\n\nSo,\n\nExponent = (-8.56 eV) * [ (1/(6000 K) ) - (1/(5500 K) ) ] / (k )\n\nBut wait, the Boltzmann equation uses (E2 - E1)/(k T), so perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nRatio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, for T1=6000 K, R1 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T1) )\n\nSimilarly, R2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T2) )\n\nSo, R1/R2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ) )\n\nBut E2 - E1 is negative, so let me compute:\n\n(E2 - E1) = -8.56 eV.\n\nSo,\n\n(1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) K^-1 = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 * 5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -5/(330,000) ) = -1/(66,000) ) \u2248 -1.515e-5 K^-1.\n\nSo,\n\nExponent = (E2 - E1) * (1/(k)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2 )\n\nWhich is:\n\n(-8.56 eV) * ( -1.515e-5 K^-1 ) / (k )\n\nBut wait, k is in eV/(K), so when we multiply by 1/(k), it's (1/(k)) which is K/(eV).\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute the exponent in terms of units:\n\n(E2 - E1) is in eV, (1/T1 - 1/T2) is in 1/K, and k is in eV/K.\n\nSo, exponent = [ (E2 - E1) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ] / (k )\n\nWhich is (eV * 1/K ) / (eV/K ) ) \u2192 the eV cancels, K cancels, giving a dimensionless exponent.\n\nSo,\n\nExponent = ( (-8.56 eV) * (-1.515e-5 1/K) ) / (8.617e-5 eV/K )\n\nCompute numerator: (-8.56) * (-1.515e-5) = 8.56 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 let's compute 8 * 1.5e-5 = 1.2e-4, 0.56 * 1.5e-5=8.4e-6. So total is approx 1.284e-4.\n\nDenominator: 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo, exponent = (1.284e-4) / (8.617e-5) \u2248 1.284e-4 / 8.617e-5 \u2248 1.49.\n\nSo, exponent \u2248 1.49.\n\nThen, R1/R2 = exp(1.49) \u2248 e^1.49.\n\nWhat's e^1.49?\n\nWe know that e^1 \u22482.718, e^1.4\u22484.055, e^1.5\u22484.4817. So, 1.49 is just a bit less than 1.5, so e^1.49\u22484.44.\n\nSo, the factor is about 4.44, which is closest to option C, ~4.5.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nSo, the problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When the star doesn't have any dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. \n\nThe main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.\n\nHmm. So, the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2, is being observed. The ratio is N1/N2, I think. And this ratio is decreasing when the star has spots. So, when the star is spotted, N1/N2 is lower than when it's not spotted.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes. So, the factor would be (N1/N2)_unspotted divided by (N1/N2)_spotted. Because when the star has spots, the ratio is lower, so the factor should be greater than 1.\n\nThe problem mentions that the transition between these energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 \u00c5. So, that's in the ultraviolet range, I think. Also, the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means we can use the Boltzmann equation for the population of these energy levels.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of the populations of two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the ratio observed is N1/N2. So, when the ratio N1/N2 decreases, that means N2/N1 increases. So, when the star has spots, the temperature is lower. Let me think: when T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller because the denominator is T. So, exp(-\u0394E/(k T)) would be smaller when T is smaller. So, N2/N1 would decrease, which means N1/N2 would increase. But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Hmm, that contradicts my initial thought. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Let me re-express the equation.\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, if E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive. So, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential term increases. So, N2/N1 increases with temperature.\n\nIf the star has spots, the overall T_eff drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. So, when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower. So, the exponent becomes more negative, making the exponential term smaller. So, N2/N1 would decrease, which means that N1/N2 would increase. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. That's confusing. Wait, maybe I got the ratio backwards.\n\nWait, the problem says: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, the ratio N1/N2 is lower when the star has spots. So, when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, N2/N1 is lower, meaning N1/N2 would be higher. That's the opposite of what the problem says. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio being discussed is (N2/N1), but the problem says the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Hmm. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.\" So, it's N1/N2 that decreases when the star has spots.\n\nWait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, N2/N1 decreases, so N1/N2 would increase. So, the ratio N1/N2 should increase when the star has spots. But the problem says the opposite. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which level is higher in energy.\n\nWait, perhaps E2 is lower than E1. Let me think. If level 2 is lower in energy than level 1, then E2 - E1 would be negative. So, -(E2 - E1) would be positive. So, then the exponential would increase as T increases.\n\nWait, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5. I think that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-ultraviolet. The energy difference can be calculated using E = hc/\u03bb. But maybe I don't need that for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about how the ratio depends on temperature. The problem gives two scenarios: one without spots (T=6000 K) and one with spots (T=5500 K). The ratio N1/N2 is observed to decrease when the star has spots, which is when T decreases. So, when T decreases, N1/N2 decreases.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, if level 2 is higher in energy than level 1, then when T decreases, N2/N1 decreases, so N1/N2 increases. So, that contradicts the observation.\n\nHmm, that suggests that perhaps the energy levels are such that level 1 is higher than level 2. Let me think: if E1 > E2, then E2 - E1 is negative, so -(E2 - E1) is positive. So, when T increases, the exponential term increases, so N2/N1 increases. Wait, but in that case, when T increases, N2/N1 would increase, which would mean N1/N2 decreases. So, when the star has spots, T decreases. So, N2/N1 would decrease, making N1/N2 increase. But the problem says that when T is lower (with spots), N1/N2 is lower. So that would only be possible if N2/N1 is increasing when T decreases. Which would imply that level 2 is lower in energy than level 1. Because in that case, when T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller, so N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So, if E2 < E1, E2-E1 is negative. So, the exponent is -(negative)/(k T) = positive/(k T). So, when T decreases, the exponent becomes larger, so exp becomes larger. So N2/N1 would increase as T decreases.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let me assign E2 as the energy of level 2, E1 as the energy of level 1.\n\nIf E2 < E1, then E2 - E1 is negative. So, -(E2 - E1) = E1 - E2, which is positive. So, the exponent is (E1 - E2)/(k T), which is positive. So, when T decreases, the exponent (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes larger, so exp() increases. So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). So, when T decreases, N2/N1 increases. So, when T decreases, N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) would decrease. Which matches the observation. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, in this case, E1 > E2. So, level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. So, the transition corresponds to a photon emitted when an atom drops from level 1 to level 2. That would make sense for an emission line, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nSo, the key point is that when T decreases, N1/N2 decreases. So, the ratio of N1/N2 is inversely proportional to T. Because the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ), which is exp(\u0394E/(k T)), where \u0394E is positive (E1 > E2). So, as T increases, exp(\u0394E/(k T)) decreases, so N1/N2 decreases. But wait, when T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, so N1/N2 decreases. But in our case, when T decreases (with spots), N1/N2 decreases, which would imply that as T decreases, the ratio gets smaller. Wait, but according to the equation, N1/N2 is proportional to exp(\u0394E/(k T)). So, when T decreases, the exponent increases, so N1/N2 increases. But in the problem, N1/N2 decreases when T decreases. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the Saha equation, but no, the Saha equation deals with ionization, not excitation. So, it's the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio for both cases and find the factor.\n\nSo, the ratio N1/N2 is equal to (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ).\n\nWait, wait, let me write the correct form of the Boltzmann equation.\n\nThe Boltzmann distribution says that the number of particles in state i is proportional to g_i * exp( - E_i / (k T) ), where g_i is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of state i.\n\nSo, the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nBecause N1 = g1 exp(-E1/(k T)), N2 = g2 exp(-E2/(k T)), so N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nWhich can also be written as (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), where \u0394E = E1 - E2.\n\nSo, if E1 > E2, then \u0394E is positive, and the exponent becomes negative.\n\nWait, so if E1 > E2, then (E2 - E1) is negative, so -(E1 - E2) is positive. So, the exponent is negative.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just compute the ratio for both temperatures and find the factor.\n\nLet me denote the ratio without spots as R1 and with spots as R2.\n\nR1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T1) )\n\nR2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T2) )\n\nThe factor we're looking for is R1/R2.\n\nSo, R1/R2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2] )\n\nWait, because when you take the ratio, the (g1/g2) terms cancel out.\n\nSo, R1/R2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) )\n\nBut since E2 < E1, (E2 - E1) is negative. Let's compute the exponent.\n\nLet me compute 1/T1 - 1/T2.\n\nT1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\n1/6000 \u2248 0.000166667\n1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818\n\nSo, 1/T1 - 1/T2 = 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151\n\nSo, the exponent becomes (E2 - E1) * ( -0.000015151 ) / (k )\n\nBut since (E2 - E1) is negative (because E2 < E1), the product is positive.\n\nWait, let me compute the exponent:\n\nExponent = (E2 - E1) * (1/(k)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nWhich is (E2 - E1) * ( -0.000015151 ) / k.\n\nBut E2 - E1 is negative, so (E2 - E1) * (-something) would be positive.\n\nSo, the exponent is positive.\n\nSo, R1/R2 = exp( positive number )\n\nWhich means R1/R2 is greater than 1, which aligns with the observation that R1 is higher than R2 because when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.\n\nBut I need to find the numerical value of this factor. To do that, I need to find the energy difference \u0394E = E1 - E2.\n\nThe transition corresponds to a wavelength \u03bb of 1448 \u00c5. So, I can calculate the energy using E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\nc is speed of light, 3e8 m/s\n\u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 m.\n\nSo, E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) \n\nCalculating that:\n\n6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut to convert that to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so:\n\nE (eV) = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nWait, let me compute that again.\n\nE (J) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) \n\nLet me compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo, E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approx 1.372e-18 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So,\n\nE (eV) = 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nWait, 1.372e-18 divided by 1.602e-19 is about 8.56.\n\nSo, E = 8.56 eV.\n\nBut wait, since the transition is from E1 to E2, which is lower in energy, so the energy difference is E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV.\n\nWait, but wait. When an electron transitions from a higher energy level (E1) to a lower (E2), it emits a photon of energy E1 - E2. So, yes, \u0394E = E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV.\n\nSo, now, let's compute the exponent.\n\nExponent = (E2 - E1) * (1/(k) ) * (1/T1 - 1/T2 )\n\nBut (E2 - E1) is -8.56 eV. So, the exponent becomes:\n\n(-8.56 eV) * (1/(k)) * (-0.000015151 )\n\nWait, because (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative, as we calculated before. So, two negatives make a positive.\n\nSo, exponent = (8.56 eV) * 0.000015151 / (k)\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure the units are consistent. Because k is in J/(K), and E is in eV. So, let me convert E from eV to J.\n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo, 8.56 eV = 8.56 * 1.602e-19 J \u2248 1.372e-18 J.\n\nSo, exponent = (1.372e-18 J) * 0.000015151 / (k)\n\nk is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.\n\nSo,\n\nexponent = (1.372e-18 J) * (1.5151e-5) / (1.380649e-23 J/K )\n\nMultiply the numerator terms first:\n\n1.372e-18 * 1.5151e-5 = approx 2.080e-23.\n\nDivide by 1.380649e-23:\n\n2.080e-23 / 1.380649e-23 \u2248 1.509.\n\nSo, the exponent is approximately 1.509.\n\nSo, R1/R2 = exp(1.509) \u2248 e^1.509.\n\nWhat is e^1.509? Let me calculate that.\n\nWe know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817.\n\nLet me compute e^1.509:\n\ne^1.5 is approx 4.4817.\n\n0.009 more: the Taylor series for e^x around x=1.5 is e^1.5 (1 + x -1.5 + (x-1.5)^2/2 + ... )\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute using a calculator approach.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator:\n\ne^1.509 \u2248 4.51 (since 1.509 is close to 1.5, and e^0.009 \u2248 1.00905, so 4.4817 * 1.00905 \u2248 4.52).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact value is about 4.51.\n\nSo, R1/R2 \u2248 4.51.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is the closest.\n\nSo, the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes in the exponents.\n\nWait, when I calculated the exponent:\n\n(\u0394E) * (1/(k)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is (8.56 eV) * (1.5151e-5) / (k in eV/K?)\n\nWait, no, because I converted \u0394E to J already.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used k in eV/(K) to make the units consistent. Let me think.\n\nWait, another approach: express k in eV/K.\n\nk = 8.617333262...e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo, perhaps it's easier to compute everything in eV and K.\n\nSo, E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV.\n\nSo, the exponent is:\n\n(E2 - E1) = -8.56 eV.\n\nSo,\n\nExponent = (-8.56 eV) * [ (1/(6000 K) ) - (1/(5500 K) ) ] / (k )\n\nBut wait, the Boltzmann equation uses (E2 - E1)/(k T), so perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nRatio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, for T1=6000 K, R1 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T1) )\n\nSimilarly, R2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T2) )\n\nSo, R1/R2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ) )\n\nBut E2 - E1 is negative, so let me compute:\n\n(E2 - E1) = -8.56 eV.\n\nSo,\n\n(1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) K^-1 = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 * 5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -5/(330,000) ) = -1/(66,000) ) \u2248 -1.515e-5 K^-1.\n\nSo,\n\nExponent = (E2 - E1) * (1/(k)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2 )\n\nWhich is:\n\n(-8.56 eV) * ( -1.515e-5 K^-1 ) / (k )\n\nBut wait, k is in eV/(K), so when we multiply by 1/(k), it's (1/(k)) which is K/(eV).\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute the exponent in terms of units:\n\n(E2 - E1) is in eV, (1/T1 - 1/T2) is in 1/K, and k is in eV/K.\n\nSo, exponent = [ (E2 - E1) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ] / (k )\n\nWhich is (eV * 1/K ) / (eV/K ) ) \u2192 the eV cancels, K cancels, giving a dimensionless exponent.\n\nSo,\n\nExponent = ( (-8.56 eV) * (-1.515e-5 1/K) ) / (8.617e-5 eV/K )\n\nCompute numerator: (-8.56) * (-1.515e-5) = 8.56 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 let's compute 8 * 1.5e-5 = 1.2e-4, 0.56 * 1.5e-5=8.4e-6. So total is approx 1.284e-4.\n\nDenominator: 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo, exponent = (1.284e-4) / (8.617e-5) \u2248 1.284e-4 / 8.617e-5 \u2248 1.49.\n\nSo, exponent \u2248 1.49.\n\nThen, R1/R2 = exp(1.49) \u2248 e^1.49.\n\nWhat's e^1.49?\n\nWe know that e^1 \u22482.718, e^1.4\u22484.055, e^1.5\u22484.4817. So, 1.49 is just a bit less than 1.5, so e^1.49\u22484.44.\n\nSo, the factor is about 4.44, which is closest to option C, ~4.5.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, \\( N_1/N_2 \\), using the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \\frac{g_1}{g_2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( g_1 \\) and \\( g_2 \\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\) are the energies of the levels, \\( k \\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \\( T \\) is the temperature.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.\n\nAlright, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. \n\nThe question then talks about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 \u00c5, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nHmm, okay. So, the key here is to understand how the ratio of atoms in two energy levels depends on temperature. I remember that the ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature of the star goes down. But how does this affect the photospheric temperature where the Ti lines are formed?\n\nWait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So I think that the photospheric temperature here is the average, but perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature than the rest. But wait, the question is about the photosphere's effective temperature. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read.\n\nWhen 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K in that case. But wait, how does that affect the photosphere where the Ti is? Hmm, perhaps each part of the photosphere is at a different temperature. But the problem says the photosphere is in LTE, so maybe each region is in local thermodynamic equilibrium, but the overall effective temperature is lower because some regions are cooler.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So if the temperature of the photosphere where these atoms are located changes, then the ratio would change. But wait, when the star has spots, some regions are cooler. So the average temperature of the photosphere might be lower. But does that mean the local temperature where Ti is located is lower?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average of the entire photosphere, but the Ti lines form in regions where the temperature has changed. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K on average. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the spots are cooler, so the surrounding areas must be hotter. But the question says the overall Teff is 5500 K. Maybe the star's total luminosity is lower because 40% of the surface is cooler, hence the effective temperature is lower.\n\nBut for the purpose of the problem, perhaps the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So when the star doesn't have spots, the Teff is 6000 K. So the ratio of Ti atoms in the two levels depends on the temperature, so the ratio when T=6000 K versus when T=5500 K.\n\nWait, the ratio of n1 to n2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Wait, no, the Boltzmann factor is exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), so if E2 > E1, then higher energy level.\n\nWait, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ), because n_i = (g_i) * exp( - E_i/(k T) ) / Z, so n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nAlternatively, the ratio could also be written as n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), depending on which way you write it.\n\nBut the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower than when they are not. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when T was 6000 K.\n\nWait, so if the ratio is n1/n2, and when T decreases, the ratio decreases. Let me think about what that implies.\n\nThe ratio is (g1/g2) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nIf E2 > E1, then (E1 - E2) is negative. So the exponent is negative, so the exponential becomes exp( negative number ), which is a fraction.\n\nSo if E2 > E1, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) multiplied by a number less than 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T goes down from 6000 to 5500, the ratio goes down. So the ratio is lower at lower T.\n\nLet me think about how the ratio depends on T. For a given (E2 - E1), which is positive, the term (E1-E2)/(k T) is negative. So exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) ) is exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T increases, the denominator k T increases, so the exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential increases. So the ratio (n1/n2) increases when T increases, assuming E2 > E1.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, i.e., when T is lower. So that fits with E2 > E1. Because when T is lower, the exponential term is smaller, so the ratio is smaller.\n\nSo the ratio when the star has no spots is higher than when it has spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nSo the factor is ( (g1/g2) exp( (E1-E2)/(k T1) ) ) / ( (g1/g2) exp( (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ) )\n\nThe g1/g2 cancels out, so it's exp( (E1-E2)/(k T1) - (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) )\n\nFactor = exp( (E1 - E2)/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, but E2 > E1, so (E1 - E2) is negative. So 1/T1 is higher than 1/T2 (since T1=6000, T2=5500). So (1/T1 - 1/T2) is positive.\n\nSo the exponent is (negative) * (positive) = negative. So exp(negative) is a value less than 1. So the factor is less than 1? But that would imply that the ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present, which is what the problem states. So the factor is the ratio no_spots / spots.\n\nWait, but the options are factors. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = exp( (E1 - E2)/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nBut I don't know the actual energy difference between the levels. However, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. So I can find the energy difference using the wavelength.\n\nThe energy of a photon is E = hc / \u03bb.\n\nSo E2 - E1 = hc / \u03bb.\n\nSo E2 - E1 = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) )\n\nCalculating that:\n\n6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m\n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approx 1.373e-18 J.\n\nBut wait, that's the energy of a single photon. So E2 - E1 = 1.373e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut we can also express this in terms of eV for easier handling with Boltzmann's constant. Let me compute that.\n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo E_photon = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, but wait, E2 - E1 is equal to the photon energy, right? Because when an electron transitions from E2 to E1, it emits a photon with energy E2 - E1.\n\nSo E2 - E1 = 8.57 eV.\n\nNow, let's compute (E1 - E2) = -8.57 eV.\n\nBut in the exponent, we have (E1 - E2)/(k T) = (-8.57 eV) / (k T).\n\nWait, but k is Boltzmann's constant in eV/K terms. So k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo, let's compute the exponent.\n\nCompute (E1-E2)/(k T1) - (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) = (E1-E2)/k [1/T1 - 1/T2 ]\n\nWait, (E1 - E2) = -8.57 eV.\n\nSo the entire term becomes:\n\n(-8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (1/6000 K - 1/5500 K )\n\nCompute the term inside the brackets: (1/6000 - 1/5500) K^-1.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1/6000 \u2248 0.000166667\n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818\n\nSo 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151 K^-1.\n\nSo now, the entire exponent term:\n\n( -8.57 ) / (8.617e-5) ) * (-0.000015151 )\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (-8.57) / (8.617e-5):\n\n= -8.57 / 0.00008617\n\n= approximately -8.57 / 8.617e-5.\n\nLet me compute 8.57 / 8.617e-5.\n\n8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 Let's compute:\n\n0.00008617 is 8.617e-5.\n\nSo 8.57 / 8.617e-5 \u2248 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 approximately 99442.\n\nWait, let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617.\n\n8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 Let's see:\n\n0.00008617 * 99442 \u2248 8.57? Let me compute 0.00008617 * 100,000 = 8.617, so 0.00008617 * 99442 \u2248 8.57.\n\nSo, 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 ~99442.\n\nSo (-8.57) / (8.617e-5) ) \u2248 -99442.\n\nNow multiply by (-0.000015151):\n\n-99442 * (-0.000015151) = 99442 * 0.000015151.\n\nCompute 99442 * 0.000015151.\n\nWell, 1e5 * 0.000015 is 1.5, so 99442 is about 99,442. So 99,442 * 0.000015151 \u2248 let's compute:\n\nApproximately 99,442 * 1.5151e-5.\n\nCompute 99,442 * 1.5151e-5.\n\nCompute 99,442 * 1.5151 = let's approximate.\n\n99,442 * 1.5 = 149,163.\n\n99,442 * 0.0151 = approximately 1,502.\n\nSo total about 150,665.\n\nMultiply by 1e-5: 150,665e-5 = 1.50665.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.50665.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.50665) \u2248 e^1.50665.\n\nWhat's e^1.5? e^1 is about 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.648, so e^1.5 is 2.718 * 1.648 \u2248 4.48.\n\nWait, but 1.50665 is a bit more than 1.5. Let me compute e^1.50665 more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute ln(5) is about 1.609, so 1.50665 is a bit less than that. Let's see, e^1.50665 \u2248 4.5.\n\nWait, let me think. e^1 = 2.718, e^1.1 \u2248 3.004, e^1.2 \u2248 3.32, e^1.3 \u2248 3.67, e^1.4 \u2248 4.055, e^1.5 \u2248 4.4817, e^1.6 \u2248 4.953.\n\nWait, 1.50665 is just a bit more than 1.5, so e^1.50665 \u2248 4.5.\n\nWait, but wait, 1.50665 is 1.5 + 0.00665. Let me compute the Taylor expansion around x=1.5.\n\ne^(x) = e^1.5 * e^(x-1.5). x-1.5 is 0.00665.\n\ne^0.00665 \u2248 1 + 0.00665 + (0.00665)^2/2 \u2248 1.00665 + 0.000022 \u2248 1.006672.\n\nSo e^1.50665 \u2248 e^1.5 * 1.006672 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.006672 \u2248 approximately 4.4817 + (4.4817 * 0.006672) \u2248 4.4817 + 0.03 \u2248 4.51.\n\nSo the factor is about 4.51. So the ratio when the star has no spots is about 4.5 times higher than when it has spots.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made an error in the signs.\n\nWait, the exponent was (E1-E2)/(k T1) - (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) = (E1-E2)/k (1/T1 - 1/T2 )\n\nE1-E2 is negative, and (1/T1 - 1/T2) is also negative because T2 < T1. So the product is positive.\n\nSo the exponent is positive, so the factor is e^(positive), which is greater than 1, meaning the ratio without spots is higher than with spots, which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5, so the correct answer should be option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.\n\nAlright, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. \n\nThe question then talks about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 \u00c5, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nHmm, okay. So, the key here is to understand how the ratio of atoms in two energy levels depends on temperature. I remember that the ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature of the star goes down. But how does this affect the photospheric temperature where the Ti lines are formed?\n\nWait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So I think that the photospheric temperature here is the average, but perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature than the rest. But wait, the question is about the photosphere's effective temperature. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read.\n\nWhen 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K in that case. But wait, how does that affect the photosphere where the Ti is? Hmm, perhaps each part of the photosphere is at a different temperature. But the problem says the photosphere is in LTE, so maybe each region is in local thermodynamic equilibrium, but the overall effective temperature is lower because some regions are cooler.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So if the temperature of the photosphere where these atoms are located changes, then the ratio would change. But wait, when the star has spots, some regions are cooler. So the average temperature of the photosphere might be lower. But does that mean the local temperature where Ti is located is lower?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average of the entire photosphere, but the Ti lines form in regions where the temperature has changed. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K on average. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the spots are cooler, so the surrounding areas must be hotter. But the question says the overall Teff is 5500 K. Maybe the star's total luminosity is lower because 40% of the surface is cooler, hence the effective temperature is lower.\n\nBut for the purpose of the problem, perhaps the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So when the star doesn't have spots, the Teff is 6000 K. So the ratio of Ti atoms in the two levels depends on the temperature, so the ratio when T=6000 K versus when T=5500 K.\n\nWait, the ratio of n1 to n2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Wait, no, the Boltzmann factor is exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), so if E2 > E1, then higher energy level.\n\nWait, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ), because n_i = (g_i) * exp( - E_i/(k T) ) / Z, so n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nAlternatively, the ratio could also be written as n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), depending on which way you write it.\n\nBut the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower than when they are not. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when T was 6000 K.\n\nWait, so if the ratio is n1/n2, and when T decreases, the ratio decreases. Let me think about what that implies.\n\nThe ratio is (g1/g2) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nIf E2 > E1, then (E1 - E2) is negative. So the exponent is negative, so the exponential becomes exp( negative number ), which is a fraction.\n\nSo if E2 > E1, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) multiplied by a number less than 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T goes down from 6000 to 5500, the ratio goes down. So the ratio is lower at lower T.\n\nLet me think about how the ratio depends on T. For a given (E2 - E1), which is positive, the term (E1-E2)/(k T) is negative. So exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) ) is exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T increases, the denominator k T increases, so the exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential increases. So the ratio (n1/n2) increases when T increases, assuming E2 > E1.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, i.e., when T is lower. So that fits with E2 > E1. Because when T is lower, the exponential term is smaller, so the ratio is smaller.\n\nSo the ratio when the star has no spots is higher than when it has spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nSo the factor is ( (g1/g2) exp( (E1-E2)/(k T1) ) ) / ( (g1/g2) exp( (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ) )\n\nThe g1/g2 cancels out, so it's exp( (E1-E2)/(k T1) - (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) )\n\nFactor = exp( (E1 - E2)/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, but E2 > E1, so (E1 - E2) is negative. So 1/T1 is higher than 1/T2 (since T1=6000, T2=5500). So (1/T1 - 1/T2) is positive.\n\nSo the exponent is (negative) * (positive) = negative. So exp(negative) is a value less than 1. So the factor is less than 1? But that would imply that the ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present, which is what the problem states. So the factor is the ratio no_spots / spots.\n\nWait, but the options are factors. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = exp( (E1 - E2)/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nBut I don't know the actual energy difference between the levels. However, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. So I can find the energy difference using the wavelength.\n\nThe energy of a photon is E = hc / \u03bb.\n\nSo E2 - E1 = hc / \u03bb.\n\nSo E2 - E1 = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) )\n\nCalculating that:\n\n6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m\n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approx 1.373e-18 J.\n\nBut wait, that's the energy of a single photon. So E2 - E1 = 1.373e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut we can also express this in terms of eV for easier handling with Boltzmann's constant. Let me compute that.\n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo E_photon = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, but wait, E2 - E1 is equal to the photon energy, right? Because when an electron transitions from E2 to E1, it emits a photon with energy E2 - E1.\n\nSo E2 - E1 = 8.57 eV.\n\nNow, let's compute (E1 - E2) = -8.57 eV.\n\nBut in the exponent, we have (E1 - E2)/(k T) = (-8.57 eV) / (k T).\n\nWait, but k is Boltzmann's constant in eV/K terms. So k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo, let's compute the exponent.\n\nCompute (E1-E2)/(k T1) - (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) = (E1-E2)/k [1/T1 - 1/T2 ]\n\nWait, (E1 - E2) = -8.57 eV.\n\nSo the entire term becomes:\n\n(-8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (1/6000 K - 1/5500 K )\n\nCompute the term inside the brackets: (1/6000 - 1/5500) K^-1.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1/6000 \u2248 0.000166667\n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818\n\nSo 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151 K^-1.\n\nSo now, the entire exponent term:\n\n( -8.57 ) / (8.617e-5) ) * (-0.000015151 )\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (-8.57) / (8.617e-5):\n\n= -8.57 / 0.00008617\n\n= approximately -8.57 / 8.617e-5.\n\nLet me compute 8.57 / 8.617e-5.\n\n8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 Let's compute:\n\n0.00008617 is 8.617e-5.\n\nSo 8.57 / 8.617e-5 \u2248 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 approximately 99442.\n\nWait, let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617.\n\n8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 Let's see:\n\n0.00008617 * 99442 \u2248 8.57? Let me compute 0.00008617 * 100,000 = 8.617, so 0.00008617 * 99442 \u2248 8.57.\n\nSo, 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 ~99442.\n\nSo (-8.57) / (8.617e-5) ) \u2248 -99442.\n\nNow multiply by (-0.000015151):\n\n-99442 * (-0.000015151) = 99442 * 0.000015151.\n\nCompute 99442 * 0.000015151.\n\nWell, 1e5 * 0.000015 is 1.5, so 99442 is about 99,442. So 99,442 * 0.000015151 \u2248 let's compute:\n\nApproximately 99,442 * 1.5151e-5.\n\nCompute 99,442 * 1.5151e-5.\n\nCompute 99,442 * 1.5151 = let's approximate.\n\n99,442 * 1.5 = 149,163.\n\n99,442 * 0.0151 = approximately 1,502.\n\nSo total about 150,665.\n\nMultiply by 1e-5: 150,665e-5 = 1.50665.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.50665.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.50665) \u2248 e^1.50665.\n\nWhat's e^1.5? e^1 is about 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.648, so e^1.5 is 2.718 * 1.648 \u2248 4.48.\n\nWait, but 1.50665 is a bit more than 1.5. Let me compute e^1.50665 more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute ln(5) is about 1.609, so 1.50665 is a bit less than that. Let's see, e^1.50665 \u2248 4.5.\n\nWait, let me think. e^1 = 2.718, e^1.1 \u2248 3.004, e^1.2 \u2248 3.32, e^1.3 \u2248 3.67, e^1.4 \u2248 4.055, e^1.5 \u2248 4.4817, e^1.6 \u2248 4.953.\n\nWait, 1.50665 is just a bit more than 1.5, so e^1.50665 \u2248 4.5.\n\nWait, but wait, 1.50665 is 1.5 + 0.00665. Let me compute the Taylor expansion around x=1.5.\n\ne^(x) = e^1.5 * e^(x-1.5). x-1.5 is 0.00665.\n\ne^0.00665 \u2248 1 + 0.00665 + (0.00665)^2/2 \u2248 1.00665 + 0.000022 \u2248 1.006672.\n\nSo e^1.50665 \u2248 e^1.5 * 1.006672 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.006672 \u2248 approximately 4.4817 + (4.4817 * 0.006672) \u2248 4.4817 + 0.03 \u2248 4.51.\n\nSo the factor is about 4.51. So the ratio when the star has no spots is about 4.5 times higher than when it has spots.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made an error in the signs.\n\nWait, the exponent was (E1-E2)/(k T1) - (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) = (E1-E2)/k (1/T1 - 1/T2 )\n\nE1-E2 is negative, and (1/T1 - 1/T2) is also negative because T2 < T1. So the product is positive.\n\nSo the exponent is positive, so the factor is e^(positive), which is greater than 1, meaning the ratio without spots is higher than with spots, which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5, so the correct answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \\frac{g_1}{g_2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_1 - E_2}{kT}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( g_1 \\) and \\( g_2 \\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\) are the energies of the levels, \\( k \\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \\( T \\) is the temperature. The ratio changes due to the temperature difference between the two scenarios: \\( T_1 = 6000 \\, \\text{K} \\) (no spots) and \\( T_2 = 5500 \\, \\text{K} \\) (spots present).\n\nThe energy difference between the levels is determined from the transition wavelength \\( \\lambda = 1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\). Using the relation \\( E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\), where \\( h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s} \\) and \\( c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\), we calculate:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34})(3 \\times 10^8)}{1448 \\times 10^{-10}} \\approx 1.373 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}.\n\\]\n\nConverting to electron volts (\\( 1 \\, \\text{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\)):\n\n\\[\nE \\approx \\frac{1.373 \\times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 8.57 \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( E_2 - E_1 = 8.57 \\, \\text{eV} \\), and \\( E_1 - E_2 = -8.57 \\, \\text{eV} \\).\n\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{\\text{no spots}}}{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{\\text{spots}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)\\right).\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( E_1 - E_2 = -8.57 \\, \\text{eV} \\), \\( k = 8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/K} \\), \\( T_1 = 6000 \\, \\text{K} \\), and \\( T_2 = 5500 \\, \\text{K} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Factor} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{-8.57}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} \\left(\\frac{1}{6000} - \\frac{1}{5500}\\right)\\right).\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( \\frac{1}{6000} - \\frac{1}{5500} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6000} \\approx 0.000166667, \\quad \\frac{1}{5500} \\approx 0.000181818, \\quad \\frac{1}{6000} - \\frac{1}{5500} \\approx -0.000015151 \\, \\text{K}^{-1}.\n\\]\n\nNow compute the exponent:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-8.57}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx -99442, \\quad -99442 \\times (-0.000015151) \\approx 1.50665.\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Factor} = \\exp(1.50665) \\approx 4.5.\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.\n\nThe problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. \n\nThe main question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.\n\nHmm, okay. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower. That means the ratio is higher without spots. So the factor would be the ratio when no spots divided by the ratio when there are spots.\n\nWait, the ratio they're talking about is n1/n2, where n1 is the number in level 1 and n2 in level 2. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower. So when it doesn't have spots, n1/n2 is higher. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.\n\nI remember from the Boltzmann equation that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the transition between the levels is at 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near UV. But the effective temperature is given as 5500 K and 6000 K. So the temperature affects the excitation of these levels.\n\nWait, but wait. The star's photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann equation applies. So the ratio of the populations depends on the temperature.\n\nSo when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, wait a second. Are the spots causing the overall Teff to be lower, or is the effective temperature measured considering the spots? Because spots are cooler regions. So the star's overall luminosity would be less when spots are present because 40% of its surface is cooler.\n\nBut in the problem, the Teff is given as 5500 K when spots are present. Teff is the effective temperature, which is related to the star's luminosity and radius. So when spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff drops. So the star's average temperature is lower when spots are present.\n\nBut wait, the photospheric temperature... the spots are cooler, but the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. So when spots are present, the star's surface has some regions at 6000 K and 40% at lower temperatures. But the overall effective temperature is 5500 K.\n\nBut the question is about the photospheric effective temperature. Wait, the problem states that when the surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the overall Teff is lower because the spots are cooler.\n\nWait, but the photosphere's temperature is more complicated. Because the star's surface has some areas at 6000 K and others at lower. But when the star has spots, the overall photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. So for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we're to assume that the effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when not.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. That's in the near-UV, which I think is around 1448 Angstroms. Hmm, but how does that tie into the problem?\n\nWait, the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels depends on the temperature. Because when the temperature is higher, more atoms are in higher energy levels.\n\nWait, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, making the ratio n1/n2 larger. Because E2 is higher than E1, so E2 - E1 is positive. So higher T makes the exponent less negative, so the ratio increases.\n\nWait, let me think. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n1/n2 increases. So when the star has no spots, the temperature is higher (6000 K) compared to when it has spots (5500 K). So when the star has no spots, the ratio n1/n2 is higher than when it has spots.\n\nWhich aligns with the observation that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\n\nSo the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.\n\nUsing the Boltzmann equation:\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nBut since g1/g2 is a constant (the ratio of statistical weights), when we take the ratio of the two cases (no spots and with spots), the g1/g2 terms will cancel out.\n\nSo, the factor is [exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_with_spots) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T_with_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots) ] )\n\nWait, let's do the math:\n\nFactor = [exp(-\u0394E/(k T1))] / [exp(-\u0394E/(k T2))] where T1 is no spots (6000 K) and T2 is with spots (5500 K).\n\nSo that's exp[ (-\u0394E/(k T1) ) + (\u0394E/(k T2) ) ]\n\nWhich is exp[ \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]\n\nWait, because (-\u0394E/(k T1) ) - (-\u0394E/(k T2)) = \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )\n\nWait, no, wait: Let me re-express.\n\nWait, the denominator is when spots are present, so T is 5500 K. So T2 = 5500 K. T1 = 6000 K.\n\nSo the factor is [n1/n2]_T1 / [n1/n2]_T2 = exp[ (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]\n\nBecause:\n\nn1/n2 = exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo the ratio is [exp(-\u0394E/(k T1))] / [exp(-\u0394E/(k T2))] = exp[ ( -\u0394E/(k T1) + \u0394E/(k T2) ) ]\n\nWhich is exp[ \u0394E/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]\n\nSo that's the factor.\n\nNow, we can compute this. But wait, do we have \u0394E? Or can we find it from the wavelength?\n\nYes, because the transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength \u03bb of 1448 \u00c5. That's the emission or absorption line. So the energy difference \u0394E corresponds to the photon energy h c / \u03bb.\n\nSo \u0394E = h c / \u03bb.\n\nWe can compute \u0394E in terms of k (Boltzmann's constant) because the factor is in terms of \u0394E/(k).\n\nSo let's compute (\u0394E)/(k) = (h c)/(\u03bb k)\n\nSo let's calculate that value.\n\nWe can plug in the constants:\n\nh (Planck's constant) = 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nk (Boltzmann's constant) = 1.380649e-23 J/K\n\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m.\n\nSo let's compute h c / (\u03bb k):\n\nh c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDivide by \u03bb k:\n\n(1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (1448e-10 m * 1.3806e-23 J/K )\n\nLet me compute denominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.3806e-23 J/K = 1448 * 1.3806e-33 J\u00b7m/K\n\nWait, let me compute the numbers:\n\nFirst, compute 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nThen, \u03bb k = 1.448e-7 m * 1.3806e-23 J/K = 2.000e-30 J\u00b7m/K.\n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait, 1448e-10 m is 1.448e-7 meters.\n\nSo \u03bb*k = 1.448e-7 m * 1.3806e-23 J/K.\n\nCompute 1.448e-7 * 1.3806e-23 = (1.448 * 1.3806) * 1e-30.\n\n1.448 * 1.3806 \u2248 let's compute that:\n\n1.4 * 1.38 = ~1.932. Let's be precise:\n\n1.448 * 1.3806:\n\n1.448 * 1 = 1.448\n\n1.448 * 0.3 = 0.4344\n\n1.448 * 0.08 = 0.11584\n\n1.448 * 0.0006 = 0.0008688\n\nAdding up: 1.448 + 0.4344 = 1.8824, + 0.11584 = 1.99824, + 0.0008688 \u2248 2. So approximately 2.000e-30 J\u00b7m/K.\n\nSo h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo (h c)/(\u03bb k) = (1.9878e-25) / (2.000e-30) ) \u2248 1.9878e5 / 2 \u2248 9.939e4.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that.\n\n1.9878e-25 / 2.000e-30 = (1.9878 / 2 ) * 1e5 = 0.9939 * 1e5 = 9.939e4.\n\nSo (h c)/(\u03bb k) \u2248 9.939e4 K.\n\nWait, because the units would be (J\u00b7s * m/s) / (m * J/K) ) \u2192 (J\u00b7m) / (J\u00b7m/K) ) \u2192 K.\n\nSo (\u0394E)/(k) = (h c)/(\u03bb k) \u2248 9.939e4 K.\n\nSo we can write this as approximately 9.94e4 K.\n\nSo now, the factor is exp[ (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]\n\nWait, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nSo 1/T2 = 1/5500 \u2248 1.818e-4 K^-1\n\n1/T1 = 1/6000 \u2248 1.6667e-4 K^-1\n\nThe difference (1/T2 - 1/T1) is approximately (1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4) = 0.1513e-4 \u2248 1.513e-5 K^-1.\n\nSo the term inside the exponent is 9.94e4 K * 1.513e-5 K^-1 = Let's compute that.\n\n9.94e4 * 1.513e-5 = (9.94 * 1.513) * 1e-1.\n\n9.94 * 1.513 \u2248 Let's compute 10 * 1.513 = 15.13, but subtract 0.06 * 1.513 \u2248 0.0908, so about 15.039.\n\nSo 15.039 * 0.1 = 1.5039.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.5039.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.5039) \u2248 e^1.5039.\n\nWe know that e^1 \u2248 2.718, e^1.5 \u2248 4.4817, e^1.6 \u2248 4.953.\n\nWait, let me compute e^1.5039 more accurately.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series or a calculator approximation.\n\nBut perhaps I can recall that ln(4.5) is about 1.504, because ln(4) is 1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504, yes. Because e^1.504 \u2248 4.5.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Because ln(4.5) is approximately 1.5040774. So e^1.504 \u2248 4.5.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check:\n\nln(4.5) = ln(9/2) = ln(9) - ln(2) = 2.1972 - 0.6931 = 1.5041. So yes, e^1.5041 is about 4.5.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5.\n\nSo the answer should be C.\n",

So when the star has no spots, the ratio n1/n2 is higher than when it has spots.\n\nWhich aligns with the observation that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\n\nSo the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.\n\nUsing the Boltzmann equation:\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nBut since g1/g2 is a constant (the ratio of statistical weights), when we take the ratio of the two cases (no spots and with spots), the g1/g2 terms will cancel out.\n\nSo, the factor is [exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_with_spots) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T_with_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots) ] )\n\nWait, let's do the math:\n\nFactor = [exp(-\u0394E/(k T1))] / [exp(-\u0394E/(k T2))] where T1 is no spots (6000 K) and T2 is with spots (5500 K).\n\nSo that's exp[ (-\u0394E/(k T1) ) + (\u0394E/(k T2) ) ]\n\nWhich is exp[ \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]\n\nWait, because (-\u0394E/(k T1) ) - (-\u0394E/(k T2)) = \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )\n\nWait, no, wait: Let me re-express.\n\nWait, the denominator is when spots are present, so T is 5500 K. So T2 = 5500 K. T1 = 6000 K.\n\nSo the factor is [n1/n2]_T1 / [n1/n2]_T2 = exp[ (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]\n\nBecause:\n\nn1/n2 = exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo the ratio is [exp(-\u0394E/(k T1))] / [exp(-\u0394E/(k T2))] = exp[ ( -\u0394E/(k T1) + \u0394E/(k T2) ) ]\n\nWhich is exp[ \u0394E/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]\n\nSo that's the factor.\n\nNow, we can compute this. But wait, do we have \u0394E? Or can we find it from the wavelength?\n\nYes, because the transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength \u03bb of 1448 \u00c5. That's the emission or absorption line. So the energy difference \u0394E corresponds to the photon energy h c / \u03bb.\n\nSo \u0394E = h c / \u03bb.\n\nWe can compute \u0394E in terms of k (Boltzmann's constant) because the factor is in terms of \u0394E/(k).\n\nSo let's compute (\u0394E)/(k) = (h c)/(\u03bb k)\n\nSo let's calculate that value.\n\nWe can plug in the constants:\n\nh (Planck's constant) = 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nk (Boltzmann's constant) = 1.380649e-23 J/K\n\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m.\n\nSo let's compute h c / (\u03bb k):\n\nh c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDivide by \u03bb k:\n\n(1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (1448e-10 m * 1.3806e-23 J/K )\n\nLet me compute denominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.3806e-23 J/K = 1448 * 1.3806e-33 J\u00b7m/K\n\nWait, let me compute the numbers:\n\nFirst, compute 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nThen, \u03bb k = 1.448e-7 m * 1.3806e-23 J/K = 2.000e-30 J\u00b7m/K.\n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait, 1448e-10 m is 1.448e-7 meters.\n\nSo \u03bb*k = 1.448e-7 m * 1.3806e-23 J/K.\n\nCompute 1.448e-7 * 1.3806e-23 = (1.448 * 1.3806) * 1e-30.\n\n1.448 * 1.3806 \u2248 let's compute that:\n\n1.4 * 1.38 = ~1.932. Let's be precise:\n\n1.448 * 1.3806:\n\n1.448 * 1 = 1.448\n\n1.448 * 0.3 = 0.4344\n\n1.448 * 0.08 = 0.11584\n\n1.448 * 0.0006 = 0.0008688\n\nAdding up: 1.448 + 0.4344 = 1.8824, + 0.11584 = 1.99824, + 0.0008688 \u2248 2. So approximately 2.000e-30 J\u00b7m/K.\n\nSo h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo (h c)/(\u03bb k) = (1.9878e-25) / (2.000e-30) ) \u2248 1.9878e5 / 2 \u2248 9.939e4.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that.\n\n1.9878e-25 / 2.000e-30 = (1.9878 / 2 ) * 1e5 = 0.9939 * 1e5 = 9.939e4.\n\nSo (h c)/(\u03bb k) \u2248 9.939e4 K.\n\nWait, because the units would be (J\u00b7s * m/s) / (m * J/K) ) \u2192 (J\u00b7m) / (J\u00b7m/K) ) \u2192 K.\n\nSo (\u0394E)/(k) = (h c)/(\u03bb k) \u2248 9.939e4 K.\n\nSo we can write this as approximately 9.94e4 K.\n\nSo now, the factor is exp[ (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]\n\nWait, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nSo 1/T2 = 1/5500 \u2248 1.818e-4 K^-1\n\n1/T1 = 1/6000 \u2248 1.6667e-4 K^-1\n\nThe difference (1/T2 - 1/T1) is approximately (1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4) = 0.1513e-4 \u2248 1.513e-5 K^-1.\n\nSo the term inside the exponent is 9.94e4 K * 1.513e-5 K^-1 = Let's compute that.\n\n9.94e4 * 1.513e-5 = (9.94 * 1.513) * 1e-1.\n\n9.94 * 1.513 \u2248 Let's compute 10 * 1.513 = 15.13, but subtract 0.06 * 1.513 \u2248 0.0908, so about 15.039.\n\nSo 15.039 * 0.1 = 1.5039.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.5039.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.5039) \u2248 e^1.5039.\n\nWe know that e^1 \u2248 2.718, e^1.5 \u2248 4.4817, e^1.6 \u2248 4.953.\n\nWait, let me compute e^1.5039 more accurately.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series or a calculator approximation.\n\nBut perhaps I can recall that ln(4.5) is about 1.504, because ln(4) is 1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504, yes. Because e^1.504 \u2248 4.5.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Because ln(4.5) is approximately 1.5040774. So e^1.504 \u2248 4.5.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check:\n\nln(4.5) = ln(9/2) = ln(9) - ln(2) = 2.1972 - 0.6931 = 1.5041. So yes, e^1.5041 is about 4.5.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5.\n\nSo the answer should be C.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from being spotless to having spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \\frac{g_1}{g_2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \\(\\Delta E\\) is the energy difference between the levels, \\(k\\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nSo, the problem involves a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure why the Teff would change when spots are present, but I remember that sunspots are cooler regions on the Sun's surface. So when a star has spots, those areas are cooler, which probably lowers the overall effective temperature because the spots emit less light.\n\nNow, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes\u2014comparing when there are no spots to when there are spots. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct factor.\n\nI think this has to do with the Saha equation, which relates the ionization states of atoms to temperature and density. Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of two energy levels of the same ion, Ti I (neutral), so maybe it's more about the Boltzmann equation instead of the Saha equation. The Boltzmann equation deals with the distribution of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) )\n\nWhere:\n- n is the number of particles in each level,\n- g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy) of each level,\n- E is the energy of each level,\n- k is Boltzmann's constant,\n- T is the temperature.\n\nIn this case, the ratio is n1/n2. So rearranging the equation, n1/n2 would be the inverse of that. So,\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )\n\nBut the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Since the spots cause the overall photospheric temperature to drop from 6000 K to 5500 K, I think that the temperature in the photosphere is lower when there are spots. So, the ratio n1/n2 is lower when T is lower. Wait, but how does temperature affect the ratio?\n\nWait, the ratio n1/n2 depends on the exponential term. Let me think. The exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T). If E2 is higher than E1 (since level 2 is a higher energy level), then (E2-E1) is positive. So the exponent is positive. So when T increases, the exponent becomes a smaller number (since denominator is larger), so exp() becomes smaller. Because e^(-x) is smaller when x is larger. Wait no, wait. Let me double-check:\n\nThe exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k T). Let's say E2 > E1, so this is positive. So when T increases, the exponent becomes smaller (because T is in denominator). So exp(positive number) is a positive value. Wait, if the exponent is smaller, then exp(small) is a larger value? No, wait: for example, exp(1) is about 2.718, exp(0.5) is about 1.648, exp(0.1) is about 1.105. So as the exponent decreases (because T increases), the exponential value increases. Wait, no: if T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) becomes smaller. So exp(small) is larger than exp(bigger). For example, when T is high, the exponent is small, so exp(small) is closer to 1. Wait, no: if the exponent is 0.1, exp is 1.105. If the exponent is 0.2, exp is about 1.221. So higher T (lower exponent) makes the exponential term smaller? Wait, no: when T is higher, the denominator is bigger, so the exponent is smaller. So if E2-E1 is positive, then when T increases, the exponent decreases. So the exponential term is e^{(E2-E1)/(k T)} which becomes smaller as T increases. Wait, no. Because if T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) is a smaller positive number, so e^smaller is a larger number? No, because e^0.1 is larger than e^0.05. Wait, no: when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller. So e^{smaller positive} is larger? No, wait, e^0 is 1, e^0.1 is about 1.1, e^0.2 is 1.22, e^0.3 is 1.35. So as T increases, the exponent decreases, so the exponential increases. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think: If T doubles, the exponent is halved. So for T1=5000 K, exponent x1 = (E2-E1)/(k*5000). For T2=6000 K, x2 = x1*(5000/6000) = 5/6 x1. So x2 is smaller than x1. So exp(x2) is larger than exp(x1), because x2 is smaller and positive. So as T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp() increases. That means that n2/n1 would be higher when T is higher. So n1/n2 would be lower when T is higher.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify. The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp() of a smaller positive number is a larger number? No, because as the exponent decreases, the exp() approaches 1 from above. Wait, no. Let me take an example. Suppose E2-E1 = 10 eV (just a number, but in reality, it's in terms of eV, but maybe that's not necessary). So for T = 5000 K:\n\nx = (10) / (k * 5000). Let's compute k in eV/K. Wait, k is about 8.617 \u00d7 10^-5 eV/K. So k*5000 = 8.617e-5 *5e3 = 0.43085 eV. So x = 10 / 0.43085 \u2248 23.2.\n\nWait, that's a very large exponent. So e^23 is a huge number. But wait, this can't be right because in stars, most atoms are in the lower energy states. Maybe my numbers are way off. Alternatively, perhaps E2-E1 is much smaller. Let's think in terms of the wavelength given: the transition corresponds to 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near UV or visible range.\n\nThe energy difference between the levels can be found using E = hc/\u03bb. Let's compute that. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. The speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. Wavelength \u03bb is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = (1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (1.448e-7 m) = approx 1.372e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut we need this in terms of eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nSo E2-E1 is about 8.56 eV. So that's a big energy jump. Hmm, but that would make the Boltzmann factor very small. Because at higher temperatures, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is a big number.\n\nWait, but for T = 5500 K, let's compute (E2-E1)/(k T):\n\nE2-E1 = 8.56 eV.\n\nk is 8.617e-5 eV/K. T is 5500 K.\n\nSo (8.56) / (8.617e-5 * 5500) = 8.56 / (0.473935) \u2248 18.07.\n\nSo the exponent is about 18.07. So exp(18.07) is a huge number. So n2 would be much smaller than n1, because the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp(18), which is about 1e7.7, which is around 5 million. So n2 is much less than n1.\n\nWait, but wait a second. If E2 is higher than E1, and the exponent is positive, then the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which is a large number when (E2-E1) is large relative to k T.\n\nBut when the temperature decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent becomes larger, making exp() even bigger. So n2/n1 would be even larger when T is lower. But the question says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that would imply that n1/n2 is lower when T is lower.\n\nWait, let me think. The ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )^{-1} }.\n\nWait, no, the Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, wait, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Let me get this right. The Boltzmann equation is:\n\nn_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nSo if i is level 2 and j is level 1, then n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSince E2 > E1, (E2 - E1) is positive, so the exponent is negative. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -positive/(k T) )\n\nSo when T increases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number (because k T is in the denominator). Wait, no. Wait, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller, so the negative of that is larger (closer to zero). So exp(-x) where x is smaller. So exp(-x) increases as x decreases. So, for example, if x is 10, exp(-10) is ~4.5e-5. If x is 5, exp(-5) is ~0.0067. So when x is smaller (because T is higher), exp(-x) is larger.\n\nSo, when T increases, n2/n1 increases because the exponent is a smaller negative number, so exp(-x) is larger.\n\nSo, if the star's temperature is higher (no spots), n2/n1 is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So n1/n2 is lower when T is lower.\n\nWait, n1/n2 is the inverse of n2/n1. So if n2/n1 is higher when T is higher, then n1/n2 is lower when T is higher.\n\nSo when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). So, when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger. So the exponent in n2/n1 is more negative. So exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ) becomes smaller. So n2/n1 is smaller when T is lower. Thus, n1/n2 is larger when T is lower.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. That's the opposite of what I'm concluding. So I must have made a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe I got the levels mixed up. Let me re-express the problem. The ratio observed is n1/n2, which is decreasing when the star has spots. So when T is lower (5500 K), n1/n2 is lower than when T was higher (6000 K). So the ratio n1/n2 is inversely proportional to T. So when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me re-derive it. Let me write the correct Boltzmann equation.\n\nThe Boltzmann factor for the ratio of populations is:\n\nn_j / n_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i) / (k T) )\n\nSo, if j is level 2 and i is level 1, then:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, if E2 > E1, then the exponent is negative. So n2/n1 is (g2/g1) multiplied by a small number (since exp of a negative number is a fraction).\n\nSo n2/n1 is small, meaning n1 is much larger than n2.\n\nBut when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, because (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So exp(-x) where x is smaller (because T is higher) becomes larger. So n2/n1 increases as T increases.\n\nThus, n1/n2 is 1/(n2/n1). So when T increases, n2/n1 increases, so n1/n2 decreases.\n\nWait, wait. If n2/n1 increases, then n1/n2 would decrease. So when the star has higher T (no spots), n1/n2 is lower. When the star has lower T (spots), n1/n2 is higher.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that would imply that when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. But according to my calculation, when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) is smaller. So n2/n1 is (g2/g1) * small. So n2/n1 is smaller. Thus, n1/n2 is larger when T is lower.\n\nBut the problem states that when the star has spots, n1/n2 decreases. So this seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the same transition, but in the opposite direction. Let me think. If the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5, which is the wavelength emitted when an atom moves from a higher energy level to a lower one. So the energy difference E2 - E1 is hc/\u03bb. So E2 is higher than E1.\n\nBut the Boltzmann equation is about the ratio of the populations. So if E2 is higher, then the ratio n2/n1 would be (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So when T is higher, the exponent is less negative, so the ratio is higher. So n2/n1 increases with T.\n\nBut the question says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Which would mean that n1/n2 is higher when T is lower. Which is the opposite of what the Boltzmann equation suggests.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the ratio as n2/n1. Because the problem states that the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So, if T is lower, n1/n2 decreases. Which would imply that n1/n2 is higher when T is higher.\n\nWhich matches with the Boltzmann equation. Because when T is higher, n2/n1 is higher, so n1/n2 is lower. So when T is higher (no spots), n1/n2 is lower. When T is lower (spots), n1/n2 is higher.\n\nWait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that's the opposite of what the Boltzmann equation suggests. Hmm, maybe I got the ratio the other way around.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of the lower level to the upper level. So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower, and the ratio n1/n2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. So I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me read the problem statement again. \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.\"\n\nSo when the star has spots (lower Teff), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So the ratio is lower when T is lower. So the ratio n1/n2 is higher when T is higher.\n\nWait, that's the opposite of what I thought before. So according to the problem, n1/n2 decreases when T decreases. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, making exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) smaller. So n2/n1 is (g2/g1) * small number. So n2/n1 decreases when T decreases. Thus, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) would increase when T decreases. So according to the problem, when T decreases (spots), n1/n2 decreases, which contradicts the Boltzmann equation.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try to write down the equations.\n\nLet me define level 1 as the lower energy level and level 2 as the higher one. So E1 < E2.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T increases, the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes less negative, so the exponential becomes larger. So n2/n1 increases.\n\nThus, when T is higher (no spots), n2/n1 is higher, so n1/n2 is lower.\n\nWhen T is lower (spots), n2/n1 is lower, so n1/n2 is higher.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So according to the problem, when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, n1/n2 is higher.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. So perhaps the problem is considering the inverse ratio, or maybe I'm mixing up the levels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio n2/n1, but says it decreases when the star has spots. But the question says the ratio n1/n2 decreases.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should think in terms of the Saha equation? No, the Saha equation is about ionization, but the problem is about the same ion in two energy levels, so it's definitely the Boltzmann equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower, but the spots are cooler regions. So perhaps the part of the photosphere that's not covered by spots is hotter. But the problem states that the overall Teff is 5500 K. So I think we can treat the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present.\n\nWait, but the question says the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So the overall photosphere is at a lower temperature. So I think we can model the entire photosphere as being at T_spot = 5500 K.\n\nSo when the star has spots, T is 5500 K, and when it doesn't, T is 6000 K.\n\nThe question is about the ratio n1/n2. So according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is higher, n1/n2 is lower. Because n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me correct myself. The correct form of the Boltzmann equation is:\n\nn_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nSo if i is level 2 and j is level 1, then:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp(less negative) is larger. So n2/n1 increases with T.\n\nThus, when T is higher (no spots), n2/n1 is higher. So n1/n2 is lower.\n\nWhen T is lower (spots), n2/n1 is lower. So n1/n2 is higher.\n\nBut the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So according to the problem, when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, n1/n2 is higher.\n\nThis is a contradiction. So perhaps I have the ratio inverted.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio as n2/n1, but the problem statement says n1/n2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the excitation temperature. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the observed ratio is n1/n2, and the problem says it decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. So the ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nWait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, n1/n2 is higher. So when the star has spots (T=5500 K), n1/n2 is higher than when T=6000 K.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that's not matching. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is the other way around. Maybe the transition is from level 1 to level 2, and when the star has spots, the emission in that line decreases, implying that the population in level 2 is lower. So the ratio n1/n2 would be higher.\n\nWait, but the problem says the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, n1/n2 should be higher. So I'm getting a contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the excitation temperature. The excitation temperature is the temperature that the gas would have to be in LTE to produce the observed level populations. But the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so the excitation temperature is the same as the photospheric temperature.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the two ratios. Let me define R as (n1/n2) at T1 (6000 K) divided by (n1/n2) at T2 (5500 K). So R = [ (n1/n2)_6000 ] / [ (n1/n2)_5500 ]\n\nAccording to the Boltzmann equation, each (n1/n2) is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo R = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 5500) ) ]\n\nThe g factors cancel out.\n\nSo R = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\nCompute the exponent:\n\n1/6000 \u2248 0.00016667\n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.00018182\n\nDifference: 0.00018182 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001515\n\nMultiply by (E2-E1)/(k):\n\nWe have E2-E1 = hc/\u03bb = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 / (1448e-10 * 1.602e-19 J to eV conversion?)\n\nWait, earlier I computed E2-E1 as about 8.56 eV. Let me confirm that.\n\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m.\n\nE = hc/\u03bb = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = (1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (1.448e-7 m) = 1.372e-18 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.566 eV.\n\nSo E2-E1 = 8.566 eV.\n\nk is 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) = 8.566 / (8.617e-5) \u2248 99380 K.\n\nSo the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\nWhich is 99380 * (0.00001515) \u2248 99380 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 approx 1.506.\n\nSo R = exp(1.506) \u2248 e^1.506 \u2248 4.5.\n\nSo the ratio R is about 4.5. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is 4.5 times higher than when it does have spots. Wait, no, because R is [ (n1/n2)_6000 ] / [ (n1/n2)_5500 ].\n\nSo the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is about 4.5.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, (n1/n2)_spots = (n1/n2)_5500 is lower than (n1/n2)_6000. So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = 4.5. So the ratio is higher when T is higher. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher by a factor of about 4.5.\n\nBut the question is, what is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the ratio when no spots is 4.5 times the ratio when it has spots. So the factor is 4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nSo, the problem involves a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure why the Teff would change when spots are present, but I remember that sunspots are cooler regions on the Sun's surface. So when a star has spots, those areas are cooler, which probably lowers the overall effective temperature because the spots emit less light.\n\nNow, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes\u2014comparing when there are no spots to when there are spots. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct factor.\n\nI think this has to do with the Saha equation, which relates the ionization states of atoms to temperature and density. Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of two energy levels of the same ion, Ti I (neutral), so maybe it's more about the Boltzmann equation instead of the Saha equation. The Boltzmann equation deals with the distribution of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) )\n\nWhere:\n- n is the number of particles in each level,\n- g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy) of each level,\n- E is the energy of each level,\n- k is Boltzmann's constant,\n- T is the temperature.\n\nIn this case, the ratio is n1/n2. So rearranging the equation, n1/n2 would be the inverse of that. So,\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )\n\nBut the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Since the spots cause the overall photospheric temperature to drop from 6000 K to 5500 K, I think that the temperature in the photosphere is lower when there are spots. So, the ratio n1/n2 is lower when T is lower. Wait, but how does temperature affect the ratio?\n\nWait, the ratio n1/n2 depends on the exponential term. Let me think. The exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T). If E2 is higher than E1 (since level 2 is a higher energy level), then (E2-E1) is positive. So the exponent is positive. So when T increases, the exponent becomes a smaller number (since denominator is larger), so exp() becomes smaller. Because e^(-x) is smaller when x is larger. Wait no, wait. Let me double-check:\n\nThe exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k T). Let's say E2 > E1, so this is positive. So when T increases, the exponent becomes smaller (because T is in denominator). So exp(positive number) is a positive value. Wait, if the exponent is smaller, then exp(small) is a larger value? No, wait: for example, exp(1) is about 2.718, exp(0.5) is about 1.648, exp(0.1) is about 1.105. So as the exponent decreases (because T increases), the exponential value increases. Wait, no: if T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) becomes smaller. So exp(small) is larger than exp(bigger). For example, when T is high, the exponent is small, so exp(small) is closer to 1. Wait, no: if the exponent is 0.1, exp is 1.105. If the exponent is 0.2, exp is about 1.221. So higher T (lower exponent) makes the exponential term smaller? Wait, no: when T is higher, the denominator is bigger, so the exponent is smaller. So if E2-E1 is positive, then when T increases, the exponent decreases. So the exponential term is e^{(E2-E1)/(k T)} which becomes smaller as T increases. Wait, no. Because if T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) is a smaller positive number, so e^smaller is a larger number? No, because e^0.1 is larger than e^0.05. Wait, no: when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller. So e^{smaller positive} is larger? No, wait, e^0 is 1, e^0.1 is about 1.1, e^0.2 is 1.22, e^0.3 is 1.35. So as T increases, the exponent decreases, so the exponential increases. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think: If T doubles, the exponent is halved. So for T1=5000 K, exponent x1 = (E2-E1)/(k*5000). For T2=6000 K, x2 = x1*(5000/6000) = 5/6 x1. So x2 is smaller than x1. So exp(x2) is larger than exp(x1), because x2 is smaller and positive. So as T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp() increases. That means that n2/n1 would be higher when T is higher. So n1/n2 would be lower when T is higher.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify. The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp() of a smaller positive number is a larger number? No, because as the exponent decreases, the exp() approaches 1 from above. Wait, no. Let me take an example. Suppose E2-E1 = 10 eV (just a number, but in reality, it's in terms of eV, but maybe that's not necessary). So for T = 5000 K:\n\nx = (10) / (k * 5000). Let's compute k in eV/K. Wait, k is about 8.617 \u00d7 10^-5 eV/K. So k*5000 = 8.617e-5 *5e3 = 0.43085 eV. So x = 10 / 0.43085 \u2248 23.2.\n\nWait, that's a very large exponent. So e^23 is a huge number. But wait, this can't be right because in stars, most atoms are in the lower energy states. Maybe my numbers are way off. Alternatively, perhaps E2-E1 is much smaller. Let's think in terms of the wavelength given: the transition corresponds to 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near UV or visible range.\n\nThe energy difference between the levels can be found using E = hc/\u03bb. Let's compute that. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. The speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. Wavelength \u03bb is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = (1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (1.448e-7 m) = approx 1.372e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut we need this in terms of eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nSo E2-E1 is about 8.56 eV. So that's a big energy jump. Hmm, but that would make the Boltzmann factor very small. Because at higher temperatures, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is a big number.\n\nWait, but for T = 5500 K, let's compute (E2-E1)/(k T):\n\nE2-E1 = 8.56 eV.\n\nk is 8.617e-5 eV/K. T is 5500 K.\n\nSo (8.56) / (8.617e-5 * 5500) = 8.56 / (0.473935) \u2248 18.07.\n\nSo the exponent is about 18.07. So exp(18.07) is a huge number. So n2 would be much smaller than n1, because the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp(18), which is about 1e7.7, which is around 5 million. So n2 is much less than n1.\n\nWait, but wait a second. If E2 is higher than E1, and the exponent is positive, then the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which is a large number when (E2-E1) is large relative to k T.\n\nBut when the temperature decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent becomes larger, making exp() even bigger. So n2/n1 would be even larger when T is lower. But the question says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that would imply that n1/n2 is lower when T is lower.\n\nWait, let me think. The ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )^{-1} }.\n\nWait, no, the Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, wait, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Let me get this right. The Boltzmann equation is:\n\nn_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nSo if i is level 2 and j is level 1, then n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSince E2 > E1, (E2 - E1) is positive, so the exponent is negative. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -positive/(k T) )\n\nSo when T increases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number (because k T is in the denominator). Wait, no. Wait, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller, so the negative of that is larger (closer to zero). So exp(-x) where x is smaller. So exp(-x) increases as x decreases. So, for example, if x is 10, exp(-10) is ~4.5e-5. If x is 5, exp(-5) is ~0.0067. So when x is smaller (because T is higher), exp(-x) is larger.\n\nSo, when T increases, n2/n1 increases because the exponent is a smaller negative number, so exp(-x) is larger.\n\nSo, if the star's temperature is higher (no spots), n2/n1 is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So n1/n2 is lower when T is lower.\n\nWait, n1/n2 is the inverse of n2/n1. So if n2/n1 is higher when T is higher, then n1/n2 is lower when T is higher.\n\nSo when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). So, when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger. So the exponent in n2/n1 is more negative. So exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ) becomes smaller. So n2/n1 is smaller when T is lower. Thus, n1/n2 is larger when T is lower.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. That's the opposite of what I'm concluding. So I must have made a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe I got the levels mixed up. Let me re-express the problem. The ratio observed is n1/n2, which is decreasing when the star has spots. So when T is lower (5500 K), n1/n2 is lower than when T was higher (6000 K). So the ratio n1/n2 is inversely proportional to T. So when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me re-derive it. Let me write the correct Boltzmann equation.\n\nThe Boltzmann factor for the ratio of populations is:\n\nn_j / n_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i) / (k T) )\n\nSo, if j is level 2 and i is level 1, then:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, if E2 > E1, then the exponent is negative. So n2/n1 is (g2/g1) multiplied by a small number (since exp of a negative number is a fraction).\n\nSo n2/n1 is small, meaning n1 is much larger than n2.\n\nBut when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, because (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So exp(-x) where x is smaller (because T is higher) becomes larger. So n2/n1 increases as T increases.\n\nThus, n1/n2 is 1/(n2/n1). So when T increases, n2/n1 increases, so n1/n2 decreases.\n\nWait, wait. If n2/n1 increases, then n1/n2 would decrease. So when the star has higher T (no spots), n1/n2 is lower. When the star has lower T (spots), n1/n2 is higher.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that would imply that when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. But according to my calculation, when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) is smaller. So n2/n1 is (g2/g1) * small. So n2/n1 is smaller. Thus, n1/n2 is larger when T is lower.\n\nBut the problem states that when the star has spots, n1/n2 decreases. So this seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the same transition, but in the opposite direction. Let me think. If the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5, which is the wavelength emitted when an atom moves from a higher energy level to a lower one. So the energy difference E2 - E1 is hc/\u03bb. So E2 is higher than E1.\n\nBut the Boltzmann equation is about the ratio of the populations. So if E2 is higher, then the ratio n2/n1 would be (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So when T is higher, the exponent is less negative, so the ratio is higher. So n2/n1 increases with T.\n\nBut the question says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Which would mean that n1/n2 is higher when T is lower. Which is the opposite of what the Boltzmann equation suggests.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the ratio as n2/n1. Because the problem states that the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So, if T is lower, n1/n2 decreases. Which would imply that n1/n2 is higher when T is higher.\n\nWhich matches with the Boltzmann equation. Because when T is higher, n2/n1 is higher, so n1/n2 is lower. So when T is higher (no spots), n1/n2 is lower. When T is lower (spots), n1/n2 is higher.\n\nWait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that's the opposite of what the Boltzmann equation suggests. Hmm, maybe I got the ratio the other way around.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of the lower level to the upper level. So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower, and the ratio n1/n2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. So I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me read the problem statement again. \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.\"\n\nSo when the star has spots (lower Teff), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So the ratio is lower when T is lower. So the ratio n1/n2 is higher when T is higher.\n\nWait, that's the opposite of what I thought before. So according to the problem, n1/n2 decreases when T decreases. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, making exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) smaller. So n2/n1 is (g2/g1) * small number. So n2/n1 decreases when T decreases. Thus, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) would increase when T decreases. So according to the problem, when T decreases (spots), n1/n2 decreases, which contradicts the Boltzmann equation.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try to write down the equations.\n\nLet me define level 1 as the lower energy level and level 2 as the higher one. So E1 < E2.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T increases, the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes less negative, so the exponential becomes larger. So n2/n1 increases.\n\nThus, when T is higher (no spots), n2/n1 is higher, so n1/n2 is lower.\n\nWhen T is lower (spots), n2/n1 is lower, so n1/n2 is higher.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So according to the problem, when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, n1/n2 is higher.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. So perhaps the problem is considering the inverse ratio, or maybe I'm mixing up the levels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio n2/n1, but says it decreases when the star has spots. But the question says the ratio n1/n2 decreases.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should think in terms of the Saha equation? No, the Saha equation is about ionization, but the problem is about the same ion in two energy levels, so it's definitely the Boltzmann equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower, but the spots are cooler regions. So perhaps the part of the photosphere that's not covered by spots is hotter. But the problem states that the overall Teff is 5500 K. So I think we can treat the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present.\n\nWait, but the question says the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So the overall photosphere is at a lower temperature. So I think we can model the entire photosphere as being at T_spot = 5500 K.\n\nSo when the star has spots, T is 5500 K, and when it doesn't, T is 6000 K.\n\nThe question is about the ratio n1/n2. So according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is higher, n1/n2 is lower. Because n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me correct myself. The correct form of the Boltzmann equation is:\n\nn_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nSo if i is level 2 and j is level 1, then:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp(less negative) is larger. So n2/n1 increases with T.\n\nThus, when T is higher (no spots), n2/n1 is higher. So n1/n2 is lower.\n\nWhen T is lower (spots), n2/n1 is lower. So n1/n2 is higher.\n\nBut the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So according to the problem, when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, n1/n2 is higher.\n\nThis is a contradiction. So perhaps I have the ratio inverted.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio as n2/n1, but the problem statement says n1/n2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the excitation temperature. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the observed ratio is n1/n2, and the problem says it decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. So the ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nWait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, n1/n2 is higher. So when the star has spots (T=5500 K), n1/n2 is higher than when T=6000 K.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that's not matching. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is the other way around. Maybe the transition is from level 1 to level 2, and when the star has spots, the emission in that line decreases, implying that the population in level 2 is lower. So the ratio n1/n2 would be higher.\n\nWait, but the problem says the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, n1/n2 should be higher. So I'm getting a contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the excitation temperature. The excitation temperature is the temperature that the gas would have to be in LTE to produce the observed level populations. But the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so the excitation temperature is the same as the photospheric temperature.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the two ratios. Let me define R as (n1/n2) at T1 (6000 K) divided by (n1/n2) at T2 (5500 K). So R = [ (n1/n2)_6000 ] / [ (n1/n2)_5500 ]\n\nAccording to the Boltzmann equation, each (n1/n2) is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo R = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 5500) ) ]\n\nThe g factors cancel out.\n\nSo R = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\nCompute the exponent:\n\n1/6000 \u2248 0.00016667\n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.00018182\n\nDifference: 0.00018182 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001515\n\nMultiply by (E2-E1)/(k):\n\nWe have E2-E1 = hc/\u03bb = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 / (1448e-10 * 1.602e-19 J to eV conversion?)\n\nWait, earlier I computed E2-E1 as about 8.56 eV. Let me confirm that.\n\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m.\n\nE = hc/\u03bb = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = (1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (1.448e-7 m) = 1.372e-18 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.566 eV.\n\nSo E2-E1 = 8.566 eV.\n\nk is 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) = 8.566 / (8.617e-5) \u2248 99380 K.\n\nSo the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\nWhich is 99380 * (0.00001515) \u2248 99380 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 approx 1.506.\n\nSo R = exp(1.506) \u2248 e^1.506 \u2248 4.5.\n\nSo the ratio R is about 4.5. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is 4.5 times higher than when it does have spots. Wait, no, because R is [ (n1/n2)_6000 ] / [ (n1/n2)_5500 ].\n\nSo the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is about 4.5.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, (n1/n2)_spots = (n1/n2)_5500 is lower than (n1/n2)_6000. So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = 4.5. So the ratio is higher when T is higher. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher by a factor of about 4.5.\n\nBut the question is, what is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the ratio when no spots is 4.5 times the ratio when it has spots. So the factor is 4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) using the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann equation relates the populations of two energy levels in thermal equilibrium:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are the populations of levels 1 and 2,\n- \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels,\n- \\(E_2 - E_1\\) is the energy difference between the levels,\n- \\(k\\) is Boltzmann's constant,\n- \\(T\\) is the temperature.\n\nThe problem asks for the factor by which the ratio \\(n_1/n_2\\) changes when the star does not have spots (effective temperature \\(T_1 = 6000 \\, \\text{K}\\)) compared to when it has spots (effective temperature \\(T_2 = 5500 \\, \\text{K}\\)).\n\n### Step 1: Energy Difference Between Levels\nThe transition corresponds to a wavelength of \\(1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\). Using the relation \\(E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\), where \\(h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s}\\), \\(c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}\\), and \\(\\lambda = 1448 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m}\\), the energy difference is:\n\n\\[\nE_2 - E_1 = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34})(3 \\times 10^8)}{1448 \\times 10^{-10}} = 1.372 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}.\n\\]\n\nConverting to electron volts (\\(1 \\, \\text{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}\\)):\n\n\\[\nE_2 - E_1 = \\frac{1.372 \\times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 8.56 \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Ratio of \\(n_1/n_2\\)\nThe ratio \\(n_1/n_2\\) is the inverse of \\(n_2/n_1\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \\frac{g_1}{g_2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\\right).\n\\]\n\nThe statistical weights \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) cancel out when taking the ratio of \\(n_1/n_2\\) at two temperatures. Thus, the ratio of \\(n_1/n_2\\) at \\(T_1 = 6000 \\, \\text{K}\\) to \\(T_2 = 5500 \\, \\text{K}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{T_1}}{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{T_2}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)\\right).\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Exponent\nSubstitute the values:\n- \\(E_2 - E_1 = 8.56 \\, \\text{eV}\\),\n- \\(k = 8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/K}\\),\n- \\(T_1 = 6000 \\, \\text{K}\\),\n- \\(T_2 = 5500 \\, \\text{K}\\).\n\nFirst, calculate \\(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{6000} - \\frac{1}{5500} = 0.00016667 - 0.00018182 = -0.00001515.\n\\]\n\nNow, compute the exponent:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right) = \\frac{8.56}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} \\times (-0.00001515).\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8.56}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 99380 \\, \\text{K}.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n99380 \\times (-0.00001515) \\approx -1.506.\n\\]\n\nThus, the exponent is approximately \\(-1.506\\).\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Ratio\nThe ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{T_1}}{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{T_2}} = \\exp(-1.506) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\exp(1.506)} \\approx \\frac{1}{4.5}.\n\\]\n\nThis means the ratio \\(n_1/n_2\\) decreases by a factor of approximately \\(4.5\\) when the star has spots compared to when it does not.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe factor by which the ratio \\(n_1/n_2\\) changes is approximately **4.5**.\n\nANSWER: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the presence of spots can influence their overall temperature and emission, which in turn affects the ionization states of elements in their atmosphere.\n\nSo, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait\u2014does the spot coverage lower the effective temperature? I think that dark spots are cooler regions, so when a star has spots, the overall brightness (and hence effective temperature) would decrease. So that part makes sense.\n\nThe main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.\n\nWait, the ratio is N1/N2. Without spots, it's higher than when there are spots. So the ratio decreases when there are spots. So the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots.\n\nI remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (N_i/N_j) is given by (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels decreases when spots are present. So, when the star has spots, the Teff is lower. So the temperature in the photosphere when spots are present is lower.\n\nWait, but the effective temperature is an average, but does the photospheric temperature change? Oh, the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the photosphere's temperature is lower, right? Because the spots are cooler, and they cover 40% of the surface, so the overall emission is lower, so the effective temperature is lower.\n\nWait, but the photospheric temperature... Oh, wait, the photosphere is the layer from which the star emits most of its light. So when spots are present, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. So, the temperature T in the photosphere is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when not.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the transition between the energy levels is at 1448 \u00c5. That's about 1448 Angstroms, which is in the near UV or far UV range. I think Titanium has lines in the UV, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nSo, the ratio N1/N2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1. Because if E2 is higher than E1, then higher energy level, and the ratio would depend exponentially on T.\n\nWait, no, the Boltzmann factor is (E_i - E_j)/(k T). So if level 1 is lower than level 2, then E2 > E1, so (E2 - E1) is positive. So the ratio N2/N1 would be proportional to exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), but since the question is about N1/N2, that would be exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) times (g1/g2).\n\nWait, no. Let me get this right. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio N_i/N_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nSo, for two levels, say level 1 is lower energy than level 2, then E2 > E1. So E_i is E2, E_j is E1. So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, no, the ratio N_i/N_j is for the same element. So if i is level 2 and j is level 1, then N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the observed ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, the temperature is lower (5500 K), and N1/N2 is lower. So, without spots, T is 6000 K, and the ratio is higher.\n\nWait, but let's think: the ratio is N1/N2. So, if T decreases, what happens to this ratio?\n\nLooking at the formula, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nAssuming that E2 > E1, so (E2-E1) is positive.\n\nSo, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponential term is smaller. So N1/N2 would be smaller at higher T.\n\nWait, let me take an example. Suppose E2-E1 is a positive number, say delta E.\n\nAt higher T, delta E/(k T) is smaller. So exp(delta E/(k T)) is larger when T is smaller.\n\nWait, because delta E/(k T) is bigger when T is smaller. So exp(delta E/(k T)) is bigger when T is smaller.\n\nSo, N1/N2 is proportional to exp(delta E/(k T)). So when T decreases, N1/N2 increases. But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That would mean when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower. But according to our earlier analysis, N1/N2 should increase when T decreases. Hmm, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, maybe I got the ratio backwards. The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower, the ratio is lower.\n\nSo, what's the ratio when T is lower?\n\nIf N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, as T decreases, the exponent becomes larger (since denominator is smaller), so exp increases, so N1/N2 increases. But according to the problem, when T is lower, the ratio is lower. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I got the levels mixed up. Maybe E1 is higher than E2.\n\nWait, maybe level 2 is lower than level 1. So E1 > E2. Then, (E2-E1) would be negative. So the exponent becomes (E2-E1)/(k T) which is negative. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo when E1 > E2, so (E1-E2) is positive, then N1/N2 is proportional to exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exp term is larger. So N1/N2 increases with T.\n\nBut in the problem, when T decreases (spots present), N1/N2 decreases. So this aligns. So that suggests that level 1 is higher energy than level 2. Because then, N1/N2 is proportional to exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T) ). So when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, so N1/N2 is smaller.\n\nWait, let's think: if E1 > E2, then (E2-E1) is negative. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative, so exp(negative) is a small number. But if the temperature is lower, then (E2-E1)/(k T) is more negative, so exp is even smaller. So N1/N2 would be (g1/g2)*exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which would be (g1/g2)*exp( negative ), which is a small number. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exp becomes smaller, making N1/N2 smaller. Which aligns with the problem statement: ratio decreases when T is lower.\n\nSo, that makes sense. So E1 > E2.\n\nSo, the ratio N1/N2 without spots is (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) )\n\nAnd with spots: (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_spots) )\n\nSo the factor is [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_spots) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_no_spots - 1/T_spots) ) )\n\nWait, that's because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So:\n\nexp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a - b) = exp( (a - b) )\n\nIn this case, a is (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots), and b is (E2-E1)/(k T_spots).\n\nSo a - b = (E2-E1)/(k) [ (1/T_no_spots) - (1/T_spots) ]\n\nHmm, but since E2-E1 is negative (as E1 > E2), this becomes (E2-E1) = - (E1 - E2), so the expression becomes:\n\nexp( [ - (E1-E2) ] / k [ (1/T_no_spots) - (1/T_spots) ] )\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nexp( (E1-E2)/k (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) )\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step.\n\nLet me denote delta E = E1 - E2 (since E1 > E2, delta E is positive).\n\nSo (E2-E1) = -delta E.\n\nSo the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( (-delta E)/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is the same as exp( delta E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBecause (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative, so with the negative sign, it becomes (1/T2 -1/T1).\n\nSo, the factor is exp( (delta E)/(k) (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) )\n\nBecause T1 is the temperature when there are no spots (6000 K), and T2 is when there are spots (5500 K).\n\nSo, let's compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 1/5500 - 1/6000.\n\nCalculate that: 1/5500 \u2248 1.818e-4, 1/6000 \u2248 1.667e-4. The difference is about 0.151e-4 \u2248 1.51e-5.\n\nSo, (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) \u2248 1.51e-5 (K^-1).\n\nNow, delta E is the energy difference between the two levels. But wait, how do I find delta E? The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. So the energy of the photon emitted during this transition is E = hc/lambda.\n\nh is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and lambda is 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 m.\n\nSo E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = let's compute that.\n\n6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.\n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = (1.9878 / 1448) * 1e-15 J.\n\n1.9878 / 1448 \u2248 0.001373, so E \u2248 0.001373e-15 J = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nBut wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to find E in eV:\n\nE = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, that seems high for a Ti transition. Titanium has several ionization stages, but neutral Ti typically has transitions in the UV range. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, 1448 Angstroms is about 145 nm, which is in the UV. So for a transition of Ti I (neutral), that's possible.\n\nWait, but let's compute E again.\n\nCompute E = hc / lambda.\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nlambda = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nHmm, okay. So delta E is about 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, but wait: when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon with energy delta E = E_high - E_low. So if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, and the photon has energy 8.57 eV, then E1 (level 1) is higher than E2 (level 2) by 8.57 eV.\n\nSo delta E = E1 - E2 = 8.57 eV.\n\nSo now, let's plug everything into the factor.\n\nFactor = exp( (delta E) / (k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) )\n\nWe have delta E = 8.57 eV.\n\nk is Boltzmann's constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV / K.\n\nSo delta E / k = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) \u2248 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 99,400 K.\n\nWait, 8.57 / 8.617e-5 is approximately 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\n8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 * (1 / 8.617e-5) = 8.57 * (1.16e4) \u2248 8.57 * 11600 \u2248 99,412 \u2248 ~1e5 K.\n\nSo, delta E / k \u2248 1e5 K.\n\nNext, (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1.\n\nCompute that:\n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818\n\n1/6000 \u2248 0.000166667\n\nDifference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 K^-1.\n\nSo (delta E / k ) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) = 1e5 K * 0.000015151 (1/K) ) = 1e5 * 1.5151e-5 \u2248 1.5151.\n\nWait, 1e5 * 1.5151e-5 = (1e5) * (1.5151e-5) )= 1.5151.\n\nSo, the exponent is approximately 1.5151.\n\nSo, the factor is exp(1.5151) \u2248 e^1.5151.\n\nWe know that e^1 \u2248 2.718, e^1.5 \u2248 4.4817, e^1.6 \u2248 4.953.\n\nWait, 1.5151 is about 1.515. Let's compute e^1.515.\n\nI can approximate it as follows: e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^0.015 is approximately 1.0151.\n\nSo e^1.515 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.0151 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.015 \u2248 4.547.\n\nWait, another way: 1.515 is approximately 1.5 + 0.015.\n\nSo, e^1.5 is ~4.4817, e^0.015 is approximately 1 + 0.015 + (0.015)^2/2 \u2248 1.0151125.\n\nSo, 4.4817 * 1.0151125 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.015 = 4.4817 + 4.4817 * 0.015.\n\n4.4817 * 0.015 \u2248 0.0672255.

Because e^1.504 \u2248 4.5.\n\nWait, e^1.504 is about 4.5? Let me compute.\n\ne^1.5 = 4.4817.\n\ne^1.504 = e^(1.5 + 0.004) = e^1.5 * e^0.004 \u2248 4.4817 * (1 + 0.004 + 0.004^2/2) \u2248 4.4817 * (1.004008) \u2248 4.4817 * 1.004 \u2248 4.4817 + (4.4817 *0.004) = 4.4817 + 0.0179268 \u2248 4.4996.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find e^1.5151.\n\nWait, 1.5151 is 1.5 + 0.0151.\n\ne^1.5151 = e^1.5 * e^0.0151 \u2248 4.4817 * (1 + 0.0151 + (0.0151)^2/2) )\n\nCompute e^0.0151:\n\nApproximate using e^x \u2248 1 + x + x\u00b2/2 for small x.\n\nx = 0.0151\n\nx\u00b2 = 0.000228.\n\nSo, e^0.0151 \u2248 1 + 0.0151 + 0.000228/2 = 1.0151 + 0.000114 = 1.015214.\n\nSo, e^1.5151 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.015214 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.0152.\n\nCompute that: 4.4817 * 1.0152.\n\nWell, 4.4817 * 1 = 4.4817.\n\n4.4817 * 0.0152 = ?\n\n0.01 *4.4817 = 0.044817.\n\n0.0052 *4.4817= 0.023304.\n\nSo total 0.044817 + 0.023304 = 0.068121.\n\nSo 4.4817 + 0.068121 = 4.5498.\n\nSo, approximately 4.55.\n\nSo, the factor is about 4.55.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations for any possible mistakes.\n\nWait, delta E was calculated as 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, E = hc/lambda.\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J s.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\nlambda = 1448e-10 m.\n\nSo, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J.\n\nConvert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo, 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 8.57 eV. That's correct.\n\nThen, delta E / k = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) \u2248 8.57 / 8.617e-5 \u2248 99,400 K.\n\nWait, 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 99,400 K.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\n(1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(3.3e7) = 5e2 / 3.3e7 = 5/(3.3e4) \u2248 1.515e-5 K^-1.\n\nWait, 500/(5500*6000) = 500/(3.3e7) = 5/(3.3e5) \u2248 1.515e-5. Yes.\n\nThen, delta E/(k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) = 99400 K * 1.515e-5 (1/K) ) = 99400 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 1.506.\n\nWait, 99400 * 1.515e-5 = 99400 * 0.00001515 \u2248 99400 * 1.515e-5.\n\nLet me compute 99400 * 1.515e-5:\n\n99400 = 9.94e4.\n\n9.94e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.94 * 1.515 * 1e-1 = 9.94 * 1.515 * 0.1.\n\nCompute 9.94 *1.515: approx 15.06.\n\nMultiply by 0.1: 1.506.\n\nSo, the exponent is approximately 1.506.\n\nSo, exp(1.506) is e^1.506 \u2248 4.5.\n\nBecause e^1.5 is about 4.4817, and e^1.506 is a bit more.\n\nWait, e^1.506 = e^(1.5 + 0.006) = e^1.5 * e^0.006.\n\ne^0.006 \u2248 1 + 0.006 + (0.006)^2/2 = 1.006 + 0.000018 \u2248 1.006018.\n\nSo, 4.4817 * 1.006018 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.006 \u2248 4.4817 + (4.4817 * 0.006) \u2248 4.4817 + 0.0269 \u2248 4.5086.\n\nSo, approximately 4.51. So, the factor is about 4.5, which matches option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the presence of spots can influence their overall temperature and emission, which in turn affects the ionization states of elements in their atmosphere.\n\nSo, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait\u2014does the spot coverage lower the effective temperature? I think that dark spots are cooler regions, so when a star has spots, the overall brightness (and hence effective temperature) would decrease. So that part makes sense.\n\nThe main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.\n\nWait, the ratio is N1/N2. Without spots, it's higher than when there are spots. So the ratio decreases when there are spots. So the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots.\n\nI remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (N_i/N_j) is given by (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels decreases when spots are present. So, when the star has spots, the Teff is lower. So the temperature in the photosphere when spots are present is lower.\n\nWait, but the effective temperature is an average, but does the photospheric temperature change? Oh, the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the photosphere's temperature is lower, right? Because the spots are cooler, and they cover 40% of the surface, so the overall emission is lower, so the effective temperature is lower.\n\nWait, but the photospheric temperature... Oh, wait, the photosphere is the layer from which the star emits most of its light. So when spots are present, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. So, the temperature T in the photosphere is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when not.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the transition between the energy levels is at 1448 \u00c5. That's about 1448 Angstroms, which is in the near UV or far UV range. I think Titanium has lines in the UV, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nSo, the ratio N1/N2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1. Because if E2 is higher than E1, then higher energy level, and the ratio would depend exponentially on T.\n\nWait, no, the Boltzmann factor is (E_i - E_j)/(k T). So if level 1 is lower than level 2, then E2 > E1, so (E2 - E1) is positive. So the ratio N2/N1 would be proportional to exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), but since the question is about N1/N2, that would be exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) times (g1/g2).\n\nWait, no. Let me get this right. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio N_i/N_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )\n\nSo, for two levels, say level 1 is lower energy than level 2, then E2 > E1. So E_i is E2, E_j is E1. So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, no, the ratio N_i/N_j is for the same element. So if i is level 2 and j is level 1, then N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the observed ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, the temperature is lower (5500 K), and N1/N2 is lower. So, without spots, T is 6000 K, and the ratio is higher.\n\nWait, but let's think: the ratio is N1/N2. So, if T decreases, what happens to this ratio?\n\nLooking at the formula, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nAssuming that E2 > E1, so (E2-E1) is positive.\n\nSo, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponential term is smaller. So N1/N2 would be smaller at higher T.\n\nWait, let me take an example. Suppose E2-E1 is a positive number, say delta E.\n\nAt higher T, delta E/(k T) is smaller. So exp(delta E/(k T)) is larger when T is smaller.\n\nWait, because delta E/(k T) is bigger when T is smaller. So exp(delta E/(k T)) is bigger when T is smaller.\n\nSo, N1/N2 is proportional to exp(delta E/(k T)). So when T decreases, N1/N2 increases. But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That would mean when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower. But according to our earlier analysis, N1/N2 should increase when T decreases. Hmm, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, maybe I got the ratio backwards. The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower, the ratio is lower.\n\nSo, what's the ratio when T is lower?\n\nIf N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, as T decreases, the exponent becomes larger (since denominator is smaller), so exp increases, so N1/N2 increases. But according to the problem, when T is lower, the ratio is lower. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I got the levels mixed up. Maybe E1 is higher than E2.\n\nWait, maybe level 2 is lower than level 1. So E1 > E2. Then, (E2-E1) would be negative. So the exponent becomes (E2-E1)/(k T) which is negative. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo when E1 > E2, so (E1-E2) is positive, then N1/N2 is proportional to exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exp term is larger. So N1/N2 increases with T.\n\nBut in the problem, when T decreases (spots present), N1/N2 decreases. So this aligns. So that suggests that level 1 is higher energy than level 2. Because then, N1/N2 is proportional to exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T) ). So when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, so N1/N2 is smaller.\n\nWait, let's think: if E1 > E2, then (E2-E1) is negative. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative, so exp(negative) is a small number. But if the temperature is lower, then (E2-E1)/(k T) is more negative, so exp is even smaller. So N1/N2 would be (g1/g2)*exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which would be (g1/g2)*exp( negative ), which is a small number. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exp becomes smaller, making N1/N2 smaller. Which aligns with the problem statement: ratio decreases when T is lower.\n\nSo, that makes sense. So E1 > E2.\n\nSo, the ratio N1/N2 without spots is (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) )\n\nAnd with spots: (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_spots) )\n\nSo the factor is [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_spots) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_no_spots - 1/T_spots) ) )\n\nWait, that's because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So:\n\nexp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a - b) = exp( (a - b) )\n\nIn this case, a is (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots), and b is (E2-E1)/(k T_spots).\n\nSo a - b = (E2-E1)/(k) [ (1/T_no_spots) - (1/T_spots) ]\n\nHmm, but since E2-E1 is negative (as E1 > E2), this becomes (E2-E1) = - (E1 - E2), so the expression becomes:\n\nexp( [ - (E1-E2) ] / k [ (1/T_no_spots) - (1/T_spots) ] )\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nexp( (E1-E2)/k (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) )\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step.\n\nLet me denote delta E = E1 - E2 (since E1 > E2, delta E is positive).\n\nSo (E2-E1) = -delta E.\n\nSo the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( (-delta E)/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is the same as exp( delta E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBecause (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative, so with the negative sign, it becomes (1/T2 -1/T1).\n\nSo, the factor is exp( (delta E)/(k) (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) )\n\nBecause T1 is the temperature when there are no spots (6000 K), and T2 is when there are spots (5500 K).\n\nSo, let's compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 1/5500 - 1/6000.\n\nCalculate that: 1/5500 \u2248 1.818e-4, 1/6000 \u2248 1.667e-4. The difference is about 0.151e-4 \u2248 1.51e-5.\n\nSo, (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) \u2248 1.51e-5 (K^-1).\n\nNow, delta E is the energy difference between the two levels. But wait, how do I find delta E? The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. So the energy of the photon emitted during this transition is E = hc/lambda.\n\nh is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and lambda is 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 m.\n\nSo E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = let's compute that.\n\n6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.\n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = (1.9878 / 1448) * 1e-15 J.\n\n1.9878 / 1448 \u2248 0.001373, so E \u2248 0.001373e-15 J = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nBut wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to find E in eV:\n\nE = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, that seems high for a Ti transition. Titanium has several ionization stages, but neutral Ti typically has transitions in the UV range. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, 1448 Angstroms is about 145 nm, which is in the UV. So for a transition of Ti I (neutral), that's possible.\n\nWait, but let's compute E again.\n\nCompute E = hc / lambda.\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nlambda = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nHmm, okay. So delta E is about 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, but wait: when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon with energy delta E = E_high - E_low. So if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, and the photon has energy 8.57 eV, then E1 (level 1) is higher than E2 (level 2) by 8.57 eV.\n\nSo delta E = E1 - E2 = 8.57 eV.\n\nSo now, let's plug everything into the factor.\n\nFactor = exp( (delta E) / (k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) )\n\nWe have delta E = 8.57 eV.\n\nk is Boltzmann's constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV / K.\n\nSo delta E / k = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) \u2248 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 99,400 K.\n\nWait, 8.57 / 8.617e-5 is approximately 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\n8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 * (1 / 8.617e-5) = 8.57 * (1.16e4) \u2248 8.57 * 11600 \u2248 99,412 \u2248 ~1e5 K.\n\nSo, delta E / k \u2248 1e5 K.\n\nNext, (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1.\n\nCompute that:\n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818\n\n1/6000 \u2248 0.000166667\n\nDifference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 K^-1.\n\nSo (delta E / k ) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) = 1e5 K * 0.000015151 (1/K) ) = 1e5 * 1.5151e-5 \u2248 1.5151.\n\nWait, 1e5 * 1.5151e-5 = (1e5) * (1.5151e-5) )= 1.5151.\n\nSo, the exponent is approximately 1.5151.\n\nSo, the factor is exp(1.5151) \u2248 e^1.5151.\n\nWe know that e^1 \u2248 2.718, e^1.5 \u2248 4.4817, e^1.6 \u2248 4.953.\n\nWait, 1.5151 is about 1.515. Let's compute e^1.515.\n\nI can approximate it as follows: e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^0.015 is approximately 1.0151.\n\nSo e^1.515 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.0151 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.015 \u2248 4.547.\n\nWait, another way: 1.515 is approximately 1.5 + 0.015.\n\nSo, e^1.5 is ~4.4817, e^0.015 is approximately 1 + 0.015 + (0.015)^2/2 \u2248 1.0151125.\n\nSo, 4.4817 * 1.0151125 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.015 = 4.4817 + 4.4817 * 0.015.\n\n4.4817 * 0.015 \u2248 0.0672255. So 4.4817 + 0.0672 \u2248 4.5489.\n\nSo, approximately 4.55.\n\nWait, but let me calculate it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator approach: 1.5151.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series or known values.\n\nAlternatively, note that ln(4.5) is about 1.504. Because e^1.504 \u2248 4.5.\n\nWait, e^1.504 is about 4.5? Let me compute.\n\ne^1.5 = 4.4817.\n\ne^1.504 = e^(1.5 + 0.004) = e^1.5 * e^0.004 \u2248 4.4817 * (1 + 0.004 + 0.004^2/2) \u2248 4.4817 * (1.004008) \u2248 4.4817 * 1.004 \u2248 4.4817 + (4.4817 *0.004) = 4.4817 + 0.0179268 \u2248 4.4996.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find e^1.5151.\n\nWait, 1.5151 is 1.5 + 0.0151.\n\ne^1.5151 = e^1.5 * e^0.0151 \u2248 4.4817 * (1 + 0.0151 + (0.0151)^2/2) )\n\nCompute e^0.0151:\n\nApproximate using e^x \u2248 1 + x + x\u00b2/2 for small x.\n\nx = 0.0151\n\nx\u00b2 = 0.000228.\n\nSo, e^0.0151 \u2248 1 + 0.0151 + 0.000228/2 = 1.0151 + 0.000114 = 1.015214.\n\nSo, e^1.5151 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.015214 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.0152.\n\nCompute that: 4.4817 * 1.0152.\n\nWell, 4.4817 * 1 = 4.4817.\n\n4.4817 * 0.0152 = ?\n\n0.01 *4.4817 = 0.044817.\n\n0.0052 *4.4817= 0.023304.\n\nSo total 0.044817 + 0.023304 = 0.068121.\n\nSo 4.4817 + 0.068121 = 4.5498.\n\nSo, approximately 4.55.\n\nSo, the factor is about 4.55.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations for any possible mistakes.\n\nWait, delta E was calculated as 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, E = hc/lambda.\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J s.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\nlambda = 1448e-10 m.\n\nSo, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J.\n\nConvert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo, 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 8.57 eV. That's correct.\n\nThen, delta E / k = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) \u2248 8.57 / 8.617e-5 \u2248 99,400 K.\n\nWait, 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 99,400 K.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\n(1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(3.3e7) = 5e2 / 3.3e7 = 5/(3.3e4) \u2248 1.515e-5 K^-1.\n\nWait, 500/(5500*6000) = 500/(3.3e7) = 5/(3.3e5) \u2248 1.515e-5. Yes.\n\nThen, delta E/(k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) = 99400 K * 1.515e-5 (1/K) ) = 99400 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 1.506.\n\nWait, 99400 * 1.515e-5 = 99400 * 0.00001515 \u2248 99400 * 1.515e-5.\n\nLet me compute 99400 * 1.515e-5:\n\n99400 = 9.94e4.\n\n9.94e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.94 * 1.515 * 1e-1 = 9.94 * 1.515 * 0.1.\n\nCompute 9.94 *1.515: approx 15.06.\n\nMultiply by 0.1: 1.506.\n\nSo, the exponent is approximately 1.506.\n\nSo, exp(1.506) is e^1.506 \u2248 4.5.\n\nBecause e^1.5 is about 4.4817, and e^1.506 is a bit more.\n\nWait, e^1.506 = e^(1.5 + 0.006) = e^1.5 * e^0.006.\n\ne^0.006 \u2248 1 + 0.006 + (0.006)^2/2 = 1.006 + 0.000018 \u2248 1.006018.\n\nSo, 4.4817 * 1.006018 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.006 \u2248 4.4817 + (4.4817 * 0.006) \u2248 4.4817 + 0.0269 \u2248 4.5086.\n\nSo, approximately 4.51. So, the factor is about 4.5, which matches option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having 40% of its surface covered by spots (Teff = 5500 K).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nSo, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When it doesn't have dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes\u2014so, ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots.\n\nHmm. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star is spotted, the ratio n2/n1 is lower than when it's unspotted. So, we're looking for (n2/n1)_unspotted divided by (n2/n1)_spotted.\n\nBut wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. The ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two levels is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, the ratio when spotted is lower than when unspotted. So, the factor would be (unspotted ratio) / (spotted ratio).\n\nWait, but the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, the unspotted ratio is higher than the spotted ratio. So the factor is (unspotted ratio) / (spotted ratio) = something bigger than 1.\n\nThe ratio depends on temperature because the exponential term is T-dependent. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near UV or visible range. But the exact wavelength might relate to the energy difference between the two levels. Let me think about how to compute the ratio.\n\nWait, the transition wavelength \u03bb is given as approximately 1448 \u00c5. Since energy E is related to wavelength by E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light. So the energy difference between levels 2 and 1 is E2 - E1 = hc / \u03bb.\n\nSo, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is (E2 - E1)/(kT) = hc/(\u03bb k T).\n\nWait, but actually, since E2 is higher than E1 (assuming level 2 is higher), then E2 - E1 = hc/\u03bb. So the exponent is positive.\n\nBut when the temperature decreases, the exponential term becomes larger because the denominator is smaller. So, exp(- (E2-E1)/(k T)) = exp(- (hc)/(\u03bb k T)) ) which is exp( - (some positive number) / T ). So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, and the whole exponential becomes smaller. So the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which would decrease as T decreases.\n\nWait, but wait: the ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So if the temperature drops, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots and the overall T drops, the ratio of n2/n1 decreases. That's consistent with the problem statement.\n\nSo when the star has spots, Teff is lower (5500 K vs 6000 K), so the ratio n2/n1 is lower. So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000K / (n2/n1)_5500K.\n\nBut wait, the ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( - \u0394E/(k T) ), where \u0394E = E2 - E1 = hc/(\u03bb). So the ratio is proportional to exp(-\u0394E/(k T)).\n\nSo the factor we're looking for is [exp(-\u0394E/(k T_un))]/[exp(-\u0394E/(k T_sp)))] = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T_sp - 1/T_un) )\n\nWait, because:\n\nexp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a - b). So in our case, a is -\u0394E/(k T_un), and b is -\u0394E/(k T_sp). So a - b = [ -\u0394E/(k T_un) ] - [ -\u0394E/(k T_sp) ] = \u0394E/(k) (1/T_sp - 1/T_un).\n\nWait, no.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nSo, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When it doesn't have dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes\u2014so, ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots.\n\nHmm. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star is spotted, the ratio n2/n1 is lower than when it's unspotted. So, we're looking for (n2/n1)_unspotted divided by (n2/n1)_spotted.\n\nBut wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. The ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two levels is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, the ratio when spotted is lower than when unspotted. So, the factor would be (unspotted ratio) / (spotted ratio).\n\nWait, but the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, the unspotted ratio is higher than the spotted ratio. So the factor is (unspotted ratio) / (spotted ratio) = something bigger than 1.\n\nThe ratio depends on temperature because the exponential term is T-dependent. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near UV or visible range. But the exact wavelength might relate to the energy difference between the two levels. Let me think about how to compute the ratio.\n\nWait, the transition wavelength \u03bb is given as approximately 1448 \u00c5. Since energy E is related to wavelength by E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light. So the energy difference between levels 2 and 1 is E2 - E1 = hc / \u03bb.\n\nSo, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is (E2 - E1)/(kT) = hc/(\u03bb k T).\n\nWait, but actually, since E2 is higher than E1 (assuming level 2 is higher), then E2 - E1 = hc/\u03bb. So the exponent is positive.\n\nBut when the temperature decreases, the exponential term becomes larger because the denominator is smaller. So, exp(- (E2-E1)/(k T)) = exp(- (hc)/(\u03bb k T)) ) which is exp( - (some positive number) / T ). So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, and the whole exponential becomes smaller. So the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which would decrease as T decreases.\n\nWait, but wait: the ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So if the temperature drops, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots and the overall T drops, the ratio of n2/n1 decreases. That's consistent with the problem statement.\n\nSo when the star has spots, Teff is lower (5500 K vs 6000 K), so the ratio n2/n1 is lower. So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000K / (n2/n1)_5500K.\n\nBut wait, the ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( - \u0394E/(k T) ), where \u0394E = E2 - E1 = hc/(\u03bb). So the ratio is proportional to exp(-\u0394E/(k T)).\n\nSo the factor we're looking for is [exp(-\u0394E/(k T_un))]/[exp(-\u0394E/(k T_sp)))] = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T_sp - 1/T_un) )\n\nWait, because:\n\nexp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a - b). So in our case, a is -\u0394E/(k T_un), and b is -\u0394E/(k T_sp). So a - b = [ -\u0394E/(k T_un) ] - [ -\u0394E/(k T_sp) ] = \u0394E/(k) (1/T_sp - 1/T_un).\n\nWait, no. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nLet me write it as (n2/n1)_un / (n2/n1)_sp = [exp(-\u0394E/(k T_un))]/[exp(-\u0394E/(k T_sp))] )\n\nWhich is exp[ (-\u0394E/(k T_un)) + (\u0394E/(k T_sp)) ) ] = exp[ \u0394E/(k) (1/T_sp - 1/T_un) ) ]\n\nAlternatively, factoring out \u0394E/(k), that's exp[ (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T_sp - 1/T_un) ) ]\n\nWait, but 1/T_sp is larger than 1/T_un since T_sp (5500) is less than T_un (6000). So 1/5500 is larger than 1/6000.\n\nSo the exponent is positive, so the factor is greater than 1, which makes sense because the ratio when unspotted is higher.\n\nSo now, I need to compute this factor. Let's compute the exponent.\n\nFirst, compute \u0394E/(k) = (hc)/(\u03bb k) = (hc)/(\u03bb k) = (hc)/(\u03bb k) \u2192 let's compute this value.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent as (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T_sp - 1/T_un) = (hc/(\u03bb k)) (1/(5500) - 1/(6000)).\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nCompute the terms:\n\nh = Planck's constant = 6.62607015e-34 J s\nc = speed of light \u2248 2.99792458e8 m/s\nk = Boltzmann constant = 1.380649e-23 J/K\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m.\n\nCompute hc/(\u03bb k):\n\nLet's compute hc/(\u03bb k) first.\n\nh c = 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 \u2248 1.98644586e-25 J m.\n\nDivide by \u03bb (1448e-10 m) and k (1.380649e-23 J/K):\n\nhc/(\u03bb k) = (1.98644586e-25) / (1448e-10 * 1.380649e-23 )\n\nCompute denominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.380649e-23 J/K = 1448e-10 * 1.380649e-23 \u2248 2.003e-26 J m/K.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that:\n\n1448e-10 m is 1.448e-7 m.\n\nMultiply by 1.380649e-23 J/K: 1.448e-7 * 1.380649e-23 \u2248 2.003e-30 J m/K.\n\nWait, no: 1.448e-7 * 1.380649e-23 = (1.448 * 1.380649) * 1e-7 * 1e-23) = (2.003...) * 1e-30.\n\nSo denominator is 2.003e-30 J m/K.\n\nSo hc/(lambda k) = (1.98644586e-25 J m) / (2.003e-30 J m/K) ) = (1.98644586e-25 / 2.003e-30 ) K.\n\nCompute that: 1.98644586e-25 / 2.003e-30 \u2248 (1.98644586 / 2.003) )e5 \u2248 (approx 0.991) * 1e5 \u2248 9.91e4 K.\n\nWait, that's approximately 99,100 K.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. I remember that when stars have spots, their overall brightness can change, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nSo the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature drops to 5500 K. Wait, but why does the effective temperature decrease when spots cover part of the surface? Oh right, because the spots are cooler, so the overall emission is less, making the effective temp lower.\n\nThe main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher, and when it has spots, it's lower. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. The options are A to D.\n\nI think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The Boltzmann factor is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where E is the energy difference between levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(kT)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels. If the ratio decreases, that means n1/n2 is getting smaller. So when the temperature goes down, the ratio might change.\n\nWait, but wait. The ratio is (n1/n2), right? Let's say E2 is higher than E1. So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-\u0394E/(kT)) increases, making the ratio n1/n2 larger. So if the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio decreases. That makes sense with the question, because when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases.\n\nSo the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. We need to find (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nSince both situations are in LTE, we can apply the Boltzmann equation for both.\n\nLet me denote the ratio without spots as R1 and with spots as R2. We need R1/R2.\n\nEach ratio is R = (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)).\n\nSo R1 = (g1/g2) * exp(-\u0394E/(k T1))\nR2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-\u0394E/(k T2))\n\nThe ratio R1/R2 = [exp(-\u0394E/(k T1))] / [exp(-\u0394E/(k T2))] ) = exp[ (\u0394E/k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ]\n\nWait, because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So:\n\nexp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a - b). So in this case, a is -\u0394E/(k T1) and b is -\u0394E/(k T2). So a - b is (-\u0394E/(k T1)) - (-\u0394E/(k T2)) )= \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). Because T1 is higher than T2, since T1 is 6000 K and T2 is 5500 K.\n\nWait, let's compute T1 and T2. T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nSo (1/T2 - 1/T1) is (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) )= 500/(3,300,000) )= 1/6600 \u2248 0.0001515.\n\nSo the exponent becomes (\u0394E/k) * (1/6600).\n\nBut wait, what is \u0394E? The energy difference between the two levels. Since the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5, we can calculate \u0394E using the relation E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nLet me compute that. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. Wavelength \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo \u0394E = hc/(\u03bb) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) = approximately 1.372e-18 J.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately.\n\nh = 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s\nc = 299792458 m/s \u2248 3e8 m/s for approximation.\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nNow, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K.\n\nSo \u0394E/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) \u2248 (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 \u2248 approximately 1e5 K (since 1.373/1.38 is about 0.995, so around 99500 K).\n\nSo \u0394E/(k) \u2248 99500 K.\n\nNow, back to the exponent: (\u0394E/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) \u2248 99500 K * (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^{-1}.\n\nWait, let's compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 1/66,000 \u2248 0.00001515.\n\nSo exponent is 99500 * (0.00001515) \u2248 99500 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n99500 * 1.515e-5 = (99500 * 1.515) * 1e-5.\n\n99500 * 1.515 = Let's compute 100,000 *1.515 = 151,500. Subtract 500 *1.515=757.5 \u2192 151500 -757.5 = 150742.5.\n\nMultiply by 1e-5: 150742.5e-5 = 15.07425.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 15.074. So the ratio R1/R2 is exp(15.074).\n\nWait, exp(15) is a very large number. Let me compute that.\n\nI know that ln(2) \u22480.693, so exp(15) \u2248 e^15. Let me think: e^10 is about 22026. e^5 is about 148.413. So e^15 = e^10 * e^5 \u2248 22026 * 148.413 \u2248 around 3.269e6.\n\nBut wait, our exponent is 15.074. So let's compute that. e^15.074 \u2248 e^15 * e^0.074.\n\ne^0.074 \u2248 1 + 0.074 + (0.074)^2/2 + ... \u2248 approx 1.0765.\n\nSo e^15.074 \u2248 3.269e6 * 1.0765 \u2248 ~3.52e6.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the options don't go that high. The options are about 1.1, 7.8, 4.5, 2.9.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because this is way bigger than any of the options.\n\nHmm, let me retrace. Maybe I messed up the exponent sign.\n\nWait, the ratio R1/R2 is exp[ (\u0394E/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ].\n\nWait, because R1 is when T is T1=6000 K, and R2 is T=T2=5500 K. So in the exponent, it's [ (\u0394E/k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ].\n\nWait, 1/T2 is 1/5500, and 1/T1 is 1/6000.\n\nSo (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive because 1/5500 > 1/6000.\n\nSo the exponent is (\u0394E/k) * (positive number) \u2192 positive.\n\nSo exp(positive) is a number greater than 1. So R1/R2 is larger than 1, which makes sense since the ratio without spots is higher.\n\nBut wait, the options are much smaller than 3.5e6. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the energy calculation. Let me check the wavelength again.\n\nThe transition is at 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near-ultraviolet or perhaps extreme UV. So the energy is hc/(\u03bb).\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake in calculating E. Let me recalculate that.\n\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448 * 1e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 meters.\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nWait, that's correct. So E is about 1.37e-18 J.\n\nThen \u0394E/(k) = 1.37e-18 / 1.38e-23 \u2248 99500 K.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nWait, so the exponent is (99500) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 99500 * ( (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) )\n\nWhich is 99500 * (500)/(33,000,000) ) \u2192 99500 * (5e2)/(3.3e7) ) \u2192 99500 * (5)/(330000) ) \u2192 99500 * (1)/(66,000) ) \u2248 99500 /66,000 \u2248 1.5075.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.5075.\n\nAh, wait! I think I made a mistake earlier. I think I forgot that (1/5500 - 1/6000) is 500/(5500 * 6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 1/(66,000) \u2248 1.515e-5.\n\nWait, no, 500 / (33,000,000) = 5e2 / 3.3e7 \u2192 5/(3.3e5) ) \u2192 5/(330,000) ) \u2192 approx 1.515e-5.\n\nSo the exponent is (99500) * (1.515e-5) \u2248 99500 * 1.515e-5 = (99500) * 1.515e-5.\n\nHmm, 99500 is 9.95e4. So 9.95e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.95 * 1.515) * 1e-1 = approximately 15.07 * 0.1 = 1.507.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute 9.95 * 1.515.\n\n1.515 * 10 = 15.15. So 1.515 *9.95 = 15.15 - (1.515 *0.05) ) \u2192 15.15 - 0.07575 \u2248 15.07425.\n\nSo 15.07425 * 1e-1 is 1.507425.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.5074. So exp(1.5074) is about what?\n\nI remember that e^1.6 is about 4.953, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.4 is about 4.055, e^1.3 is about 3.669.\n\nWait, let me be more precise. Let me compute e^1.5074.\n\nWe know that e^1.5 is about 4.4817.\n\nLet me compute 1.5074 -1.5 = 0.0074.\n\nSo e^1.5074 = e^1.5 * e^0.0074.\n\ne^0.0074 \u2248 1 + 0.0074 + (0.0074)^2/2 \u2248 1.0074 + 0.00002738 \u2248 1.00742738.\n\nSo e^1.5074 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.007427 \u2248 approximately 4.4817 * 1.0074.\n\nLet me compute that: 4.4817 * 1.0074 = 4.4817 + (4.4817 *0.0074) ) = 4.4817 + 0.03317 \u2248 4.5149.\n\nSo e^1.5074 \u2248 4.515.\n\nSo the ratio R1/R2 is about 4.515. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels. So the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( -\u0394E/(kT) )\n\nWait, but when the star has spots, T is 5500 K, so the exponent is higher (more negative), making (n1/n2) lower. So R1 is (n1/n2) at T=6000 K, R2 at T=5500 K.\n\nSo the factor is R1/R2 = exp( (\u0394E/k)(1/5500 - 1/6000) ) \u2248 4.515, which is about option C.\n\nBut wait, why isn't it higher? Because the exponent was 1.5, which is why the ratio is around 4.5.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C, ~4.5.\n",

So:\n\nexp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a - b). So in this case, a is -\u0394E/(k T1) and b is -\u0394E/(k T2). So a - b is (-\u0394E/(k T1)) - (-\u0394E/(k T2)) )= \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). Because T1 is higher than T2, since T1 is 6000 K and T2 is 5500 K.\n\nWait, let's compute T1 and T2. T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nSo (1/T2 - 1/T1) is (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) )= 500/(3,300,000) )= 1/6600 \u2248 0.0001515.\n\nSo the exponent becomes (\u0394E/k) * (1/6600).\n\nBut wait, what is \u0394E? The energy difference between the two levels. Since the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5, we can calculate \u0394E using the relation E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nLet me compute that. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. Wavelength \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo \u0394E = hc/(\u03bb) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) = approximately 1.372e-18 J.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately.\n\nh = 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s\nc = 299792458 m/s \u2248 3e8 m/s for approximation.\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nNow, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K.\n\nSo \u0394E/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) \u2248 (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 \u2248 approximately 1e5 K (since 1.373/1.38 is about 0.995, so around 99500 K).\n\nSo \u0394E/(k) \u2248 99500 K.\n\nNow, back to the exponent: (\u0394E/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) \u2248 99500 K * (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^{-1}.\n\nWait, let's compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 1/66,000 \u2248 0.00001515.\n\nSo exponent is 99500 * (0.00001515) \u2248 99500 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n99500 * 1.515e-5 = (99500 * 1.515) * 1e-5.\n\n99500 * 1.515 = Let's compute 100,000 *1.515 = 151,500. Subtract 500 *1.515=757.5 \u2192 151500 -757.5 = 150742.5.\n\nMultiply by 1e-5: 150742.5e-5 = 15.07425.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 15.074. So the ratio R1/R2 is exp(15.074).\n\nWait, exp(15) is a very large number. Let me compute that.\n\nI know that ln(2) \u22480.693, so exp(15) \u2248 e^15. Let me think: e^10 is about 22026. e^5 is about 148.413. So e^15 = e^10 * e^5 \u2248 22026 * 148.413 \u2248 around 3.269e6.\n\nBut wait, our exponent is 15.074. So let's compute that. e^15.074 \u2248 e^15 * e^0.074.\n\ne^0.074 \u2248 1 + 0.074 + (0.074)^2/2 + ... \u2248 approx 1.0765.\n\nSo e^15.074 \u2248 3.269e6 * 1.0765 \u2248 ~3.52e6.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the options don't go that high. The options are about 1.1, 7.8, 4.5, 2.9.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because this is way bigger than any of the options.\n\nHmm, let me retrace. Maybe I messed up the exponent sign.\n\nWait, the ratio R1/R2 is exp[ (\u0394E/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ].\n\nWait, because R1 is when T is T1=6000 K, and R2 is T=T2=5500 K. So in the exponent, it's [ (\u0394E/k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ].\n\nWait, 1/T2 is 1/5500, and 1/T1 is 1/6000.\n\nSo (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive because 1/5500 > 1/6000.\n\nSo the exponent is (\u0394E/k) * (positive number) \u2192 positive.\n\nSo exp(positive) is a number greater than 1. So R1/R2 is larger than 1, which makes sense since the ratio without spots is higher.\n\nBut wait, the options are much smaller than 3.5e6. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the energy calculation. Let me check the wavelength again.\n\nThe transition is at 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near-ultraviolet or perhaps extreme UV. So the energy is hc/(\u03bb).\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake in calculating E. Let me recalculate that.\n\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448 * 1e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 meters.\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nWait, that's correct. So E is about 1.37e-18 J.\n\nThen \u0394E/(k) = 1.37e-18 / 1.38e-23 \u2248 99500 K.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nWait, so the exponent is (99500) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 99500 * ( (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) )\n\nWhich is 99500 * (500)/(33,000,000) ) \u2192 99500 * (5e2)/(3.3e7) ) \u2192 99500 * (5)/(330000) ) \u2192 99500 * (1)/(66,000) ) \u2248 99500 /66,000 \u2248 1.5075.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.5075.\n\nAh, wait! I think I made a mistake earlier. I think I forgot that (1/5500 - 1/6000) is 500/(5500 * 6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 1/(66,000) \u2248 1.515e-5.\n\nWait, no, 500 / (33,000,000) = 5e2 / 3.3e7 \u2192 5/(3.3e5) ) \u2192 5/(330,000) ) \u2192 approx 1.515e-5.\n\nSo the exponent is (99500) * (1.515e-5) \u2248 99500 * 1.515e-5 = (99500) * 1.515e-5.\n\nHmm, 99500 is 9.95e4. So 9.95e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.95 * 1.515) * 1e-1 = approximately 15.07 * 0.1 = 1.507.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute 9.95 * 1.515.\n\n1.515 * 10 = 15.15. So 1.515 *9.95 = 15.15 - (1.515 *0.05) ) \u2192 15.15 - 0.07575 \u2248 15.07425.\n\nSo 15.07425 * 1e-1 is 1.507425.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.5074. So exp(1.5074) is about what?\n\nI remember that e^1.6 is about 4.953, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.4 is about 4.055, e^1.3 is about 3.669.\n\nWait, let me be more precise. Let me compute e^1.5074.\n\nWe know that e^1.5 is about 4.4817.\n\nLet me compute 1.5074 -1.5 = 0.0074.\n\nSo e^1.5074 = e^1.5 * e^0.0074.\n\ne^0.0074 \u2248 1 + 0.0074 + (0.0074)^2/2 \u2248 1.0074 + 0.00002738 \u2248 1.00742738.\n\nSo e^1.5074 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.007427 \u2248 approximately 4.4817 * 1.0074.\n\nLet me compute that: 4.4817 * 1.0074 = 4.4817 + (4.4817 *0.0074) ) = 4.4817 + 0.03317 \u2248 4.5149.\n\nSo e^1.5074 \u2248 4.515.\n\nSo the ratio R1/R2 is about 4.515. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels. So the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( -\u0394E/(kT) )\n\nWait, but when the star has spots, T is 5500 K, so the exponent is higher (more negative), making (n1/n2) lower. So R1 is (n1/n2) at T=6000 K, R2 at T=5500 K.\n\nSo the factor is R1/R2 = exp( (\u0394E/k)(1/5500 - 1/6000) ) \u2248 4.515, which is about option C.\n\nBut wait, why isn't it higher? Because the exponent was 1.5, which is why the ratio is around 4.5.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C, ~4.5.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \\frac{g_1}{g_2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \\(\\Delta E\\) is the energy difference between the levels, \\(k\\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature. The ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels depends on the temperature \\(T\\). When the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases from \\(T_1 = 6000 \\, \\text{K}\\) to \\(T_2 = 5500 \\, \\text{K}\\), causing the ratio \\((n_1/n_2)\\) to decrease.\n\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right)\\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\(\\Delta E\\)\nThe energy difference \\(\\Delta E\\) corresponds to the transition wavelength \\(\\lambda = 1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\). Using the relation \\(\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\), where \\(h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s}\\), \\(c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}\\), and \\(\\lambda = 1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5} = 1.448 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34})(3 \\times 10^8)}{1.448 \\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 1.373 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute \\(\\Delta E / k\\)\nBoltzmann's constant is \\(k = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}\\). Thus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{1.373 \\times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23}} \\approx 99500 \\, \\text{K}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the exponent\nThe temperature difference term is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} \\approx 1.515 \\times 10^{-5}\n\\]\n\nThus, the exponent becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right) = 99500 \\times 1.515 \\times 10^{-5} \\approx 1.507\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compute the ratio\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\exp(1.507) \\approx 4.515\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots, and the factor by which this ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.\n\nAnswer: C",
