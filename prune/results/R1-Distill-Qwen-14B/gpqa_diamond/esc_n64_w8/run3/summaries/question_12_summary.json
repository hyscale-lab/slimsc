      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically dealing with the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The question is asking about the kinetic energy of the product particles. Let's see, the setup is that the Pi(+) is stationary and it decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. \n\nThe given masses are the rest masses. Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very tiny masses, but I think in these kinds of problems, the neutrino's mass is often neglected. Or maybe it's considered zero? Because in some cases, the mass is so small that it's treated as negligible compared to the other particles. So in that case, the neutrino's energy would just be its kinetic energy, and maybe its rest mass is zero.\n\nSo the problem is about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. \n\nLet me think about the energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of each particle is the sum of their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. \n\nSo, the muon's energy E_mu is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy K_mu. The neutrino's energy E_nu is just its kinetic energy K_nu because its rest mass is negligible. So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.\n\nSetting that equal to the initial energy: 139.6 = 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu. So K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.\n\nNow, about momentum. The pion is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as p as well (since their directions are opposite). \n\nThe energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, actually, the units are in MeV, so perhaps I should think in terms of energy in MeV. Maybe it's easier to work with the relativistic energy-momentum relation in natural units where c=1. So E^2 = p^2 + m^2. \n\nSo for the muon, E_mu^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2. For the neutrino, E_nu^2 = p^2 + 0 (since m_nu is zero). So E_nu = p.\n\nSo the two equations I have are:\n1. E_mu + E_nu = 139.6\n2. E_mu^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2\n3. E_nu = p\n\nWait, but E_nu = p? Because in natural units, E_nu = sqrt(p^2 c^4 + m^2 c^4), but if m is zero, E = p c. But since we're working in MeV and considering c=1, E_nu = p. So yeah, E_nu = p.\n\nSo substituting equation 3 into equation 1: E_mu + p = 139.6.\n\nFrom equation 2, E_mu^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nLet me express E_mu from equation 1: E_mu = 139.6 - p.\n\nSubstituting into equation 2: (139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nExpanding the left side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nSimplify. The p^2 terms cancel out on both sides. So:\n\n(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p = (105.7)^2.\n\nCalculate the squares: 139.6 squared is, let's see, 139.6 * 139.6. Hmm, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less. So 139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, 105.7 squared. 105^2 is 11025. 0.7^2 is 0.49. The cross term 2*105*0.7 = 147. So 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo plugging back into the equation:\n\n19488.16 - 2*139.6 p = 11172.49\n\nSubtract 11172.49 from both sides:\n\n19488.16 - 11172.49 = 2*139.6 p\n\nCalculate 19488.16 minus 11172.49.\n\n19488.16 - 11172.49: Let's do this step by step.\n\n19488.16\n-11172.49\n= ?\n\nSubtracting:\n\n19488.16\n-11172.49\n= (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 - 0.49)\nBut wait, 0.16 is less than 0.49, so we'll have to borrow.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as 19488.16 - 11172.49 = ?\n\nLet me compute 19488.16 - 11172 = 8316.16, then subtract 0.49 more: 8315.67 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo 8315.67 = 2 * 139.6 * p.\n\nSolve for p: p = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6)\n\nCalculate denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.\n\nSo p = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 Let's compute that.\n\nApproximating 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 = 8376, minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8. Hmm, that's too low. Because 279.2 *29 = 8096.8. But we have 8315.67, which is higher. So 29.5?\n\n279.2 *29.5 = 279.2*(29 +0.5)= 279.2*29 + 279.2 *0.5.\n\n279.2 *29: 279.2 *30 = 8376; minus 279.2 \u2192 8376 -279.2= 8096.8.\n\n279.2 *0.5=139.6.\n\nSo total is 8096.8 +139.6= 8236.4.\n\nBut 8236.4 is less than 8315.67. Difference is 8315.67-8236.4=79.27.\n\nSo how much more? Each 1 unit of p adds 279.2 to the product.\n\n79.27 /279.2 \u2248 0.284.\n\nSo total p \u224829.5 +0.284=29.784 \u2248 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but since we are using natural units where c=1, the units are MeV/c. But in our equations, we're just using MeV because E and p are in same units when c=1.\n\nSo p is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nBut wait, earlier calculation gives p = 8315.67 /279.2 \u2248 let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 8315.67 divided by 279.2.\n\nLet me do this division: 8315.67 /279.2 \u2248 Let's see.\n\n279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.\n\nSubtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67-8096.8=218.87.\n\nNow, 218.87 divided by 279.2 is approximately 0.784.\n\nSo p \u2248 29.784 MeV/c.\n\nWait, that's about 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nNow, E_nu = p \u224829.78 MeV.\n\nSo the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV, and since its rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is the same as its energy, 29.78 MeV.\n\nThen, the muon's energy E_mu =139.6 - p = 139.6 -29.78 \u2248109.82 MeV.\n\nThe muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu = 109.82 -105.7=4.12 MeV.\n\nSo the KE of the muon is 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close.\n\nOption C is 3.52 and 20.8, which doesn't match.\n\nOption B:7.2 and 32.8 \u2192 no.\n\nOption A: 2.84 and 26.8 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the correct option is D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me read the question again.\n\nThe problem states: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products, and the options are A to D.\n\nWait, right, in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta. That means their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but directions opposite.\n\nLet me think about the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion because it's stationary. So initial energy E_initial = m_pi c\u00b2, which is 139.6 MeV.\n\nAfter decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino is massless (I think, but I should confirm that. Wait, neutrinos are considered massless in many problems, so I'll go with that assumption here.)\n\nSo E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.\n\nBut wait, the muon will have kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, and the neutrino only has kinetic energy since it's massless. So,\n\nm_pi c\u00b2 = (m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu) + (K_nu).\n\nBut since the pion is at rest, the total momentum must be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nLet me denote the magnitude of the momentum of the muon as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p, but opposite direction. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.\n\nNow, energy for each particle: For the muon, E_mu\u00b2 = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2. For the neutrino, E_nu = p c, since its mass is zero.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nm_pi c\u00b2 = (m_mu c\u00b2 + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )) + (p c).\n\nWait, but I think I should set up equations to solve for p and the kinetic energies.\n\nLet me denote m_pi as M, m_mu as m. So,\n\nM c\u00b2 = m c\u00b2 + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ) + p c.\n\nHmm, but this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can square both sides or find a substitution.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that when a particle at rest decays into two particles, there's a formula for the kinetic energy of each. Wait, but in this case, one of the particles is massless (the neutrino), so maybe I can find a way to express the kinetic energies in terms of the masses.\n\nWait, let me think about the decay process. The pion is at rest, so the total energy is M. The muon and neutrino share this energy. Also, their momenta are equal and opposite.\n\nAnother approach: the total energy is the sum of the energies of mu and nu. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is p c, and the muon's energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c^4).\n\nSo,\n\nM c\u00b2 = m c\u00b2 + sqrt(p\u00b2 c^2 + m\u00b2 c^4) + p c.\n\nLet me subtract m c\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(M - m) c\u00b2 = sqrt(p\u00b2 c^2 + m\u00b2 c^4) + p c.\n\nLet me denote x = p c. Then,\n\n(M - m) c\u00b2 = sqrt(x\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c^4) + x.\n\nSo,\n\n(M - m) c\u00b2 - x = sqrt(x\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c^4).\n\nNow square both sides:\n\n[ (M - m) c\u00b2 - x ]\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c^4.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n= (M - m)^2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c\u00b2 x + x\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c^4.\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(M - m)^2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c\u00b2 x = m\u00b2 c^4.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n(M - m)^2 c^4 - m\u00b2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c\u00b2 x = 0.\n\nFactor out c^4:\n\n[ (M - m)^2 - m^2 ] c^4 - 2 (M - m) c\u00b2 x = 0.\n\nWait, let's compute (M - m)^2 - m\u00b2:\n\n= M\u00b2 - 2 M m + m\u00b2 - m\u00b2 = M\u00b2 - 2 M m.\n\nSo,\n\n(M\u00b2 - 2 M m) c^4 - 2 (M - m) c\u00b2 x = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by c^4:\n\n(M\u00b2 - 2 M m) - 2 (M - m) (x / c\u00b2 ) = 0.\n\nWait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Let me try to collect terms differently.\n\nWait, from the equation:\n\n(M - m)^2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c\u00b2 x = m\u00b2 c^4.\n\nLet me move m\u00b2 c^4 to the left:\n\n(M - m)^2 c^4 - m\u00b2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c\u00b2 x = 0.\n\nFactor:\n\n[ (M - m)^2 - m^2 ] c^4 - 2 (M - m) c^2 x = 0.\n\nWhich is same as:\n\n(M\u00b2 - 2 M m + m\u00b2 - m\u00b2) c^4 - 2 (M - m) c^2 x = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n(M\u00b2 - 2 M m) c^4 = 2 (M - m) c^2 x.\n\nDivide both sides by 2 (M - m) c^2:\n\n[ (M\u00b2 - 2 M m) c^4 ] / [ 2 (M - m) c^2 ] = x.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: M (M - 2 m) c^4.\n\nDenominator: 2 (M - m) c^2.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ M (M - 2 m) c^4 ] / [ 2 (M - m) c^2 ].\n\nSimplify c terms: c^4 / c^2 = c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ M (M - 2 m) c\u00b2 ] / [ 2 (M - m) ].\n\nWait, but x is p c. So,\n\np c = [ M (M - 2 m) c\u00b2 ] / [ 2 (M - m) ].\n\nSo,\n\np = [ M (M - 2 m) c ] / [ 2 (M - m) ].\n\nHmm, but maybe I can compute this numerically. Let me plug in the given values.\n\nM = 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2, m = 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nM - m = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nM - 2 m = 139.6 - 211.4 = -71.8 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\np c = [ 139.6 * (-71.8) ] / [ 2 * 33.9 ].\n\nWait, let's compute numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 139.6 * (-71.8) = let me compute 139.6 *70=9772, 139.6 *1.8=251.28. So 9772 + 251.28=9993.28, but with a negative sign: -9993.28 MeV\u00b2/c\u00b2.\n\nDenominator: 2 *33.9 = 67.8.\n\nSo,\n\np c = (-9993.28) / 67.8 \u2248 -147.3 MeV.\n\nWait, but momentum can't be negative. Oh wait, because in the equation, I have p c as x, and in the equation (M - m) c\u00b2 - x = sqrt(...), which has to be positive. So perhaps the negative here indicates that my assumption about the direction might be off, but the magnitude is positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should take absolute value. Because p is a magnitude, so it's positive. So x is p c, which is positive. So maybe I made a miscalculation in the signs.\n\nWait, let me recalculate M (M - 2 m):\n\nM=139.6, m=105.7. So 2m=211.4.\n\nM - 2m = 139.6 -211.4= -71.8.\n\nSo, M*(M-2m) = 139.6 * (-71.8) = - (139.6 *71.8) \u2248 - (139.6 *70=9772 + 139.6 *1.8=251.28)= - (9772 + 251.28) = -9993.28.\n\nSo, x = (M (M-2m) ) / [2 (M - m) ) ] * c\u00b2.\n\nWait, wait, I think I might have messed up units. Let me re-express the formula correctly.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nx = [ M (M - 2 m) c\u00b2 ] / [ 2 (M - m) ].\n\nWait, but M is in MeV/c\u00b2, and m is the same. So M (M - 2 m) is (MeV/c\u00b2) * (MeV/c\u00b2) = MeV\u00b2/c^4. Multiply by c\u00b2, so it's MeV\u00b2/c^2.\n\nDenominator: 2 (M - m) is in MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ M (M - 2 m) c\u00b2 ] / [ 2 (M - m) ].\n\nWhich is (MeV\u00b2/c^4 * c\u00b2 ) / (MeV/c\u00b2 ) = (MeV\u00b2 c\u00b2 ) / ( c^4 ) ) * (c^2 / MeV ) ) \u2192 Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute x as:\n\nx = [ M (M - 2 m) ] / [ 2 (M - m) ] * c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but since M and m are given in MeV/c\u00b2, the units would be (MeV\u00b2/c^4) * c\u00b2 / (MeV/c\u00b2) ) = (MeV\u00b2 c^2) / (c^4 MeV) ) \u2192 (MeV) / c\u00b2 * c\u00b2 \u2192 MeV.\n\nSo x is in MeV.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [139.6 * (139.6 - 2*105.7) ] / [ 2*(139.6 - 105.7) ].\n\nCompute numerator: 139.6 * (139.6 - 211.4) = 139.6 * (-71.8) = -9993.28.\n\nDenominator: 2 * 33.9 = 67.8.\n\nSo x = (-9993.28) / 67.8 \u2248 -147.3 MeV.\n\nWait, but x is p c, which should be positive because it's a magnitude. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the negative indicates that I have the wrong sign, and the correct value is positive. Maybe I should take the absolute value.\n\nSo x \u2248 147.3 MeV.\n\nWait, but that's p c. So p = x / c \u2248 147.3 MeV / c.\n\nWait, but let's think about the neutrino's energy. The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c = x = 147.3 MeV.\n\nAnd the muon's energy is E_mu = m c\u00b2 + K_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 c^2 + m\u00b2 c^4 ) = sqrt( (147.3)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) MeV.\n\nWait, because m is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2, so m c\u00b2 is 105.7 MeV.\n\nWait, so let me compute that.\n\nE_mu = sqrt( (147.3)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) MeV.\n\nCompute 147.3 squared: approx 147^2 = 21609, 0.3^2=0.09, so 21609 + 2*147*0.3 + 0.09 \u2248 21609 + 88.2 + 0.09 \u2248 21697.29.\n\n105.7^2 = approx 11172.49.\n\nSo sum is 21697.29 + 11172.49 \u2248 32869.78.\n\nsqrt(32869.78) \u2248 181.3 MeV.\n\nSo E_mu = 181.3 MeV.\n\nNow, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = 181.3 + 147.3 \u2248 328.6 MeV.\n\nWait, but the initial energy is M c\u00b2 = 139.6 MeV. That's way less than 328.6. That can't be right. So I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because 139.6 is the initial energy, and the sum is 328.6, which is way higher. So something's wrong with my calculations.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me go back.\n\nWait, earlier when I set up the equation:\n\nM c\u00b2 = m c\u00b2 + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) + p c.\n\nBut when I subtract m c\u00b2 from both sides, I get:\n\n(M - m) c\u00b2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) + p c.\n\nWait, but when I rearrange, I have:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) = (M - m) c\u00b2 - p c.\n\nBut sqrt is positive, so (M - m) c\u00b2 - p c must be positive. So,\n\np c < (M - m) c\u00b2.\n\nWhich for M=139.6 and m=105.7, M - m is 33.9 MeV. So p c must be less than 33.9 MeV.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated x (p c) as about 147 MeV, which is way larger than 33.9. So that can't be right. Therefore, my earlier approach must be flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra when I squared both sides. Let me try that again.\n\nSo starting from:\n\n(M - m) c\u00b2 - x = sqrt( x^2 + m^2 c^4 )\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me re-express.\n\nWait, the equation after substituting x = p c is:\n\n(M - m) c\u00b2 = sqrt( x^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) + x.\n\nWait, perhaps I should rearrange to isolate sqrt:\n\nsqrt( x^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) = (M - m) c\u00b2 - x.\n\nThen square both sides:\n\nx^2 + (m c^2)^2 = [ (M - m) c^2 - x ]^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n= (M - m)^2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c^2 x + x^2.\n\nSo,\n\nx^2 + m^2 c^4 = (M - m)^2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c^2 x + x^2.\n\nSubtract x^2 from both sides:\n\nm^2 c^4 = (M - m)^2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c^2 x.\n\nRearrange terms:\n\n2 (M - m) c^2 x = (M - m)^2 c^4 - m^2 c^4.\n\nFactor out c^4 on the right:\n\n= [ (M - m)^2 - m^2 ] c^4.\n\nWhich is:\n\n= [ M^2 - 2 M m + m^2 - m^2 ] c^4.\n\n= (M^2 - 2 M m) c^4.\n\nSo,\n\n2 (M - m) c^2 x = (M^2 - 2 M m) c^4.\n\nDivide both sides by 2 (M - m) c^2:\n\nx = [ (M^2 - 2 M m) c^4 ] / [ 2 (M - m) c^2 ].\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = [ M (M - 2 m) c\u00b2 ] / [ 2 (M - m) ].\n\nWait, that's the same expression as before. So plugging in the numbers again.\n\nM = 139.6, m=105.7.\n\nM - 2 m = 139.6 - 211.4 = -71.8.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [139.6 * (-71.8) c\u00b2 ] / [ 2 * 33.9 ].\n\nWait, but this gives a negative x, which can't be correct because x is p c, a positive quantity. So perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra, or perhaps the assumption that the neutrino is massless is incorrect. Wait, but neutrinos are very light, but not exactly massless. However, in this problem, it's given as part of the decay products, so perhaps we should treat the neutrino as massless.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the fact that when the pion is at rest, the decay products (muon and neutrino) must have equal and opposite momenta. But their energies must sum to the pion's rest energy.\n\nWait, another approach: The total energy is conserved. So,\n\nE_pi = E_mu + E_nu.\n\nAnd the total momentum is zero, so p_mu = -p_nu.\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, E_nu = |p_nu| c.\n\nAnd for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nE_pi = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + (p c).\n\nBecause p_mu = p (since p_nu = p in magnitude but opposite in direction, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, p is the same).\n\nSo,\n\nM c^2 = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 ) + p c.\n\nLet me let y = p c. Then,\n\nM c^2 = sqrt( y^2 + m^2 c^4 ) + y.\n\nRearranging,\n\nsqrt(y^2 + m^2 c^4) = M c^2 - y.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\ny^2 + m^2 c^4 = (M c^2)^2 - 2 M c^2 y + y^2.\n\nSubtract y^2 from both sides:\n\nm^2 c^4 = (M c^2)^2 - 2 M c^2 y.\n\nRearranged,\n\n2 M c^2 y = (M c^2)^2 - m^2 c^4.\n\nSo,\n\ny = [ (M^2 c^4 - m^2 c^4 ) ] / ( 2 M c^2 )\n\n= [ (M^2 - m^2 ) c^4 ] / ( 2 M c^2 )\n\n= [ (M^2 - m^2 ) c^2 ] / ( 2 M )\n\n= [ (M - m)(M + m) c^2 ] / ( 2 M )\n\nSo,\n\ny = p c = [ (M - m)(M + m) c^2 ] / ( 2 M )\n\nWait, that's a different result from before. So perhaps earlier I messed up the algebra.\n\nLet me compute this expression with M=139.6, m=105.7.\n\nM + m = 139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3.\n\nM - m = 33.9.\n\nSo,\n\ny = [ 33.9 * 245.3 * c^2 ] / ( 2 * 139.6 )\n\nCompute numerator: 33.9 * 245.3 \u2248 let's compute 34 * 245.3 = 34*200=6800, 34*45.3=1540.2 \u2192 total 8340.2.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me read the question again.\n\nThe problem states: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products, and the options are A to D.\n\nWait, right, in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta. That means their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but directions opposite.\n\nLet me think about the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion because it's stationary. So initial energy E_initial = m_pi c\u00b2, which is 139.6 MeV.\n\nAfter decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino is massless (I think, but I should confirm that. Wait, neutrinos are considered massless in many problems, so I'll go with that assumption here.)\n\nSo E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.\n\nBut wait, the muon will have kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, and the neutrino only has kinetic energy since it's massless. So,\n\nm_pi c\u00b2 = (m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu) + (K_nu).\n\nBut since the pion is at rest, the total momentum must be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nLet me denote the magnitude of the momentum of the muon as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p, but opposite direction. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.\n\nNow, energy for each particle: For the muon, E_mu\u00b2 = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2. For the neutrino, E_nu = p c, since its mass is zero.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nm_pi c\u00b2 = (m_mu c\u00b2 + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )) + (p c).\n\nWait, but I think I should set up equations to solve for p and the kinetic energies.\n\nLet me denote m_pi as M, m_mu as m. So,\n\nM c\u00b2 = m c\u00b2 + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ) + p c.\n\nHmm, but this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can square both sides or find a substitution.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that when a particle at rest decays into two particles, there's a formula for the kinetic energy of each. Wait, but in this case, one of the particles is massless (the neutrino), so maybe I can find a way to express the kinetic energies in terms of the masses.\n\nWait, let me think about the decay process. The pion is at rest, so the total energy is M. The muon and neutrino share this energy. Also, their momenta are equal and opposite.\n\nAnother approach: the total energy is the sum of the energies of mu and nu. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is p c, and the muon's energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c^4).\n\nSo,\n\nM c\u00b2 = m c\u00b2 + sqrt(p\u00b2 c^2 + m\u00b2 c^4) + p c.\n\nLet me subtract m c\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(M - m) c\u00b2 = sqrt(p\u00b2 c^2 + m\u00b2 c^4) + p c.\n\nLet me denote x = p c. Then,\n\n(M - m) c\u00b2 = sqrt(x\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c^4) + x.\n\nSo,\n\n(M - m) c\u00b2 - x = sqrt(x\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c^4).\n\nNow square both sides:\n\n[ (M - m) c\u00b2 - x ]\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c^4.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n= (M - m)^2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c\u00b2 x + x\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c^4.\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(M - m)^2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c\u00b2 x = m\u00b2 c^4.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n(M - m)^2 c^4 - m\u00b2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c\u00b2 x = 0.\n\nFactor out c^4:\n\n[ (M - m)^2 - m^2 ] c^4 - 2 (M - m) c\u00b2 x = 0.\n\nWait, let's compute (M - m)^2 - m\u00b2:\n\n= M\u00b2 - 2 M m + m\u00b2 - m\u00b2 = M\u00b2 - 2 M m.\n\nSo,\n\n(M\u00b2 - 2 M m) c^4 - 2 (M - m) c\u00b2 x = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by c^4:\n\n(M\u00b2 - 2 M m) - 2 (M - m) (x / c\u00b2 ) = 0.\n\nWait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Let me try to collect terms differently.\n\nWait, from the equation:\n\n(M - m)^2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c\u00b2 x = m\u00b2 c^4.\n\nLet me move m\u00b2 c^4 to the left:\n\n(M - m)^2 c^4 - m\u00b2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c\u00b2 x = 0.\n\nFactor:\n\n[ (M - m)^2 - m^2 ] c^4 - 2 (M - m) c^2 x = 0.\n\nWhich is same as:\n\n(M\u00b2 - 2 M m + m\u00b2 - m\u00b2) c^4 - 2 (M - m) c^2 x = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n(M\u00b2 - 2 M m) c^4 = 2 (M - m) c^2 x.\n\nDivide both sides by 2 (M - m) c^2:\n\n[ (M\u00b2 - 2 M m) c^4 ] / [ 2 (M - m) c^2 ] = x.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: M (M - 2 m) c^4.\n\nDenominator: 2 (M - m) c^2.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ M (M - 2 m) c^4 ] / [ 2 (M - m) c^2 ].\n\nSimplify c terms: c^4 / c^2 = c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ M (M - 2 m) c\u00b2 ] / [ 2 (M - m) ].\n\nWait, but x is p c. So,\n\np c = [ M (M - 2 m) c\u00b2 ] / [ 2 (M - m) ].\n\nSo,\n\np = [ M (M - 2 m) c ] / [ 2 (M - m) ].\n\nHmm, but maybe I can compute this numerically. Let me plug in the given values.\n\nM = 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2, m = 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nM - m = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nM - 2 m = 139.6 - 211.4 = -71.8 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\np c = [ 139.6 * (-71.8) ] / [ 2 * 33.9 ].\n\nWait, let's compute numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 139.6 * (-71.8) = let me compute 139.6 *70=9772, 139.6 *1.8=251.28. So 9772 + 251.28=9993.28, but with a negative sign: -9993.28 MeV\u00b2/c\u00b2.\n\nDenominator: 2 *33.9 = 67.8.\n\nSo,\n\np c = (-9993.28) / 67.8 \u2248 -147.3 MeV.\n\nWait, but momentum can't be negative. Oh wait, because in the equation, I have p c as x, and in the equation (M - m) c\u00b2 - x = sqrt(...), which has to be positive. So perhaps the negative here indicates that my assumption about the direction might be off, but the magnitude is positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should take absolute value. Because p is a magnitude, so it's positive. So x is p c, which is positive. So maybe I made a miscalculation in the signs.\n\nWait, let me recalculate M (M - 2 m):\n\nM=139.6, m=105.7. So 2m=211.4.\n\nM - 2m = 139.6 -211.4= -71.8.\n\nSo, M*(M-2m) = 139.6 * (-71.8) = - (139.6 *71.8) \u2248 - (139.6 *70=9772 + 139.6 *1.8=251.28)= - (9772 + 251.28) = -9993.28.\n\nSo, x = (M (M-2m) ) / [2 (M - m) ) ] * c\u00b2.\n\nWait, wait, I think I might have messed up units. Let me re-express the formula correctly.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nx = [ M (M - 2 m) c\u00b2 ] / [ 2 (M - m) ].\n\nWait, but M is in MeV/c\u00b2, and m is the same. So M (M - 2 m) is (MeV/c\u00b2) * (MeV/c\u00b2) = MeV\u00b2/c^4. Multiply by c\u00b2, so it's MeV\u00b2/c^2.\n\nDenominator: 2 (M - m) is in MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ M (M - 2 m) c\u00b2 ] / [ 2 (M - m) ].\n\nWhich is (MeV\u00b2/c^4 * c\u00b2 ) / (MeV/c\u00b2 ) = (MeV\u00b2 c\u00b2 ) / ( c^4 ) ) * (c^2 / MeV ) ) \u2192 Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute x as:\n\nx = [ M (M - 2 m) ] / [ 2 (M - m) ] * c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but since M and m are given in MeV/c\u00b2, the units would be (MeV\u00b2/c^4) * c\u00b2 / (MeV/c\u00b2) ) = (MeV\u00b2 c^2) / (c^4 MeV) ) \u2192 (MeV) / c\u00b2 * c\u00b2 \u2192 MeV.\n\nSo x is in MeV.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [139.6 * (139.6 - 2*105.7) ] / [ 2*(139.6 - 105.7) ].\n\nCompute numerator: 139.6 * (139.6 - 211.4) = 139.6 * (-71.8) = -9993.28.\n\nDenominator: 2 * 33.9 = 67.8.\n\nSo x = (-9993.28) / 67.8 \u2248 -147.3 MeV.\n\nWait, but x is p c, which should be positive because it's a magnitude. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the negative indicates that I have the wrong sign, and the correct value is positive. Maybe I should take the absolute value.\n\nSo x \u2248 147.3 MeV.\n\nWait, but that's p c. So p = x / c \u2248 147.3 MeV / c.\n\nWait, but let's think about the neutrino's energy. The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c = x = 147.3 MeV.\n\nAnd the muon's energy is E_mu = m c\u00b2 + K_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 c^2 + m\u00b2 c^4 ) = sqrt( (147.3)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) MeV.\n\nWait, because m is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2, so m c\u00b2 is 105.7 MeV.\n\nWait, so let me compute that.\n\nE_mu = sqrt( (147.3)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) MeV.\n\nCompute 147.3 squared: approx 147^2 = 21609, 0.3^2=0.09, so 21609 + 2*147*0.3 + 0.09 \u2248 21609 + 88.2 + 0.09 \u2248 21697.29.\n\n105.7^2 = approx 11172.49.\n\nSo sum is 21697.29 + 11172.49 \u2248 32869.78.\n\nsqrt(32869.78) \u2248 181.3 MeV.\n\nSo E_mu = 181.3 MeV.\n\nNow, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = 181.3 + 147.3 \u2248 328.6 MeV.\n\nWait, but the initial energy is M c\u00b2 = 139.6 MeV. That's way less than 328.6. That can't be right. So I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because 139.6 is the initial energy, and the sum is 328.6, which is way higher. So something's wrong with my calculations.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me go back.\n\nWait, earlier when I set up the equation:\n\nM c\u00b2 = m c\u00b2 + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) + p c.\n\nBut when I subtract m c\u00b2 from both sides, I get:\n\n(M - m) c\u00b2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) + p c.\n\nWait, but when I rearrange, I have:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) = (M - m) c\u00b2 - p c.\n\nBut sqrt is positive, so (M - m) c\u00b2 - p c must be positive. So,\n\np c < (M - m) c\u00b2.\n\nWhich for M=139.6 and m=105.7, M - m is 33.9 MeV. So p c must be less than 33.9 MeV.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated x (p c) as about 147 MeV, which is way larger than 33.9. So that can't be right. Therefore, my earlier approach must be flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra when I squared both sides. Let me try that again.\n\nSo starting from:\n\n(M - m) c\u00b2 - x = sqrt( x^2 + m^2 c^4 )\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me re-express.\n\nWait, the equation after substituting x = p c is:\n\n(M - m) c\u00b2 = sqrt( x^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) + x.\n\nWait, perhaps I should rearrange to isolate sqrt:\n\nsqrt( x^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) = (M - m) c\u00b2 - x.\n\nThen square both sides:\n\nx^2 + (m c^2)^2 = [ (M - m) c^2 - x ]^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n= (M - m)^2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c^2 x + x^2.\n\nSo,\n\nx^2 + m^2 c^4 = (M - m)^2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c^2 x + x^2.\n\nSubtract x^2 from both sides:\n\nm^2 c^4 = (M - m)^2 c^4 - 2 (M - m) c^2 x.\n\nRearrange terms:\n\n2 (M - m) c^2 x = (M - m)^2 c^4 - m^2 c^4.\n\nFactor out c^4 on the right:\n\n= [ (M - m)^2 - m^2 ] c^4.\n\nWhich is:\n\n= [ M^2 - 2 M m + m^2 - m^2 ] c^4.\n\n= (M^2 - 2 M m) c^4.\n\nSo,\n\n2 (M - m) c^2 x = (M^2 - 2 M m) c^4.\n\nDivide both sides by 2 (M - m) c^2:\n\nx = [ (M^2 - 2 M m) c^4 ] / [ 2 (M - m) c^2 ].\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = [ M (M - 2 m) c\u00b2 ] / [ 2 (M - m) ].\n\nWait, that's the same expression as before. So plugging in the numbers again.\n\nM = 139.6, m=105.7.\n\nM - 2 m = 139.6 - 211.4 = -71.8.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [139.6 * (-71.8) c\u00b2 ] / [ 2 * 33.9 ].\n\nWait, but this gives a negative x, which can't be correct because x is p c, a positive quantity. So perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra, or perhaps the assumption that the neutrino is massless is incorrect. Wait, but neutrinos are very light, but not exactly massless. However, in this problem, it's given as part of the decay products, so perhaps we should treat the neutrino as massless.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the fact that when the pion is at rest, the decay products (muon and neutrino) must have equal and opposite momenta. But their energies must sum to the pion's rest energy.\n\nWait, another approach: The total energy is conserved. So,\n\nE_pi = E_mu + E_nu.\n\nAnd the total momentum is zero, so p_mu = -p_nu.\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, E_nu = |p_nu| c.\n\nAnd for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nE_pi = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + (p c).\n\nBecause p_mu = p (since p_nu = p in magnitude but opposite in direction, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, p is the same).\n\nSo,\n\nM c^2 = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 ) + p c.\n\nLet me let y = p c. Then,\n\nM c^2 = sqrt( y^2 + m^2 c^4 ) + y.\n\nRearranging,\n\nsqrt(y^2 + m^2 c^4) = M c^2 - y.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\ny^2 + m^2 c^4 = (M c^2)^2 - 2 M c^2 y + y^2.\n\nSubtract y^2 from both sides:\n\nm^2 c^4 = (M c^2)^2 - 2 M c^2 y.\n\nRearranged,\n\n2 M c^2 y = (M c^2)^2 - m^2 c^4.\n\nSo,\n\ny = [ (M^2 c^4 - m^2 c^4 ) ] / ( 2 M c^2 )\n\n= [ (M^2 - m^2 ) c^4 ] / ( 2 M c^2 )\n\n= [ (M^2 - m^2 ) c^2 ] / ( 2 M )\n\n= [ (M - m)(M + m) c^2 ] / ( 2 M )\n\nSo,\n\ny = p c = [ (M - m)(M + m) c^2 ] / ( 2 M )\n\nWait, that's a different result from before. So perhaps earlier I messed up the algebra.\n\nLet me compute this expression with M=139.6, m=105.7.\n\nM + m = 139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3.\n\nM - m = 33.9.\n\nSo,\n\ny = [ 33.9 * 245.3 * c^2 ] / ( 2 * 139.6 )\n\nCompute numerator: 33.9 * 245.3 \u2248 let's compute 34 * 245.3 = 34*200=6800, 34*45.3=1540.2 \u2192 total 8340.2.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay Pi(+) \u2192 mu(+) + nu. Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two KE values.\n\nHmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the products must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Also, the total energy should add up correctly.\n\nSo, the decay is Pi+ \u2192 mu+ + nu. Wait, the neutrino is involved here. But neutrinos are neutral and have very little mass, so maybe we can approximate their mass as zero? Or do I need to consider it?\n\nWait, in problems like this, if the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the other particles, we can treat it as massless. That would make the calculations easier. So, I'll assume the neutrino's mass is zero.\n\nThe rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so I can ignore it for now.\n\nSince the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to sum to zero. So, their magnitudes are the same, but directions opposite.\n\nLet me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV.\n\nAfter decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy is its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is zero).\n\nSo, the equation for energy conservation would be:\n\nE_pion = E_muon + E_neutrino\n139.6 MeV = (m_mu * c^2 + K_mu) + K_nu\n\nBut wait, the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because E = pc for massless particles. Similarly, the muon's energy is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) = m_mu c^2 + K_mu.\n\nWait, but since the pion is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.\n\nSo, for the muon, E_muon = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )\n\nAnd for the neutrino, E_nu = p c\n\nSo the total energy is E_muon + E_nu = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) + p c = 139.6 MeV.\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can square both sides or find another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the total energy is conserved and the total momentum is zero.\n\nLet me denote the kinetic energies as K_mu and K_nu. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is entirely kinetic, so E_nu = K_nu = p c.\n\nThe muon's energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy: E_muon = m_mu c^2 + K_mu.\n\nSo,\n\nm_pi c^2 = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + (p c )\n\nBut the momentum p of the muon is the same as the neutrino's, because their momenta are equal and opposite.\n\nWait, but the total momentum is zero, so p_mu = p_nu.\n\nSo, p_mu = p_nu = p.\n\nSo, the momentum p can be related to the muon's energy. For the muon:\n\nE_muon^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2\n\nSo,\n\n(p c)^2 = E_muon^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2\n\nBut E_muon = m_mu c^2 + K_mu.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to write the energy equation:\n\nm_pi c^2 = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + (p c )\n\nAnd from the muon's energy,\n\n(p c)^2 = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu)^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2\n\nExpanding that,\n\n(p c)^2 = (m_mu^2 c^4 + 2 m_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2) - m_mu^2 c^4\n\n= 2 m_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2\n\nSo,\n\np c = sqrt(2 m_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 )\n\nBut from the energy equation,\n\np c = m_pi c^2 - m_mu c^2 - K_mu\n\nHmm, so substitute p c into the equation:\n\nsqrt(2 m_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 ) = m_pi c^2 - m_mu c^2 - K_mu\n\nThis looks complicated, but perhaps I can square both sides.\n\nLet me denote K = K_mu for simplicity.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( 2 m_mu c^2 K + K^2 ) = (m_pi c^2 - m_mu c^2 - K )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n2 m_mu c^2 K + K^2 = (m_pi c^2 - m_mu c^2 - K )^2\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n= [ (m_pi - m_mu) c^2 - K ]^2\n\n= ( (m_pi - m_mu) c^2 )^2 - 2 (m_pi - m_mu) c^2 K + K^2\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nLeft: 2 m_mu c^2 K + K^2\n\nRight: (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 - 2 (m_pi - m_mu) c^2 K + K^2\n\nSubtract left from both sides:\n\n0 = (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 - 2 (m_pi - m_mu) c^2 K + K^2 - [2 m_mu c^2 K + K^2 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 = (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 - 2 (m_pi - m_mu) c^2 K - 2 m_mu c^2 K\n\nCombine the K terms:\n\n= (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 - [ 2 (m_pi - m_mu) + 2 m_mu ] c^2 K\n\nFactor 2 c^2 K:\n\n= (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 - 2 c^2 K (m_pi - m_mu + m_mu )\n\n= (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 - 2 c^2 K m_pi\n\nHmm, that's better.\n\nSo,\n\n2 c^2 K m_pi = (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4\n\nDivide both sides by 2 c^2 m_pi:\n\nK = [ (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 ] / ( 2 c^2 m_pi )\n\nSimplify:\n\nK = [ (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^2 ] / ( 2 m_pi )\n\nBut since m_pi and m_mu are given in MeV/c\u00b2, when we square them, we get (MeV)^2 / c^4. So, let's compute the numbers.\n\nWait, let's compute m_pi - m_mu:\n\nm_pi = 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2\n\nm_mu = 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2\n\nm_pi - m_mu = 33.9 MeV/c\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n(m_pi - m_mu)^2 = (33.9)^2 = 1149.21 (MeV/c\u00b2)^2\n\nThen,\n\nK = [1149.21 (MeV/c\u00b2)^2 * c^2 ] / ( 2 * 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, the c^2 in the numerator and denominator would cancel out except for the units. Let me compute numerically.\n\nWait, let me think about units. Let's set c=1 for simplicity, as these are energy in MeV.\n\nWait, in particle physics, when we use MeV, we often set c=1, so masses are in MeV/c\u00b2, but when multiplied by c\u00b2, they become MeV.\n\nSo, in this case,\n\nK = [ (33.9 MeV/c\u00b2 )^2 * c^2 ] / ( 2 * 139.6 MeV )\n\nWait, because m_pi is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2, so when multiplied by c^2, it's 139.6 MeV.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it in terms of units:\n\nK = ( (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 ) / ( 2 m_pi c^2 )\n\nWhich simplifies to ( (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^2 ) / ( 2 m_pi )\n\nBut since c^2 is in units of (MeV^2 / (MeV/c\u00b2)^2 ) )? Hmm, perhaps this is getting too confusing. Let me proceed numerically.\n\nCompute numerator: (33.9)^2 = 1149.21 (MeV/c\u00b2)^2\n\nMultiply by c^2: 1149.21 (MeV/c\u00b2)^2 * c^2 = 1149.21 MeV\u00b2\n\nDenominator: 2 * 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 * c^2 = 2 * 139.6 MeV\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me write K as:\n\nK = [ (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 ] / [ 2 m_pi c^2 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nK = [ (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^2 ] / [ 2 m_pi ]\n\nSo, (33.9)^2 = 1149.21, as above.\n\nSo,\n\nK = (1149.21 (MeV/c\u00b2)^2 * c^2 ) / ( 2 * 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, the c\u00b2 in the numerator and denominator will cancel:\n\n= (1149.21 (MeV)^2 ) / ( 2 * 139.6 MeV )\n\n= 1149.21 / (279.2) MeV\n\nCompute that:\n\n1149.21 \u00f7 279.2 \u2248 Let me calculate.\n\n279.2 * 4 = 1116.8 \u2192 4 * 279.2 = 1116.8 \u2192 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41.\n\n32.41 / 279.2 \u2248 0.116.\n\nSo, K \u2248 4.116 MeV.\n\nWait, that's approximately 4.12 MeV. So, the kinetic energy of the muon is about 4.12 MeV.\n\nNow, what about the neutrino's kinetic energy?\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\np c = m_pi c^2 - m_mu c^2 - K_mu\n\nBut with K_mu = 4.12 MeV.\n\nSo,\n\np c = 139.6 - 105.7 - 4.12 = ?\n\n139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9, 33.9 -4.12 = 29.78 MeV.\n\nWait, but p c is the energy of the neutrino, which is K_nu = 29.78 MeV.\n\nSo, the KE of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.78 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.\n\nThat's close.

That would make the calculations easier. So, I'll assume the neutrino's mass is zero.\n\nThe rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so I can ignore it for now.\n\nSince the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to sum to zero. So, their magnitudes are the same, but directions opposite.\n\nLet me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV.\n\nAfter decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy is its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is zero).\n\nSo, the equation for energy conservation would be:\n\nE_pion = E_muon + E_neutrino\n139.6 MeV = (m_mu * c^2 + K_mu) + K_nu\n\nBut wait, the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because E = pc for massless particles. Similarly, the muon's energy is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) = m_mu c^2 + K_mu.\n\nWait, but since the pion is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.\n\nSo, for the muon, E_muon = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )\n\nAnd for the neutrino, E_nu = p c\n\nSo the total energy is E_muon + E_nu = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) + p c = 139.6 MeV.\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can square both sides or find another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the total energy is conserved and the total momentum is zero.\n\nLet me denote the kinetic energies as K_mu and K_nu. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is entirely kinetic, so E_nu = K_nu = p c.\n\nThe muon's energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy: E_muon = m_mu c^2 + K_mu.\n\nSo,\n\nm_pi c^2 = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + (p c )\n\nBut the momentum p of the muon is the same as the neutrino's, because their momenta are equal and opposite.\n\nWait, but the total momentum is zero, so p_mu = p_nu.\n\nSo, p_mu = p_nu = p.\n\nSo, the momentum p can be related to the muon's energy. For the muon:\n\nE_muon^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2\n\nSo,\n\n(p c)^2 = E_muon^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2\n\nBut E_muon = m_mu c^2 + K_mu.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to write the energy equation:\n\nm_pi c^2 = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + (p c )\n\nAnd from the muon's energy,\n\n(p c)^2 = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu)^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2\n\nExpanding that,\n\n(p c)^2 = (m_mu^2 c^4 + 2 m_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2) - m_mu^2 c^4\n\n= 2 m_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2\n\nSo,\n\np c = sqrt(2 m_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 )\n\nBut from the energy equation,\n\np c = m_pi c^2 - m_mu c^2 - K_mu\n\nHmm, so substitute p c into the equation:\n\nsqrt(2 m_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 ) = m_pi c^2 - m_mu c^2 - K_mu\n\nThis looks complicated, but perhaps I can square both sides.\n\nLet me denote K = K_mu for simplicity.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( 2 m_mu c^2 K + K^2 ) = (m_pi c^2 - m_mu c^2 - K )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n2 m_mu c^2 K + K^2 = (m_pi c^2 - m_mu c^2 - K )^2\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n= [ (m_pi - m_mu) c^2 - K ]^2\n\n= ( (m_pi - m_mu) c^2 )^2 - 2 (m_pi - m_mu) c^2 K + K^2\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nLeft: 2 m_mu c^2 K + K^2\n\nRight: (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 - 2 (m_pi - m_mu) c^2 K + K^2\n\nSubtract left from both sides:\n\n0 = (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 - 2 (m_pi - m_mu) c^2 K + K^2 - [2 m_mu c^2 K + K^2 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 = (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 - 2 (m_pi - m_mu) c^2 K - 2 m_mu c^2 K\n\nCombine the K terms:\n\n= (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 - [ 2 (m_pi - m_mu) + 2 m_mu ] c^2 K\n\nFactor 2 c^2 K:\n\n= (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 - 2 c^2 K (m_pi - m_mu + m_mu )\n\n= (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 - 2 c^2 K m_pi\n\nHmm, that's better.\n\nSo,\n\n2 c^2 K m_pi = (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4\n\nDivide both sides by 2 c^2 m_pi:\n\nK = [ (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 ] / ( 2 c^2 m_pi )\n\nSimplify:\n\nK = [ (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^2 ] / ( 2 m_pi )\n\nBut since m_pi and m_mu are given in MeV/c\u00b2, when we square them, we get (MeV)^2 / c^4. So, let's compute the numbers.\n\nWait, let's compute m_pi - m_mu:\n\nm_pi = 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2\n\nm_mu = 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2\n\nm_pi - m_mu = 33.9 MeV/c\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n(m_pi - m_mu)^2 = (33.9)^2 = 1149.21 (MeV/c\u00b2)^2\n\nThen,\n\nK = [1149.21 (MeV/c\u00b2)^2 * c^2 ] / ( 2 * 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, the c^2 in the numerator and denominator would cancel out except for the units. Let me compute numerically.\n\nWait, let me think about units. Let's set c=1 for simplicity, as these are energy in MeV.\n\nWait, in particle physics, when we use MeV, we often set c=1, so masses are in MeV/c\u00b2, but when multiplied by c\u00b2, they become MeV.\n\nSo, in this case,\n\nK = [ (33.9 MeV/c\u00b2 )^2 * c^2 ] / ( 2 * 139.6 MeV )\n\nWait, because m_pi is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2, so when multiplied by c^2, it's 139.6 MeV.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it in terms of units:\n\nK = ( (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 ) / ( 2 m_pi c^2 )\n\nWhich simplifies to ( (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^2 ) / ( 2 m_pi )\n\nBut since c^2 is in units of (MeV^2 / (MeV/c\u00b2)^2 ) )? Hmm, perhaps this is getting too confusing. Let me proceed numerically.\n\nCompute numerator: (33.9)^2 = 1149.21 (MeV/c\u00b2)^2\n\nMultiply by c^2: 1149.21 (MeV/c\u00b2)^2 * c^2 = 1149.21 MeV\u00b2\n\nDenominator: 2 * 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 * c^2 = 2 * 139.6 MeV\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me write K as:\n\nK = [ (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^4 ] / [ 2 m_pi c^2 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nK = [ (m_pi - m_mu)^2 c^2 ] / [ 2 m_pi ]\n\nSo, (33.9)^2 = 1149.21, as above.\n\nSo,\n\nK = (1149.21 (MeV/c\u00b2)^2 * c^2 ) / ( 2 * 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, the c\u00b2 in the numerator and denominator will cancel:\n\n= (1149.21 (MeV)^2 ) / ( 2 * 139.6 MeV )\n\n= 1149.21 / (279.2) MeV\n\nCompute that:\n\n1149.21 \u00f7 279.2 \u2248 Let me calculate.\n\n279.2 * 4 = 1116.8 \u2192 4 * 279.2 = 1116.8 \u2192 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41.\n\n32.41 / 279.2 \u2248 0.116.\n\nSo, K \u2248 4.116 MeV.\n\nWait, that's approximately 4.12 MeV. So, the kinetic energy of the muon is about 4.12 MeV.\n\nNow, what about the neutrino's kinetic energy?\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\np c = m_pi c^2 - m_mu c^2 - K_mu\n\nBut with K_mu = 4.12 MeV.\n\nSo,\n\np c = 139.6 - 105.7 - 4.12 = ?\n\n139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9, 33.9 -4.12 = 29.78 MeV.\n\nWait, but p c is the energy of the neutrino, which is K_nu = 29.78 MeV.\n\nSo, the KE of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.78 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.\n\nThat's close. So, the answer should be D.\n\n\nTo determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay process:\n\n**Decay Process**:  \n\\[\n\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu\n\\]  \nThe pion (\\(\\pi^+\\)) is stationary, and its rest mass is \\(139.6 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion (Pi+) at rest decays into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The given masses are Pi+ is 139.6 MeV and mu+ is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two kinetic energies, probably for the muon and neutrino.\n\nWait, I remember that in particle decays, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. But wait, the neutrino has negligible mass, right? Or does it? Hmm, I think in some cases, like beta decay, the neutrino's mass is considered negligible compared to the other particles. So maybe we can treat it as massless here.\n\nSo, the decay equation is Pi+ \u2192 mu+ + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. So, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p, then the neutrino's momentum would be -p.\n\nWait, but in terms of magnitude, their momenta are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.\n\nBut the neutrino is massless, so its energy comes only from its momentum. The muon has both rest mass and kinetic energy contributing to its energy.\n\nThe total energy in the system is the rest mass energy of the pion, since it's at rest. So the initial energy is just m_pi c\u00b2 = 139.6 MeV.\n\nAfter decay, the energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy E_mu is its rest energy plus kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu. The neutrino's energy E_nu is just |p_nu| c, since its mass is negligible. Since p_nu = p, E_nu = p c.\n\nSo, the conservation of energy gives:\n\nm_pi c\u00b2 = E_mu + E_nu\n139.6 MeV = (m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu) + (p c)\n\nAnd conservation of momentum says that the momenta are equal and opposite. So, the magnitude of the muon's momentum is p, and the neutrino's is p. So, the muon's momentum is p, and the neutrino's is also p, but in opposite direction.\n\nNow, for the muon, using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E_mu\u00b2 = (p c)\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)\u00b2. Wait, no, the correct equation is E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2. Wait, no, units get confusing. Let me write it correctly. The energy squared is equal to the square of the momentum times c squared plus the square of the rest mass energy squared.\n\nSo,\n\nE_mu\u00b2 = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2.\n\nBut E_mu is m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu. So,\n\n(m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu)^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n(m_mu\u00b2 c^4 + 2 m_mu c\u00b2 K_mu + K_mu\u00b2) = (p^2 c^2) + m_mu\u00b2 c^4.\n\nSubtract m_mu\u00b2 c^4 from both sides:\n\n2 m_mu c\u00b2 K_mu + K_mu\u00b2 = p\u00b2 c^2.\n\nBut from energy conservation earlier:\n\n139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + p c.\n\nWait, wait, let me express everything in MeV units. So m_pi c\u00b2 is 139.6 MeV, m_mu c\u00b2 is 105.7 MeV. Let me write everything in MeV and let c=1 for simplicity. So,\n\n139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + p.\n\nBut wait, in units where c=1, E is in MeV, mass is in MeV/c\u00b2, so m_mu c\u00b2 is 105.7 MeV. So, I can treat all energies as MeV, and momenta as MeV/c, but perhaps I'll set c=1 to simplify.\n\nSo, in c=1 units, the energy equation becomes:\n\n139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + p.\n\nBut from the muon's energy-momentum equation:\n\n(105.7 + K_mu)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n105.7^2 + 2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2.\n\nSubtract 105.7^2 from both sides:\n\n2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu^2 = p^2.\n\nSo p^2 = (2 * 105.7 * K_mu) + K_mu^2.\n\nNow, substitute p from the energy equation. From energy:\n\np = 139.6 - (105.7 + K_mu) = 139.6 - 105.7 - K_mu = 33.9 - K_mu.\n\nSo p = 33.9 - K_mu.\n\nSo p^2 = (33.9 - K_mu)^2.\n\nSetting that equal to the expression from the energy-momentum:\n\n(33.9 - K_mu)^2 = 2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu^2.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n(33.9)^2 - 2 * 33.9 * K_mu + K_mu^2 = 211.4 * K_mu + K_mu^2.\n\nWait, because 2*105.7 is 211.4. So,\n\n33.9^2 - 67.8 K_mu + K_mu^2 = 211.4 K_mu + K_mu^2.\n\nSubtract K_mu^2 from both sides:\n\n33.9^2 -67.8 K_mu = 211.4 K_mu.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n33.9^2 = 211.4 K_mu + 67.8 K_mu.\n\nWhich is:\n\n33.9^2 = (211.4 +67.8) K_mu.\n\nAdding 211.4 and 67.8: 279.2.\n\nSo,\n\nK_mu = (33.9^2) / 279.2.\n\nCalculating 33.9 squared: 33.9 * 33.9.\n\nLet me compute that: 33^2 is 1089, 0.9^2 is 0.81, and cross terms 2*33*0.9 = 59.4. So,\n\n(33 + 0.9)^2 = 33^2 + 2*33*0.9 + 0.9^2 = 1089 + 59.4 + 0.81 = 1149.21.\n\nSo,\n\nK_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n279.2 times 4 is 1116.8, which is less than 1149.21. 4.1 is 279.2 *4.1= 1144.72. Hmm, 4.1 gives 1144.72. 4.12: 279.2 *0.02=5.584 \u2192 1144.72 +5.584= 1150.304, which is a bit higher than 1149.21.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 1149.21 / 279.2 exactly.\n\nLet me compute 279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. The difference is 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41.\n\n32.41 / 279.2 \u2248 0.116.\n\nSo, K_mu \u2248 4.116 MeV.\n\nWait, that's approximately 4.12 MeV. Hmm, looking at the options, option D gives 4.12 MeV for the first value. But wait, what's the second value? The second is for the neutrino.\n\nWait, the neutrino's energy is p c (with c=1, so p is in MeV/c, but since c=1, E = p). From earlier, p = 33.9 - K_mu. So K_mu is about 4.12, so p \u224833.9 -4.12=29.78 MeV.\n\nSo the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV. Wait, but the neutrino's kinetic energy is its total energy because its rest mass is negligible. So, the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.78 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that seems to match.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again to make sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe use conservation of energy and momentum more carefully.\n\nWait, since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the muon's momentum as p and the neutrino's as -p.\n\nSo, the muon's energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) = m_mu c^2 gamma, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe neutrino's energy is |p| c, since its mass is negligible.\n\nSo, the total energy is:\n\nm_pi c^2 = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c.\n\nLet me write m_pi c^2 as 139.6 MeV, m_mu c^2 as 105.7 MeV.\n\nSo,\n\n139.6 = sqrt( p\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2 ) + p.\n\nLet me denote x = p.\n\nSo,\n\n139.6 = sqrt(x\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) + x.\n\nLet me subtract x from both sides:\n\n139.6 - x = sqrt(x\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(139.6 - x)^2 = x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(139.6)^2 - 279.2 x = (105.7)^2.\n\nCompute 139.6^2: 139.6 * 139.6. Let me compute that.\n\n139^2 is 19321, 0.6^2 is 0.36, cross terms 2*139*0.6=166.8. So,\n\n(139 + 0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 +0.6^2 = 19321 + 166.8 +0.36= 19488.16.\n\nSimilarly, 105.7^2: 105^2 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, cross terms 2*105*0.7=147. So,\n\n(105 +0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 +0.49=11172.49.\n\nSo,\n\n19488.16 - 279.2 x = 11172.49.\n\nSubtract 11172.49 from both sides:\n\n19488.16 -11172.49 = 279.2 x.\n\nCompute 19488.16 -11172.49:\n\n19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nSo,\n\n8315.67 = 279.2 x \u2192 x = 8315.67 / 279.2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376 -279.2=8096.8. Hmm, but 8315.67 is less than that. Wait, perhaps 29.7.\n\nWait, 279.2 *29 = 279.2 *20=5584, 279.2 *9=2512.8 \u2192 5584+2512.8=8096.8.\n\nDifference between 8315.67 and 8096.8 is 218.87.\n\nSo 218.87 / 279.2 \u2248 0.783. So x \u2248 29.783.\n\nSo p \u224829.783 MeV/c.\n\nSo the neutrino's energy is p c =29.783 MeV.\n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt( p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ) = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) \u2248 sqrt(887.07 + 11172.49 ) = sqrt(12059.56) \u2248109.81 MeV.\n\nSo the muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 -105.7 \u22484.11 MeV. So that's about 4.12 MeV, which matches option D.\n\nSo the KE of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is \"4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.\" So that's the correct choice.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion (Pi+) at rest decays into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The given masses are Pi+ is 139.6 MeV and mu+ is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two kinetic energies, probably for the muon and neutrino.\n\nWait, I remember that in particle decays, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. But wait, the neutrino has negligible mass, right? Or does it? Hmm, I think in some cases, like beta decay, the neutrino's mass is considered negligible compared to the other particles. So maybe we can treat it as massless here.\n\nSo, the decay equation is Pi+ \u2192 mu+ + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. So, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p, then the neutrino's momentum would be -p.\n\nWait, but in terms of magnitude, their momenta are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.\n\nBut the neutrino is massless, so its energy comes only from its momentum. The muon has both rest mass and kinetic energy contributing to its energy.\n\nThe total energy in the system is the rest mass energy of the pion, since it's at rest. So the initial energy is just m_pi c\u00b2 = 139.6 MeV.\n\nAfter decay, the energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy E_mu is its rest energy plus kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu. The neutrino's energy E_nu is just |p_nu| c, since its mass is negligible. Since p_nu = p, E_nu = p c.\n\nSo, the conservation of energy gives:\n\nm_pi c\u00b2 = E_mu + E_nu\n139.6 MeV = (m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu) + (p c)\n\nAnd conservation of momentum says that the momenta are equal and opposite. So, the magnitude of the muon's momentum is p, and the neutrino's is p. So, the muon's momentum is p, and the neutrino's is also p, but in opposite direction.\n\nNow, for the muon, using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E_mu\u00b2 = (p c)\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)\u00b2. Wait, no, the correct equation is E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2. Wait, no, units get confusing. Let me write it correctly. The energy squared is equal to the square of the momentum times c squared plus the square of the rest mass energy squared.\n\nSo,\n\nE_mu\u00b2 = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2.\n\nBut E_mu is m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu. So,\n\n(m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu)^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n(m_mu\u00b2 c^4 + 2 m_mu c\u00b2 K_mu + K_mu\u00b2) = (p^2 c^2) + m_mu\u00b2 c^4.\n\nSubtract m_mu\u00b2 c^4 from both sides:\n\n2 m_mu c\u00b2 K_mu + K_mu\u00b2 = p\u00b2 c^2.\n\nBut from energy conservation earlier:\n\n139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + p c.\n\nWait, wait, let me express everything in MeV units. So m_pi c\u00b2 is 139.6 MeV, m_mu c\u00b2 is 105.7 MeV. Let me write everything in MeV and let c=1 for simplicity. So,\n\n139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + p.\n\nBut wait, in units where c=1, E is in MeV, mass is in MeV/c\u00b2, so m_mu c\u00b2 is 105.7 MeV. So, I can treat all energies as MeV, and momenta as MeV/c, but perhaps I'll set c=1 to simplify.\n\nSo, in c=1 units, the energy equation becomes:\n\n139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + p.\n\nBut from the muon's energy-momentum equation:\n\n(105.7 + K_mu)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n105.7^2 + 2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2.\n\nSubtract 105.7^2 from both sides:\n\n2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu^2 = p^2.\n\nSo p^2 = (2 * 105.7 * K_mu) + K_mu^2.\n\nNow, substitute p from the energy equation. From energy:\n\np = 139.6 - (105.7 + K_mu) = 139.6 - 105.7 - K_mu = 33.9 - K_mu.\n\nSo p = 33.9 - K_mu.\n\nSo p^2 = (33.9 - K_mu)^2.\n\nSetting that equal to the expression from the energy-momentum:\n\n(33.9 - K_mu)^2 = 2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu^2.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n(33.9)^2 - 2 * 33.9 * K_mu + K_mu^2 = 211.4 * K_mu + K_mu^2.\n\nWait, because 2*105.7 is 211.4. So,\n\n33.9^2 - 67.8 K_mu + K_mu^2 = 211.4 K_mu + K_mu^2.\n\nSubtract K_mu^2 from both sides:\n\n33.9^2 -67.8 K_mu = 211.4 K_mu.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n33.9^2 = 211.4 K_mu + 67.8 K_mu.\n\nWhich is:\n\n33.9^2 = (211.4 +67.8) K_mu.\n\nAdding 211.4 and 67.8: 279.2.\n\nSo,\n\nK_mu = (33.9^2) / 279.2.\n\nCalculating 33.9 squared: 33.9 * 33.9.\n\nLet me compute that: 33^2 is 1089, 0.9^2 is 0.81, and cross terms 2*33*0.9 = 59.4. So,\n\n(33 + 0.9)^2 = 33^2 + 2*33*0.9 + 0.9^2 = 1089 + 59.4 + 0.81 = 1149.21.\n\nSo,\n\nK_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n279.2 times 4 is 1116.8, which is less than 1149.21. 4.1 is 279.2 *4.1= 1144.72. Hmm, 4.1 gives 1144.72. 4.12: 279.2 *0.02=5.584 \u2192 1144.72 +5.584= 1150.304, which is a bit higher than 1149.21.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 1149.21 / 279.2 exactly.\n\nLet me compute 279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. The difference is 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41.\n\n32.41 / 279.2 \u2248 0.116.\n\nSo, K_mu \u2248 4.116 MeV.\n\nWait, that's approximately 4.12 MeV. Hmm, looking at the options, option D gives 4.12 MeV for the first value. But wait, what's the second value? The second is for the neutrino.\n\nWait, the neutrino's energy is p c (with c=1, so p is in MeV/c, but since c=1, E = p). From earlier, p = 33.9 - K_mu. So K_mu is about 4.12, so p \u224833.9 -4.12=29.78 MeV.\n\nSo the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV. Wait, but the neutrino's kinetic energy is its total energy because its rest mass is negligible. So, the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.78 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that seems to match.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again to make sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe use conservation of energy and momentum more carefully.\n\nWait, since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the muon's momentum as p and the neutrino's as -p.\n\nSo, the muon's energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) = m_mu c^2 gamma, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe neutrino's energy is |p| c, since its mass is negligible.\n\nSo, the total energy is:\n\nm_pi c^2 = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c.\n\nLet me write m_pi c^2 as 139.6 MeV, m_mu c^2 as 105.7 MeV.\n\nSo,\n\n139.6 = sqrt( p\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2 ) + p.\n\nLet me denote x = p.\n\nSo,\n\n139.6 = sqrt(x\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) + x.\n\nLet me subtract x from both sides:\n\n139.6 - x = sqrt(x\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(139.6 - x)^2 = x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(139.6)^2 - 279.2 x = (105.7)^2.\n\nCompute 139.6^2: 139.6 * 139.6. Let me compute that.\n\n139^2 is 19321, 0.6^2 is 0.36, cross terms 2*139*0.6=166.8. So,\n\n(139 + 0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 +0.6^2 = 19321 + 166.8 +0.36= 19488.16.\n\nSimilarly, 105.7^2: 105^2 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, cross terms 2*105*0.7=147. So,\n\n(105 +0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 +0.49=11172.49.\n\nSo,\n\n19488.16 - 279.2 x = 11172.49.\n\nSubtract 11172.49 from both sides:\n\n19488.16 -11172.49 = 279.2 x.\n\nCompute 19488.16 -11172.49:\n\n19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nSo,\n\n8315.67 = 279.2 x \u2192 x = 8315.67 / 279.2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376 -279.2=8096.8. Hmm, but 8315.67 is less than that. Wait, perhaps 29.7.\n\nWait, 279.2 *29 = 279.2 *20=5584, 279.2 *9=2512.8 \u2192 5584+2512.8=8096.8.\n\nDifference between 8315.67 and 8096.8 is 218.87.\n\nSo 218.87 / 279.2 \u2248 0.783. So x \u2248 29.783.\n\nSo p \u224829.783 MeV/c.\n\nSo the neutrino's energy is p c =29.783 MeV.\n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt( p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ) = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) \u2248 sqrt(887.07 + 11172.49 ) = sqrt(12059.56) \u2248109.81 MeV.\n\nSo the muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 -105.7 \u22484.11 MeV. So that's about 4.12 MeV, which matches option D.\n\nSo the KE of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is \"4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.\" So that's the correct choice.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary positively charged pion (Pi\u207a) into a positively charged muon (mu\u207a) and a neutrino (nu).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to remember what I learned in my classes. \n\nThe problem says that a Pi(+) meson is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. Wait, and what about the neutrino? Oh right, neutrinos are super light, like their rest mass is negligible compared to these particles. So I can probably ignore it in calculations.\n\nSince the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino after decay must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to keep the total momentum zero. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino's mass is so tiny, its momentum would be approximately equal in magnitude to the muon's, but opposite in direction.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the kinetic energies? I remember that in particle decay problems, the key is to use conservation of energy and momentum. Because the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV.\n\nAfter decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is negligible. So:\n\nTotal energy after = E_mu + E_nu = (K_mu + m_mu c\u00b2) + (K_nu + m_nu c\u00b2)\n\nBut since m_nu is practically zero, we can ignore m_nu c\u00b2. So E_nu \u2248 K_nu. \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n139.6 MeV = (K_mu + 105.7 MeV) + K_nu\n\nBut we also know that the total momentum must be zero. So the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p, but opposite in direction. \n\nThe energy of each particle can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2. \n\nFor the muon:\nE_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nAnd for the neutrino:\nE_nu = p c (since m_nu \u2248 0, so E \u2248 pc )\n\nWait, but wait, neutrinos are relativistic particles usually, so E_nu = p c. So substituting into the energy equation:\n\n139.6 = [sqrt( p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 ) ] + (p c )\n\nBut since the units are in MeV, I can ignore the c's because when using MeV and MeV/c, the c factors get normalized. So let me write it without c:\n\n139.6 = sqrt( p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p\n\nHmm, that's the equation I need to solve for p. Let me denote x = p, so:\n\n139.6 = sqrt(x\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) + x\n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Let's move x to the other side:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) = 139.6 - x\n\nNow, square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\nx\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x + x\u00b2\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x\u00b2\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n105.7\u00b2 = 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6 x\n\nLet me compute the squares:\n\n105.7^2 = approx (105)^2 is 11025, but precise calculation: 105.7 *105.7. Let me compute:\n\n105 *105 = 11025. 0.7 *105 = 73.5. So (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105\u00b2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7\u00b2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, 139.6^2: Let me calculate. 140^2 is 19600. Subtract (0.4)^2 and account for the cross terms. Wait, 139.6 is 140 - 0.4.\n\nSo (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 * x\n\nLet me compute 2 *139.6 = 279.2.\n\nSo:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x\n\nSubtract 19488.16 from both sides:\n\n11172.49 -19488.16 = -279.2 x\n\nCompute 11172.49 -19488.16: Let's see, 19488 - 11172 is 8316. So 11172.49 is less than 19488.16 by 8315.67. So:\n\n-8315.67 = -279.2 x\n\nDivide both sides by -279.2:\n\nx = (8315.67) / 279.2 \u2248 Let me compute that.\n\nLet me do the division: 8315.67 / 279.2.\n\nApproximately, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376, minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8 \u2192 which is less than 8315. So 29 gives 8096.8, 30 gives 8376.\n\nDifference: 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87. \n\nSo 279.2 * 0.78 \u2248 218.8 (since 279.2 *0.7=195.44, 0.08 *279.2=22.336 \u2192 total 217.776). Close enough.\n\nSo x\u224829.78? Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *20 =5584, 279.2 *9=2512.8 \u2192 total 8096.8.\n\nWe have 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87. So 218.87 / 279.2 = approx 0.782.\n\nSo x\u224829.78 + 0.782 = 30.562. So approximately 30.56 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but wait, that's p, the momentum of the muon. So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (m_mu)^2 ) = sqrt( (30.56)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nWait, let's compute 30.56^2: approx 30^2=900, 0.56^2=0.3136, 2*30*0.56=33.6 \u2192 (30.56)^2\u2248933. So 933 + (105.7)^2 = 933 + 11172.49 = 12105.49. So sqrt(12105.49) \u2248 110 MeV. Because 110^2 is 12100. So E_mu \u2248110.0 MeV.\n\nWait, but m_mu is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy K_mu is E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2 \u2192 110 -105.7 =4.3 MeV.\n\nWait, but that seems low. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, wait, let me go back. Did I make a mistake in solving for x?\n\nWait, the equation after substitution:\n\nx\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side: 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6 x +x\u00b2.\n\nSo subtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n105.7\u00b2 = 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6 x.\n\nSo 2*139.6 x = 139.6\u00b2 -105.7\u00b2.\n\nWhich is 2*139.6 x = (139.6 -105.7)(139.6 +105.7).\n\nCompute 139.6 -105.7 =33.9, 139.6+105.7=245.3.\n\nSo 33.9 *245.3 = let's compute that.\n\n33 *245 = 8115, 0.9 *245=220.5 \u2192 8115+220.5=8335.5. So approximately 8335.5 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo 2*139.6 x =8335.5 \u2192 x = 8335.5/(2*139.6) \u2192 8335.5 /279.2 \u2192 let me compute that.\n\nCompute 279.2 *29 = 8096.8 (as before). 8335.5-8096.8=238.7.\n\n238.7 /279.2 \u2248 0.855.\n\nSo x=29.855 MeV/c. Approximately 29.86 MeV/c.\n\nSo p \u224829.86 MeV/c.\n\nNow, E_mu = sqrt( (29.86)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nCalculate 29.86^2: approx 29^2=841, 0.86^2=0.7396, 2*29*0.86=49.88 \u2192 841 +49.88 +0.7396= 891.6196.\n\n105.7^2=11172.49.\n\nSo E_mu^2 = 891.6196 +11172.49 = 12064.11. So sqrt(12064.11)= approx 109.83 MeV.\n\nSo E_mu \u2248109.83 MeV. Then K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2 \u2192 109.83 -105.7=4.13 MeV.\n\nWait, that's around 4.13 MeV. So the kinetic energy of the muon is about 4.13 MeV.\n\nWhat about the neutrino's kinetic energy? Since the total energy is 139.6 MeV, and E_mu is 109.83 MeV, E_nu =139.6 -109.83=29.77 MeV.\n\nSo K_mu \u22484.13 MeV, K_nu\u224829.77 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D:4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV \u2192 that matches closely. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have messed up the algebra.\n\nWait, another way to compute x:\n\nCompute 139.6\u00b2 -105.7\u00b2 = (139.6 -105.7)(139.6 +105.7) \u2192 33.9 *245.3 = Let me compute 33 *245=8115, 33*0.3=9.9, 0.9*245=220.5, 0.9*0.3=0.27. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 33.9 *245.3.\n\n33.9 *245 = let's see, 30 *245=7350, 3.9 *245=955.5 \u2192 total 7350+955.5=8305.5.\n\n33.9 *0.3=10.17. So total 8305.5 +10.17=8315.67.\n\nSo yes, 2*139.6 x =8315.67 \u2192 x=8315.67/(279.2)= approx 29.86 MeV/c.\n\nSo E_mu = sqrt(29.86^2 +105.7^2 )= sqrt(891.6 +11172.49)= sqrt(12064.09) \u2192 approx 109.83 MeV.\n\nSo K_mu is 109.83 -105.7=4.13 MeV.\n\nE_nu=139.6 -109.83=29.77 MeV.\n\nSo the neutrino has about 29.77 MeV of energy, which is its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.\n\nLooking at the options, option D says 4.12 and 29.8 MeV, which is very close to my calculations. So the correct answer should be option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to remember what I learned in my classes. \n\nThe problem says that a Pi(+) meson is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. Wait, and what about the neutrino? Oh right, neutrinos are super light, like their rest mass is negligible compared to these particles. So I can probably ignore it in calculations.\n\nSince the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino after decay must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to keep the total momentum zero. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino's mass is so tiny, its momentum would be approximately equal in magnitude to the muon's, but opposite in direction.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the kinetic energies? I remember that in particle decay problems, the key is to use conservation of energy and momentum. Because the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV.\n\nAfter decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is negligible. So:\n\nTotal energy after = E_mu + E_nu = (K_mu + m_mu c\u00b2) + (K_nu + m_nu c\u00b2)\n\nBut since m_nu is practically zero, we can ignore m_nu c\u00b2. So E_nu \u2248 K_nu. \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n139.6 MeV = (K_mu + 105.7 MeV) + K_nu\n\nBut we also know that the total momentum must be zero. So the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p, but opposite in direction. \n\nThe energy of each particle can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2. \n\nFor the muon:\nE_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nAnd for the neutrino:\nE_nu = p c (since m_nu \u2248 0, so E \u2248 pc )\n\nWait, but wait, neutrinos are relativistic particles usually, so E_nu = p c. So substituting into the energy equation:\n\n139.6 = [sqrt( p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 ) ] + (p c )\n\nBut since the units are in MeV, I can ignore the c's because when using MeV and MeV/c, the c factors get normalized. So let me write it without c:\n\n139.6 = sqrt( p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p\n\nHmm, that's the equation I need to solve for p. Let me denote x = p, so:\n\n139.6 = sqrt(x\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) + x\n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Let's move x to the other side:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) = 139.6 - x\n\nNow, square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\nx\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x + x\u00b2\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x\u00b2\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n105.7\u00b2 = 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6 x\n\nLet me compute the squares:\n\n105.7^2 = approx (105)^2 is 11025, but precise calculation: 105.7 *105.7. Let me compute:\n\n105 *105 = 11025. 0.7 *105 = 73.5. So (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105\u00b2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7\u00b2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, 139.6^2: Let me calculate. 140^2 is 19600. Subtract (0.4)^2 and account for the cross terms. Wait, 139.6 is 140 - 0.4.\n\nSo (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 * x\n\nLet me compute 2 *139.6 = 279.2.\n\nSo:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x\n\nSubtract 19488.16 from both sides:\n\n11172.49 -19488.16 = -279.2 x\n\nCompute 11172.49 -19488.16: Let's see, 19488 - 11172 is 8316. So 11172.49 is less than 19488.16 by 8315.67. So:\n\n-8315.67 = -279.2 x\n\nDivide both sides by -279.2:\n\nx = (8315.67) / 279.2 \u2248 Let me compute that.\n\nLet me do the division: 8315.67 / 279.2.\n\nApproximately, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376, minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8 \u2192 which is less than 8315. So 29 gives 8096.8, 30 gives 8376.\n\nDifference: 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87. \n\nSo 279.2 * 0.78 \u2248 218.8 (since 279.2 *0.7=195.44, 0.08 *279.2=22.336 \u2192 total 217.776). Close enough.\n\nSo x\u224829.78? Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *20 =5584, 279.2 *9=2512.8 \u2192 total 8096.8.\n\nWe have 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87. So 218.87 / 279.2 = approx 0.782.\n\nSo x\u224829.78 + 0.782 = 30.562. So approximately 30.56 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but wait, that's p, the momentum of the muon. So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (m_mu)^2 ) = sqrt( (30.56)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nWait, let's compute 30.56^2: approx 30^2=900, 0.56^2=0.3136, 2*30*0.56=33.6 \u2192 (30.56)^2\u2248933. So 933 + (105.7)^2 = 933 + 11172.49 = 12105.49. So sqrt(12105.49) \u2248 110 MeV. Because 110^2 is 12100. So E_mu \u2248110.0 MeV.\n\nWait, but m_mu is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy K_mu is E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2 \u2192 110 -105.7 =4.3 MeV.\n\nWait, but that seems low. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, wait, let me go back. Did I make a mistake in solving for x?\n\nWait, the equation after substitution:\n\nx\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side: 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6 x +x\u00b2.\n\nSo subtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n105.7\u00b2 = 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6 x.\n\nSo 2*139.6 x = 139.6\u00b2 -105.7\u00b2.\n\nWhich is 2*139.6 x = (139.6 -105.7)(139.6 +105.7).\n\nCompute 139.6 -105.7 =33.9, 139.6+105.7=245.3.\n\nSo 33.9 *245.3 = let's compute that.\n\n33 *245 = 8115, 0.9 *245=220.5 \u2192 8115+220.5=8335.5. So approximately 8335.5 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo 2*139.6 x =8335.5 \u2192 x = 8335.5/(2*139.6) \u2192 8335.5 /279.2 \u2192 let me compute that.\n\nCompute 279.2 *29 = 8096.8 (as before). 8335.5-8096.8=238.7.\n\n238.7 /279.2 \u2248 0.855.\n\nSo x=29.855 MeV/c. Approximately 29.86 MeV/c.\n\nSo p \u224829.86 MeV/c.\n\nNow, E_mu = sqrt( (29.86)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nCalculate 29.86^2: approx 29^2=841, 0.86^2=0.7396, 2*29*0.86=49.88 \u2192 841 +49.88 +0.7396= 891.6196.\n\n105.7^2=11172.49.\n\nSo E_mu^2 = 891.6196 +11172.49 = 12064.11. So sqrt(12064.11)= approx 109.83 MeV.\n\nSo E_mu \u2248109.83 MeV. Then K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2 \u2192 109.83 -105.7=4.13 MeV.\n\nWait, that's around 4.13 MeV. So the kinetic energy of the muon is about 4.13 MeV.\n\nWhat about the neutrino's kinetic energy? Since the total energy is 139.6 MeV, and E_mu is 109.83 MeV, E_nu =139.6 -109.83=29.77 MeV.\n\nSo K_mu \u22484.13 MeV, K_nu\u224829.77 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D:4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV \u2192 that matches closely. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have messed up the algebra.\n\nWait, another way to compute x:\n\nCompute 139.6\u00b2 -105.7\u00b2 = (139.6 -105.7)(139.6 +105.7) \u2192 33.9 *245.3 = Let me compute 33 *245=8115, 33*0.3=9.9, 0.9*245=220.5, 0.9*0.3=0.27. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 33.9 *245.3.\n\n33.9 *245 = let's see, 30 *245=7350, 3.9 *245=955.5 \u2192 total 7350+955.5=8305.5.\n\n33.9 *0.3=10.17. So total 8305.5 +10.17=8315.67.\n\nSo yes, 2*139.6 x =8315.67 \u2192 x=8315.67/(279.2)= approx 29.86 MeV/c.\n\nSo E_mu = sqrt(29.86^2 +105.7^2 )= sqrt(891.6 +11172.49)= sqrt(12064.09) \u2192 approx 109.83 MeV.\n\nSo K_mu is 109.83 -105.7=4.13 MeV.\n\nE_nu=139.6 -109.83=29.77 MeV.\n\nSo the neutrino has about 29.77 MeV of energy, which is its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.\n\nLooking at the options, option D says 4.12 and 29.8 MeV, which is very close to my calculations.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, let's see. The problem is Pi(+) at rest decays into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. And the options are A to D with various KE values.\n\nWait, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero, so the products must have equal and opposite momenta. But neutrinos are tricky because they have very small mass, almost considered massless. Oh wait, but in this case, the muon and the neutrino would share the momentum.\n\nSo the process is Pi+ \u2192 mu+ + nu. Since Pi is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But because the neutrino's mass is negligible, maybe we can approximate it as having no mass, but wait, I think in reality, neutrinos do have mass, but for this problem, perhaps we can ignore it? Or do I need to consider it?\n\nWait, the problem gives the rest mass of Pi and mu, but nothing about the neutrino. So probably, we should treat the neutrino as having negligible mass compared to the muon. So, the neutrino's rest mass is zero in this context.\n\nSo the energy and momentum conservation equations apply here. Let's denote the energies and momenta of the muon and neutrino as E_mu, p_mu and E_nu, p_nu.\n\nSince the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since momentum is a vector, their magnitudes are the same: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.\n\nWait, but if the neutrino is massless, then E_nu = |p_nu| * c, but in units where c=1, it's E = p. Similarly, the muon's energy is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu. Again, with c=1, E_mu = m_mu + K_mu.\n\nSo, the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi c\u00b2 = 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu.\n\nSo,\n\nm_pi = E_mu + E_nu\n139.6 = (m_mu + K_mu) + E_nu\n\nBut since E_nu = p (because it's massless), and p_mu = p (since their magnitudes are same and opposite), and for the muon, the energy is also sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but again, in units where c=1, it's sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2).\n\nSo, E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2)\n\nE_nu = p\n\nSo substituting into the energy equation:\n\n139.6 = sqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + p\n\nWait, that's a bit complicated equation. Let me write it again.\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6\n\nLet me call sqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) as A. So A + p = 139.6\n\nBut A is sqrt(p\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2), so perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\nBut wait, let's rearrange the equation first. Let me subtract p from both sides:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) = 139.6 - p\n\nNow, square both sides:\n\np\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2\n\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\n(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p + p\u00b2\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\np\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p + p\u00b2\n\nSubtract p\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n105.7\u00b2 = 139.6\u00b2 - 2 * 139.6 * p\n\nLet me compute these squares.\n\n139.6^2: Let's see, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\n105.7^2: 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 * p\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n2 * 139.6 * p = 19488.16 - 11172.49\n\nCompute 19488.16 - 11172.49: Let me subtract.\n\n19488.16\n-11172.49\n= 8315.67\n\nSo,\n\n2 * 139.6 * p = 8315.67\n\nCompute 2*139.6: 279.2\n\nSo,\n\n279.2 * p = 8315.67\n\np = 8315.67 / 279.2\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2 *30 is 8376, minus 279.2 *0.2=55.84 \u2192 8376 -55.84= 8320.16. Which is very close to 8315.67. So 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So maybe p is about 29.78 or so.\n\nWait, but let me compute it accurately.\n\n8315.67 / 279.2 \u2192 Let me divide 8315.67 by 279.2.\n\nWell, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 (because 279 *30 is 8370, minus 279 gives 8091, plus 0.2*29=5.8 \u2192 8091+5.8=8096.8).\n\nSo 29 \u2192 8096.8. The difference is 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.\n\n218.87 /279.2 \u2192 approximately 0.782.\n\nSo p \u224829.782 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should carry out exact calculation.\n\nLet me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.\n\nWell, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.\n\nSubtract from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.\n\nSo 218.87 / 279.2 = approximately 0.782.\n\nSo p\u224829.782 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, 279.2 * 0.782 = ?\n\n0.7 *279.2=195.44,\n\n0.08 *279.2=22.336,\n\n0.002 *279.2=0.5584.\n\nSo sum: 195.44 +22.336=217.776 +0.5584=218.3344.\n\nSo 279.2 *0.782 =218.3344, which is a bit less than 218.87.\n\nThe difference is 218.87-218.3344=0.5356.\n\nSo 0.5356 /279.2 \u2192 approx 0.00192.\n\nSo total p is 29 +0.782 +0.00192 \u224829.7839 MeV/c.\n\nSo p\u224829.784 MeV/c.\n\nNow, back to the energy of the muon. E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2).\n\np=29.784, m_mu=105.7.\n\np\u00b2 = (29.784)^2 \u2192 Let's compute that.\n\n29^2=841,\n\n0.784^2\u22480.614,\n\n2*29*0.784=44.576.\n\nSo 29.784^2 \u2248 (29 +0.784)^2 = 29^2 + 2*29*0.784 +0.784^2 = 841 +44.576 +0.614\u2248 886.19 MeV\u00b2.\n\nm_mu^2 = (105.7)^2=11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo p\u00b2 + m_mu^2 =886.19 +11172.49\u224812058.68 MeV\u00b2.\n\nE_mu = sqrt(12058.68) \u2192 Let me compute that.\n\nWhat's sqrt(12058.68)?\n\nWell, 110^2=12100, which is 12100, which is 41.32 more than 12058.68.\n\nSo sqrt(12058.68) \u2248109.8 (since 109.8^2= (110-0.2)^2=110^2 - 2*110*0.2 +0.2^2=12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.\n\nHmm, 109.8^2=12056.04.\n\nBut our value is 12058.68, which is 2.64 higher. So each 0.1 increase in x adds approximately 2*109.8*0.1 + (0.1)^2=21.96 +0.01=21.97 per 0.1. Wait, that's for a small delta. Alternatively, let's think about it: from 109.8, the square is 12056.04. The target is 12058.68, which is 2.64 higher.\n\nSo how much more than 109.8 is needed? Let me call delta = x, so (109.8 + x)^2 \u2248 109.8^2 + 2*109.8*x = 12056.04 + 219.6 x.\n\nSet 219.6 x = 2.64 \u2192 x = 2.64 /219.6 \u2248 0.012.\n\nSo sqrt(12058.68) \u2248109.8 +0.012=109.812 MeV.\n\nSo E_mu \u2248109.812 MeV.\n\nWait, but m_mu is 105.7, so the KE of the muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.812 -105.7 =4.112 MeV. Approximately 4.11 MeV.\n\nAnd the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p \u224829.784 MeV.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. The total energy is E_mu + E_nu =109.812 +29.784\u2248139.596 MeV, which is about 139.6, matching the pion's rest energy. So that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D is 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I got.\n\nWait, but why isn't the neutrino's energy higher? Because the neutrino is taking away most of the energy? Wait, no, the muon's kinetic energy is about 4 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is about 29.8 MeV. So the muon's KE is 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero. So in the options, the KEs are for the product particles.\n\nSo the KE of the muon is 4.11 MeV, and the KE of the neutrino is 29.78 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches exactly. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but another thought. Wait, the problem says \"KE of product particles\". So each product's KE. So the muon's KE is ~4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's is ~29.8 MeV.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n",

And the options are A to D with various KE values.\n\nWait, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved.

Similarly, the muon's energy is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu. Again, with c=1, E_mu = m_mu + K_mu.\n\nSo, the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi c\u00b2 = 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu.\n\nSo,\n\nm_pi = E_mu + E_nu\n139.6 = (m_mu + K_mu) + E_nu\n\nBut since E_nu = p (because it's massless), and p_mu = p (since their magnitudes are same and opposite), and for the muon, the energy is also sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but again, in units where c=1, it's sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2).\n\nSo, E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2)\n\nE_nu = p\n\nSo substituting into the energy equation:\n\n139.6 = sqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + p\n\nWait, that's a bit complicated equation. Let me write it again.\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6\n\nLet me call sqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) as A. So A + p = 139.6\n\nBut A is sqrt(p\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2), so perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\nBut wait, let's rearrange the equation first. Let me subtract p from both sides:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) = 139.6 - p\n\nNow, square both sides:\n\np\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2\n\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\n(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p + p\u00b2\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\np\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p + p\u00b2\n\nSubtract p\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n105.7\u00b2 = 139.6\u00b2 - 2 * 139.6 * p\n\nLet me compute these squares.\n\n139.6^2: Let's see, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\n105.7^2: 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 * p\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n2 * 139.6 * p = 19488.16 - 11172.49\n\nCompute 19488.16 - 11172.49: Let me subtract.\n\n19488.16\n-11172.49\n= 8315.67\n\nSo,\n\n2 * 139.6 * p = 8315.67\n\nCompute 2*139.6: 279.2\n\nSo,\n\n279.2 * p = 8315.67\n\np = 8315.67 / 279.2\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2 *30 is 8376, minus 279.2 *0.2=55.84 \u2192 8376 -55.84= 8320.16. Which is very close to 8315.67. So 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So maybe p is about 29.78 or so.\n\nWait, but let me compute it accurately.\n\n8315.67 / 279.2 \u2192 Let me divide 8315.67 by 279.2.\n\nWell, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 (because 279 *30 is 8370, minus 279 gives 8091, plus 0.2*29=5.8 \u2192 8091+5.8=8096.8).\n\nSo 29 \u2192 8096.8. The difference is 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.\n\n218.87 /279.2 \u2192 approximately 0.782.\n\nSo p \u224829.782 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should carry out exact calculation.\n\nLet me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.\n\nWell, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.\n\nSubtract from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.\n\nSo 218.87 / 279.2 = approximately 0.782.\n\nSo p\u224829.782 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, 279.2 * 0.782 = ?\n\n0.7 *279.2=195.44,\n\n0.08 *279.2=22.336,\n\n0.002 *279.2=0.5584.\n\nSo sum: 195.44 +22.336=217.776 +0.5584=218.3344.\n\nSo 279.2 *0.782 =218.3344, which is a bit less than 218.87.\n\nThe difference is 218.87-218.3344=0.5356.\n\nSo 0.5356 /279.2 \u2192 approx 0.00192.\n\nSo total p is 29 +0.782 +0.00192 \u224829.7839 MeV/c.\n\nSo p\u224829.784 MeV/c.\n\nNow, back to the energy of the muon. E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2).\n\np=29.784, m_mu=105.7.\n\np\u00b2 = (29.784)^2 \u2192 Let's compute that.\n\n29^2=841,\n\n0.784^2\u22480.614,\n\n2*29*0.784=44.576.\n\nSo 29.784^2 \u2248 (29 +0.784)^2 = 29^2 + 2*29*0.784 +0.784^2 = 841 +44.576 +0.614\u2248 886.19 MeV\u00b2.\n\nm_mu^2 = (105.7)^2=11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo p\u00b2 + m_mu^2 =886.19 +11172.49\u224812058.68 MeV\u00b2.\n\nE_mu = sqrt(12058.68) \u2192 Let me compute that.\n\nWhat's sqrt(12058.68)?\n\nWell, 110^2=12100, which is 12100, which is 41.32 more than 12058.68.\n\nSo sqrt(12058.68) \u2248109.8 (since 109.8^2= (110-0.2)^2=110^2 - 2*110*0.2 +0.2^2=12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.\n\nHmm, 109.8^2=12056.04.\n\nBut our value is 12058.68, which is 2.64 higher. So each 0.1 increase in x adds approximately 2*109.8*0.1 + (0.1)^2=21.96 +0.01=21.97 per 0.1. Wait, that's for a small delta. Alternatively, let's think about it: from 109.8, the square is 12056.04. The target is 12058.68, which is 2.64 higher.\n\nSo how much more than 109.8 is needed? Let me call delta = x, so (109.8 + x)^2 \u2248 109.8^2 + 2*109.8*x = 12056.04 + 219.6 x.\n\nSet 219.6 x = 2.64 \u2192 x = 2.64 /219.6 \u2248 0.012.\n\nSo sqrt(12058.68) \u2248109.8 +0.012=109.812 MeV.\n\nSo E_mu \u2248109.812 MeV.\n\nWait, but m_mu is 105.7, so the KE of the muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.812 -105.7 =4.112 MeV. Approximately 4.11 MeV.\n\nAnd the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p \u224829.784 MeV.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. The total energy is E_mu + E_nu =109.812 +29.784\u2248139.596 MeV, which is about 139.6, matching the pion's rest energy. So that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D is 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I got.\n\nWait, but why isn't the neutrino's energy higher? Because the neutrino is taking away most of the energy? Wait, no, the muon's kinetic energy is about 4 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is about 29.8 MeV. So the muon's KE is 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero. So in the options, the KEs are for the product particles.\n\nSo the KE of the muon is 4.11 MeV, and the KE of the neutrino is 29.78 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches exactly. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but another thought. Wait, the problem says \"KE of product particles\". So each product's KE. So the muon's KE is ~4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's is ~29.8 MeV.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine the kinetic energies of the products in the decay of a stationary pion, we use energy and momentum conservation. The decay process is:\n\n\\[\n\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu\n\\]\n\n### Key Information:\n- Rest mass of the pion: \\( m_{\\pi^+} = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV} \\)\n- Rest mass of the muon: \\( m_{\\mu^+} = 105.7 \\, \\text{MeV} \\)\n- Neutrino mass is negligible (\\( m_\\nu \\approx 0 \\)).\n\n### Energy Conservation:\nThe total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{total}} = m_{\\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n\\]\n\nAfter decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy (\\( E_\\mu \\)) and the neutrino's energy (\\( E_\\nu \\)):\n\\[\nE_{\\text{total}} = E_\\mu + E_\\nu.\n\\]\n\n### Momentum Conservation:\nSince the pion is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me think. The reaction is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, right? And the pion is at rest initially.\n\nWait, the given masses are the rest masses. The pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's is 105.7 MeV. Oh, but neutrinos are tricky because their mass is usually considered negligible, especially in these kinds of problems. So I guess I can treat the neutrino as massless for this calculation.\n\nSo, the pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That means their magnitudes of momentum should be the same. But wait, the neutrino is massless, so its energy would just be equal to its momentum (since E = pc for massless particles). The muon, on the other hand, has rest mass, so its energy will be more than its momentum.\n\nLet me think about the energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino.\n\nSo, the muon's energy is its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero.\n\nLet me denote the energies as E_mu and E_nu. So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's say the muon's momentum is p, then the neutrino's is -p. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, p_mu = p_nu = p.\n\nThe energy of the muon is given by E_mu = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, the units here are in MeV, and I think we can work in units where c=1 for simplicity. So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p, since it's massless.\n\nSo substituting into energy conservation: sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.\n\nHmm, that's an equation in p. Let me write that down:\n\nsqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) + p = 139.6.\n\nI need to solve for p. Maybe I can let x = p, then the equation becomes sqrt(x^2 + 105.7^2) = 139.6 - x.\n\nThen I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. So:\n\nx^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.\n\nSo, x^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.\n\nHmm, the x^2 terms cancel out. That leaves:\n\n105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x.\n\nLet me compute the numbers. 105.7 squared is approximately (105)^2 is 11025, but 105.7 is a bit more. Let me compute 105.7^2: 105 *105 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, and cross terms 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49. So approximately 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, 139.6^2: Let's compute that. 140^2 is 19600. But 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. So (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2. So 140\u00b2 is 19600, 2ab = 2*140*0.4=112, and b\u00b2=0.16. So 139.6^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.\n\nSo plugging into the equation:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 * x.\n\nLet me rearrange to solve for x:\n\n2*139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.\n\nCalculate the right side: 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let me subtract:\n\n19488.16\n-11172.49\n= 8315.67.\n\nSo 2 * 139.6 x = 8315.67 \u2192 279.2 x = 8315.67.\n\nDivide both sides by 279.2:\n\nx \u2248 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n279.2 * 30 = 8376 \u2192 that's a bit higher than 8315. So 279.2 * 29.8 = ?\n\nWait, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8, 279.2 * 0.8= 223.36 \u2192 8096.8 + 223.36 = 8320.16. Oh, that's close to 8315.67. So x is approximately 29.8 - but wait, 279.2 * 29.8 is 8320.16, but our target is 8315.67 which is a bit less.\n\nWait, perhaps 29.78?\n\nWait, 279.2 * 29.8 = 8320.16. The difference between 8320.16 and 8315.67 is 4.49. So 279.2 * delta = 4.49 \u2192 delta \u2248 4.49 / 279.2 \u2248 0.016. So x \u2248 29.8 - 0.016 \u2248 29.784.\n\nSo p \u2248 29.784 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but wait, the neutrino's energy is p, which is about 29.784 MeV.\n\nThe muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).\n\nCompute 29.784^2: approx 887. (30^2 is 900, so 29.784^2 is about 887.)\n\n105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.\n\nSo sum is 887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49.\n\nSquare root of that is sqrt(12059.49) \u2248 let's see. 110^2 = 12100. So sqrt(12059.49) is about 109.8.\n\nWait, 109.8^2 = 12056.04, which is close. So E_mu \u2248 109.8 MeV.\n\nWait, but the total energy should be E_mu + E_nu = 109.8 + 29.784 \u2248 139.584 MeV, which is close to 139.6 MeV. So that makes sense.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2. Since m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2, the kinetic energy is 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV approximately.\n\nWait, 109.8 minus 105.7 is 4.1 MeV.\n\nAnd the neutrino's kinetic energy is p, which is approximately 29.784 MeV. So the muon's KE is about 4.1 MeV, neutrino's KE about 29.8 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.\n\nThat matches. So the correct answer should be D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me think. The reaction is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, right? And the pion is at rest initially.\n\nWait, the given masses are the rest masses. The pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's is 105.7 MeV. Oh, but neutrinos are tricky because their mass is usually considered negligible, especially in these kinds of problems. So I guess I can treat the neutrino as massless for this calculation.\n\nSo, the pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That means their magnitudes of momentum should be the same. But wait, the neutrino is massless, so its energy would just be equal to its momentum (since E = pc for massless particles). The muon, on the other hand, has rest mass, so its energy will be more than its momentum.\n\nLet me think about the energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino.\n\nSo, the muon's energy is its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero.\n\nLet me denote the energies as E_mu and E_nu. So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's say the muon's momentum is p, then the neutrino's is -p. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, p_mu = p_nu = p.\n\nThe energy of the muon is given by E_mu = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, the units here are in MeV, and I think we can work in units where c=1 for simplicity. So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p, since it's massless.\n\nSo substituting into energy conservation: sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.\n\nHmm, that's an equation in p. Let me write that down:\n\nsqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) + p = 139.6.\n\nI need to solve for p. Maybe I can let x = p, then the equation becomes sqrt(x^2 + 105.7^2) = 139.6 - x.\n\nThen I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. So:\n\nx^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.\n\nSo, x^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.\n\nHmm, the x^2 terms cancel out. That leaves:\n\n105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x.\n\nLet me compute the numbers. 105.7 squared is approximately (105)^2 is 11025, but 105.7 is a bit more. Let me compute 105.7^2: 105 *105 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, and cross terms 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49. So approximately 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, 139.6^2: Let's compute that. 140^2 is 19600. But 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. So (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2. So 140\u00b2 is 19600, 2ab = 2*140*0.4=112, and b\u00b2=0.16. So 139.6^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.\n\nSo plugging into the equation:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 * x.\n\nLet me rearrange to solve for x:\n\n2*139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.\n\nCalculate the right side: 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let me subtract:\n\n19488.16\n-11172.49\n= 8315.67.\n\nSo 2 * 139.6 x = 8315.67 \u2192 279.2 x = 8315.67.\n\nDivide both sides by 279.2:\n\nx \u2248 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n279.2 * 30 = 8376 \u2192 that's a bit higher than 8315. So 279.2 * 29.8 = ?\n\nWait, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8, 279.2 * 0.8= 223.36 \u2192 8096.8 + 223.36 = 8320.16. Oh, that's close to 8315.67. So x is approximately 29.8 - but wait, 279.2 * 29.8 is 8320.16, but our target is 8315.67 which is a bit less.\n\nWait, perhaps 29.78?\n\nWait, 279.2 * 29.8 = 8320.16. The difference between 8320.16 and 8315.67 is 4.49. So 279.2 * delta = 4.49 \u2192 delta \u2248 4.49 / 279.2 \u2248 0.016. So x \u2248 29.8 - 0.016 \u2248 29.784.\n\nSo p \u2248 29.784 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but wait, the neutrino's energy is p, which is about 29.784 MeV.\n\nThe muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).\n\nCompute 29.784^2: approx 887. (30^2 is 900, so 29.784^2 is about 887.)\n\n105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.\n\nSo sum is 887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49.\n\nSquare root of that is sqrt(12059.49) \u2248 let's see. 110^2 = 12100. So sqrt(12059.49) is about 109.8.\n\nWait, 109.8^2 = 12056.04, which is close. So E_mu \u2248 109.8 MeV.\n\nWait, but the total energy should be E_mu + E_nu = 109.8 + 29.784 \u2248 139.584 MeV, which is close to 139.6 MeV. So that makes sense.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2. Since m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2, the kinetic energy is 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV approximately.\n\nWait, 109.8 minus 105.7 is 4.1 MeV.\n\nAnd the neutrino's kinetic energy is p, which is approximately 29.784 MeV. So the muon's KE is about 4.1 MeV, neutrino's KE about 29.8 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.\n\nThat matches. So the correct answer should be D.\n\n\nTo determine the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay process:\n\n\\[\n\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu\n\\]\n\nwe use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion (\\(\\pi^+\\)) is initially at rest, so its total energy is its rest energy, \\(E_{\\pi} = m_{\\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV}\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see if I can work through this.\n\nThe question says that the pion (Pi+) is stationary and decays into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV, mu+ is 105.7 MeV. So, I think the neutrino must be massless because in problems like this, neutrinos are often treated as having negligible mass. That's probably a safe assumption.\n\nThe task is to find the kinetic energy of the product particles. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to calculate the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When a particle at rest decays, the total momentum should be zero because the initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the decay products should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, the muon and the neutrino must have the same magnitude of momentum but opposite directions. That makes sense because momentum is conserved.\n\nSo, let's think about the energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nThe muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because it's massless. So, E_mu = m_mu * c^2 + K_mu. And E_nu = K_nu.\n\nSo, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = (m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu) + K_nu. This should equal the pion's rest energy, so:\n\n139.6 MeV = (105.7 MeV + K_mu) + K_nu.\n\nBut wait, also, momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.\n\nThe momentum of each particle can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. For the muon:\n\nE_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2.\n\nAnd for the neutrino:\n\nE_nu^2 = (p_nu c)^2.\n\nSince p_mu = p_nu in magnitude (and opposite direction), let's denote p as the magnitude of their momenta.\n\nSo, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c\u00b2? Wait, no, wait. Actually, E is in units of MeV, which already includes factors of c\u00b2. So, in natural units where c=1, the equations simplify. So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p, because m_nu is zero.\n\nSo, substituting into the energy equation:\n\n139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p.\n\nHmm, this looks like an equation in terms of p. Let's denote sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) as something. Let me rearrange the equation.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nsqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - p.\n\nNow, I'll square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\np^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\np^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2.\n\nI can subtract p^2 from both sides, which cancels out.\n\nSo,\n\n(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p.\n\nNow, let's compute the squares.\n\n105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let me compute that. 100^2 is 10,000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49. Cross terms: 2 * 100 *5.7 = 1140. So, (100+5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 +1140 +32.49 = 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\n139.6 squared: Let me compute that. 140^2 is 19600, but since it's 139.6, which is 140 -0.4.\n\nSo, (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600-112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 p.\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\n2*139.6 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.\n\nCompute the right side: 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let me subtract.\n\n19488.16\n-11172.49\n------------\n= 8315.67.\n\nSo,\n\n2 * 139.6 * p = 8315.67.\n\nCompute 2 *139.6: that's 279.2.\n\nSo,\n\np = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 Let me compute this.\n\nDivide 8315.67 by 279.2.\n\nLet me see, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 is 8376, minus 279.2 gives 8376-279.2=8096.8. Hmm, 29 times gives 8096.8.\n\nBut our numerator is 8315.67, which is larger than 8096.8.\n\nSo 29.5 times: 279.2 *29.5 = 279.2*(29 +0.5) = 8096.8 +139.6 = 8236.4.\n\nStill less than 8315.67.\n\nDifference: 8315.67 - 8236.4 = 79.27.\n\nSo, 79.27 /279.2 \u2248 0.284.\n\nSo total p\u224829.5 +0.284= 29.784.\n\nWait, wait, no, because 29.5 gives 8236.4, which is 79.27 less than 8315.67.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 8315.67 \u00f7 279.2.\n\nLet me approximate.\n\n279.2 \u00d7 29.8 \u2248 Let's compute 279.2 \u00d730 = 8376. So 29.8 is 30 -0.2.\n\nSo 279.2 \u00d729.8 = 8376 - (0.2 * 279.2) = 8376 -55.84 =8320.16.\n\nHmm, our numerator is 8315.67, which is 8320.16 -4.49.\n\nSo, 279.2 \u00d7 (29.8 - delta) = 8315.67.\n\nWe have 29.8 *279.2=8320.16.\n\nWe need 8315.67, which is 8320.16 -4.49.\n\nSo, 4.49 is the difference. So delta is (4.49)/(279.2) \u22480.016.\n\nSo p\u224829.8 -0.016=29.784.\n\nSo approximately 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but wait, the units. The momentum p is in MeV/c units, right? Because E is in MeV, and in natural units, E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4, so when E and m are in MeV, p is in MeV/c.\n\nSo p \u224829.78 MeV/c.\n\nNow, knowing p, we can find the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino.\n\nFor the neutrino, since it's massless, all its energy is kinetic. So K_nu = E_nu = p c. But in our units, p is in MeV/c, so E_nu = p * c. Wait, no, in units where c=1, E = p for massless particles. So E_nu = p, so K_nu = p =29.78 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think. The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c, but since we're using units where c is incorporated into the energy and mass measurements, maybe I'm mixing units here. Alternatively, perhaps in our setup, E (MeV) is equal to pc (since for massless particles, E=pc). So, E_nu = p c, but since our p is in MeV/c, E_nu would be (29.78 MeV/c) * c = 29.78 MeV. So yes, K_nu is 29.78 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait, the total energy of the neutrino is all kinetic, so K_nu = E_nu = p c = 29.78 MeV.\n\nFor the muon, its energy is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ). So, let's compute that.\n\np is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nm_mu is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nE_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nCompute each square:\n\n29.78^2 \u2248 886.8 (since 30^2=900, 29.78 is close to 30, so about 886.8).\n\n105.7^2 = 11172.49 as computed earlier.\n\nSo, sum is 886.8 +11172.49 = 12059.29.\n\nSquare root of that is sqrt(12059.29) \u2248 109.81 MeV.\n\nWait, because 109^2 is 11881, 110^2 is 12100. So sqrt(12059.29) is between 109 and 110. Let me compute 109.8^2 = (109 +0.8)^2 = 109^2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8^2=11881 +174.4 +0.64=12056.04. Hmm, which is close to 12059.29. The difference is 12059.29 -12056.04=3.25.\n\nSo, 109.8^2=12056.04.\n\nWe need sqrt(12059.29). Let's see, 109.8 + delta. Let delta be small.\n\n(109.8 + delta)^2 \u2248109.8^2 + 2*109.8*delta.\n\nWe have 12056.04 + 219.6 * delta = 12059.29.\n\nSo, 219.6 delta = 12059.29 -12056.04=3.25.\n\nSo, delta \u22483.25 /219.6 \u22480.0148.\n\nSo, E_mu \u2248109.8 +0.0148\u2248109.8148 MeV.\n\nSo, E_mu \u2248109.81 MeV.\n\nNow, the muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c^2 = 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait, E_mu is 109.81 MeV, and m_mu is 105.7, so K_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.\n\nSo, the muon's KE is approximately 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.78 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.\n\nHmm, that's very close to our calculations. So the KEs are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait, I thought the neutrino's KE would be 29.78, which is about 29.8. And the muon's is 4.11, which is about 4.12. So option D is the correct one.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, when I calculated p, I had:\n\np = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u224829.78 MeV/c.\n\nThen, for the neutrino, K_nu = p c (but in our units, since E is in MeV and p is in MeV/c, E_nu = p c would be (MeV/c)*c = MeV, which matches. So K_nu is 29.78 MeV.\n\nFor the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt(29.78^2 +105.7^2) \u2248 sqrt(886.8 +11172.49) = sqrt(12059.29)= ~109.81 MeV.\n\nSo, K_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.\n\nWhich matches option D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see if I can work through this.\n\nThe question says that the pion (Pi+) is stationary and decays into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV, mu+ is 105.7 MeV. So, I think the neutrino must be massless because in problems like this, neutrinos are often treated as having negligible mass. That's probably a safe assumption.\n\nThe task is to find the kinetic energy of the product particles. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to calculate the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When a particle at rest decays, the total momentum should be zero because the initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the decay products should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, the muon and the neutrino must have the same magnitude of momentum but opposite directions. That makes sense because momentum is conserved.\n\nSo, let's think about the energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nThe muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because it's massless. So, E_mu = m_mu * c^2 + K_mu. And E_nu = K_nu.\n\nSo, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = (m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu) + K_nu. This should equal the pion's rest energy, so:\n\n139.6 MeV = (105.7 MeV + K_mu) + K_nu.\n\nBut wait, also, momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.\n\nThe momentum of each particle can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. For the muon:\n\nE_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2.\n\nAnd for the neutrino:\n\nE_nu^2 = (p_nu c)^2.\n\nSince p_mu = p_nu in magnitude (and opposite direction), let's denote p as the magnitude of their momenta.\n\nSo, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c\u00b2? Wait, no, wait. Actually, E is in units of MeV, which already includes factors of c\u00b2. So, in natural units where c=1, the equations simplify. So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p, because m_nu is zero.\n\nSo, substituting into the energy equation:\n\n139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p.\n\nHmm, this looks like an equation in terms of p. Let's denote sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) as something. Let me rearrange the equation.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nsqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - p.\n\nNow, I'll square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\np^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\np^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2.\n\nI can subtract p^2 from both sides, which cancels out.\n\nSo,\n\n(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p.\n\nNow, let's compute the squares.\n\n105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let me compute that. 100^2 is 10,000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49. Cross terms: 2 * 100 *5.7 = 1140. So, (100+5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 +1140 +32.49 = 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\n139.6 squared: Let me compute that. 140^2 is 19600, but since it's 139.6, which is 140 -0.4.\n\nSo, (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600-112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 p.\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\n2*139.6 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.\n\nCompute the right side: 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let me subtract.\n\n19488.16\n-11172.49\n------------\n= 8315.67.\n\nSo,\n\n2 * 139.6 * p = 8315.67.\n\nCompute 2 *139.6: that's 279.2.\n\nSo,\n\np = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 Let me compute this.\n\nDivide 8315.67 by 279.2.\n\nLet me see, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 is 8376, minus 279.2 gives 8376-279.2=8096.8. Hmm, 29 times gives 8096.8.\n\nBut our numerator is 8315.67, which is larger than 8096.8.\n\nSo 29.5 times: 279.2 *29.5 = 279.2*(29 +0.5) = 8096.8 +139.6 = 8236.4.\n\nStill less than 8315.67.\n\nDifference: 8315.67 - 8236.4 = 79.27.\n\nSo, 79.27 /279.2 \u2248 0.284.\n\nSo total p\u224829.5 +0.284= 29.784.\n\nWait, wait, no, because 29.5 gives 8236.4, which is 79.27 less than 8315.67.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 8315.67 \u00f7 279.2.\n\nLet me approximate.\n\n279.2 \u00d7 29.8 \u2248 Let's compute 279.2 \u00d730 = 8376. So 29.8 is 30 -0.2.\n\nSo 279.2 \u00d729.8 = 8376 - (0.2 * 279.2) = 8376 -55.84 =8320.16.\n\nHmm, our numerator is 8315.67, which is 8320.16 -4.49.\n\nSo, 279.2 \u00d7 (29.8 - delta) = 8315.67.\n\nWe have 29.8 *279.2=8320.16.\n\nWe need 8315.67, which is 8320.16 -4.49.\n\nSo, 4.49 is the difference. So delta is (4.49)/(279.2) \u22480.016.\n\nSo p\u224829.8 -0.016=29.784.\n\nSo approximately 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but wait, the units. The momentum p is in MeV/c units, right? Because E is in MeV, and in natural units, E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4, so when E and m are in MeV, p is in MeV/c.\n\nSo p \u224829.78 MeV/c.\n\nNow, knowing p, we can find the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino.\n\nFor the neutrino, since it's massless, all its energy is kinetic. So K_nu = E_nu = p c. But in our units, p is in MeV/c, so E_nu = p * c. Wait, no, in units where c=1, E = p for massless particles. So E_nu = p, so K_nu = p =29.78 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think. The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c, but since we're using units where c is incorporated into the energy and mass measurements, maybe I'm mixing units here. Alternatively, perhaps in our setup, E (MeV) is equal to pc (since for massless particles, E=pc). So, E_nu = p c, but since our p is in MeV/c, E_nu would be (29.78 MeV/c) * c = 29.78 MeV. So yes, K_nu is 29.78 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait, the total energy of the neutrino is all kinetic, so K_nu = E_nu = p c = 29.78 MeV.\n\nFor the muon, its energy is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ). So, let's compute that.\n\np is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nm_mu is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nE_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nCompute each square:\n\n29.78^2 \u2248 886.8 (since 30^2=900, 29.78 is close to 30, so about 886.8).\n\n105.7^2 = 11172.49 as computed earlier.\n\nSo, sum is 886.8 +11172.49 = 12059.29.\n\nSquare root of that is sqrt(12059.29) \u2248 109.81 MeV.\n\nWait, because 109^2 is 11881, 110^2 is 12100. So sqrt(12059.29) is between 109 and 110. Let me compute 109.8^2 = (109 +0.8)^2 = 109^2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8^2=11881 +174.4 +0.64=12056.04. Hmm, which is close to 12059.29. The difference is 12059.29 -12056.04=3.25.\n\nSo, 109.8^2=12056.04.\n\nWe need sqrt(12059.29). Let's see, 109.8 + delta. Let delta be small.\n\n(109.8 + delta)^2 \u2248109.8^2 + 2*109.8*delta.\n\nWe have 12056.04 + 219.6 * delta = 12059.29.\n\nSo, 219.6 delta = 12059.29 -12056.04=3.25.\n\nSo, delta \u22483.25 /219.6 \u22480.0148.\n\nSo, E_mu \u2248109.8 +0.0148\u2248109.8148 MeV.\n\nSo, E_mu \u2248109.81 MeV.\n\nNow, the muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c^2 = 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait, E_mu is 109.81 MeV, and m_mu is 105.7, so K_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.\n\nSo, the muon's KE is approximately 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.78 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.\n\nHmm, that's very close to our calculations. So the KEs are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait, I thought the neutrino's KE would be 29.78, which is about 29.8. And the muon's is 4.11, which is about 4.12. So option D is the correct one.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, when I calculated p, I had:\n\np = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u224829.78 MeV/c.\n\nThen, for the neutrino, K_nu = p c (but in our units, since E is in MeV and p is in MeV/c, E_nu = p c would be (MeV/c)*c = MeV, which matches. So K_nu is 29.78 MeV.\n\nFor the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt(29.78^2 +105.7^2) \u2248 sqrt(886.8 +11172.49) = sqrt(12059.29)= ~109.81 MeV.\n\nSo, K_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.\n\nWhich matches option D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion (\u03c0\u207a) into a muon (\u03bc\u207a) and a neutrino (\u03bd).
