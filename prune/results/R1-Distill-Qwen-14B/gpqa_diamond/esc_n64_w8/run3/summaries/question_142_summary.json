      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.\n\nThe question gives a density matrix \u03c1, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). And the question is about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are four points in 3D space, so I guess each option represents a point (x, y, z) in the Bloch sphere coordinates or something similar.\n\nWait, I remember that a qubit is a two-level system, and its state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. But density matrices are more general, representing mixed states as well as pure states. So the density matrix for a pure state would have a trace of 1 and be a projector, like |\u03c8><\u03c8|. For a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture.\n\nThe given \u03c1 is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That looks like an equal mixture of the |0> and |1> states. So each has a probability of 1/2. So this is a mixed state.\n\nBut how does this translate into the Bloch sphere representation? I think the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. The pure states |0> and |1> correspond to the poles of the sphere. |0> is (1,0,0) and |1> is (-1,0,0), wait no, wait, no. Wait, the Bloch vector for |0> is (1, 0, 0) and for |1> is (-1, 0, 0) because the Bloch sphere uses the Pauli matrices. Alternatively, sometimes the Bloch vector for |0> is (1,0,0), and |1> is (0,0,1), no, wait. I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. The Bloch sphere uses a vector (x,y,z) where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. So for a state |0>, the density matrix is |0><0|, which is [[1,0],[0,0]]. The expectation values are x = Tr(\u03c3x \u03c1), y = Tr(\u03c3y \u03c1), z = Tr(\u03c3z \u03c1). For |0>, \u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so \u03c3x |0> = |1>, but when you compute Tr(\u03c3x |0><0|) = 0. Similarly for \u03c3y, the trace would be zero. For \u03c3z, it's diagonal, so Tr(\u03c3z |0><0|) = 1. So the Bloch vector for |0> is (0, 0, 1).\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because I thought |0> is at (1,0,0). Hmm, perhaps I mixed up something. Alternatively, maybe the Bloch vector is (x, y, z) where x = <\u03c3x>, y = <\u03c3y>, z = <\u03c3z>. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the density matrix \u03c1 for |0> is diagonal with entries 1 and 0. So:\n\n\u03c3x = [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\u03c3y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]\n\u03c3z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nCompute Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3x) = 1*0 + 0*1 + 0*1 + 0*0 = 0. Similarly Tr(\u03c3y \u03c1) = 0. Tr(\u03c3z \u03c1) is 1*1 + 0*(-1) = 1. So the Bloch vector for |0> is (0, 0, 1). Similarly, for |1> the density matrix is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Tr(\u03c3x \u03c1) = 0, Tr(\u03c3y \u03c1)=0, Tr(\u03c3z \u03c1)= -1. So the Bloch vector is (0,0,-1). Oh wait, so that's the south pole.\n\nBut wait, I remember that in the Bloch sphere, |0> is at (1,0,0), but that can't be right because according to this calculation, it's at (0,0,1). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the axes mixed up. Alternatively, maybe the Bloch vector is represented as (x, y, z) where x is the expectation of \u03c3x, y of \u03c3y, z of \u03c3z. So for |0>, it's (0, 0, 1), which would be the north pole. For |1>, it's (0,0,-1), the south pole. Then, the density matrix given in the problem is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with 50% probability.\n\nWait, but the density matrix \u03c1 here is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So it's a completely mixed state, right? Because it's a classical mixture of the two basis states. In the Bloch sphere representation, a completely mixed state would be the completely depolarized state, which is at the center. Because the Bloch vector would be zero. Because the expectation values of \u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03c3z would all be zero. Because for each term, the expectation is zero.\n\nWait, let's compute this. \u03c1 = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2.\n\nSo for each Pauli matrix:\n\nTr(\u03c1 \u03c3x) = (1/2)(Tr(|0><0| \u03c3x) + Tr(|1><1| \u03c3x)).\n\nAs before, Tr(|0><0| \u03c3x) is 0, same for |1><1| \u03c3x. So overall, Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3x) = 0. Similarly for \u03c3y and \u03c3z, same thing. So the Bloch vector is (0, 0, 0). Which is the origin. So the point r is (0,0,0).\n\nLooking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, another thought. The density matrix given is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That's equivalent to (I)/2, since |0><0| + |1><1| is the identity matrix. So \u03c1 is I/2. That's a completely mixed state, which is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The maximally mixed state has zero Bloch vector, so it's at the origin. So yes, option C is correct.\n",

For a pure state, the state is on the surface of the sphere, and for mixed states, it's inside. But what's the position for this specific density matrix?\n\nThe Bloch vector representation comes into play here. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components (x, y, z). The general form is \u03c1 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2, where \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector.\n\nSo let me compute \u03c1 in terms of the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I is (1/2)(I) because when expanded, the identity term would be (I/2). The other terms are the Pauli matrices scaled by the components of r.\n\nLooking at the given \u03c1: it's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2.

Let me check the trace of \u03c1. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. Let me write out the matrix. |0> is a basis vector, say [1; 0], and |1> is [0; 1]. So |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the top left and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in the bottom right.

Because |0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere, |1><1| is 1 at (2,2), so adding them gives I, and then divided by 2 gives (I/2).\n\nSo \u03c1 = I/2. That's the maximally mixed state.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The given density matrix is \u03c1 = (1/2)(|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|). I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. But wait, what exactly does that mean?\n\nI think when a density matrix is a pure state, it can be written as |\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8|, right? And if it's a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture of pure states. But looking at the given \u03c1, it's \u00bd(|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|). Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh wait! That's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. So this state is completely mixed, meaning it's in a completely uncertain state between |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9.\n\nBut the question isn't directly about whether it's pure or mixed. It's asking about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh right, I think the density matrix can be represented as a point in a three-dimensional space because a qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrix has four elements but due to Hermiticity and trace 1, it's represented in a three-dimensional space.\n\nWait, how does that work? Let me recall. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is:\n\n\u03c1 = [[a, b; c, d]]\n\nBut since \u03c1 must be Hermitian, c = b*, and the trace a + d must equal 1. So the parameters are a, b, and c (with d=1-a). But since we're dealing with real parameters in this case, perhaps the representation in 3D space has coordinates based on the elements of \u03c1.\n\nWait, another approach: the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right! The Bloch sphere is a geometrical way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The maximally mixed state would be at the center of the sphere.\n\nSo, the maximally mixed state is (|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|)/2. Let me compute the components. The Bloch vector r is (x, y, z). For a density matrix \u03c1, the Bloch vector can be found using the formula:\n\nx = (\u03c1_{01} + \u03c1_{10}) / 2\ny = (\u03c1_{01} - \u03c1_{10}) / (2i)\nz = Tr(\u03c1 Z) ?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Alternatively, another formula comes to mind. The Bloch vector components are given by:\n\nr_x = (\u03c1_{01} + \u03c1_{10}) / 2\nr_y = (\u03c1_{01} - \u03c1_{10}) / (2i)\nr_z = (Tr(\u03c1 Z) )\n\nWait, but in the density matrix given, \u03c1 is diagonal. Let me write it out. |0\u27e9\u27e80| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1\u27e9\u27e81| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiplied by 1/2, we get [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So the density matrix is diagonal with entries \u00bd and \u00bd.\n\nSo \u03c1_{00} = \u00bd, \u03c1_{01}=0, \u03c1_{10}=0, \u03c1_{11}=\u00bd.\n\nNow, the Bloch vector is found using the coefficients. Let's compute each component.\n\nr_x = (\u03c1_{01} + \u03c1_{10}) / 2 = (0 + 0)/2 = 0.\nr_y = (\u03c1_{01} - \u03c1_{10}) / (2i) = (0 - 0)/(2i) = 0.\nr_z = Tr(\u03c1 Z), where Z is the Pauli matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So Tr(\u03c1 Z) is the sum of the diagonal elements of \u03c1 multiplied by Z's diagonal.\n\nWait, another approach: the z-component is (\u03c1_{00} - \u03c1_{11})/2. Because for the Pauli Z eigenvalues, |0\u27e9 has eigenvalue +1 and |1\u27e9 has -1. So \u03c1_z = (\u03c1_{00} - \u03c1_{11})/2.\n\nSo, plugging in the values: (\u00bd - \u00bd)/2 = 0. So the z-component is 0. Wait, but earlier I thought the maximally mixed state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, which is (0,0,0). But wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no, wait. The maximally mixed state is (|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|)/2, which is \u03c1 = I/2 where I is the identity matrix. So the Bloch vector for that would be all zeros. Because in the Bloch sphere, the state is represented as (I/2), which is the center.\n\nSo in this case, the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which would be the center.\n\nSo the correct answer must be option C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe given density matrix is \n\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| + \\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| \\right).\n\\]\n\nThis is the maximally mixed state for a qubit, which represents equal probability of the qubit being in the states \\(|0\\rangle\\) or \\(|1\\rangle\\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The given density matrix is \u03c1 = (1/2)(|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|). I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. But wait, what exactly does that mean?\n\nI think when a density matrix is a pure state, it can be written as |\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8|, right? And if it's a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture of pure states. But looking at the given \u03c1, it's \u00bd(|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|). Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh wait! That's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. So this state is completely mixed, meaning it's in a completely uncertain state between |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9.\n\nBut the question isn't directly about whether it's pure or mixed. It's asking about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh right, I think the density matrix can be represented as a point in a three-dimensional space because a qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrix has four elements but due to Hermiticity and trace 1, it's represented in a three-dimensional space.\n\nWait, how does that work? Let me recall. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is:\n\n\u03c1 = [[a, b; c, d]]\n\nBut since \u03c1 must be Hermitian, c = b*, and the trace a + d must equal 1. So the parameters are a, b, and c (with d=1-a). But since we're dealing with real parameters in this case, perhaps the representation in 3D space has coordinates based on the elements of \u03c1.\n\nWait, another approach: the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right! The Bloch sphere is a geometrical way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The maximally mixed state would be at the center of the sphere.\n\nSo, the maximally mixed state is (|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|)/2. Let me compute the components. The Bloch vector r is (x, y, z). For a density matrix \u03c1, the Bloch vector can be found using the formula:\n\nx = (\u03c1_{01} + \u03c1_{10}) / 2\ny = (\u03c1_{01} - \u03c1_{10}) / (2i)\nz = Tr(\u03c1 Z) ?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Alternatively, another formula comes to mind. The Bloch vector components are given by:\n\nr_x = (\u03c1_{01} + \u03c1_{10}) / 2\nr_y = (\u03c1_{01} - \u03c1_{10}) / (2i)\nr_z = (Tr(\u03c1 Z) )\n\nWait, but in the density matrix given, \u03c1 is diagonal. Let me write it out. |0\u27e9\u27e80| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1\u27e9\u27e81| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiplied by 1/2, we get [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So the density matrix is diagonal with entries \u00bd and \u00bd.\n\nSo \u03c1_{00} = \u00bd, \u03c1_{01}=0, \u03c1_{10}=0, \u03c1_{11}=\u00bd.\n\nNow, the Bloch vector is found using the coefficients. Let's compute each component.\n\nr_x = (\u03c1_{01} + \u03c1_{10}) / 2 = (0 + 0)/2 = 0.\nr_y = (\u03c1_{01} - \u03c1_{10}) / (2i) = (0 - 0)/(2i) = 0.\nr_z = Tr(\u03c1 Z), where Z is the Pauli matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So Tr(\u03c1 Z) is the sum of the diagonal elements of \u03c1 multiplied by Z's diagonal.\n\nWait, another approach: the z-component is (\u03c1_{00} - \u03c1_{11})/2. Because for the Pauli Z eigenvalues, |0\u27e9 has eigenvalue +1 and |1\u27e9 has -1. So \u03c1_z = (\u03c1_{00} - \u03c1_{11})/2.\n\nSo, plugging in the values: (\u00bd - \u00bd)/2 = 0. So the z-component is 0. Wait, but earlier I thought the maximally mixed state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, which is (0,0,0). But wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no, wait. The maximally mixed state is (|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|)/2, which is \u03c1 = I/2 where I is the identity matrix. So the Bloch vector for that would be all zeros. Because in the Bloch sphere, the state is represented as (I/2), which is the center.\n\nSo in this case, the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which would be the center.\n\nSo the correct answer must be option C.\n\n\nThe given density matrix is \n\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| + \\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| \\right).\n\\]\n\nThis is the maximally mixed state for a qubit, which represents equal probability of the qubit being in the states \\(|0\\rangle\\) or \\(|1\\rangle\\). In the Bloch sphere representation, which is a geometrical way to visualize qubit states, pure states lie on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states lie inside it. The maximally mixed state corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which is represented by the Bloch vector \\((0, 0, 0)\\).\n\nTo confirm this, the Bloch vector components are calculated as follows:\n\n1. \\(r_x = \\frac{\\rho_{01} + \\rho_{10}}{2}\\): Since \\(\\rho_{01} = 0\\) and \\(\\rho_{10} = 0\\), \\(r_x = 0\\).\n2. \\(r_y = \\frac{\\rho_{01} - \\rho_{10}}{2i}\\): Again, \\(\\rho_{01} = 0\\) and \\(\\rho_{10} = 0\\), so \\(r_y = 0\\).\n3. \\(r_z = \\frac{\\rho_{00} - \\rho_{11}}{2}\\): Here, \\(\\rho_{00} = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\rho_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}\\), so \\(r_z = 0\\).\n\nThus, the Bloch vector is \\((0, 0, 0)\\), corresponding to the center of the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct choice is:\n\n**A) \\(r = (1, 1, 0)\\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.**  \n**B) \\(r = (0, 0, 1)\\): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state \\(|0\\rangle\\).**  \n**C) \\(r = (0, 0, 0)\\): Correct, as this is the center of the Bloch sphere, representing the maximally mixed state.**  \n**D) \\(r = (1, 1, 1)\\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to any valid qubit state.**\n\nAnswer: C",

Pure states lie on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside.\n\nSo for a density matrix, the corresponding Bloch vector r gives the position in this space.

Let me correct that. The Bloch vector is given by r = (2 * Re(\u03c1_{01}), 2 * Im(\u03c1_{01}), Tr(\u03c3_z \u03c1) ), or something like that. Alternatively, another approach: The density matrix can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form is \u03c1 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2, where \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector.\n\nSo let's write \u03c1 in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices.

Oh wait, wait, no, because each is multiplied by 1, and then we multiply by 1/2. So the sum is I/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, |0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in (2,2). So adding them gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal, so it's the identity matrix. So \u03c1 is (I)/2.\n\nSo \u03c1 = I/2.

Because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only solution is r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0.\n\nSo the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would mean the density matrix is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. But wait, the origin represents the completely mixed state, right?

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubit space.

The given density matrix is \u03c1 = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, that looks familiar. I think this might be a mixed state because it's a combination of different projectors.\n\nWait, what's the structure of a density matrix for a qubit? Oh right, a qubit's density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The general form for a pure state |\u03c8><\u03c8| would be something like [[a\u00b2, ab],[ab, b\u00b2]] if \u03c8 is a|0> + b|1>, with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1. But this \u03c1 doesn't look like that. Instead, it's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So each of those terms is a projector, and adding them gives something else.\n\nLet me compute what \u03c1 looks like. |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 at (2,2). So adding them gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on both diagonal elements. Then we multiply by 1/2, so the diagonal becomes 1/2 each. So \u03c1 is:\n\n[[1/2, 0],\n [0, 1/2]]\n\nThat's a diagonal matrix where both diagonal entries are 0.5. I think this is a maximally mixed state because it's equally likely to be in |0> or |1>, so the qubit has no information\u2014it's as uncertain as possible.\n\nNow, the question is about the geometrical position of this state in the qubit space. I remember that qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The Bloch sphere has a vector (r) representing the state, with r being a point inside or on the sphere.\n\nThe Bloch vector is related to the density matrix elements. Let me recall the formula. For a density matrix \u03c1 = [[\u03c1_11, \u03c1_12], [\u03c1_21, \u03c1_22]], the Bloch vector components (r_x, r_y, r_z) are calculated as:\n\nr_x = (\u03c1_12 + \u03c1_21)\nr_y = (\u03c1_12 - \u03c1_21)/(i)\nr_z = \u03c1_11 - \u03c1_22\n\nWait, let me make sure I get that right. Oh right, \u03c1_12 is the element in the first row, second column. So in our case, \u03c1 is diagonal, so \u03c1_12 and \u03c1_21 are both zero. \n\nSo for r_x: (0 + 0) = 0.\nr_y: (0 - 0)/i = 0.\nr_z: \u03c1_11 - \u03c1_22 = (1/2) - (1/2) = 0.\n\nSo the Bloch vector is (0, 0, 0). That means the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. But wait, the origin is the completely mixed state. That makes sense because our \u03c1 is the maximally mixed state, so it's in the center.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that should be the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubit space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinates.\n\nFirst, I remember that a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. The given density matrix is \u03c1 = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, that looks familiar. I think this might be a mixed state because it's a combination of different projectors.\n\nWait, what's the structure of a density matrix for a qubit? Oh right, a qubit's density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The general form for a pure state |\u03c8><\u03c8| would be something like [[a\u00b2, ab],[ab, b\u00b2]] if \u03c8 is a|0> + b|1>, with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1. But this \u03c1 doesn't look like that. Instead, it's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So each of those terms is a projector, and adding them gives something else.\n\nLet me compute what \u03c1 looks like. |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 at (2,2). So adding them gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on both diagonal elements. Then we multiply by 1/2, so the diagonal becomes 1/2 each. So \u03c1 is:\n\n[[1/2, 0],\n [0, 1/2]]\n\nThat's a diagonal matrix where both diagonal entries are 0.5. I think this is a maximally mixed state because it's equally likely to be in |0> or |1>, so the qubit has no information\u2014it's as uncertain as possible.\n\nNow, the question is about the geometrical position of this state in the qubit space. I remember that qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The Bloch sphere has a vector (r) representing the state, with r being a point inside or on the sphere.\n\nThe Bloch vector is related to the density matrix elements. Let me recall the formula. For a density matrix \u03c1 = [[\u03c1_11, \u03c1_12], [\u03c1_21, \u03c1_22]], the Bloch vector components (r_x, r_y, r_z) are calculated as:\n\nr_x = (\u03c1_12 + \u03c1_21)\nr_y = (\u03c1_12 - \u03c1_21)/(i)\nr_z = \u03c1_11 - \u03c1_22\n\nWait, let me make sure I get that right. Oh right, \u03c1_12 is the element in the first row, second column. So in our case, \u03c1 is diagonal, so \u03c1_12 and \u03c1_21 are both zero. \n\nSo for r_x: (0 + 0) = 0.\nr_y: (0 - 0)/i = 0.\nr_z: \u03c1_11 - \u03c1_22 = (1/2) - (1/2) = 0.\n\nSo the Bloch vector is (0, 0, 0). That means the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. But wait, the origin is the completely mixed state. That makes sense because our \u03c1 is the maximally mixed state, so it's in the center.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that should be the correct answer.\n\n\nThe given density matrix is \n\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| + \\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| \\right).\n\\]\n\nThis represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit, as it is an equal mixture of the states \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we calculate the Bloch vector associated with this density matrix. The Bloch vector components \\((r_x, r_y, r_z)\\) are related to the density matrix elements as follows:\n\n\\[\nr_x = \\rho_{12} + \\rho_{21}, \\quad r_y = \\frac{\\rho_{12} - \\rho_{21}}{i}, \\quad r_z = \\rho_{11} - \\rho_{22}.\n\\]\n\nFor the given \\(\\rho\\), the off-diagonal elements \\(\\rho_{12}\\) and \\(\\rho_{21}\\) are zero because the matrix is diagonal. The diagonal elements are \\(\\rho_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\rho_{22} = \\frac{1}{2}\\). Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\nr_x = 0 + 0 = 0, \\quad r_y = \\frac{0 - 0}{i} = 0, \\quad r_z = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 0.\n\\]\n\nThus, the Bloch vector is \\((0, 0, 0)\\), which corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere. This represents the completely mixed state, consistent with the given density matrix. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n**C) \\(r = (0, 0, 0)\\)**.\n\nAnswer: C",

Wait, I remember that density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. Pure states have a density matrix with trace 1 and all eigenvalues adding up to 1. Mixed states are when it's a statistical mixture.\n\nLet me compute what this \u03c1 looks like in matrix form. The |0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in (2,2). So adding them together, the matrix becomes [[1,0],[0,1]], right? Then we multiply by 1/2, so it becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Oh, so \u03c1 is a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal.\n\nWait, I think this is the maximally mixed state.

Let's write that in matrix form: [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Comparing to the general form from the Bloch vector:\n\nThe (1,1) element is (1 + z)/2. In our case, that's 0.5. So (1 + z)/2 = 0.5 \u2192 1 + z = 1 \u2192 z=0. Similarly, the (2,2) element is (1 - z)/2 = 0.5 \u2192 same result, z=0.\n\nThe off-diagonal elements are (x - iy)/2 and their conjugate. In our \u03c1, the off-diagonal elements are zero. So (x - iy)/2 = 0 \u2192 x = 0 and y = 0.\n\nSo the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). Wait, but wait. The origin of the Bloch sphere is the completely mixed state. Because when r is zero, \u03c1 is (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which is our case. So that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.\n\nLet me double-check. The maximally mixed state is at the center of the Bloch sphere.
