      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nWe have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. The question is asking what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.\n\nHmm, right. Radioactive decay is a Poisson process, I remember. The key thing is that the decay is independent of time, so the probability doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without decay. Oh wait, but wait\u2014this is a tricky point. The 32% is the probability of decaying within the first 100 minutes, so maybe I should model this using the decay constant.\n\nLet me think about the decay formula. The probability that a nucleus has not decayed after time t is given by P(t) = e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. The decay probability up to time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). \n\nWait, the problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the same as 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100) = 0.32. So I can solve for \u03bb.\n\nLet me compute that. Rearranging the equation: e^(-\u03bb * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -\u03bb * 100 = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68)\u2026 I think ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit lower. Maybe ln(0.68) is around -0.3857. So \u03bb \u2248 0.3857 / 100 \u2248 0.003857 per minute.\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. Because 0.68 is e^(-\u03bb*100), so taking ln of 0.68 is negative. So ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.3857. So \u03bb = (0.3857) / 100 = 0.003857 min^-1.\n\nNow, the question is about the next 150 minutes. Wait, but we've already passed 50 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, no\u2014the decay probability is calculated from the time we start monitoring. So after 50 minutes, the remaining time we're looking at is 150 minutes from that point, so total time is 200 minutes. But wait, no\u2014wait, the initial 100 minutes was the time frame for the 32% probability. But the question is about the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. So the time we're considering is 150 minutes, starting from the current time.\n\nWait, no, wait. The decay process is memoryless. So the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes doesn't depend on how long it's been already. Because the process is independent of time. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the probability for the next 150 minutes. Hmm, but wait, that can't be right because the decay is a Poisson process, so the probability is dependent on the time interval.\n\nWait, let me think again. The initial 100 minutes gave a 32% decay chance. So the decay constant \u03bb is determined by that. Now, the question is: given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what is the chance it decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between 50 and 200 minutes). Alternatively, the chance that it decays in the interval from 50 to 200 minutes.\n\nBut because the process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays within any 150-minute period, regardless of when you start. So the initial 50 minutes don't affect this probability. So we can model it as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo let's compute that. We have \u03bb = 0.003857 min^-1, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo 1 - e^(-0.003857 * 150) = 1 - e^(-0.57855).\n\nWhat's e^(-0.57855)? Let me approximate. e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me calculate 0.57855 - 0.5 = 0.07855. So the value is 0.5 + 0.07855 = 0.57855.\n\nWait, perhaps using a calculator would be better, but since I can't do that, I'll approximate. Let me think that 0.57855 is approximately 0.58. So e^-0.58 \u2248 ?\n\nWait, e^-0.5 \u2248 0.6065, e^-0.6 \u2248 0.5488. So for 0.58, it's 0.58 - 0.5 = 0.08 above 0.5. Let's see, the difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1, and the function e^-x decreases by about 0.6065 - 0.5488 \u2248 0.0577 over that interval. So per 0.01 increase in x, e^-x decreases by about 0.0577/10 = 0.00577. So for 0.08 above 0.5, that's 8 * 0.00577 \u2248 0.046. So e^-0.58 \u2248 0.6065 - 0.046 \u2248 0.5605.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5605 \u2248 0.4395, which is about 44%. So looking at the options, option A is 44%.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The initial setup said that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Let me double-check the \u03bb calculation.\n\nSo 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100) = 0.32 \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100. Wait, ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588). Let me calculate that. ln(1.470588) is approximately 0.38566, so \u03bb is 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo, for 150 minutes, \u03bb*t = 0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.5785. So e^(-0.5785) is approximately e^-0.5785. Let me think, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is 0.5488. 0.5785 is 0.0785 above 0.5. So how much does e^-x decrease over that?\n\nThe derivative of e^-x is -e^-x. At x=0.5, the slope is -e^-0.5 \u2248 -0.6065. So the approximate change for a small delta is delta * slope. So for delta x=0.0785, change is 0.0785 * (-0.6065) \u2248 -0.0476. So e^-0.5785 \u2248 e^-0.5 + (-0.0476) \u2248 0.6065 - 0.0476 \u2248 0.5589.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5589 = 0.4411, about 44.11%. So the closest option is 44%, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the decay is memoryless. So the probability that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*50). Then, given that, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays within 150 minutes starting from time zero, because the process is memoryless. Wait, no. Because the process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period starting from now. So it's (1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)).\n\nWhich brings us back to the same calculation. So the answer should be approximately 44%, which is option A.\n",

So \u03bb = (0.3857) / 100 = 0.003857 min^-1.\n\nNow, the question is about the next 150 minutes. Wait, but we've already passed 50 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, no\u2014the decay probability is calculated from the time we start monitoring.

Hmm, but wait, that can't be right because the decay is a Poisson process, so the probability is dependent on the time interval.\n\nWait, let me think again.

We have \u03bb = 0.003857 min^-1, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo 1 - e^(-0.003857 * 150) = 1 - e^(-0.57855).\n\nWhat's e^(-0.57855)? Let me approximate. e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me calculate 0.57855 - 0.5 = 0.07855. So the value is 0.5 + 0.07855 = 0.57855.\n\nWait, perhaps using a calculator would be better, but since I can't do that, I'll approximate. Let me think that 0.57855 is approximately 0.58. So e^-0.58 \u2248 ?\n\nWait, e^-0.5 \u2248 0.6065, e^-0.6 \u2248 0.5488. So for 0.58, it's 0.58 - 0.5 = 0.08 above 0.5. Let's see, the difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1, and the function e^-x decreases by about 0.6065 - 0.5488 \u2248 0.0577 over that interval. So per 0.01 increase in x, e^-x decreases by about 0.0577/10 = 0.00577. So for 0.08 above 0.5, that's 8 * 0.00577 \u2248 0.046. So e^-0.58 \u2248 0.6065 - 0.046 \u2248 0.5605.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5605 \u2248 0.4395, which is about 44%. So looking at the options, option A is 44%.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The initial setup said that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Let me double-check the \u03bb calculation.\n\nSo 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100) = 0.32 \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100. Wait, ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588). Let me calculate that. ln(1.470588) is approximately 0.38566, so \u03bb is 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo, for 150 minutes, \u03bb*t = 0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.5785. So e^(-0.5785) is approximately e^-0.5785. Let me think, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is 0.5488. 0.5785 is 0.0785 above 0.5. So how much does e^-x decrease over that?\n\nThe derivative of e^-x is -e^-x. At x=0.5, the slope is -e^-0.5 \u2248 -0.6065. So the approximate change for a small delta is delta * slope. So for delta x=0.0785, change is 0.0785 * (-0.6065) \u2248 -0.0476. So e^-0.5785 \u2248 e^-0.5 + (-0.0476) \u2248 0.6065 - 0.0476 \u2248 0.5589.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5589 = 0.4411, about 44.11%. So the closest option is 44%, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the decay is memoryless. So the probability that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*50). Then, given that, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays within 150 minutes starting from time zero, because the process is memoryless. Wait, no. Because the process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period starting from now. So it's (1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)).\n\nWhich brings us back to the same calculation. So the answer should be approximately 44%, which is option A.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, we use the principles of radioactive decay, which follows a Poisson process.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, the question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. I need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. So, they've given me the probability for 100 minutes, but now I'm looking at a longer time frame, 150 minutes. But wait, no, not exactly. Let me read again.\n\nWait, actually, the 32% is the probability within 100 minutes. So, the decay probability P is 0.32 for t=100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, I think I need to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after the initial 50. Or wait, is it the next 150 minutes from now? Because the initial 50 have already passed without decay.\n\nSo, the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the 150 minutes is the remaining time after the 50 minutes have passed. So, the time elapsed after the start is 50 minutes, and the remaining time we're considering is 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.\n\nBut wait, in radioactive decay, the decay follows an exponential law, right? The decay constant \u03bb is related to the half-life, and the probability of decay in a certain time is given by P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). Oh wait, but wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.\n\nThe decay probability within time t is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-\u03bbt). So, if after 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32% (0.32), then the survival probability after 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Alternatively, the survival probability S(t) = e^(-\u03bbt) = 0.68 for t=100.\n\nSo, I can find \u03bb. Let me calculate \u03bb first. So, ln(S(t)) = -\u03bb t \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(S(t)) / t.\n\nSo, S(100) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, let me compute ln(0.68). I know ln(1)=0, ln(0.5)\u2248-0.693, ln(0.7)\u2248-0.3567, ln(0.68) would be a bit lower than that. Let me approximate it. Alternatively, I can calculate it.\n\nWait, ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) \u2248 -0.32 - (0.32)^2/2 - ... but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute it numerically. Let me think: 0.68 is e^x. Let me compute ln(0.68). \n\nUsing a calculator: ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.385662. So, \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability of decay after an additional 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Wait, no, actually, 50 minutes have passed, and we're looking for the next 150 minutes. So the total time considered is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. So the decay probability is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 200).\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the decay is conditional. Since 50 minutes have passed without decay, the remaining time is 150 minutes, so the new time to consider is 150 minutes. But wait, no, because the decay process is memoryless. The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes from the start. Because the exponential distribution has no memory.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from time zero. Because the memoryless property says that the past doesn't affect the future. So, the probability is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nWait, but wait, the 32% is given for 100 minutes. So I can find \u03bb using the given data. Then, calculate P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150). Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the probability of decay in 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes.\n\nWait, no, because the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for t minutes, is the same as the probability of decay in T minutes from the start.\n\nSo, given that, the probability we're looking for is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nWe have \u03bb \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nSo, \u03bb *150 \u2248 0.00385662 * 150 \u2248 0.578493.\n\ne^(-0.578493) \u2248 0.5617.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.5617 \u2248 0.4383, which is approximately 43.83%. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 44%, which would be close.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the steps.\n\nWait, another approach: the probability that the atom decays within 100 minutes is 0.32. So, the survival probability after 100 minutes is 0.68. The decay constant \u03bb is ln(2)/t_1/2. Wait, but the half-life is related to \u03bb by t_1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb. Alternatively, we can relate \u03bb to the survival probability.\n\nSo, S(t) = e^(-\u03bb t) = 0.68 at t=100.\n\nSo, \u03bb = ln(1/0.68)/100 = ln(1.470588)/100 \u2248 0.385662/100 = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, the probability of decay in 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) = 1 - e^(-0.00385662 *150).\n\nCompute 0.00385662 * 150: 0.00385662 * 150 = 0.578493.\n\ne^(-0.578493) \u2248 0.5617. So, 1 - 0.5617 = 0.4383, which is about 43.83%, so 44% is option A.\n\nBut wait, the question says that after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So, the survival probability after 50 minutes is S(50) = e^(-\u03bb *50). Then, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes would be the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes, which is S(50) - S(200).\n\nWait, that's another approach. Because the survival probability at 200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *200), and at 50 minutes it's e^(-\u03bb *50). So, the decay probability between 50 and 200 minutes is S(50) - S(200) = e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nWe have \u03bb \u2248 0.00385662.\n\nCompute e^(-\u03bb *50) = e^(-0.00385662 *50) = e^(-0.192831) \u2248 0.8253.\n\ne^(-\u03bb *200) = e^(-0.00385662 *200) = e^(-0.771324) \u2248 0.4615.\n\nSo, S(50) - S(200) = 0.8253 - 0.4615 \u2248 0.3638, which is 36.38%. But that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, but why is there a discrepancy? Because the two approaches are different.\n\nIn the first approach, using the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability in 150 minutes from the start, which was 43.83%. But in the second approach, calculating the decay between 50 and 200 minutes, we get 36.38%.\n\nSo which approach is correct?\n\nWait, the question says, \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.\" So, the time frame is 150 minutes starting from now, which is after 50 minutes. So, the correct approach is the second one: the decay probability between t=50 and t=200, which is S(50) - S(200).\n\nWait, but that's contradictory. Because the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next T minutes is the same as the initial probability for T minutes, regardless of how much time has already passed.\n\nSo, if the decay process is memoryless, then the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes should be the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period, which is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) = ~43.83%.\n\nBut according to the second approach, where you compute the probability between 50 and 200, it's 36.38%.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question states that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, we're to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Which would be the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.\n\nBut wait, the exponential distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of decay in the next T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed up to now, is the same as the probability of decay in the first T minutes. So, the two approaches should give the same result.\n\nWait, let me think again. The memoryless property states that P(T > t + s | T > t) = P(T > s), where T is the time of decay. So, the probability that the decay happens after t + s, given that it hasn't happened by t, is the same as the probability that it happens after s.\n\nWait, so in this case, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between t=50 and t=200) is equal to the probability that it decays in the first 150 minutes (t=0 to t=150). Because the memoryless property says that the past (50 minutes) doesn't affect the future.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the decay probability in 150 minutes from t=0 is 43.83%, but the decay probability between t=50 and t=200 would be S(50) - S(200) = e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200) \u2248 0.8253 - 0.4615 \u2248 0.3638, which is 36.38%.\n\nWait, but according to the memoryless property, P(decay between t=50 and t=200) = P(decay between t=0 and t=150) = 43.83%. So, I'm getting conflicting results. Which is correct?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach. Let me re-examine the math.\n\nThe probability that the decay occurs between t=50 and t=200 is P(50 < T \u2264 200) = S(50) - S(200) = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nBut according to the memoryless property, the conditional probability P(T \u2264 50 + 150 | T >50) = P(T \u2264150). So, the conditional probability is equal to the initial probability. So, P(decay in next 150 min) = P(decay in 150 min) = 43.83%, which would be option A.\n\nWait, but in that case, the second approach where I compute S(50) - S(200) must be wrong. Because according to the memoryless property, the conditional probability should be the same as the initial probability. So why is the S(50) - S(200) giving a different value?\n\nAh, because S(50) - S(200) is the probability that the decay occurs between 50 and 200, which is exactly what we're looking for, but according to the memoryless property, that should equal the probability of decay in the first 150 minutes, which is 43.83%.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculating S(50) and S(200).\n\nWait, let's compute them again.\n\n\u03bb = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nCompute S(50) = e^(-0.00385662 *50) = e^(-0.192831) \u2248 0.8253.\n\nCompute S(200) = e^(-0.00385662 *200) = e^(-0.771324) \u2248 0.4615.\n\nSo, S(50) - S(200) = 0.8253 - 0.4615 \u2248 0.3638, which is about 36.38%.\n\nBut according to the memoryless property, the probability should be 43.83%, not 36.38%. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I think I messed up the approach. Let's think again.\n\nThe memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t), regardless of how much time has already passed. So, in this case, t is 150 minutes. So, the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) = 43.83%.\n\nBut when I compute S(50) - S(200), I get 36.38%, which is different. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the time frames. Let me clarify.\n\nThe initial probability given is P(100) = 0.32. So, S(100) = 0.68.\n\nWe can compute \u03bb from this: \u03bb = ln(1/0.68)/100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is: after 50 minutes, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.\n\nOption 1: Using memoryless property, the probability is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) \u2248 43.83% \u2192 option A.\n\nOption 2: Compute S(50) - S(200) = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200) \u2248 0.8253 - 0.4615 \u2248 0.3638 \u2192 36.38%, which isn't an option.\n\nBut the options don't include 36%, so perhaps the correct approach is the first one, giving 44% as option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased in a way that it's the probability that the atom decays within 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 100 minutes. Wait, no, the question says that 50 minutes have passed, not 100.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to use the conditional probability. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe probability that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to the probability that it decays before t=200 minus the probability that it decays before t=50.\n\nWhich is P( T \u2264 200 ) - P( T \u226450 ) = [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nWhich is what I did earlier, and that gives 36.38%, which isn't an option. So, I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the \u03bb.\n\nLet me recompute \u03bb.\n\nGiven that S(100) = 0.68 \u2192 e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.68 \u2192 ln(0.68) = -\u03bb *100 \u2192 \u03bb = (-ln(0.68))/100.\n\nln(0.68) \u2248 -0.385662 \u2192 \u03bb \u2248 0.385662 / 100 = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nNow, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between t=50 and t=200) is:\n\nP = S(50) - S(200) = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200) = e^(-0.00385662 *50) - e^(-0.00385662 *200).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n- \u03bb *50 = 0.00385662 *50 = 0.192831 \u2192 e^-0.192831 \u2248 0.8253.\n\n- \u03bb *200 = 0.771324 \u2192 e^-0.771324 \u2248 0.4615.\n\nSo, 0.8253 - 0.4615 = 0.3638, which is 36.38%.\n\nBut none of the options match this. So, perhaps the correct approach is the memoryless one, and the 36.38% is wrong.\n\nWait, but that would imply that the correct answer is 44%, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe question states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, P(100) = 0.32. So, the survival probability S(100) = 0.68.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to compute the conditional probability.\n\nThe conditional probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between t=50 and t=200) is equal to the probability that it decays between 50 and 200, given that it hasn't decayed before 50.\n\nWhich is [P(50 < T \u2264 200)] / [P(T >50)].\n\nP(50 < T \u2264200) = S(50) - S(200) = 0.3638.\n\nP(T >50) = S(50) = 0.8253.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is 0.3638 / 0.8253 \u2248 0.441, which is approximately 44.1%, which is close to 44% (option A).\n\nAh! So, the correct approach is to calculate the conditional probability, which is the probability between 50 and 200 divided by the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50.\n\nSo, the calculation is (0.3638) / (0.8253) \u2248 0.441 \u2192 44.1%, which rounds to 44%, option A.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, the question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. I need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. So, they've given me the probability for 100 minutes, but now I'm looking at a longer time frame, 150 minutes. But wait, no, not exactly. Let me read again.\n\nWait, actually, the 32% is the probability within 100 minutes. So, the decay probability P is 0.32 for t=100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, I think I need to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after the initial 50. Or wait, is it the next 150 minutes from now? Because the initial 50 have already passed without decay.\n\nSo, the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the 150 minutes is the remaining time after the 50 minutes have passed. So, the time elapsed after the start is 50 minutes, and the remaining time we're considering is 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.\n\nBut wait, in radioactive decay, the decay follows an exponential law, right? The decay constant \u03bb is related to the half-life, and the probability of decay in a certain time is given by P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). Oh wait, but wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.\n\nThe decay probability within time t is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-\u03bbt). So, if after 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32% (0.32), then the survival probability after 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Alternatively, the survival probability S(t) = e^(-\u03bbt) = 0.68 for t=100.\n\nSo, I can find \u03bb. Let me calculate \u03bb first. So, ln(S(t)) = -\u03bb t \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(S(t)) / t.\n\nSo, S(100) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, let me compute ln(0.68). I know ln(1)=0, ln(0.5)\u2248-0.693, ln(0.7)\u2248-0.3567, ln(0.68) would be a bit lower than that. Let me approximate it. Alternatively, I can calculate it.\n\nWait, ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) \u2248 -0.32 - (0.32)^2/2 - ... but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute it numerically. Let me think: 0.68 is e^x. Let me compute ln(0.68). \n\nUsing a calculator: ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.385662. So, \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability of decay after an additional 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Wait, no, actually, 50 minutes have passed, and we're looking for the next 150 minutes. So the total time considered is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. So the decay probability is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 200).\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the decay is conditional. Since 50 minutes have passed without decay, the remaining time is 150 minutes, so the new time to consider is 150 minutes. But wait, no, because the decay process is memoryless. The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes from the start. Because the exponential distribution has no memory.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from time zero. Because the memoryless property says that the past doesn't affect the future. So, the probability is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nWait, but wait, the 32% is given for 100 minutes. So I can find \u03bb using the given data. Then, calculate P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150). Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the probability of decay in 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes.\n\nWait, no, because the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for t minutes, is the same as the probability of decay in T minutes from the start.\n\nSo, given that, the probability we're looking for is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nWe have \u03bb \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nSo, \u03bb *150 \u2248 0.00385662 * 150 \u2248 0.578493.\n\ne^(-0.578493) \u2248 0.5617.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.5617 \u2248 0.4383, which is approximately 43.83%. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 44%, which would be close.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the steps.\n\nWait, another approach: the probability that the atom decays within 100 minutes is 0.32. So, the survival probability after 100 minutes is 0.68. The decay constant \u03bb is ln(2)/t_1/2. Wait, but the half-life is related to \u03bb by t_1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb. Alternatively, we can relate \u03bb to the survival probability.\n\nSo, S(t) = e^(-\u03bb t) = 0.68 at t=100.\n\nSo, \u03bb = ln(1/0.68)/100 = ln(1.470588)/100 \u2248 0.385662/100 = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, the probability of decay in 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) = 1 - e^(-0.00385662 *150).\n\nCompute 0.00385662 * 150: 0.00385662 * 150 = 0.578493.\n\ne^(-0.578493) \u2248 0.5617. So, 1 - 0.5617 = 0.4383, which is about 43.83%, so 44% is option A.\n\nBut wait, the question says that after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So, the survival probability after 50 minutes is S(50) = e^(-\u03bb *50). Then, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes would be the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes, which is S(50) - S(200).\n\nWait, that's another approach. Because the survival probability at 200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *200), and at 50 minutes it's e^(-\u03bb *50). So, the decay probability between 50 and 200 minutes is S(50) - S(200) = e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nWe have \u03bb \u2248 0.00385662.\n\nCompute e^(-\u03bb *50) = e^(-0.00385662 *50) = e^(-0.192831) \u2248 0.8253.\n\ne^(-\u03bb *200) = e^(-0.00385662 *200) = e^(-0.771324) \u2248 0.4615.\n\nSo, S(50) - S(200) = 0.8253 - 0.4615 \u2248 0.3638, which is 36.38%. But that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, but why is there a discrepancy? Because the two approaches are different.\n\nIn the first approach, using the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability in 150 minutes from the start, which was 43.83%. But in the second approach, calculating the decay between 50 and 200 minutes, we get 36.38%.\n\nSo which approach is correct?\n\nWait, the question says, \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.\" So, the time frame is 150 minutes starting from now, which is after 50 minutes. So, the correct approach is the second one: the decay probability between t=50 and t=200, which is S(50) - S(200).\n\nWait, but that's contradictory. Because the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next T minutes is the same as the initial probability for T minutes, regardless of how much time has already passed.\n\nSo, if the decay process is memoryless, then the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes should be the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period, which is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) = ~43.83%.\n\nBut according to the second approach, where you compute the probability between 50 and 200, it's 36.38%.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question states that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, we're to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Which would be the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.\n\nBut wait, the exponential distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of decay in the next T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed up to now, is the same as the probability of decay in the first T minutes. So, the two approaches should give the same result.\n\nWait, let me think again. The memoryless property states that P(T > t + s | T > t) = P(T > s), where T is the time of decay. So, the probability that the decay happens after t + s, given that it hasn't happened by t, is the same as the probability that it happens after s.\n\nWait, so in this case, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between t=50 and t=200) is equal to the probability that it decays in the first 150 minutes (t=0 to t=150). Because the memoryless property says that the past (50 minutes) doesn't affect the future.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the decay probability in 150 minutes from t=0 is 43.83%, but the decay probability between t=50 and t=200 would be S(50) - S(200) = e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200) \u2248 0.8253 - 0.4615 \u2248 0.3638, which is 36.38%.\n\nWait, but according to the memoryless property, P(decay between t=50 and t=200) = P(decay between t=0 and t=150) = 43.83%. So, I'm getting conflicting results. Which is correct?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach. Let me re-examine the math.\n\nThe probability that the decay occurs between t=50 and t=200 is P(50 < T \u2264 200) = S(50) - S(200) = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nBut according to the memoryless property, the conditional probability P(T \u2264 50 + 150 | T >50) = P(T \u2264150). So, the conditional probability is equal to the initial probability. So, P(decay in next 150 min) = P(decay in 150 min) = 43.83%, which would be option A.\n\nWait, but in that case, the second approach where I compute S(50) - S(200) must be wrong. Because according to the memoryless property, the conditional probability should be the same as the initial probability. So why is the S(50) - S(200) giving a different value?\n\nAh, because S(50) - S(200) is the probability that the decay occurs between 50 and 200, which is exactly what we're looking for, but according to the memoryless property, that should equal the probability of decay in the first 150 minutes, which is 43.83%.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculating S(50) and S(200).\n\nWait, let's compute them again.\n\n\u03bb = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nCompute S(50) = e^(-0.00385662 *50) = e^(-0.192831) \u2248 0.8253.\n\nCompute S(200) = e^(-0.00385662 *200) = e^(-0.771324) \u2248 0.4615.\n\nSo, S(50) - S(200) = 0.8253 - 0.4615 \u2248 0.3638, which is about 36.38%.\n\nBut according to the memoryless property, the probability should be 43.83%, not 36.38%. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I think I messed up the approach. Let's think again.\n\nThe memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t), regardless of how much time has already passed. So, in this case, t is 150 minutes. So, the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) = 43.83%.\n\nBut when I compute S(50) - S(200), I get 36.38%, which is different. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the time frames. Let me clarify.\n\nThe initial probability given is P(100) = 0.32. So, S(100) = 0.68.\n\nWe can compute \u03bb from this: \u03bb = ln(1/0.68)/100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is: after 50 minutes, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.\n\nOption 1: Using memoryless property, the probability is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) \u2248 43.83% \u2192 option A.\n\nOption 2: Compute S(50) - S(200) = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200) \u2248 0.8253 - 0.4615 \u2248 0.3638 \u2192 36.38%, which isn't an option.\n\nBut the options don't include 36%, so perhaps the correct approach is the first one, giving 44% as option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased in a way that it's the probability that the atom decays within 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 100 minutes. Wait, no, the question says that 50 minutes have passed, not 100.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to use the conditional probability. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe probability that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to the probability that it decays before t=200 minus the probability that it decays before t=50.\n\nWhich is P( T \u2264 200 ) - P( T \u226450 ) = [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nWhich is what I did earlier, and that gives 36.38%, which isn't an option. So, I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the \u03bb.\n\nLet me recompute \u03bb.\n\nGiven that S(100) = 0.68 \u2192 e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.68 \u2192 ln(0.68) = -\u03bb *100 \u2192 \u03bb = (-ln(0.68))/100.\n\nln(0.68) \u2248 -0.385662 \u2192 \u03bb \u2248 0.385662 / 100 = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nNow, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between t=50 and t=200) is:\n\nP = S(50) - S(200) = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200) = e^(-0.00385662 *50) - e^(-0.00385662 *200).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n- \u03bb *50 = 0.00385662 *50 = 0.192831 \u2192 e^-0.192831 \u2248 0.8253.\n\n- \u03bb *200 = 0.771324 \u2192 e^-0.771324 \u2248 0.4615.\n\nSo, 0.8253 - 0.4615 = 0.3638, which is 36.38%.\n\nBut none of the options match this. So, perhaps the correct approach is the memoryless one, and the 36.38% is wrong.\n\nWait, but that would imply that the correct answer is 44%, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe question states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, P(100) = 0.32. So, the survival probability S(100) = 0.68.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to compute the conditional probability.\n\nThe conditional probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between t=50 and t=200) is equal to the probability that it decays between 50 and 200, given that it hasn't decayed before 50.\n\nWhich is [P(50 < T \u2264 200)] / [P(T >50)].\n\nP(50 < T \u2264200) = S(50) - S(200) = 0.3638.\n\nP(T >50) = S(50) = 0.8253.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is 0.3638 / 0.8253 \u2248 0.441, which is approximately 44.1%, which is close to 44% (option A).\n\nAh! So, the correct approach is to calculate the conditional probability, which is the probability between 50 and 200 divided by the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50.\n\nSo, the calculation is (0.3638) / (0.8253) \u2248 0.441 \u2192 44.1%, which rounds to 44%, option A.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the memoryless property of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. The decay probability within a given time \\( t \\) is \\( P(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t} \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant. The survival probability is \\( S(t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \\( \\lambda \\)\nFrom the given data, the probability of decay within 100 minutes is \\( P(100) = 0.32 \\). The survival probability after 100 minutes is:\n\\[\nS(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\\]\nUsing the survival probability formula \\( S(t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\), we solve for \\( \\lambda \\):\n\\[\n\\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(S(100))}{100} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100}\n\\]\nApproximating \\( \\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.385662 \\), we find:\n\\[\n\\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.385662}{100} \\approx 0.00385662 \\, \\text{per minute.}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Using the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval. This is given by:\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( \\lambda \\approx 0.00385662 \\) and \\( t = 150 \\):\n\\[\n\\lambda \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.00385662 \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.578493\n\\]\n\\[\ne^{-0.578493} \\approx 0.5617\n\\]\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - 0.5617 \\approx 0.4383 \\, \\text{(or 43.83%).}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Adjust for the conditional probability\nThe probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed, is the conditional probability:\n\\[\nP(\\text{decay in next 150 minutes} \\, | \\, \\text{no decay in 50 minutes}) = \\frac{P(50 < T \\leq 200)}{P(T > 50)}\n\\]\nHere, \\( P(50 < T \\leq 200) = S(50) - S(200) \\), and \\( P(T > 50) = S(50) \\). First, calculate \\( S(50) \\) and \\( S(200) \\):\n\\[\nS(50) = e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 50} = e^{-0.00385662 \\cdot 50} \\approx e^{-0.192831} \\approx 0.8253\n\\]\n\\[\nS(200) = e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 200} = e^{-0.00385662 \\cdot 200} \\approx e^{-0.771324} \\approx 0.4615\n\\]\n\\[\nP(50 < T \\leq 200) = S(50) - S(200) = 0.8253 - 0.4615 \\approx 0.3638\n\\]\n\\[\nP(T > 50) = S(50) \\approx 0.8253\n\\]\n\\[\nP(\\text{decay in next 150 minutes} \\, | \\, \\text{no decay in 50 minutes}) = \\frac{0.3638}{0.8253} \\approx 0.441 \\, \\text{(or 44.1%).}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay, is approximately **44%**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. Let me think. The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. But wait, it's about a single atom, not a large number of atoms. Oh right, for a single atom, the probability of decay relates to the concept of half-life, but wait, maybe it's more about the decay constant.\n\nWait, so the decay probability over a certain time is given. So I think the formula is N = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), but since we're dealing with probabilities, maybe the probability of decay is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). Because that gives the chance that the atom has decayed by time t.\n\nSo the given is that in 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32%, which is 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100). Let me solve for \u03bb.\n\nWait, wait, that's 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100). So rearranging, e^(-\u03bb *100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural log on both sides: -\u03bb *100 = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nLet me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.5) is about -0.693, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108, ln(0.68) is around... Let me think, 0.68 is between 0.6 and 0.7. So ln(0.68) is about -0.38566. Wait, I can calculate it more accurately: ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the situation is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So we're looking for the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait, no. Because 50 minutes have passed, so the remaining time is 150 minutes from now, but the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Alternatively, since the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, we can think of the problem as a conditional probability.\n\nWait, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. Oh, right, because the question says that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. So it's a conditional probability.\n\nSo the formula for conditional probability here is P(decay in next 150 | not decayed in first 50).\n\nWhich is [P(decay in next 150 and not decay before 50)] / P(not decay before 50).\n\nBut since decay is a Poisson process, the probability of decay in a given time is independent of previous times. So the conditional probability simplifies to P(decay in 150 min) / P(not decay in 50 min).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The decay is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for t minutes, is the same as the probability of decaying in T minutes starting from time zero.\n\nWait, no. The probability that it decays in the next T minutes after time t is the same as the probability it decays in T minutes starting from zero, because of the memoryless property. So the conditional probability is just the same as the probability of decaying in T minutes, regardless of the previous time. Hmm, wait, no. Let me think.\n\nThe probability that it decays between time t and t + T is equal to the probability that it decays in T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed before time t. Because the process is memoryless, this is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in T minutes. So yes, it's just the same as the probability of decaying in T minutes, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bbT).\n\nWait, but let me verify. The probability that it decays after time t is e^(-\u03bbt), right? Because the survival probability is e^(-\u03bbt). So the probability that it decays between t and t+T is e^(-\u03bbt) * (1 - e^(-\u03bbT)).\n\nWait, no, wait. The probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-\u03bbt). The probability that it decays between t and t+T is the probability that it hasn't decayed by t multiplied by the probability that it decays in the next T minutes, given it hasn't decayed yet. But since the process is memoryless, that second probability is the same as the probability of decaying in T minutes from time zero.\n\nSo the probability is e^(-\u03bbt) * (1 - e^(-\u03bbT)).\n\nWait, no, wait. That would be correct if the decay in the next T is a separate event. But actually, the probability that the decay occurs between t and t+T is P(t < decay time < t+T). Which is equal to the survival probability up to t multiplied by the probability of decaying in the next T. So that would be e^(-\u03bbt) * [1 - e^(-\u03bbT)].\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because the probability of decaying in the next T after t is [1 - e^(-\u03bbT)] multiplied by e^(-\u03bbt), but wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the cumulative distribution function for decay time is F(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So the probability that the decay time is less than t + T, given that it is greater than t, is [F(t+T) - F(t)] / (1 - F(t)).\n\nWait, no, because F(t) is the probability that the decay time is less than or equal to t. So the probability that it's in (t, t+T) is F(t+T) - F(t). And the conditional probability is [F(t+T) - F(t)] / [1 - F(t)].\n\nWhich simplifies to [1 - e^(-\u03bb(t+T)) - (1 - e^(-\u03bbt))] / [e^(-\u03bbt)].\n\nThat's [e^(-\u03bbt) - e^(-\u03bb(t+T)))] / e^(-\u03bbt) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbT).\n\nSo the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bbT). So the same as the probability of decaying in T minutes starting from time zero.\n\nSo in this problem, the time T is 150 minutes, because the next 150 minutes are the time to consider after 50 minutes have passed. So the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me get back to the problem. The question says, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So the probability we need is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, which is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes from now. So that is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nBut wait, earlier, we found \u03bb from the given 32% decay in 100 minutes. So let's compute that.\n\nSo from the first part, we found \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo for 150 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 150). Let me compute that exponent.\n\n0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.57849.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) is approximately. Let me calculate: e^-0.5785.\n\nI know that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nLet me compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me use the Taylor expansion or a calculator-like approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute ln(0.5785) but wait, I'm just trying to find e^-0.5785.\n\nWait, let me think. e^0.5785 is approximately. Let's see: e^0.5 is 1.64872, e^0.57 is about 1.768. e^0.5785 \u2248 let's see, 0.5785 is 0.5 + 0.0785.\n\nSo e^0.5785 = e^0.5 * e^0.0785.\n\ne^0.0785 \u2248 1 + 0.0785 + (0.0785)^2/2 + (0.0785)^3/6.\n\n0.0785^2 is about 0.00616, divided by 2 is 0.00308. 0.0785^3 is about 0.000483, divided by 6 is ~0.0000805.\n\nSo adding up: 1 + 0.0785 = 1.0785 + 0.00308 = 1.08158 + 0.0000805 \u2248 1.08166.\n\nSo e^0.5785 \u2248 e^0.5 * 1.08166 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08166 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n1.64872 * 1.08 = approx 1.64872 *1 = 1.64872, 1.64872 * 0.08 = ~0.1319. So 1.64872 + 0.1319 \u2248 1.7806.\n\nBut wait, more accurately, 1.64872 * 1.08166 = ?\n\nLet me compute 1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.64872 * (1 + 0.08) = 1.64872 + (1.64872 * 0.08).\n\n1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976. So 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176.\n\nThen, 1.64872 * 0.00166 \u2248 approx 0.00273.\n\nSo total is approx 1.7806176 + 0.00273 \u2248 1.78335.\n\nSo e^0.5785 \u2248 1.78335. Therefore, e^-0.5785 \u2248 1/1.78335 \u2248 0.56.\n\nSo 1 - e^-0.5785 \u2248 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, which is 44%.\n\nWait, but that's the probability for 150 minutes, but wait, wait a minute. Wait, the 32% decay was in 100 minutes, but after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. Does that affect the calculation?\n\nWait, no, because the decay process is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes regardless of the previous time.\n\nWait, but wait, in the problem statement, the 32% decay is in 100 minutes. So that's the probability for 100 minutes. But the question is, after 50 minutes, what's the probability to decay in the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start is 200 minutes.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the decay is independent of the previous time. Because the given 32% is the decay probability in 100 minutes, which is for any atom. So perhaps the problem is that the decay is in 100 minutes, but when 50 have passed, we need to find the probability for the next 150.\n\nBut according to the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next T minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb T), regardless of how much time has passed before. So in this case, the 50 minutes have passed, so the next 150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo according to my earlier calculation, that's about 44%, which is option A.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations. Because 32% in 100 minutes gives me \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the 32% decay in 100 minutes is P(decay in 100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100). So e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.68. So \u03bb = - ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute ln(0.68) accurately.\n\nln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) \u2248 -0.385662. So \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nThen, for 150 minutes, \u03bb*150 = 0.00385662 *150 \u2248 0.578493.\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) \u2248 0.56, as before.\n\nSo 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, which is 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options: option A is 44%, option B is 40%, C is 52%, D is 48%.\n\nWait, but another approach: Maybe the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so the half-life can be found, and then use that to find the probability for 150 minutes.\n\nWait, let's try that approach. The decay probability P is 32% in 100 minutes. So P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt) = 0.32.\n\nSo \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nAlternatively, the half-life T_1/2 is given by T_1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb.\n\nSo \u03bb = ln(2)/T_1/2. Let's compute T_1/2.\n\nT_1/2 = ln(2)/ (0.0038566) \u2248 0.693147 / 0.0038566 \u2248 180 minutes.\n\nWait, so the half-life is 180 minutes.\n\nSo in 150 minutes, the decay probability would be 1 - (1/2)^(150/180) = 1 - (1/2)^(5/6).\n\nWhat's (1/2)^(5/6) approximately?\n\n5/6 is about 0.8333. So 2^0.8333 is approximately 2^(5/6) \u2248 e^( (5/6) * ln(2) ) \u2248 e^( (5/6)*0.6931 ) \u2248 e^0.5776 \u2248 1.78.\n\nSo 1/(2^0.8333) \u2248 1/1.78 \u2248 0.56.\n\nSo 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, same as before.\n\nSo the probability is 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but another thought: the question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. But the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next T minutes is the same regardless of the time that has passed. So the answer is 44%, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the probability of decay in 150 minutes from the start, but that would be a different calculation. Wait, no, the question says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed, so the next 150 minutes would be from 50 to 200 minutes. But because of the memoryless property, it's the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from now.\n\nSo yeah, I think the correct answer is 44%, option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. Let me think. The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. But wait, it's about a single atom, not a large number of atoms. Oh right, for a single atom, the probability of decay relates to the concept of half-life, but wait, maybe it's more about the decay constant.\n\nWait, so the decay probability over a certain time is given. So I think the formula is N = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), but since we're dealing with probabilities, maybe the probability of decay is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). Because that gives the chance that the atom has decayed by time t.\n\nSo the given is that in 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32%, which is 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100). Let me solve for \u03bb.\n\nWait, wait, that's 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100). So rearranging, e^(-\u03bb *100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural log on both sides: -\u03bb *100 = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nLet me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.5) is about -0.693, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108, ln(0.68) is around... Let me think, 0.68 is between 0.6 and 0.7. So ln(0.68) is about -0.38566. Wait, I can calculate it more accurately: ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the situation is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So we're looking for the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait, no. Because 50 minutes have passed, so the remaining time is 150 minutes from now, but the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Alternatively, since the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, we can think of the problem as a conditional probability.\n\nWait, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. Oh, right, because the question says that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. So it's a conditional probability.\n\nSo the formula for conditional probability here is P(decay in next 150 | not decayed in first 50).\n\nWhich is [P(decay in next 150 and not decay before 50)] / P(not decay before 50).\n\nBut since decay is a Poisson process, the probability of decay in a given time is independent of previous times. So the conditional probability simplifies to P(decay in 150 min) / P(not decay in 50 min).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The decay is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for t minutes, is the same as the probability of decaying in T minutes starting from time zero.\n\nWait, no. The probability that it decays in the next T minutes after time t is the same as the probability it decays in T minutes starting from zero, because of the memoryless property. So the conditional probability is just the same as the probability of decaying in T minutes, regardless of the previous time. Hmm, wait, no. Let me think.\n\nThe probability that it decays between time t and t + T is equal to the probability that it decays in T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed before time t. Because the process is memoryless, this is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in T minutes. So yes, it's just the same as the probability of decaying in T minutes, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bbT).\n\nWait, but let me verify. The probability that it decays after time t is e^(-\u03bbt), right? Because the survival probability is e^(-\u03bbt). So the probability that it decays between t and t+T is e^(-\u03bbt) * (1 - e^(-\u03bbT)).\n\nWait, no, wait. The probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-\u03bbt). The probability that it decays between t and t+T is the probability that it hasn't decayed by t multiplied by the probability that it decays in the next T minutes, given it hasn't decayed yet. But since the process is memoryless, that second probability is the same as the probability of decaying in T minutes from time zero.\n\nSo the probability is e^(-\u03bbt) * (1 - e^(-\u03bbT)).\n\nWait, no, wait. That would be correct if the decay in the next T is a separate event. But actually, the probability that the decay occurs between t and t+T is P(t < decay time < t+T). Which is equal to the survival probability up to t multiplied by the probability of decaying in the next T. So that would be e^(-\u03bbt) * [1 - e^(-\u03bbT)].\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because the probability of decaying in the next T after t is [1 - e^(-\u03bbT)] multiplied by e^(-\u03bbt), but wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the cumulative distribution function for decay time is F(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So the probability that the decay time is less than t + T, given that it is greater than t, is [F(t+T) - F(t)] / (1 - F(t)).\n\nWait, no, because F(t) is the probability that the decay time is less than or equal to t. So the probability that it's in (t, t+T) is F(t+T) - F(t). And the conditional probability is [F(t+T) - F(t)] / [1 - F(t)].\n\nWhich simplifies to [1 - e^(-\u03bb(t+T)) - (1 - e^(-\u03bbt))] / [e^(-\u03bbt)].\n\nThat's [e^(-\u03bbt) - e^(-\u03bb(t+T)))] / e^(-\u03bbt) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbT).\n\nSo the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bbT). So the same as the probability of decaying in T minutes starting from time zero.\n\nSo in this problem, the time T is 150 minutes, because the next 150 minutes are the time to consider after 50 minutes have passed. So the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me get back to the problem. The question says, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So the probability we need is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, which is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes from now. So that is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nBut wait, earlier, we found \u03bb from the given 32% decay in 100 minutes. So let's compute that.\n\nSo from the first part, we found \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo for 150 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 150). Let me compute that exponent.\n\n0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.57849.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) is approximately. Let me calculate: e^-0.5785.\n\nI know that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nLet me compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me use the Taylor expansion or a calculator-like approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute ln(0.5785) but wait, I'm just trying to find e^-0.5785.\n\nWait, let me think. e^0.5785 is approximately. Let's see: e^0.5 is 1.64872, e^0.57 is about 1.768. e^0.5785 \u2248 let's see, 0.5785 is 0.5 + 0.0785.\n\nSo e^0.5785 = e^0.5 * e^0.0785.\n\ne^0.0785 \u2248 1 + 0.0785 + (0.0785)^2/2 + (0.0785)^3/6.\n\n0.0785^2 is about 0.00616, divided by 2 is 0.00308. 0.0785^3 is about 0.000483, divided by 6 is ~0.0000805.\n\nSo adding up: 1 + 0.0785 = 1.0785 + 0.00308 = 1.08158 + 0.0000805 \u2248 1.08166.\n\nSo e^0.5785 \u2248 e^0.5 * 1.08166 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08166 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n1.64872 * 1.08 = approx 1.64872 *1 = 1.64872, 1.64872 * 0.08 = ~0.1319. So 1.64872 + 0.1319 \u2248 1.7806.\n\nBut wait, more accurately, 1.64872 * 1.08166 = ?\n\nLet me compute 1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.64872 * (1 + 0.08) = 1.64872 + (1.64872 * 0.08).\n\n1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976. So 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176.\n\nThen, 1.64872 * 0.00166 \u2248 approx 0.00273.\n\nSo total is approx 1.7806176 + 0.00273 \u2248 1.78335.\n\nSo e^0.5785 \u2248 1.78335. Therefore, e^-0.5785 \u2248 1/1.78335 \u2248 0.56.\n\nSo 1 - e^-0.5785 \u2248 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, which is 44%.\n\nWait, but that's the probability for 150 minutes, but wait, wait a minute. Wait, the 32% decay was in 100 minutes, but after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. Does that affect the calculation?\n\nWait, no, because the decay process is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes regardless of the previous time.\n\nWait, but wait, in the problem statement, the 32% decay is in 100 minutes. So that's the probability for 100 minutes. But the question is, after 50 minutes, what's the probability to decay in the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start is 200 minutes.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the decay is independent of the previous time. Because the given 32% is the decay probability in 100 minutes, which is for any atom. So perhaps the problem is that the decay is in 100 minutes, but when 50 have passed, we need to find the probability for the next 150.\n\nBut according to the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next T minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb T), regardless of how much time has passed before. So in this case, the 50 minutes have passed, so the next 150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo according to my earlier calculation, that's about 44%, which is option A.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations. Because 32% in 100 minutes gives me \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the 32% decay in 100 minutes is P(decay in 100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100). So e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.68. So \u03bb = - ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute ln(0.68) accurately.\n\nln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) \u2248 -0.385662. So \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nThen, for 150 minutes, \u03bb*150 = 0.00385662 *150 \u2248 0.578493.\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) \u2248 0.56, as before.\n\nSo 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, which is 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options: option A is 44%, option B is 40%, C is 52%, D is 48%.\n\nWait, but another approach: Maybe the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so the half-life can be found, and then use that to find the probability for 150 minutes.\n\nWait, let's try that approach. The decay probability P is 32% in 100 minutes. So P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt) = 0.32.\n\nSo \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nAlternatively, the half-life T_1/2 is given by T_1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb.\n\nSo \u03bb = ln(2)/T_1/2. Let's compute T_1/2.\n\nT_1/2 = ln(2)/ (0.0038566) \u2248 0.693147 / 0.0038566 \u2248 180 minutes.\n\nWait, so the half-life is 180 minutes.\n\nSo in 150 minutes, the decay probability would be 1 - (1/2)^(150/180) = 1 - (1/2)^(5/6).\n\nWhat's (1/2)^(5/6) approximately?\n\n5/6 is about 0.8333. So 2^0.8333 is approximately 2^(5/6) \u2248 e^( (5/6) * ln(2) ) \u2248 e^( (5/6)*0.6931 ) \u2248 e^0.5776 \u2248 1.78.\n\nSo 1/(2^0.8333) \u2248 1/1.78 \u2248 0.56.\n\nSo 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, same as before.\n\nSo the probability is 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but another thought: the question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. But the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next T minutes is the same regardless of the time that has passed.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe problem says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, the decay probability is 32% over 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait, no\u2014wait, the next 150 minutes? Or is it the remaining time?\n\nWait, the question says 50 minutes have passed, so the time left from the initial start would be 100 -50=50 minutes? Or wait, no\u2014because the original decay probability is given for 100 minutes. So the initial decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So how does this affect the remaining time?\n\nHmm. Radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? It follows an exponential decay law. The key thing is that the decay is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So, if the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability of it decaying in the next t minutes is the same as it decaying in any other t-minute period, regardless of previous history.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The decay probability is given as 32% over 100 minutes. So maybe the decay constant \u03bb is such that the probability of decay in time T is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb T) = 0.32. So, first, I can find \u03bb from that.\n\nWait, but that's the initial setup. Then, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So the probability it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *50). But since the process is memoryless, the remaining probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from the start, multiplied by the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, the remaining time is 50 minutes. Because the initial 100 minutes are up. Wait, the question says \"the next 150 minutes.\" Wait, that can't be. Because if 50 minutes have passed, and the next 150 would be from the current time. So that would be 50 +150=200 minutes from the start? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me parse the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So, the probability of decaying in the first 100 minutes is 32%. Then, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. We are to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So, the next 150 minutes after the current time (when 50 minutes have already passed) would make the total time 50+150=200 minutes. So the question is, what's the probability that the atom decays between t=50 to t=200 minutes.\n\nWait, but the initial probability given is for 100 minutes. So perhaps I can model this using the decay law.\n\nLet me recap. The decay probability in time T is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb T). So, for T=100 minutes, P=0.32.\n\nSo, 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.32 \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/(100). Let me compute ln(0.68): ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but wait, 0.68 is about e^-0.415? Let me calculate it more accurately.\n\nln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. So, \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo the decay constant is about 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nIn radioactive decay, the probability of decay in a given time interval is independent of the past. So, the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 (which is 150 minutes) is the same as the probability that it decays in any 150-minute interval starting at t=50.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014because the initial condition is that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the probability that it hasn't decayed by t=50 is e^(-\u03bb *50). Then, the probability it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the probability it decays in 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet.\n\nAlternatively, the conditional probability is P(50 < decay <200 | decay >50) = [P(50 < decay <200)] / P(decay>50).\n\nWait, but because of the memoryless property, this is equal to P(decay in 150 minutes starting now) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. Since the process is memoryless, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes from any starting point. So, regardless of whether it's the first 100 or 50 minutes, the probability for the next 150 is the same as the probability for any 150-minute period.\n\nBut wait, no, because the initial probability is given for a 100-minute period. So maybe the setup is that the decay is modeled as a Poisson process, and we can find the decay constant \u03bb from the given data, then compute the probability for 150 minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the decay as an exponential probability distribution. The probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is P(t) = e^(-\u03bb t).\n\nSo, the decay probability in the first 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. So, 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.32 \u2192 e^(-100 \u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = ln(1/0.68)/100 \u2248 0.38566/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, given that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, but wait! Because the 150 minutes after 50 minutes is 200 minutes total. So the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is the same as the probability of decay in the first 150 minutes, but starting at 50.\n\nWait, but because the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150). So let me calculate that.\n\nCompute \u03bb *150 = 0.0038566 *150 \u2248 0.5785.\n\nSo, e^(-0.5785) \u2248 0.561. So 1 - 0.561 \u2248 0.439, which is about 43.9%, which is approximately 44%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 44%.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Another approach: the probability that it decays after 50 minutes is P(>50) = e^(-\u03bb *50). Then, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is P(50 < decay <200) = P(decay <200) - P(decay <50) = [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] = e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nBut because the process is memoryless, the conditional probability is [e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200)] / e^(-\u03bb *50) )= 1 - e^(-\u03bb*(200-50)) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150), which is the same as the previous approach.\n\nSo either way, the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) \u2248 43.9% \u2192 44%, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.\n\nSo the answer would be A)44%?\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let me compute \u03bb again.\n\nGiven that P(decay in 100 minutes)=32% \u2192 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = (-ln(0.68))/100 \u2192 ln(0.68) is approximately -0.385662. So \u03bb \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, compute \u03bb *150 = 0.00385662 *150 \u2248 0.578493.\n\ne^(-0.578493) \u2248 let's compute that.\n\nWe know that e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488, e^(-0.578493) is between these. Let me compute 0.578493.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator approach:\n\nCompute ln(2) \u22480.6931, so 0.5785 is about 0.5785 = 0.6931 * (0.5785/0.6931) \u2248 0.6931 *0.835 \u2248 0.5785.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute e^-0.5785.\n\nLet me compute e^-0.5785:\n\nWe can use the Taylor series expansion around 0:\n\ne^x = 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24 + ...\n\nBut since x is negative, perhaps compute it as:\n\ne^-0.5785 \u2248 1 - 0.5785 + (0.5785)^2/2 - (0.5785)^3/6 + (0.5785)^4/24 - ...\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm 0: 1\n\nTerm 1: -0.5785 \u2192 0.4215\n\nTerm 2: (0.5785)^2 /2 \u2248 (0.3347)/2 \u2248 0.1674 \u2192 0.4215 +0.1674=0.5889\n\nTerm3: -(0.5785)^3/6 \u2192 (0.5785^3)= approx 0.5785 *0.3347 \u22480.1939 \u2192 0.1939/6\u22480.0323 \u2192 subtract 0.0323 \u2192 0.5889 -0.0323=0.5566\n\nTerm4: (0.5785)^4 /24 \u2192 0.5785^4 is (0.5785^2)^2 = (0.3347)^2 \u22480.1120 \u2192 0.1120/24\u22480.00466 \u2192 add \u2192 0.5566 +0.00466=0.5613.\n\nTerm5: -(0.5785)^5 /120 \u2192 0.5785^5 = 0.5785 *0.1120\u22480.0647 \u2192 0.0647/120\u22480.000539 \u2192 subtract \u2192 0.5613 -0.000539\u22480.5607.\n\nSo e^-0.5785 \u22480.5607.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5607=0.4393 \u2192 approximately 43.93% which is about 44%, so option A is correct.\n\nWait, but another approach: the probability that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-50 \u03bb). Then, the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-150 \u03bb).\n\nBut wait, that's the same as before. So that gives 44%.\n\nAlternatively, some might think that because 50 minutes have passed, the remaining time is 50 minutes, but the question says \"next 150 minutes\", which is after the initial 50, so it's 150 minutes, not 50. So, that approach is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option A, 44%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe problem says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, the decay probability is 32% over 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait, no\u2014wait, the next 150 minutes? Or is it the remaining time?\n\nWait, the question says 50 minutes have passed, so the time left from the initial start would be 100 -50=50 minutes? Or wait, no\u2014because the original decay probability is given for 100 minutes. So the initial decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed.

From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \\( P = 0.32 \\). Using this, we can calculate \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\[\n0.32 = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100}\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\ne^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.68\n\\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\n-\\lambda \\cdot 100 = \\ln(0.68)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{-\\ln(0.68)}{100}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( \\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.38566 \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.38566}{100} \\approx 0.0038566 \\, \\text{per minute}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay probabilities, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows something called the exponential decay law. But wait, the question is about the probability of decay over a certain time, given that it hasn't decayed for a while already.\n\nThe problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance the atom has decayed. That means the probability of it not decaying in 100 minutes is 68% because 100% minus 32% is 68%. \n\nWait, right. The general formula for the probability of decay is P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant and t is time. Alternatively, the probability of not decaying is P_not(t) = e^(-\u03bbt). So, since after 100 minutes, the probability of not decaying is 68%, which is 0.68.\n\nSo, I can write that as e^(-\u03bb * 100) = 0.68. I need to solve for \u03bb here. Taking the natural logarithm on both sides, I get ln(0.68) = -\u03bb * 100. So, \u03bb is equal to -ln(0.68) divided by 100. Let me calculate that. \n\nWait, ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.3857. So, \u03bb = 0.3857 / 100 \u2248 0.003857 per minute. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check that. Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, I know that ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, and ln(0.7) is around -0.3567. So 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so ln(0.68) would be a bit less than -0.3567. Maybe around -0.3856? Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, \u03bb \u2248 0.003857 per minute.\n\nNow, the question says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, we're looking for the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait. Wait a second, that's a bit confusing. Because 50 minutes have passed, and we're now considering the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, no, the question is about the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes. Or is it the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes?\n\nWait, no, the question says: So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? So the next 150 minutes from the current time, which is 50 minutes after the start. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the way to compute the probability is to find the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next T minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes should only depend on \u03bb and T=150.\n\nWait, that's an important point. The memoryless property of exponential distributions. So the probability that the atom decays in the next T minutes is the same as the probability that it decays within T minutes starting from time zero. So the past 50 minutes don't affect this probability. So the answer should be based on the decay probability over 150 minutes, calculated using \u03bb.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial information was that in 100 minutes, the probability is 32%. So I think I should calculate the decay constant \u03bb based on that, then compute the probability for 150 minutes.\n\nSo, first, let me get \u03bb from the 100-minute data.\n\nWe have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). So, e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68. Taking ln of both sides: -\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68) / 100. Which is approximately 0.003857 per minute.\n\nNow, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Let's compute that.\n\nCompute \u03bb * 150: 0.003857 * 150 \u2248 0.57855.\n\nSo, e^(-0.57855) \u2248 e^-0.57855. What's e^-0.57855? Let me think. e^-0.5 is about 0.6065. e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's approximate. 0.57855 is 0.57855 - 0.5 = 0.07855 above 0.5. So the e^-0.57855 is between 0.6065 and 0.5488. Let's see, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator.\n\nWait, let me calculate it more accurately. Let me use a calculator-like approach. Let's compute 0.57855.\n\ne^x for x = 0.57855:\n\nWe can use the Taylor series, but that might take too long. Alternatively, I can use known values. Alternatively, perhaps using natural logarithm tables, but I think it's easier to approximate.\n\nAlternatively, using logarithm tables or a calculator. Let's think: ln(2) is about 0.6931. So 0.57855 is approximately 0.6931 * 0.835. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute e^(-0.57855) \u2248 1/(e^0.57855). Let me compute e^0.57855.\n\nWe know that e^0.5 \u2248 1.6487, e^0.6 \u2248 1.8221, e^0.58 is approximately? Let me compute 0.57855 is 0.58 approximately.\n\nLet me compute e^0.58. Using the Taylor series around x=0.5:\n\ne^x = e^0.5 * e^0.08.\n\nWe know e^0.5 \u2248 1.64872.\n\ne^0.08 is approximately 1 + 0.08 + (0.08)^2/2 + (0.08)^3/6 + (0.08)^4/24.\n\nSo that's 1 + 0.08 = 1.08.\n\nPlus (0.0064)/2 = 0.0032 \u2192 1.0832.\n\nPlus (0.000512)/6 \u2248 0.000085 \u2192 1.083285.\n\nPlus (0.00004096)/24 \u2248 0.0000017 \u2192 approximately 1.0832867.\n\nSo e^0.08 \u2248 1.0832867.\n\nSo e^0.58 \u2248 e^0.5 * e^0.08 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.0832867 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute 1.64872 * 1.0832867.\n\n1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872.\n\n1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976.\n\n1.64872 * 0.0032867 \u2248 approx 0.0054.\n\nSo adding up: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.0054 \u2248 1.786.\n\nSo e^0.58 \u2248 1.786, so e^(-0.58) \u2248 1/1.786 \u2248 0.5586.\n\nWait, but 0.57855 is a bit higher than 0.58, so e^0.57855 is a bit less than e^0.58. So e^(-0.57855) is a bit higher than 0.5586.\n\nWait, but wait, 0.57855 is 0.57855 = 0.58 + 0.00145. So e^0.57855 = e^(0.58 - 0.00145) = e^0.58 * e^(-0.00145). \n\nWe have e^0.58 \u2248 1.786, e^-0.00145 \u2248 0.99855. So 1.786 * 0.99855 \u2248 1.786 - (1.786 * 0.00145) \u2192 1.786 - 0.00258 \u2248 1.7834.\n\nSo e^0.57855 \u2248 1.7834, so e^-0.57855 \u2248 1/1.7834 \u2248 0.5595.\n\nSo approximately 0.5595. So 1 - 0.5595 = 0.4405, which is about 44.05%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 44%, so that's close.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a more precise method to compute \u03bb.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's compute \u03bb again. We have e^(-\u03bb * 100) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100.\n\nln(0.68) is approximately -0.385662. So \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nCompute \u03bb*150 = 0.00385662 * 150 = 0.578493.\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) = ?\n\nLet me compute this more accurately. Let me use the fact that e^(-x) \u2248 1 - x + x\u00b2/2 - x\u00b3/6 + ... but that might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a calculator or known logarithms, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can use the fact that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.\n\nWait, 0.578493 is approximately 0.5785. Let me think about e^-0.5785.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for e^x for x = -0.5785.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute e^0.5785 first, then take reciprocal.\n\nSo e^0.5785.\n\nWe can use the Taylor expansion around x=0.5.\n\ne^x = e^0.5 * e^{x-0.5}.\n\nSo x is 0.5785, so x-0.5 = 0.0785.\n\ne^{0.0785} \u2248 1 + 0.0785 + (0.0785^2)/2 + (0.0785^3)/6.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n0.0785 squared is approximately 0.006162. Divided by 2 is 0.003081.\n\n0.0785 cubed is 0.0785 * 0.006162 \u2248 0.000483. Divided by 6 is about 0.0000805.\n\nSo e^0.0785 \u2248 1 + 0.0785 + 0.003081 + 0.0000805 \u2248 1.0816615.\n\nSo e^0.5785 = e^0.5 * e^0.0785 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.0816615.\n\nLet's compute that.\n\n1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872.\n\n1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976.\n\n1.64872 * 0.0016615 \u2248 approximately 0.00273.\n\nSo adding up: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.00273 = approx 1.78335.\n\nSo e^0.5785 \u2248 1.78335 \u2192 e^-0.5785 \u2248 1/1.78335 \u2248 0.5595.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5595 = 0.4405, which is 44.05%, so approximately 44%. That's option A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The initial 100-minute data gives P(100)=0.32, which implies \u03bb=0.00385662 per minute.\n\nSo, using this \u03bb, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.00385662 * 150) = 1 - e^(-0.578493) \u2248 1 - 0.5595 \u2248 0.4405, which is 44%.\n\nBut wait, the options have 44% as option A, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything.\n\nWait, another approach: The half-life. Because sometimes using half-life is easier. Let's compute the half-life from the given data.\n\nThe decay probability P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). The half-life T_1/2 is the time when P(t) = 0.5, so 0.5 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb T_1/2) \u2192 e^(-\u03bb T_1/2) = 0.5 \u2192 \u03bb T_1/2 = ln(2) \u2192 T_1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb.\n\nWait, from our previous calculation, \u03bb is 0.00385662 per minute. So T_1/2 = 0.6931 / 0.00385662 \u2248 ?\n\nCompute 0.6931 / 0.00385662 \u2248 Let's see, 0.00385662 is approximately 0.003857. So 0.6931 / 0.003857 \u2248 180 minutes. Hmm, that's an interesting number. Because 180 is 100 + 80. So the half-life is 180 minutes.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial data is that in 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32%. So if the half-life is 180 minutes, then after 100 minutes, the probability of decay would be P(100) = 1 - e^(-ln(2) * 100 / 180) ) = 1 - e^(- (0.6931/1.8)) ) = 1 - e^(-0.385) \u2248 1 - 0.68 \u2248 0.32, which matches the given data.\n\nSo, the half-life is 180 minutes.\n\nNow, the question is, after 50 minutes, what's the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. But as I thought earlier, the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next T minutes is the same regardless of previous time. So the probability is the same as the probability of decay within 150 minutes from now.\n\nAlternatively, since the half-life is 180 minutes, let's compute the decay probability for 150 minutes. Let me compute P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150) = 1 - e^(-ln(2)*150/180) ) = 1 - e^(- (ln(2) * 5/6) )\n\nCompute ln(2) is approx 0.6931. 5/6 is approx 0.8333.\n\nSo 0.6931 * 0.8333 \u2248 0.580.\n\nSo, e^(-0.580) \u2248 0.559, so 1 - 0.559 = 0.441, which is 44.1%, which is about 44%, option A.\n\nWait, but wait, another approach: Since the half-life is 180 minutes, the decay probability in t minutes is P(t) = 1 - e^(- ln(2) * t / T_1/2). So for t=150, that's 150/180 = 5/6 of a half-life.\n\nSo, ln(2) * (5/6) \u2248 0.6931 * 0.8333 \u2248 0.5776.\n\nSo e^-0.5776 \u2248 0.561 \u2192 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, about 43.9%, which rounds to 44%, so option A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the initial approach. The problem says that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. So from this, I found \u03bb, which I then used to find the probability for 150 minutes, which came out to about 44%. So the answer should be A) 44%.\n",

So 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's approximate. 0.57855 is 0.57855 - 0.5 = 0.07855 above 0.5. So the e^-0.57855 is between 0.6065 and 0.5488. Let's see, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator.\n\nWait, let me calculate it more accurately. Let me use a calculator-like approach. Let's compute 0.57855.\n\ne^x for x = 0.57855:\n\nWe can use the Taylor series, but that might take too long. Alternatively, I can use known values. Alternatively, perhaps using natural logarithm tables, but I think it's easier to approximate.\n\nAlternatively, using logarithm tables or a calculator. Let's think: ln(2) is about 0.6931. So 0.57855 is approximately 0.6931 * 0.835. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute e^(-0.57855) \u2248 1/(e^0.57855). Let me compute e^0.57855.\n\nWe know that e^0.5 \u2248 1.6487, e^0.6 \u2248 1.8221, e^0.58 is approximately? Let me compute 0.57855 is 0.58 approximately.\n\nLet me compute e^0.58. Using the Taylor series around x=0.5:\n\ne^x = e^0.5 * e^0.08.\n\nWe know e^0.5 \u2248 1.64872.\n\ne^0.08 is approximately 1 + 0.08 + (0.08)^2/2 + (0.08)^3/6 + (0.08)^4/24.\n\nSo that's 1 + 0.08 = 1.08.\n\nPlus (0.0064)/2 = 0.0032 \u2192 1.0832.\n\nPlus (0.000512)/6 \u2248 0.000085 \u2192 1.083285.\n\nPlus (0.00004096)/24 \u2248 0.0000017 \u2192 approximately 1.0832867.\n\nSo e^0.08 \u2248 1.0832867.\n\nSo e^0.58 \u2248 e^0.5 * e^0.08 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.0832867 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute 1.64872 * 1.0832867.\n\n1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872.\n\n1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976.\n\n1.64872 * 0.0032867 \u2248 approx 0.0054.\n\nSo adding up: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.0054 \u2248 1.786.\n\nSo e^0.58 \u2248 1.786, so e^(-0.58) \u2248 1/1.786 \u2248 0.5586.\n\nWait, but 0.57855 is a bit higher than 0.58, so e^0.57855 is a bit less than e^0.58. So e^(-0.57855) is a bit higher than 0.5586.\n\nWait, but wait, 0.57855 is 0.57855 = 0.58 + 0.00145. So e^0.57855 = e^(0.58 - 0.00145) = e^0.58 * e^(-0.00145). \n\nWe have e^0.58 \u2248 1.786, e^-0.00145 \u2248 0.99855. So 1.786 * 0.99855 \u2248 1.786 - (1.786 * 0.00145) \u2192 1.786 - 0.00258 \u2248 1.7834.\n\nSo e^0.57855 \u2248 1.7834, so e^-0.57855 \u2248 1/1.7834 \u2248 0.5595.\n\nSo approximately 0.5595. So 1 - 0.5595 = 0.4405, which is about 44.05%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 44%, so that's close.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a more precise method to compute \u03bb.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's compute \u03bb again. We have e^(-\u03bb * 100) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100.\n\nln(0.68) is approximately -0.385662. So \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nCompute \u03bb*150 = 0.00385662 * 150 = 0.578493.\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) = ?\n\nLet me compute this more accurately. Let me use the fact that e^(-x) \u2248 1 - x + x\u00b2/2 - x\u00b3/6 + ... but that might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a calculator or known logarithms, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can use the fact that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.\n\nWait, 0.578493 is approximately 0.5785. Let me think about e^-0.5785.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for e^x for x = -0.5785.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute e^0.5785 first, then take reciprocal.\n\nSo e^0.5785.\n\nWe can use the Taylor expansion around x=0.5.\n\ne^x = e^0.5 * e^{x-0.5}.\n\nSo x is 0.5785, so x-0.5 = 0.0785.\n\ne^{0.0785} \u2248 1 + 0.0785 + (0.0785^2)/2 + (0.0785^3)/6.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n0.0785 squared is approximately 0.006162. Divided by 2 is 0.003081.\n\n0.0785 cubed is 0.0785 * 0.006162 \u2248 0.000483. Divided by 6 is about 0.0000805.\n\nSo e^0.0785 \u2248 1 + 0.0785 + 0.003081 + 0.0000805 \u2248 1.0816615.\n\nSo e^0.5785 = e^0.5 * e^0.0785 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.0816615.\n\nLet's compute that.\n\n1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872.\n\n1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976.\n\n1.64872 * 0.0016615 \u2248 approximately 0.00273.\n\nSo adding up: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.00273 = approx 1.78335.\n\nSo e^0.5785 \u2248 1.78335 \u2192 e^-0.5785 \u2248 1/1.78335 \u2248 0.5595.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5595 = 0.4405, which is 44.05%, so approximately 44%. That's option A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The initial 100-minute data gives P(100)=0.32, which implies \u03bb=0.00385662 per minute.\n\nSo, using this \u03bb, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.00385662 * 150) = 1 - e^(-0.578493) \u2248 1 - 0.5595 \u2248 0.4405, which is 44%.\n\nBut wait, the options have 44% as option A, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything.\n\nWait, another approach: The half-life. Because sometimes using half-life is easier. Let's compute the half-life from the given data.\n\nThe decay probability P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). The half-life T_1/2 is the time when P(t) = 0.5, so 0.5 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb T_1/2) \u2192 e^(-\u03bb T_1/2) = 0.5 \u2192 \u03bb T_1/2 = ln(2) \u2192 T_1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb.\n\nWait, from our previous calculation, \u03bb is 0.00385662 per minute. So T_1/2 = 0.6931 / 0.00385662 \u2248 ?\n\nCompute 0.6931 / 0.00385662 \u2248 Let's see, 0.00385662 is approximately 0.003857. So 0.6931 / 0.003857 \u2248 180 minutes. Hmm, that's an interesting number. Because 180 is 100 + 80. So the half-life is 180 minutes.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial data is that in 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32%. So if the half-life is 180 minutes, then after 100 minutes, the probability of decay would be P(100) = 1 - e^(-ln(2) * 100 / 180) ) = 1 - e^(- (0.6931/1.8)) ) = 1 - e^(-0.385) \u2248 1 - 0.68 \u2248 0.32, which matches the given data.\n\nSo, the half-life is 180 minutes.\n\nNow, the question is, after 50 minutes, what's the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. But as I thought earlier, the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next T minutes is the same regardless of previous time. So the probability is the same as the probability of decay within 150 minutes from now.\n\nAlternatively, since the half-life is 180 minutes, let's compute the decay probability for 150 minutes. Let me compute P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150) = 1 - e^(-ln(2)*150/180) ) = 1 - e^(- (ln(2) * 5/6) )\n\nCompute ln(2) is approx 0.6931. 5/6 is approx 0.8333.\n\nSo 0.6931 * 0.8333 \u2248 0.580.\n\nSo, e^(-0.580) \u2248 0.559, so 1 - 0.559 = 0.441, which is 44.1%, which is about 44%, option A.\n\nWait, but wait, another approach: Since the half-life is 180 minutes, the decay probability in t minutes is P(t) = 1 - e^(- ln(2) * t / T_1/2). So for t=150, that's 150/180 = 5/6 of a half-life.\n\nSo, ln(2) * (5/6) \u2248 0.6931 * 0.8333 \u2248 0.5776.\n\nSo e^-0.5776 \u2248 0.561 \u2192 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, about 43.9%, which rounds to 44%, so option A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the initial approach. The problem says that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. So from this, I found \u03bb, which I then used to find the probability for 150 minutes, which came out to about 44%. So the answer should be A) 44%.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, we start by analyzing the given data. The decay probability of the atom within 100 minutes is 32%, which means the probability of not decaying in 100 minutes is 68% (\\(1 - 0.32 = 0.68\\)). Using the exponential decay formula:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{not decay}}(t) = e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nwe can solve for the decay constant \\(\\lambda\\). Substituting \\(t = 100\\) and \\(P_{\\text{not decay}}(100) = 0.68\\):\n\n\\[\ne^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.68\n\\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\n-\\lambda \\cdot 100 = \\ln(0.68)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\(\\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.3857\\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.3857}{100} \\approx 0.003857 \\, \\text{per minute}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. The probability of decay in time \\(t\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{decay}}(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\lambda = 0.003857\\) and \\(t = 150\\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\cdot 150 = 0.003857 \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.57855\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{decay}}(150) = 1 - e^{-0.57855}\n\\]\n\nTo compute \\(e^{-0.57855}\\), we approximate it as \\(e^{-0.57855} \\approx 0.5595\\). Thus:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{decay}}(150) = 1 - 0.5595 \\approx 0.4405\n\\]\n\nThis corresponds to a 44.05% probability, which rounds to 44%. The memoryless property of radioactive decay confirms that the past 50 minutes do not affect this probability, as it only depends on the decay constant \\(\\lambda\\) and the time interval of interest (150 minutes).\n\nFinally, comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:\n\n**A) 44%**\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me think. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? So each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time.\n\nThe question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Oh wait, so that's like the probability that the atom decays in the first 100 minutes. So after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it's decayed, which means there's a 68% chance it hasn't decayed yet.\n\nNow, the situation is that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. So we're looking for the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, that's a total of 50 + 150 = 200 minutes since the start. But wait, no, because the initial 100 minutes were the time frame for the 32% probability. So maybe I need to think in terms of the decay constant.\n\nLet me recall the formula. The probability that an atom has not decayed after time t is P = e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. So the probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt).\n\nGiven that in 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32% (0.32), so:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100)\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\nTake natural log on both sides:\n-100\u03bb = ln(0.68)\n\u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100\n\nCalculating ln(0.68). I think ln(0.5) is about -0.693, and ln(0.68) would be a bit higher, maybe around -0.385? Let me see, exact value: ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So \u03bb is 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute ln(0.68). Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it as ln(1 - 0.32) = ln(0.68). Hmm, but let's proceed.\n\nNow, the atom hasn't decayed after 50 minutes. So the probability that it hasn't decayed after 50 minutes is P = e^(-\u03bb*50). Let me compute that. So, using \u03bb = 0.0038566 per minute,\n\ne^(-0.0038566 *50) = e^(-0.19283) \u2248 0.825. So about 82.5% chance it hasn't decayed after 50 minutes.\n\nWait, but the question is, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes? That is, from t=50 to t=200 minutes. So the time interval is 150 minutes.\n\nSo the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the probability that it decays in that interval. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability only depends on the time remaining.\n\nSo the probability it hasn't decayed by t=50 is e^(-\u03bb*50), and the probability it hasn't decayed by t=200 is e^(-\u03bb*200). The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is the difference: e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The probability that it decays by time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So the probability that it decays after 50 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb (50 + 150)) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nBut wait, the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50 is e^(-\u03bb*50), and the probability it hasn't decayed by 200 is e^(-\u03bb*200). So the probability it decays between 50 and 200 is [e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb)].\n\nAlternatively, since the decay process is memoryless, the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes from time zero, given that it hasn't decayed yet.\n\nWait, no. Because the process is memoryless, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. Because the past doesn't affect the future. So given that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed, the remaining probability is based on the remaining time.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because the original probability was given for 100 minutes. So perhaps I should find the decay constant and then compute the probability for 150 minutes from the current time.\n\nLet me clarify. The initial decay probability is given as 32% over 100 minutes. So, we can find the decay constant \u03bb.\n\nOnce we have \u03bb, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb t).\n\nWait, but wait. The 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting now, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150). But since it's memoryless, that's correct.\n\nSo let me compute \u03bb first. From the given data:\n\nP(t=100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb)\n\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68\n\nTake ln of both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68). Let me compute it accurately. ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566.\n\nSo \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the time we're interested in is 150 minutes. So the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is:\n\nP = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) \u2192 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 150)\n\nCalculate 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) \u2248 let's compute that. I know that e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, and e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488.\n\nSo 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me compute e^(-0.57849). Maybe using a calculator approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the approximation: e^x \u2248 1 + x + x\u00b2/2 for small x. But 0.578 is not that small, so maybe better to use another method.\n\nAlternatively, using a Taylor series expansion around x=0.5:\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.57849.\n\nAlternatively, I can think that ln(0.56) is approximately -0.5798, since ln(0.5)= -0.6931, ln(0.56)=?\n\nWait, let me compute ln(0.56). Let me see: e^-0.57849 = ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as 1 / e^0.57849.\n\ne^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.57 is e^(0.5+0.07) = 1.6487 * e^0.07. e^0.07 \u2248 1.0725, so 1.6487 * 1.0725 \u2248 1.773.\n\nWait, e^0.57 \u2248 1.769.\n\nWait, but 0.57849 is approximately 0.5785, which is a bit higher than 0.57.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute e^0.57849.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nWe know that e^0.5 \u2248 1.64872.\n\ne^0.57849 = e^(0.5 + 0.07849) = e^0.5 * e^0.07849.\n\ne^0.07849: Let's compute that.\n\ne^0.07 \u2248 1.072508, e^0.07849 \u2248 1.082.\n\nBecause 0.07849 is approximately 0.0785. So e^0.0785 \u2248 1.082 (exact value is about 1.08203).\n\nSo e^0.57849 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08203 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08.\n\n1.64872 *1 = 1.64872, 1.64872 *0.08 = 0.1318976. So sum is about 1.7806.\n\nSo e^0.57849 \u2248 1.7806 \u2192 e^-0.57849 \u2248 1 / 1.7806 \u2248 0.5616.\n\nSo P = 1 - 0.5616 = 0.4384 \u2192 approximately 43.84%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 44%, option D is 48%, B is 40%, C is 52%. So 44% is option A.\n\nWait, but wait. Did I make a mistake? Because another approach is considering that the decay probability for 150 minutes, given that 50 have passed. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the probability from time 0 to 200 minutes, but subtracting the decay probability up to 50.\n\nWait no, the question is, after 50 minutes, what's the probability it decays in the next 150. So the way I approached it is correct, using the memoryless property.\n\nSo the probability is approximately 43.8%, which is closest to option A (44%).\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCompute \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 \u2192 ln(1/0.68)= ln(1.470588) \u2248 0.38566 \u2192 \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nThen, 150 * \u03bb = 150 * 0.0038566 = 0.57849.\n\nCompute e^-0.57849.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me think. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? So each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time.\n\nThe question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Oh wait, so that's like the probability that the atom decays in the first 100 minutes. So after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it's decayed, which means there's a 68% chance it hasn't decayed yet.\n\nNow, the situation is that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. So we're looking for the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, that's a total of 50 + 150 = 200 minutes since the start. But wait, no, because the initial 100 minutes were the time frame for the 32% probability. So maybe I need to think in terms of the decay constant.\n\nLet me recall the formula. The probability that an atom has not decayed after time t is P = e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. So the probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt).\n\nGiven that in 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32% (0.32), so:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100)\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\nTake natural log on both sides:\n-100\u03bb = ln(0.68)\n\u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100\n\nCalculating ln(0.68). I think ln(0.5) is about -0.693, and ln(0.68) would be a bit higher, maybe around -0.385? Let me see, exact value: ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So \u03bb is 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute ln(0.68). Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it as ln(1 - 0.32) = ln(0.68). Hmm, but let's proceed.\n\nNow, the atom hasn't decayed after 50 minutes. So the probability that it hasn't decayed after 50 minutes is P = e^(-\u03bb*50). Let me compute that. So, using \u03bb = 0.0038566 per minute,\n\ne^(-0.0038566 *50) = e^(-0.19283) \u2248 0.825. So about 82.5% chance it hasn't decayed after 50 minutes.\n\nWait, but the question is, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes? That is, from t=50 to t=200 minutes. So the time interval is 150 minutes.\n\nSo the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the probability that it decays in that interval. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability only depends on the time remaining.\n\nSo the probability it hasn't decayed by t=50 is e^(-\u03bb*50), and the probability it hasn't decayed by t=200 is e^(-\u03bb*200). The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is the difference: e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The probability that it decays by time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So the probability that it decays after 50 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb (50 + 150)) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nBut wait, the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50 is e^(-\u03bb*50), and the probability it hasn't decayed by 200 is e^(-\u03bb*200). So the probability it decays between 50 and 200 is [e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb)].\n\nAlternatively, since the decay process is memoryless, the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes from time zero, given that it hasn't decayed yet.\n\nWait, no. Because the process is memoryless, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. Because the past doesn't affect the future. So given that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed, the remaining probability is based on the remaining time.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because the original probability was given for 100 minutes. So perhaps I should find the decay constant and then compute the probability for 150 minutes from the current time.\n\nLet me clarify. The initial decay probability is given as 32% over 100 minutes. So, we can find the decay constant \u03bb.\n\nOnce we have \u03bb, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb t).\n\nWait, but wait. The 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting now, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150). But since it's memoryless, that's correct.\n\nSo let me compute \u03bb first. From the given data:\n\nP(t=100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb)\n\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68\n\nTake ln of both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68). Let me compute it accurately. ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566.\n\nSo \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the time we're interested in is 150 minutes. So the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is:\n\nP = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) \u2192 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 150)\n\nCalculate 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) \u2248 let's compute that. I know that e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, and e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488.\n\nSo 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me compute e^(-0.57849). Maybe using a calculator approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the approximation: e^x \u2248 1 + x + x\u00b2/2 for small x. But 0.578 is not that small, so maybe better to use another method.\n\nAlternatively, using a Taylor series expansion around x=0.5:\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.57849.\n\nAlternatively, I can think that ln(0.56) is approximately -0.5798, since ln(0.5)= -0.6931, ln(0.56)=?\n\nWait, let me compute ln(0.56). Let me see: e^-0.57849 = ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as 1 / e^0.57849.\n\ne^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.57 is e^(0.5+0.07) = 1.6487 * e^0.07. e^0.07 \u2248 1.0725, so 1.6487 * 1.0725 \u2248 1.773.\n\nWait, e^0.57 \u2248 1.769.\n\nWait, but 0.57849 is approximately 0.5785, which is a bit higher than 0.57.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute e^0.57849.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nWe know that e^0.5 \u2248 1.64872.\n\ne^0.57849 = e^(0.5 + 0.07849) = e^0.5 * e^0.07849.\n\ne^0.07849: Let's compute that.\n\ne^0.07 \u2248 1.072508, e^0.07849 \u2248 1.082.\n\nBecause 0.07849 is approximately 0.0785. So e^0.0785 \u2248 1.082 (exact value is about 1.08203).\n\nSo e^0.57849 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08203 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08.\n\n1.64872 *1 = 1.64872, 1.64872 *0.08 = 0.1318976. So sum is about 1.7806.\n\nSo e^0.57849 \u2248 1.7806 \u2192 e^-0.57849 \u2248 1 / 1.7806 \u2248 0.5616.\n\nSo P = 1 - 0.5616 = 0.4384 \u2192 approximately 43.84%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 44%, option D is 48%, B is 40%, C is 52%. So 44% is option A.\n\nWait, but wait. Did I make a mistake? Because another approach is considering that the decay probability for 150 minutes, given that 50 have passed. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the probability from time 0 to 200 minutes, but subtracting the decay probability up to 50.\n\nWait no, the question is, after 50 minutes, what's the probability it decays in the next 150. So the way I approached it is correct, using the memoryless property.\n\nSo the probability is approximately 43.8%, which is closest to option A (44%).\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCompute \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 \u2192 ln(1/0.68)= ln(1.470588) \u2248 0.38566 \u2192 \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nThen, 150 * \u03bb = 150 * 0.0038566 = 0.57849.\n\nCompute e^-0.57849.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. \n\nWe have an atom that's supposed to decay with a certain probability. From previous experiments, the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet. The question is asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are A to D, with percentages ranging from 40% to 52%.\n\nHmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The probability that a nucleus decays doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Oh right, that's the memoryless property of the exponential distribution. So, even if the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, the probability of it decaying in the next period only depends on the remaining time, not the time already elapsed.\n\nWait, but the given decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. Let me think about that. The decay probability (or the probability that it has decayed) is given as 32% for a 100-minute period. So, the decay constant or the probability per unit time must be related to this.\n\nI think the formula for the probability of decay is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant and t is the time. So, in this case, when t is 100 minutes, P is 0.32. Let me write that down:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100)\n\nSo, solving for \u03bb. Let's rearrange:\n\ne^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n-100\u03bb = ln(0.68)\n\n\u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100\n\nCalculating ln(0.68), I remember ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, and 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5. Let me think, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3857 (since I recall ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, but wait, 0.68 is a bit lower, so maybe closer to -0.385). So:\n\n\u03bb \u2248 0.3857 / 100 = 0.003857 per minute.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute ln(0.68). Let me think, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108, ln(0.65)= around -0.4308, ln(0.7)= -0.3567, ln(0.68) is between ln(0.65) and ln(0.7). Let me approximate it. Using a calculator (pretending I'm doing it step by step), 0.68. Let's see, ln(0.68)= ln(68/100)= ln(17/25). Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as 0.68= e^x, solve for x.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a Taylor series or other approximation, but maybe it's easier to just note that ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. So, that's about right. So \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is about the next 150 minutes. Wait, but 50 minutes have already passed. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes from now, regardless of the 50 minutes that have already passed.\n\nWait, but the initial 100 minutes were a different scenario. Let me think again. Oh, no, the question is about the next 150 minutes, starting from now. So the time we're considering is 150 minutes, not 200. So, the time t is 150 minutes.\n\nSo, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWe have \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nCalculating \u03bb * 150 = 0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.5785.\n\nSo, e^(-0.5785) \u2248 ?\n\nI remember that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, and e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me approximate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate it more precisely. Let me compute 0.5785.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's use the Taylor series expansion for e^x around x=0. But maybe it's easier to use a calculator approach. Alternatively, I can use the approximation that e^(-x) \u2248 1 - x + x\u00b2/2 for small x, but 0.5785 isn't that small, so the approximation may not be too accurate. Alternatively, maybe I can remember that e^-0.57 \u2248 0.563, e^-0.58 \u2248 0.560, e^-0.585 is about 0.558, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step.\n\nBut perhaps I can compute 0.5785. Let me think. I know that ln(2) is about 0.6931, so e^-0.6931 = 0.5. Hmm. For 0.5785, which is less than 0.6931, so e^-0.5785 is higher than 0.5. Wait, but how much higher?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as 0.5785 = 0.5 + 0.0785. So, e^-0.5785 = e^-0.5 * e^-0.0785.\n\nWe know e^-0.5 is approximately 0.6065. Now, e^-0.0785: let's calculate that. The Taylor expansion for e^-x is approximately 1 - x + x\u00b2/2 - x^3/6. Let x=0.0785.\n\nSo e^-0.0785 \u2248 1 - 0.0785 + (0.0785)^2 / 2 - (0.0785)^3 / 6.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1) 1\n\n2) -0.0785 \u2192 0.9215\n\n3) (0.0785)^2 = 0.006162; divided by 2 is 0.003081 \u2192 adding 0.9215 + 0.003081 = 0.924581\n\n4) (0.0785)^3 = approx 0.0785 * 0.006162 \u2248 0.000483; divided by 6 is about 0.0000805 \u2192 subtracting: 0.924581 - 0.0000805 \u2248 0.9245.\n\nSo, e^-0.0785 \u2248 0.9245.\n\nSo, e^-0.5785 \u2248 e^-0.5 * e^-0.0785 \u2248 0.6065 * 0.9245 \u2248 ?\n\nCalculating 0.6065 * 0.9245:\n\n0.6 * 0.9 = 0.54\n\n0.6 * 0.0245 = ~0.0147\n\n0.0065 * 0.9 = 0.00585\n\n0.0065 * 0.0245 = ~0.000159\n\nAdding all together:\n\n0.54 + 0.0147 = 0.5547\n\n0.5547 + 0.00585 = 0.56055\n\n0.56055 + 0.000159 \u2248 0.5607.\n\nSo e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.5607.\n\nThus, the probability P is 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, approximately 43.93%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 44%, which is very close. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because perhaps I made an approximation error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate \u03bb more accurately. Let's go back.

Let me think, using a calculator-like approach. \n\nThe natural logarithm of 0.68 can be found using a calculator as approximately -0.38566248. So \u03bb = 0.38566248 / 100 = 0.0038566248 per minute.\n\nNow, the time we're interested in is 150 minutes. So \u03bb*t = 0.0038566248 * 150 = 0.57849372.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849372) = ?\n\nI can compute this using a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.5615. Let me check with more precise calculation.\n\nUsing the Taylor series for e^x around x=0:\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute it using known values. Alternatively, using a calculator, e^-0.5785 is approximately 0.5615. So P = 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385, or about 43.85%, which rounds to 44% \u2192 option A.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 44% as the only option. Looking back, option A is 44%, but option D is 48%. So that's the closest. But wait, wait, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute e^-0.57849372 more accurately.\n\nLet me think: 0.57849372 is approximately 0.5785.\n\nWe can use a calculator for this, but since I can't, I'll use a better approximation. Alternatively, perhaps using a known value.\n\nWait, 0.5785 is approximately 0.5772 + 0.0013. I know that e^-0.5772 \u2248 0.5615 (since 0.5772 is approximately ln(2)/\u221a3, but not sure). Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ln(0.5615) is about -0.5785.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute e^-0.5785 using a better method. Let me think: 0.5785 = 0.5 + 0.0785. So, as before, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, and e^-0.0785 is about 0.9245, as calculated earlier. So 0.6065 * 0.9245 = 0.5607.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before, giving P \u2248 43.93% \u2192 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA) 44%\n\nB) 40%\n\nC) 52%\n\nD) 48%\n\nSo option A is 44%. But the options given don't have 44% as the correct answer. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So the decay constant \u03bb can be found from the equation P = 1 - e^{-\u03bb t} = 0.32, t=100.\n\nSo, solving for \u03bb: \u03bb = (ln(1/(1 - 0.32)) ) / 100 = ln(1/0.68)/100 \u2192 ln(1.470588)/100 \u2248 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute, same as before.\n\nNow, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^{-\u03bb * 150}.\n\nSo, \u03bb * 150 = 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.\n\nSo, e^{-0.57849} \u2248 ?\n\nLet me think about e^-0.57849. I can use a calculator approximation. Let me try to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that e^0.57849 \u2248 1.783, so e^-0.57849 \u2248 1/1.783 \u2248 0.5606.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.5606 = 0.4394 \u2192 43.94%, which is about 44%. So option A is 44%.\n\nBut wait, another thought: the problem says that 50 minutes have passed without decay. Does that affect the calculation? No, because radioactive decay is memoryless. The probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of it decaying within 150 minutes starting from time zero, regardless of how much time has passed before.\n\nSo yes, the answer is approximately 44%, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me recheck the initial approach. The problem says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So P(100) = 0.32.\n\nSo, 0.32 = 1 - e^{-\u03bb *100}, so \u03bb = (ln(1/(1-0.32)) ) /100 = ln(1/0.68)/100.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThen, for t=150, P=1 - e^{-\u03bb *150}.\n\nBut wait, another approach: perhaps the decay constant can be found using the half-life formula. Wait, but the half-life T_1/2 is related to \u03bb by T_1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb \u2248 0.6931/\u03bb.\n\nBut perhaps that's a longer route. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the decay probability for 150 minutes directly.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e^-0.5785. Let me try to compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 0.57849372.\n\nLet me compute e^-0.57849372.\n\nI can use the Taylor series expansion around x=0:\n\ne^x = 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + x^4/4! + ... \n\nBut since x is negative, e^-x = 1/(e^x). Alternatively, for x =0.57849372, compute e^x and then invert.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute e^0.57849372.\n\ne^0.5 = 1.64872\n\ne^0.07849372: Let me compute that.\n\nLet me compute x = 0.07849372.\n\nCompute e^x using the Taylor series up to x^4.\n\ne^x \u2248 1 + x + x\u00b2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24.\n\nx=0.07849372.\n\nx\u00b2=0.07849372^2 \u2248 0.0061614.\n\nx\u00b3 \u2248 0.07849372 * 0.0061614 \u2248 0.0004832.\n\nx^4 \u2248 0.07849372 * 0.0004832 \u2248 0.0000380.\n\nSo,\n\ne^x \u2248 1 + 0.07849372 + (0.0061614)/2 + (0.0004832)/6 + (0.0000380)/24.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1) 1\n\n2) +0.07849372 \u2192 1.07849372\n\n3) +0.0030807 \u2192 1.08157442\n\n4) +0.00008053 \u2192 1.08165495\n\n5) +0.00000158 \u2192 1.08165653.\n\nSo, e^0.07849372 \u2248 1.08165653.\n\nSo, e^0.57849372 = e^(0.5 + 0.07849372) = e^0.5 * e^0.07849372 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08165653.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1.64872 * 1.08 = ?\n\n1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872\n\n1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976\n\nTotal \u2248 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176.\n\nBut more accurately, 1.64872 * 1.08165653:\n\nLet me compute 1.64872 * 1.08165653.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872\n\n1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976\n\n1.64872 * 0.00165653 \u2248 0.0027316.\n\nAdding them together: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.0027316 \u2248 1.7833492.\n\nSo, e^0.57849372 \u2248 1.7833492.\n\nTherefore, e^-0.57849372 \u2248 1 / 1.7833492 \u2248 0.5607.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, or 43.93%, which is approximately 44%.\n\nSo, the answer should be option A) 44%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. \n\nWe have an atom that's supposed to decay with a certain probability. From previous experiments, the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet. The question is asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are A to D, with percentages ranging from 40% to 52%.\n\nHmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The probability that a nucleus decays doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Oh right, that's the memoryless property of the exponential distribution. So, even if the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, the probability of it decaying in the next period only depends on the remaining time, not the time already elapsed.\n\nWait, but the given decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. Let me think about that. The decay probability (or the probability that it has decayed) is given as 32% for a 100-minute period. So, the decay constant or the probability per unit time must be related to this.\n\nI think the formula for the probability of decay is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant and t is the time. So, in this case, when t is 100 minutes, P is 0.32. Let me write that down:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100)\n\nSo, solving for \u03bb. Let's rearrange:\n\ne^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n-100\u03bb = ln(0.68)\n\n\u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100\n\nCalculating ln(0.68), I remember ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, and 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5. Let me think, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3857 (since I recall ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, but wait, 0.68 is a bit lower, so maybe closer to -0.385). So:\n\n\u03bb \u2248 0.3857 / 100 = 0.003857 per minute.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute ln(0.68). Let me think, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108, ln(0.65)= around -0.4308, ln(0.7)= -0.3567, ln(0.68) is between ln(0.65) and ln(0.7). Let me approximate it. Using a calculator (pretending I'm doing it step by step), 0.68. Let's see, ln(0.68)= ln(68/100)= ln(17/25). Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as 0.68= e^x, solve for x.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a Taylor series or other approximation, but maybe it's easier to just note that ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. So, that's about right. So \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is about the next 150 minutes. Wait, but 50 minutes have already passed. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes from now, regardless of the 50 minutes that have already passed.\n\nWait, but the initial 100 minutes were a different scenario. Let me think again. Oh, no, the question is about the next 150 minutes, starting from now. So the time we're considering is 150 minutes, not 200. So, the time t is 150 minutes.\n\nSo, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWe have \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nCalculating \u03bb * 150 = 0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.5785.\n\nSo, e^(-0.5785) \u2248 ?\n\nI remember that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, and e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me approximate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate it more precisely. Let me compute 0.5785.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's use the Taylor series expansion for e^x around x=0. But maybe it's easier to use a calculator approach. Alternatively, I can use the approximation that e^(-x) \u2248 1 - x + x\u00b2/2 for small x, but 0.5785 isn't that small, so the approximation may not be too accurate. Alternatively, maybe I can remember that e^-0.57 \u2248 0.563, e^-0.58 \u2248 0.560, e^-0.585 is about 0.558, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step.\n\nBut perhaps I can compute 0.5785. Let me think. I know that ln(2) is about 0.6931, so e^-0.6931 = 0.5. Hmm. For 0.5785, which is less than 0.6931, so e^-0.5785 is higher than 0.5. Wait, but how much higher?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as 0.5785 = 0.5 + 0.0785. So, e^-0.5785 = e^-0.5 * e^-0.0785.\n\nWe know e^-0.5 is approximately 0.6065. Now, e^-0.0785: let's calculate that. The Taylor expansion for e^-x is approximately 1 - x + x\u00b2/2 - x^3/6. Let x=0.0785.\n\nSo e^-0.0785 \u2248 1 - 0.0785 + (0.0785)^2 / 2 - (0.0785)^3 / 6.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1) 1\n\n2) -0.0785 \u2192 0.9215\n\n3) (0.0785)^2 = 0.006162; divided by 2 is 0.003081 \u2192 adding 0.9215 + 0.003081 = 0.924581\n\n4) (0.0785)^3 = approx 0.0785 * 0.006162 \u2248 0.000483; divided by 6 is about 0.0000805 \u2192 subtracting: 0.924581 - 0.0000805 \u2248 0.9245.\n\nSo, e^-0.0785 \u2248 0.9245.\n\nSo, e^-0.5785 \u2248 e^-0.5 * e^-0.0785 \u2248 0.6065 * 0.9245 \u2248 ?\n\nCalculating 0.6065 * 0.9245:\n\n0.6 * 0.9 = 0.54\n\n0.6 * 0.0245 = ~0.0147\n\n0.0065 * 0.9 = 0.00585\n\n0.0065 * 0.0245 = ~0.000159\n\nAdding all together:\n\n0.54 + 0.0147 = 0.5547\n\n0.5547 + 0.00585 = 0.56055\n\n0.56055 + 0.000159 \u2248 0.5607.\n\nSo e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.5607.\n\nThus, the probability P is 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, approximately 43.93%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 44%, which is very close.

So the decay constant \u03bb can be found from the equation P = 1 - e^{-\u03bb t} = 0.32, t=100.\n\nSo, solving for \u03bb: \u03bb = (ln(1/(1 - 0.32)) ) / 100 = ln(1/0.68)/100 \u2192 ln(1.470588)/100 \u2248 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute, same as before.\n\nNow, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^{-\u03bb * 150}.\n\nSo, \u03bb * 150 = 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.\n\nSo, e^{-0.57849} \u2248 ?\n\nLet me think about e^-0.57849. I can use a calculator approximation. Let me try to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that e^0.57849 \u2248 1.783, so e^-0.57849 \u2248 1/1.783 \u2248 0.5606.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.5606 = 0.4394 \u2192 43.94%, which is about 44%. So option A is 44%.\n\nBut wait, another thought: the problem says that 50 minutes have passed without decay. Does that affect the calculation? No, because radioactive decay is memoryless. The probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of it decaying within 150 minutes starting from time zero, regardless of how much time has passed before.\n\nSo yes, the answer is approximately 44%, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me recheck the initial approach. The problem says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So P(100) = 0.32.\n\nSo, 0.32 = 1 - e^{-\u03bb *100}, so \u03bb = (ln(1/(1-0.32)) ) /100 = ln(1/0.68)/100.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThen, for t=150, P=1 - e^{-\u03bb *150}.\n\nBut wait, another approach: perhaps the decay constant can be found using the half-life formula. Wait, but the half-life T_1/2 is related to \u03bb by T_1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb \u2248 0.6931/\u03bb.\n\nBut perhaps that's a longer route. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the decay probability for 150 minutes directly.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e^-0.5785. Let me try to compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 0.57849372.\n\nLet me compute e^-0.57849372.\n\nI can use the Taylor series expansion around x=0:\n\ne^x = 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + x^4/4! + ... \n\nBut since x is negative, e^-x = 1/(e^x). Alternatively, for x =0.57849372, compute e^x and then invert.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute e^0.57849372.\n\ne^0.5 = 1.64872\n\ne^0.07849372: Let me compute that.\n\nLet me compute x = 0.07849372.\n\nCompute e^x using the Taylor series up to x^4.\n\ne^x \u2248 1 + x + x\u00b2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24.\n\nx=0.07849372.\n\nx\u00b2=0.07849372^2 \u2248 0.0061614.\n\nx\u00b3 \u2248 0.07849372 * 0.0061614 \u2248 0.0004832.\n\nx^4 \u2248 0.07849372 * 0.0004832 \u2248 0.0000380.\n\nSo,\n\ne^x \u2248 1 + 0.07849372 + (0.0061614)/2 + (0.0004832)/6 + (0.0000380)/24.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1) 1\n\n2) +0.07849372 \u2192 1.07849372\n\n3) +0.0030807 \u2192 1.08157442\n\n4) +0.00008053 \u2192 1.08165495\n\n5) +0.00000158 \u2192 1.08165653.\n\nSo, e^0.07849372 \u2248 1.08165653.\n\nSo, e^0.57849372 = e^(0.5 + 0.07849372) = e^0.5 * e^0.07849372 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08165653.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1.64872 * 1.08 = ?\n\n1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872\n\n1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976\n\nTotal \u2248 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176.\n\nBut more accurately, 1.64872 * 1.08165653:\n\nLet me compute 1.64872 * 1.08165653.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872\n\n1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976\n\n1.64872 * 0.00165653 \u2248 0.0027316.\n\nAdding them together: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.0027316 \u2248 1.7833492.\n\nSo, e^0.57849372 \u2248 1.7833492.\n\nTherefore, e^-0.57849372 \u2248 1 / 1.7833492 \u2248 0.5607.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, or 43.93%, which is approximately 44%.\n\nSo, the answer should be option A) 44%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model, which states that the probability of a nucleus decaying in a given time period is memoryless.

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. But wait, how exactly does that work?\n\nThe question says that a particular atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it's decayed.

Or is it 150 minutes from now? Let me read that again.\n\nOh right, the initial 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, what's the chance it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, the next 150 minutes would be from the current time, which is 50 minutes into the 100-minute period. Or is the 150 minutes in addition to the 50? Wait, no, the way the question is phrased, the total time after the initial 50 minutes is 150 minutes. Or maybe it's 150 minutes from now, regardless of the initial 100 minutes. Wait, no, the initial decay probability is given for 100 minutes, so maybe the 150 is an extension beyond that?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The initial setup: the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, perhaps that 32% is the cumulative probability over 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Or maybe it's the next 150 minutes starting from now, so total time from the beginning would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, the initial 100 minutes had a 32% chance. So perhaps the question is, what is the probability it decays between 50 and 200 minutes? Or is it the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, which would be 50 to 200?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 150 minutes is just the time from now, so 150 minutes from the current 50-minute mark. So the time left is 150 minutes. But the initial condition was for 100 minutes. Hmm.\n\nWait, I think I need to model this using the concept of radioactive decay. Radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The decay probability is given by the formula N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant and t is time.\n\nBut wait, the probability that a nucleus decays in a certain time is given by 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). Because N(t) is the number remaining, so 1 - N(t)/N0 is the number that have decayed.\n\nSo first, I need to find \u03bb. The problem states that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. So:\n\n1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100) = 0.32\n=> e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68\nTake natural logarithm on both sides:\n-100\u03bb = ln(0.68)\n\u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100\n\nLet me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately... Well, ln(1)=0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693, and 0.68 is close to 0.7. Let me think: ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566 (I can check this with a calculator, but for now, let's say around -0.3857).\n\nSo \u03bb \u2248 0.3857 / 100 = 0.003857 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So the probability it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is:\n\nP(not decayed in 50 min) = e^(-\u03bb * 50) = e^(-0.003857 *50) = e^(-0.19285) \u2248 0.8247.\n\nSo the probability that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is about 82.47%. Which makes sense, since the 100-minute probability is 32%, so in 50 minutes it's less likely to have decayed.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? Wait, but is that 150 minutes from the start, or from the current time (50 minutes into the 100-minute period)? Wait, the initial setup says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So I think we're being asked, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. So the total time would be 200 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 150 minutes is the remaining time beyond the initial 100 minutes, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, the question is phrased as: \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.\" So from the current time, the next 150 minutes. So from 50 minutes to 200 minutes. So the time elapsed from the start is 200 minutes.\n\nSo the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the same as the probability it decays by 200 minutes minus the probability it decayed by 50 minutes.\n\nSo P(decay in next 150 min) = P(decay by 200 min) - P(decay by 50 min)\n\nWe already have \u03bb. Let's compute each.\n\nP(decay by 200 min) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)\nSimilarly, P(decay by 50 min) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)\n\nSo the difference is [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)\n\nLet me compute these values.\n\nWe have \u03bb \u2248 0.003857 per minute.\n\nCompute e^(-\u03bb * 50):\n\n\u03bb *50 = 0.003857 *50 = 0.19285 \u2192 e^(-0.19285) \u2248 0.8247\n\ne^(-\u03bb *200): 0.003857 *200 = 0.7714 \u2192 e^(-0.7714) \u2248 0.462\n\nSo the difference is 0.8247 - 0.462 \u2248 0.3627, or 36.27%.\n\nWait, but that's not one of the options. The options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%. So that suggests I might have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the time frame. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking, after 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes from that point, which would be 150 minutes after the 50-minute mark. So from t=50 to t=200, which is 150 minutes. So that's what I just calculated, giving approximately 36% probability. But that's not matching any of the options.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the decay follows a Poisson process, so the probability of decay in a certain time is independent of previous events. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in 50.\n\nAlternatively, conditional probability: the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed before 50 minutes.\n\nSo that's equal to [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] divided by [1 - (1 - e^(-\u03bb *50))] = [e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / e^(-\u03bb*50) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*(200-50)) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)\n\nWait, that's another approach. Because the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is equal to the probability it decays in that 150-minute window.\n\nBut wait, in an exponential distribution, the memoryless property states that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in any 150-minute period, regardless of when you start.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is simply P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the exponential distribution is memoryless. So the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is independent of the previous 50 minutes.\n\nSo let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, find \u03bb. As before, 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.32 \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68 \u2192 \u03bb= ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100 \u2248 (0.38566)/100 = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo 150 minutes: P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 *150) \u2192 compute 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.\n\ne^(-0.57849) \u2248 0.562.\n\nSo 1 - 0.562 = 0.438, which is approximately 43.8%. So the closest option is 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 36% when considering the difference between 200 and 50 minutes, but that approach was wrong because it's not a 150-minute period from the current time, but rather 150 minutes from now, which, due to the memoryless property, is 43.8% or 44%.\n\nSo the correct answer would be 44%, option A.\n",

So the total time would be 200 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 150 minutes is the remaining time beyond the initial 100 minutes, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, the question is phrased as: \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.\" So from the current time, the next 150 minutes. So from 50 minutes to 200 minutes. So the time elapsed from the start is 200 minutes.\n\nSo the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the same as the probability it decays by 200 minutes minus the probability it decayed by 50 minutes.\n\nSo P(decay in next 150 min) = P(decay by 200 min) - P(decay by 50 min)\n\nWe already have \u03bb. Let's compute each.\n\nP(decay by 200 min) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)\nSimilarly, P(decay by 50 min) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)\n\nSo the difference is [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)\n\nLet me compute these values.\n\nWe have \u03bb \u2248 0.003857 per minute.\n\nCompute e^(-\u03bb * 50):\n\n\u03bb *50 = 0.003857 *50 = 0.19285 \u2192 e^(-0.19285) \u2248 0.8247\n\ne^(-\u03bb *200): 0.003857 *200 = 0.7714 \u2192 e^(-0.7714) \u2248 0.462\n\nSo the difference is 0.8247 - 0.462 \u2248 0.3627, or 36.27%.\n\nWait, but that's not one of the options. The options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%. So that suggests I might have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the time frame. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking, after 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes from that point, which would be 150 minutes after the 50-minute mark. So from t=50 to t=200, which is 150 minutes. So that's what I just calculated, giving approximately 36% probability. But that's not matching any of the options.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the decay follows a Poisson process, so the probability of decay in a certain time is independent of previous events. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in 50.\n\nAlternatively, conditional probability: the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed before 50 minutes.\n\nSo that's equal to [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] divided by [1 - (1 - e^(-\u03bb *50))] = [e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / e^(-\u03bb*50) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*(200-50)) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)\n\nWait, that's another approach. Because the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is equal to the probability it decays in that 150-minute window.\n\nBut wait, in an exponential distribution, the memoryless property states that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in any 150-minute period, regardless of when you start.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is simply P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the exponential distribution is memoryless. So the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is independent of the previous 50 minutes.\n\nSo let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, find \u03bb. As before, 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.32 \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68 \u2192 \u03bb= ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100 \u2248 (0.38566)/100 = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo 150 minutes: P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 *150) \u2192 compute 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.\n\ne^(-0.57849) \u2248 0.562.\n\nSo 1 - 0.562 = 0.438, which is approximately 43.8%. So the closest option is 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 36% when considering the difference between 200 and 50 minutes, but that approach was wrong because it's not a 150-minute period from the current time, but rather 150 minutes from now, which, due to the memoryless property, is 43.8% or 44%.\n\nSo the correct answer would be 44%, option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law and the memoryless property of radioactive decay. The decay probability of an atom within a given time follows the formula:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{decay in time } t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. Using this, we calculate \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\[\n1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.32 \\implies e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68\n\\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\n-100\\lambda = \\ln(0.68) \\implies \\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100}\n\\]\n\nApproximating \\( \\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.3857 \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.3857}{100} = 0.003857 \\, \\text{per minute}.\n\\]\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the current time, not on the time that has already passed. Thus, the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\lambda \\approx 0.003857 \\) and \\( t = 150 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\cdot 150 = 0.003857 \\cdot 150 = 0.57855\n\\]\n\n\\[\ne^{-0.57855} \\approx 0.562\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - 0.562 = 0.438 \\, \\text{or } 43.8\\%.\n\\]\n\nThe closest option to this value is **44%**, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",
