      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I need to figure out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nWait, the problem says both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, so we're dealing with special relativity here because they're moving relative to each other. But wait, the question is about distance in the galaxy's frame. So I think I need to use the concept of time dilation or length contraction, but I'm not exactly sure which one applies here.\n\nSo from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. That's a pretty high speed, so relativistic effects might be significant. Let me check, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of c. Not super high, but enough that we can't ignore relativistic effects.\n\nWait, the problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, so in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them. So in their own frame, the ejecta is stationary, and the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. But from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards them at the same speed, 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but how does time work here? If 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the galaxy's frame? Because of time dilation. So the gamma factor (Lorentz factor) comes into play here.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let's calculate that. V is 60,000 km/s. So v = 0.2c. Let's compute 1 - (0.2)^2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98. So gamma is 1 / 0.98 \u2248 1.0204. Hmm, that's not too big, but it's there.\n\nWait, but wait. The time in the galaxy's frame is longer than in the ejecta's frame. Because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slower. Or wait, no, it's the other way around. Time dilation depends on the frame. Let me get this right.\n\nIf a clock is moving relative to you, you see it as running slower. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the ejecta's clock is ticking slower. But in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving, so the galaxy's clock is ticking slower.\n\nWait, but the problem says 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find how much time passes in the galaxy's frame. Or wait, no. Because the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So the distance would be speed multiplied by time, but what's the time in the galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, because the two frames are moving relative to each other, the time experienced in each frame isn't the same. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the galaxy's frame? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this using the velocity addition formula or think about the relationship between the two frames.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think about it in terms of the distance in the galaxy's frame.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v. The time elapsed in the galaxy's frame would be the same as the proper time in their own frame, but wait, no. Let's think about the events: the start and the end of the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the concept of simultaneity. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think about how much time passes in the galaxy's frame for the same event.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. So how much time does the galaxy measure for the same event? Let me think about the relationship between time intervals.\n\nIn special relativity, the time between two events is not the same in all frames. The time in the galaxy frame (T) is related to the time in the ejecta frame (t) by the equation T = gamma (t + (v x)/c\u00b2 ), but wait, that's the formula for the time in one frame given another frame's time and position.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the Lorentz transformation. Let me recall that the Lorentz transformation for time is T = gamma (t + (v x)/c\u00b2), where x is the position in the ejecta's frame. But in this case, the event in the galaxy's frame is the passage of time, so maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at v=60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's clock is running slower. So the galaxy's time would be t' = t * gamma? Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v. So the distance would be v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame. But what is t?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it from the galaxy's perspective. Let me imagine that the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at speed v. So the ejecta's frame is moving at speed v relative to the galaxy. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, so the time it takes for the ejecta to travel a certain distance is t = distance / v.\n\nBut the question says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, the time experienced by the ejecta (t') is 50 seconds. We need to find the time that passes in the galaxy's frame (T) for the same event. Then, the distance would be v * T.\n\nWait, so how are t' and T related? Because in special relativity, the time intervals are related by time dilation. The moving clock runs slower. So from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is moving, so it runs slower.\n\nSo the relationship between the two times is T = gamma * t'.\n\nWait, no. Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the ejecta's time is dilated. So if the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the galaxy would measure a longer time. So T = gamma * t'.\n\nSo gamma is 1.0204 as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo T = 1.0204 * 50 \u2248 51.02 seconds.\n\nThen, the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v * T.\n\nv is 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.02.\n\nWait, 60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000, and 60,000 * 1.02 is 61,200. So total is approximately 3,061,200 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's close. But wait, perhaps my approximation for gamma was a bit rough.\n\nLet me compute gamma more accurately. V is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c (since c is 3e5 km/s). So v = 0.2c.\n\nGamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nWhat's sqrt(0.96)? Let me compute that. 0.96 is 96/100 = 24/25. sqrt(24/25) is sqrt(24)/5. sqrt(24) is about 4.89898. So sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 4.89898 /5 \u2248 0.9798.\n\nSo gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nSo T = 1.0206 * 50 = 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 * 51.03 = ?\n\n60,000 *50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.03 = 61,800.\n\nSo total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, close but not exact. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I got the time dilation the wrong way. Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at v. So when the ejecta measures 50 seconds, how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, time dilation works such that the moving clock runs slower. So from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is moving, so the galaxy would think that less time has passed on the ejecta's clock. No, wait, no. Wait, no, the opposite. From the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is moving, so it runs slower. So for the same event, the galaxy would see a longer time. So the time in the galaxy's frame is longer.\n\nWait, let me think of it as two events: event 1 is the start of the 50-second interval, event 2 is the end in the ejecta's frame.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, these two events happen at the same place, so the time between is 50 seconds.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame, these two events are separated by time T and position x.\n\nUsing the Lorentz transformation for time:\n\nT = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 )\n\nBut in the ejecta's frame, x' = 0, since the events are at the same position.\n\nSo T = gamma * t' = gamma * 50.\n\nSo yes, T is 50 * gamma.\n\nSo as I did earlier, T \u224851.03 s.\n\nSo the distance is v * T = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D: 3,060,000 km. But that's about 18,000 km difference. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the distance in the ejecta's frame, but no, the question says the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider length contraction instead. Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them, so the distance is contracted. But the problem is asking about the distance in the galaxy's frame, so maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, another approach: the distance in the galaxy's frame is simply the velocity multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame. So v = 60,000 km/s, time T = gamma * 50 s.\n\nSo T = (1/sqrt(1 - 0.04)) ) *50.\n\nWait, 1/sqrt(0.96) is about 1.0206, as before.\n\nSo 50 * 1.0206 \u224851.03 seconds.\n\nDistance is 60,000 *51.03 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut none of the options exactly match that. The options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB)3,000,000 km.\n\nC)2,880,000 km.\n\nD)3,060,000 km.\n\nSo D is the closest. But perhaps I should calculate more accurately.\n\nLet me compute gamma more precisely.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96).\n\nCompute sqrt(0.96) precisely.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5.\n\nsqrt(24)= 4.898979486.\n\nSo sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 0.979795897.\n\nSo gamma = 1 / 0.979795897 \u2248 1.02061655.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.02061655.\n\nSo T = 50 * 1.02061655 = 51.0308275 s.\n\nDistance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0308275 s = 60,000 *51.0308275.\n\nCalculate that:\n\n60,000 *50 =3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.0308275 = 60,000 *1 =60,000; 60,000 *0.0308275=1,849.65.\n\nSo total is 3,000,000 +60,000 +1,849.65= 3,061,849.65 km.\n\nSo about 3,061,850 km.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. The difference is about 1,850 km, which is about 0.06% error. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the relativistic effects and use a simple v*t.\n\nWait, but the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, etc., but doesn't say to ignore relativity. So the correct approach must consider relativity.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem expects you to use the classical approach, which would give 60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, that would be incorrect because we're dealing with a significant fraction of the speed of light, so relativistic effects can't be ignored.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close to our calculated 3,061,850 km.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects us to compute gamma correctly but perhaps the options are approximated. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the direction.\n\nWait, another possibility: The time in the galaxy's frame is less than in the ejecta's frame? No, that can't be right. Because the galaxy sees the ejecta moving, so their clocks are running slower. So the galaxy would measure more time passing.\n\nWait, no. If in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass, then in the galaxy's frame, more time has passed. Because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is moving and thus running slow. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the galaxy's clock would have shown more than 50 seconds. So the galaxy would measure T=gamma * t'.\n\nYes, that's what I did earlier.\n\nSo 3,061,850 km is the correct distance, but the options don't have that. The closest option is D:3,060,000 km. So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, leading to 51 s, then 60,000 *51=3,060,000 km. So that's probably what the intended answer is.\n\nWait, but why would the problem include options that are significantly different? Because sometimes in these problems, the correct approach is to use the classical formula, but that would ignore relativity. But the problem states that both are inertial frames, which suggests that relativity should be considered.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the frame of reference for the time. Let me think again.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at v. So the ejecta's frame is S', and the galaxy's frame is S.\n\nIn S', the time between events is t' = 50 s.\n\nWe need to find the distance x in S (galaxy's frame) for the same event. Wait, but what's the event? The event is the ejecta moving towards the galaxy, but how does this translate into events in each frame?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distance in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nBut the problem is that the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The proper time is the shortest time between two events, and in this case, the proper time would be in the frame where the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same place. But which frame is that?\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same position. So the proper time is 50 seconds. So the time in the galaxy's frame would be longer.\n\nSo, in the galaxy's frame, the time would be T= gamma * t =1.0206 *50 \u224851.03 s.\n\nSo the distance is v*T =60,000 *51.03 =3,061,800 km, which rounds to approximately 3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the approximation gamma=1.02, leading to 50*1.02=51 s, so 60,000*51=3,060,000, which is exactly option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the distance the supernova ejecta travels in the galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, we must account for relativistic effects due to the high relative velocity between the two frames.

Let me compute that. 0.96 is 96/100 = 24/25. sqrt(24/25) is sqrt(24)/5. sqrt(24) is about 4.89898. So sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 4.89898 /5 \u2248 0.9798.\n\nSo gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nSo T = 1.0206 * 50 = 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 * 51.03 = ?\n\n60,000 *50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.03 = 61,800.\n\nSo total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, close but not exact. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I got the time dilation the wrong way. Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at v. So when the ejecta measures 50 seconds, how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, time dilation works such that the moving clock runs slower. So from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is moving, so the galaxy would think that less time has passed on the ejecta's clock. No, wait, no. Wait, no, the opposite. From the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is moving, so it runs slower. So for the same event, the galaxy would see a longer time. So the time in the galaxy's frame is longer.\n\nWait, let me think of it as two events: event 1 is the start of the 50-second interval, event 2 is the end in the ejecta's frame.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, these two events happen at the same place, so the time between is 50 seconds.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame, these two events are separated by time T and position x.\n\nUsing the Lorentz transformation for time:\n\nT = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 )\n\nBut in the ejecta's frame, x' = 0, since the events are at the same position.\n\nSo T = gamma * t' = gamma * 50.\n\nSo yes, T is 50 * gamma.\n\nSo as I did earlier, T \u224851.03 s.\n\nSo the distance is v * T = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D: 3,060,000 km. But that's about 18,000 km difference. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the distance in the ejecta's frame, but no, the question says the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider length contraction instead. Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them, so the distance is contracted. But the problem is asking about the distance in the galaxy's frame, so maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, another approach: the distance in the galaxy's frame is simply the velocity multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame. So v = 60,000 km/s, time T = gamma * 50 s.\n\nSo T = (1/sqrt(1 - 0.04)) ) *50.\n\nWait, 1/sqrt(0.96) is about 1.0206, as before.\n\nSo 50 * 1.0206 \u224851.03 seconds.\n\nDistance is 60,000 *51.03 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut none of the options exactly match that. The options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB)3,000,000 km.\n\nC)2,880,000 km.\n\nD)3,060,000 km.\n\nSo D is the closest. But perhaps I should calculate more accurately.\n\nLet me compute gamma more precisely.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96).\n\nCompute sqrt(0.96) precisely.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5.\n\nsqrt(24)= 4.898979486.\n\nSo sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 0.979795897.\n\nSo gamma = 1 / 0.979795897 \u2248 1.02061655.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.02061655.\n\nSo T = 50 * 1.02061655 = 51.0308275 s.\n\nDistance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0308275 s = 60,000 *51.0308275.\n\nCalculate that:\n\n60,000 *50 =3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.0308275 = 60,000 *1 =60,000; 60,000 *0.0308275=1,849.65.\n\nSo total is 3,000,000 +60,000 +1,849.65= 3,061,849.65 km.\n\nSo about 3,061,850 km.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. The difference is about 1,850 km, which is about 0.06% error. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the relativistic effects and use a simple v*t.\n\nWait, but the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, etc., but doesn't say to ignore relativity. So the correct approach must consider relativity.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem expects you to use the classical approach, which would give 60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, that would be incorrect because we're dealing with a significant fraction of the speed of light, so relativistic effects can't be ignored.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close to our calculated 3,061,850 km.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects us to compute gamma correctly but perhaps the options are approximated. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the direction.\n\nWait, another possibility: The time in the galaxy's frame is less than in the ejecta's frame? No, that can't be right. Because the galaxy sees the ejecta moving, so their clocks are running slower. So the galaxy would measure more time passing.\n\nWait, no. If in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass, then in the galaxy's frame, more time has passed. Because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is moving and thus running slow. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the galaxy's clock would have shown more than 50 seconds. So the galaxy would measure T=gamma * t'.\n\nYes, that's what I did earlier.\n\nSo 3,061,850 km is the correct distance, but the options don't have that. The closest option is D:3,060,000 km. So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, leading to 51 s, then 60,000 *51=3,060,000 km. So that's probably what the intended answer is.\n\nWait, but why would the problem include options that are significantly different? Because sometimes in these problems, the correct approach is to use the classical formula, but that would ignore relativity. But the problem states that both are inertial frames, which suggests that relativity should be considered.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the frame of reference for the time. Let me think again.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at v. So the ejecta's frame is S', and the galaxy's frame is S.\n\nIn S', the time between events is t' = 50 s.\n\nWe need to find the distance x in S (galaxy's frame) for the same event. Wait, but what's the event? The event is the ejecta moving towards the galaxy, but how does this translate into events in each frame?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distance in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nBut the problem is that the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The proper time is the shortest time between two events, and in this case, the proper time would be in the frame where the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same place. But which frame is that?\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same position. So the proper time is 50 seconds. So the time in the galaxy's frame would be longer.\n\nSo, in the galaxy's frame, the time would be T= gamma * t =1.0206 *50 \u224851.03 s.\n\nSo the distance is v*T =60,000 *51.03 =3,061,800 km, which rounds to approximately 3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the approximation gamma=1.02, leading to 50*1.02=51 s, so 60,000*51=3,060,000, which is exactly option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\n\nTo determine the distance the supernova ejecta travels in the galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, we must account for relativistic effects due to the high relative velocity between the two frames. The ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames, and the ejecta is moving at a speed of \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) (or \\( 0.2c \\)) relative to the galaxy.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relating Time Intervals Between Frames**:  \n   In special relativity, the time dilation formula relates the time intervals measured in two inertial frames:\n   \\[\n   T = \\gamma t',\n   \\]\n   where \\( T \\) is the time in the galaxy's frame, \\( t' \\) is the time in the ejecta's frame, and \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor:\n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( v = 0.2c \\), we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:  \n   Given \\( t' = 50 \\, \\text{s} \\) in the ejecta's frame, the time in the galaxy's frame is:\n   \\[\n   T = \\gamma t' = 1.0206 \\times 50 \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  \n   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the galaxy's frame is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = v \\cdot T = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\cdot 51.03 \\, \\text{s} \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Comparison with Options**:  \n   The calculated distance (\\( \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km} \\)) is closest to option \\( D \\), which is \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer, accounting for relativistic time dilation and the given options, is:\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think through this.\n\nThe problem says that both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, no, actually, the ejecta part is moving towards the galaxy's center. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. But from the ejecta's perspective, the galaxy is moving towards it at that speed.\n\nWait, no, no. The question says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the ejecta's point of view, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. But in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s. So they're moving towards each other. That makes sense.\n\nThe question is about how much distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, so we need to relate the time experienced in each frame.\n\nWait, I remember that time dilation comes into play when there are different inertial frames. But wait, the problem states that both are inertial frames, so we can use the Lorentz transformations here.\n\nSo, the time experienced in one frame is related to the other by the Lorentz factor gamma. But wait, how does that work when both are moving relative to each other? Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, and in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, given the time in the ejecta's frame. So I need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame, which is (velocity of ejecta) * (time in galaxy's frame). But the time given is in the ejecta's frame, so I need to find out how much time passes in the galaxy's frame when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds.\n\nWait, but the time in the galaxy's frame would be longer because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is moving and thus runs slower. Wait, no, actually, time dilation depends on the relative motion. So which frame is which?\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the galaxy's frame is moving at v = 60,000 km/s relative to the ejecta. So from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy.\n\nBut the problem is about time in the ejecta's frame. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, let me think about this. If I have two inertial frames, S (galaxy) and S' (ejecta), moving at velocity v relative to each other.\n\nIn S', the time is t', and in S it's t.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for time is t = gamma (t' + (v x') / c\u00b2 ). But in this case, the event is the passage of time in the ejecta frame. So the event is happening at the same location in the ejecta's frame. So x' is zero because the event is at the origin of S', right? Because the ejecta's frame is the rest frame, and the event is the time passing there.\n\nSo x' = 0, so t = gamma * t'. So t = gamma * t'.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). But wait, v here is 60,000 km/s. Let me compute that in terms of c.\n\nWait, the speed of light c is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2c. So v = 0.2c.\n\nSo gamma would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' \u2192 t = 1.0206 * 50 s \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check: when S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then in S, the time for an event at the same place in S' is t = gamma t'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo in the galaxy's frame, the time that has passed is approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nBut the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame. So the distance it travels in the galaxy's frame is velocity multiplied by time.\n\nSo distance = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 *50=3,000,000 plus 60,000 *1.03=61,800. So total 3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm, 3,061,800 is close to option D, which is 3,060,000. But perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nLet me compute gamma more precisely.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.04.\n\nSo 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = 0.9798 approximately. So 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206, as before.\n\nSo t = 1.0206 * 50 = 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 *51 =3,060,000, plus 60,000 *0.03=1,800 \u2192 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have 3,061,800. The closest is D) 3,060,000. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore time dilation, treating the frames as Newtonian, which would give distance as 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km. That would be option B.\n\nWait, but the question says both are inertial frames, which suggests that we should consider relativity. So which approach is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I've made a mistake in the direction. Let me think again: in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the relative velocity between the two frames is 60,000 km/s.\n\nBut in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy.\n\nThe problem says, when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame, how much distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, perhaps the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. So the ejecta is moving for more than 50 seconds in the galaxy's frame, so the distance is greater than 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 * (50 * gamma). Which would be 60,000 * (50 * 1.0206) = 60,000 *51.03=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut none of the options match that exactly. The closest is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to use an approximation for gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96). Let's see: 0.96 is 24^2 /25^2, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, sqrt(0.96) = 0.979795897.\n\nSo gamma is 1 / 0.979795897 \u2248 1.02062368.\n\nSo 50 * 1.02062368 = 51.031184 seconds.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 *51.031184 = let's compute 60,000 *51 =3,060,000, plus 60,000 *0.031184= 60,000 *0.03=1,800; 60,000 *0.001184=71.04. So total 1,800 +71.04=1,871.04. So total distance 3,060,000 + 1,871.04=3,061,871 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. Hmm. Maybe the problem expects me to use a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the classical approach, not considering relativity. So the time in the galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame, which is 50 seconds. So distance would be 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, option B.\n\nBut the problem says both are inertial frames, so relativity should apply. So perhaps the correct approach is to use time dilation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the fact that from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the time experienced by the ejecta's clock is less than the galaxy's time. So when the galaxy's clock shows t, the ejecta's shows t' = t / gamma.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again. The galaxy's frame is S, and the ejecta is S'. So in S (galaxy), the ejecta is moving at velocity v. So the proper time in S' is the time experienced by the ejecta.\n\nWait, proper time is the time measured in the moving frame. So if t is the time in S (galaxy), then t' = t / gamma.\n\nWait, no, the correct formula is t' = gamma (t - (v x)/c\u00b2 ). But in this case, x is the position where the event occurs. But in our case, the event is the passage of time in the ejecta's frame. So in S', the event is at x' =0, and the time is t' =50 s.\n\nSo in S, the time t is given by t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 ). But x' is zero, so t = gamma t'.\n\nSo t = gamma *50 s.\n\nWait, so the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, so the ejecta would have been moving for more time, hence covering more distance.\n\nSo the distance is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 * gamma.\n\nWait, but wait, no. The velocity is 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves at 60,000 km/s for t seconds, which is gamma *50 seconds.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 * gamma *50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that gamma was about 1.0206, so 50 * gamma is about 51.03, so 60,000 *51.03=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D is 3,060,000 km. That's 60,000 *51 =3,060,000.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses an approximate value of gamma. Let me compute gamma again.\n\nv =0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nCalculating sqrt(0.96):\n\nWe can write 0.96 = (48/50)^2 = (24/25)^2. Hmm, wait 24^2=576, 25^2=625, 576/625=0.9216. No, that's not 0.96. Alternatively, 0.96 is (0.98)^2? Let's see: 0.98^2=0.9604. Oh, that's very close to 0.96.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.9798 (as earlier), so gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, which would make 50 *1.02=51, so 60,000 *51=3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't consider time dilation and just uses the given 50 seconds, leading to 3,000,000 km (option B). But I think that would be incorrect because the problem states that both are inertial frames, implying that relativity applies.\n\nWait, but wait. Maybe I'm getting the direction wrong. Let me think: in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s. So in that frame, the ejecta's velocity is v=60,000 km/s towards the galaxy. So the time in the galaxy's frame is t, and the ejecta's time is t' = t / gamma.\n\nBut the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. So t' =50 s.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' \u2192 t= gamma *50.\n\nSo the ejecta has been moving for gamma *50 seconds in the galaxy's frame, so the distance is v * t = 60,000 * gamma *50.\n\nSo 60,000 *50=3,000,000. Then multiply by gamma (\u22481.0206) \u2192 3,000,000 *1.0206 \u22483,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, which gives 3,000,000 *1.02=3,060,000 km, option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s, and the time is 50 seconds. So the distance the galaxy moves towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km.\n\nBut wait, that's the distance the galaxy moves in the ejecta's frame. But the question asks how much the ejecta has moved in the galaxy's frame. So that's different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering relative velocity but not time dilation, treating it as a classical problem. So the time in the galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame, leading to 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, option B. But that would be ignoring relativity, which might not be correct given the problem statement.\n\nWait, but the problem says both are inertial frames, so relativity applies. So the correct approach is to use Lorentz transformations, leading to option D.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is D) 3,060,000 km.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the relative motion between the supernova ejecta and the Galaxy, considering the principles of special relativity.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think through this.\n\nThe problem says that both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, no, actually, the ejecta part is moving towards the galaxy's center. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. But from the ejecta's perspective, the galaxy is moving towards it at that speed.\n\nWait, no, no. The question says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the ejecta's point of view, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. But in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s. So they're moving towards each other. That makes sense.\n\nThe question is about how much distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, so we need to relate the time experienced in each frame.\n\nWait, I remember that time dilation comes into play when there are different inertial frames. But wait, the problem states that both are inertial frames, so we can use the Lorentz transformations here.\n\nSo, the time experienced in one frame is related to the other by the Lorentz factor gamma. But wait, how does that work when both are moving relative to each other? Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, and in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, given the time in the ejecta's frame. So I need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame, which is (velocity of ejecta) * (time in galaxy's frame). But the time given is in the ejecta's frame, so I need to find out how much time passes in the galaxy's frame when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds.\n\nWait, but the time in the galaxy's frame would be longer because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is moving and thus runs slower. Wait, no, actually, time dilation depends on the relative motion. So which frame is which?\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the galaxy's frame is moving at v = 60,000 km/s relative to the ejecta. So from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy.\n\nBut the problem is about time in the ejecta's frame. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, let me think about this. If I have two inertial frames, S (galaxy) and S' (ejecta), moving at velocity v relative to each other.\n\nIn S', the time is t', and in S it's t.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for time is t = gamma (t' + (v x') / c\u00b2 ). But in this case, the event is the passage of time in the ejecta frame. So the event is happening at the same location in the ejecta's frame. So x' is zero because the event is at the origin of S', right? Because the ejecta's frame is the rest frame, and the event is the time passing there.\n\nSo x' = 0, so t = gamma * t'. So t = gamma * t'.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). But wait, v here is 60,000 km/s. Let me compute that in terms of c.\n\nWait, the speed of light c is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2c. So v = 0.2c.\n\nSo gamma would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' \u2192 t = 1.0206 * 50 s \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check: when S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then in S, the time for an event at the same place in S' is t = gamma t'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo in the galaxy's frame, the time that has passed is approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nBut the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame. So the distance it travels in the galaxy's frame is velocity multiplied by time.\n\nSo distance = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 *50=3,000,000 plus 60,000 *1.03=61,800. So total 3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm, 3,061,800 is close to option D, which is 3,060,000. But perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nLet me compute gamma more precisely.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.04.\n\nSo 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = 0.9798 approximately. So 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206, as before.\n\nSo t = 1.0206 * 50 = 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 *51 =3,060,000, plus 60,000 *0.03=1,800 \u2192 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have 3,061,800. The closest is D) 3,060,000. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore time dilation, treating the frames as Newtonian, which would give distance as 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km. That would be option B.\n\nWait, but the question says both are inertial frames, which suggests that we should consider relativity. So which approach is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I've made a mistake in the direction. Let me think again: in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the relative velocity between the two frames is 60,000 km/s.\n\nBut in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy.\n\nThe problem says, when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame, how much distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, perhaps the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. So the ejecta is moving for more than 50 seconds in the galaxy's frame, so the distance is greater than 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 * (50 * gamma). Which would be 60,000 * (50 * 1.0206) = 60,000 *51.03=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut none of the options match that exactly. The closest is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to use an approximation for gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96). Let's see: 0.96 is 24^2 /25^2, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, sqrt(0.96) = 0.979795897.\n\nSo gamma is 1 / 0.979795897 \u2248 1.02062368.\n\nSo 50 * 1.02062368 = 51.031184 seconds.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 *51.031184 = let's compute 60,000 *51 =3,060,000, plus 60,000 *0.031184= 60,000 *0.03=1,800; 60,000 *0.001184=71.04. So total 1,800 +71.04=1,871.04. So total distance 3,060,000 + 1,871.04=3,061,871 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. Hmm. Maybe the problem expects me to use a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the classical approach, not considering relativity. So the time in the galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame, which is 50 seconds. So distance would be 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, option B.\n\nBut the problem says both are inertial frames, so relativity should apply. So perhaps the correct approach is to use time dilation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the fact that from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the time experienced by the ejecta's clock is less than the galaxy's time. So when the galaxy's clock shows t, the ejecta's shows t' = t / gamma.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again. The galaxy's frame is S, and the ejecta is S'. So in S (galaxy), the ejecta is moving at velocity v. So the proper time in S' is the time experienced by the ejecta.\n\nWait, proper time is the time measured in the moving frame. So if t is the time in S (galaxy), then t' = t / gamma.\n\nWait, no, the correct formula is t' = gamma (t - (v x)/c\u00b2 ). But in this case, x is the position where the event occurs. But in our case, the event is the passage of time in the ejecta's frame. So in S', the event is at x' =0, and the time is t' =50 s.\n\nSo in S, the time t is given by t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 ). But x' is zero, so t = gamma t'.\n\nSo t = gamma *50 s.\n\nWait, so the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, so the ejecta would have been moving for more time, hence covering more distance.\n\nSo the distance is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 * gamma.\n\nWait, but wait, no. The velocity is 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves at 60,000 km/s for t seconds, which is gamma *50 seconds.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 * gamma *50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that gamma was about 1.0206, so 50 * gamma is about 51.03, so 60,000 *51.03=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D is 3,060,000 km. That's 60,000 *51 =3,060,000.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses an approximate value of gamma. Let me compute gamma again.\n\nv =0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nCalculating sqrt(0.96):\n\nWe can write 0.96 = (48/50)^2 = (24/25)^2. Hmm, wait 24^2=576, 25^2=625, 576/625=0.9216. No, that's not 0.96. Alternatively, 0.96 is (0.98)^2? Let's see: 0.98^2=0.9604. Oh, that's very close to 0.96.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.9798 (as earlier), so gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, which would make 50 *1.02=51, so 60,000 *51=3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't consider time dilation and just uses the given 50 seconds, leading to 3,000,000 km (option B). But I think that would be incorrect because the problem states that both are inertial frames, implying that relativity applies.\n\nWait, but wait. Maybe I'm getting the direction wrong. Let me think: in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s. So in that frame, the ejecta's velocity is v=60,000 km/s towards the galaxy. So the time in the galaxy's frame is t, and the ejecta's time is t' = t / gamma.\n\nBut the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. So t' =50 s.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' \u2192 t= gamma *50.\n\nSo the ejecta has been moving for gamma *50 seconds in the galaxy's frame, so the distance is v * t = 60,000 * gamma *50.\n\nSo 60,000 *50=3,000,000. Then multiply by gamma (\u22481.0206) \u2192 3,000,000 *1.0206 \u22483,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, which gives 3,000,000 *1.02=3,060,000 km, option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s, and the time is 50 seconds. So the distance the galaxy moves towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km.\n\nBut wait, that's the distance the galaxy moves in the ejecta's frame. But the question asks how much the ejecta has moved in the galaxy's frame. So that's different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering relative velocity but not time dilation, treating it as a classical problem. So the time in the galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame, leading to 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, option B. But that would be ignoring relativity, which might not be correct given the problem statement.\n\nWait, but the problem says both are inertial frames, so relativity applies. So the correct approach is to use Lorentz transformations, leading to option D.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the relative motion between the supernova ejecta and the Galaxy, considering the principles of special relativity. The ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference, and the relative velocity between them is \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), which is \\( 0.2c \\) (where \\( c \\) is the speed of light).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, I need to figure out the distance the ejecta travels from the galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Let me try to break this down.\n\nWait, the problem says that the ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames. So I guess I can use special relativity here. Oh right, because when dealing with speeds a significant fraction of the speed of light, I can't ignore relativistic effects. But wait, the problem gives a speed of 60,000 km/s. Let me calculate what that is in terms of the speed of light.\n\nThe speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2 times c, right? Because 300,000 divided by 60,000 is 5. Wait no, 60,000 is 20% of 300,000. So 0.2c. That's 20% the speed of light. So relativistic effects might be noticeable, but maybe not too bad.\n\nThe problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy (the center) at the same speed, right? Because velocities are relative. Wait, no, not exactly. Because when you switch frames, you have to use the velocity addition formula. Wait, but in this case, both are inertial frames, so it's a straightforward switch.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. If the galaxy is at rest, and the ejecta is moving towards it at v, then in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy would be moving towards them at v as well. Because in Galilean relativity, velocities just add. But in reality, using special relativity, the situation is a bit more complex. But the problem says that in the ejecta frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy. So the two frames are moving at velocity v relative to each other. So v is 0.2c.\n\nNow, the question is, how much distance does the ejecta cover in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, the time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, and we need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame. So we need to find the proper distance or something else.\n\nWait, time dilation comes into play here. Because the two frames are moving relative to each other, so time intervals will differ. So in the galaxy's frame, the time experienced by the ejecta (which is moving relative to the galaxy) would be longer due to time dilation.\n\nLet me recall the time dilation formula: t = gamma * t0, where t is the time in the stationary frame (galaxy), and t0 is the proper time (ejecta's frame).\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So let's compute gamma first.\n\nv is 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that to m/s for calculation, but perhaps it's easier to work in fractions of c.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\nSo gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.98 \u2248 1.0204. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. Hmm, so gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nSo the time in the galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t0. t0 is 50 seconds. So t = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nBut wait, that's the time in the galaxy's frame. Now, the distance the ejecta travels is velocity multiplied by time. Velocity is 60,000 km/s, time is approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, so distance is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 km.\n\nWait, 60,000 times 50 is 3,000,000, and 60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800. So total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Close enough, considering rounding. But wait, let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = approximately 1.0206236.\n\nSo t = 50 * 1.0206236 \u2248 51.03118 seconds.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.03118 s = 60,000 *51.03118 km.\n\nCalculating 60,000 *51 =3,060,000 km, and 60,000 *0.03118 \u2248 1,870.8 km. So total is approximately 3,061,870.8 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is the closest.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Let me recheck the formula. Because in the ejecta's frame, the time experienced is 50 seconds. So in the galaxy's frame, the time is longer. So the time is t = gamma * t0, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the velocity is 60,000 km/s. Let me make sure about the units. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s, and 50 seconds is 5e1 s. So 6e4 * 5e1 = 3e6 km, but that's without considering time dilation. But since the time is longer, we have to multiply by gamma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the classical approach, but that would give 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But the problem says both are inertial frames, which suggests we should use special relativity.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the question is phrased a bit differently. It says, what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nSo the proper time is 50 seconds. The galaxy's frame will see the time as longer. So the distance is v multiplied by the dilated time.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think in terms of length contraction. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the velocity and the proper time.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at v. So the time experienced is 50 seconds. The distance the galaxy would cover in that time is v * t0. But in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v, and the time is longer.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame:\n\n- The galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s.\n- Time elapsed is 50 seconds.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame:\n\n- The ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s.\n- The time elapsed is longer due to time dilation.\n\nSo, the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the dilated time.\n\nSo let's compute gamma first.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.020623.\n\nt_galaxy = gamma * t_ejecta = 50 * 1.020623 \u224851.03115 seconds.\n\ndistance = v * t_galaxy = 60,000 km/s *51.03115 s \u2248 3,061,869 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would yield that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute gamma more precisely.\n\nCalculating gamma:\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\nv^2/c^2 = 0.04.\n\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.9798 (since 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is a bit higher than 0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nWe can approximate sqrt(0.96):\n\n0.98^2 = 0.9604. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1/sqrt(0.96) is approximately 1.020623.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020623.\n\nSo t_galaxy = 50 * 1.020623 \u224851.03115 seconds.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 *51.03115 = 60,000 *51.03115.\n\n51.03115 *60,000 = let's compute 51 *60,000 =3,060,000, and 0.03115 *60,000=1,869.\n\nSo total is 3,061,869 km. The options don't have that exact number. The closest is option D:3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem expects to ignore time dilation and use classical mechanics. Then, the time in the galaxy's frame would be the same as the ejecta's frame. So 60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km, which is option B. But the problem states that both are inertial frames, so relativity should apply.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Another approach is to find the distance in the ejecta's frame, then apply length contraction.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them. The distance the galaxy would cover is v * t0 =60,000 km/s *50 s=3,000,000 km. But in the galaxy's frame, the distance is contracted. Wait, no, length contraction applies to objects at rest in the other frame.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving, so the distance between the ejecta and the galaxy (if the galaxy is at rest) would be length L. But I'm not sure this approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the distance in the galaxy's frame as v multiplied by the proper time, but that's not correct. Because proper time is the shortest time experienced by the moving object. So the time in the galaxy's frame is longer.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the distance in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by t_galaxy.\n\nt_galaxy is t0 * gamma.\n\nSo yes, the calculation I did earlier holds.\n\nSo the distance is 3,061,869 km, which is approximately 3,060,000 km, option D.\n\nWait, but why is the answer not exactly 3,060,000? Let me compute the exact value:\n\ngamma = 1/sqrt(0.96) = 1/(0.9798) \u22481.020623.\n\nt =50 * 1.020623 =51.03115 s.\n\ndistance =60,000 *51.03115 =60,000*(51 +0.03115) =60,000*51 +60,000*0.03115=3,060,000 + 1,869=3,061,869 km.\n\nWhich is approximately 3,061,869 km, but the options don't have that. The closest is D)3,060,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the approximation gamma \u22481 + (v^2)/(2c^2). Let me try that.\n\nGamma \u22481 + (v\u00b2)/(2c\u00b2). Since v=0.2c,\n\nv\u00b2 =0.04 c\u00b2.\n\nSo gamma \u22481 +0.04/(2) =1 +0.02=1.02.\n\nSo t_galaxy =50 *1.02=51 s.\n\ndistance=60,000 *51=3,060,000 km.\n\nWhich matches option D exactly. So perhaps the problem expects us to use this approximation, which is the Taylor expansion of gamma for small v/c. Since 0.2c is 60,000 km/s, which is a significant fraction, but maybe the question expects the approximate method.\n\nSo the correct answer would be D)3,060,000 km.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, I need to figure out the distance the ejecta travels from the galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Let me try to break this down.\n\nWait, the problem says that the ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames. So I guess I can use special relativity here. Oh right, because when dealing with speeds a significant fraction of the speed of light, I can't ignore relativistic effects. But wait, the problem gives a speed of 60,000 km/s. Let me calculate what that is in terms of the speed of light.\n\nThe speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2 times c, right? Because 300,000 divided by 60,000 is 5. Wait no, 60,000 is 20% of 300,000. So 0.2c. That's 20% the speed of light. So relativistic effects might be noticeable, but maybe not too bad.\n\nThe problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy (the center) at the same speed, right? Because velocities are relative. Wait, no, not exactly. Because when you switch frames, you have to use the velocity addition formula. Wait, but in this case, both are inertial frames, so it's a straightforward switch.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. If the galaxy is at rest, and the ejecta is moving towards it at v, then in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy would be moving towards them at v as well. Because in Galilean relativity, velocities just add. But in reality, using special relativity, the situation is a bit more complex. But the problem says that in the ejecta frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy. So the two frames are moving at velocity v relative to each other. So v is 0.2c.\n\nNow, the question is, how much distance does the ejecta cover in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, the time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, and we need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame. So we need to find the proper distance or something else.\n\nWait, time dilation comes into play here. Because the two frames are moving relative to each other, so time intervals will differ. So in the galaxy's frame, the time experienced by the ejecta (which is moving relative to the galaxy) would be longer due to time dilation.\n\nLet me recall the time dilation formula: t = gamma * t0, where t is the time in the stationary frame (galaxy), and t0 is the proper time (ejecta's frame).\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So let's compute gamma first.\n\nv is 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that to m/s for calculation, but perhaps it's easier to work in fractions of c.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\nSo gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.98 \u2248 1.0204. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. Hmm, so gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nSo the time in the galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t0. t0 is 50 seconds. So t = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nBut wait, that's the time in the galaxy's frame. Now, the distance the ejecta travels is velocity multiplied by time. Velocity is 60,000 km/s, time is approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, so distance is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 km.\n\nWait, 60,000 times 50 is 3,000,000, and 60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800. So total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Close enough, considering rounding. But wait, let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = approximately 1.0206236.\n\nSo t = 50 * 1.0206236 \u2248 51.03118 seconds.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.03118 s = 60,000 *51.03118 km.\n\nCalculating 60,000 *51 =3,060,000 km, and 60,000 *0.03118 \u2248 1,870.8 km. So total is approximately 3,061,870.8 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is the closest.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Let me recheck the formula. Because in the ejecta's frame, the time experienced is 50 seconds. So in the galaxy's frame, the time is longer. So the time is t = gamma * t0, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the velocity is 60,000 km/s. Let me make sure about the units. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s, and 50 seconds is 5e1 s. So 6e4 * 5e1 = 3e6 km, but that's without considering time dilation. But since the time is longer, we have to multiply by gamma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the classical approach, but that would give 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But the problem says both are inertial frames, which suggests we should use special relativity.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the question is phrased a bit differently. It says, what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nSo the proper time is 50 seconds. The galaxy's frame will see the time as longer. So the distance is v multiplied by the dilated time.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think in terms of length contraction. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the velocity and the proper time.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at v. So the time experienced is 50 seconds. The distance the galaxy would cover in that time is v * t0. But in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v, and the time is longer.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.

So 1/sqrt(0.96) is approximately 1.020623.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020623.\n\nSo t_galaxy = 50 * 1.020623 \u224851.03115 seconds.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 *51.03115 = 60,000 *51.03115.\n\n51.03115 *60,000 = let's compute 51 *60,000 =3,060,000, and 0.03115 *60,000=1,869.\n\nSo total is 3,061,869 km.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.\n\nThe question is about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, which I remember means no acceleration involved. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The problem is asking how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame after 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.\n\nHmm. Wait, wait. So time is measured differently in different frames. Oh right, time dilation comes into play here because of special relativity when frames are moving relative to each other. So I think I need to use the Lorentz factor here.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me break it down. The key here is to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that's 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nSo, the two frames are the ejecta (let's say frame S') and the Galaxy (frame S). The Galaxy is moving at velocity v relative to the ejecta. Wait, no, wait. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s. That means in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at the same speed, 60,000 km/s. Because velocities reverse when you switch frames, but the speed is the same in magnitude.\n\nSo, the speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is v = 60,000 km/s. But wait, wait\u2014hold on. Let me clarify: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the ejecta is at rest in its own frame, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at the same speed, 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, we have to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that's 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nBut time in the two frames isn't the same. Because of time dilation, the time experienced in one frame is different from the other. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, but wait again. The time measured in each frame depends on whose perspective we're considering. Since the events are the start and end of the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, we need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the velocity and the time each frame experiences. But I'm getting a bit stuck.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the formula for time dilation. Time dilation formula is T = gamma * t, where T is the time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy's frame), and t is the proper time (ejecta's frame). Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo here, t is 50 seconds. So T = gamma * 50.\n\nWait, but wait. Which frame is moving relative to which? The Galaxy is moving at v = 60,000 km/s relative to the ejecta. So the ejecta's frame is the rest frame, and the Galaxy's frame is moving at v relative to the ejecta. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than the ejecta's time. So T = gamma * t.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I get the direction right. The ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy. So from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at v. So in the Galaxy's frame, the time experienced is longer. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the Galaxy's clock shows more than 50 seconds.\n\nWait no, wait: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So the Galaxy's frame is the moving one relative to the ejecta. So when calculating time in the Galaxy's frame, we need to use the time dilation formula. Hmm, but I'm getting confused about which frame is which.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the velocity and the time in each frame to calculate the distance. Wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, and the time is T. So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is distance = v * T.\n\nBut I don't know T yet. Because T is the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is longer than the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nSo how do I find T?\n\nUsing time dilation: T = gamma * t, where t is the proper time (the time in the ejecta's frame). Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nBut wait, let's calculate gamma. v is 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that to m/s for easier calculations, but wait, maybe it's easier in km/s. Let me think: the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So v is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c (since 0.2 * 300,000 is 60,000). So v = 0.2c.\n\nSo gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.98 \u2248 1.0196.\n\nWait, wait, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0205. Hmm, let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCalculating sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me compute 0.96^(1/2). Let's see: 0.96 is 96/100. Let me see, 0.98^2 is 0.9604, so sqrt(0.96) is a bit less than 0.98. Wait, 0.98^2 = (1 - 0.02)^2 = 1 - 0.04 + 0.0004 = 0.9604. So 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is 0.0004 higher than 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is a bit less than 0.98. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, let me just compute it numerically:\n\nsqrt(0.96) = approximately 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0205.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.0205.\n\nSo T = gamma * t = 1.0205 * 50 seconds \u2248 51.025 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait, this can't be right because 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is a significant fraction but not extremely relativistic, so the time dilation isn't huge. So the time in the Galaxy frame is 50 * gamma, which is about 50 * 1.0205 \u2248 51.025 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is the proper time t the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, or is it the other way around?\n\nProper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end of the 50-second interval) happen at the same place. So if the ejecta is at rest in its own frame, then the start and end of the 50 seconds happen at the same place in the ejecta's frame, making t the proper time. So yes, t is 50 seconds, and T is gamma * t.\n\nSo in the Galaxy frame, the time that passes is about 51.025 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait, that's a very small effect. Let me check my calculation again.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s.\n\nc = 3e5 km/s.\n\nSo v/c = 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2.\n\nSo gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo T \u2248 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo in the Galaxy's frame, the time that has passed is approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nBut wait, the question is about how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during this time. So the distance is velocity multiplied by time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, velocity is v = 60,000 km/s, and time is T \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, that's close. But let me double-check the calculations for gamma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 0.96 = 0.96.\n\nLet me find the square root. Let me use the Taylor expansion or iterative method.\n\nLet me approximate sqrt(0.96). Let me consider x = 0.96.\n\nWe know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604, which is just a bit over 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is 0.98 - delta, where delta is small.\n\nLet me compute (0.98 - delta)^2 = 0.96.\n\nExpanding (0.98 - delta)^2 = 0.9604 - 1.96 delta + delta^2 = 0.96.\n\nAssuming delta is small, delta^2 is negligible.\n\nSo 0.9604 - 1.96 delta \u2248 0.96.\n\nSo 0.9604 - 0.96 = 1.96 delta.\n\n0.0004 = 1.96 delta \u2192 delta \u2248 0.0004 / 1.96 \u2248 0.00020408.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.98 - 0.00020408 \u2248 0.97979592.\n\nSo 1 / 0.97979592 \u2248 1.020506.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.020506.\n\nSo T = 50 * 1.020506 \u2248 51.0253 seconds.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0253 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.0253.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 * 1.0253 = 61,518.\n\nSo total is 3,000,000 + 61,518 = 3,061,518 km.\n\nHmm, the options don't have this exact number. Let's look at the options again.\n\nOption D: 3,060,000 km.\n\nOption C: 2,880,000 km.\n\nOption A: 2,940,000 km.\n\nOption B: 3,000,000 km.\n\nSo 3,061,518 is closest to option D, but it's not exactly matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering which frame's time to use. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s, so the ejecta's speed relative to the Galaxy is v = 60,000 km/s. So the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at that speed.\n\nWait, but when considering the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, that's just v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. So yes, the time is T = gamma * t, where t is the time in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should calculate it using length contraction instead. Or maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the approximation that the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by T. But perhaps I should compute the exact gamma and see.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute gamma more precisely. Let's compute gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96).\n\nCalculating sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) using more precise methods.\n\nLet me compute it numerically:\n\nI can use the Newton-Raphson method to find the square root of 0.96.\n\nLet me take an initial guess of x0 = 0.98.\n\nx1 = (x0 + 0.96/x0)/2.\n\nCompute x1: (0.98 + 0.96/0.98)/2.\n\n0.96 / 0.98 \u2248 0.9795918.\n\nSo x1 = (0.98 + 0.9795918)/2 = (1.9595918)/2 \u2248 0.9797959.\n\nNow compute x2 = (x1 + 0.96/x1)/2.\n\n0.96 / 0.9797959 \u2248 0.980392156.\n\nx2 = (0.9797959 + 0.980392156)/2 \u2248 (1.959188056)/2 \u2248 0.979594028.\n\nx3 = (0.979594028 + 0.96/0.979594028)/2.\n\n0.96 / 0.979594028 \u2248 0.980392156.\n\nSo x3 = (0.979594028 + 0.980392156)/2 \u2248 (1.959986184)/2 \u2248 0.979993092.\n\nx4 = (0.979993092 + 0.96 / 0.979993092)/2.\n\n0.96 / 0.979993092 \u2248 0.98000309.\n\nx4 = (0.979993092 + 0.98000309)/2 \u2248 (1.96)/2 = 0.98.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 0.98 squared is 0.9604, which is larger than 0.96. Hmm, perhaps the approximation is converging to 0.9798 or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just use a calculator's approximation.\n\nsqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.9797958971.\n\nSo gamma = 1 / 0.9797958971 \u2248 1.020605.\n\nSo T = 50 * 1.020605 \u2248 51.03025 seconds.\n\nSo distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03025 s = 60,000 * 51.03025.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n50 * 60,000 = 3,000,000.\n\n1.03025 * 60,000 = 61,815.\n\nTotal distance \u2248 3,061,815 km.\n\nLooking at the options again, the closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. But perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. Perhaps the problem is simpler, and I'm overcomplicating it by considering time dilation. Maybe the problem expects me to ignore relativistic effects, treating it as a classical mechanics problem. But the question specifies that both are inertial frames, and since the speed is a significant fraction of c (20% the speed of light), we can't ignore relativity.\n\nWait, another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. So in that frame, the time is t =50 seconds. So the distance the Galaxy travels in the ejecta's frame is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But that's the distance the Galaxy moves towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame. But the question is about the ejecta's movement in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased: \"what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nSo, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s towards the center. So in Galaxy's frame, the time is longer due to time dilation. So the distance the ejecta moves is v multiplied by T, where T is the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nBut earlier calculation gives T \u224851.03 seconds, so distance is 60,000 * 51.03 \u22483,061,800 km. But that's not exactly matching any option, except D is 3,060,000 km, which is close but not exact.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the approximation gamma \u22481, which would make T \u224850 seconds. Then the distance would be 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that can't be right because 60,000 km/s is 20% the speed of light, and gamma would be about 1.02, so the time would be 50*1.02=51 seconds, leading to a distance of about 3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate gamma exactly.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(1/0.96) = sqrt(25/24) \u22481.02060455.\n\nSo T = 50 * 1.02060455 \u224851.0302275 seconds.\n\nSo distance = 60,000 *51.0302275 \u22483,061,813.65 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the time dilation and just multiply v * t. But that would give 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would be incorrect because the time experienced is longer in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, more time passes. So the distance the ejecta moves is v multiplied by the dilated time.\n\nSo the correct calculation would be 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u22483,061,800 km, which is approximately option D, 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem expects us to compute using the inverse of gamma. Let me think again. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v. So perhaps the proper time is the time in the ejecta's frame, and the Galaxy's time is longer. So T = gamma * t.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the distance as v multiplied by T, where T is the time in the Galaxy's frame. So yes, that's what I did earlier.\n\nSo the answer should be approximately 3,061,800 km, but the closest option is D, 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses an approximate value for gamma. Let me compute gamma to three decimal places.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.02060455.\n\nSo T = 50 * 1.02060455 \u224851.0302275.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 *51.0302275 = 3,061,813.65 km.\n\nHmm, that's about 3,061,814 km. None of the options exactly match that, but option D is 3,060,000 km. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use a more precise value of gamma, but perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the distance in the ejecta's frame, not the Galaxy's frame. Wait, no, the question is about the distance in the Galaxy's frame. So no, that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v, so the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at v in the Galaxy's frame. So the distance it travels is v multiplied by T. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the time in the ejecta's frame is longer. Wait, that can't be right because the ejecta's frame is the proper frame for the event (start and end at same place), so the time in the ejecta's frame is the proper time, and the other frame (Galaxy) sees longer time.\n\nSo I think the correct calculation leads to approximately 3,061,800 km, which isn't exactly any of the options, but the closest is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check the calculation again for any mistakes.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the approximation that the time in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame, which would lead to option B (3,000,000 km). But that's incorrect because we can't ignore relativity effects at 0.2c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the velocity and time in the same frame. But that would be wrong. So I think the correct answer is option D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame using principles of special relativity. The ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, and the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at a speed of \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), which is \\( 0.2c \\) (where \\( c = 300,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\)).\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Time Dilation**:  \n   In special relativity, time dilation occurs between two frames moving relative to each other.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.\n\nThe question is about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, which I remember means no acceleration involved. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The problem is asking how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame after 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.\n\nHmm. Wait, wait. So time is measured differently in different frames. Oh right, time dilation comes into play here because of special relativity when frames are moving relative to each other. So I think I need to use the Lorentz factor here.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me break it down. The key here is to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that's 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nSo, the two frames are the ejecta (let's say frame S') and the Galaxy (frame S). The Galaxy is moving at velocity v relative to the ejecta. Wait, no, wait. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s. That means in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at the same speed, 60,000 km/s. Because velocities reverse when you switch frames, but the speed is the same in magnitude.\n\nSo, the speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is v = 60,000 km/s. But wait, wait\u2014hold on. Let me clarify: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the ejecta is at rest in its own frame, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at the same speed, 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, we have to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that's 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nBut time in the two frames isn't the same. Because of time dilation, the time experienced in one frame is different from the other. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, but wait again. The time measured in each frame depends on whose perspective we're considering. Since the events are the start and end of the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, we need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the velocity and the time each frame experiences. But I'm getting a bit stuck.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the formula for time dilation. Time dilation formula is T = gamma * t, where T is the time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy's frame), and t is the proper time (ejecta's frame). Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo here, t is 50 seconds. So T = gamma * 50.\n\nWait, but wait. Which frame is moving relative to which? The Galaxy is moving at v = 60,000 km/s relative to the ejecta. So the ejecta's frame is the rest frame, and the Galaxy's frame is moving at v relative to the ejecta. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than the ejecta's time. So T = gamma * t.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I get the direction right. The ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy. So from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at v. So in the Galaxy's frame, the time experienced is longer. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the Galaxy's clock shows more than 50 seconds.\n\nWait no, wait: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So the Galaxy's frame is the moving one relative to the ejecta. So when calculating time in the Galaxy's frame, we need to use the time dilation formula. Hmm, but I'm getting confused about which frame is which.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the velocity and the time in each frame to calculate the distance. Wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, and the time is T. So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is distance = v * T.\n\nBut I don't know T yet. Because T is the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is longer than the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nSo how do I find T?\n\nUsing time dilation: T = gamma * t, where t is the proper time (the time in the ejecta's frame). Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nBut wait, let's calculate gamma. v is 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that to m/s for easier calculations, but wait, maybe it's easier in km/s. Let me think: the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So v is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c (since 0.2 * 300,000 is 60,000). So v = 0.2c.\n\nSo gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.98 \u2248 1.0196.\n\nWait, wait, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0205. Hmm, let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCalculating sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me compute 0.96^(1/2). Let's see: 0.96 is 96/100. Let me see, 0.98^2 is 0.9604, so sqrt(0.96) is a bit less than 0.98. Wait, 0.98^2 = (1 - 0.02)^2 = 1 - 0.04 + 0.0004 = 0.9604. So 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is 0.0004 higher than 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is a bit less than 0.98. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, let me just compute it numerically:\n\nsqrt(0.96) = approximately 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0205.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.0205.\n\nSo T = gamma * t = 1.0205 * 50 seconds \u2248 51.025 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait, this can't be right because 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is a significant fraction but not extremely relativistic, so the time dilation isn't huge. So the time in the Galaxy frame is 50 * gamma, which is about 50 * 1.0205 \u2248 51.025 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is the proper time t the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, or is it the other way around?\n\nProper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end of the 50-second interval) happen at the same place. So if the ejecta is at rest in its own frame, then the start and end of the 50 seconds happen at the same place in the ejecta's frame, making t the proper time. So yes, t is 50 seconds, and T is gamma * t.\n\nSo in the Galaxy frame, the time that passes is about 51.025 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait, that's a very small effect. Let me check my calculation again.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s.\n\nc = 3e5 km/s.\n\nSo v/c = 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2.\n\nSo gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo T \u2248 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo in the Galaxy's frame, the time that has passed is approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nBut wait, the question is about how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during this time. So the distance is velocity multiplied by time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, velocity is v = 60,000 km/s, and time is T \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, that's close. But let me double-check the calculations for gamma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 0.96 = 0.96.\n\nLet me find the square root. Let me use the Taylor expansion or iterative method.\n\nLet me approximate sqrt(0.96). Let me consider x = 0.96.\n\nWe know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604, which is just a bit over 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is 0.98 - delta, where delta is small.\n\nLet me compute (0.98 - delta)^2 = 0.96.\n\nExpanding (0.98 - delta)^2 = 0.9604 - 1.96 delta + delta^2 = 0.96.\n\nAssuming delta is small, delta^2 is negligible.\n\nSo 0.9604 - 1.96 delta \u2248 0.96.\n\nSo 0.9604 - 0.96 = 1.96 delta.\n\n0.0004 = 1.96 delta \u2192 delta \u2248 0.0004 / 1.96 \u2248 0.00020408.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.98 - 0.00020408 \u2248 0.97979592.\n\nSo 1 / 0.97979592 \u2248 1.020506.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.020506.\n\nSo T = 50 * 1.020506 \u2248 51.0253 seconds.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0253 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.0253.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 * 1.0253 = 61,518.\n\nSo total is 3,000,000 + 61,518 = 3,061,518 km.\n\nHmm, the options don't have this exact number. Let's look at the options again.\n\nOption D: 3,060,000 km.\n\nOption C: 2,880,000 km.\n\nOption A: 2,940,000 km.\n\nOption B: 3,000,000 km.\n\nSo 3,061,518 is closest to option D, but it's not exactly matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering which frame's time to use. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s, so the ejecta's speed relative to the Galaxy is v = 60,000 km/s. So the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at that speed.\n\nWait, but when considering the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, that's just v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. So yes, the time is T = gamma * t, where t is the time in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should calculate it using length contraction instead. Or maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the approximation that the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by T. But perhaps I should compute the exact gamma and see.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute gamma more precisely. Let's compute gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96).\n\nCalculating sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) using more precise methods.\n\nLet me compute it numerically:\n\nI can use the Newton-Raphson method to find the square root of 0.96.\n\nLet me take an initial guess of x0 = 0.98.\n\nx1 = (x0 + 0.96/x0)/2.\n\nCompute x1: (0.98 + 0.96/0.98)/2.\n\n0.96 / 0.98 \u2248 0.9795918.\n\nSo x1 = (0.98 + 0.9795918)/2 = (1.9595918)/2 \u2248 0.9797959.\n\nNow compute x2 = (x1 + 0.96/x1)/2.\n\n0.96 / 0.9797959 \u2248 0.980392156.\n\nx2 = (0.9797959 + 0.980392156)/2 \u2248 (1.959188056)/2 \u2248 0.979594028.\n\nx3 = (0.979594028 + 0.96/0.979594028)/2.\n\n0.96 / 0.979594028 \u2248 0.980392156.\n\nSo x3 = (0.979594028 + 0.980392156)/2 \u2248 (1.959986184)/2 \u2248 0.979993092.\n\nx4 = (0.979993092 + 0.96 / 0.979993092)/2.\n\n0.96 / 0.979993092 \u2248 0.98000309.\n\nx4 = (0.979993092 + 0.98000309)/2 \u2248 (1.96)/2 = 0.98.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 0.98 squared is 0.9604, which is larger than 0.96. Hmm, perhaps the approximation is converging to 0.9798 or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just use a calculator's approximation.\n\nsqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.9797958971.\n\nSo gamma = 1 / 0.9797958971 \u2248 1.020605.\n\nSo T = 50 * 1.020605 \u2248 51.03025 seconds.\n\nSo distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03025 s = 60,000 * 51.03025.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n50 * 60,000 = 3,000,000.\n\n1.03025 * 60,000 = 61,815.\n\nTotal distance \u2248 3,061,815 km.\n\nLooking at the options again, the closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. But perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. Perhaps the problem is simpler, and I'm overcomplicating it by considering time dilation. Maybe the problem expects me to ignore relativistic effects, treating it as a classical mechanics problem. But the question specifies that both are inertial frames, and since the speed is a significant fraction of c (20% the speed of light), we can't ignore relativity.\n\nWait, another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. So in that frame, the time is t =50 seconds. So the distance the Galaxy travels in the ejecta's frame is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But that's the distance the Galaxy moves towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame. But the question is about the ejecta's movement in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased: \"what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nSo, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s towards the center. So in Galaxy's frame, the time is longer due to time dilation. So the distance the ejecta moves is v multiplied by T, where T is the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nBut earlier calculation gives T \u224851.03 seconds, so distance is 60,000 * 51.03 \u22483,061,800 km. But that's not exactly matching any option, except D is 3,060,000 km, which is close but not exact.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the approximation gamma \u22481, which would make T \u224850 seconds. Then the distance would be 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that can't be right because 60,000 km/s is 20% the speed of light, and gamma would be about 1.02, so the time would be 50*1.02=51 seconds, leading to a distance of about 3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate gamma exactly.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(1/0.96) = sqrt(25/24) \u22481.02060455.\n\nSo T = 50 * 1.02060455 \u224851.0302275 seconds.\n\nSo distance = 60,000 *51.0302275 \u22483,061,813.65 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the time dilation and just multiply v * t. But that would give 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would be incorrect because the time experienced is longer in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, more time passes. So the distance the ejecta moves is v multiplied by the dilated time.\n\nSo the correct calculation would be 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u22483,061,800 km, which is approximately option D, 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem expects us to compute using the inverse of gamma. Let me think again. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v. So perhaps the proper time is the time in the ejecta's frame, and the Galaxy's time is longer. So T = gamma * t.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the distance as v multiplied by T, where T is the time in the Galaxy's frame. So yes, that's what I did earlier.\n\nSo the answer should be approximately 3,061,800 km, but the closest option is D, 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses an approximate value for gamma. Let me compute gamma to three decimal places.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.02060455.\n\nSo T = 50 * 1.02060455 \u224851.0302275.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 *51.0302275 = 3,061,813.65 km.\n\nHmm, that's about 3,061,814 km. None of the options exactly match that, but option D is 3,060,000 km. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use a more precise value of gamma, but perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the distance in the ejecta's frame, not the Galaxy's frame. Wait, no, the question is about the distance in the Galaxy's frame. So no, that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v, so the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at v in the Galaxy's frame. So the distance it travels is v multiplied by T. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the time in the ejecta's frame is longer. Wait, that can't be right because the ejecta's frame is the proper frame for the event (start and end at same place), so the time in the ejecta's frame is the proper time, and the other frame (Galaxy) sees longer time.\n\nSo I think the correct calculation leads to approximately 3,061,800 km, which isn't exactly any of the options, but the closest is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check the calculation again for any mistakes.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the approximation that the time in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame, which would lead to option B (3,000,000 km). But that's incorrect because we can't ignore relativity effects at 0.2c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the velocity and time in the same frame. But that would be wrong. So I think the correct answer is option D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame using principles of special relativity. The ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, and the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at a speed of \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), which is \\( 0.2c \\) (where \\( c = 300,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\)).\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Time Dilation**:  \n   In special relativity, time dilation occurs between two frames moving relative to each other. The time experienced in the Galaxy's frame (\\( T \\)) is related to the proper time in the ejecta's frame (\\( t \\)) by the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\):  \n   \\[\n   T = \\gamma t\n   \\]  \n   where  \n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( v = 0.2c \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206\n   \\]  \n   Thus,  \n   \\[\n   T = 1.0206 \\times 50 \\, \\text{s} \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distance Traveled**:  \n   In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta travels at a constant speed \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) for the dilated time \\( T \\). The distance traveled is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = v \\times T = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\times 51.03 \\, \\text{s} \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Comparison with Options**:  \n   The calculated distance (\\( \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km} \\)) is closest to option D (\\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\)). While the exact value does not match any option perfectly, option D is the most reasonable choice given the approximations and rounding in the problem.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame is approximately \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\).\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. \n\nThe question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, so no acceleration involved here. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but I remember that in different reference frames, velocities don't just add up normally because of relativity, right? Oh wait, no, wait a second. Wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe we can treat this as a simple velocity addition problem in classical mechanics? Or is it special relativity?\n\nHmm, the problem doesn't specify relativistic effects, but 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. Oh, that's pretty fast, so relativistic effects might come into play. But wait, the problem is asking about the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame, so maybe it's a question about time dilation or length contraction.\n\nWait, the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, they have a clock that says 50 seconds have passed. But in the Galaxy's frame, that same time would be different due to time dilation. Or wait, no\u2014because the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy. Or perhaps the question is about how much distance the ejecta covers in the Galaxy's frame during a certain time in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem is asking: What distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, from the ejecta's perspective, 50 seconds have gone by, and I need to find out how much the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nSo, I think I need to calculate the proper time or something. Wait, no, perhaps it's about the time experienced in each frame. Alternatively, maybe it's about using the Lorentz transformation to find out the time in the Galaxy's frame, then multiply by velocity to get the distance.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the ejecta and the Galaxy are both inertial frames. So, according to classical mechanics, the relative velocity would just be 60,000 km/s. But given that 60,000 is a significant fraction of c, relativistic effects would matter for time measurements.\n\nLet me outline the given data:\n\n- From the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative velocity between S' (ejecta) and S (Galaxy) is 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center, so in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, the problem states: \"From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s towards it.\" So, in S', the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So, the relative speed between S and S' is 60,000 km/s. So, according to the problem, in S' (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards it at some velocity u. But according to the problem, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s. So, we need to find u, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you have two frames moving relative to each other, the velocity in one frame is the negative of the other. So, if in S' (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is moving at +60,000 km/s (towards the ejecta), then in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at -60,000 km/s. Because the velocity is relative. So, the ejecta's velocity in the Galaxy's frame is u = 60,000 km/s towards the Galactic center.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think: If in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v = 60,000 km/s, then in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at the same speed. Because relative velocity is opposite. So, u = 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but that's only true in classical mechanics. Relativistically, velocities don't add like that. Oh, right! So, perhaps the correct way is to apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity.\n\nWait, but the problem says that both are inertial frames, so we must use special relativity. So, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is u, and the velocity of the Galaxy in the ejecta's frame is v. According to the velocity addition formula, in special relativity, the relation between u and v is given by:\n\nv = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. The velocity observed in one frame (S) as u is related to the velocity in another frame (S') moving at speed w relative to S as:\n\nu' = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/(c\u00b2))\n\nWait, or is it the other way around? Maybe I should think about it differently. Let me set up the scenario.\n\nLet me define the frames:\n\n- Frame S: Galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center at velocity u (unknown).\n\n- Frame S': Ejecta's frame. The Galactic center is approaching at velocity v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, according to S, the Galactic center is stationary, and the ejecta is moving towards it at u.\n\nBut according to S', the ejecta is stationary, and the Galactic center is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, the relationship between u and v is given by the velocity transformation formula. The formula from S to S' is:\n\nv = (u + w) / (1 + (u w)/(c\u00b2)) )\n\nWait, no, that's when S' is moving at speed w relative to S. Wait, no, the standard formula is:\n\nIf frame S' moves at velocity w relative to S (along the x-axis), then the velocity u' of an object in S' is:\n\nu' = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/(c\u00b2))\n\nIn this case, S is the Galaxy's frame, and S' is the ejecta's frame. So, the ejecta's frame is moving at velocity w relative to S. Wait, what's the velocity of S' relative to S?\n\nIn S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at u. So, the velocity of S' relative to S is w = u, but in the opposite direction? Wait, no, because in S, the ejecta is moving at u, so the frame S' (attached to the ejecta) is moving at velocity u relative to S.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me define it clearly.\n\nLet me set S as the rest frame of the Galaxy. In S, the ejecta is moving with velocity u towards the Galactic center. The Galactic center is at rest in S.\n\nThe ejecta's frame S' is moving at velocity w = u relative to S (since in S, the ejecta is moving at u).\n\nSo, the velocity of the Galactic center (origin of S) as observed in S' is given by the velocity addition formula.\n\nThe formula for the velocity of the Galactic center in S' is:\n\nv = (w - u') / (1 - (w u')/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, the formula for transforming velocities from S to S' is:\n\nu' = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nSo, in this case, in S, the Galactic center is at rest, so u = 0 (since Galactic center isn't moving in its own frame). So, the velocity of the Galactic center in S' is:\n\nv = (0 - w)/(1 - (0 * w)/c\u00b2 ) = -w / 1 = -w.\n\nBut according to the problem, in S', the Galactic center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So, v = -60,000 km/s (negative because it's moving towards the ejecta, which is at rest in S').\n\nSo, v = -60,000 = -w.\n\nSo, w = 60,000 km/s.\n\nBut w is the velocity of S' relative to S. So, w = u. Because in S, the ejecta is moving at u = w = 60,000 km/s towards the Galactic center.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because in S, the ejecta is moving at u, and in S' (attached to the ejecta), the Galactic center is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta.\n\nWait, maybe I should think that in S', the velocity of the Galactic center is v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So, v is the velocity of S (Galaxy) as seen from S' (ejecta). So, according to the velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (u - w) / (1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but I'm getting tangled up. Let me try this again.\n\nIn S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at u towards the Galactic center. So, the velocity of S' (ejecta's frame) relative to S is w = u.\n\nIn S', the velocity of the Galactic center (which is at rest in S) is v.\n\nUsing the velocity addition formula, v = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nWait, but in S, the Galactic center is at rest, so u = 0. So, substituting u = 0, we get v = (0 - w)/(1 - 0) = -w.\n\nSo, v = -w.\n\nBut the problem says that in S', the Galactic center is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So, v = 60,000 km/s. But from the formula, v = -w.\n\nSo, -w = 60,000 \u2192 w = -60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but w is the velocity of S' relative to S. So, if w is negative, that would mean that S' is moving at -60,000 km/s relative to S. But in S, the ejecta is moving at u = w = -60,000 km/s. That would mean the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galactic center, which aligns with the problem statement.\n\nWait, no, wait. In S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center. So, the velocity u is positive if towards the Galactic center, or negative if away. Let's say the Galactic center is at x=0, and the ejecta is moving towards it, so u is positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set up the coordinate system: let\u2019s say in S (Galaxy frame), the Galactic center is at rest at x=0. The ejecta is moving towards x=0, so its velocity u is positive.\n\nIn S', the ejecta is at rest, and the Galactic center is moving towards the ejecta at v=60,000 km/s. So, in S', the Galactic center is approaching at 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, the velocity of the Galactic center (origin of S) in S' is v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, which is S' moving towards the Galactic center.\n\nSo, using the velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (u - w) / (1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nBut wait, what is w here? w is the velocity of S' relative to S. Since in S, the ejecta is moving at u, then w is u.\n\nSo, substituting, we have:\n\nv = (u - u) / (1 - (u^2)/c\u00b2 ) \u2192 v = 0 / denominator \u2192 v=0. Which can't be right.\n\nHmm, that can't be correct. I must be mixing up the formulas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is v = (u + w) / (1 + (u w)/(c\u00b2)), but I'm not sure. Let me think about the direction.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the Lorentz transformation. Let me consider the events.\n\nWe need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. Then, using that time, compute the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because in the ejecta's frame, their proper time is 50 seconds. But due to time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer.\n\nSo, the time in the Galaxy's frame (t) and the time in the ejecta's frame (t') are related by the time dilation formula:\n\nt' = t * sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, no, the correct formula is t' = gamma (t - (v x)/c\u00b2 ), but perhaps in this case, since the events are at the same place in the ejecta's frame, x' = 0.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think step by step.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- S: Galaxy's frame (rest frame)\n- S': Ejecta's frame (moving at velocity u towards S's origin)\n\nIn S', the Galactic center is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So, in S', the Galactic center is approaching at 60,000 km/s.\n\nWe need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) during 50 seconds in S' (ejecta's frame).\n\nSo, first, find the velocity u of the ejecta in S.\n\nBut from the problem statement, we know that in S', the Galactic center is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. So, using the velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (u - w) / (1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but w is the velocity of S' relative to S. Since in S, the ejecta is moving at u, w = u.\n\nSo, substituting, v = (u - u) / (1 - (u\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 0 / denominator \u2192 v = 0.\n\nThat can\u2019t be right because the problem states v is 60,000 km/s. So perhaps I have the formula wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nv = (u + w) / (1 + (u w)/(c\u00b2)) )\n\nWait, maybe I should switch the order. Let me think again. The velocity of the Galactic center as seen in S' is v, which is 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta.\n\nThe velocity of S' relative to S is w = u (since in S, the ejecta is moving at u towards S's origin).\n\nSo, the formula for the velocity of the Galactic center in S' is v = (u + w') / (1 + (u w')/c\u00b2 ), but I'm getting confused about the primed and unprimed variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the Lorentz transformation for time and position.\n\nLet me consider two events: the start and the end of the 50-second interval in S'.\n\nIn S', these events occur at x' = 0, t' = 0 and x' = 0, t' = 50 s.\n\nWe need to find the corresponding time t in S, and then compute the distance the ejecta has moved in that time.\n\nWait, but in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u. So, in S, the ejecta's position at time t is x = u * t.\n\nSo, the distance traveled is x = u * t.\n\nBut to find t, we need to relate it to t' using the Lorentz transformation.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation equations are:\n\nt = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 )\n\nx = gamma (x' + v t' )\n\nSince in S', x' = 0 for both events, the equations simplify.\n\nFor the first event (t'=0, x'=0):\n\nt1 = gamma * (0 + 0) = 0.\n\nx1 = gamma * (0 + v*0) = 0.\n\nFor the second event (t'=50 s, x'=0):\n\nt2 = gamma (50 + (v * 0)/c\u00b2 ) = gamma * 50.\n\nx2 = gamma (0 + v * 50 ) = gamma * 50 v.\n\nBut wait, the velocity v here is the velocity of S' relative to S. So, in this case, v is the velocity of the ejecta (S') relative to S. So, v = u.\n\nWait, no, in the Lorentz transformation, v is the velocity of S' relative to S. So, in our setup, v is the same as the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame, which is u.\n\nSo, substituting, v = u.\n\nSo, t2 = gamma * 50.\n\nAnd the distance the ejecta travels in S is x2 = gamma * u * 50.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) during t2 seconds. So, the distance is x2 = u * t2.\n\nWait, no, because in S, the ejecta is moving at u, so during time t2, the distance is u * t2.\n\nSo, substituting t2 = gamma * 50, the distance is u * gamma * 50.\n\nBut wait, we need to find u. Because in S', the Galactic center is moving at v =60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but earlier I tried to relate u and v using the velocity addition formula and got confused. Let me try that again.\n\nIn S, the Galactic center is stationary. The ejecta is moving at u towards the Galactic center. So, in S', which is the ejecta's frame, the Galactic center is moving at v =60,000 km/s.\n\nThe velocity addition formula is:\n\nv = (u - w) / (1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nBut w is the velocity of S' relative to S. Since S' is moving at u relative to S, w = u.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the velocity of S' relative to S is u, because in S, the ejecta is moving at u. So, S' is moving at u relative to S.\n\nSo, the velocity v (of the Galactic center in S') is given by:\n\nv = (0 - u) / (1 - (0 * u)/c\u00b2 ) = -u.\n\nBut the problem states that in S', the Galactic center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So, v =60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, -u =60,000 \u2192 u = -60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but u is the velocity of the ejecta in S (Galaxy's frame), which is moving towards the Galactic center. So, if u is negative, that would imply it's moving in the opposite direction. That can't be right. So perhaps I have the direction wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set up the coordinate system such that positive x is away from the Galactic center. So, in S, the Galactic center is at x=0. The ejecta is moving towards x=0, so its velocity u is negative.\n\nSo, in S, u = -60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but then in S', the Galactic center is moving towards the ejecta at v =60,000 km/s. So, substituting:\n\nv = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but w is the velocity of S' relative to S, which is u. Because in S, S' is moving at u (ejecta's velocity).\n\nSo, substituting u = -60,000 km/s, w = u = -60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, v = ( (-60,000) - (-60,000) ) / (1 - ( (-60,000) * (-60,000) ) / c\u00b2 )\n\nThe numerator becomes 0. So, v = 0.\n\nBut that's not matching the problem statement. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's assume that the velocity u is 60,000 km/s towards the Galactic center in the Galaxy's frame. So, u = 60,000 km/s.\n\nThen, in the ejecta's frame, what would be the speed of the Galactic center? Using the velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (u + v') / (1 + (u v')/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should use the formula correctly. The velocity of the Galactic center in S' is given by:\n\nv = (u - w) / (1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nBut I'm getting stuck again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using classical mechanics, ignoring relativity. Let's check what the options are.\n\nThe options are in the millions of km, so 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. That's option B. But wait, the problem is about the distance in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, if time is dilated, the actual time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance would be more than 3,000,000 km.\n\nWait, but if the problem is intended to be treated classically, then the answer would be 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But considering that 60,000 is a significant fraction of c, we shouldn't ignore relativity.\n\nWait, but the problem says to ignore gravity and rotation, but doesn't say to ignore relativity. So, I think I need to consider time dilation.\n\nSo, let's try this again.\n\nIn S', the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So, t' =50 s.\n\nIn S, the Galaxy's frame, the time is t = gamma * t', where gamma is the Lorentz factor.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (u\u00b2/c\u00b2)), where u is the velocity of the ejecta in S.\n\nBut we don't know u yet. Wait, but from the problem, in S', the Galactic center is moving at v =60,000 km/s.\n\nHmm. So, using the velocity addition formula, v = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 ), where w is the velocity of S' relative to S.\n\nWait, S' is moving at u relative to S, so w = u.\n\nSo, v = (u - u)/(1 - (u^2/c^2)) ) \u2192 v = 0. That's not possible, so perhaps I'm using the formula incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in S', the Galactic center is moving towards the ejecta (S') at v =60,000 km/s. So, in S, the Galactic center is stationary, and the ejecta is moving towards it at u.\n\nSo, the velocity of the Galactic center in S' is v =60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, using the velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (u - w) / (1 - (u w)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nBut w is the velocity of S' relative to S, which is u (since in S, the ejecta is moving at u). So, substituting:\n\nv = (u - u)/(1 - (u^2/c^2)) \u2192 v =0. But that's not right.\n\nSo, I must have the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should use v = (u + w)/(1 + (u w)/c\u00b2 ), but I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the relationship between the two velocities.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The problem says that in S', the Galactic center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative speed between S and S' is 60,000 km/s. So, the speed u of the ejecta in S is 60,000 km/s. Because in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center at 60,000 km/s.\n\nBut wait, that's assuming classical velocity addition, which would give u =60,000 km/s.\n\nBut then, the time in S would be longer due to time dilation. So, the time in S would be t = gamma * t', where t' is 50 s.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (u^2/c^2)).\n\nSo, let's compute gamma.\n\nu =60,000 km/s \u2192 6e4 km/s.\n\nc =3e5 km/s.\n\nSo, u^2 = (6e4)^2 = 3.6e9 (km\u00b2/s\u00b2).\n\nc^2 = 9e10.\n\nSo, u\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 3.6e9 / 9e10 = 0.04.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.9798.\n\nSo, gamma \u2248 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 \u224851.03 seconds.\n\nSo, the distance in S (Galaxy's frame) is u * t =6e4 km/s *51.03 s = 6e4 *51.03.\n\n6e4 is 60,000. 60,000 *51.03 = Let's calculate:\n\n60,000 *50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.03 =61,800.\n\nSo, total is 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. So, close enough.\n\nWait, but wait. Did I compute gamma correctly?\n\nLet me compute u\u00b2/c\u00b2 again.\n\nu =6e4 km/s.\n\nu\u00b2 = (6e4)^2 = 36e8 (km\u00b2/s\u00b2).\n\nc\u00b2= (3e5)^2 =9e10 (km\u00b2/s\u00b2).\n\nSo, u\u00b2/c\u00b2 =36e8 /9e10 = (36/9) * (1e8 /1e10) )=4 * 0.0001 =0.0004.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because 36e8 is 3.6e9, and 9e10 is 9e10.\n\nSo, 3.6e9 /9e10 = (3.6 /9) *1e-1 =0.4 *0.1=0.04. So, 0.04 is correct.\n\nSo, 1 -0.04=0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96)= approximately 0.9798.\n\nSo, gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nSo, t=50 *1.0206 \u224851.03 s.\n\nDistance: u * t=6e4 km/s *51.03 s= 6e4 *51.03= 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. So, that's the closest. But let me check if I made any calculation errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the relativistic velocity addition formula correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the velocity u is not 60,000 km/s in S, but we have to compute it using the velocity addition formula.\n\nWait, in S', the Galactic center is moving at v=60,000 km/s towards the ejecta.\n\nIn S, the Galactic center is at rest, so the ejecta's velocity is u.\n\nUsing the velocity addition formula, the velocity of the Galactic center in S' is v = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 ), but I'm getting stuck because I'm not sure about w.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that u=60,000 km/s in S, compute gamma, then find t and the distance.\n\nSo, with gamma \u22481.0206, t\u224851.03 s.\n\nDistance=6e4 *51.03=3,061,800 km. So, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved classically, ignoring relativity. Then, distance=60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut given that the problem involves a significant fraction of the speed of light, I think the correct approach is to include relativity. So, the correct answer would be option D: 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, but let me recheck the calculation of gamma.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).\n\nv is 60,000 km/s.\n\nv^2 = (6e4)^2 =3.6e9 (km\u00b2/s\u00b2).\n\nc^2=9e10.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2= 0.04.\n\nSo, 1 -0.04=0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96)=approx 0.9798.\n\ngamma=1/0.9798\u22481.0206.\n\nSo, t=50 *1.0206=51.03 s.\n\nDistance=6e4 *51.03=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, perhaps I should compute more accurately.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nWe can compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me approximate:\n\n0.98^2=0.9604. So, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, as I had before.\n\nSo, gamma=1/0.9798 \u22481.0206.\n\nSo, t=50 *1.0206=51.03 s.\n\nDistance=60,000 km/s *51.03 s= 60,000 *51.03 = ?\n\n60,000 *50 =3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.03=61,800.\n\nTotal=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. The closest option is D: 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute without considering time dilation, using the proper time.\n\nWait, the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer. So, the distance is u multiplied by the longer time.\n\nSo, u=60,000 km/s.\n\nTime in Galaxy's frame: t= gamma * t' = (1/sqrt(1 -0.04)) *50= (1/0.9798)*50 \u224851.03 s.\n\nSo, distance=60,000 *51.03 \u22483,061,800 km.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option D, 3,060,000 km, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me compute 60,000 *51.03.\n\n51.03 *60,000.\n\n51 *60,000=3,060,000.\n\n0.03 *60,000=1,800.\n\nTotal:3,061,800.\n\nHmm, but the option is 3,060,000, which is 3,060,000 km. So, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, leading to t=51 s, giving 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the time as 50 s, but that would give 3,000,000 km, option B. But that would be ignoring time dilation, which isn't correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the velocity in the frame, without considering time dilation. So, perhaps the intended answer is option B.\n\nBut the correct approach would include relativity, so the correct answer should be option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. \n\nThe question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, so no acceleration involved here. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but I remember that in different reference frames, velocities don't just add up normally because of relativity, right? Oh wait, no, wait a second. Wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe we can treat this as a simple velocity addition problem in classical mechanics? Or is it special relativity?\n\nHmm, the problem doesn't specify relativistic effects, but 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. Oh, that's pretty fast, so relativistic effects might come into play. But wait, the problem is asking about the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame, so maybe it's a question about time dilation or length contraction.\n\nWait, the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, they have a clock that says 50 seconds have passed. But in the Galaxy's frame, that same time would be different due to time dilation. Or wait, no\u2014because the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy. Or perhaps the question is about how much distance the ejecta covers in the Galaxy's frame during a certain time in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem is asking: What distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, from the ejecta's perspective, 50 seconds have gone by, and I need to find out how much the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nSo, I think I need to calculate the proper time or something. Wait, no, perhaps it's about the time experienced in each frame. Alternatively, maybe it's about using the Lorentz transformation to find out the time in the Galaxy's frame, then multiply by velocity to get the distance.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the ejecta and the Galaxy are both inertial frames. So, according to classical mechanics, the relative velocity would just be 60,000 km/s. But given that 60,000 is a significant fraction of c, relativistic effects would matter for time measurements.\n\nLet me outline the given data:\n\n- From the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative velocity between S' (ejecta) and S (Galaxy) is 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center, so in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, the problem states: \"From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s towards it.\" So, in S', the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So, the relative speed between S and S' is 60,000 km/s. So, according to the problem, in S' (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards it at some velocity u. But according to the problem, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s. So, we need to find u, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you have two frames moving relative to each other, the velocity in one frame is the negative of the other. So, if in S' (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is moving at +60,000 km/s (towards the ejecta), then in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at -60,000 km/s. Because the velocity is relative. So, the ejecta's velocity in the Galaxy's frame is u = 60,000 km/s towards the Galactic center.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think: If in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v = 60,000 km/s, then in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at the same speed. Because relative velocity is opposite. So, u = 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but that's only true in classical mechanics. Relativistically, velocities don't add like that. Oh, right! So, perhaps the correct way is to apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity.\n\nWait, but the problem says that both are inertial frames, so we must use special relativity. So, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is u, and the velocity of the Galaxy in the ejecta's frame is v. According to the velocity addition formula, in special relativity, the relation between u and v is given by:\n\nv = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. The velocity observed in one frame (S) as u is related to the velocity in another frame (S') moving at speed w relative to S as:\n\nu' = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/(c\u00b2))\n\nWait, or is it the other way around? Maybe I should think about it differently. Let me set up the scenario.\n\nLet me define the frames:\n\n- Frame S: Galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center at velocity u (unknown).\n\n- Frame S': Ejecta's frame. The Galactic center is approaching at velocity v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, according to S, the Galactic center is stationary, and the ejecta is moving towards it at u.\n\nBut according to S', the ejecta is stationary, and the Galactic center is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, the relationship between u and v is given by the velocity transformation formula. The formula from S to S' is:\n\nv = (u + w) / (1 + (u w)/(c\u00b2)) )\n\nWait, no, that's when S' is moving at speed w relative to S. Wait, no, the standard formula is:\n\nIf frame S' moves at velocity w relative to S (along the x-axis), then the velocity u' of an object in S' is:\n\nu' = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/(c\u00b2))\n\nIn this case, S is the Galaxy's frame, and S' is the ejecta's frame. So, the ejecta's frame is moving at velocity w relative to S. Wait, what's the velocity of S' relative to S?\n\nIn S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at u. So, the velocity of S' relative to S is w = u, but in the opposite direction? Wait, no, because in S, the ejecta is moving at u, so the frame S' (attached to the ejecta) is moving at velocity u relative to S.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me define it clearly.\n\nLet me set S as the rest frame of the Galaxy. In S, the ejecta is moving with velocity u towards the Galactic center. The Galactic center is at rest in S.\n\nThe ejecta's frame S' is moving at velocity w = u relative to S (since in S, the ejecta is moving at u).\n\nSo, the velocity of the Galactic center (origin of S) as observed in S' is given by the velocity addition formula.\n\nThe formula for the velocity of the Galactic center in S' is:\n\nv = (w - u') / (1 - (w u')/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, the formula for transforming velocities from S to S' is:\n\nu' = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nSo, in this case, in S, the Galactic center is at rest, so u = 0 (since Galactic center isn't moving in its own frame). So, the velocity of the Galactic center in S' is:\n\nv = (0 - w)/(1 - (0 * w)/c\u00b2 ) = -w / 1 = -w.\n\nBut according to the problem, in S', the Galactic center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So, v = -60,000 km/s (negative because it's moving towards the ejecta, which is at rest in S').\n\nSo, v = -60,000 = -w.\n\nSo, w = 60,000 km/s.\n\nBut w is the velocity of S' relative to S. So, w = u. Because in S, the ejecta is moving at u = w = 60,000 km/s towards the Galactic center.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because in S, the ejecta is moving at u, and in S' (attached to the ejecta), the Galactic center is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta.\n\nWait, maybe I should think that in S', the velocity of the Galactic center is v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So, v is the velocity of S (Galaxy) as seen from S' (ejecta). So, according to the velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (u - w) / (1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but I'm getting tangled up. Let me try this again.\n\nIn S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at u towards the Galactic center. So, the velocity of S' (ejecta's frame) relative to S is w = u.\n\nIn S', the velocity of the Galactic center (which is at rest in S) is v.\n\nUsing the velocity addition formula, v = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nWait, but in S, the Galactic center is at rest, so u = 0. So, substituting u = 0, we get v = (0 - w)/(1 - 0) = -w.\n\nSo, v = -w.\n\nBut the problem says that in S', the Galactic center is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So, v = 60,000 km/s. But from the formula, v = -w.\n\nSo, -w = 60,000 \u2192 w = -60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but w is the velocity of S' relative to S. So, if w is negative, that would mean that S' is moving at -60,000 km/s relative to S. But in S, the ejecta is moving at u = w = -60,000 km/s. That would mean the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galactic center, which aligns with the problem statement.\n\nWait, no, wait. In S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center. So, the velocity u is positive if towards the Galactic center, or negative if away. Let's say the Galactic center is at x=0, and the ejecta is moving towards it, so u is positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set up the coordinate system: let\u2019s say in S (Galaxy frame), the Galactic center is at rest at x=0. The ejecta is moving towards x=0, so its velocity u is positive.\n\nIn S', the ejecta is at rest, and the Galactic center is moving towards the ejecta at v=60,000 km/s. So, in S', the Galactic center is approaching at 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, the velocity of the Galactic center (origin of S) in S' is v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, which is S' moving towards the Galactic center.\n\nSo, using the velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (u - w) / (1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nBut wait, what is w here? w is the velocity of S' relative to S. Since in S, the ejecta is moving at u, then w is u.\n\nSo, substituting, we have:\n\nv = (u - u) / (1 - (u^2)/c\u00b2 ) \u2192 v = 0 / denominator \u2192 v=0. Which can't be right.\n\nHmm, that can't be correct. I must be mixing up the formulas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is v = (u + w) / (1 + (u w)/(c\u00b2)), but I'm not sure. Let me think about the direction.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the Lorentz transformation. Let me consider the events.\n\nWe need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. Then, using that time, compute the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because in the ejecta's frame, their proper time is 50 seconds. But due to time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer.\n\nSo, the time in the Galaxy's frame (t) and the time in the ejecta's frame (t') are related by the time dilation formula:\n\nt' = t * sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, no, the correct formula is t' = gamma (t - (v x)/c\u00b2 ), but perhaps in this case, since the events are at the same place in the ejecta's frame, x' = 0.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think step by step.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- S: Galaxy's frame (rest frame)\n- S': Ejecta's frame (moving at velocity u towards S's origin)\n\nIn S', the Galactic center is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So, in S', the Galactic center is approaching at 60,000 km/s.\n\nWe need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) during 50 seconds in S' (ejecta's frame).\n\nSo, first, find the velocity u of the ejecta in S.\n\nBut from the problem statement, we know that in S', the Galactic center is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. So, using the velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (u - w) / (1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but w is the velocity of S' relative to S. Since in S, the ejecta is moving at u, w = u.\n\nSo, substituting, v = (u - u) / (1 - (u\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 0 / denominator \u2192 v = 0.\n\nThat can\u2019t be right because the problem states v is 60,000 km/s. So perhaps I have the formula wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nv = (u + w) / (1 + (u w)/(c\u00b2)) )\n\nWait, maybe I should switch the order. Let me think again. The velocity of the Galactic center as seen in S' is v, which is 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta.\n\nThe velocity of S' relative to S is w = u (since in S, the ejecta is moving at u towards S's origin).\n\nSo, the formula for the velocity of the Galactic center in S' is v = (u + w') / (1 + (u w')/c\u00b2 ), but I'm getting confused about the primed and unprimed variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the Lorentz transformation for time and position.\n\nLet me consider two events: the start and the end of the 50-second interval in S'.\n\nIn S', these events occur at x' = 0, t' = 0 and x' = 0, t' = 50 s.\n\nWe need to find the corresponding time t in S, and then compute the distance the ejecta has moved in that time.\n\nWait, but in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u. So, in S, the ejecta's position at time t is x = u * t.\n\nSo, the distance traveled is x = u * t.\n\nBut to find t, we need to relate it to t' using the Lorentz transformation.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation equations are:\n\nt = gamma (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2 )\n\nx = gamma (x' + v t' )\n\nSince in S', x' = 0 for both events, the equations simplify.\n\nFor the first event (t'=0, x'=0):\n\nt1 = gamma * (0 + 0) = 0.\n\nx1 = gamma * (0 + v*0) = 0.\n\nFor the second event (t'=50 s, x'=0):\n\nt2 = gamma (50 + (v * 0)/c\u00b2 ) = gamma * 50.\n\nx2 = gamma (0 + v * 50 ) = gamma * 50 v.\n\nBut wait, the velocity v here is the velocity of S' relative to S. So, in this case, v is the velocity of the ejecta (S') relative to S. So, v = u.\n\nWait, no, in the Lorentz transformation, v is the velocity of S' relative to S. So, in our setup, v is the same as the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame, which is u.\n\nSo, substituting, v = u.\n\nSo, t2 = gamma * 50.\n\nAnd the distance the ejecta travels in S is x2 = gamma * u * 50.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) during t2 seconds. So, the distance is x2 = u * t2.\n\nWait, no, because in S, the ejecta is moving at u, so during time t2, the distance is u * t2.\n\nSo, substituting t2 = gamma * 50, the distance is u * gamma * 50.\n\nBut wait, we need to find u. Because in S', the Galactic center is moving at v =60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but earlier I tried to relate u and v using the velocity addition formula and got confused. Let me try that again.\n\nIn S, the Galactic center is stationary. The ejecta is moving at u towards the Galactic center. So, in S', which is the ejecta's frame, the Galactic center is moving at v =60,000 km/s.\n\nThe velocity addition formula is:\n\nv = (u - w) / (1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nBut w is the velocity of S' relative to S. Since S' is moving at u relative to S, w = u.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the velocity of S' relative to S is u, because in S, the ejecta is moving at u. So, S' is moving at u relative to S.\n\nSo, the velocity v (of the Galactic center in S') is given by:\n\nv = (0 - u) / (1 - (0 * u)/c\u00b2 ) = -u.\n\nBut the problem states that in S', the Galactic center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So, v =60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, -u =60,000 \u2192 u = -60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but u is the velocity of the ejecta in S (Galaxy's frame), which is moving towards the Galactic center. So, if u is negative, that would imply it's moving in the opposite direction. That can't be right. So perhaps I have the direction wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set up the coordinate system such that positive x is away from the Galactic center. So, in S, the Galactic center is at x=0. The ejecta is moving towards x=0, so its velocity u is negative.\n\nSo, in S, u = -60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but then in S', the Galactic center is moving towards the ejecta at v =60,000 km/s. So, substituting:\n\nv = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but w is the velocity of S' relative to S, which is u. Because in S, S' is moving at u (ejecta's velocity).\n\nSo, substituting u = -60,000 km/s, w = u = -60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, v = ( (-60,000) - (-60,000) ) / (1 - ( (-60,000) * (-60,000) ) / c\u00b2 )\n\nThe numerator becomes 0. So, v = 0.\n\nBut that's not matching the problem statement. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's assume that the velocity u is 60,000 km/s towards the Galactic center in the Galaxy's frame. So, u = 60,000 km/s.\n\nThen, in the ejecta's frame, what would be the speed of the Galactic center? Using the velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (u + v') / (1 + (u v')/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should use the formula correctly. The velocity of the Galactic center in S' is given by:\n\nv = (u - w) / (1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 )\n\nBut I'm getting stuck again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using classical mechanics, ignoring relativity. Let's check what the options are.\n\nThe options are in the millions of km, so 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. That's option B. But wait, the problem is about the distance in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, if time is dilated, the actual time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance would be more than 3,000,000 km.\n\nWait, but if the problem is intended to be treated classically, then the answer would be 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But considering that 60,000 is a significant fraction of c, we shouldn't ignore relativity.\n\nWait, but the problem says to ignore gravity and rotation, but doesn't say to ignore relativity. So, I think I need to consider time dilation.\n\nSo, let's try this again.\n\nIn S', the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So, t' =50 s.\n\nIn S, the Galaxy's frame, the time is t = gamma * t', where gamma is the Lorentz factor.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (u\u00b2/c\u00b2)), where u is the velocity of the ejecta in S.\n\nBut we don't know u yet. Wait, but from the problem, in S', the Galactic center is moving at v =60,000 km/s.\n\nHmm. So, using the velocity addition formula, v = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 ), where w is the velocity of S' relative to S.\n\nWait, S' is moving at u relative to S, so w = u.\n\nSo, v = (u - u)/(1 - (u^2/c^2)) ) \u2192 v = 0. That's not possible, so perhaps I'm using the formula incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in S', the Galactic center is moving towards the ejecta (S') at v =60,000 km/s. So, in S, the Galactic center is stationary, and the ejecta is moving towards it at u.\n\nSo, the velocity of the Galactic center in S' is v =60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, using the velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (u - w) / (1 - (u w)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nBut w is the velocity of S' relative to S, which is u (since in S, the ejecta is moving at u). So, substituting:\n\nv = (u - u)/(1 - (u^2/c^2)) \u2192 v =0. But that's not right.\n\nSo, I must have the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should use v = (u + w)/(1 + (u w)/c\u00b2 ), but I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the relationship between the two velocities.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The problem says that in S', the Galactic center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative speed between S and S' is 60,000 km/s. So, the speed u of the ejecta in S is 60,000 km/s. Because in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center at 60,000 km/s.\n\nBut wait, that's assuming classical velocity addition, which would give u =60,000 km/s.\n\nBut then, the time in S would be longer due to time dilation. So, the time in S would be t = gamma * t', where t' is 50 s.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (u^2/c^2)).\n\nSo, let's compute gamma.\n\nu =60,000 km/s \u2192 6e4 km/s.\n\nc =3e5 km/s.\n\nSo, u^2 = (6e4)^2 = 3.6e9 (km\u00b2/s\u00b2).\n\nc^2 = 9e10.\n\nSo, u\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 3.6e9 / 9e10 = 0.04.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.9798.\n\nSo, gamma \u2248 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 \u224851.03 seconds.\n\nSo, the distance in S (Galaxy's frame) is u * t =6e4 km/s *51.03 s = 6e4 *51.03.\n\n6e4 is 60,000. 60,000 *51.03 = Let's calculate:\n\n60,000 *50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.03 =61,800.\n\nSo, total is 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. So, close enough.\n\nWait, but wait. Did I compute gamma correctly?\n\nLet me compute u\u00b2/c\u00b2 again.\n\nu =6e4 km/s.\n\nu\u00b2 = (6e4)^2 = 36e8 (km\u00b2/s\u00b2).\n\nc\u00b2= (3e5)^2 =9e10 (km\u00b2/s\u00b2).\n\nSo, u\u00b2/c\u00b2 =36e8 /9e10 = (36/9) * (1e8 /1e10) )=4 * 0.0001 =0.0004.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because 36e8 is 3.6e9, and 9e10 is 9e10.\n\nSo, 3.6e9 /9e10 = (3.6 /9) *1e-1 =0.4 *0.1=0.04. So, 0.04 is correct.\n\nSo, 1 -0.04=0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96)= approximately 0.9798.\n\nSo, gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nSo, t=50 *1.0206 \u224851.03 s.\n\nDistance: u * t=6e4 km/s *51.03 s= 6e4 *51.03= 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. So, that's the closest. But let me check if I made any calculation errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the relativistic velocity addition formula correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the velocity u is not 60,000 km/s in S, but we have to compute it using the velocity addition formula.\n\nWait, in S', the Galactic center is moving at v=60,000 km/s towards the ejecta.\n\nIn S, the Galactic center is at rest, so the ejecta's velocity is u.\n\nUsing the velocity addition formula, the velocity of the Galactic center in S' is v = (u - w)/(1 - (u w)/c\u00b2 ), but I'm getting stuck because I'm not sure about w.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that u=60,000 km/s in S, compute gamma, then find t and the distance.\n\nSo, with gamma \u22481.0206, t\u224851.03 s.\n\nDistance=6e4 *51.03=3,061,800 km. So, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved classically, ignoring relativity. Then, distance=60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut given that the problem involves a significant fraction of the speed of light, I think the correct approach is to include relativity. So, the correct answer would be option D: 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, but let me recheck the calculation of gamma.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).\n\nv is 60,000 km/s.\n\nv^2 = (6e4)^2 =3.6e9 (km\u00b2/s\u00b2).\n\nc^2=9e10.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2= 0.04.\n\nSo, 1 -0.04=0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96)=approx 0.9798.\n\ngamma=1/0.9798\u22481.0206.\n\nSo, t=50 *1.0206=51.03 s.\n\nDistance=6e4 *51.03=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, perhaps I should compute more accurately.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nWe can compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me approximate:\n\n0.98^2=0.9604. So, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, as I had before.\n\nSo, gamma=1/0.9798 \u22481.0206.\n\nSo, t=50 *1.0206=51.03 s.\n\nDistance=60,000 km/s *51.03 s= 60,000 *51.03 = ?\n\n60,000 *50 =3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.03=61,800.\n\nTotal=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. The closest option is D: 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute without considering time dilation, using the proper time.\n\nWait, the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer. So, the distance is u multiplied by the longer time.\n\nSo, u=60,000 km/s.\n\nTime in Galaxy's frame: t= gamma * t' = (1/sqrt(1 -0.04)) *50= (1/0.9798)*50 \u224851.03 s.\n\nSo, distance=60,000 *51.03 \u22483,061,800 km.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option D, 3,060,000 km, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me compute 60,000 *51.03.\n\n51.03 *60,000.\n\n51 *60,000=3,060,000.\n\n0.03 *60,000=1,800.\n\nTotal:3,061,800.\n\nHmm, but the option is 3,060,000, which is 3,060,000 km. So, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, leading to t=51 s, giving 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the time as 50 s, but that would give 3,000,000 km, option B. But that would be ignoring time dilation, which isn't correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the velocity in the frame, without considering time dilation. So, perhaps the intended answer is option B.\n\nBut the correct approach would include relativity, so the correct answer should be option D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame, considering relativistic effects due to the high velocity involved.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Frame Definitions**:\n   - **S (Galaxy's frame)**: The Galactic center is stationary, and the ejecta moves towards it at velocity \\( u \\).\n   - **S' (Ejecta's frame)**: The ejecta is stationary, and the Galactic center approaches at \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\).\n\n2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**:\n   The velocity of the Galactic center in S' is related to the velocity of the ejecta in S by the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n   \\[\n   v = \\frac{u - w}{1 - \\frac{u w}{c^2}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( w = u \\) (since S' moves at velocity \\( u \\) relative to S). Substituting \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   u = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Time Dilation**:\n   The problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (S'). Due to time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame (S) is:\n   \\[\n   t = \\gamma t',\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{u^2}{c^2}}} \\). Substituting \\( u = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( c = 300,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{u^2}{c^2} = \\frac{(60,000)^2}{(300,000)^2} = 0.04, \\quad \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206.\n   \\]\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   t = 1.0206 \\times 50 \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Distance Traveled**:\n   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = u \\cdot t = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\times 51.03 \\, \\text{s} \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison with Options**:\n   - **Option A**: \\( 2,940,000 \\, \\text{km} \\) \u2014 Too low.\n   - **Option B**: \\( 3,000,000 \\, \\text{km} \\) \u2014 Incorrect, as it ignores time dilation.\n   - **Option C**: \\( 2,880,000 \\, \\text{km} \\) \u2014 Too low.\n   - **Option D**: \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\) \u2014 Closest to the calculated value of \\( 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km} \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer, accounting for relativistic time dilation, is **Option D**.\n\nANSWER: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.\n\nThe problem says that a supernova occurred, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?\n\nWait, so I need to find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame, given the time in the ejecta's frame. But time might be different in each frame because of relativity, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, time dilation comes into play.\n\nLet me get the given data straight. The speed is 60,000 km/s. The time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. I think I need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, so I probably need to find the time that's experienced in the Galaxy's frame for those 50 seconds.\n\nWait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Because the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy, so their frames are moving relative to each other. So if I have a time measured in the ejecta's frame, I need to relate that to the time in the Galaxy's frame using time dilation.\n\nWait, but the problem says both are inertial frames. So I should probably use the Lorentz transformation equations. Let me recall: the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), where v is the relative speed between the frames.\n\nWait, but what's the speed here? The problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. That means the relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, the ejecta part is moving towards the center. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is approaching at v. So the speed is the same in both frames but in opposite directions.\n\nSo v is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that into units that are easier to work with, maybe m/s. 60,000 km is 6e4 km. 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 6e4 * 1e3 = 6e7 m/s. Wait, the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 6e7 m/s is 0.2 times the speed of light. Because 3e8 * 0.2 is 6e7. So v is 0.2c.\n\nWait, no, 6e7 is 60 million m/s. 3e8 is 300 million. So yes, 60 million is 0.2 times 300 million. So v is 0.2c.\n\nNow, the time given is t' = 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. I need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame. So first, perhaps I should find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, then multiply by the velocity to get the distance.\n\nWait, but in which frame is the velocity measured? Oh right, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is v, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center.\n\nSo, the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame would be v multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, t.\n\nSo I need to find t from the given t' =50 s.\n\nBut how does t relate to t'? Since the ejecta's frame is moving at v relative to the Galaxy's frame, the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame would be longer due to time dilation. Because in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), time runs slower.\n\nWait, no, the time in the moving frame (ejecta's) is t', and the stationary frame (Galaxy's) would see longer time. So t = gamma * t'.\n\nWait, let me think about this. The time dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where t is the time in the stationary frame (Galaxy) and t' is the moving frame (ejecta).\n\nYes, because from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock runs slower. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, more than 50 seconds would have passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nSo first, calculate gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nv is 0.2c, so v\u00b2 is 0.04 c\u00b2.\n\nSo 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is approx 0.9798. So gamma is 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nWait, wait, let me calculate it more precisely.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04.\n\n1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = (sqrt(96))/10. sqrt(96) is about 9.798. So sqrt(0.96) is about 0.9798.\n\nSo gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait, that's only a small increase. Because the speed is 0.2c, so gamma is only about 1.02, so the time dilation effect is small.\n\nNow, the distance in the Galaxy frame is v * t.\n\nv is 0.2c, which is 0.2 * 3e5 km/s (since c is 3e5 km/s). Wait, no: 3e5 km/s is 300,000 km/s. So 0.2 * 3e5 = 6e4 km/s, which matches the given speed of 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nt is approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo distance d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n60,000 * 51.03 = ?\n\nWell, 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km.\n\n60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800 km.\n\nSo total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, but wait, let me compute 60,000 * 51.03 more accurately.\n\n51.03 = 50 + 1.03.\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 * 1.03 = 60,000 * 1 + 60,000 * 0.03 = 60,000 + 1,800 = 61,800.\n\nSo total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, close but a bit off. Wait, perhaps my approximation of gamma is not precise enough.\n\nLet me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nCompute 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96.\n\nCompute sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me calculate it more precisely.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = ?\n\nWe can compute it as follows.\n\nWe know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604, which is a bit more than 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.\n\nBut let's get more precise.\n\nLet me use a calculator method. Let me think about it as 0.96 is 96/100.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(96) = 9.798 approximately.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Taylor expansion or binomial expansion for sqrt(1 - x).\n\nLet me write 0.96 as 1 - 0.04. So sqrt(1 - 0.04) \u2248 1 - 0.04/2 - (0.04)^2/(8) + ... \n\nWait, the expansion is sqrt(1 - x) \u2248 1 - x/2 - x\u00b2/(8) for small x.\n\nx is 0.04, so:\n\nsqrt(1 -0.04) \u2248 1 - (0.04)/2 - (0.04)^2 / 8.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n0.04/2 = 0.02.\n\n(0.04)^2 = 0.0016. Divided by 8: 0.0002.\n\nSo 1 - 0.02 - 0.0002 = 0.9798.\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nSo t = 50 * 1.0206 = 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D) 3,060,000 km. Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a mistake in calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use exact calculation for gamma.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) precisely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 0.9798^2 = 0.96 (approx). But to get a more precise value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute gamma as follows:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nWe can compute sqrt(0.96) as approximately 0.9798.\n\nBut let me compute it with more decimal places.\n\nUsing a calculator approach: let me compute sqrt(0.96) as 0.9797958971...\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.02060482.\n\nSo t = 50 * 1.02060482 = 51.030241 s.\n\nSo d = 60,000 km/s * 51.030241 s = 60,000 * 51.030241 = let's compute.\n\n60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000.\n\n60,000 * 0.030241 = 60,000 * 0.03 = 1,800; 60,000 * 0.000241 = 14.46.\n\nSo 1,800 +14.46 = 1,814.46.\n\nSo total d = 3,060,000 + 1,814.46 = 3,061,814.46 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the only option close is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait, 3,061,814 is about 3.06 million km. Option D is 3,060,000, which is 3.06 million. So that's very close.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is using exact gamma, not an approximation. Let me think about another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the Lorentz transformation equations to find the distance.\n\nWait, another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. The distance the ejecta travels in its own frame would be zero, because it's stationary in its own frame. Wait, no, wait: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it, so the distance the center of the Galaxy covers in that frame is v * t' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, not the distance the Galaxy center moves in the ejecta's frame.\n\nHmm, perhaps I got confused earlier. So maybe the correct approach is to use the length contraction formula.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy's center is contracted. Because from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards it.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the distance in each frame.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for distance in the Galaxy's frame, considering the time in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. So I need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds.\n\nWhich brings me back to the time dilation approach.\n\nSo, the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is gamma * t' (since t' is the proper time in the ejecta's frame, I think? Wait, no, because the event is happening in the same place in the ejecta's frame? Or is it?)\n\nWait, the event is the ejecta moving towards the Galaxy's center. So in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it, and the time is 50 seconds.\n\nSo in the ejecta's frame, the center moves a distance of v * t' = 60,000 km/s *50 s = 3,000,000 km.\n\nBut in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center, and the time is longer because of time dilation.\n\nSo the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * (gamma * t') = 60,000 * (gamma *50).\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 *50 * gamma.\n\nWe have gamma as approximately 1.0206, so 60,000 *50 =3,000,000. Multiply by 1.0206: 3,000,000 *1.0206=3,061,800 km.\n\nWhich is 3,061,800 km, so approximately 3.06 million km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close but a bit less.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the calculation expects an exact value without approximating gamma.\n\nLet me compute gamma exactly.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = 0.979795897113...\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020604818.\n\nt = gamma * t' = 50 *1.020604818 \u224851.0302409 s.\n\nd =60,000 km/s *51.0302409 s =60,000 *51.0302409 = 3,061,814.454 km.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB)3,000,000 km.\n\nC)2,880,000 km.\n\nD)3,060,000 km.\n\nSo the closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. But wait, our calculation gives approximately 3,061,814 km, which is 3,061,814 km. So that's 1,814 km more than option D.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem expects us to compute using the velocity and the time in the galaxy frame without considering time dilation. Because if we ignore relativity, the time would be the same, so the distance would be 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km. That's option B.\n\nBut the question says that both are inertial frames, so we have to account for relativity. Hmm.\n\nWait, but another thought: in the problem, the time is measured in the ejecta's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is longer.\n\nWait, another approach: using the Lorentz transformation for velocity.\n\nWait, but I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick us into not considering time dilation. But the options don't have 3 million km as the correct answer, since option B is 3 million, but our calculation shows that the correct answer is a bit higher.\n\nWait, perhaps the intended approach is to compute the distance as v multiplied by t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is t' multiplied by gamma.\n\nSo, with t' =50 s, t =50 * gamma.\n\nBut using the exact value of gamma.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more precisely.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nCompute 1 / sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately. Let's see, 0.9798^2 is 0.96 (exactly, no: 0.9798 *0.9798 = ?\n\nLet me compute 0.9798 * 0.9798.\n\n= (0.98 -0.0002)^2 = 0.98^2 - 2 *0.98 *0.0002 + (0.0002)^2.\n\n0.98^2=0.9604.\n\n2 *0.98 *0.0002=0.000392.\n\nSo 0.9604 -0.000392=0.960008, plus 0.00000004=0.96000804.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.979795897.\n\nSo gamma is 1 / 0.979795897 \u22481.020604818.\n\nSo t=50 *1.020604818 =51.0302409 seconds.\n\nd=60,000 km/s *51.0302409 s= 60,000 *51.0302409 =3,061,814.454 km.\n\nWhich is approximately 3,061,814 km, which is 3,061,814 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is 1,814 km less than our calculated value. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let me think.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the distance the Galaxy's center moves in the ejecta's frame, but multiplied by gamma?\n\nWait, no, because in the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s for 50 seconds, so the distance is 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, this distance is longer due to length contraction or time dilation.\n\nWait, perhaps the distance is 3,000,000 km multiplied by gamma?\n\nWait, that would be 3,000,000 *1.0206\u22483,061,800 km, which matches our previous calculation.\n\nSo that's the same as before.\n\nSo the correct answer should be approximately 3,061,800 km, which is 3.0618 million km. The options have D as 3,060,000 km, which is very close. Perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest hundred thousand, but the options don't have that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is simply v multiplied by t', but that's incorrect because time in the Galaxy's frame is longer.\n\nWait, no, because t' is the proper time in the ejecta's frame. The Galaxy's frame would see a longer time, so the distance would be v multiplied by gamma * t'.\n\nWhich is what we did.\n\nSo, given all that, the correct answer should be 3,061,814 km, which isn't exactly an option. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options again, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is about 1,800 km less than our calculated value.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem expects us to ignore the time dilation effect and just compute 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km. But that's option B.\n\nBut the question says that both are inertial frames, implying that relativity effects are in play.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So we must consider the relative motion and time dilation.\n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate using gamma.\n\nSo the answer is approximately 3,061,800 km, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is D) 3,060,000 km, which is 3.06 million km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects to compute the distance as v multiplied by t', without considering time dilation. Which would give 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would ignore relativity, which the problem statement suggests shouldn't be done.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the problem is in one-dimensional motion, and the distance the ejecta travels is simply v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is gamma multiplied by t'.\n\nSo, with t'=50 s, t = gamma * t' \u22481.0206 *50 =51.03 s.\n\nv=60,000 km/s.\n\nSo d=60,000 *51.03 =3,061,800 km.\n\nWhich isn't an option, but option D is 3,060,000 km, which is 1,800 km less.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is approximating gamma as 1.02, leading to t=51 s, and d=60,000 *51=3,060,000 km. So perhaps the intended approach is to approximate gamma as 1.02, leading to option D.\n\nSo given that, the answer is D) 3,060,000 km.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.\n\nThe problem says that a supernova occurred, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?\n\nWait, so I need to find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame, given the time in the ejecta's frame. But time might be different in each frame because of relativity, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, time dilation comes into play.\n\nLet me get the given data straight. The speed is 60,000 km/s. The time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. I think I need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, so I probably need to find the time that's experienced in the Galaxy's frame for those 50 seconds.\n\nWait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Because the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy, so their frames are moving relative to each other. So if I have a time measured in the ejecta's frame, I need to relate that to the time in the Galaxy's frame using time dilation.\n\nWait, but the problem says both are inertial frames. So I should probably use the Lorentz transformation equations. Let me recall: the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), where v is the relative speed between the frames.\n\nWait, but what's the speed here? The problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. That means the relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, the ejecta part is moving towards the center. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is approaching at v. So the speed is the same in both frames but in opposite directions.\n\nSo v is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that into units that are easier to work with, maybe m/s. 60,000 km is 6e4 km. 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 6e4 * 1e3 = 6e7 m/s. Wait, the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 6e7 m/s is 0.2 times the speed of light. Because 3e8 * 0.2 is 6e7. So v is 0.2c.\n\nWait, no, 6e7 is 60 million m/s. 3e8 is 300 million. So yes, 60 million is 0.2 times 300 million. So v is 0.2c.\n\nNow, the time given is t' = 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. I need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame. So first, perhaps I should find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, then multiply by the velocity to get the distance.\n\nWait, but in which frame is the velocity measured? Oh right, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is v, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center.\n\nSo, the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame would be v multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, t.\n\nSo I need to find t from the given t' =50 s.\n\nBut how does t relate to t'? Since the ejecta's frame is moving at v relative to the Galaxy's frame, the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame would be longer due to time dilation. Because in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), time runs slower.\n\nWait, no, the time in the moving frame (ejecta's) is t', and the stationary frame (Galaxy's) would see longer time. So t = gamma * t'.\n\nWait, let me think about this. The time dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where t is the time in the stationary frame (Galaxy) and t' is the moving frame (ejecta).\n\nYes, because from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock runs slower. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, more than 50 seconds would have passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nSo first, calculate gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nv is 0.2c, so v\u00b2 is 0.04 c\u00b2.\n\nSo 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is approx 0.9798. So gamma is 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nWait, wait, let me calculate it more precisely.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04.\n\n1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = (sqrt(96))/10. sqrt(96) is about 9.798. So sqrt(0.96) is about 0.9798.\n\nSo gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait, that's only a small increase. Because the speed is 0.2c, so gamma is only about 1.02, so the time dilation effect is small.\n\nNow, the distance in the Galaxy frame is v * t.\n\nv is 0.2c, which is 0.2 * 3e5 km/s (since c is 3e5 km/s). Wait, no: 3e5 km/s is 300,000 km/s. So 0.2 * 3e5 = 6e4 km/s, which matches the given speed of 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nt is approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo distance d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n60,000 * 51.03 = ?\n\nWell, 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km.\n\n60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800 km.\n\nSo total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, but wait, let me compute 60,000 * 51.03 more accurately.\n\n51.03 = 50 + 1.03.\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 * 1.03 = 60,000 * 1 + 60,000 * 0.03 = 60,000 + 1,800 = 61,800.\n\nSo total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, close but a bit off. Wait, perhaps my approximation of gamma is not precise enough.\n\nLet me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nCompute 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96.\n\nCompute sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me calculate it more precisely.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = ?\n\nWe can compute it as follows.\n\nWe know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604, which is a bit more than 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.\n\nBut let's get more precise.\n\nLet me use a calculator method. Let me think about it as 0.96 is 96/100.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(96) = 9.798 approximately.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Taylor expansion or binomial expansion for sqrt(1 - x).\n\nLet me write 0.96 as 1 - 0.04. So sqrt(1 - 0.04) \u2248 1 - 0.04/2 - (0.04)^2/(8) + ... \n\nWait, the expansion is sqrt(1 - x) \u2248 1 - x/2 - x\u00b2/(8) for small x.\n\nx is 0.04, so:\n\nsqrt(1 -0.04) \u2248 1 - (0.04)/2 - (0.04)^2 / 8.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n0.04/2 = 0.02.\n\n(0.04)^2 = 0.0016. Divided by 8: 0.0002.\n\nSo 1 - 0.02 - 0.0002 = 0.9798.\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nSo t = 50 * 1.0206 = 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D) 3,060,000 km. Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a mistake in calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use exact calculation for gamma.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) precisely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 0.9798^2 = 0.96 (approx). But to get a more precise value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute gamma as follows:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nWe can compute sqrt(0.96) as approximately 0.9798.\n\nBut let me compute it with more decimal places.\n\nUsing a calculator approach: let me compute sqrt(0.96) as 0.9797958971...\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.02060482.\n\nSo t = 50 * 1.02060482 = 51.030241 s.\n\nSo d = 60,000 km/s * 51.030241 s = 60,000 * 51.030241 = let's compute.\n\n60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000.\n\n60,000 * 0.030241 = 60,000 * 0.03 = 1,800; 60,000 * 0.000241 = 14.46.\n\nSo 1,800 +14.46 = 1,814.46.\n\nSo total d = 3,060,000 + 1,814.46 = 3,061,814.46 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the only option close is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait, 3,061,814 is about 3.06 million km. Option D is 3,060,000, which is 3.06 million. So that's very close.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is using exact gamma, not an approximation. Let me think about another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the Lorentz transformation equations to find the distance.\n\nWait, another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. The distance the ejecta travels in its own frame would be zero, because it's stationary in its own frame. Wait, no, wait: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it, so the distance the center of the Galaxy covers in that frame is v * t' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, not the distance the Galaxy center moves in the ejecta's frame.\n\nHmm, perhaps I got confused earlier. So maybe the correct approach is to use the length contraction formula.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy's center is contracted. Because from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards it.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the distance in each frame.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for distance in the Galaxy's frame, considering the time in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. So I need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds.\n\nWhich brings me back to the time dilation approach.\n\nSo, the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is gamma * t' (since t' is the proper time in the ejecta's frame, I think? Wait, no, because the event is happening in the same place in the ejecta's frame? Or is it?)\n\nWait, the event is the ejecta moving towards the Galaxy's center. So in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it, and the time is 50 seconds.\n\nSo in the ejecta's frame, the center moves a distance of v * t' = 60,000 km/s *50 s = 3,000,000 km.\n\nBut in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center, and the time is longer because of time dilation.\n\nSo the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * (gamma * t') = 60,000 * (gamma *50).\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 *50 * gamma.\n\nWe have gamma as approximately 1.0206, so 60,000 *50 =3,000,000. Multiply by 1.0206: 3,000,000 *1.0206=3,061,800 km.\n\nWhich is 3,061,800 km, so approximately 3.06 million km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close but a bit less.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the calculation expects an exact value without approximating gamma.\n\nLet me compute gamma exactly.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = 0.979795897113...\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020604818.\n\nt = gamma * t' = 50 *1.020604818 \u224851.0302409 s.\n\nd =60,000 km/s *51.0302409 s =60,000 *51.0302409 = 3,061,814.454 km.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB)3,000,000 km.\n\nC)2,880,000 km.\n\nD)3,060,000 km.\n\nSo the closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. But wait, our calculation gives approximately 3,061,814 km, which is 3,061,814 km. So that's 1,814 km more than option D.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem expects us to compute using the velocity and the time in the galaxy frame without considering time dilation. Because if we ignore relativity, the time would be the same, so the distance would be 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km. That's option B.\n\nBut the question says that both are inertial frames, so we have to account for relativity. Hmm.\n\nWait, but another thought: in the problem, the time is measured in the ejecta's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is longer.\n\nWait, another approach: using the Lorentz transformation for velocity.\n\nWait, but I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick us into not considering time dilation. But the options don't have 3 million km as the correct answer, since option B is 3 million, but our calculation shows that the correct answer is a bit higher.\n\nWait, perhaps the intended approach is to compute the distance as v multiplied by t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is t' multiplied by gamma.\n\nSo, with t' =50 s, t =50 * gamma.\n\nBut using the exact value of gamma.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more precisely.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nCompute 1 / sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately. Let's see, 0.9798^2 is 0.96 (exactly, no: 0.9798 *0.9798 = ?\n\nLet me compute 0.9798 * 0.9798.\n\n= (0.98 -0.0002)^2 = 0.98^2 - 2 *0.98 *0.0002 + (0.0002)^2.\n\n0.98^2=0.9604.\n\n2 *0.98 *0.0002=0.000392.\n\nSo 0.9604 -0.000392=0.960008, plus 0.00000004=0.96000804.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.979795897.\n\nSo gamma is 1 / 0.979795897 \u22481.020604818.\n\nSo t=50 *1.020604818 =51.0302409 seconds.\n\nd=60,000 km/s *51.0302409 s= 60,000 *51.0302409 =3,061,814.454 km.\n\nWhich is approximately 3,061,814 km, which is 3,061,814 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is 1,814 km less than our calculated value. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let me think.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the distance the Galaxy's center moves in the ejecta's frame, but multiplied by gamma?\n\nWait, no, because in the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s for 50 seconds, so the distance is 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, this distance is longer due to length contraction or time dilation.\n\nWait, perhaps the distance is 3,000,000 km multiplied by gamma?\n\nWait, that would be 3,000,000 *1.0206\u22483,061,800 km, which matches our previous calculation.\n\nSo that's the same as before.\n\nSo the correct answer should be approximately 3,061,800 km, which is 3.0618 million km. The options have D as 3,060,000 km, which is very close. Perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest hundred thousand, but the options don't have that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is simply v multiplied by t', but that's incorrect because time in the Galaxy's frame is longer.\n\nWait, no, because t' is the proper time in the ejecta's frame. The Galaxy's frame would see a longer time, so the distance would be v multiplied by gamma * t'.\n\nWhich is what we did.\n\nSo, given all that, the correct answer should be 3,061,814 km, which isn't exactly an option. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options again, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is about 1,800 km less than our calculated value.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem expects us to ignore the time dilation effect and just compute 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km. But that's option B.\n\nBut the question says that both are inertial frames, implying that relativity effects are in play.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So we must consider the relative motion and time dilation.\n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate using gamma.\n\nSo the answer is approximately 3,061,800 km, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is D) 3,060,000 km, which is 3.06 million km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects to compute the distance as v multiplied by t', without considering time dilation. Which would give 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would ignore relativity, which the problem statement suggests shouldn't be done.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the problem is in one-dimensional motion, and the distance the ejecta travels is simply v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is gamma multiplied by t'.\n\nSo, with t'=50 s, t = gamma * t' \u22481.0206 *50 =51.03 s.\n\nv=60,000 km/s.\n\nSo d=60,000 *51.03 =3,061,800 km.\n\nWhich isn't an option, but option D is 3,060,000 km, which is 1,800 km less.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is approximating gamma as 1.02, leading to t=51 s, and d=60,000 *51=3,060,000 km. So perhaps the intended approach is to approximate gamma as 1.02, leading to option D.\n\nSo given that, the answer is D) 3,060,000 km.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving at a velocity \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) (or \\( 0.2c \\)) towards the center of the Galaxy.

Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. \n\nSo, the problem says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, how much distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?\n\nWait, I need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, but the time given is from the ejecta's perspective. Oh right, this sounds like a problem involving time dilation or maybe length contraction because of special relativity. Since both are inertial frames, we're dealing with relative velocities and perhaps using the Lorentz transformations.\n\nWait, so the ejecta's frame sees the Galaxy moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. That's a pretty high speed\u2014like a significant fraction of the speed of light. Wait, let me check the speed of light. Oh right, it's approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2 times the speed of light. So that's 20% the speed of light. That's a significant speed, so relativistic effects might be noticeable.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so we can focus purely on the relative motion and possibly time dilation.\n\nHmm. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, 60,000 km/s. Wait, no. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add up like that when you change frames. But wait, since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed from either frame would be the same in the other frame, but that's only in the case of inertial frames. Or wait, no, velocities transform via the Lorentz velocity addition formula. So, I might need to compute the velocity in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, no, the problem states that both are inertial frames, so the velocity observed in each frame is 60,000 km/s towards each other. Wait, that can't be right because in special relativity, velocities don't add linearly. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem. The problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s. But from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at the same speed. Wait, but according to relativity, that's not possible because velocities don't transform like that. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, no. The problem says both are inertial frames, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, wait, that implies that the relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. But in reality, when you have two frames moving relative to each other at speed v, each frame sees the other moving at v, right? So perhaps that's the case here. So, the relative speed between the ejecta and the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but wait, if the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at v in the Galaxy's frame, then in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v. So yes, that makes sense. So the relative speed is v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, the problem is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. But due to time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer. Because from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slow.\n\nSo, let me think: when an observer in one frame sees another frame moving, they see the other frame's time as dilated. So, if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer because the ejecta's frame is moving relative to it. So, the proper time in the ejecta's frame is shorter than the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nThe Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So, let's compute gamma for v=60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, let's compute v in terms of c. v = 60,000 km/s, c = 300,000 km/s. So v = 0.2 c. So beta = v/c = 0.2.\n\nGamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1/sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nSo, the time in the Galaxy's frame, t, is gamma multiplied by the proper time t', which is 50 seconds.\n\nWait, no. Proper time is the time measured in the frame where the events happen at the same place. Wait, but in this case, the events are the start and end of the time interval. The start is when the ejecta is at a certain position, and after 50 seconds (in its own frame), it has moved some distance.\n\nWait, but in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So, the time measured in the ejecta's frame is the proper time. So, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer.\n\nSo, the time in the Galaxy frame is t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait, is t' the proper time? Because the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the process. Here, the process is the ejecta moving, so the ejecta's frame is the rest frame for the ejecta. So, the proper time is indeed t' =50 s. So yes, t = gamma * t' \u2248 51.03 s.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at v =60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v =60,000 km/s. The time is t = gamma * t' \u2248 51.03 s.\n\nSo, the distance would be v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 ?\n\nWait, let me compute that. 60,000 * 51.03 = ?\n\nWait, 60,000 *50 is 3,000,000. 60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800. So total is 3,061,800 km. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close to this.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma with more precise numbers.\n\nv =60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\nSo, v^2/c^2 = 0.04.\n\n1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.979795897.\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / 0.979795897 \u2248 1.02062.\n\nSo, gamma is approximately 1.02062.\n\nt = gamma * t' = 1.02062 *50 \u2248 51.031 seconds.\n\nSo, v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nDistance in Galaxy frame: 60,000 * 51.031 = ?\n\n60,000 *50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.031= 61,860.\n\nTotal is 3,061,860 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close. But why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem doesn't require using gamma because the speed is only 0.2c, and the time dilation effect is minimal. Let's compute gamma more accurately.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more precisely.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(1/0.96) \u2248 sqrt(1.04166667) \u2248 1.02062075.\n\nSo, gamma is approximately 1.02062075.\n\nt = 50 * gamma \u224850 *1.02062075=51.0310375 seconds.\n\nSo, the distance is 60,000 *51.0310375 = ?\n\nLet me compute 60,000 *51.0310375.\n\n60,000 *50 =3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.0310375=60,000*(1 +0.0310375) =60,000 + 60,000*0.0310375.\n\n60,000 *0.0310375 = 1,862.25.\n\nSo 60,000*1.0310375=61,862.25.\n\nSo total distance is 3,000,000 + 1,862.25 =3,001,862.25 km.\n\nWait, that's about 3,001,862 km, but the options don't have that. The options are A)2,940,000; B)3,000,000; C)2,880,000; D)3,060,000.\n\nHmm. None of the options exactly match 3,001,862 km. Wait, but option B is exactly 3,000,000 km, which is the distance if the time were 50 seconds without considering time dilation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not considering time dilation. Maybe the question is intended to be a simple velocity \u00d7 time, but that would be incorrect because the time experienced in each frame is different.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is expecting the use of the velocity in the Galaxy frame multiplied by the time in the Galaxy frame. But the time given is in the ejecta frame.\n\nSo, without considering relativity, one might think the ejecta travels v * t', but that's wrong because t' is the time in the ejecta's frame, but the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer. So, the correct approach is to use t = gamma * t' and multiply by v.\n\nBut according to the calculation, that gives about 3,061,862 km, which isn't exactly any of the options. Hmm. The closest option is D)3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute the exact numbers.\n\nWait, let's compute 60,000 km/s * 51.0310375 s = ?\n\n60,000 *51.0310375.\n\nLet me compute 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000.\n\n60,000 *0.0310375 = 1,862.25.\n\nSo total is 3,060,000 + 1,862.25 =3,061,862.25 km.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have that. So why is option D 3,060,000 km? Maybe the problem expects to ignore the time dilation effect, but that would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have the frames mixed up. Maybe the time given is in the Galaxy's frame, but the problem states it's in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, the question says: \"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nSo, in the Galaxy frame, the time is longer. So, the distance is v * t = v * gamma * t'.\n\nSo, 60,000 km/s * 1.02062 *50 s \u224860,000 *51.031 \u22483,061,862 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended approach is to ignore relativity, compute v*t', but that would be 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut the problem says both are inertial frames, so relativity should apply. So why is option D 3,060,000 km? Hmm, perhaps the calculation is approximated.\n\nWait, let's compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.02062075.\n\nt = gamma * t' = 1.02062075 *50 =51.0310375 s.\n\nSo, distance is 60,000 *51.0310375 =3,061,862.25 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem expects the use of v =60,000 km/s and t'=50 s, leading to 3,000,000 km (option B), but that would be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the rest frame of the Galaxy, and the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s, but the time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So, in the Galaxy frame, the time is longer, leading to more distance.\n\nBut why isn't the answer matching any option? Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to be a trick, and the answer is 3,000,000 km, but that would be incorrect according to relativity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the distance in the ejecta's frame is contracted, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it using length contraction. Let me think.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy's center is L = v * t_ejecta, where t_ejecta is the time in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but no, because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So, the distance between them is L = v * t_ejecta, where t_ejecta is the time until collision from the ejecta's perspective. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during t' =50 s in the ejecta's frame. So, to find that, I need to calculate how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame, t = gamma * t', and then multiply by the velocity in the Galaxy's frame, which is 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, distance = v * t =60,000 * gamma *50 =60,000 * 51.0310375 \u22483,061,862 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is B)3,000,000 km, but that would be the distance without considering relativity. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the proper time, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the time in the Galaxy's frame as t' and the ejecta's frame time as t. No, the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the distance in the ejecta's frame, but no, the question clearly states the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the distance using the time in the ejecta's frame without considering time dilation. So, 60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km. That's option B.\n\nBut that would be incorrect, because from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving for a longer time, so the distance should be more than 3,000,000 km. So option D is 3,060,000 km, which is about 60,000 *51 =3,060,000.\n\nWait, so perhaps the problem expects us to use gamma as 1.02 and 50 *1.02 =51 s, leading to 60,000 *51 =3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n\nSo, perhaps that's the intended approach, even if the calculation of gamma is approximate.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be option D, 3,060,000 km.\n",

Let's compute gamma more accurately.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more precisely.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(1/0.96) \u2248 sqrt(1.04166667) \u2248 1.02062075.\n\nSo, gamma is approximately 1.02062075.\n\nt = 50 * gamma \u224850 *1.02062075=51.0310375 seconds.\n\nSo, the distance is 60,000 *51.0310375 = ?\n\nLet me compute 60,000 *51.0310375.\n\n60,000 *50 =3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.0310375=60,000*(1 +0.0310375) =60,000 + 60,000*0.0310375.\n\n60,000 *0.0310375 = 1,862.25.\n\nSo 60,000*1.0310375=61,862.25.\n\nSo total distance is 3,000,000 + 1,862.25 =3,001,862.25 km.\n\nWait, that's about 3,001,862 km, but the options don't have that. The options are A)2,940,000; B)3,000,000; C)2,880,000; D)3,060,000.\n\nHmm. None of the options exactly match 3,001,862 km. Wait, but option B is exactly 3,000,000 km, which is the distance if the time were 50 seconds without considering time dilation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not considering time dilation. Maybe the question is intended to be a simple velocity \u00d7 time, but that would be incorrect because the time experienced in each frame is different.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is expecting the use of the velocity in the Galaxy frame multiplied by the time in the Galaxy frame. But the time given is in the ejecta frame.\n\nSo, without considering relativity, one might think the ejecta travels v * t', but that's wrong because t' is the time in the ejecta's frame, but the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer. So, the correct approach is to use t = gamma * t' and multiply by v.\n\nBut according to the calculation, that gives about 3,061,862 km, which isn't exactly any of the options. Hmm. The closest option is D)3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute the exact numbers.\n\nWait, let's compute 60,000 km/s * 51.0310375 s = ?\n\n60,000 *51.0310375.\n\nLet me compute 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000.\n\n60,000 *0.0310375 = 1,862.25.\n\nSo total is 3,060,000 + 1,862.25 =3,061,862.25 km.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have that. So why is option D 3,060,000 km? Maybe the problem expects to ignore the time dilation effect, but that would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have the frames mixed up. Maybe the time given is in the Galaxy's frame, but the problem states it's in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, the question says: \"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nSo, in the Galaxy frame, the time is longer. So, the distance is v * t = v * gamma * t'.\n\nSo, 60,000 km/s * 1.02062 *50 s \u224860,000 *51.031 \u22483,061,862 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended approach is to ignore relativity, compute v*t', but that would be 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut the problem says both are inertial frames, so relativity should apply. So why is option D 3,060,000 km? Hmm, perhaps the calculation is approximated.\n\nWait, let's compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.02062075.\n\nt = gamma * t' = 1.02062075 *50 =51.0310375 s.\n\nSo, distance is 60,000 *51.0310375 =3,061,862.25 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem expects the use of v =60,000 km/s and t'=50 s, leading to 3,000,000 km (option B), but that would be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the rest frame of the Galaxy, and the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s, but the time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So, in the Galaxy frame, the time is longer, leading to more distance.\n\nBut why isn't the answer matching any option? Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to be a trick, and the answer is 3,000,000 km, but that would be incorrect according to relativity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the distance in the ejecta's frame is contracted, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it using length contraction. Let me think.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy's center is L = v * t_ejecta, where t_ejecta is the time in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but no, because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So, the distance between them is L = v * t_ejecta, where t_ejecta is the time until collision from the ejecta's perspective. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during t' =50 s in the ejecta's frame. So, to find that, I need to calculate how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame, t = gamma * t', and then multiply by the velocity in the Galaxy's frame, which is 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, distance = v * t =60,000 * gamma *50 =60,000 * 51.0310375 \u22483,061,862 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is B)3,000,000 km, but that would be the distance without considering relativity. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the proper time, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the time in the Galaxy's frame as t' and the ejecta's frame time as t. No, the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the distance in the ejecta's frame, but no, the question clearly states the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the distance using the time in the ejecta's frame without considering time dilation. So, 60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km. That's option B.\n\nBut that would be incorrect, because from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving for a longer time, so the distance should be more than 3,000,000 km. So option D is 3,060,000 km, which is about 60,000 *51 =3,060,000.\n\nWait, so perhaps the problem expects us to use gamma as 1.02 and 50 *1.02 =51 s, leading to 60,000 *51 =3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n\nSo, perhaps that's the intended approach, even if the calculation of gamma is approximate.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be option D, 3,060,000 km.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), which is \\( 0.2c \\) (where \\( c = 300,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\)).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe question says that a supernova occurred in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, wait. So the frames are moving relative to each other. The galaxy is the rest frame, and the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy. But from the ejecta's perspective, the galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So that makes sense because if the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v, then in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, and vice versa. But wait, maybe there's a consideration of relative velocity here. Oh, right! Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly; there's the velocity addition formula to consider. But wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe we can treat this as a simple relative velocity problem without considering acceleration due to gravity or anything else.\n\nWait, but the problem is about how much distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during a certain time measured in the ejecta's frame. So I think this is a problem involving time dilation and length contraction, or maybe just relative velocity. But wait, let me think about the frames.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame (let's call it S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v. So the ejecta's frame (S') is moving at velocity v relative to S. But from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in S', the velocity of S (galaxy) is u = -v (since they're moving towards each other). Wait, no, according to the problem statement, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the velocity u of S (galaxy) as seen from S' (ejecta) is +60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. But in reality, the velocity of S' relative to S is v. So according to the velocity addition formula, the velocity u of S as seen from S' is u = (v - 0) / (1 + (v*0)/c\u00b2), but wait, wait. Maybe I'm mixing up the direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the two frames moving towards each other. If the galaxy's center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame, then from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy. Because when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed in each frame is the same, right? Wait, no, that's only in classical mechanics. In relativity, velocities don't just add like that.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the velocity addition formula. Let me recall it. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c\u00b2), where u is the velocity of an object in frame S (galaxy frame), and u' is the velocity in frame S' (ejecta frame), which is moving at velocity v relative to S.\n\nWait, no, I think I have the formula backwards. The velocity of an object in S as seen from S' is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c\u00b2)). Or maybe it's u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)), depending on the direction.\n\nWait, let me get the direction right. Let's assume that in the galaxy frame S, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at velocity v. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is u = -v (if we take the positive direction as away from the galaxy). So in S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S (since in S the ejecta is moving at v), the velocity u' of the galaxy (which is at rest in S) would be calculated using the velocity addition formula.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So u' is 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So u' = +60,000 km/s (if positive is towards the ejecta, which is moving towards the galaxy in S).\n\nWait, so applying the velocity addition formula. Let me set up the variables:\n\nIn S (galaxy frame), the ejecta's velocity is u = -v (since it's moving towards the galaxy, which is at rest in S). So the velocity of the galaxy in S' (ejecta's frame) would be u' = (u + v') / (1 + (u v')/c\u00b2), but I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that in S', the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so u' = 60,000 km/s (towards the ejecta). But according to the velocity addition formula, u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nWait, no. Let me get the direction correct. Let's define the positive direction as the direction the ejecta is moving in S (galaxy frame). So in S, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy, which is at rest in S. So the velocity of the ejecta in S is u = -v (because it's moving towards the galaxy, which is at rest in S).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So from S' (ejecta), the galaxy's velocity is u' = +60,000 km/s (since it's moving towards the ejecta). Now, what is the velocity of the galaxy in the S frame (galaxy's frame)?\n\nWait, the galaxy is at rest in its own frame, S. So in S, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at some speed v. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is u = -v (if we take the positive direction as away from the galaxy). Then, using the velocity addition formula, what is u' (galaxy's velocity in S')?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me try to write the velocity addition formula correctly.\n\nThe velocity addition formula says that if an object has velocity u in frame S, then in frame S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S (in the same direction as the positive x-axis), the object's velocity u' is:\n\nu' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v) / c\u00b2 )\n\nIn this problem, from the ejecta's frame S', the galaxy (S) is moving at u' = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So u' is +60,000 km/s (if positive is towards the ejecta). But in the galaxy's frame S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u = -v (since it's moving towards the galaxy). So u is negative, and v is the speed of S' relative to S. Since S' is moving towards the galaxy, the velocity v of S' relative to S is -v (if positive is away from the galaxy). Or wait, perhaps I should think that S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. Let me clarify.\n\nIf in S (galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy (i.e., in the negative x-direction) at speed v, then the velocity of S' (ejecta frame) relative to S is v = -v_e, where v_e is the speed of the ejecta in S.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Let me try a different approach. Let me assign variables properly.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- In the galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at velocity v. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is u = -v (assuming the positive direction is away from the galaxy).\n\n- The ejecta's frame (S') is moving at velocity v relative to S. So in S, S' is moving at velocity v (but wait, that's the same as the ejecta's velocity, which is -v. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, no. The ejecta is moving at velocity u = -v in S. So the frame S' (ejecta) is moving at velocity v_e = -v relative to S. Because if the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v, then S' is moving in the negative direction at velocity v.\n\nWait, no, no, I think I'm getting the direction wrong. Let me think: if the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy (at rest in S), then in S, the ejecta's velocity is u = -v. So the frame S' (ejecta) is moving at velocity v = -v in S? Or is it v = +v? Hmm, perhaps it's better to think that in S, the ejecta moves at velocity u = -v. So the frame S' is moving at velocity v' = -v relative to S. So to find the velocity of the galaxy (which is at rest in S) as observed from S', we can use the velocity addition formula.\n\nThe velocity of the galaxy in S' is u' = (u_galaxy_in_S - v') / (1 - (u_galaxy_in_S * v') / c\u00b2 )\n\nBut in S, the galaxy is at rest, so u_galaxy_in_S = 0. So:\n\nu' = (0 - v') / (1 - 0) ) = -v' / 1 = -v'\n\nBut according to the problem, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So u' = +60,000 km/s (since the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, which is at rest in S').\n\nSo:\n\nu' = -v' = 60,000 km/s \u2192 v' = -60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, wait. Because in this calculation, u' is the velocity of the galaxy as seen from S', and it's given as +60,000 km/s (approaching). So:\n\nu' = -v' \u2192 60,000 = -v' \u2192 v' = -60,000 km/s.\n\nBut v' is the velocity of S' relative to S. So S' is moving at v' = -60,000 km/s relative to S. That is, in S, the ejecta (S') is moving at -60,000 km/s. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is u = -60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, that seems to be the case. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but wait. Because in the problem, from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So according to the velocity addition, the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s. But let me think again: if the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at u' = 60,000 km/s in the ejecta's frame, then according to the velocity addition formula, the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame should be less than 60,000 km/s due to relativistic effects, but wait, that's only when the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Wait, 60,000 km/s is 0.2c (since c \u2248 3e5 km/s), so 60,000 is 0.2 * 3e5 = 6e4 km/s. So 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2, so v = 0.2c. So relativistic effects are present but perhaps not dominant.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the velocity addition. Let me re-express the velocity addition formula correctly. The formula is:\n\nu' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v) / c\u00b2 )\n\nwhere u is the object's velocity in S, and v is the velocity of S' relative to S.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think that if S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity of an object in S' is given by:\n\nu' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v) / c\u00b2 )\n\nSo in this case, the object is the galaxy, which is at rest in S (u = 0). So u' (galaxy's velocity in S') is:\n\nu' = (0 - v) / (1 - (0 * v)/c\u00b2 ) \u2192 u' = -v / 1 = -v.\n\nBut the problem states that from S', the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So u' = +60,000 km/s (since positive is towards the ejecta, which is the same as the direction of motion of the ejecta in S).\n\nSo:\n\nu' = -v = 60,000 km/s \u2192 v = -60,000 km/s.\n\nSo in S, the ejecta is moving at u = -60,000 km/s (since v is the velocity of S' relative to S, which is the same as the ejecta's velocity in S).\n\nWait, that can't be right because the velocity of S' relative to S is v = -60,000 km/s. So in S, the ejecta (S') is moving at v = -60,000 km/s, meaning it's moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo that makes sense. So the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame.\n\nBut wait, the question is: what distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. We need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, so we need to relate the time in the ejecta's frame to the time in the galaxy's frame. Because time dilation occurs between the frames.\n\nSo first, let's find the time that passes in the galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nThe time dilation factor is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), where v is the relative velocity between the frames. Since v is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c, let's compute gamma.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.0206.\n\nTime dilation: the time in the galaxy's frame (t) is t = gamma * t', where t' is the time in the ejecta's frame.\n\nSo t = 1.0206 * 50 s \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame for approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame is d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's pretty close.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately.\n\nLet me compute gamma again.\n\nv = 0.2c \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.04.\n\nSo 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = approximately 0.979795897.\n\nSo gamma = 1 / 0.979795897 \u2248 1.020622.\n\nSo t = 50 * 1.020622 \u2248 51.0311 seconds.\n\nThen, d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.0311 s \u2248 3,061,866 km.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nSo 3,061,866 is very close to option D, which is 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So t' = 50 s.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame, the time is t = gamma * t' = 50 * gamma.\n\nBut the distance the ejecta moves in the galaxy's frame is v * t, because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v in the galaxy's frame. So in that frame, during time t, it covers distance d = v * t.\n\nBut I'm using t = gamma * t' to find the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than in the ejecta's frame. So yes, the calculation seems correct.\n\nBut wait another thing: in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the distance between the ejecta and the galaxy's center in the ejecta's frame would be closing at 60,000 km/s.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the frames. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy.\n\nThe time in the galaxy's frame is longer than the time in the ejecta's frame because of time dilation. So t = gamma * t' = 50 * gamma \u2248 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 s.\n\nSo the distance is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 3,061,800 km. Which is approximately 3,060,000 km, matching option D.\n\nWait, but why is the answer not 3,000,000 km (option B)? Because 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But because of time dilation, the time is longer, so the distance is more than 3 million km. So the correct answer must be option D: 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 0.2c \u2192 (v/c) = 0.2.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / (sqrt(96/100)) ) = 1/( (4 * sqrt(6)) / 10 ) ) = 10/(4 * 2.4495) \u2248 10/(9.798) \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo yes, gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nt = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 s.\n\nd = 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km. Rounded to the nearest 100,000, that's approximately 3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore relativistic effects and treat the velocity as classical, which would give 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km, option B. But the problem states that both frames are inertial, implying that we need to account for relativity, but perhaps the problem expects a non-relativistic approach. But the velocity is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c, so relativistic effects are noticeable, especially time dilation.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"the ejecta part is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference.\"\n\nSo, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v. The time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So the distance in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame, which is t = gamma * t'.\n\nThus, the calculation as before.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option D: 3,060,000 km.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe question says that a supernova occurred in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, wait. So the frames are moving relative to each other. The galaxy is the rest frame, and the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy. But from the ejecta's perspective, the galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So that makes sense because if the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v, then in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, and vice versa. But wait, maybe there's a consideration of relative velocity here. Oh, right! Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly; there's the velocity addition formula to consider. But wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe we can treat this as a simple relative velocity problem without considering acceleration due to gravity or anything else.\n\nWait, but the problem is about how much distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during a certain time measured in the ejecta's frame. So I think this is a problem involving time dilation and length contraction, or maybe just relative velocity. But wait, let me think about the frames.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame (let's call it S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v. So the ejecta's frame (S') is moving at velocity v relative to S. But from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in S', the velocity of S (galaxy) is u = -v (since they're moving towards each other). Wait, no, according to the problem statement, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the velocity u of S (galaxy) as seen from S' (ejecta) is +60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. But in reality, the velocity of S' relative to S is v. So according to the velocity addition formula, the velocity u of S as seen from S' is u = (v - 0) / (1 + (v*0)/c\u00b2), but wait, wait. Maybe I'm mixing up the direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the two frames moving towards each other. If the galaxy's center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame, then from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy. Because when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed in each frame is the same, right? Wait, no, that's only in classical mechanics. In relativity, velocities don't just add like that.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the velocity addition formula. Let me recall it. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c\u00b2), where u is the velocity of an object in frame S (galaxy frame), and u' is the velocity in frame S' (ejecta frame), which is moving at velocity v relative to S.\n\nWait, no, I think I have the formula backwards. The velocity of an object in S as seen from S' is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c\u00b2)). Or maybe it's u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)), depending on the direction.\n\nWait, let me get the direction right. Let's assume that in the galaxy frame S, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at velocity v. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is u = -v (if we take the positive direction as away from the galaxy). So in S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S (since in S the ejecta is moving at v), the velocity u' of the galaxy (which is at rest in S) would be calculated using the velocity addition formula.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So u' is 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So u' = +60,000 km/s (if positive is towards the ejecta, which is moving towards the galaxy in S).\n\nWait, so applying the velocity addition formula. Let me set up the variables:\n\nIn S (galaxy frame), the ejecta's velocity is u = -v (since it's moving towards the galaxy, which is at rest in S). So the velocity of the galaxy in S' (ejecta's frame) would be u' = (u + v') / (1 + (u v')/c\u00b2), but I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that in S', the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so u' = 60,000 km/s (towards the ejecta). But according to the velocity addition formula, u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nWait, no. Let me get the direction correct. Let's define the positive direction as the direction the ejecta is moving in S (galaxy frame). So in S, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy, which is at rest in S. So the velocity of the ejecta in S is u = -v (because it's moving towards the galaxy, which is at rest in S).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So from S' (ejecta), the galaxy's velocity is u' = +60,000 km/s (since it's moving towards the ejecta). Now, what is the velocity of the galaxy in the S frame (galaxy's frame)?\n\nWait, the galaxy is at rest in its own frame, S. So in S, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at some speed v. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is u = -v (if we take the positive direction as away from the galaxy). Then, using the velocity addition formula, what is u' (galaxy's velocity in S')?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me try to write the velocity addition formula correctly.\n\nThe velocity addition formula says that if an object has velocity u in frame S, then in frame S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S (in the same direction as the positive x-axis), the object's velocity u' is:\n\nu' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v) / c\u00b2 )\n\nIn this problem, from the ejecta's frame S', the galaxy (S) is moving at u' = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So u' is +60,000 km/s (if positive is towards the ejecta). But in the galaxy's frame S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u = -v (since it's moving towards the galaxy). So u is negative, and v is the speed of S' relative to S. Since S' is moving towards the galaxy, the velocity v of S' relative to S is -v (if positive is away from the galaxy). Or wait, perhaps I should think that S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. Let me clarify.\n\nIf in S (galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy (i.e., in the negative x-direction) at speed v, then the velocity of S' (ejecta frame) relative to S is v = -v_e, where v_e is the speed of the ejecta in S.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Let me try a different approach. Let me assign variables properly.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- In the galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at velocity v. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is u = -v (assuming the positive direction is away from the galaxy).\n\n- The ejecta's frame (S') is moving at velocity v relative to S. So in S, S' is moving at velocity v (but wait, that's the same as the ejecta's velocity, which is -v. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, no. The ejecta is moving at velocity u = -v in S. So the frame S' (ejecta) is moving at velocity v_e = -v relative to S. Because if the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v, then S' is moving in the negative direction at velocity v.\n\nWait, no, no, I think I'm getting the direction wrong. Let me think: if the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy (at rest in S), then in S, the ejecta's velocity is u = -v. So the frame S' (ejecta) is moving at velocity v = -v in S? Or is it v = +v? Hmm, perhaps it's better to think that in S, the ejecta moves at velocity u = -v. So the frame S' is moving at velocity v' = -v relative to S. So to find the velocity of the galaxy (which is at rest in S) as observed from S', we can use the velocity addition formula.\n\nThe velocity of the galaxy in S' is u' = (u_galaxy_in_S - v') / (1 - (u_galaxy_in_S * v') / c\u00b2 )\n\nBut in S, the galaxy is at rest, so u_galaxy_in_S = 0. So:\n\nu' = (0 - v') / (1 - 0) ) = -v' / 1 = -v'\n\nBut according to the problem, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So u' = +60,000 km/s (since the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, which is at rest in S').\n\nSo:\n\nu' = -v' = 60,000 km/s \u2192 v' = -60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, wait. Because in this calculation, u' is the velocity of the galaxy as seen from S', and it's given as +60,000 km/s (approaching). So:\n\nu' = -v' \u2192 60,000 = -v' \u2192 v' = -60,000 km/s.\n\nBut v' is the velocity of S' relative to S. So S' is moving at v' = -60,000 km/s relative to S. That is, in S, the ejecta (S') is moving at -60,000 km/s. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is u = -60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, that seems to be the case. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but wait. Because in the problem, from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So according to the velocity addition, the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s. But let me think again: if the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at u' = 60,000 km/s in the ejecta's frame, then according to the velocity addition formula, the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame should be less than 60,000 km/s due to relativistic effects, but wait, that's only when the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Wait, 60,000 km/s is 0.2c (since c \u2248 3e5 km/s), so 60,000 is 0.2 * 3e5 = 6e4 km/s. So 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2, so v = 0.2c. So relativistic effects are present but perhaps not dominant.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the velocity addition. Let me re-express the velocity addition formula correctly. The formula is:\n\nu' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v) / c\u00b2 )\n\nwhere u is the object's velocity in S, and v is the velocity of S' relative to S.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think that if S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity of an object in S' is given by:\n\nu' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v) / c\u00b2 )\n\nSo in this case, the object is the galaxy, which is at rest in S (u = 0). So u' (galaxy's velocity in S') is:\n\nu' = (0 - v) / (1 - (0 * v)/c\u00b2 ) \u2192 u' = -v / 1 = -v.\n\nBut the problem states that from S', the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So u' = +60,000 km/s (since positive is towards the ejecta, which is the same as the direction of motion of the ejecta in S).\n\nSo:\n\nu' = -v = 60,000 km/s \u2192 v = -60,000 km/s.\n\nSo in S, the ejecta is moving at u = -60,000 km/s (since v is the velocity of S' relative to S, which is the same as the ejecta's velocity in S).\n\nWait, that can't be right because the velocity of S' relative to S is v = -60,000 km/s. So in S, the ejecta (S') is moving at v = -60,000 km/s, meaning it's moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo that makes sense. So the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame.\n\nBut wait, the question is: what distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. We need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, so we need to relate the time in the ejecta's frame to the time in the galaxy's frame. Because time dilation occurs between the frames.\n\nSo first, let's find the time that passes in the galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nThe time dilation factor is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), where v is the relative velocity between the frames. Since v is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c, let's compute gamma.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.0206.\n\nTime dilation: the time in the galaxy's frame (t) is t = gamma * t', where t' is the time in the ejecta's frame.\n\nSo t = 1.0206 * 50 s \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame for approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame is d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's pretty close.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately.\n\nLet me compute gamma again.\n\nv = 0.2c \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.04.\n\nSo 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = approximately 0.979795897.\n\nSo gamma = 1 / 0.979795897 \u2248 1.020622.\n\nSo t = 50 * 1.020622 \u2248 51.0311 seconds.\n\nThen, d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.0311 s \u2248 3,061,866 km.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nSo 3,061,866 is very close to option D, which is 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So t' = 50 s.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame, the time is t = gamma * t' = 50 * gamma.\n\nBut the distance the ejecta moves in the galaxy's frame is v * t, because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v in the galaxy's frame. So in that frame, during time t, it covers distance d = v * t.\n\nBut I'm using t = gamma * t' to find the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than in the ejecta's frame. So yes, the calculation seems correct.\n\nBut wait another thing: in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s.

So t = gamma * t' = 50 * gamma \u2248 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 s.\n\nSo the distance is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 3,061,800 km. Which is approximately 3,060,000 km, matching option D.\n\nWait, but why is the answer not 3,000,000 km (option B)? Because 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But because of time dilation, the time is longer, so the distance is more than 3 million km. So the correct answer must be option D: 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 0.2c \u2192 (v/c) = 0.2.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / (sqrt(96/100)) ) = 1/( (4 * sqrt(6)) / 10 ) ) = 10/(4 * 2.4495) \u2248 10/(9.798) \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo yes, gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nt = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 s.\n\nd = 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km.

So the distance in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame, which is t = gamma * t'.\n\nThus, the calculation as before.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option D: 3,060,000 km.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at a velocity of \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) in the galaxy's frame.

Due to relativistic effects, time dilation must be considered.\n\n### Step 1: Time Dilation\nThe time dilation factor is given by the Lorentz factor:\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\\]\nwhere \\( v = 0.2c \\) (since \\( 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} = 0.2 \\times 300,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\)). Substituting:\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206\n\\]\nThe time in the galaxy's frame is related to the time in the ejecta's frame by:\n\\[\nt = \\gamma t'\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( t' = 50 \\, \\text{s} \\) and \\( \\gamma \\approx 1.0206 \\):\n\\[\nt = 1.0206 \\times 50 \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame\nThe distance traveled by the ejecta in the galaxy's frame is:\n\\[\nd = v \\cdot t\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( t \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s} \\):\n\\[\nd = 60,000 \\times 51.03 \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km}\n\\]\nRounding to the nearest 100,000 km, this gives:\n\\[\nd \\approx 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame is approximately \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\), which corresponds to **Option D**.\n\nANSWER: D",
