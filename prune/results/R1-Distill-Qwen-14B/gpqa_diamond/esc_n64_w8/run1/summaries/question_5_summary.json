      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with angular momentum operators, the components like P_x, P_y, and P_z are involved. The operator P is given in terms of its components. The eigenvector we're looking for corresponds to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the eigenvector should depend on the angle \u03b8, I suppose.\n\nWait, the operator P is a vector operator, so the total operator P is the vector sum of its components: P = P_x \u03c3_x + P_y \u03c3_y + P_z \u03c3_z, where \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices. Each component is given as (\u0127/2) times a matrix. Let me write them down.\n\nP_x is (\u0127/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nP_y is (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\nP_z is (\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSo the total operator P along direction n is given by the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices. So if n is in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), right? Because in spherical coordinates, the polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis, so the direction vector would be (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). But since it's in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is zero, so the direction is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Wait, no, wait: in x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0, so the direction is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), yes.\n\nSo the operator P along n is P\u00b7n = (sin\u03b8) P_x + (cos\u03b8) P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero. So substituting, P\u00b7n = (\u0127/2) [ sin\u03b8 [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].\n\nLet me compute that matrix. The first term is sin\u03b8 times [[0,1],[1,0]], so it's [[0, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, 0]]. The second term is cos\u03b8 times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, -cos\u03b8]]. Adding these together, the matrix becomes:\n\n[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nBut wait, no: the diagonal elements are cos\u03b8 (from first element) and -cos\u03b8 (from second element). The off-diagonal elements are sin\u03b8 and sin\u03b8.\n\nSo the operator P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) times this matrix. So the matrix part is [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]].\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2. The eigenvalue equation is (P\u00b7n |\u03c8> ) = (+\u0127/2) |\u03c8>.\n\nLet me denote the matrix as M = [[a, b],[c, d]], where a = cos\u03b8, b = sin\u03b8, c = sin\u03b8, d = -cos\u03b8. Then M |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>.\n\nWait, but the entire operator is (\u0127/2) M, so ( (\u0127/2) M ) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) \u03bb |\u03c8>, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue of M. So for the eigenvalue equation, M |\u03c8> = \u03bb |\u03c8>, and the overall operator's eigenvalue is (\u0127/2) \u03bb. Since we want this to be +\u0127/2, then \u03bb must be +1.\n\nSo we need to find the eigenvector of M corresponding to eigenvalue \u03bb = +1.\n\nSo the matrix M is [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]. Let's find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(M - \u03bb I) = 0. So for \u03bb=1, the equation is:\n\n|cos\u03b8 -1   sin\u03b8      | = 0\n|sin\u03b8      -cos\u03b8 -1  |\n\nCalculating the determinant: (cos\u03b8 -1)(-cos\u03b8 -1) - (sin\u03b8)^2 = 0.\n\nExpanding this: [(-cos\u03b8)(cos\u03b8 -1) -1*(cos\u03b8 -1)] - (sin\u03b8)^2.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute (cos\u03b8 -1)(-cos\u03b8 -1) = (-cos\u03b8)(cos\u03b8 -1) -1*(cos\u03b8 -1) = (-cos\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u03b8) - (cos\u03b8 -1) = (-cos\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 +1) = (-cos\u00b2\u03b8 +1) = (1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8) = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo the determinant becomes sin\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 0. Which is zero. So yes, \u03bb=1 is an eigenvalue.\n\nNow, to find the eigenvector, we solve (M - I) |v> = 0.\n\nM - I is [[cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1]].\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\nsin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1) v2 = 0\n\nThese should be linearly dependent, so we can take the first equation.\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0.\n\nLet me write this as (cos\u03b8 -1) v1 = - sin\u03b8 v2.\n\nSo v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 ] v1.\n\nWe can express the eigenvector as [v1, v2] = v1 [1, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ].\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to express in terms of an angle. Let me note that (1 - cos\u03b8) = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] ] = [ sin(\u03b8/2) ] / [ cos(\u03b8/2) ] = tan(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [1, tan(\u03b8/2)] up to a scalar multiple.\n\nWe can factor out cos(\u03b8/2) to make it look neater. Let me see: [1, tan(\u03b8/2)] = [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)].\n\nBecause:\n\ntan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2), so [1, tan(\u03b8/2)] = [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)] / cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If v1 is cos(\u03b8/2), then v2 is sin(\u03b8/2). Because tan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2). So yes, the eigenvector is proportional to [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)].\n\nBut wait, I need to check the signs. Let me compute [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)].\n\nWait, another approach: the eigenvalue equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of spherical harmonics or spin states.\n\nWait, in spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates of the spin in direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) are given by |+> = cos(\u03b8/2) |\u2191> + e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) |\u2193>.\n\nBut in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, \u03c6=0, so e^{i\u03c6}=1. So the eigenstate is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nWait, but that's assuming that the operator is the spin in direction \u03b8, which aligns with what we're doing here.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nBut wait, I should verify this. Let me plug this into the eigenvalue equation.\n\nThe matrix M is [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]].\n\nSo M times [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ] should equal [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nCompute the first component:\n\ncos\u03b8 * cos(\u03b8/2) + sin\u03b8 * sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nUsing the identity cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. So A is \u03b8, B is \u03b8/2. So cos\u03b8 cos(\u03b8/2) + sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nWait, wait, let me compute this: cos\u03b8 cos(\u03b8/2) + sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8 - \u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2). So yes, the first component is cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nThe second component:\n\nsin\u03b8 * cos(\u03b8/2) + (-cos\u03b8) * sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nWhich is sin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8/2) - cos\u03b8 sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nUsing sin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB. So sin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8/2) - cos\u03b8 sin(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8 - \u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo yes, M [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ] = [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ], so the vector is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. That checks out.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ] up to normalization. Since the question asks for the normalized eigenvector, we need to check if this vector is already normalized.\n\nCompute the norm: cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1. So yes, it's already normalized.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The operator P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) M. So the eigenvalue is (\u0127/2) * 1 = \u0127/2, which matches the given condition. So the eigenvector is correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which matches. Option B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8), but that's for a general spherical coordinate system, not necessarily \u03b8/2. Option D seems to mix terms with sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which doesn't match. Option A has \u0127 in the elements, but the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector, so the options with \u0127 (like A and D) can't be correct. Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are dimensionless; the \u0127 would be part of the operator, not the state.\n\nWait, that's a good point. The eigenvector elements should be dimensionless, so any option with \u0127 in them (like options A and D) is probably incorrect.\n\nSo looking back, option C is the correct normalized eigenvector. The other options either have the wrong form or include \u0127, which doesn't belong in the state vector.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with angular momentum operators, the components like P_x, P_y, and P_z are involved. The operator P is given in terms of its components. The eigenvector we're looking for corresponds to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the eigenvector should depend on the angle \u03b8, I suppose.\n\nWait, the operator P is a vector operator, so the total operator P is the vector sum of its components: P = P_x \u03c3_x + P_y \u03c3_y + P_z \u03c3_z, where \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices. Each component is given as (\u0127/2) times a matrix. Let me write them down.\n\nP_x is (\u0127/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nP_y is (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\nP_z is (\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSo the total operator P along direction n is given by the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices. So if n is in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), right? Because in spherical coordinates, the polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis, so the direction vector would be (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). But since it's in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is zero, so the direction is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Wait, no, wait: in x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0, so the direction is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), yes.\n\nSo the operator P along n is P\u00b7n = (sin\u03b8) P_x + (cos\u03b8) P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero. So substituting, P\u00b7n = (\u0127/2) [ sin\u03b8 [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].\n\nLet me compute that matrix. The first term is sin\u03b8 times [[0,1],[1,0]], so it's [[0, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, 0]]. The second term is cos\u03b8 times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, -cos\u03b8]]. Adding these together, the matrix becomes:\n\n[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nBut wait, no: the diagonal elements are cos\u03b8 (from first element) and -cos\u03b8 (from second element). The off-diagonal elements are sin\u03b8 and sin\u03b8.\n\nSo the operator P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) times this matrix. So the matrix part is [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]].\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2. The eigenvalue equation is (P\u00b7n |\u03c8> ) = (+\u0127/2) |\u03c8>.\n\nLet me denote the matrix as M = [[a, b],[c, d]], where a = cos\u03b8, b = sin\u03b8, c = sin\u03b8, d = -cos\u03b8. Then M |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>.\n\nWait, but the entire operator is (\u0127/2) M, so ( (\u0127/2) M ) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) \u03bb |\u03c8>, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue of M. So for the eigenvalue equation, M |\u03c8> = \u03bb |\u03c8>, and the overall operator's eigenvalue is (\u0127/2) \u03bb. Since we want this to be +\u0127/2, then \u03bb must be +1.\n\nSo we need to find the eigenvector of M corresponding to eigenvalue \u03bb = +1.\n\nSo the matrix M is [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]. Let's find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(M - \u03bb I) = 0. So for \u03bb=1, the equation is:\n\n|cos\u03b8 -1   sin\u03b8      | = 0\n|sin\u03b8      -cos\u03b8 -1  |\n\nCalculating the determinant: (cos\u03b8 -1)(-cos\u03b8 -1) - (sin\u03b8)^2 = 0.\n\nExpanding this: [(-cos\u03b8)(cos\u03b8 -1) -1*(cos\u03b8 -1)] - (sin\u03b8)^2.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute (cos\u03b8 -1)(-cos\u03b8 -1) = (-cos\u03b8)(cos\u03b8 -1) -1*(cos\u03b8 -1) = (-cos\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u03b8) - (cos\u03b8 -1) = (-cos\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 +1) = (-cos\u00b2\u03b8 +1) = (1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8) = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo the determinant becomes sin\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 0. Which is zero. So yes, \u03bb=1 is an eigenvalue.\n\nNow, to find the eigenvector, we solve (M - I) |v> = 0.\n\nM - I is [[cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1]].\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\nsin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1) v2 = 0\n\nThese should be linearly dependent, so we can take the first equation.\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0.\n\nLet me write this as (cos\u03b8 -1) v1 = - sin\u03b8 v2.\n\nSo v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 ] v1.\n\nWe can express the eigenvector as [v1, v2] = v1 [1, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ].\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to express in terms of an angle. Let me note that (1 - cos\u03b8) = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] ] = [ sin(\u03b8/2) ] / [ cos(\u03b8/2) ] = tan(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [1, tan(\u03b8/2)] up to a scalar multiple.\n\nWe can factor out cos(\u03b8/2) to make it look neater. Let me see: [1, tan(\u03b8/2)] = [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)].\n\nBecause:\n\ntan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2), so [1, tan(\u03b8/2)] = [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)] / cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If v1 is cos(\u03b8/2), then v2 is sin(\u03b8/2). Because tan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2). So yes, the eigenvector is proportional to [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)].\n\nBut wait, I need to check the signs. Let me compute [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)].\n\nWait, another approach: the eigenvalue equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of spherical harmonics or spin states.\n\nWait, in spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates of the spin in direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) are given by |+> = cos(\u03b8/2) |\u2191> + e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) |\u2193>.\n\nBut in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, \u03c6=0, so e^{i\u03c6}=1. So the eigenstate is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nWait, but that's assuming that the operator is the spin in direction \u03b8, which aligns with what we're doing here.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nBut wait, I should verify this. Let me plug this into the eigenvalue equation.\n\nThe matrix M is [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]].\n\nSo M times [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ] should equal [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nCompute the first component:\n\ncos\u03b8 * cos(\u03b8/2) + sin\u03b8 * sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nUsing the identity cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. So A is \u03b8, B is \u03b8/2. So cos\u03b8 cos(\u03b8/2) + sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nWait, wait, let me compute this: cos\u03b8 cos(\u03b8/2) + sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8 - \u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2). So yes, the first component is cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nThe second component:\n\nsin\u03b8 * cos(\u03b8/2) + (-cos\u03b8) * sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nWhich is sin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8/2) - cos\u03b8 sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nUsing sin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB. So sin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8/2) - cos\u03b8 sin(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8 - \u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo yes, M [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ] = [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ], so the vector is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. That checks out.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ] up to normalization. Since the question asks for the normalized eigenvector, we need to check if this vector is already normalized.\n\nCompute the norm: cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1. So yes, it's already normalized.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The operator P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) M. So the eigenvalue is (\u0127/2) * 1 = \u0127/2, which matches the given condition. So the eigenvector is correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which matches. Option B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8), but that's for a general spherical coordinate system, not necessarily \u03b8/2. Option D seems to mix terms with sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which doesn't match. Option A has \u0127 in the elements, but the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector, so the options with \u0127 (like A and D) can't be correct. Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are dimensionless; the \u0127 would be part of the operator, not the state.\n\nWait, that's a good point. The eigenvector elements should be dimensionless, so any option with \u0127 in them (like options A and D) is probably incorrect.\n\nSo looking back, option C is the correct normalized eigenvector. The other options either have the wrong form or include \u0127, which doesn't belong in the state vector.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \\times 2$ matrices. The direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be represented as $(\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.\n\n### Step 1: Construct the operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$\nThe operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ is constructed as a linear combination of the components:\n\\[\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\sin\\theta P_x + \\cos\\theta P_z.\n\\]\nSubstituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n\\[\nP_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix},\n\\]\nwe find:\n\\[\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation\nThe eigenvalue equation is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\right) | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} | \\psi \\rangle.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to finding the eigenvector of the matrix:\n\\[\nM = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{bmatrix},\n\\]\ncorresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +1$. Solving $(M - I)|v\\rangle = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix, leads to the eigenvector:\n\\[\n|v\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector\nThe eigenvector is already normalized because:\n\\[\n\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the options\n- **Option A**: Includes $\\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.\n- **Option B**: Represents a general spherical coordinate form but does not match the derived eigenvector.\n- **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $\\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- **Option D**: Includes $\\hbar$ and additional factors that do not align with the derived eigenvector.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **Option C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each represented by 2x2 matrices multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nWait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it's P = P_x X + P_y Y + P_z Z. But the problem says the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the operator along direction n would be something like P\u00b7n, I think. Oh wait, no, the problem is to find the eigenvector for the operator along n. So I need to construct the operator P_n = (P\u00b7n) and find its eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nHmm, right. Because the direction n is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, it can be parametrized using an angle \u03b8 from the z-axis. So n would have components (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) or something like that. Wait, in spherical coordinates, yeah. So n = (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). But since it's in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is zero. So n = (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). So the components would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8).\n\nSo the operator P_n is P\u00b7n = P_x sin\u03b8 + P_z cos\u03b8. Because the Y-component's coefficient is zero.\n\nWait, but wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so each component is given. So P_x is given by (\u0127/2) times a matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], P_y is (\u0127/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], and P_z is (\u0127/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nSo P_n would be (\u0127/2) [ sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].\n\nLet me compute that matrix. The sin\u03b8 term adds the 0 1; 1 0 matrix multiplied by sin\u03b8, and the cos\u03b8 term adds 1 0; 0 -1 multiplied by cos\u03b8.\n\nSo combining these, the matrix becomes:\n\nTop left: cos\u03b8 * 1 = cos\u03b8\nTop right: sin\u03b8 * 1 = sin\u03b8\nBottom left: sin\u03b8 *1 = sin\u03b8\nBottom right: (-1)*cos\u03b8 *1 = -cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the matrix for P_n is (\u0127/2) multiplied by [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]].\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, the matrix for P_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when you take P_x * sin\u03b8 + P_z * cos\u03b8, each component is scaled and added.\n\nSo for the (1,1) element: (P_x's 0 * sin\u03b8) + (P_z's 1 * cos\u03b8) = cos\u03b8.\n\n(1,2) element: P_x's 1 * sin\u03b8 + P_z's 0 * cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8.\n\n(2,1) element: same as (1,2) because the matrix is symmetric in this case, so sin\u03b8.\n\n(2,2) element: P_x's 0 * sin\u03b8 + P_z's (-1)*cos\u03b8 = -cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the matrix is [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]], multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nSo P_n = (\u0127/2) * [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]].\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector for this matrix with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Because the eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2.\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is (P_n - (\u0127/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.\n\nSo the matrix (P_n - (\u0127/2) I) would be:\n\n(\u0127/2) [[cos\u03b8 - 1, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1]]\n\nWait, no. Wait, P_n is (\u0127/2) times the matrix. So when we subtract (\u0127/2) I, the matrix becomes:\n\n(\u0127/2)*[ [ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ] ] - (\u0127/2)*[ [1, 0], [0,1] ].\n\nSo each element is:\n\n(\u0127/2)(cos\u03b8 - 1) for (1,1), (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 for (1,2), (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 for (2,1), and (\u0127/2)(-cos\u03b8 -1) for (2,2).\n\nBut since we're looking for eigenvectors, the equations come from the determinant of (P_n - (\u0127/2) I) being zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the matrix without the \u0127/2 factor. Because when you factor out \u0127/2, you can factor it out of the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write the eigenvalue equation as:\n\nP_n |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n(\u0127/2) [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]] * [a; b] = (\u0127/2) [a; b]\n\nWe can divide both sides by (\u0127/2), so:\n\n[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]] [a; b] = [a; b]\n\nWhich gives us the system:\n\na cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 = a\n\na sin\u03b8 + b (-cos\u03b8) = b\n\nSo, rearranging the first equation:\n\na (cos\u03b8 - 1) + b sin\u03b8 = 0\n\nSecond equation:\n\na sin\u03b8 - b (cos\u03b8 + 1) = 0\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) a (cos\u03b8 -1) + b sin\u03b8 = 0\n\n2) a sin\u03b8 - b (cos\u03b8 +1) = 0\n\nWe can write these as:\n\nEquation 1: a (1 - cos\u03b8) = b sin\u03b8\n\nEquation 2: a sin\u03b8 = b (1 + cos\u03b8)\n\nHmm. Let me see. Let me take equation 1:\n\na (1 - cos\u03b8) = b sin\u03b8 \u2192 equation 1.\n\nEquation 2:\n\na sin\u03b8 = b (1 + cos\u03b8) \u2192 equation 2.\n\nWe can solve for a in terms of b from equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 1: a = [b sin\u03b8] / (1 - cos\u03b8)\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: a = [b (1 + cos\u03b8)] / sin\u03b8\n\nSince both expressions equal a, set them equal:\n\n[b sin\u03b8] / (1 - cos\u03b8) = [b (1 + cos\u03b8)] / sin\u03b8\n\nAssuming b \u2260 0 (otherwise trivial solution), we can cancel b:\n\nsin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8) = (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - cos\u03b8) sin\u03b8:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 = (1 + cos\u03b8)(1 - cos\u03b8) \u2192 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8\n\nWhich is true since sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo the two equations are consistent. So we can choose one equation to express a in terms of b.\n\nLet's take equation 2: a sin\u03b8 = b (1 + cos\u03b8)\n\nSo a = [b (1 + cos\u03b8)] / sin\u03b8\n\nBut let's see if we can express the eigenvector in terms of a parameter.\n\nLet me set b as a parameter, say b = 1 for simplicity, and then find a.\n\nBut wait, the eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar multiple. So let's let b = 1. Then a = (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to express it in terms of sine and cosine.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: using trigonometric identities.\n\nWe know that (1 + cos\u03b8) = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo substituting into a:\n\na = [2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] ] = [ cos(\u03b8/2) ] / [ sin(\u03b8/2) ] = cot(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo a = cot(\u03b8/2) and b=1.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [a; b] = [cot(\u03b8/2), 1]^T.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, if I set b=1, then a = (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich, using the identities, becomes:\n\n(1 + cos\u03b8) = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = (2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) / (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) = (cos(\u03b8/2)) / (sin(\u03b8/2)) ) = cot(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo a = cot(\u03b8/2), b=1.\n\nBut that gives us the eigenvector as [cot(\u03b8/2), 1]^T. Now, we need to normalize this vector.\n\nThe normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.\n\nSo compute |a|\u00b2 + |b|\u00b2.\n\na = cot(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo |a|^2 = [cos^2(\u03b8/2)] / [sin^2(\u03b8/2)]\n\n|b|^2 =1.\n\nSo sum is [cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] + 1 = [cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1 / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo normalization factor is sqrt(1 / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) ) = 1/|sin(\u03b8/2)|.\n\nSince \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0 (since it's in the x-z plane and direction is arbitrary), sin(\u03b8/2) is positive.\n\nSo normalization factor is 1/sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ (cot(\u03b8/2) ) * (1/sin(\u03b8/2)) ), 1 * (1/sin(\u03b8/2)) ) ]\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because the normalization factor is 1/sin(\u03b8/2), so each component is multiplied by that.\n\nWait, a = cot(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo a * (1/sin(\u03b8/2)) = [cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2)] * [1/sin(\u03b8/2)] = cos(\u03b8/2) / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2).\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute the normalization again.\n\nWait, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt( |a|^2 + |b|^2 ), because the vector [a; b] has norm sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So when I set b=1, the norm is sqrt( a\u00b2 + 1 ), and normalization factor is 1 over that.\n\nBut earlier, a\u00b2 +1 = [ (1 + cos\u03b8)^2 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] + 1.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: let's compute the norm squared of the vector [a, b]^T.\n\na = (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8, b=1.\n\nSo |a|\u00b2 + |b|\u00b2 = [ (1 + cos\u03b8)^2 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] + 1.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(1 + 2 cos\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) + sin\u00b2\u03b8 \u2192 because denominator is sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, |a|^2 is ( (1 + cos\u03b8)^2 ) / sin\u00b2\u03b8, and |b|^2 is 1.\n\nSo sum is [ (1 + 2 cos\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] / sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBecause 1 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo numerator becomes 1 + 2 cos\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 1, so numerator is 1 + 2 cos\u03b8 + 1 = 2 (1 + cos\u03b8).\n\nSo |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 2(1 + cos\u03b8) / sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nHmm, but 1 + cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2), and sin\u00b2theta = 4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSo substituting:\n\nNumerator: 2 * 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) =4 cos\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nDenominator: 4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSo [4 cos\u00b2(theta/2)] / [4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2)] ] = 1/(sin\u00b2(theta/2)).\n\nWhich brings us back to the same point as before. So the norm is 1/sin(theta/2), so the normalization factor is sin(theta/2).\n\nWait, no. The normalization factor is 1 over sqrt(1/sin^2(theta/2)) ), which is sin(theta/2).\n\nWait, the norm squared is 1/sin\u00b2(theta/2), so the norm is 1/sin(theta/2). So to normalize, we multiply each component by sin(theta/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is:\n\na = [ (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] * sin(theta/2)\n\nb = 1 * sin(theta/2)\n\nWait, let's compute a:\n\n(1 + cos\u03b8) = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2)\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)\n\nSo (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 cos\u00b2(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2)\n\nSo a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)\n\nSimilarly, b = sin(theta/2)\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nWait, that's neat. So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).\n\nBut wait, what about the phase? Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can have a phase factor. So sometimes you might see a complex exponential, but in this case, the eigenvector components are real. But let me think about the operator again.\n\nWait, the operator P_n is Hermitian because it's a component of angular momentum, which are Hermitian. So the eigenvectors can be chosen to be real, right? Because for real eigenvalues, the eigenvectors can be taken as real.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see this as one of the options. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). Oh, yes, option C.\n\nBut wait, the options have some other terms. Let me check all the options again.\n\nOption A: sqrt(2/3) \u0127 and sqrt(1/3) \u0127. Hmm, but our result is unit vectors, so that's probably not.\n\nOption B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which seems to involve spherical coordinates but maybe for a spin-1 system? Not sure.\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what we derived.\n\nOption D: sqrt(2/3) \u0127 cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) \u0127 sin(theta/2). Hmm, that looks like a scaled version, but why would there be a sqrt(2/3) factor? Unless perhaps the question is about a different operator or a normalized direction.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says the operator is for a muon. Wait, but muons have spin 1/2, so the eigenvectors would be two-dimensional. So our approach applies.\n\nWait, but the eigenvector we found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.\n\nBut let me think again. The operator is P = (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrices. So the eigenvectors are spin-up and spin-down along the direction n.\n\nThe normalized eigenvectors for spin-1/2 along an arbitrary direction (theta, phi) are given by:\n\n[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T\n\nBut in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane (so phi=0). So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo that's option C.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what we have.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each represented by 2x2 matrices multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nWait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it's P = P_x X + P_y Y + P_z Z. But the problem says the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the operator along direction n would be something like P\u00b7n, I think. Oh wait, no, the problem is to find the eigenvector for the operator along n. So I need to construct the operator P_n = (P\u00b7n) and find its eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nHmm, right. Because the direction n is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, it can be parametrized using an angle \u03b8 from the z-axis. So n would have components (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) or something like that. Wait, in spherical coordinates, yeah. So n = (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). But since it's in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is zero. So n = (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). So the components would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8).\n\nSo the operator P_n is P\u00b7n = P_x sin\u03b8 + P_z cos\u03b8. Because the Y-component's coefficient is zero.\n\nWait, but wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so each component is given. So P_x is given by (\u0127/2) times a matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], P_y is (\u0127/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], and P_z is (\u0127/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nSo P_n would be (\u0127/2) [ sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].\n\nLet me compute that matrix. The sin\u03b8 term adds the 0 1; 1 0 matrix multiplied by sin\u03b8, and the cos\u03b8 term adds 1 0; 0 -1 multiplied by cos\u03b8.\n\nSo combining these, the matrix becomes:\n\nTop left: cos\u03b8 * 1 = cos\u03b8\nTop right: sin\u03b8 * 1 = sin\u03b8\nBottom left: sin\u03b8 *1 = sin\u03b8\nBottom right: (-1)*cos\u03b8 *1 = -cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the matrix for P_n is (\u0127/2) multiplied by [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]].\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, the matrix for P_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when you take P_x * sin\u03b8 + P_z * cos\u03b8, each component is scaled and added.\n\nSo for the (1,1) element: (P_x's 0 * sin\u03b8) + (P_z's 1 * cos\u03b8) = cos\u03b8.\n\n(1,2) element: P_x's 1 * sin\u03b8 + P_z's 0 * cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8.\n\n(2,1) element: same as (1,2) because the matrix is symmetric in this case, so sin\u03b8.\n\n(2,2) element: P_x's 0 * sin\u03b8 + P_z's (-1)*cos\u03b8 = -cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the matrix is [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]], multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nSo P_n = (\u0127/2) * [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]].\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector for this matrix with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Because the eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2.\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is (P_n - (\u0127/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.\n\nSo the matrix (P_n - (\u0127/2) I) would be:\n\n(\u0127/2) [[cos\u03b8 - 1, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1]]\n\nWait, no. Wait, P_n is (\u0127/2) times the matrix. So when we subtract (\u0127/2) I, the matrix becomes:\n\n(\u0127/2)*[ [ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ] ] - (\u0127/2)*[ [1, 0], [0,1] ].\n\nSo each element is:\n\n(\u0127/2)(cos\u03b8 - 1) for (1,1), (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 for (1,2), (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 for (2,1), and (\u0127/2)(-cos\u03b8 -1) for (2,2).\n\nBut since we're looking for eigenvectors, the equations come from the determinant of (P_n - (\u0127/2) I) being zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the matrix without the \u0127/2 factor. Because when you factor out \u0127/2, you can factor it out of the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write the eigenvalue equation as:\n\nP_n |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n(\u0127/2) [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]] * [a; b] = (\u0127/2) [a; b]\n\nWe can divide both sides by (\u0127/2), so:\n\n[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]] [a; b] = [a; b]\n\nWhich gives us the system:\n\na cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 = a\n\na sin\u03b8 + b (-cos\u03b8) = b\n\nSo, rearranging the first equation:\n\na (cos\u03b8 - 1) + b sin\u03b8 = 0\n\nSecond equation:\n\na sin\u03b8 - b (cos\u03b8 + 1) = 0\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) a (cos\u03b8 -1) + b sin\u03b8 = 0\n\n2) a sin\u03b8 - b (cos\u03b8 +1) = 0\n\nWe can write these as:\n\nEquation 1: a (1 - cos\u03b8) = b sin\u03b8\n\nEquation 2: a sin\u03b8 = b (1 + cos\u03b8)\n\nHmm. Let me see. Let me take equation 1:\n\na (1 - cos\u03b8) = b sin\u03b8 \u2192 equation 1.\n\nEquation 2:\n\na sin\u03b8 = b (1 + cos\u03b8) \u2192 equation 2.\n\nWe can solve for a in terms of b from equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 1: a = [b sin\u03b8] / (1 - cos\u03b8)\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: a = [b (1 + cos\u03b8)] / sin\u03b8\n\nSince both expressions equal a, set them equal:\n\n[b sin\u03b8] / (1 - cos\u03b8) = [b (1 + cos\u03b8)] / sin\u03b8\n\nAssuming b \u2260 0 (otherwise trivial solution), we can cancel b:\n\nsin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8) = (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - cos\u03b8) sin\u03b8:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 = (1 + cos\u03b8)(1 - cos\u03b8) \u2192 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8\n\nWhich is true since sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo the two equations are consistent. So we can choose one equation to express a in terms of b.\n\nLet's take equation 2: a sin\u03b8 = b (1 + cos\u03b8)\n\nSo a = [b (1 + cos\u03b8)] / sin\u03b8\n\nBut let's see if we can express the eigenvector in terms of a parameter.\n\nLet me set b as a parameter, say b = 1 for simplicity, and then find a.\n\nBut wait, the eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar multiple. So let's let b = 1. Then a = (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to express it in terms of sine and cosine.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: using trigonometric identities.\n\nWe know that (1 + cos\u03b8) = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo substituting into a:\n\na = [2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] ] = [ cos(\u03b8/2) ] / [ sin(\u03b8/2) ] = cot(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo a = cot(\u03b8/2) and b=1.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [a; b] = [cot(\u03b8/2), 1]^T.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, if I set b=1, then a = (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich, using the identities, becomes:\n\n(1 + cos\u03b8) = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = (2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) / (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) = (cos(\u03b8/2)) / (sin(\u03b8/2)) ) = cot(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo a = cot(\u03b8/2), b=1.\n\nBut that gives us the eigenvector as [cot(\u03b8/2), 1]^T. Now, we need to normalize this vector.\n\nThe normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.\n\nSo compute |a|\u00b2 + |b|\u00b2.\n\na = cot(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo |a|^2 = [cos^2(\u03b8/2)] / [sin^2(\u03b8/2)]\n\n|b|^2 =1.\n\nSo sum is [cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] + 1 = [cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1 / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo normalization factor is sqrt(1 / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) ) = 1/|sin(\u03b8/2)|.\n\nSince \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0 (since it's in the x-z plane and direction is arbitrary), sin(\u03b8/2) is positive.\n\nSo normalization factor is 1/sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ (cot(\u03b8/2) ) * (1/sin(\u03b8/2)) ), 1 * (1/sin(\u03b8/2)) ) ]\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because the normalization factor is 1/sin(\u03b8/2), so each component is multiplied by that.\n\nWait, a = cot(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo a * (1/sin(\u03b8/2)) = [cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2)] * [1/sin(\u03b8/2)] = cos(\u03b8/2) / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2).\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute the normalization again.\n\nWait, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt( |a|^2 + |b|^2 ), because the vector [a; b] has norm sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So when I set b=1, the norm is sqrt( a\u00b2 + 1 ), and normalization factor is 1 over that.\n\nBut earlier, a\u00b2 +1 = [ (1 + cos\u03b8)^2 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] + 1.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: let's compute the norm squared of the vector [a, b]^T.\n\na = (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8, b=1.\n\nSo |a|\u00b2 + |b|\u00b2 = [ (1 + cos\u03b8)^2 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] + 1.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(1 + 2 cos\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) + sin\u00b2\u03b8 \u2192 because denominator is sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, |a|^2 is ( (1 + cos\u03b8)^2 ) / sin\u00b2\u03b8, and |b|^2 is 1.\n\nSo sum is [ (1 + 2 cos\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] / sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBecause 1 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo numerator becomes 1 + 2 cos\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 1, so numerator is 1 + 2 cos\u03b8 + 1 = 2 (1 + cos\u03b8).\n\nSo |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 2(1 + cos\u03b8) / sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nHmm, but 1 + cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2), and sin\u00b2theta = 4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSo substituting:\n\nNumerator: 2 * 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) =4 cos\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nDenominator: 4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSo [4 cos\u00b2(theta/2)] / [4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2)] ] = 1/(sin\u00b2(theta/2)).\n\nWhich brings us back to the same point as before. So the norm is 1/sin(theta/2), so the normalization factor is sin(theta/2).\n\nWait, no. The normalization factor is 1 over sqrt(1/sin^2(theta/2)) ), which is sin(theta/2).\n\nWait, the norm squared is 1/sin\u00b2(theta/2), so the norm is 1/sin(theta/2). So to normalize, we multiply each component by sin(theta/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is:\n\na = [ (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] * sin(theta/2)\n\nb = 1 * sin(theta/2)\n\nWait, let's compute a:\n\n(1 + cos\u03b8) = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2)\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)\n\nSo (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 cos\u00b2(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2)\n\nSo a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)\n\nSimilarly, b = sin(theta/2)\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nWait, that's neat. So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).\n\nBut wait, what about the phase? Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can have a phase factor. So sometimes you might see a complex exponential, but in this case, the eigenvector components are real. But let me think about the operator again.\n\nWait, the operator P_n is Hermitian because it's a component of angular momentum, which are Hermitian. So the eigenvectors can be chosen to be real, right? Because for real eigenvalues, the eigenvectors can be taken as real.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see this as one of the options. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). Oh, yes, option C.\n\nBut wait, the options have some other terms. Let me check all the options again.\n\nOption A: sqrt(2/3) \u0127 and sqrt(1/3) \u0127. Hmm, but our result is unit vectors, so that's probably not.\n\nOption B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which seems to involve spherical coordinates but maybe for a spin-1 system? Not sure.\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what we derived.\n\nOption D: sqrt(2/3) \u0127 cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) \u0127 sin(theta/2). Hmm, that looks like a scaled version, but why would there be a sqrt(2/3) factor? Unless perhaps the question is about a different operator or a normalized direction.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says the operator is for a muon. Wait, but muons have spin 1/2, so the eigenvectors would be two-dimensional. So our approach applies.\n\nWait, but the eigenvector we found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.\n\nBut let me think again. The operator is P = (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrices. So the eigenvectors are spin-up and spin-down along the direction n.\n\nThe normalized eigenvectors for spin-1/2 along an arbitrary direction (theta, phi) are given by:\n\n[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T\n\nBut in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane (so phi=0). So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo that's option C.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what we have.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is constructed as $\\vec{P} = P_x \\hat{x} + P_y \\hat{y} + P_z \\hat{z}$, where the components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ are given in terms of $2 \\times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\\hbar/2$. The direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parametrized as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.\n\n### Step 1: Construct the operator $\\vec{P}_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$\nThe operator $\\vec{P}_n$ is given by:\n\\[\n\\vec{P}_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta\n\\]\nSubstituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n\\[\nP_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwe get:\n\\[\n\\vec{P}_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation\nThe eigenvalue equation is:\n\\[\n\\vec{P}_n |v\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} |v\\rangle\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFrom the first row:\n\\[\na \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a \\implies a (1 - \\cos\\theta) + b \\sin\\theta = 0\n\\]\nFrom the second row:\n\\[\na \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b \\implies a \\sin\\theta - b (1 + \\cos\\theta) = 0\n\\]\nThese equations are consistent and can be solved to express $a$ in terms of $b$:\n\\[\na = \\frac{(1 + \\cos\\theta)}{\\sin\\theta} b\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector\nThe eigenvector is proportional to:\n\\[\n|v\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{(1 + \\cos\\theta)}{\\sin\\theta} \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nUsing trigonometric identities, $(1 + \\cos\\theta) = 2\\cos^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$, we find:\n\\[\na = \\cos(\\theta/2), \\quad b = \\sin(\\theta/2)\n\\]\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\\[\n|v\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the options\n- **Option A**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ does not match the derived eigenvector.\n- **Option B**: $(\\cos\\theta, e^{i\\phi}\\sin\\theta)$ is incorrect because it corresponds to a different parametrization.\n- **Option C**: $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ matches the derived eigenvector.\n- **Option D**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin(\\theta/2))$ introduces unnecessary scaling factors.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it.\n\nThe problem says the operator is P, and it's for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +\u0127/2. Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators often correspond to observables like momentum or spin. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are involved here since the components of P are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nSo, the components are:\n\nPx = (\u0127/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nPy = (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\nPz = (\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nBut wait, the operator in question is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, so the direction is arbitrary but lies in x-z, meaning the angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis, and \u03c6 would be 0 because it's in the x-z plane, so direction is along \u03b8 in x-z. So the general operator P for a direction n would be a combination of Px, Py, and Pz.\n\nWait, the operator P is along n, so the operator is P = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, that means ny = 0. So P = nx Px + nz Pz.\n\nHmm, but what's the direction? Let's say n is a unit vector, so nx\u00b2 + nz\u00b2 = 1. Let's denote the direction by an angle \u03b8 from the z-axis, so nx = sin\u03b8, nz = cos\u03b8. So P becomes (sin\u03b8)(Px) + (cos\u03b8)(Pz).\n\nSo the operator P is (\u0127/2) [ sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]\n\nLet me compute that matrix. Let me compute each term:\n\nsin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives [[0, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, 0]]\ncos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nAdding them together:\n[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nSo the operator P is (\u0127/2) multiplied by this matrix.\n\nWe're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. So the equation is P |\u03c8> = (+\u0127/2) |\u03c8>.\n\nWhich gives (\u0127/2) * [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]] * |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>\n\nDividing both sides by \u0127/2, we get the matrix equation:\n\n[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]] * |\u03c8> = |\u03c8>\n\nSo the matrix equation is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]\n\nWhich leads to the equations:\n\ncos\u03b8 * a + sin\u03b8 * b = a\nsin\u03b8 * a - cos\u03b8 * b = b\n\nLet me rearrange each equation.\n\nFirst equation: (cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\nSecond equation: sin\u03b8 a + (-cos\u03b8 -1) b = 0\n\nHmm, these are two equations. Let me write them again:\n\n1) (cos\u03b8 - 1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n2) sin\u03b8 a + (-cos\u03b8 - 1) b = 0\n\nSince the system must have non-trivial solutions (eigenvectors), the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Let me compute the determinant of the matrix:\n\n| (cos\u03b8 -1)   sin\u03b8        |\n| sin\u03b8        (-cos\u03b8 -1)  |\n\nDeterminant D = (cos\u03b8 -1)(-cos\u03b8 -1) - (sin\u03b8)(sin\u03b8)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1)(-cos\u03b8 -1) = -(cos\u03b8)(cos\u03b8 +1) -1*(-cos\u03b8 -1) + ... Wait, maybe expanding it:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1)(-cos\u03b8 -1) = cos\u03b8*(-cos\u03b8) + cos\u03b8*(-1) -1*(-cos\u03b8) -1*(-1)\n= -cos\u00b2\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 + cos\u03b8 + 1\n= -cos\u00b2\u03b8 + 1\n\nBecause the middle terms cancel: -cos\u03b8 + cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo D = (-cos\u00b2\u03b8 + 1) - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = (1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8) - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 is sin\u00b2\u03b8, so D = sin\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 0. So yes, determinant is zero, which makes sense for eigenvectors.\n\nSo the equations are dependent, so we can use one equation to find the ratio of a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: (cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n=> (1 - cos\u03b8) a = sin\u03b8 b\n=> a = [ sin\u03b8 / (1 - cos\u03b8) ] b\n\nSimplify sin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8). I remember that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So:\n\nsin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8) = [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] ] = [ cos(\u03b8/2) ] / [ sin(\u03b8/2) ] = cot(\u03b8/2 )\n\nSo a = cot(\u03b8/2) * b\n\nAlternatively, a = [ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ] b = cot(\u03b8/2) b.\n\nSo the ratio a/b is cot(\u03b8/2). So the eigenvector can be written as [a, b] = [ cot(\u03b8/2) b, b ] = b [ cot(\u03b8/2), 1 ]\n\nWe can set b = 1 for simplicity, then a = cot(\u03b8/2), so the vector is [cot(\u03b8/2), 1]^T. But we need to normalize it.\n\nThe normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.\n\nSince a is real here (because \u03b8 is real and in the x-z plane), but wait wait, wait a minute. Wait, in this case, the operator P is a real matrix, so its eigenvectors can be real. Wait, but the original operator P is given in terms of the Pauli matrices, which are Hermitian, so P is Hermitian, so its eigenvectors are orthogonal, and can be chosen to be real if the eigenvalues are real.\n\nWait, but in this case, the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2, which is real. So the eigenvector can be real.\n\nSo the normalization is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.\n\na = cot(\u03b8/2), b = 1.\n\nSo |a|\u00b2 + |b|\u00b2 = cot\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + 1 = csc\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1/sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2). So the norm is 1/sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2).\n\nWait, so to normalize, the vector should be multiplied by sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(\u03b8/2) sin(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ] = [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]\n\nBecause cot(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2). So multiplying by sin(\u03b8/2) gives cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nWait, but let me check. Let me compute a = cos(\u03b8/2), b = sin(\u03b8/2). Then the norm is cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1. Yep, that works.\n\nSo the components are ( cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ). But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would be the components. But wait, the question says the eigenvector is for the direction n, which lies in the x-z plane, which makes sense.\n\nWait, but wait the operator is P, which is along n. Wait, but the spin operator along n would have eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2, right? Because the spin matrices have eigenvalues \u00b11/2 when multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nSo the eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along n. So our calculation leads to the eigenvector being [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] when normalized.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but that's for a vector in 2D. So the components would be the entries in the vector.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nOption C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what we found.\n\nBut wait, another thought: the eigenvector we found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. But another possibility is it being multiplied by some normalization factors or phases.\n\nWait, but in the options, some include factors of hbar, but the eigenvectors are dimensionless. Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are typically normalized and don't carry units like \u0127. So options A and D have hbar in their components, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector in Hilbert space.\n\nSo looking at the options, option C seems to fit. But let me check the other options.\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is more like spherical coordinates for a 3D vector, but our problem is in 2D Hilbert space, so that doesn't fit.\n\nOption D has sqrt(2/3) hbar multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sqrt(1/3) hbar multiplied by sin(theta/2). But again, the eigenvectors shouldn't have units like hbar.\n\nOption A is (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar), which also seems wrong because of the hbar units.\n\nSo the only option that makes sense is C. But wait, another thought: could the eigenvector have a different form?\n\nWait, the eigenvector we found is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. But in quantum mechanics, sometimes you see spin states written in terms of the Bloch sphere. For a spin-up state along direction n with angles (theta, phi), the state is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].\n\nIn our case, phi is zero because n is in the x-z plane, so phi =0. So the state becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWhich matches option C, which is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n",

So multiplying by sin(\u03b8/2) gives cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nWait, but let me check. Let me compute a = cos(\u03b8/2), b = sin(\u03b8/2). Then the norm is cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1. Yep, that works.\n\nSo the components are ( cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ). But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would be the components. But wait, the question says the eigenvector is for the direction n, which lies in the x-z plane, which makes sense.\n\nWait, but wait the operator is P, which is along n. Wait, but the spin operator along n would have eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2, right? Because the spin matrices have eigenvalues \u00b11/2 when multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nSo the eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along n. So our calculation leads to the eigenvector being [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] when normalized.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but that's for a vector in 2D. So the components would be the entries in the vector.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nOption C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what we found.\n\nBut wait, another thought: the eigenvector we found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. But another possibility is it being multiplied by some normalization factors or phases.\n\nWait, but in the options, some include factors of hbar, but the eigenvectors are dimensionless. Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are typically normalized and don't carry units like \u0127. So options A and D have hbar in their components, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector in Hilbert space.\n\nSo looking at the options, option C seems to fit. But let me check the other options.\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is more like spherical coordinates for a 3D vector, but our problem is in 2D Hilbert space, so that doesn't fit.\n\nOption D has sqrt(2/3) hbar multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sqrt(1/3) hbar multiplied by sin(theta/2). But again, the eigenvectors shouldn't have units like hbar.\n\nOption A is (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar), which also seems wrong because of the hbar units.\n\nSo the only option that makes sense is C. But wait, another thought: could the eigenvector have a different form?\n\nWait, the eigenvector we found is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. But in quantum mechanics, sometimes you see spin states written in terms of the Bloch sphere. For a spin-up state along direction n with angles (theta, phi), the state is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].\n\nIn our case, phi is zero because n is in the x-z plane, so phi =0. So the state becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWhich matches option C, which is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is expressed as a linear combination of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by $\\hbar/2$. Since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $y$-component $P_y$ does not contribute, and the operator simplifies to $P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x = \\sin\\theta$ and $n_z = \\cos\\theta$.\n\nThe matrix representation of $P$ becomes:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\\n\\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalue equation $P|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}|\\psi\\rangle$ leads to the normalized eigenvector being proportional to:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\\n\\sin(\\theta/2)\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThis result is consistent with the spin-up state along the direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, where the components of the eigenvector are derived using trigonometric identities and normalization conditions.\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n- **Option A**: Includes factors of $\\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.\n- **Option B**: Represents a 3D spherical coordinate system, which is not applicable here since the problem is in a 2D Hilbert space.\n- **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector components $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$, which is correct.\n- **Option D**: Includes incorrect normalization factors and $\\hbar$, which are inconsistent with the problem setup.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by \u0127/2. I need to find the normalized eigenvector elements from the given options.\n\nHmm, I remember that for spin-\u00bd particles like a muon, the spin operator components are represented by these Pauli matrices multiplied by \u0127/2. So the operator P along a direction n (which is in the x-z plane) can be expressed as a linear combination of these components.\n\nWait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the vector n would have components (nx, 0, nz), right? Because it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the unit vector n is (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx\u00b2 + nz\u00b2 = 1.\n\nThe operator P is given as a vector in spin space. The general form for the spin operator along a direction n is P = (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z), where \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z are the Pauli matrices. But in this problem, the components Px, Py, Pz are already provided as 2x2 matrices multiplied by \u0127/2. So Px is (\u0127/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the \u03c3_x matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. Similarly, Py is (\u0127/2)*[[0,-i],[i,0]], which is \u03c3_y multiplied by \u0127/2. Pz is (\u0127/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]], so \u03c3_z multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nSo the operator P along n is P = n_x Px + n_z Pz, because n_y is zero since n is in x-z plane. So substituting the matrices, P = (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z).\n\nWait, but the eigenvalue equation is P |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>. Because the eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. So I need to solve (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = I |\u03c8>, because when I factor out \u0127/2, the equation becomes (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>, so the matrix equation is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = I |\u03c8>.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me write it correctly. The operator P is (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z). So the eigenvalue equation is P |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>. So,\n\n(\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>,\n\nwhich simplifies to (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = |\u03c8>.\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation for the matrix M = n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z is M |\u03c8> = 1 * |\u03c8>.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are \u00b11, right? So for a spin-\u00bd particle, the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n are \u00b11. So the operator here, M, is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z), and when I apply it to the eigenvector, it gives 1 times the vector. So the eigenvalue is 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the spin operator. The eigenvectors of \u03c3\u00b7n are the spin-up and spin-down states along n. Since the eigenvalue here is +1 (times \u0127/2), the state is spin-up along n.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the eigenvector of the matrix M = n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z, corresponding to eigenvalue +1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express this in terms of spherical coordinates. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis. So n_x = sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, but wait, since n is in x-z, maybe \u03c6 is zero? Or wait, no, wait. Because the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle \u03c6 is zero or 180 degrees, but perhaps I can parameterize it with \u03b8 being the angle from the z-axis. So n would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), because in spherical coordinates, the direction is (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). But since \u03c6 is zero (since in x-z plane), n is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Wait, but in the problem, n is an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, so perhaps we can express it as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis.\n\nWait, but maybe I should parameterize the direction as (cos\u03b8, 0, sin\u03b8), which would make sense for some coordinate systems. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The direction in the x-z plane can be represented as (cos\u03b8, 0, sin\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the x-axis towards the z-axis. Alternatively, it can be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), depending on convention. I think I need to clarify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the Bloch sphere. The spin-up state along direction n is represented by a point on the Bloch sphere at polar angle \u03b8 and azimuthal angle \u03c6. Since n is in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is zero. So the state would have components based on \u03b8.\n\nWait, but the eigenvectors for spin-\u00bd along a direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) are given by the spin coherent states, which are |\u03b8, \u03c6> = e^{-i \u03c6 S_y} e^{i \u03b8 S_z} |\u2191>. But perhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, the eigenstate |+> along n is (cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i \u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)) )^T. Since \u03c6 is zero in this case because the direction is in the x-z plane, the state becomes (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)) )^T. But wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the general spin-up state along direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) is:\n\n|+> = [ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i \u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T.\n\nSince in our case, \u03c6 is zero (because n is in the x-z plane, so no component in y), the state simplifies to [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Another approach: the eigenvector for the spin operator S\u00b7n (where S is spin-\u00bd) with eigenvalue +\u0127/2 is given by the spinor [ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T, where \u03b8 is the polar angle (from z-axis), and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle. Since our n is in the x-z plane, \u03c6=0, so the spinor becomes [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but wait. The Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z. So when the direction is along n = (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), which is in the x-z plane, then the spin operator is S = (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z).\n\nSo the matrix M is n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z. Let's write M as:\n\nM = [ [n_z, n_x],\n      [n_x, -n_z] ]\n\nBecause \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So M = n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].\n\nThe eigenvalues of M can be found by solving det(M - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is:\n\n| M - \u03bb I | = | [n_z - \u03bb, n_x; n_x, -n_z - \u03bb ] | = (n_z - \u03bb)(-n_z - \u03bb) - n_x^2 = 0.\n\nExpanding this: (-n_z^2 - \u03bb n_z + \u03bb n_z + \u03bb^2) - n_x^2 = 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.\n\n(n_z - \u03bb)(-n_z - \u03bb) = -(n_z)^2 - \u03bb n_z + \u03bb n_z + \u03bb^2 = -n_z^2 + \u03bb^2.\n\nThen subtract n_x^2:\n\n- n_z^2 + \u03bb^2 - n_x^2 = 0 \u2192 \u03bb^2 = n_z^2 + n_x^2.\n\nBut since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1 \u2192 \u03bb^2 = 1 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.\n\nWe are interested in the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb = +1.\n\nSo the equation (M - I)|v> = 0.\n\nM - I = [[n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1 ]].\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n(n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0,\n\nn_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0.\n\nLet's take the first equation:\n\n(n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] v1.\n\nWait, but if n_x is zero, that's a problem. Let me think about the case when n_x is zero. If n_x is zero, then the direction is along z-axis, so \u03b8=0, and the eigenvector would be [1, 0], which is correct for spin-up along z.\n\nBut in our problem, n is in x-z plane, so n_x can be zero or non-zero.\n\nAssuming n_x \u2260 0, then v2 = ( (1 - n_z) / n_x ) v1.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [1, (1 - n_z)/n_x ].\n\nWait, but let me plug in the values. Let me think about the general case.\n\nBut perhaps there's another approach. Let me parameterize the direction. Let's say n is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), so n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nThen M = [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ].\n\nThe eigenvalue equation for \u03bb=1:\n\n[ (cos\u03b8 - 1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0,\n\n  sin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 - 1) v2 = 0 ]\n\nSo from the first equation:\n\nv2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 ] v1.\n\nAssuming sin\u03b8 \u2260 0.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [v1, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 v1 ].\n\nWe can factor v1 as a normalization factor. Let's write the vector as [1, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ].\n\nSimplify this expression: 1 - cos\u03b8 is 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 is 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] ] = tan(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the eigenvector becomes [1, tan(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nBut to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it. The norm squared is 1^2 + [tan(\u03b8/2)]^2 = 1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) )= sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2) \u2192 sqrt gives 1/cos(\u03b8/2). So the normalization factor is cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nWait, because [1 * cos(\u03b8/2), tan(\u03b8/2) * cos(\u03b8/2) ] = [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nYes, because tan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2), so when multiplied by cos(\u03b8/2), it's sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nBut wait, the question is about the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the components are cos(\u03b8/2) and sin(\u03b8/2), multiplied by \u0127? Wait, no, the options don't include \u0127 in the components. Wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut wait, another possibility is that the eigenvector has elements scaled by sqrt(2/3) \u0127 and sqrt(1/3) \u0127, as in option A. Or option D has sqrt(2/3) \u0127 cos(theta/2) and sqrt(1/3) \u0127 sin(theta/2). Hmm, but in the problem statement, the eigenvector is normalized, so the options should be normalized vectors.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?\" So the components should be in terms of angles and perhaps some factors.\n\nWait, but I'm getting [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] as the eigenvector. Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so that's a match. But let me think again.\n\nWait, but in my derivation, I assumed the direction is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Another way to parametrize is using the polar angle from the z-axis as theta. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle theta is measured from the z-axis, so the components are (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8).\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but what about the normalization? Because the eigenvector I found is already normalized. So the components are correct, but let me see the options again.\n\nOption C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches exactly what I derived. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me check the other options.\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is the spherical harmonic form but not the spinor form. So that's probably for orbital angular momentum, not spin.\n\nOption D includes sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which seems like some specific case, perhaps when theta is 60 degrees or something. But the problem states an arbitrary direction, so the answer should be in terms of theta, not specific values.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n",

Because it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the unit vector n is (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx\u00b2 + nz\u00b2 = 1.\n\nThe operator P is given as a vector in spin space.

Pz is (\u0127/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]], so \u03c3_z multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nSo the operator P along n is P = n_x Px + n_z Pz, because n_y is zero since n is in x-z plane. So substituting the matrices, P = (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z).\n\nWait, but the eigenvalue equation is P |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>. Because the eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. So I need to solve (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = I |\u03c8>, because when I factor out \u0127/2, the equation becomes (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>, so the matrix equation is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = I |\u03c8>.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me write it correctly. The operator P is (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z). So the eigenvalue equation is P |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>. So,\n\n(\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>,\n\nwhich simplifies to (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = |\u03c8>.\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation for the matrix M = n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z is M |\u03c8> = 1 * |\u03c8>.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are \u00b11, right? So for a spin-\u00bd particle, the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n are \u00b11. So the operator here, M, is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z), and when I apply it to the eigenvector, it gives 1 times the vector. So the eigenvalue is 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the spin operator. The eigenvectors of \u03c3\u00b7n are the spin-up and spin-down states along n. Since the eigenvalue here is +1 (times \u0127/2), the state is spin-up along n.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the eigenvector of the matrix M = n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z, corresponding to eigenvalue +1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express this in terms of spherical coordinates. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis. So n_x = sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, but wait, since n is in x-z, maybe \u03c6 is zero? Or wait, no, wait. Because the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle \u03c6 is zero or 180 degrees, but perhaps I can parameterize it with \u03b8 being the angle from the z-axis. So n would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), because in spherical coordinates, the direction is (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). But since \u03c6 is zero (since in x-z plane), n is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Wait, but in the problem, n is an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, so perhaps we can express it as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis.\n\nWait, but maybe I should parameterize the direction as (cos\u03b8, 0, sin\u03b8), which would make sense for some coordinate systems. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The direction in the x-z plane can be represented as (cos\u03b8, 0, sin\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the x-axis towards the z-axis. Alternatively, it can be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), depending on convention. I think I need to clarify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the Bloch sphere. The spin-up state along direction n is represented by a point on the Bloch sphere at polar angle \u03b8 and azimuthal angle \u03c6. Since n is in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is zero. So the state would have components based on \u03b8.\n\nWait, but the eigenvectors for spin-\u00bd along a direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) are given by the spin coherent states, which are |\u03b8, \u03c6> = e^{-i \u03c6 S_y} e^{i \u03b8 S_z} |\u2191>. But perhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, the eigenstate |+> along n is (cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i \u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)) )^T. Since \u03c6 is zero in this case because the direction is in the x-z plane, the state becomes (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)) )^T. But wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the general spin-up state along direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) is:\n\n|+> = [ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i \u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T.\n\nSince in our case, \u03c6 is zero (because n is in the x-z plane, so no component in y), the state simplifies to [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Another approach: the eigenvector for the spin operator S\u00b7n (where S is spin-\u00bd) with eigenvalue +\u0127/2 is given by the spinor [ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T, where \u03b8 is the polar angle (from z-axis), and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle. Since our n is in the x-z plane, \u03c6=0, so the spinor becomes [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but wait. The Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z. So when the direction is along n = (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), which is in the x-z plane, then the spin operator is S = (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z).\n\nSo the matrix M is n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z. Let's write M as:\n\nM = [ [n_z, n_x],\n      [n_x, -n_z] ]\n\nBecause \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So M = n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].\n\nThe eigenvalues of M can be found by solving det(M - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is:\n\n| M - \u03bb I | = | [n_z - \u03bb, n_x; n_x, -n_z - \u03bb ] | = (n_z - \u03bb)(-n_z - \u03bb) - n_x^2 = 0.\n\nExpanding this: (-n_z^2 - \u03bb n_z + \u03bb n_z + \u03bb^2) - n_x^2 = 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.\n\n(n_z - \u03bb)(-n_z - \u03bb) = -(n_z)^2 - \u03bb n_z + \u03bb n_z + \u03bb^2 = -n_z^2 + \u03bb^2.\n\nThen subtract n_x^2:\n\n- n_z^2 + \u03bb^2 - n_x^2 = 0 \u2192 \u03bb^2 = n_z^2 + n_x^2.\n\nBut since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1 \u2192 \u03bb^2 = 1 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.\n\nWe are interested in the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb = +1.\n\nSo the equation (M - I)|v> = 0.\n\nM - I = [[n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1 ]].\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n(n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0,\n\nn_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0.\n\nLet's take the first equation:\n\n(n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] v1.\n\nWait, but if n_x is zero, that's a problem. Let me think about the case when n_x is zero. If n_x is zero, then the direction is along z-axis, so \u03b8=0, and the eigenvector would be [1, 0], which is correct for spin-up along z.\n\nBut in our problem, n is in x-z plane, so n_x can be zero or non-zero.\n\nAssuming n_x \u2260 0, then v2 = ( (1 - n_z) / n_x ) v1.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [1, (1 - n_z)/n_x ].\n\nWait, but let me plug in the values. Let me think about the general case.\n\nBut perhaps there's another approach. Let me parameterize the direction. Let's say n is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), so n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nThen M = [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ].\n\nThe eigenvalue equation for \u03bb=1:\n\n[ (cos\u03b8 - 1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0,\n\n  sin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 - 1) v2 = 0 ]\n\nSo from the first equation:\n\nv2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 ] v1.\n\nAssuming sin\u03b8 \u2260 0.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [v1, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 v1 ].\n\nWe can factor v1 as a normalization factor. Let's write the vector as [1, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ].\n\nSimplify this expression: 1 - cos\u03b8 is 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 is 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] ] = tan(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the eigenvector becomes [1, tan(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nBut to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it. The norm squared is 1^2 + [tan(\u03b8/2)]^2 = 1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) )= sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2) \u2192 sqrt gives 1/cos(\u03b8/2). So the normalization factor is cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nWait, because [1 * cos(\u03b8/2), tan(\u03b8/2) * cos(\u03b8/2) ] = [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nYes, because tan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2), so when multiplied by cos(\u03b8/2), it's sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nBut wait, the question is about the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the components are cos(\u03b8/2) and sin(\u03b8/2), multiplied by \u0127? Wait, no, the options don't include \u0127 in the components. Wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut wait, another possibility is that the eigenvector has elements scaled by sqrt(2/3) \u0127 and sqrt(1/3) \u0127, as in option A. Or option D has sqrt(2/3) \u0127 cos(theta/2) and sqrt(1/3) \u0127 sin(theta/2). Hmm, but in the problem statement, the eigenvector is normalized, so the options should be normalized vectors.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?\" So the components should be in terms of angles and perhaps some factors.\n\nWait, but I'm getting [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] as the eigenvector. Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so that's a match. But let me think again.\n\nWait, but in my derivation, I assumed the direction is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Another way to parametrize is using the polar angle from the z-axis as theta. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle theta is measured from the z-axis, so the components are (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8).\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but what about the normalization? Because the eigenvector I found is already normalized. So the components are correct, but let me see the options again.\n\nOption C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches exactly what I derived. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me check the other options.\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is the spherical harmonic form but not the spinor form. So that's probably for orbital angular momentum, not spin.\n\nOption D includes sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which seems like some specific case, perhaps when theta is 60 degrees or something. But the problem states an arbitrary direction, so the answer should be in terms of theta, not specific values.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is expressed as a linear combination of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given in terms of $2 \\times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\\hbar/2$. Since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, its components are $(n_x, 0, n_z)$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. The eigenvalue equation for the operator $\\vec{P}$ simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(n_x \\sigma_x + n_z \\sigma_z) | \\psi \\rangle = | \\psi \\rangle,\n\\]\n\nwhere $\\sigma_x$, $\\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices, and $| \\psi \\rangle$ is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+1$.\n\nThe eigenvector of the spin operator $\\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ for a spin-\u00bd particle along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by:\n\n\\[\n| \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix},\n\\]\n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the polar angle measured from the z-axis. Since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ is zero, and the eigenvector simplifies to the above form. The components of the normalized eigenvector are $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- **Option A**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ does not match the derived eigenvector, as it introduces specific coefficients unrelated to $\\theta$.\n- **Option B**: $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin(\\theta))$ corresponds to spherical harmonics, not the spinor form of the eigenvector for spin-\u00bd particles.\n- **Option C**: $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.\n- **Option D**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin(\\theta/2))$ introduces unnecessary coefficients, which are not present in the normalized eigenvector.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it directly matches the derived normalized eigenvector.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, like a muon, the spin operators (like S_x, S_y, S_z) have specific matrix representations. But wait, in this problem, the operator is P, not S. But maybe P is analogous to the spin operator, like a Pauli matrix scaled by \u0127/2. Oh, right, because the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as \u0127/2 times some matrices. So, each P component is (\u0127/2) multiplied by a Pauli matrix.\n\nThe direction n is in the x-z plane, which means the direction vector has components (x, 0, z). So any vector in the x-z plane doesn't have a y-component. That's helpful because when you have an operator along an arbitrary direction, you can express it as a linear combination of the Pauli matrices.\n\nThe general form for the operator P along direction n (n_x, n_y, n_z) is P = (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z), where \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices. But since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P becomes (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z).\n\nWait, but the problem says the operator is P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector we're looking for is the eigenstate of this P operator with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nHmm, eigenvalues of P should be \u00b1(\u0127/2), right? Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11, so when multiplied by \u0127/2, they become \u00b1\u0127/2.\n\nSo, the eigenvalue equation is P |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>. Wait no, wait. The eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2, so:\n\nP |\u03c8> = (+\u0127/2) |\u03c8>.\n\nWait, but wait, the operator P is a vector operator. So when you have an operator along direction n, the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u0127/2. So the problem is to find the eigenvector for +\u0127/2.\n\nNow, the operator P is given as:\n\nP = n_x P_x + n_z P_z\n\nBecause n is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero.\n\nSo, substituting the given P_x, P_y, P_z:\n\nP_x = (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]\nP_z = (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]\nP_y isn't needed here because n is in x-z.\n\nSo, substituting, P becomes:\n\nP = (n_x) (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z) (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nWhich can be factored as (\u0127/2) [n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]\n\nLet me write that as (\u0127/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nn_x times [[0,1],[1,0]] is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]\n\nn_z times [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]\n\nAdding these two matrices:\n\n[[n_z, n_x],\n [n_x, -n_z]]\n\nSo yes, P is (\u0127/2) times that matrix.\n\nSo the matrix for P is (\u0127/2) multiplied by:\n\n[ [n_z, n_x],\n  [n_x, -n_z] ]\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nBecause the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2, the eigenvalue equation is:\n\nP |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>\n\nSo, substituting the matrix, we have:\n\n(\u0127/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>\n\nWe can multiply both sides by 2/\u0127 to simplify:\n\n[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |\u03c8> = |\u03c8>\n\nSo the matrix equation becomes:\n\n|n_z a + n_x b>        = |a|\n|n_x a - n_z b>        = |b>\n\nWhich gives us two equations:\n\n1. n_z a + n_x b = a\n2. n_x a - n_z b = b\n\nWait, let me write that:\n\nEquation 1: (n_z) a + (n_x) b = a \u2192 (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0.\n\nEquation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0? Wait, no:\n\nWait, equation 2 is n_x a - n_z b = b \u2192 n_x a = (n_z +1) b \u2192 a = [(n_z +1)/n_x ] b.\n\nWait, let me re-express both equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 \u2192 equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 2: n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0 \u2192 equation 2.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0\n2. n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0\n\nWe can solve this system for a and b.\n\nLet me write them as:\n\nEquation 1: (n_z -1) a = - n_x b \u2192 a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b\n\nEquation 2: n_x a = (n_z +1) b \u2192 a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b\n\nSo, setting the two expressions for a equal:\n\n[ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b\n\nAssuming b \u2260 0 (since otherwise the eigenvector would be trivial, which is not the case), we can divide both sides by b:\n\n- n_x / (n_z -1) = (n_z +1)/n_x\n\nMultiply both sides by (n_z -1) * n_x:\n\n- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) \u2192 -n_x\u00b2 = n_z\u00b2 -1 \u2192 n_z\u00b2 + n_x\u00b2 = 1\n\nWait, but n is a direction vector, so it's a unit vector, so n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 = 1. That holds, so our substitution is correct. So, the equations are consistent.\n\nSo, from equation 1:\n\na = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b\n\nBut let's think about the eigenvector. Let me express the ratio a/b.\n\na/b = -n_x/(n_z -1) \u2192 which can be written as [n_x/(1 - n_z)]\n\nSo, a = (n_x/(1 - n_z)) * b\n\nLet me choose b as a parameter, say, set b = 1 (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple). Then, a = n_x/(1 - n_z).\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to express the eigenvector in terms of angles. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, we can describe it using polar coordinates. Let me define \u03b8 as the angle from the z-axis. So, n_z = cos \u03b8, and n_x = sin \u03b8. Because in the x-z plane, the direction can be parametrized as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Wait, no, actually, wait: in the x-z plane, a unit vector would have components (sin\u03b8 cos \u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin \u03c6, cos\u03b8), but since the direction is in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to parametrize the direction as (x, 0, z), with x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo, let me define \u03b8 as the angle from the z-axis. So, n_z = cos\u03b8, n_x = sin\u03b8. So, substituting into a and b:\n\na = (n_x)/(1 - n_z) * b = [sin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8)] * b\n\nHmm, 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So,\n\na = [ 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) ) ] / [ 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ] * b\n= [ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ) ] * b\n= cot(\u03b8/2) * b\n\nSo, a = cot(\u03b8/2) b.\n\nSo, the eigenvector components are (a, b) = (cot(\u03b8/2) b, b). Let's factor out b, so the vector is proportional to (cot(\u03b8/2), 1).\n\nBut wait, cot(\u03b8/2) can be written as cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2). So, the vector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ] multiplied by something. Wait, let me see:\n\ncot(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2). So, the vector is [ cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2), 1 ].\n\nTo make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it. Let's compute the magnitude squared:\n\n( [ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ] )^2 + (1)^2 = [ cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ] / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) = 1/sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo, the magnitude is 1/sin(\u03b8/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ] multiplied by sin(\u03b8/2), because:\n\n[ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ] * sin(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)\nand\n1 * sin(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nWait, no, wait: if the original vector is (a, b) = (cot(\u03b8/2), 1), the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1 + cot\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) ). Alternatively, perhaps I should find the normalization factor.\n\nWait, the vector is (cot(\u03b8/2), 1), so its squared magnitude is cot\u00b2(\u03b8/2) +1 = csc\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1/sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2). So, the magnitude is 1/sin(\u03b8/2). Therefore, the normalized vector is [ sin(\u03b8/2) * cot(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) * 1 ].\n\nWhich simplifies to [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches. But wait, let me check the other options.\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which seems like spherical coordinates but not in the way we're thinking. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, which I don't see here. Option A has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar, but I don't think hbar is part of the eigenvector; eigenvectors are dimensionless.\n\nWait, but wait, the eigenvectors are generally just vectors in Hilbert space, so their components are dimensionless. So any option with hbar in them is probably incorrect.\n\nLooking again, the problem says \"the elements of the normalized eigenvector\". So option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I derived. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The direction n is in the x-z plane. So, the angle theta is measured from the z-axis, so n is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Then, when I express the operator P along n, the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the operator is P, which might be the spin operator. So the spin-up state along direction n has components (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nYes, that's right. The eigenvectors for spin-1/2 particles along an arbitrary direction are given by the spin coherent states, which have components like (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)). But in this case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero or pi, so e^{i phi} is either 1 or -1. But the options don't include that, so perhaps the problem assumes phi=0 for simplicity, making it (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nLooking back, option C is exactly that. So the answer should be option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, like a muon, the spin operators (like S_x, S_y, S_z) have specific matrix representations. But wait, in this problem, the operator is P, not S. But maybe P is analogous to the spin operator, like a Pauli matrix scaled by \u0127/2. Oh, right, because the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as \u0127/2 times some matrices. So, each P component is (\u0127/2) multiplied by a Pauli matrix.\n\nThe direction n is in the x-z plane, which means the direction vector has components (x, 0, z). So any vector in the x-z plane doesn't have a y-component. That's helpful because when you have an operator along an arbitrary direction, you can express it as a linear combination of the Pauli matrices.\n\nThe general form for the operator P along direction n (n_x, n_y, n_z) is P = (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z), where \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices. But since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P becomes (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z).\n\nWait, but the problem says the operator is P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector we're looking for is the eigenstate of this P operator with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nHmm, eigenvalues of P should be \u00b1(\u0127/2), right? Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11, so when multiplied by \u0127/2, they become \u00b1\u0127/2.\n\nSo, the eigenvalue equation is P |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>. Wait no, wait. The eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2, so:\n\nP |\u03c8> = (+\u0127/2) |\u03c8>.\n\nWait, but wait, the operator P is a vector operator. So when you have an operator along direction n, the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u0127/2. So the problem is to find the eigenvector for +\u0127/2.\n\nNow, the operator P is given as:\n\nP = n_x P_x + n_z P_z\n\nBecause n is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero.\n\nSo, substituting the given P_x, P_y, P_z:\n\nP_x = (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]\nP_z = (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]\nP_y isn't needed here because n is in x-z.\n\nSo, substituting, P becomes:\n\nP = (n_x) (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z) (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nWhich can be factored as (\u0127/2) [n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]\n\nLet me write that as (\u0127/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nn_x times [[0,1],[1,0]] is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]\n\nn_z times [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]\n\nAdding these two matrices:\n\n[[n_z, n_x],\n [n_x, -n_z]]\n\nSo yes, P is (\u0127/2) times that matrix.\n\nSo the matrix for P is (\u0127/2) multiplied by:\n\n[ [n_z, n_x],\n  [n_x, -n_z] ]\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nBecause the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2, the eigenvalue equation is:\n\nP |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>\n\nSo, substituting the matrix, we have:\n\n(\u0127/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>\n\nWe can multiply both sides by 2/\u0127 to simplify:\n\n[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |\u03c8> = |\u03c8>\n\nSo the matrix equation becomes:\n\n|n_z a + n_x b>        = |a|\n|n_x a - n_z b>        = |b>\n\nWhich gives us two equations:\n\n1. n_z a + n_x b = a\n2. n_x a - n_z b = b\n\nWait, let me write that:\n\nEquation 1: (n_z) a + (n_x) b = a \u2192 (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0.\n\nEquation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0? Wait, no:\n\nWait, equation 2 is n_x a - n_z b = b \u2192 n_x a = (n_z +1) b \u2192 a = [(n_z +1)/n_x ] b.\n\nWait, let me re-express both equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 \u2192 equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 2: n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0 \u2192 equation 2.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0\n2. n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0\n\nWe can solve this system for a and b.\n\nLet me write them as:\n\nEquation 1: (n_z -1) a = - n_x b \u2192 a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b\n\nEquation 2: n_x a = (n_z +1) b \u2192 a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b\n\nSo, setting the two expressions for a equal:\n\n[ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b\n\nAssuming b \u2260 0 (since otherwise the eigenvector would be trivial, which is not the case), we can divide both sides by b:\n\n- n_x / (n_z -1) = (n_z +1)/n_x\n\nMultiply both sides by (n_z -1) * n_x:\n\n- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) \u2192 -n_x\u00b2 = n_z\u00b2 -1 \u2192 n_z\u00b2 + n_x\u00b2 = 1\n\nWait, but n is a direction vector, so it's a unit vector, so n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 = 1. That holds, so our substitution is correct. So, the equations are consistent.\n\nSo, from equation 1:\n\na = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b\n\nBut let's think about the eigenvector. Let me express the ratio a/b.\n\na/b = -n_x/(n_z -1) \u2192 which can be written as [n_x/(1 - n_z)]\n\nSo, a = (n_x/(1 - n_z)) * b\n\nLet me choose b as a parameter, say, set b = 1 (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple). Then, a = n_x/(1 - n_z).\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to express the eigenvector in terms of angles. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, we can describe it using polar coordinates. Let me define \u03b8 as the angle from the z-axis. So, n_z = cos \u03b8, and n_x = sin \u03b8. Because in the x-z plane, the direction can be parametrized as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Wait, no, actually, wait: in the x-z plane, a unit vector would have components (sin\u03b8 cos \u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin \u03c6, cos\u03b8), but since the direction is in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to parametrize the direction as (x, 0, z), with x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo, let me define \u03b8 as the angle from the z-axis. So, n_z = cos\u03b8, n_x = sin\u03b8. So, substituting into a and b:\n\na = (n_x)/(1 - n_z) * b = [sin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8)] * b\n\nHmm, 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So,\n\na = [ 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) ) ] / [ 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ] * b\n= [ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ) ] * b\n= cot(\u03b8/2) * b\n\nSo, a = cot(\u03b8/2) b.\n\nSo, the eigenvector components are (a, b) = (cot(\u03b8/2) b, b). Let's factor out b, so the vector is proportional to (cot(\u03b8/2), 1).\n\nBut wait, cot(\u03b8/2) can be written as cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2). So, the vector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ] multiplied by something. Wait, let me see:\n\ncot(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2). So, the vector is [ cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2), 1 ].\n\nTo make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it. Let's compute the magnitude squared:\n\n( [ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ] )^2 + (1)^2 = [ cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ] / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) = 1/sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo, the magnitude is 1/sin(\u03b8/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ] multiplied by sin(\u03b8/2), because:\n\n[ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ] * sin(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)\nand\n1 * sin(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nWait, no, wait: if the original vector is (a, b) = (cot(\u03b8/2), 1), the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1 + cot\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) ). Alternatively, perhaps I should find the normalization factor.\n\nWait, the vector is (cot(\u03b8/2), 1), so its squared magnitude is cot\u00b2(\u03b8/2) +1 = csc\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1/sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2). So, the magnitude is 1/sin(\u03b8/2). Therefore, the normalized vector is [ sin(\u03b8/2) * cot(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) * 1 ].\n\nWhich simplifies to [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches. But wait, let me check the other options.\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which seems like spherical coordinates but not in the way we're thinking. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, which I don't see here. Option A has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar, but I don't think hbar is part of the eigenvector; eigenvectors are dimensionless.\n\nWait, but wait, the eigenvectors are generally just vectors in Hilbert space, so their components are dimensionless. So any option with hbar in them is probably incorrect.\n\nLooking again, the problem says \"the elements of the normalized eigenvector\". So option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I derived. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The direction n is in the x-z plane. So, the angle theta is measured from the z-axis, so n is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Then, when I express the operator P along n, the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the operator is P, which might be the spin operator. So the spin-up state along direction n has components (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nYes, that's right. The eigenvectors for spin-1/2 particles along an arbitrary direction are given by the spin coherent states, which have components like (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)). But in this case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero or pi, so e^{i phi} is either 1 or -1. But the options don't include that, so perhaps the problem assumes phi=0 for simplicity, making it (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nLooking back, option C is exactly that. So the answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $P_y$ component does not contribute, and the operator simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( n_x \\sigma_x + n_z \\sigma_z \\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere $n_x$ and $n_z$ are the components of the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. Substituting the matrix representations of $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$, the operator $P$ becomes:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \n\\begin{bmatrix}\nn_z & n_x \\\\\nn_x & -n_z\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is:\n\n\\[\nP | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} | \\psi \\rangle,\n\\]\n\nwhere $| \\psi \\rangle$ is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators are represented by matrices, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states when the operator is measured. So, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nThe problem states that the direction n is in the x-z plane. That probably means the direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane, so the angle \u03b8 would be measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis. I think that when dealing with spin operators, especially for particles like a muon (which is similar to an electron in this context), the spin operator along a direction n can be expressed as a combination of the Pauli matrices.\n\nWait, right! The general form for the spin operator along an arbitrary direction n is S = (\u0127/2) (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z). But since the direction n is in the x-z plane, that means the y-component of n is zero. So n is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) perhaps? Or maybe it's (something else). Wait, actually, in spherical coordinates, a direction in the x-z plane would have \u03b8 measured from the z-axis, and \u03c6 would be zero or 180 degrees since it's in the x-z plane. So n could be represented as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), but I'm not entirely sure about the exact parametrization.\n\nBut wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components. So the operator P is the vector operator whose components are Px, Py, Pz. So the operator P along direction n would be P \u00b7 n\u0302 = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P\u00b7n\u0302 = n_x Px + n_z Pz.\n\nHmm. So to find the eigenvector of P along n with eigenvalue +\u0127/2, we need to find the eigenvector of the matrix (n_x Px + n_z Pz) corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nWait, but the eigenvalues of the spin operator along any direction are \u00b1\u0127/2. So when we have P\u00b7n\u0302 |\u03c8> = (\u00b1\u0127/2) |\u03c8>, that's the eigenvalue equation.\n\nSo let me write down the matrices for Px, Py, and Pz.\n\nGiven:\nPx = (\u0127/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nPy = (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\nPz = (\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSo, n is in x-z plane, so n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 = 1. So n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8, perhaps? Or maybe n_z is cos\u03b8, and n_x is sin\u03b8. Let me think. The standard parametrization is that for a point on the unit sphere, the polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis. So in spherical coordinates, x = sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, y = sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, z = cos\u03b8. But since our direction is in x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0. So n_x = sin\u03b8 * cos(0) = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. So n is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). So n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. Thus, the operator P\u00b7n\u0302 becomes (sin\u03b8 * Px + cos\u03b8 * Pz) multiplied by \u0127/2? Wait, no, because each component (Px, Py, Pz) is already multiplied by \u0127/2. So when we take n_x Px, it's (sin\u03b8)(\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], and similarly for n_z Pz.\n\nSo the total operator is (sin\u03b8 * Px + cos\u03b8 * Pz) = sin\u03b8 * (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nLet me compute this matrix.\n\nSo the matrix would be (\u0127/2) multiplied by [ [ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ], [ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ] ].\n\nWait, let's see. Let me compute each element:\n\nTop-left element: cos\u03b8 (from Pz) + sin\u03b8 * 0 (since Px has zero in top-left when multiplied by sin\u03b8). So cos\u03b8.\n\nTop-right element: sin\u03b8 * 1 (from Px) + cos\u03b8 * 0 (since Pz has zero there). So sin\u03b8.\n\nBottom-left: sin\u03b8 * 1 + cos\u03b8 * 0. So sin\u03b8.\n\nBottom-right: sin\u03b8 * 0 + cos\u03b8 * (-1). So -cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the matrix is (\u0127/2) * [[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ], [ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ] ]\n\nSo, the eigenvalue equation is:\n\n[ [ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ], [ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ] ] * [ a; b ] = (eigenvalue / (\u0127/2)) [ a; b ]\n\nWait, actually, the operator is (\u0127/2) times that matrix, so the eigenvalue equation is:\n\n( (\u0127/2) * [[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ], [ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ]] ) * |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) * (+1) |\u03c8>\n\nWait, because the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. So dividing both sides by \u0127/2, we get:\n\n[[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ], [ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ]] |\u03c8> = [1; 0] |\u03c8>\n\nSo the matrix equation becomes:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 * a + sin\u03b8 * b ] = \u03bb a\n\n[ sin\u03b8 * a - cos\u03b8 * b ] = \u03bb b\n\nBut the eigenvalue \u03bb here is 1, because the right-hand side after dividing is (1) * a and (1) * b.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The eigenvalue equation is (matrix) * |\u03c8> = \u03bb |\u03c8>, where the matrix is [[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ], [ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ] ].\n\nSo the equations are:\n\ncos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b = \u03bb a\n\nsin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b = \u03bb b\n\nWe can write this as a system:\n\n( cos\u03b8 - \u03bb ) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n\nsin\u03b8 a + ( -cos\u03b8 - \u03bb ) b = 0\n\nThis is a homogeneous system, which will have non-trivial solutions only if the determinant is zero.\n\nThe determinant of the coefficient matrix is:\n\n( cos\u03b8 - \u03bb ) ( -cos\u03b8 - \u03bb ) - ( sin\u03b8 ) ( sin\u03b8 )\n\n= ( -cos\u00b2\u03b8 - \u03bb cos\u03b8 + \u03bb cos\u03b8 + \u03bb\u00b2 ) - sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\n= ( -cos\u00b2\u03b8 + \u03bb\u00b2 ) - sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\n= \u03bb\u00b2 - ( cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) \n\n= \u03bb\u00b2 -1 \n\nFor non-trivial solutions, the determinant must be zero. So \u03bb\u00b2 -1 = 0 \u2192 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. Since we are looking for the eigenvalue +\u0127/2, the corresponding \u03bb here is 1. So our eigenvalue is \u03bb=1.\n\nSo substituting \u03bb=1 into the equations:\n\n( cos\u03b8 - 1 ) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n\nsin\u03b8 a + ( -cos\u03b8 - 1 ) b = 0\n\nWe can take the first equation: ( cos\u03b8 -1 ) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0 \u2192 (1 - cos\u03b8) a = sin\u03b8 b \u2192 a = [ sin\u03b8 / (1 - cos\u03b8) ] b.\n\nLet me simplify sin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8). Using the identity 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So:\n\nsin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8) = [ 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) ] / [ 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ] = cot(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo a = cot(\u03b8/2) b.\n\nLet me write b as a parameter, say b = t. Then a = cot(\u03b8/2) t.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(\u03b8/2), 1 ]^T.\n\nWait, but let me check using another equation to see if this holds. Let's substitute into the second equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 a + ( -cos\u03b8 -1 ) b = 0.\n\nSubstitute a = cot(\u03b8/2) b:\n\nsin\u03b8 * cot(\u03b8/2) b + ( -cos\u03b8 -1 ) b = 0.\n\nFactor out b:\n\n[ sin\u03b8 cot(\u03b8/2) - cos\u03b8 -1 ] = 0.\n\nCompute sin\u03b8 cot(\u03b8/2):\n\ncot(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo sin\u03b8 * cot(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ) ] = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) - cos\u03b8 -1 = 0?\n\nWait, let's compute this.\n\n2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) is equal to 1 + cos\u03b8, because of the double-angle formula: cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) -1 \u2192 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) = 1 + cos\u03b8.\n\nSo 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) = 1 + cos\u03b8.\n\nSo substituting into the expression:\n\n(1 + cos\u03b8) - cos\u03b8 -1 = 0 \u2192 0. So yes, it's correct. So the second equation is satisfied.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2) t, t ].\n\nBut we need to normalize this vector. Let me compute the normalization condition.\n\nThe norm is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(theta/2) t|^2 + |t|^2 = t\u00b2 [ cot\u00b2(theta/2) + 1 ] = t\u00b2 csc\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nBecause cot\u00b2x +1 = csc\u00b2x.\n\nSo to normalize, t\u00b2 csc\u00b2(theta/2) = 1 \u2192 t = sin(theta/2).\n\nSo t = sin(theta/2), since we can take the positive root.\n\nThus, a = cot(theta/2) sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).\n\nBecause cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so a = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).\n\nAnd b = t = sin(theta/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, but let me check the normalization: |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cos\u00b2(theta/2) + sin\u00b2(theta/2) =1. Yep, correct.\n\nSo the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but wait, the option says (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)). But in our case, since the eigenvector is real, phi is zero. So option C is correct, but wait, the other options have hbar in them. Wait, the options include hbar in the elements. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: it asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvector is a vector in a 2-component spinor, and the components are these trigonometric functions, but without any hbar factors because hbar is in the operator, not the eigenvector.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found.\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which doesn't match. Option D has hbar factors and theta/2.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says the operator P has components with \u0127/2, but the eigenvector is a vector in Hilbert space, so the components are just the normalized spinor components. So the eigenvector's elements shouldn't have hbar in them. So the correct option should have elements without hbar.\n\nLooking again, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, the question says the eigenvector is for the operator P along n. The operator is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) multiplied by \u0127/2? No, wait, the components P_x, P_y, P_z are already multiplied by \u0127/2. So the operator along n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). So the matrix is (n_x * \u0127/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * \u0127/2 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]).\n\nSo the eigenvalue is \u00b1 \u0127/2. So in the equation, the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2.\n\nWait, but when we set up the equation, we had (P\u00b7n) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>, because the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2.\n\nWait, when I set up the matrix equation earlier, I think I messed up the division. Let me re-express.\n\nThe operator is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) = n_x (\u0127/2) \u03c3_x + n_z (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z.\n\nSo, the operator is (\u0127/2) (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z).\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = (1) |\u03c8> because:\n\n(\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8> \u2192 (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = |\u03c8>.\n\nSo the matrix becomes:\n\n[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]\n\nWhich, with n_z = cos\u03b8 and n_x = sin\u03b8, becomes:\n\n[[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ], [ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ]]\n\nSo as before.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalue is 1, leading to the eigenvector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nOption D includes hbar and theta/2 in a different way.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators are represented by matrices, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states when the operator is measured. So, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nThe problem states that the direction n is in the x-z plane.

The eigenvalue equation is (matrix) * |\u03c8> = \u03bb |\u03c8>, where the matrix is [[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ], [ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ] ].\n\nSo the equations are:\n\ncos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b = \u03bb a\n\nsin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b = \u03bb b\n\nWe can write this as a system:\n\n( cos\u03b8 - \u03bb ) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n\nsin\u03b8 a + ( -cos\u03b8 - \u03bb ) b = 0\n\nThis is a homogeneous system, which will have non-trivial solutions only if the determinant is zero.\n\nThe determinant of the coefficient matrix is:\n\n( cos\u03b8 - \u03bb ) ( -cos\u03b8 - \u03bb ) - ( sin\u03b8 ) ( sin\u03b8 )\n\n= ( -cos\u00b2\u03b8 - \u03bb cos\u03b8 + \u03bb cos\u03b8 + \u03bb\u00b2 ) - sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\n= ( -cos\u00b2\u03b8 + \u03bb\u00b2 ) - sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\n= \u03bb\u00b2 - ( cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) \n\n= \u03bb\u00b2 -1 \n\nFor non-trivial solutions, the determinant must be zero. So \u03bb\u00b2 -1 = 0 \u2192 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. Since we are looking for the eigenvalue +\u0127/2, the corresponding \u03bb here is 1. So our eigenvalue is \u03bb=1.\n\nSo substituting \u03bb=1 into the equations:\n\n( cos\u03b8 - 1 ) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n\nsin\u03b8 a + ( -cos\u03b8 - 1 ) b = 0\n\nWe can take the first equation: ( cos\u03b8 -1 ) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0 \u2192 (1 - cos\u03b8) a = sin\u03b8 b \u2192 a = [ sin\u03b8 / (1 - cos\u03b8) ] b.\n\nLet me simplify sin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8). Using the identity 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So:\n\nsin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8) = [ 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) ] / [ 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ] = cot(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo a = cot(\u03b8/2) b.\n\nLet me write b as a parameter, say b = t. Then a = cot(\u03b8/2) t.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(\u03b8/2), 1 ]^T.\n\nWait, but let me check using another equation to see if this holds. Let's substitute into the second equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 a + ( -cos\u03b8 -1 ) b = 0.\n\nSubstitute a = cot(\u03b8/2) b:\n\nsin\u03b8 * cot(\u03b8/2) b + ( -cos\u03b8 -1 ) b = 0.\n\nFactor out b:\n\n[ sin\u03b8 cot(\u03b8/2) - cos\u03b8 -1 ] = 0.\n\nCompute sin\u03b8 cot(\u03b8/2):\n\ncot(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo sin\u03b8 * cot(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ) ] = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) - cos\u03b8 -1 = 0?\n\nWait, let's compute this.\n\n2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) is equal to 1 + cos\u03b8, because of the double-angle formula: cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) -1 \u2192 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) = 1 + cos\u03b8.\n\nSo 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) = 1 + cos\u03b8.\n\nSo substituting into the expression:\n\n(1 + cos\u03b8) - cos\u03b8 -1 = 0 \u2192 0. So yes, it's correct. So the second equation is satisfied.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2) t, t ].\n\nBut we need to normalize this vector. Let me compute the normalization condition.\n\nThe norm is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(theta/2) t|^2 + |t|^2 = t\u00b2 [ cot\u00b2(theta/2) + 1 ] = t\u00b2 csc\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nBecause cot\u00b2x +1 = csc\u00b2x.\n\nSo to normalize, t\u00b2 csc\u00b2(theta/2) = 1 \u2192 t = sin(theta/2).\n\nSo t = sin(theta/2), since we can take the positive root.\n\nThus, a = cot(theta/2) sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).\n\nBecause cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so a = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).\n\nAnd b = t = sin(theta/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, but let me check the normalization: |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cos\u00b2(theta/2) + sin\u00b2(theta/2) =1. Yep, correct.\n\nSo the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but wait, the option says (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)). But in our case, since the eigenvector is real, phi is zero. So option C is correct, but wait, the other options have hbar in them. Wait, the options include hbar in the elements. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: it asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvector is a vector in a 2-component spinor, and the components are these trigonometric functions, but without any hbar factors because hbar is in the operator, not the eigenvector.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found.\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which doesn't match. Option D has hbar factors and theta/2.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says the operator P has components with \u0127/2, but the eigenvector is a vector in Hilbert space, so the components are just the normalized spinor components. So the eigenvector's elements shouldn't have hbar in them. So the correct option should have elements without hbar.\n\nLooking again, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, the question says the eigenvector is for the operator P along n. The operator is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) multiplied by \u0127/2? No, wait, the components P_x, P_y, P_z are already multiplied by \u0127/2. So the operator along n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). So the matrix is (n_x * \u0127/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * \u0127/2 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]).\n\nSo the eigenvalue is \u00b1 \u0127/2. So in the equation, the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2.\n\nWait, but when we set up the equation, we had (P\u00b7n) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>, because the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2.\n\nWait, when I set up the matrix equation earlier, I think I messed up the division. Let me re-express.\n\nThe operator is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) = n_x (\u0127/2) \u03c3_x + n_z (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z.\n\nSo, the operator is (\u0127/2) (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z).\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = (1) |\u03c8> because:\n\n(\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8> \u2192 (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = |\u03c8>.\n\nSo the matrix becomes:\n\n[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]\n\nWhich, with n_z = cos\u03b8 and n_x = sin\u03b8, becomes:\n\n[[ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ], [ sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 ]]\n\nSo as before.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalue is 1, leading to the eigenvector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nOption D includes hbar and theta/2 in a different way.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are 2x2 matrices multiplied by $\\hbar/2$. The direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle measured from the z-axis.\n\nThe operator $\\vec{P}$ along $\\vec{n}$ is expressed as $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\hat{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$. Substituting $n_x = \\sin\\theta$ and $n_z = \\cos\\theta$, the matrix representation of $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\hat{n}$ becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\hat{n} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\\n\\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\\n\\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na \\\\\nb\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\lambda\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na \\\\\nb\n\\end{bmatrix},\n\\]\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ corresponds to the eigenvalue. For the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$, dividing through by $\\hbar/2$, we find $\\lambda = 1$. Solving the system of equations derived from the eigenvalue condition, the eigenvector components are proportional to $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. Normalizing this vector ensures that the components satisfy $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$, which they do since $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n\nThe normalized eigenvector is therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\\n\\sin(\\theta/2)\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- **Option A** includes $\\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because the eigenvector components do not include $\\hbar$.\n- **Option B** introduces $e^{i\\phi}$, which is unnecessary since the eigenvector is real in this case.\n- **Option C** matches the derived normalized eigenvector $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n- **Option D** incorrectly includes $\\hbar$ and modifies the components, which does not align with the solution.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. Hmm, wait, the operator is P, and it's along some direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, operators like spin are often represented as vectors, so maybe this is about spin angular momentum?\n\nWait, the problem gives the components of the operator P. Specifically, Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is (\u0127/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So Px is (\u0127/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], Py is (\u0127/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Pz is (\u0127/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nOh, I remember that these matrices look familiar. For spin-\u00bd particles, the Pauli matrices multiplied by \u0127/2 give the components of the spin operator. So I think P is the spin operator here. So the operator in question is the spin operator along some direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, meaning that the angle \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2 or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the eigenvector we're looking for is for the operator P along n. So the operator is P\u00b7n, which would be P_x * nx + P_y * ny + P_z * nz. But since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component ny is zero. So the operator simplifies to P_x * nx + P_z * nz.\n\nBut wait, the eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. So we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2 of the operator P\u00b7n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this operator as proportional to the Pauli matrices. So let me think: the spin operator along direction n is given by (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z) multiplied by \u0127/2. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0.\n\nSo the operator becomes (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) * (\u0127/2).\n\nHmm, \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the operator P\u00b7n is (n_x * \u03c3_x + n_z * \u03c3_z) * (\u0127/2).\n\nSo the matrix for P\u00b7n would be:\n\n(\u0127/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]\n\nBecause when you multiply the matrices: \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], multiplied by n_x gives [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]. \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]] multiplied by n_z gives [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]. Adding them together gives [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].\n\nSo the matrix for P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is:\n\n(P\u00b7n) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>\n\nWhich, substituting the matrix, becomes:\n\n(\u0127/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = (\u0127/2) [a; b]\n\nWait, let me write this without the (\u0127/2) factor for simplicity. Let me divide both sides by (\u0127/2):\n\n[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = [a; b]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn_z a + n_x b = a\nn_x a - n_z b = b\n\nLet me rearrange these equations.\n\nFrom the first equation:\nn_z a + n_x b = a \u2192 (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0\n\nFrom the second equation:\nn_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0 \u2192 n_x a = (n_z +1) b \u2192 a = [(n_z +1)/n_x] b, assuming n_x is not zero.\n\nWait, but let's think about this. The direction n is in the x-z plane, so n_x and n_z are such that n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 = 1 (assuming it's a unit vector). So perhaps we can parameterize n in terms of an angle \u03b8. Let me say that n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis. So \u03b8=0 is along z, \u03b8=\u03c0/2 is along x.\n\nSo substituting n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nThen the first equation becomes:\n\n(cos\u03b8 - 1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n\nThe second equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 + 1) b = 0\n\nSo, from the second equation: sin\u03b8 a = (cos\u03b8 +1) b \u2192 a = [(cos\u03b8 +1)/ sin\u03b8] b\n\nBut wait, let's substitute a from the second equation into the first.\n\nFrom second equation: a = [(cos\u03b8 + 1)/ sin\u03b8] b.\n\nSubstitute into first equation:\n\n(cos\u03b8 - 1) * [ (cos\u03b8 +1)/ sin\u03b8 * b ] + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n\nLet me compute the first term:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1)(cos\u03b8 +1) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 -1 = -sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n[ (-sin\u00b2\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 ] b + sin\u03b8 b = 0 \u2192 [ - sin\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 ] b = 0 \u2192 0 =0.\n\nSo that's consistent. So the equations are dependent, so we can just use the second equation to express a in terms of b.\n\nSo a = [ (cos\u03b8 +1)/ sin\u03b8 ] b.\n\nBut we can write this as a = [ (1 + cos\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 ] b.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can write this in terms of tan(\u03b8/2) because 1 + cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So,\n\n(1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] ) = [ cos(\u03b8/2) ] / [ sin(\u03b8/2) ] = cot(\u03b8/2) = tan(\u03c0/2 - \u03b8/2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the ratio a/b as (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8.\n\nBut perhaps another approach would be better. Let me think about the eigenvectors of spin operators. For a spin-\u00bd particle, the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along the direction n. The spin-up state for direction n has eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nWait, the eigenvector for spin-up along direction n can be written in terms of the eigenstates of S_z. Let me recall that for a spin-\u00bd particle, the state |+n> can be written as:\n\n|+n> = cos(\u03b8/2) |\u2191> + e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) |\u2193>\n\nBut wait, in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so \u03c6=0 because it's in the x-z plane. So the state becomes:\n\n|+n> = cos(\u03b8/2) |\u2191> + sin(\u03b8/2) |\u2193>\n\nBut wait, |\u2191> is [1; 0], |\u2193> is [0;1]. So the vector would be [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nWait, but that's only if the state is in the x-z plane, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the state is given as [ sqrt( (1 + cos\u03b8)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - cos\u03b8)/2 ) ].\n\nWait, I think I should compute the eigenvector for the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. Let me write this matrix as:\n\nM = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]\n\nThe eigenvalues of M would be the solutions to det(M - \u03bb I) =0.\n\nSo det( [[n_z - \u03bb, n_x], [n_x, -n_z - \u03bb] ]) = (n_z - \u03bb)(-n_z - \u03bb) - n_x^2 = 0.\n\nExpanding:\n\n(-n_z^2 - \u03bb n_z + \u03bb n_z + \u03bb^2) - n_x^2 = 0 \u2192 (-n_z^2 + \u03bb^2) - n_x^2 = 0 \u2192 \u03bb^2 = n_z^2 + n_x^2.\n\nBut since n is a unit vector, n_z^2 + n_x^2 =1. So \u03bb^2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=\u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues for P\u00b7n would be (\u0127/2)*1 and (\u0127/2)*(-1), i.e., \u00b1\u0127/2.\n\nSo for the eigenvalue +1 (after dividing by (\u0127/2)), the eigenvector satisfies (M - I)|v> =0.\n\nSo M - I is [[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0\n\nn_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0\n\nWait, let me write the first equation:\n\n(n_z - 1) a + n_x b =0 \u2192 (n_z -1) a = -n_x b \u2192 a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b.\n\nBut from the second equation:\n\nn_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0 \u2192 n_x a = (n_z +1) b \u2192 a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.\n\nSo combining the two expressions for a:\n\n[ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.\n\nAssuming b \u22600,\n\n- n_x^2 / (n_z -1) = (n_z +1)\n\nMultiply both sides by (n_z -1):\n\n- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) \u2192 -n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1.\n\nBut since n_x^2 +n_z^2=1, n_z^2 = 1 -n_x^2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n- n_x^2 = (1 -n_x^2) -1 \u2192 -n_x^2 = -n_x^2 \u2192 0=0.\n\nSo the equations are consistent, and we can choose a ratio. Let's take a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [ (n_z +1), n_x ]^T. Because a = [(n_z +1)/n_x] b \u2192 [a; b] = [ (n_z +1)/n_x * b; b ] = b [ (n_z +1)/n_x ; 1 ].\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [ (n_z +1), n_x ]^T multiplied by some scalar.\n\nWait, but let's compute this in terms of \u03b8.\n\nSince n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the vector becomes [ (cos\u03b8 +1), sin\u03b8 ]^T.\n\nTo normalize this, we compute the norm squared: (cos\u03b8 +1)^2 + sin^2\u03b8.\n\nExpanding (cos\u03b8 +1)^2 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 cos\u03b8 +1.\n\nAdding sin\u00b2\u03b8: cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 cos\u03b8 +1 = 1 + 2 cos\u03b8 +1 = 2(1 + cos\u03b8).\n\nSo the norm is sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8)).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ (cos\u03b8 +1), sin\u03b8 ]^T divided by sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8)).\n\nWait, but let me write this as:\n\n[ (cos\u03b8 +1) / sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8)), sin\u03b8 / sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8)) ) ].\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\ncos\u03b8 +1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2), since 1 + cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2).\n\nSimilarly, 2(1 + cos\u03b8) =4 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8)) )= sqrt(4 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) )= 2 |cos(\u03b8/2)|. But since \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2, cos(\u03b8/2) is positive, so it's 2 cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the first component becomes [2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ] / [2 cos(\u03b8/2) ] ) = cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nThe second component is [ sin\u03b8 ] / [2 cos(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nBut sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the second component becomes [ 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) ] / [ 2 cos(\u03b8/2) ] ) = sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but wait, this is for the eigenvalue +1. Because when we took M - I, we were looking for eigenvalues of +1. So the corresponding eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)].\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Because I've read somewhere that the spin-up state in direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) is [ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i \u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T. But in our case, \u03c6=0 because the direction is in the x-z plane. So the state is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nOption C is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which matches this. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by hbar, but I don't think those factors are correct here.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The eigenvector I found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].\n\nBut let me look at the options. Option C is exactly that: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that would be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the normalized eigenvector. So the answer is option C.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: the eigenvector could have a phase factor. But the question gives the options as real numbers. So for the muon, perhaps the spin state is real, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the general case includes the phase, but since n is in the x-z plane, phi=0, so the phase is 1, making the second component real.\n\nSo the correct normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C says ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )\n\nSo that's the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. Hmm, wait, the operator is P, and it's along some direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, operators like spin are often represented as vectors, so maybe this is about spin angular momentum?\n\nWait, the problem gives the components of the operator P. Specifically, Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is (\u0127/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So Px is (\u0127/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], Py is (\u0127/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Pz is (\u0127/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nOh, I remember that these matrices look familiar. For spin-\u00bd particles, the Pauli matrices multiplied by \u0127/2 give the components of the spin operator. So I think P is the spin operator here. So the operator in question is the spin operator along some direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, meaning that the angle \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2 or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the eigenvector we're looking for is for the operator P along n. So the operator is P\u00b7n, which would be P_x * nx + P_y * ny + P_z * nz. But since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component ny is zero. So the operator simplifies to P_x * nx + P_z * nz.\n\nBut wait, the eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. So we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2 of the operator P\u00b7n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this operator as proportional to the Pauli matrices. So let me think: the spin operator along direction n is given by (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z) multiplied by \u0127/2. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0.\n\nSo the operator becomes (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) * (\u0127/2).\n\nHmm, \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the operator P\u00b7n is (n_x * \u03c3_x + n_z * \u03c3_z) * (\u0127/2).\n\nSo the matrix for P\u00b7n would be:\n\n(\u0127/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]\n\nBecause when you multiply the matrices: \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], multiplied by n_x gives [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]. \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]] multiplied by n_z gives [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]. Adding them together gives [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].\n\nSo the matrix for P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is:\n\n(P\u00b7n) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>\n\nWhich, substituting the matrix, becomes:\n\n(\u0127/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = (\u0127/2) [a; b]\n\nWait, let me write this without the (\u0127/2) factor for simplicity. Let me divide both sides by (\u0127/2):\n\n[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = [a; b]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn_z a + n_x b = a\nn_x a - n_z b = b\n\nLet me rearrange these equations.\n\nFrom the first equation:\nn_z a + n_x b = a \u2192 (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0\n\nFrom the second equation:\nn_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0 \u2192 n_x a = (n_z +1) b \u2192 a = [(n_z +1)/n_x] b, assuming n_x is not zero.\n\nWait, but let's think about this. The direction n is in the x-z plane, so n_x and n_z are such that n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 = 1 (assuming it's a unit vector). So perhaps we can parameterize n in terms of an angle \u03b8. Let me say that n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis. So \u03b8=0 is along z, \u03b8=\u03c0/2 is along x.\n\nSo substituting n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nThen the first equation becomes:\n\n(cos\u03b8 - 1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n\nThe second equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 + 1) b = 0\n\nSo, from the second equation: sin\u03b8 a = (cos\u03b8 +1) b \u2192 a = [(cos\u03b8 +1)/ sin\u03b8] b\n\nBut wait, let's substitute a from the second equation into the first.\n\nFrom second equation: a = [(cos\u03b8 + 1)/ sin\u03b8] b.\n\nSubstitute into first equation:\n\n(cos\u03b8 - 1) * [ (cos\u03b8 +1)/ sin\u03b8 * b ] + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n\nLet me compute the first term:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1)(cos\u03b8 +1) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 -1 = -sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n[ (-sin\u00b2\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 ] b + sin\u03b8 b = 0 \u2192 [ - sin\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 ] b = 0 \u2192 0 =0.\n\nSo that's consistent. So the equations are dependent, so we can just use the second equation to express a in terms of b.\n\nSo a = [ (cos\u03b8 +1)/ sin\u03b8 ] b.\n\nBut we can write this as a = [ (1 + cos\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 ] b.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can write this in terms of tan(\u03b8/2) because 1 + cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So,\n\n(1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] ) = [ cos(\u03b8/2) ] / [ sin(\u03b8/2) ] = cot(\u03b8/2) = tan(\u03c0/2 - \u03b8/2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the ratio a/b as (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8.\n\nBut perhaps another approach would be better. Let me think about the eigenvectors of spin operators. For a spin-\u00bd particle, the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along the direction n. The spin-up state for direction n has eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nWait, the eigenvector for spin-up along direction n can be written in terms of the eigenstates of S_z. Let me recall that for a spin-\u00bd particle, the state |+n> can be written as:\n\n|+n> = cos(\u03b8/2) |\u2191> + e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) |\u2193>\n\nBut wait, in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so \u03c6=0 because it's in the x-z plane. So the state becomes:\n\n|+n> = cos(\u03b8/2) |\u2191> + sin(\u03b8/2) |\u2193>\n\nBut wait, |\u2191> is [1; 0], |\u2193> is [0;1]. So the vector would be [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nWait, but that's only if the state is in the x-z plane, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the state is given as [ sqrt( (1 + cos\u03b8)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - cos\u03b8)/2 ) ].\n\nWait, I think I should compute the eigenvector for the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. Let me write this matrix as:\n\nM = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]\n\nThe eigenvalues of M would be the solutions to det(M - \u03bb I) =0.\n\nSo det( [[n_z - \u03bb, n_x], [n_x, -n_z - \u03bb] ]) = (n_z - \u03bb)(-n_z - \u03bb) - n_x^2 = 0.\n\nExpanding:\n\n(-n_z^2 - \u03bb n_z + \u03bb n_z + \u03bb^2) - n_x^2 = 0 \u2192 (-n_z^2 + \u03bb^2) - n_x^2 = 0 \u2192 \u03bb^2 = n_z^2 + n_x^2.\n\nBut since n is a unit vector, n_z^2 + n_x^2 =1. So \u03bb^2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=\u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues for P\u00b7n would be (\u0127/2)*1 and (\u0127/2)*(-1), i.e., \u00b1\u0127/2.\n\nSo for the eigenvalue +1 (after dividing by (\u0127/2)), the eigenvector satisfies (M - I)|v> =0.\n\nSo M - I is [[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0\n\nn_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0\n\nWait, let me write the first equation:\n\n(n_z - 1) a + n_x b =0 \u2192 (n_z -1) a = -n_x b \u2192 a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b.\n\nBut from the second equation:\n\nn_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0 \u2192 n_x a = (n_z +1) b \u2192 a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.\n\nSo combining the two expressions for a:\n\n[ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.\n\nAssuming b \u22600,\n\n- n_x^2 / (n_z -1) = (n_z +1)\n\nMultiply both sides by (n_z -1):\n\n- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) \u2192 -n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1.\n\nBut since n_x^2 +n_z^2=1, n_z^2 = 1 -n_x^2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n- n_x^2 = (1 -n_x^2) -1 \u2192 -n_x^2 = -n_x^2 \u2192 0=0.\n\nSo the equations are consistent, and we can choose a ratio. Let's take a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [ (n_z +1), n_x ]^T. Because a = [(n_z +1)/n_x] b \u2192 [a; b] = [ (n_z +1)/n_x * b; b ] = b [ (n_z +1)/n_x ; 1 ].\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [ (n_z +1), n_x ]^T multiplied by some scalar.\n\nWait, but let's compute this in terms of \u03b8.\n\nSince n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the vector becomes [ (cos\u03b8 +1), sin\u03b8 ]^T.\n\nTo normalize this, we compute the norm squared: (cos\u03b8 +1)^2 + sin^2\u03b8.\n\nExpanding (cos\u03b8 +1)^2 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 cos\u03b8 +1.\n\nAdding sin\u00b2\u03b8: cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 cos\u03b8 +1 = 1 + 2 cos\u03b8 +1 = 2(1 + cos\u03b8).\n\nSo the norm is sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8)).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ (cos\u03b8 +1), sin\u03b8 ]^T divided by sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8)).\n\nWait, but let me write this as:\n\n[ (cos\u03b8 +1) / sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8)), sin\u03b8 / sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8)) ) ].\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\ncos\u03b8 +1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2), since 1 + cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2).\n\nSimilarly, 2(1 + cos\u03b8) =4 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8)) )= sqrt(4 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) )= 2 |cos(\u03b8/2)|. But since \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2, cos(\u03b8/2) is positive, so it's 2 cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the first component becomes [2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ] / [2 cos(\u03b8/2) ] ) = cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nThe second component is [ sin\u03b8 ] / [2 cos(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nBut sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the second component becomes [ 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) ] / [ 2 cos(\u03b8/2) ] ) = sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but wait, this is for the eigenvalue +1. Because when we took M - I, we were looking for eigenvalues of +1. So the corresponding eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)].\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Because I've read somewhere that the spin-up state in direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) is [ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i \u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T.

So the answer is option C.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: the eigenvector could have a phase factor. But the question gives the options as real numbers. So for the muon, perhaps the spin state is real, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the general case includes the phase, but since n is in the x-z plane, phi=0, so the phase is 1, making the second component real.\n\nSo the correct normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C says ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )\n\nSo that's the correct answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\vec{n}$ and the z-axis.\n\n### Step 1: Construct the operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$\nThe operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ is given by:\n\\[\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z\n\\]\nSubstituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n\\[\nP_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nand $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, we get:\n\\[\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation\nThe eigenvalue equation is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\right) \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nDividing through by $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, the eigenvalue equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to the system of equations:\n\\[\n(\\cos\\theta - 1)a + \\sin\\theta b = 0, \\quad \\sin\\theta a - (\\cos\\theta + 1)b = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for the eigenvector\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[\n\\sin\\theta a = (\\cos\\theta + 1)b \\implies a = \\frac{\\cos\\theta + 1}{\\sin\\theta} b\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the first equation confirms consistency. The eigenvector is proportional to:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} \\propto \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta + 1 \\\\ \\sin\\theta \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector\nThe norm of the eigenvector is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(\\cos\\theta + 1)^2 + \\sin^2\\theta} = \\sqrt{2(1 + \\cos\\theta)}\n\\]\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\cos\\theta + 1}{\\sqrt{2(1 + \\cos\\theta)}} \\\\ \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\sqrt{2(1 + \\cos\\theta)}} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nUsing trigonometric identities, this simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the options\n- **Option A**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ is incorrect as it does not match the derived eigenvector.\n- **Option B**: $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin(\\theta))$ is incorrect because it does not match the normalized eigenvector derived above.\n- **Option C**: $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.\n- **Option D**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin(\\theta/2))$ is incorrect as it introduces incorrect normalization factors.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nThe problem says that the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. So I'm looking for an eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\nWait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. So I think P is the vector operator, meaning P = P_x x-hat + P_y y-hat + P_z z-hat. But since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So the direction vector n can be written as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), right? Because in spherical coordinates, \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis.\n\nSo the operator in the direction n would be P\u00b7n\u0302, which is P_x sin\u03b8 + P_z cos\u03b8. Because the y-component is zero, so we can ignore P_y in this case.\n\nNow, I need to compute the matrix form of this operator. Let's write each component.\n\nFirst, P_x is (\u0127/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. So that's like the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_z is (\u0127/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix. So when we take sin\u03b8 times P_x and cos\u03b8 times P_z, we'll have:\n\nP\u00b7n\u0302 = (\u0127/2) [ sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]\n\nLet me compute that matrix. So the (1,1) element is (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 * 1, since the diagonal of P_z is 1 and 0 in P_x. The (1,2) and (2,1) elements are (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8. The (2,2) element is (\u0127/2) (-cos\u03b8) because P_z has -1 there.\n\nSo the matrix looks like:\n\n[[ (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8, (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ],\n [ (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8, -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ] ]\n\nNow, this is the operator we need to find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:\n\nP\u00b7n\u0302 |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>\n\nWait, no, actually, the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. So we have:\n\nP\u00b7n\u0302 |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>\n\nLet me write that in matrix terms. Let me denote |\u03c8> as a column vector [a; b]. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n[ [ (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8, (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ],\n  [ (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8, -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ] ] * [a; b] = (\u0127/2) [a; b]\n\nLet me multiply this out.\n\nThe first component equation is:\n\n(\u0127/2 cos\u03b8) a + (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8) b = (\u0127/2) a\n\nDivide both sides by \u0127/2:\n\ncos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b = a\n\nSimilarly, the second component:\n\n(\u0127/2 sin\u03b8) a + (-\u0127/2 cos\u03b8) b = (\u0127/2) b\n\nAgain, divide by \u0127/2:\n\nsin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b = b\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) cos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b = a \u2192 (cos\u03b8 - 1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n\n2) sin\u03b8 a + (-cos\u03b8 -1) b = 0 \u2192 sin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nWait, equation 1: (cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n\nEquation 2: sin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can solve these equations. Let me write equation 1 as:\n\n[ (cos\u03b8 -1) ] a + [ sin\u03b8 ] b = 0 \u2192 equation (1)\n\nEquation 2:\n\n[ sin\u03b8 ] a + [ - (cos\u03b8 + 1) ] b = 0 \u2192 equation (2)\n\nSo, from equation (1), I can express a in terms of b or vice versa. Let's solve equation (1) for a.\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) a = - sin\u03b8 b \u2192 a = [ - sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 -1) ] b\n\nHmm, simplifying the denominator: cos\u03b8 -1 = -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) because cos\u03b8 = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2). So cos\u03b8 -1 = -2 sin\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSimilarly, sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).\n\nSo a = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / (-2 sin\u00b2(theta/2)) ) ] b\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nThe negatives cancel, 2 cancels with 2, sin(theta/2) cancels once from numerator and denominator.\n\nSo a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b \u2192 a = cot(theta/2) b\n\nAlternatively, a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b = [ cot(theta/2) ] b\n\nSo, let me express a as cot(theta/2) times b. Let's set b = 1 for simplicity (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple), then a = cot(theta/2).\n\nWait, but wait, let's check equation 2 with this.\n\nEquation 2 is:\n\nsin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b =0\n\nSubstituting a = cot(theta/2) * b.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)\n\ncot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)\n\nSo a = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] b\n\nSo equation 2 becomes:\n\n[ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] * [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) b ] - [ (cos\u03b8 +1) ] b = 0\n\nSimplify the first term:\n\n2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) b - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nFactor out b:\n\n[ 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) - (cos\u03b8 +1) ] b = 0\n\nWe know that cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) -1, so cos\u03b8 +1 = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2)\n\nSubstituting:\n\n2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) - 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) = 0 \u2192 0 =0.\n\nSo equation 2 is satisfied as long as equation 1 is. So we only have to satisfy equation 1, which gives a relationship between a and b.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [a; b] where a = cot(theta/2) * b. Let me write this as [a; b] = [cot(theta/2); 1] multiplied by b. Wait, but I can factor out b. So the vector can be written as:\n\n[cot(theta/2), 1]^T.\n\nBut we can also write this in terms of sin and cos.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to parameterize the eigenvector in terms of an angle. Let me think.\n\nWait, let's consider a general state |\u03c8> = [a; b]. The condition is that a = cot(theta/2) * b.\n\nSo let's write a = cot(theta/2) b.\n\nWe can factor out b:\n\n|\u03c8> = b [ cot(theta/2) ; 1 ]\n\nBut since the eigenvector is defined up to a scalar, we can set b to any value, say b=1, then a = cot(theta/2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express this in terms of a single parameter. Let's express the vector in terms of angles.\n\nAnother approach: the eigenvector should be along the direction of the eigenvalue. Wait, but since it's the eigenstate for +\u0127/2, perhaps it's related to the spin-up state along direction n.\n\nIn spin systems, the eigenvectors for spin along a direction can be written in terms of spherical harmonics or using the Euler angles. Alternatively, perhaps using the z-x-z decomposition, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, another thought. The eigenstates of the Pauli matrices are well-known. For example, the eigenstates of \u03c3_x are |+x> = 1/sqrt(2) [1; 1] and |\u2212x> = 1/sqrt(2) [1; -1].\n\nSimilarly, for \u03c3_z, the eigenstates are |+z> = [1; 0], |\u2212z> = [0; 1].\n\nBut in this problem, the operator is a combination of \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z. So perhaps the eigenstate is a superposition of |+x> and |+z> and |\u2212x> and |\u2212z>?\n\nWait, but the operator here is (\u0127/2)( sin\u03b8 \u03c3_x + cos\u03b8 \u03c3_z ). So it's a linear combination of \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z.\n\nThe eigenstates of such an operator can be found by diagonalizing this matrix. Alternatively, perhaps using the method of finding the eigenvectors directly, as I did earlier.\n\nWait, earlier I found that the eigenvector satisfies a = cot(theta/2) b.\n\nSo, let me write the eigenvector as [a; b] = [ cot(theta/2) b; b ].\n\nWe can factor out b, so the vector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2); 1 ].\n\nBut to normalize this, we compute the norm:\n\n|a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(theta/2)|^2 + 1.\n\nWait, but since theta is an angle, it's between 0 and pi, so theta/2 is between 0 and pi/2, so cot(theta/2) is real and positive when theta is in (0, pi), which it is.\n\nSo the norm squared is cot\u00b2(theta/2) + 1.\n\nWe can write cot\u00b2(theta/2) + 1 = csc\u00b2(theta/2) because 1 + cot\u00b2 x = csc\u00b2 x.\n\nSo the norm is csc(theta/2) = 1/sin(theta/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) / (1/sin(theta/2)) ), 1/(1/sin(theta/2)) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\ncot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so cot(theta/2) / (1/sin(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2).\n\nAnd 1/(1/sin(theta/2)) ) = sin(theta/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, that's a very neat result. So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nBut wait, let me check the signs. Because when we found a = cot(theta/2) b, and the eigenvector is [a; b], when we normalize, it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, that seems right because when theta is 0, the direction is along z. The eigenvector for +1/2 in sigma_z is [1;0], which corresponds to cos(0/2) =1, sin(0/2)=0. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, when theta is pi, the direction is along negative z. The eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. Wait, wait, let me think. If theta is pi, then the operator becomes (\u0127/2)(0*sigma_x + (-1) sigma_z), so P\u00b7n = - (\u0127/2) sigma_z. The eigenvalue equation would be (-\u0127/2 sigma_z) |psi> = (\u0127/2) |psi> \u2192 sigma_z |psi> = - |psi>, which would be the state [0;1], but according to our formula, when theta=pi, cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1. So the vector is [0;1], which is correct. So that's good.\n\nSimilarly, when theta is pi/2, the direction is along x. The eigenvector would be [1;1]/sqrt(2), which is cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2. So [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which matches.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem is in the x-z plane, so phi (the azimuthal angle) is zero. So the state is a function of theta only.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's exactly what I found.\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but that's in spherical coordinates, but perhaps for spin-1/2 systems, but I don't think that's the case here. The given operator is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero, so e^{i phi} is 1, but the components would be cos(theta) and sin(theta), which doesn't match our result.\n\nOption D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, but that depends on theta, which isn't present in our result.\n\nOption A has factors of hbar, but I don't think the eigenvector has hbar in its components. Because the eigenvectors are dimensionless; operators have units of \u0127.\n\nWait, but the options are given in terms of hbar. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the options:\n\nOption A: (sqrt(2/3) \u0127, sqrt(1/3) \u0127 )\n\nBut that would imply that the vector has components proportional to \u0127, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So probably not.\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result.\n\nWait, but wait the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the state is in the eigenstate of P\u00b7n with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n",

Then, the equation becomes:\n\n[ [ (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8, (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ],\n  [ (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8, -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ] ] * [a; b] = (\u0127/2) [a; b]\n\nLet me multiply this out.\n\nThe first component equation is:\n\n(\u0127/2 cos\u03b8) a + (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8) b = (\u0127/2) a\n\nDivide both sides by \u0127/2:\n\ncos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b = a\n\nSimilarly, the second component:\n\n(\u0127/2 sin\u03b8) a + (-\u0127/2 cos\u03b8) b = (\u0127/2) b\n\nAgain, divide by \u0127/2:\n\nsin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b = b\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) cos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b = a \u2192 (cos\u03b8 - 1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n\n2) sin\u03b8 a + (-cos\u03b8 -1) b = 0 \u2192 sin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nWait, equation 1: (cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\n\nEquation 2: sin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can solve these equations. Let me write equation 1 as:\n\n[ (cos\u03b8 -1) ] a + [ sin\u03b8 ] b = 0 \u2192 equation (1)\n\nEquation 2:\n\n[ sin\u03b8 ] a + [ - (cos\u03b8 + 1) ] b = 0 \u2192 equation (2)\n\nSo, from equation (1), I can express a in terms of b or vice versa. Let's solve equation (1) for a.\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) a = - sin\u03b8 b \u2192 a = [ - sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 -1) ] b\n\nHmm, simplifying the denominator: cos\u03b8 -1 = -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) because cos\u03b8 = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2). So cos\u03b8 -1 = -2 sin\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSimilarly, sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).\n\nSo a = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / (-2 sin\u00b2(theta/2)) ) ] b\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nThe negatives cancel, 2 cancels with 2, sin(theta/2) cancels once from numerator and denominator.\n\nSo a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b \u2192 a = cot(theta/2) b\n\nAlternatively, a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b = [ cot(theta/2) ] b\n\nSo, let me express a as cot(theta/2) times b. Let's set b = 1 for simplicity (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple), then a = cot(theta/2).\n\nWait, but wait, let's check equation 2 with this.\n\nEquation 2 is:\n\nsin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b =0\n\nSubstituting a = cot(theta/2) * b.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)\n\ncot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)\n\nSo a = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] b\n\nSo equation 2 becomes:\n\n[ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] * [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) b ] - [ (cos\u03b8 +1) ] b = 0\n\nSimplify the first term:\n\n2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) b - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nFactor out b:\n\n[ 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) - (cos\u03b8 +1) ] b = 0\n\nWe know that cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) -1, so cos\u03b8 +1 = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2)\n\nSubstituting:\n\n2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) - 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) = 0 \u2192 0 =0.\n\nSo equation 2 is satisfied as long as equation 1 is. So we only have to satisfy equation 1, which gives a relationship between a and b.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [a; b] where a = cot(theta/2) * b. Let me write this as [a; b] = [cot(theta/2); 1] multiplied by b. Wait, but I can factor out b. So the vector can be written as:\n\n[cot(theta/2), 1]^T.\n\nBut we can also write this in terms of sin and cos.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to parameterize the eigenvector in terms of an angle. Let me think.\n\nWait, let's consider a general state |\u03c8> = [a; b]. The condition is that a = cot(theta/2) * b.\n\nSo let's write a = cot(theta/2) b.\n\nWe can factor out b:\n\n|\u03c8> = b [ cot(theta/2) ; 1 ]\n\nBut since the eigenvector is defined up to a scalar, we can set b to any value, say b=1, then a = cot(theta/2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express this in terms of a single parameter. Let's express the vector in terms of angles.\n\nAnother approach: the eigenvector should be along the direction of the eigenvalue. Wait, but since it's the eigenstate for +\u0127/2, perhaps it's related to the spin-up state along direction n.\n\nIn spin systems, the eigenvectors for spin along a direction can be written in terms of spherical harmonics or using the Euler angles. Alternatively, perhaps using the z-x-z decomposition, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, another thought. The eigenstates of the Pauli matrices are well-known. For example, the eigenstates of \u03c3_x are |+x> = 1/sqrt(2) [1; 1] and |\u2212x> = 1/sqrt(2) [1; -1].\n\nSimilarly, for \u03c3_z, the eigenstates are |+z> = [1; 0], |\u2212z> = [0; 1].\n\nBut in this problem, the operator is a combination of \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z. So perhaps the eigenstate is a superposition of |+x> and |+z> and |\u2212x> and |\u2212z>?\n\nWait, but the operator here is (\u0127/2)( sin\u03b8 \u03c3_x + cos\u03b8 \u03c3_z ). So it's a linear combination of \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z.\n\nThe eigenstates of such an operator can be found by diagonalizing this matrix. Alternatively, perhaps using the method of finding the eigenvectors directly, as I did earlier.\n\nWait, earlier I found that the eigenvector satisfies a = cot(theta/2) b.\n\nSo, let me write the eigenvector as [a; b] = [ cot(theta/2) b; b ].\n\nWe can factor out b, so the vector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2); 1 ].\n\nBut to normalize this, we compute the norm:\n\n|a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(theta/2)|^2 + 1.\n\nWait, but since theta is an angle, it's between 0 and pi, so theta/2 is between 0 and pi/2, so cot(theta/2) is real and positive when theta is in (0, pi), which it is.\n\nSo the norm squared is cot\u00b2(theta/2) + 1.\n\nWe can write cot\u00b2(theta/2) + 1 = csc\u00b2(theta/2) because 1 + cot\u00b2 x = csc\u00b2 x.\n\nSo the norm is csc(theta/2) = 1/sin(theta/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) / (1/sin(theta/2)) ), 1/(1/sin(theta/2)) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\ncot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so cot(theta/2) / (1/sin(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2).\n\nAnd 1/(1/sin(theta/2)) ) = sin(theta/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, that's a very neat result. So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nBut wait, let me check the signs. Because when we found a = cot(theta/2) b, and the eigenvector is [a; b], when we normalize, it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, that seems right because when theta is 0, the direction is along z. The eigenvector for +1/2 in sigma_z is [1;0], which corresponds to cos(0/2) =1, sin(0/2)=0. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, when theta is pi, the direction is along negative z. The eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. Wait, wait, let me think. If theta is pi, then the operator becomes (\u0127/2)(0*sigma_x + (-1) sigma_z), so P\u00b7n = - (\u0127/2) sigma_z. The eigenvalue equation would be (-\u0127/2 sigma_z) |psi> = (\u0127/2) |psi> \u2192 sigma_z |psi> = - |psi>, which would be the state [0;1], but according to our formula, when theta=pi, cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1. So the vector is [0;1], which is correct. So that's good.\n\nSimilarly, when theta is pi/2, the direction is along x. The eigenvector would be [1;1]/sqrt(2), which is cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2. So [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which matches.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem is in the x-z plane, so phi (the azimuthal angle) is zero. So the state is a function of theta only.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's exactly what I found.\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but that's in spherical coordinates, but perhaps for spin-1/2 systems, but I don't think that's the case here. The given operator is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero, so e^{i phi} is 1, but the components would be cos(theta) and sin(theta), which doesn't match our result.\n\nOption D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, but that depends on theta, which isn't present in our result.\n\nOption A has factors of hbar, but I don't think the eigenvector has hbar in its components. Because the eigenvectors are dimensionless; operators have units of \u0127.\n\nWait, but the options are given in terms of hbar. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the options:\n\nOption A: (sqrt(2/3) \u0127, sqrt(1/3) \u0127 )\n\nBut that would imply that the vector has components proportional to \u0127, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So probably not.\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result.\n\nWait, but wait the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the state is in the eigenstate of P\u00b7n with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \\times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\\hbar/2$. Since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the direction vector can be written as $(\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, and the operator in this direction is $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\hat{n} = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$.\n\n### Step 1: Construct the matrix for $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\hat{n}$\nThe components of $\\vec{P}$ are:\n- $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli X matrix),\n- $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Z matrix).\n\nThe operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\hat{n}$ is:\n\\[\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\hat{n} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right).\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\hat{n} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation\nThe eigenvalue equation is:\n\\[\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\hat{n} \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nSubstituting the matrix for $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\hat{n}$, we get two equations:\n1. $\\cos\\theta \\, a + \\sin\\theta \\, b = a$,\n2. $\\sin\\theta \\, a - \\cos\\theta \\, b = b$.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\\[\n(\\cos\\theta - 1) a + \\sin\\theta \\, b = 0 \\implies a = \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) b.\n\\]\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[\n\\sin\\theta \\, a - (\\cos\\theta + 1) b = 0.\n\\]\nSubstituting $a = \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) b$ into this equation confirms that it is satisfied.\n\n### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector\nThe eigenvector is proportional to:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\sin\\theta \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nTo normalize, we compute the norm:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{|a|^2 + |b|^2} = \\sqrt{\\cot^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) + 1} = \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right).\n\\]\nThe normalized eigenvector is:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\\\ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the options\n- **Option A**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ includes $\\hbar$, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.\n- **Option B**: $(\\cos\\theta, e^{i\\phi}\\sin\\theta)$ is not consistent with the derived result, as the eigenvector depends on $\\theta/2$, not $\\theta$.\n- **Option C**: $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.\n- **Option D**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin(\\theta/2))$ introduces unnecessary coefficients and $\\hbar$, which are not present in the eigenvector.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.\n\nAnswer: C",
