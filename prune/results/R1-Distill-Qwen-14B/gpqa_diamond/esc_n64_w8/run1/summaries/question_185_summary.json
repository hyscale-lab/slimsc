      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.\n\nThe problem says: Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n. Here, n is an arbitrary unit vector, \u03b5 is a constant with energy dimension, and the \u03c3 are the Pauli spin matrices. The question is asking for the eigenvalues of H.\n\nThe options are A, B, C, D with various possibilities. Hmm.\n\nI remember that the Pauli matrices are a set of three 2x2 matrices (\u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03c3z) that represent the spin-1/2 systems. Each of them has eigenvalues \u00b11. Oh wait, but wait. No, wait a second. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues of \u00b11. But when you have a Hamiltonian that's a dot product of \u03c3 with some vector, what does that mean?\n\nSo, the general form of H is \u03b5 multiplied by the dot product of \u03c3 and n. So, H = \u03b5 (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z). Since n is a unit vector, n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 = 1.\n\nI think I remember that for any spin operator like this, the eigenvalues are determined by the magnitude of the vector multiplied by some factor. Since each \u03c3 component has eigenvalues \u00b11, when you combine them into a dot product with n, the eigenvalues should be \u00b1 the magnitude of the vector multiplied by \u03b5.\n\nWait, but what's the magnitude here? The vector is (\u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z) scaled by n. But wait, n is a unit vector, so the coefficients are normalized.\n\nWait, no, the Hamiltonian is \u03b5 multiplied by the sum of n_i \u03c3_i. So each \u03c3_i is a matrix, but when you take their linear combination, the sum is a matrix whose eigenvalues are related to the magnitude of the coefficients.\n\nBut wait, for any operator of the form a\u00b7\u03c3, where a is a vector, the eigenvalues are \u00b1|a|. Because the Pauli matrices are such that when you combine them into a dot product, the resulting matrix has eigenvalues equal to the magnitude of the coefficient vector.\n\nSo in this case, a would be the vector (\u03b5 n_x, \u03b5 n_y, \u03b5 n_z). Because the operator is \u03b5 multiplied by each component. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 (n \u00b7 \u03c3). So it's like H = \u03b5 (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z). So the vector a in the operator a \u00b7 \u03c3 is (\u03b5 n_x, \u03b5 n_y, \u03b5 n_z). But since n is a unit vector, the magnitude |a| would be sqrt( (\u03b5 n_x)^2 + (\u03b5 n_y)^2 + (\u03b5 n_z)^2 ) = \u03b5 sqrt(n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 ) = \u03b5 * 1 = \u03b5.\n\nWait, because n is a unit vector, so the square root of the sum is 1. So the magnitude |a| is \u03b5. Therefore, the eigenvalues should be \u00b1\u03b5. So the eigenvalues are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is \"+\u03b5, -\u03b5\". Option C is \u00b1 \u03b5 \u0127/2, which I don't think is correct because I don't see where the \u0127 would come in here. The problem says \u03b5 has energy dimension, so perhaps the eigenvalues are just \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about the Pauli matrices again. Each \u03c3_i has eigenvalues \u00b11, but when you have a sum, it's not simply additive because they don't commute. So when you have a spin operator in an arbitrary direction, the eigenvalues are \u00b1 the magnitude of the operator. So the eigenvalues of a\u00b7\u03c3 are \u00b1|a|.\n\nIn this case, a is (\u03b5 n_x, \u03b5 n_y, \u03b5 n_z), so |a| is sqrt( (\u03b5 n_x)^2 + (\u03b5 n_y)^2 + (\u03b5 n_z)^2 ) = \u03b5 * sqrt(n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z^2 ) = \u03b5 * 1 = \u03b5. So yes, the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given as H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, where \u03b5 is an energy constant, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and \u03c3 represents the Pauli spin matrices. Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z, and each is a 2x2 matrix.\n\nWait, \u03c3 \u00b7 n is the dot product of the vector of Pauli matrices with the unit vector n. So that would be \u03c3_x n_x + \u03c3_y n_y + \u03c3_z n_z. Oh right, that's a matrix expression. So H is a 2x2 matrix because each Pauli matrix is 2x2.\n\nNow, I'm trying to find the eigenvalues of H. I know that for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. Or wait, another approach: since the Pauli matrices are involved, maybe there's a property I can use.\n\nI remember that each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11. But wait, when you take a linear combination like \u03c3 \u00b7 n, what does that look like? Oh, right, \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a matrix proportional to the spin operator in a particular direction.\n\nWait, another thought: the trace of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. For any Pauli matrix \u03c3_i, the trace is zero because, for example, \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so trace is 0. So each \u03c3_i has trace 0. Therefore, \u03c3 \u00b7 n will also have trace 0 since it's a sum of matrices each with trace 0 multiplied by components of n, which sum to 1 (since n is a unit vector). Wait, no, n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 =1. But each term \u03c3_i is multiplied by n_i, so the trace of \u03c3\u00b7n would be n_x * trace(\u03c3_x) + n_y * trace(\u03c3_y) + n_z * trace(\u03c3_z) = 0. So the trace of H is zero.\n\nThe trace is the sum of the eigenvalues. So if the eigenvalues are \u03bb_1 and \u03bb_2, then \u03bb_1 + \u03bb_2 = 0. So they must be negatives of each other.\n\nNow, what about the determinant? The determinant of H would be (\u03b5^2)(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) multiplied by some factors? Wait, wait, no. Let me think. The Pauli matrices are each traceless and have determinant -1. Because \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], determinant is (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1. Same for \u03c3_y and \u03c3_z. So each \u03c3_i has determinant -1.\n\nBut when you take \u03c3 \u00b7 n, which is a sum, it's not so straightforward. Hmm, perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, I can recall that for a spin-1/2 system, the spin operator S is (\u0127/2) \u03c3. So the Hamiltonian here is proportional to \u03c3 \u00b7 n, which would have eigenvalues \u00b1 (\u03b5/2) * something.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the general form of the eigenvalues for a spin operator in a magnetic field. Oh wait, the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be \u00b11, because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11, and \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a linear combination in the direction of n, which is just another direction. So the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n should be \u00b11. So when you multiply by \u03b5, the eigenvalues become \u00b1 \u03b5. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the operator H is \u03b5 multiplied by \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So the eigenvalues of H would be \u03b5 multiplied by the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. And since \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues \u00b11, then H's eigenvalues would be \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the properties of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. Suppose n is along the z-axis, so n = (0,0,1). Then \u03c3 \u00b7 n = \u03c3_z. The eigenvalues of \u03c3_z are +1 and -1. So H would be \u03b5 \u03c3_z, eigenvalues +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. So that seems correct.\n\nBut another way to think about it: the general form of the eigenvalues for any 2x2 matrix A is given by the solutions to det(A - \u03bb I) = 0. So for H = \u03b5 (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z), let's write this out.\n\nEach \u03c3_i is a matrix, so H is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write out the matrix:\n\nH = \u03b5 [ [n_z, n_x + i n_y],\n          [n_x - i n_y, -n_z] ]\n\nWait, no, wait. The Pauli matrices are:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\u03c3_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]\n\u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nSo \u03c3 \u00b7 n is n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z.\n\nSo substituting each:\n\nH = \u03b5 [ [n_z, n_x + i n_y],\n          [n_x - i n_y, -n_z] ]\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me compute each term:\n\nn_x \u03c3_x is n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] \u2192 [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]\n\nn_y \u03c3_y is n_y * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] \u2192 [[0, -i n_y], [i n_y, 0]]\n\nn_z \u03c3_z is n_z * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] \u2192 [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]\n\nAdding them together:\n\nThe (1,1) element is n_z.\n\n(1,2) element is n_x *1 + n_y*(-i) \u2192 n_x - i n_y.\n\n(2,1) element is n_x *1 + n_y*(i) \u2192 n_x + i n_y.\n\n(2,2) element is -n_z.\n\nSo H is:\n\n[ [n_z, n_x - i n_y],\n  [n_x + i n_y, -n_z] ]\n\nWait, no, wait. I think I made a mistake in the addition.

Let me multiply it out:\n\n(n_z \u03b5 - \u03bb)(-n_z \u03b5 - \u03bb) = (n_z \u03b5)(-n_z \u03b5) + (n_z \u03b5)(-\u03bb) + (-\u03bb)(-n_z \u03b5) + (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb)\n= -n_z^2 \u03b5^2 - n_z \u03b5 \u03bb + n_z \u03b5 \u03bb + \u03bb^2\n= -n_z^2 \u03b5^2 + \u03bb^2\n\nSo first term is \u03bb^2 - n_z^2 \u03b5^2.\n\nSecond term is (n_x \u03b5 - i n_y \u03b5)(n_x \u03b5 + i n_y \u03b5) \u2192 this is of the form (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nSo a = n_x \u03b5, b = i n_y \u03b5.\n\nSo (n_x \u03b5)^2 - (i n_y \u03b5)^2 \u2192 n_x^2 \u03b5^2 - (i^2) n_y^2 \u03b5^2 \u2192 n_x^2 \u03b5^2 - (-1) n_y^2 \u03b5^2 \u2192 n_x^2 \u03b5^2 + n_y^2 \u03b5^2.\n\nSo the determinant becomes:\n\n[\u03bb^2 - n_z^2 \u03b5^2] - [n_x^2 \u03b5^2 + n_y^2 \u03b5^2] = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\u03bb^2 - (n_z^2 + n_x^2 + n_y^2) \u03b5^2 = 0\n\nBut wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1.\n\nSo equation becomes \u03bb\u00b2 - \u03b5\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2 = \u03b5\u00b2 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b1 \u03b5.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given as H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, where \u03b5 is an energy constant, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and \u03c3 represents the Pauli spin matrices. Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z, and each is a 2x2 matrix.\n\nWait, \u03c3 \u00b7 n is the dot product of the vector of Pauli matrices with the unit vector n. So that would be \u03c3_x n_x + \u03c3_y n_y + \u03c3_z n_z. Oh right, that's a matrix expression. So H is a 2x2 matrix because each Pauli matrix is 2x2.\n\nNow, I'm trying to find the eigenvalues of H. I know that for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. Or wait, another approach: since the Pauli matrices are involved, maybe there's a property I can use.\n\nI remember that each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11. But wait, when you take a linear combination like \u03c3 \u00b7 n, what does that look like? Oh, right, \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a matrix proportional to the spin operator in a particular direction.\n\nWait, another thought: the trace of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. For any Pauli matrix \u03c3_i, the trace is zero because, for example, \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so trace is 0. So each \u03c3_i has trace 0. Therefore, \u03c3 \u00b7 n will also have trace 0 since it's a sum of matrices each with trace 0 multiplied by components of n, which sum to 1 (since n is a unit vector). Wait, no, n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 =1. But each term \u03c3_i is multiplied by n_i, so the trace of \u03c3\u00b7n would be n_x * trace(\u03c3_x) + n_y * trace(\u03c3_y) + n_z * trace(\u03c3_z) = 0. So the trace of H is zero.\n\nThe trace is the sum of the eigenvalues. So if the eigenvalues are \u03bb_1 and \u03bb_2, then \u03bb_1 + \u03bb_2 = 0. So they must be negatives of each other.\n\nNow, what about the determinant? The determinant of H would be (\u03b5^2)(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) multiplied by some factors? Wait, wait, no. Let me think. The Pauli matrices are each traceless and have determinant -1. Because \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], determinant is (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1. Same for \u03c3_y and \u03c3_z. So each \u03c3_i has determinant -1.\n\nBut when you take \u03c3 \u00b7 n, which is a sum, it's not so straightforward. Hmm, perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, I can recall that for a spin-1/2 system, the spin operator S is (\u0127/2) \u03c3. So the Hamiltonian here is proportional to \u03c3 \u00b7 n, which would have eigenvalues \u00b1 (\u03b5/2) * something.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the general form of the eigenvalues for a spin operator in a magnetic field. Oh wait, the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be \u00b11, because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11, and \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a linear combination in the direction of n, which is just another direction. So the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n should be \u00b11. So when you multiply by \u03b5, the eigenvalues become \u00b1 \u03b5. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the operator H is \u03b5 multiplied by \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So the eigenvalues of H would be \u03b5 multiplied by the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. And since \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues \u00b11, then H's eigenvalues would be \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the properties of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. Suppose n is along the z-axis, so n = (0,0,1). Then \u03c3 \u00b7 n = \u03c3_z. The eigenvalues of \u03c3_z are +1 and -1. So H would be \u03b5 \u03c3_z, eigenvalues +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. So that seems correct.\n\nBut another way to think about it: the general form of the eigenvalues for any 2x2 matrix A is given by the solutions to det(A - \u03bb I) = 0. So for H = \u03b5 (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z), let's write this out.\n\nEach \u03c3_i is a matrix, so H is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write out the matrix:\n\nH = \u03b5 [ [n_z, n_x + i n_y],\n          [n_x - i n_y, -n_z] ]\n\nWait, no, wait. The Pauli matrices are:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\u03c3_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]\n\u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nSo \u03c3 \u00b7 n is n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z.\n\nSo substituting each:\n\nH = \u03b5 [ [n_z, n_x + i n_y],\n          [n_x - i n_y, -n_z] ]\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me compute each term:\n\nn_x \u03c3_x is n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] \u2192 [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]\n\nn_y \u03c3_y is n_y * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] \u2192 [[0, -i n_y], [i n_y, 0]]\n\nn_z \u03c3_z is n_z * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] \u2192 [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]\n\nAdding them together:\n\nThe (1,1) element is n_z.\n\n(1,2) element is n_x *1 + n_y*(-i) \u2192 n_x - i n_y.\n\n(2,1) element is n_x *1 + n_y*(i) \u2192 n_x + i n_y.\n\n(2,2) element is -n_z.\n\nSo H is:\n\n[ [n_z, n_x - i n_y],\n  [n_x + i n_y, -n_z] ]\n\nWait, no, wait. I think I made a mistake in the addition. Let me recompute each element.\n\n\u03c3 \u00b7 n = n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z.\n\nSo:\n\n\u03c3 \u00b7 n = \n\n[ [n_z, n_x - i n_y],\n  [n_x + i n_y, -n_z] ]\n\nSo H = \u03b5 multiplied by that matrix.\n\nNow, to find the eigenvalues, I can compute the characteristic equation det(H - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nThe matrix H - \u03bb I is:\n\n[ [n_z \u03b5 - \u03bb, (n_x \u03b5 - i n_y \u03b5) ],\n  [ (n_x \u03b5 + i n_y \u03b5), (-n_z \u03b5 - \u03bb) ] ]\n\nThe determinant is (n_z \u03b5 - \u03bb)(-n_z \u03b5 - \u03bb) - (n_x \u03b5 - i n_y \u03b5)(n_x \u03b5 + i n_y \u03b5).\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (n_z \u03b5 - \u03bb)(-n_z \u03b5 - \u03bb) = (-n_z^2 \u03b5^2) - \u03bb n_z \u03b5 + \u03bb n_z \u03b5 + \u03bb^2 ) \u2192 simplifies to (-n_z^2 \u03b5^2) + \u03bb^2.\n\nWait, wait. Let me multiply it out:\n\n(n_z \u03b5 - \u03bb)(-n_z \u03b5 - \u03bb) = (n_z \u03b5)(-n_z \u03b5) + (n_z \u03b5)(-\u03bb) + (-\u03bb)(-n_z \u03b5) + (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb)\n= -n_z^2 \u03b5^2 - n_z \u03b5 \u03bb + n_z \u03b5 \u03bb + \u03bb^2\n= -n_z^2 \u03b5^2 + \u03bb^2\n\nSo first term is \u03bb^2 - n_z^2 \u03b5^2.\n\nSecond term is (n_x \u03b5 - i n_y \u03b5)(n_x \u03b5 + i n_y \u03b5) \u2192 this is of the form (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nSo a = n_x \u03b5, b = i n_y \u03b5.\n\nSo (n_x \u03b5)^2 - (i n_y \u03b5)^2 \u2192 n_x^2 \u03b5^2 - (i^2) n_y^2 \u03b5^2 \u2192 n_x^2 \u03b5^2 - (-1) n_y^2 \u03b5^2 \u2192 n_x^2 \u03b5^2 + n_y^2 \u03b5^2.\n\nSo the determinant becomes:\n\n[\u03bb^2 - n_z^2 \u03b5^2] - [n_x^2 \u03b5^2 + n_y^2 \u03b5^2] = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\u03bb^2 - (n_z^2 + n_x^2 + n_y^2) \u03b5^2 = 0\n\nBut wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1.\n\nSo equation becomes \u03bb\u00b2 - \u03b5\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2 = \u03b5\u00b2 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b1 \u03b5.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. That would correspond to option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the determinant calculation.\n\nWait, the determinant of H - \u03bb I is (n_z \u03b5 - \u03bb)(-n_z \u03b5 - \u03bb) - (n_x \u03b5 - i n_y \u03b5)(n_x \u03b5 + i n_y \u03b5).\n\nYes, as I did before. So the second term is (n_x \u03b5)^2 + (n_y \u03b5)^2 because (a - ib)(a + ib) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nSo the determinant equation is \u03bb\u00b2 - (n_z^2 + n_x^2 + n_y^2) \u03b5\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 \u03bb^2 = \u03b5\u00b2 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b1 \u03b5.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator and its eigenvalues. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a go.\n\nThe problem states that the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, where \u03b5 is an energy constant, n is a unit vector, and \u03c3 represents the Pauli spin matrices. The question is asking for the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, right? Each \u03c3 matrix (\u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Oh wait, no, wait. Or is it that each Pauli matrix individually has eigenvalues \u00b11, but when they're combined into a vector product like \u03c3 \u00b7 n, maybe the eigenvalues change.\n\nSo, the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a dot product of the Pauli vector with a unit vector n. That would essentially be a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. For example, if n is along the z-axis, then \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be \u03c3_z. But since n is arbitrary, it's a general direction.\n\nI think the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n would depend on the direction of n, but wait, no, because \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a 2x2 matrix, and its trace is zero (since each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector). The trace is the sum of the eigenvalues, so if the trace is zero, the eigenvalues must be \u03bb and -\u03bb. So, the sum is zero, which means the eigenvalues are symmetric around zero.\n\nWait, but what's the magnitude? I remember that for Pauli matrices, when you take \u03c3 \u00b7 n, the operator's eigenvalues are \u00b11. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11, and when you have a normalized combination (since n is a unit vector), the eigenvalues of the entire dot product should still be \u00b11. Because, for example, \u03c3_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1. If n is (0,0,1), then \u03c3\u00b7n is \u03c3_z, eigenvalues \u00b11. If n is some other direction, like (a, b, c) with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =1, then \u03c3\u00b7n would have the same eigenvalues as any component, because the direction doesn't change the magnitude of the eigenvalues.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Suppose the operator is \u03c3 \u00b7 n. The eigenvalues of this operator would be the same as any of the Pauli matrices because the direction doesn't affect the magnitude of the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues should be \u00b11.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n). So H would have eigenvalues \u03b5 times the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n. So that would make the eigenvalues +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\nLet me think about it again. Let's say n is in some direction, and the operator \u03c3\u00b7n is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z). Each of these \u03c3 matrices has eigenvalues \u00b11. But when you have a linear combination, what are the eigenvalues? Wait, for example, take \u03c3_z. Its eigenvalues are \u00b11. So if I have \u03c3\u00b7n where n is in z-direction, H would be \u03b5 \u03c3_z, eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nBut what if n is in a different direction, say, a combination like (1/\u221a3, 1/\u221a3, 1/\u221a3)? Would the eigenvalues change? Hmm, I think not because the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n are still \u00b11, regardless of the direction of n. Because the operator is a spin component in that direction, and the spin-1/2 system has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 for each component. Wait, wait a second\u2014did I make a mistake here?\n\nOh wait! Wait, the Pauli matrices are dimensionless, but when you use them in spin operators, you multiply by \u0127/2. Because the spin operator S is (\u0127/2) \u03c3. So S \u00b7 n would have eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nBut in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues \u00b11, and thus H would have eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5. So the correct eigenvalues are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \u00b11. So any linear combination like \u03c3\u00b7n, where n is a unit vector, would have eigenvalues \u00b11. Because, for any spin direction, the eigenvalues are \u00b11 when using the Pauli matrices. So when you multiply by \u03b5, the eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u03b5.\n\nSo the answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator and its eigenvalues. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a go.\n\nThe problem states that the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, where \u03b5 is an energy constant, n is a unit vector, and \u03c3 represents the Pauli spin matrices. The question is asking for the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, right? Each \u03c3 matrix (\u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Oh wait, no, wait. Or is it that each Pauli matrix individually has eigenvalues \u00b11, but when they're combined into a vector product like \u03c3 \u00b7 n, maybe the eigenvalues change.\n\nSo, the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a dot product of the Pauli vector with a unit vector n. That would essentially be a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. For example, if n is along the z-axis, then \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be \u03c3_z. But since n is arbitrary, it's a general direction.\n\nI think the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n would depend on the direction of n, but wait, no, because \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a 2x2 matrix, and its trace is zero (since each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector). The trace is the sum of the eigenvalues, so if the trace is zero, the eigenvalues must be \u03bb and -\u03bb. So, the sum is zero, which means the eigenvalues are symmetric around zero.\n\nWait, but what's the magnitude? I remember that for Pauli matrices, when you take \u03c3 \u00b7 n, the operator's eigenvalues are \u00b11. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11, and when you have a normalized combination (since n is a unit vector), the eigenvalues of the entire dot product should still be \u00b11. Because, for example, \u03c3_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1. If n is (0,0,1), then \u03c3\u00b7n is \u03c3_z, eigenvalues \u00b11. If n is some other direction, like (a, b, c) with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =1, then \u03c3\u00b7n would have the same eigenvalues as any component, because the direction doesn't change the magnitude of the eigenvalues.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Suppose the operator is \u03c3 \u00b7 n. The eigenvalues of this operator would be the same as any of the Pauli matrices because the direction doesn't affect the magnitude of the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues should be \u00b11.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n). So H would have eigenvalues \u03b5 times the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n. So that would make the eigenvalues +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\nLet me think about it again. Let's say n is in some direction, and the operator \u03c3\u00b7n is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z). Each of these \u03c3 matrices has eigenvalues \u00b11. But when you have a linear combination, what are the eigenvalues? Wait, for example, take \u03c3_z. Its eigenvalues are \u00b11. So if I have \u03c3\u00b7n where n is in z-direction, H would be \u03b5 \u03c3_z, eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nBut what if n is in a different direction, say, a combination like (1/\u221a3, 1/\u221a3, 1/\u221a3)? Would the eigenvalues change? Hmm, I think not because the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n are still \u00b11, regardless of the direction of n. Because the operator is a spin component in that direction, and the spin-1/2 system has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 for each component. Wait, wait a second\u2014did I make a mistake here?\n\nOh wait! Wait, the Pauli matrices are dimensionless, but when you use them in spin operators, you multiply by \u0127/2. Because the spin operator S is (\u0127/2) \u03c3. So S \u00b7 n would have eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nBut in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues \u00b11, and thus H would have eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5. So the correct eigenvalues are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. Option C is \u00b1 \u03b5 \u0127/2, which would be the case if the Hamiltonian were (\u03b5/2) \u03c3 \u00b7n or something like that.\n\nWait, but I should double-check.

So \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z. \n\nSince n is a unit vector, the sum of the squares of its components should be 1. So n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 = 1. That might come into play later.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 (n \u00b7 \u03c3). Now, to find the eigenvalues, I remember that for any 2x2 Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues are given by the trace over 2 and the square root of determinant terms. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by considering the properties of the Pauli matrices.\n\nWait, I also recall that the eigenvalues of a spin operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n are \u00b11. Because the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues \u00b11 when multiplied by appropriate vectors, and the dot product here scales them by n's components. So, the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n would have eigenvalues \u00b11. But wait, in this case, the Hamiltonian is multiplied by \u03b5, so H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n).\n\nSo if \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues \u00b11, then H would have eigenvalues \u03b5*(+1) and \u03b5*(-1), which are \u00b1\u03b5. That would make the eigenvalues +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Are the Pauli matrices scaled by any constants? Let me think. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues \u00b11 each, but when you take a linear combination like \u03c3 \u00b7 n, which is n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z, what are the eigenvalues then?\n\nI think the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n are indeed \u00b11. Because any such combination is a spin component along the n direction, and the spin-1/2 system has eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2, but wait, wait, no, wait. Oh wait, wait! Wait a minute, I might be mixing up some factors here. Because when we talk about spin angular momentum, the operator is (\u03c3/2) \u00b7 (\u0127 n), right? Because the spin angular momentum S is (\u0127/2) \u03c3.\n\nSo in this case, the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So perhaps the eigenvalues would be \u00b1 \u03b5, because \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues \u00b11, so multiplied by \u03b5 gives \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The Pauli matrices \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z each have eigenvalues \u00b11. So when you take \u03c3 \u00b7 n, which is a sum of each Pauli matrix multiplied by the respective component of n, which is a unit vector, the eigenvalues would still be \u00b11. Because for any unit vector n, the operator \u03c3\u00b7n is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues \u00b11.\n\nSo H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n) would have eigenvalues \u03b5*(\u00b11), which are \u00b1\u03b5. So the eigenvalues are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. So that should be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this in terms of diagonalizing the matrix. Let's suppose n is along the z-axis for simplicity. Then \u03c3\u00b7n would be \u03c3_z. The eigenvalues of \u03c3_z are +1 and -1. So H would be \u03b5 \u03c3_z, with eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5. That's the same conclusion.\n\nAnother approach: the trace of H is \u03b5 times the trace of \u03c3\u00b7n. The trace of \u03c3\u00b7n is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector. So the sum of eigenvalues would be zero. The determinant of H would be [\u03b5]^2 times determinant of (\u03c3\u00b7n). The determinant of \u03c3\u00b7n is (1)(-1) - (something cross terms?), but wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is ad - bc. Let's think about \u03c3\u00b7n as a matrix. Each Pauli matrix has determinant -I, but when you take a linear combination, it's more complicated. Alternatively, since the eigenvalues are \u00b11, the product is (1)(-1) = -1. So determinant of \u03c3\u00b7n is -1. So determinant of H is \u03b5^2 * (-1). So the eigenvalues must satisfy \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 = 0 (since trace is zero) and \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 = -\u03b5^2. So \u03bb^2 = -\u03b5^2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: Wait, the determinant of H is \u03b5^2 * (determinant of \u03c3\u00b7n). The determinant of \u03c3\u00b7n is (1)(-1) - (sum of cross terms?), but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, since the eigenvalues are \u00b11, the determinant is (1)(-1) = -1. So determinant of H is \u03b5^2 * (-1) = -\u03b5^2. The eigenvalues must multiply to -\u03b5^2, and their sum is zero (since trace of H is zero). So the eigenvalues are sqrt( (0/2)^2 + (\u03b5^2 + 0)/4 )? Wait, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, eigenvalues of H satisfy \u03bb^2 = (trace(H)/2)^2 + determinant(H). But wait, the trace is zero, so \u03bb^2 = determinant(H). So \u03bb = \u00b1 sqrt(determinant(H)). The determinant of H is [\u03b5]^2 * (det(\u03c3\u00b7n)). The determinant of \u03c3\u00b7n is (1)(-1) - (something), but wait, maybe I should compute it.\n\nWait, let me compute \u03c3\u00b7n for n = (n_x, n_y, n_z). So \u03c3\u00b7n = n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z. Let's compute its square: (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z)^2. Expanding this, each \u03c3_i squared is I (since \u03c3_x^2 = I, same for others), and the cross terms are \u03c3_i \u03c3_j + \u03c3_j \u03c3_i = 2 \u03b4_{ij} I. Wait, no, wait, \u03c3_i and \u03c3_j anticommute when i\u2260j. So (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = n_x\u00b2 I + n_y\u00b2 I + n_z\u00b2 I + sum_{i\u2260j} n_i n_j (\u03c3_i \u03c3_j + \u03c3_j \u03c3_i). Because when you square the sum, you get terms where each term is \u03c3_i \u03c3_j for i and j. \n\nWait, for i = j, the term is n_i\u00b2 \u03c3_i^2 = n_i\u00b2 I. For i\u2260j, each term is 2 n_i n_j \u03c3_i \u03c3_j. But \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = i \u03b5_ijk \u03c3_k when i\u2260j, but wait, perhaps a better approach. Alternatively, I know that (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I + (n_x n_y (\u03c3_x \u03c3_y + \u03c3_y \u03c3_x) + ... ) but wait, \u03c3_x \u03c3_y = i \u03c3_z and \u03c3_y \u03c3_x = -i \u03c3_z. So \u03c3_x \u03c3_y + \u03c3_y \u03c3_x = 0. Similarly for any i\u2260j, \u03c3_i \u03c3_j + \u03c3_j \u03c3_i = 0. So all the cross terms are zero. Therefore, (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. Since n is a unit vector, this is I.\n\nSo (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = I. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n must satisfy \u03bb^2 = 1. So \u03bb is \u00b11. So the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n are \u00b11, and therefore the eigenvalues of H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n are \u00b1 \u03b5.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B: +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n",

Because for any unit vector n, the operator \u03c3\u00b7n is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues \u00b11.\n\nSo H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n) would have eigenvalues \u03b5*(\u00b11), which are \u00b1\u03b5. So the eigenvalues are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. So that should be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this in terms of diagonalizing the matrix. Let's suppose n is along the z-axis for simplicity. Then \u03c3\u00b7n would be \u03c3_z. The eigenvalues of \u03c3_z are +1 and -1. So H would be \u03b5 \u03c3_z, with eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5. That's the same conclusion.\n\nAnother approach: the trace of H is \u03b5 times the trace of \u03c3\u00b7n. The trace of \u03c3\u00b7n is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector. So the sum of eigenvalues would be zero. The determinant of H would be [\u03b5]^2 times determinant of (\u03c3\u00b7n). The determinant of \u03c3\u00b7n is (1)(-1) - (something cross terms?), but wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is ad - bc. Let's think about \u03c3\u00b7n as a matrix. Each Pauli matrix has determinant -I, but when you take a linear combination, it's more complicated. Alternatively, since the eigenvalues are \u00b11, the product is (1)(-1) = -1. So determinant of \u03c3\u00b7n is -1. So determinant of H is \u03b5^2 * (-1). So the eigenvalues must satisfy \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 = 0 (since trace is zero) and \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 = -\u03b5^2. So \u03bb^2 = -\u03b5^2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: Wait, the determinant of H is \u03b5^2 * (determinant of \u03c3\u00b7n). The determinant of \u03c3\u00b7n is (1)(-1) - (sum of cross terms?), but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, since the eigenvalues are \u00b11, the determinant is (1)(-1) = -1. So determinant of H is \u03b5^2 * (-1) = -\u03b5^2. The eigenvalues must multiply to -\u03b5^2, and their sum is zero (since trace of H is zero). So the eigenvalues are sqrt( (0/2)^2 + (\u03b5^2 + 0)/4 )? Wait, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, eigenvalues of H satisfy \u03bb^2 = (trace(H)/2)^2 + determinant(H). But wait, the trace is zero, so \u03bb^2 = determinant(H). So \u03bb = \u00b1 sqrt(determinant(H)). The determinant of H is [\u03b5]^2 * (det(\u03c3\u00b7n)). The determinant of \u03c3\u00b7n is (1)(-1) - (something), but wait, maybe I should compute it.\n\nWait, let me compute \u03c3\u00b7n for n = (n_x, n_y, n_z). So \u03c3\u00b7n = n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z. Let's compute its square: (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z)^2. Expanding this, each \u03c3_i squared is I (since \u03c3_x^2 = I, same for others), and the cross terms are \u03c3_i \u03c3_j + \u03c3_j \u03c3_i = 2 \u03b4_{ij} I. Wait, no, wait, \u03c3_i and \u03c3_j anticommute when i\u2260j. So (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = n_x\u00b2 I + n_y\u00b2 I + n_z\u00b2 I + sum_{i\u2260j} n_i n_j (\u03c3_i \u03c3_j + \u03c3_j \u03c3_i). Because when you square the sum, you get terms where each term is \u03c3_i \u03c3_j for i and j. \n\nWait, for i = j, the term is n_i\u00b2 \u03c3_i^2 = n_i\u00b2 I. For i\u2260j, each term is 2 n_i n_j \u03c3_i \u03c3_j. But \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = i \u03b5_ijk \u03c3_k when i\u2260j, but wait, perhaps a better approach. Alternatively, I know that (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I + (n_x n_y (\u03c3_x \u03c3_y + \u03c3_y \u03c3_x) + ... ) but wait, \u03c3_x \u03c3_y = i \u03c3_z and \u03c3_y \u03c3_x = -i \u03c3_z. So \u03c3_x \u03c3_y + \u03c3_y \u03c3_x = 0. Similarly for any i\u2260j, \u03c3_i \u03c3_j + \u03c3_j \u03c3_i = 0. So all the cross terms are zero. Therefore, (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. Since n is a unit vector, this is I.\n\nSo (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = I. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n must satisfy \u03bb^2 = 1. So \u03bb is \u00b11. So the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n are \u00b11, and therefore the eigenvalues of H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n are \u00b1 \u03b5.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B: +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given as \\( H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\), where \\(\\vec{\\sigma}\\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \\(\\vec{n}\\) is a unit vector, and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. To find the eigenvalues of \\(H\\), we analyze the operator \\(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\).\n\nThe operator \\(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices: \\(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} = n_x \\sigma_x + n_y \\sigma_y + n_z \\sigma_z\\). Since \\(\\vec{n}\\) is a unit vector, \\(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1\\). The eigenvalues of \\(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\) are \\(\\pm 1\\), as this operator represents a spin component along the \\(\\vec{n}\\)-direction, and the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \\(\\pm 1\\).\n\nThe Hamiltonian \\(H = \\varepsilon (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})\\) scales the eigenvalues of \\(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\) by \\(\\varepsilon\\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \\(H\\) are \\(\\pm \\varepsilon\\).\n\nTo confirm this, we can compute \\((\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2\\). Expanding \\((\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (n_x \\sigma_x + n_y \\sigma_y + n_z \\sigma_z)^2\\), we find that the cross terms cancel due to the anticommutation relations of the Pauli matrices (\\(\\sigma_i \\sigma_j + \\sigma_j \\sigma_i = 0\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\)). This leaves \\((\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2)I = I\\), since \\(\\vec{n}\\) is a unit vector. Thus, the eigenvalues of \\(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\) satisfy \\(\\lambda^2 = 1\\), so \\(\\lambda = \\pm 1\\). Scaling by \\(\\varepsilon\\), the eigenvalues of \\(H\\) are \\(\\pm \\varepsilon\\).\n\nFrom the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n**B) \\(+\\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\\)**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator H. The given Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, where \u03c3 is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and \u03b5 is an energy constant. The options are multiple-choice, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nHmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. When you take the dot product of \u03c3 with a unit vector n, you're essentially creating a linear combination of these Pauli matrices weighted by the components of n. Since n is a unit vector, the sum of the squares of its components (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) should equal 1.\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation, right? So I need to find the eigenvalues of H. But H is proportional to \u03c3 \u00b7 n, so maybe I can find the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n first and then scale them by \u03b5.\n\nI recall that any Pauli matrix (like \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, or \u03c3_z) has eigenvalues \u00b11. But what about the general case when you have a combination like \u03c3 \u00b7 n? Since n is a unit vector, I think the eigenvalues might still be \u00b11. Because the Pauli matrices are all traceless and have determinant -1, and any linear combination with coefficients squared summing to 1 would preserve those properties.\n\nWait, let me think more carefully. The operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues \u03bb satisfy the equation (H - \u03bbI)|\u03c8> = 0. The trace of H is the sum of the eigenvalues. The trace of \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be n_z, since the trace of \u03c3_x and \u03c3_y are zero. So the trace is n_z, which is the sum of the eigenvalues. If the eigenvalues are a and b, then a + b = n_z. Also, the determinant of \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be the product of the eigenvalues. What's the determinant of \u03c3 \u00b7 n?\n\nThe Pauli matrices have determinant -1. Wait, no, wait. \u03c3_x has determinant -1. Let me check: \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so determinant is (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1. Similarly for \u03c3_y and \u03c3_z. But when you have \u03c3 \u00b7 n, which is n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z, what's its determinant?\n\nHmm, maybe I should compute the square of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. Since \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a traceless matrix? Wait, no. Because when n is a unit vector, (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z)^2. Let me compute that. Expanding it, each \u03c3_i squared is I (identity matrix), because \u03c3_i^2 = I for i=x,y,z. So (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. Since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 =1, so (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = I.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = I. That means that the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n must satisfy (\u03bb)^2 = 1, so \u03bb is either +1 or -1. So the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n are \u00b11. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n) would be \u03b5*(\u00b11) \u2192 \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. I considered the square of \u03c3 \u00b7 n, which equals the identity matrix. So the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n squared are 1, so the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n are either +1 or -1. So when multiplied by \u03b5, the eigenvalues are \u03b5 and -\u03b5. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the Hamiltonian as being proportional to a spin operator in the direction of n. The eigenvalues of the spin operator S\u00b7n are \u00b1(\u0127/2), but wait, that's if we're talking about spin-1/2 particles. But in this case, the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n, and \u03c3 is the Pauli matrices, which are related to spin but scaled by \u0127/2. Oh wait, wait a minute. Wait, the Pauli matrices \u03c3 are 2x2 matrices, and the spin operator S is (\u0127/2) \u03c3. So, S = (\u0127/2) \u03c3. \n\nIf the Hamiltonian were H = \u03b5 S\u00b7n, then H would have eigenvalues \u03b5*(\u00b1\u0127/2). But the given Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So in this case, the eigenvalues would be \u03b5*(\u00b11) * (\u0127/2) ? Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no. The spin operator S is (\u0127/2) \u03c3. So \u03c3 is 2S/\u0127. So if the Hamiltonian were H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, then substituting \u03c3 = 2S/\u0127, H = \u03b5 (2S \u00b7 n)/\u0127. The eigenvalues of S \u00b7 n are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So S\u00b7n has eigenvalues \u00b1(\u0127/2). So substituting back, H = (2 \u03b5 / \u0127) (S \u00b7 n). Then the eigenvalues would be (2 \u03b5 / \u0127) * (\u00b1 \u0127/2) ) = \u00b1 \u03b5. So that brings me back to the same conclusion as before: the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nWait, but another way: since the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n are \u00b11, then when you multiply by \u03b5, they become \u00b1\u03b5. So the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is +\u03b5 and -\u03b5, so that's the correct answer. Therefore, the answer should be option B.\n",

The eigenvalues of \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\) can be determined by considering its square: \n\n\\[\n(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})^2 = n_x^2 \\sigma_x^2 + n_y^2 \\sigma_y^2 + n_z^2 \\sigma_z^2 + \\text{cross terms}.\n\\]\n\nSince the Pauli matrices satisfy \\( \\sigma_i^2 = I \\) (the identity matrix) for \\( i = x, y, z \\), and the cross terms vanish because \\( \\vec{n} \\) is a unit vector (\\( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1 \\)), we find:\n\n\\[\n(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = I.\n\\]\n\nThis implies that the eigenvalues of \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\) must satisfy \\( \\lambda^2 = 1 \\), so the eigenvalues are \\( \\pm 1 \\). Consequently, the eigenvalues of \\( H = \\varepsilon (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}) \\) are \\( \\pm \\varepsilon \\).\n\nAmong the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n**A)** \\( +1, -1 \\) \u2014 Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \\( \\varepsilon \\).  \n**B)** \\( +\\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon \\) \u2014 Correct, matches the derived eigenvalues.  \n**C)** \\( +\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, -\\varepsilon \\hbar/2 \\) \u2014 Incorrect, introduces an unnecessary factor of \\( \\hbar/2 \\).  \n**D)** \\( +\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2 \\) \u2014 Incorrect, ignores the scaling by \\( \\varepsilon \\).\n\nThus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \\( +\\varepsilon \\) and \\( -\\varepsilon \\).\n\nAnswer: B",

Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, where \u03c3 is a vector of Pauli spin matrices, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and \u03b5 is an energy constant. Hmm, I remember that Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems, like the spin of an electron.\n\nWait, the Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z, right? Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product \u03c3 \u00b7 n would mean summing the products of each Pauli matrix component multiplied by the corresponding component of the unit vector n. So, \u03c3 \u00b7 n = \u03c3_x n_x + \u03c3_y n_y + \u03c3_z n_z. Oh right, because n is a unit vector, n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo the Hamiltonian H is a 2x2 matrix because each Pauli matrix is 2x2, and \u03b5 is just a scalar multiplier. To find the eigenvalues, I know that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way here because of the structure of the Pauli matrices.\n\nWait, I remember that any spin operator like this has eigenvalues related to the magnitude. Because the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues \u00b11, but when you take their linear combination with a unit vector, the resulting operator's eigenvalues would be the magnitude in the direction of n multiplied by some factor.\n\nWait, the Pauli matrices have the property that for any unit vector n, the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because \u03c3 \u00b7 n is essentially a spin component in the direction of n. So, for example, if n is along the z-axis, \u03c3 \u00b7 n is \u03c3_z, whose eigenvalues are +1 and -1.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n). So the eigenvalues would be \u03b5 times the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So since \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues \u00b11, H would have eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose I have H = a\u00b7(\u03c3 \u00b7 n), where a is a scalar. Then the eigenvalues of H would be a times the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. Because if you have a matrix M, and you multiply it by a scalar a, each eigenvalue is multiplied by a.\n\nSo in this case, a is \u03b5. So the eigenvalues would be +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B says +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute it more directly. Let's say the matrix \u03c3 \u00b7 n is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z). The eigenvalues of this matrix would be \u00b11 because the trace is zero (since each Pauli matrix has trace zero) and the determinant is (1)(1) - (trace/2)^2? Wait, no, wait: The determinant of \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be the product of eigenvalues, which is (-1)(1) = -1, but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, another approach: the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n are found by solving the equation (\u03c3 \u00b7 n - \u03bb I) |\u03c8> = 0. The trace of \u03c3 \u00b7 n is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, so the sum would also have trace zero. The determinant would be the product of eigenvalues. So for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues \u03bb satisfy \u03bb^2 = (trace)^2 - 2 determinant. Since trace is zero, \u03bb^2 = -2 determinant. Wait, let's compute the determinant of \u03c3 \u00b7 n.\n\nThe Pauli matrices are:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\u03c3_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]\n\u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nSo \u03c3 \u00b7 n = n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z.\n\nLet me compute the matrix elements:\n\nThe (1,1) element is n_z * 1, since \u03c3_z has 1 in (1,1). The (1,2) element is n_x - i n_y. The (2,1) element is n_x + i n_y, and (2,2) is -n_z.\n\nSo the matrix is:\n[ [n_z, n_x - i n_y],\n  [n_x + i n_y, -n_z] ]\n\nThe determinant is (n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y).\n\nCompute each part:\n\n(n_z)(-n_z) = -n_z\u00b2.\n\nThe product (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = n_x\u00b2 + (n_y)^2 (because (a - ib)(a + ib) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nSo determinant is -n_z\u00b2 - (n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2) = -(n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2) = -1, since n is a unit vector.\n\nSo the determinant is -1.\n\nThe trace is zero, so the eigenvalues \u03bb satisfy \u03bb^2 = determinant * (-2) ? Wait, no, the standard formula for eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[c, d]] is \u03bb = [trace \u00b1 sqrt(trace^2 -4 det)] / 2.\n\nIn our case, trace is zero, so \u03bb = \u00b1 sqrt( (0)^2 -4 * det ) / 2 = \u00b1 sqrt(-4 * (-1)) / 2 = \u00b1 sqrt(4) / 2 = \u00b1 2/2 = \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n are \u00b11. Then when multiplied by \u03b5, the eigenvalues become \u00b1\u03b5.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B: +\u03b5, -\u03b5.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says: Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma vector and n vector. Sigma is the Pauli spin matrices, and n is an arbitrary unit vector. Epsilon is an energy constant. We need to find the eigenvalues of H.\n\nHmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product of sigma and n would be sigma_x n_x + sigma_y n_y + sigma_z n_z. So H is epsilon multiplied by this sum.\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of a matrix are the solutions to the characteristic equation. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. But wait, for a Pauli matrix, like sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, each of them has eigenvalues +1 and -1.\n\nOh, right! Because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have determinant -1. Wait, no, the determinant of each Pauli matrix is -1. Because for sigma_x, for example, the matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], whose trace is 0 and determinant is (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of each sigma_i are +1 and -1. But H is a sum of these multiplied by components of n (which is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1) and multiplied by epsilon.\n\nWait, no. H is epsilon multiplied by (n \u00b7 sigma), which is a vector dot product. So H = epsilon (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z). So H is a 2x2 matrix, and it's a linear combination of the Pauli matrices.\n\nWhat's the eigenvalue of such a matrix? Let me think. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11, but when you take a linear combination, the eigenvalues would be scaled by epsilon times the magnitude of the coefficients. Wait, no. Because the sum of the Pauli matrices in a certain direction would have eigenvalues that depend on the direction vector.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for any unit vector n, the matrix n \u00b7 sigma has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because n \u00b7 sigma is a Hermitian matrix (since sigma_i are Hermitian and n is real) and for spin-\u00bd systems, the eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u0127/2 times the component. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the standard spin-\u00bd case, the Hamiltonian is something like H = \u03c9 \u00b7 S, where S is (\u0127/2) sigma. So the eigenvalues would be \u00b1 \u0127 \u03c9/2.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me model this. Suppose I have H = epsilon (n \u00b7 sigma). The eigenvalues of sigma \u00b7 n are \u00b11 because each Pauli matrix is traceless and squared gives identity matrix.\n\nWait, wait. Let's compute (n \u00b7 sigma)^2. Since sigma_i and sigma_j anticommute, (n \u00b7 sigma)^2 = n_x^2 sigma_x^2 + n_y^2 sigma_y^2 + n_z^2 sigma_z^2 + cross terms. But sigma_i^2 is identity matrix I for each i. So sigma_x squared is I, same for sigma_y and sigma_z. So (n \u00b7 sigma)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. But n is a unit vector, so n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 =1. Therefore, (n \u00b7 sigma)^2 = I.\n\nSo the square of the operator is the identity matrix. So the eigenvalues of (n \u00b7 sigma) must satisfy lambda^2 = 1, so lambda is \u00b11. Therefore, the eigenvalues of n \u00b7 sigma are +1 and -1.\n\nSo H is epsilon multiplied by that. So the eigenvalues of H would be epsilon * (+1) and epsilon * (-1), which are +epsilon and -epsilon.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is +epsilon and -epsilon. So the answer should be option B.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes in spin systems, you see factors of \u0127/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is written as H = epsilon (n \u00b7 sigma), and the sigma matrices are the Pauli matrices. So the eigenvalues are just \u00b1epsilon.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Another approach: The eigenvalues of H are the same as the expectation values when the spin is aligned or anti-aligned with the direction of n. The maximum eigenvalue would be when the spin is in the direction of n. For a spin-\u00bd system, the maximum eigenvalue is (epsilon) * 1 * (something). Let's think about the standard spin operator. The spin operator is S = (\u0127/2) sigma. So if H were proportional to S \u00b7 n, then the eigenvalues would be \u00b1 (epsilon) (\u0127/2). But in this problem, H is given as epsilon (n \u00b7 sigma). So it's H = epsilon (n \u00b7 sigma) = epsilon (n \u00b7 (2 S / \u0127) ), assuming S = (\u0127/2) sigma.\n\nWait, let's compute that. If S = (\u0127/2) sigma, then sigma = (2 S)/ \u0127. So H = epsilon n \u00b7 (2 S / \u0127) ) = (2 epsilon / \u0127) (n \u00b7 S). The eigenvalues of n \u00b7 S are \u00b1 (\u0127/2), so H would have eigenvalues (2 epsilon / \u0127) * (\u00b1 \u0127/2 ) ) = \u00b1 epsilon.\n\nWait, that brings us back to the same conclusion. So the eigenvalues are \u00b1epsilon.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B: +epsilon, -epsilon.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says: Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma vector and n vector. Sigma is the Pauli spin matrices, and n is an arbitrary unit vector. Epsilon is an energy constant. We need to find the eigenvalues of H.\n\nHmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product of sigma and n would be sigma_x n_x + sigma_y n_y + sigma_z n_z. So H is epsilon multiplied by this sum.\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of a matrix are the solutions to the characteristic equation. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. But wait, for a Pauli matrix, like sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, each of them has eigenvalues +1 and -1.\n\nOh, right! Because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have determinant -1. Wait, no, the determinant of each Pauli matrix is -1. Because for sigma_x, for example, the matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], whose trace is 0 and determinant is (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of each sigma_i are +1 and -1. But H is a sum of these multiplied by components of n (which is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1) and multiplied by epsilon.\n\nWait, no. H is epsilon multiplied by (n \u00b7 sigma), which is a vector dot product. So H = epsilon (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z). So H is a 2x2 matrix, and it's a linear combination of the Pauli matrices.\n\nWhat's the eigenvalue of such a matrix? Let me think. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11, but when you take a linear combination, the eigenvalues would be scaled by epsilon times the magnitude of the coefficients. Wait, no. Because the sum of the Pauli matrices in a certain direction would have eigenvalues that depend on the direction vector.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for any unit vector n, the matrix n \u00b7 sigma has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because n \u00b7 sigma is a Hermitian matrix (since sigma_i are Hermitian and n is real) and for spin-\u00bd systems, the eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u0127/2 times the component. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the standard spin-\u00bd case, the Hamiltonian is something like H = \u03c9 \u00b7 S, where S is (\u0127/2) sigma. So the eigenvalues would be \u00b1 \u0127 \u03c9/2.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me model this. Suppose I have H = epsilon (n \u00b7 sigma). The eigenvalues of sigma \u00b7 n are \u00b11 because each Pauli matrix is traceless and squared gives identity matrix.\n\nWait, wait. Let's compute (n \u00b7 sigma)^2. Since sigma_i and sigma_j anticommute, (n \u00b7 sigma)^2 = n_x^2 sigma_x^2 + n_y^2 sigma_y^2 + n_z^2 sigma_z^2 + cross terms. But sigma_i^2 is identity matrix I for each i. So sigma_x squared is I, same for sigma_y and sigma_z. So (n \u00b7 sigma)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. But n is a unit vector, so n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 =1. Therefore, (n \u00b7 sigma)^2 = I.\n\nSo the square of the operator is the identity matrix. So the eigenvalues of (n \u00b7 sigma) must satisfy lambda^2 = 1, so lambda is \u00b11. Therefore, the eigenvalues of n \u00b7 sigma are +1 and -1.\n\nSo H is epsilon multiplied by that. So the eigenvalues of H would be epsilon * (+1) and epsilon * (-1), which are +epsilon and -epsilon.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is +epsilon and -epsilon. So the answer should be option B.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes in spin systems, you see factors of \u0127/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is written as H = epsilon (n \u00b7 sigma), and the sigma matrices are the Pauli matrices. So the eigenvalues are just \u00b1epsilon.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Another approach: The eigenvalues of H are the same as the expectation values when the spin is aligned or anti-aligned with the direction of n. The maximum eigenvalue would be when the spin is in the direction of n. For a spin-\u00bd system, the maximum eigenvalue is (epsilon) * 1 * (something). Let's think about the standard spin operator. The spin operator is S = (\u0127/2) sigma. So if H were proportional to S \u00b7 n, then the eigenvalues would be \u00b1 (epsilon) (\u0127/2). But in this problem, H is given as epsilon (n \u00b7 sigma). So it's H = epsilon (n \u00b7 sigma) = epsilon (n \u00b7 (2 S / \u0127) ), assuming S = (\u0127/2) sigma.\n\nWait, let's compute that. If S = (\u0127/2) sigma, then sigma = (2 S)/ \u0127. So H = epsilon n \u00b7 (2 S / \u0127) ) = (2 epsilon / \u0127) (n \u00b7 S). The eigenvalues of n \u00b7 S are \u00b1 (\u0127/2), so H would have eigenvalues (2 epsilon / \u0127) * (\u00b1 \u0127/2 ) ) = \u00b1 epsilon.\n\nWait, that brings us back to the same conclusion. So the eigenvalues are \u00b1epsilon.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B: +epsilon, -epsilon.\n\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given as \\( H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\), where \\(\\vec{n}\\) is an arbitrary unit vector, \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a constant with energy dimensions, and \\(\\vec{\\sigma}\\) represents the Pauli spin matrices. The goal is to determine the eigenvalues of \\(H\\).\n\nThe operator \\(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices:  \n\\[\n\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} = n_x \\sigma_x + n_y \\sigma_y + n_z \\sigma_z,\n\\]  \nwhere \\(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1\\) since \\(\\vec{n}\\) is a unit vector. Each Pauli matrix (\\(\\sigma_x\\), \\(\\sigma_y\\), \\(\\sigma_z\\)) is Hermitian and has eigenvalues \\(\\pm 1\\). The eigenvalues of \\(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\) are also \\(\\pm 1\\), as it is a weighted sum of the Pauli matrices and the coefficients satisfy \\(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1\\).\n\nThe Hamiltonian \\(H\\) is \\(\\varepsilon\\) times \\(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\), so the eigenvalues of \\(H\\) are simply \\(\\varepsilon\\) times the eigenvalues of \\(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \\(H\\) are:  \n\\[\n\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon.\n\\]\n\nThis matches option **B**, which states the eigenvalues are \\(+\\varepsilon\\) and \\(-\\varepsilon\\). Other options can be ruled out as follows:  \n- Option **A** (\\(+1, -1\\)) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \\(\\varepsilon\\).  \n- Option **C** (\\(+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, -\\varepsilon \\hbar/2\\)) is incorrect because the Hamiltonian does not include a factor of \\(\\hbar/2\\).  \n- Option **D** (\\(+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2\\)) is incorrect because it does not involve \\(\\varepsilon\\).  \n\nThus, the correct answer is **B**.  \n\nAnswer: B",

But wait, when you have \u03c3 \u00b7 n, which is a combination of Pauli matrices, what's its trace and determinant?\n\nLet me think: each Pauli matrix has trace zero because the diagonal elements are 1 and -1. So when you take a linear combination, the trace would still be zero. So the trace of H would be \u03b5 times the trace of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. Since \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a sum of Pauli matrices multiplied by n's components, each Pauli matrix has trace zero, so the sum's trace is zero.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the properties of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. Oh wait, \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a spin operator in the direction of n. I think that the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n are \u00b11 because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11, and any direction would just mix them but the maximum eigenvalue is 1 and the minimum is -1. So \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues +1 and -1.\n\nSo if H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n), then the eigenvalues would be \u03b5*(+1) and \u03b5*(-1), which are \u00b1\u03b5.

Wait, for spin-\u00bd particles, S = \u0127/2 \u03c3. So if the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n, that's equivalent to (2\u03b5/\u0127) (S\u00b7n).
