      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m \u03c9\u00b2 r\u00b2. Oh right, the force here obeys Hooke's law, so this is like a 3D version of the quantum harmonic oscillator. The problem asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue.\n\nHmm, I remember that in the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, and nz, which are the principal quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, I think for the 3D case, the energy is determined by the sum of these quantum numbers plus some constant.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. But since it's isotropic, the energy only depends on the total quantum number, which is the sum of the individual ones. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the principal quantum number n. Oh wait, no, in the 3D isotropic case, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. The correct formula for the energy levels in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. Oh right, because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, so when you add them up, it's (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. So the energy depends on the sum of the three quantum numbers.\n\nSo the energy levels are quantized and the same energy is shared by all states with the same sum of quantum numbers. For example, the ground state is n=0 (sum of nx, ny, nz is 0), which gives E = (0 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (3/2) \u0127\u03c9. Then the first excited states would have sum n=1, so E = (1 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (5/2) \u0127\u03c9. The next level is sum n=2, E=(7/2) \u0127\u03c9, and so on.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the third excited state. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state, and the first excited state is the next one. So the third excited state would be the fourth energy level. Let me count: ground state is n=0 (E0), first excited is n=1 (E1), second is n=2 (E2), third is n=3 (E3). So the third excited state corresponds to n=3.\n\nSo the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. Because 3 + 3/2 is 4.5, which is 9/2. So that gives the energy part as (9/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nNow, the second part of the question: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions have this same energy eigenvalue? That is, how many distinct states (eigenfunctions) correspond to the same energy level when the sum of the quantum numbers is 3.\n\nIn other words, how many triplets (nx, ny, nz) of non-negative integers satisfy nx + ny + nz = 3. Each such triplet represents a distinct state with the same energy. The number of such triplets is the number of ways to distribute 3 quanta among 3 dimensions.\n\nWait, this is a combinatorial problem. The number of non-negative integer solutions to nx + ny + nz = 3 is given by the combination formula C(3 + 3 -1, 3) = C(5,3) = 10. Because the formula for the number of solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + xk = n is (n + k -1 choose k-1). So here, n=3, k=3, so (3+3-1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 distinct eigenfunctions for this energy level.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Each of these triplets corresponds to a different state, but some might have the same energy. But no, wait, in 3D harmonic oscillator, each state is labeled by the triplet (nx, ny, nz), and all those with the same sum have the same energy. So each such triplet is a distinct eigenfunction, but they all share the same energy. So the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is 10.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A says (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and 10, which matches what I just found. Option C has (9/2) but 3, which doesn't make sense because 3 is the ground state's multiplicity. Option B and D have other energy expressions which don't match.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. I remember that in 3D harmonic oscillator, each energy level has a certain degeneracy. For the nth level (n being the sum), the degeneracy is (n + 2 choose 2), I think. Wait, for n=0, the degeneracy is 1. For n=1, it's 3. For n=2, it's 6. For n=3, it's 10. Yes, that's correct. So the number of eigenfunctions is 10, which matches option A.\n\nSo putting it together, the energy is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. So the correct option is A.\n",

Hmm, the question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m \u03c9\u00b2 r\u00b2. I remember that in such a potential, the particle experiences a force that obeys Hooke's law, which is a restoring force proportional to the displacement, just like a spring.\n\nThe question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue.\n\nWait, so first, I need to figure out the energy levels. I recall that in three dimensions, the energy levels of a harmonic oscillator depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, but since it's isotropic, the potential is spherically symmetric, so the energy depends on the total quantum number n, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction: n = nx + ny + nz. Or wait, alternatively, in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers (n_x, n_y, n_z). So n = nx + ny + nz.\n\nWait no, I think I might have mixed up. Let me think again. In three dimensions, the energy levels are quantized as E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, so adding them up gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. So the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.\n\nNow, the states are degenerate, meaning that different combinations of (nx, ny, nz) can give the same energy. The degeneracy is given by the number of ways to write n = nx + ny + nz where nx, ny, nz are non-negative integers (since quantum numbers are non-negative). For a given n, the number of states is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2, I think. Or wait, maybe it's the number of non-negative integer solutions to nx + ny + nz = n, which is (n + 2 choose 2) = (n+2)(n+1)/2. Yes, that's right. So each energy level has a degeneracy of (n + 2)(n + 1)/2.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the third excited state. Oh, wait, what's the ground state and how excited states are counted. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is when n = 0 (nx=ny=nz=0). The first excited state would be n=1. Second excited n=2. Third excited n=3.\n\nSo the third excited state corresponds to n=3. Then, the energy is E = (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. Because E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. So that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, the number of eigenfunctions (linearly independent) for this energy eigenvalue. Since n=3, the degeneracy is (3 + 2)(3 + 1)/2 = (5)(4)/2 = 20/2 =10. So there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For n=3, the number of states is (3 + 2)(3 + 1)/2? Or wait, the formula is (n + 2)(n + 1)/2? Let's see, for n=0, it should be 1 state. Plugging in n=0: (0+2)(0+1)/2 = 2*1/2 =1. Correct. For n=1: (3)(2)/2 =3. Which is correct because when n=1, the possible states are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) \u2014 three states.\n\nn=2: (4)(3)/2 =6.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m \u03c9\u00b2 r\u00b2, which I remember is the form for a harmonic oscillator. The problem is asking for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.\n\nWait, right, the harmonic oscillator in 3D. I think in three dimensions, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. But since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy levels should depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.\n\nOh right, in 3D, the energy levels are given by E = \u0127\u03c9(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Alternatively, sometimes it's written in terms of the total quantum number n, which is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = \u0127\u03c9(n + 3/2). Wait, no, wait. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, so adding all three gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. So E = \u0127\u03c9(n + 3/2), where n = n_x + n_y + n_z.\n\nWait, but wait, in 3D, the energy levels are equally spaced with spacing \u0127\u03c9. So the ground state is n=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z =0), then first excited is n=1, second n=2, third n=3. Wait, but wait, the third excited state. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, the ground state is the lowest energy, which is the first state. The first excited state is the next higher energy, which is the second state, and so on. So the third excited state would be the fourth state in terms of increasing energy.\n\nWait, no, no. Let's think again. Ground state is the state with the lowest energy, which is n=0. The first excited state is the next possible energy level, which is n=1. Second excited would be n=2, and the third excited would be n=3. So the third excited state is the (n=3) state.\n\nWait, but wait, sometimes in such problems, the counting starts from the ground state as the first state. So, the ground state is n=0 (energy E=(3/2)\u0127\u03c9), first excited is n=1 (E=(5/2)\u0127\u03c9), second excited is n=2 (E=(7/2)\u0127\u03c9), third excited is n=3 (E=(9/2)\u0127\u03c9). So the energy for third excited state is (9/2)\u0127\u03c9.\n\nSo the first part of the question, the energy, would be (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. That's one part done.\n\nNow the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue. So for a given n, how many distinct eigenfunctions exist? Or, more accurately, how many possible sets of (n_x, n_y, n_z) give the same n, and thus the same energy.\n\nSo for n =3, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z =3.\n\nThis is a combinatorics problem. The number of solutions is (3 +3 -1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) =10. So there are 10 possible sets of quantum numbers (n_x, n_y, n_z) that sum to 3. Each of these corresponds to a different eigenfunction, but wait, are they linearly independent?\n\nWait, in 3D, the eigenfunctions are products of the 1D eigenfunctions. So for each (n_x, n_y, n_z), you get a product \u03c8_{n_x}(x) \u03c8_{n_y}(y) \u03c8_{n_z}(z). Each of these is linearly independent because they have different quantum numbers in at least one direction. So the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is 10.\n\nSo looking at the options:\n\nOption A says (9/2) \u0127\u03c9, 10. That matches both parts.\n\nOption C says 3 for the number of eigenfunctions, which is wrong because we have 10.\n\nSo the correct answer is A.\n",

For each dimension (x, y, z), the energy is (n_x + \u00bd) \u0127\u03c9, similarly for y and z. So the total energy would be (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. But since the problem is isotropic, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers. Let me denote this sum as n_total = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (n_total + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is in terms of the radial quantum number. In spherical coordinates, the energy levels can be expressed as E = (n_r + 2) \u0127\u03c9, where n_r is the radial quantum number. Wait, no, that's for the 3D hydrogen atom, I think. For the harmonic oscillator, maybe it's different. Let me get this right.\n\nIn the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are equally spaced and given by E_n = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is a non-negative integer. But wait, no, n isn't a single quantum number. Because each direction (x,y,z) contributes n_x, n_y, n_z. So n_total = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then E = (n_total + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. So the energy levels are degenerate. For a given n_total, the degeneracy is (n_total + 1)(n_total + 2)/2. Wait, is that right? Or maybe the degeneracy is (n_total + 2 choose 2) which is (n_total + 2)(n_total +1)/2. Alternatively, I remember that the number of states for a given n_total is (n_total + 2 choose 2), which is (n_total+2)(n_total+1)/2. Or maybe (n_total + 2)(n_total +1)/2 divided by something else? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of ways to write n_total as the sum of three non-negative integers.\n\nWait, the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n_total is (n_total + 2) choose 2. So that's (n_total +2)(n_total +1)/2. So the degeneracy for each energy level is (n_total + 1)(n_total + 2)/2.\n\nWait, but wait, n_total starts at 0. So for n_total = 0, E = (0 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = 3/2 \u0127\u03c9. The degeneracy is (0+1)(0+2)/2 = (1)(2)/2=1. So ground state is non-degenerate, which makes sense because in 3D isotropic oscillator, the ground state is spherically symmetric.\n\nThen for the first excited state, n_total = 1. So E = (1 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = 5/2 \u0127\u03c9. The degeneracy is (1+1)(1+2)/2 = 2*3/2=3. So three states, each with different (n_x, n_y, n_z) that sum to 1.\n\nWait, no, n_x, n_y, n_z can be 1,0,0 in any permutation. So three possible states.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem refers to the third excited state. So I need to find the energy and the degeneracy for the third excited state.\n\nWait, in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state, and each excited state is higher in energy. So the ground state is n=0 (n_total=0), first excited is n=1, second excited is n=2, third excited is n=3.\n\nWait, but wait, sometimes the counting starts at n=0 as the ground state, so the first excited state is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3.\n\nSo the third excited state would have n_total=3. So E = (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. That's 4.5 \u0127\u03c9.\n\nNow, the number of eigenfunctions for this energy level is the number of states with n_total=3. So the degeneracy is (3 +1)(3 + 2)/2 = 4*5/2=10. So there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy.\n\nLooking at the options, option A says (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and 10. So that matches.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up the quantum numbers. Another approach: the energy levels for the 3D isotropic oscillator are E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z. So each n is non-negative integer, and E depends on n = n_x + n_y + n_z.\n\nSo the ground state (n=0) has E= (0 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. First excited (n=1) E=5/2 \u0127\u03c9. Second (n=2) E=7/2 \u0127\u03c9. Third (n=3) E=9/2 \u0127\u03c9. So yes, the third excited state is E=9/2 \u0127\u03c9.\n\nThe number of states for n=3 is (3+1)(3+2)/2= (4)(5)/2=10. So that's 10 eigenfunctions.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is (9/2)\u0127\u03c9, 10. So the correct answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) (9/2) \u0127 \u03c9 , 10\n\nB) 11 pi^2 hbar^2/(2m r^2), 10\n\nC) (9/2) \u0127 \u03c9, 3\n\nD) 11 pi^2 hbar^2/(2m r^2),3\n\nSo option A is correct.\n",

The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m \u03c9\u00b2 r\u00b2, which I remember is the form for a harmonic oscillator. So this is like a 3D version of the quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about each part.\n\nFirst, the energy levels in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each dimension. Wait, in three dimensions, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, right? Or wait, maybe it's E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is the total quantum number. But wait, what's n in this case? Oh, right, in 3D, the states are often labeled by the principal quantum number n, which is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each direction contributes a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z, which are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...).\n\nThe ground state is when n=0: n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. Then the first excited state would be n=1, which could be any of the three directions. The second excited state is n=2, and so on. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the order of the states depends on the energy, right? Because each higher n gives a higher energy. So the ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, second excited is n=2, third excited is n=3. So the third excited state is the n=3 level.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me double-check. The ground state is n=0. The first excited state is the next possible energy level, which is n=1. Then the second excited is n=2, third is n=3. So yes, the third excited state is n=3.\n\nSo the energy for n=3 would be E = (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9? Wait, no. Wait, the energy formula is E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. Wait, no, wait. Each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9. So the total is the sum: (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. So when n = n_x + n_y + n_z, E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nSo for n=0, E=(0+3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = 3/2 \u0127\u03c9. For n=1, it's 5/2 \u0127\u03c9. n=2: 7/2, n=3: 9/2. So the third excited state is E = (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9? Wait, no, wait. Wait, n=3 is the third excited state? Let me count: ground is n=0, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So yes, third excited state is n=3. So the energy is (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = 9/2 \u0127\u03c9.\n\nSo the first part of the question, the energy is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. Looking at the options, option A is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9, and option C is the same energy. So that's a start.\n\nNow the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue. That is, what's the degeneracy of the n=3 state.\n\nIn three dimensions, the degeneracy depends on the number of ways to write n = n_x + n_y + n_z, where each n_i is a non-negative integer. So for n=3, we need the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.\n\nThe formula for the number of solutions is (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ) = (3+2 choose 2) ) = (5 choose 2) ) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10, which is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level.\n\nLooking at the options, option A has (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and 10, which matches. Option C has 3 for the number of functions, which is wrong. So the correct answer must be option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the degeneracy. For n=3, the possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) combinations are all the permutations where the sum is 3. Let's list them:\n\n(3,0,0): there are 3 permutations (since any of the three axes can be 3).\n(2,1,0): number of permutations is 6 (3!/(1!1!1!)) =6.\n(1,1,1): only one way, all 1's.\n\nWait, 3 + 6 + 1 =10. Yes, that's correct. So the degeneracy is 10.\n\nSo the energy is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. So the correct option is A.\n",

So that's a start.\n\nNow the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue. That is, what's the degeneracy of the n=3 state.\n\nIn three dimensions, the degeneracy depends on the number of ways to write n = n_x + n_y + n_z, where each n_i is a non-negative integer. So for n=3, we need the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.\n\nThe formula for the number of solutions is (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ) = (3+2 choose 2) ) = (5 choose 2) ) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10, which is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level.\n\nLooking at the options, option A has (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and 10, which matches. Option C has 3 for the number of functions, which is wrong. So the correct answer must be option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the degeneracy. For n=3, the possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) combinations are all the permutations where the sum is 3. Let's list them:\n\n(3,0,0): there are 3 permutations (since any of the three axes can be 3).\n(2,1,0): number of permutations is 6 (3!/(1!1!1!)) =6.\n(1,1,1): only one way, all 1's.\n\nWait, 3 + 6 + 1 =10. Yes, that's correct. So the degeneracy is 10.\n\nSo the energy is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. So the correct option is A.\n\n\nThe problem involves a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given by \\( V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2 \\). The energy levels in such a system are quantized and depend on the total quantum number \\( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \\), which is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three spatial dimensions. The energy eigenvalues are given by:\n\n\\[\nE = \\left(n + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\hbar \\omega,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer. The ground state corresponds to \\( n = 0 \\), the first excited state to \\( n = 1 \\), the second excited state to \\( n = 2 \\), and the third excited state to \\( n = 3 \\). For \\( n = 3 \\), the energy is:\n\n\\[\nE = \\left(3 + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega.\n\\]\n\nNext, the degeneracy of the \\( n = 3 \\) state is determined by the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to \\( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \\). The degeneracy is given by the combinatorial formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Degeneracy} = \\binom{n + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{3 + 2}{2} = 10.\n\\]\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega \\), and the degeneracy is 10. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**A) \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega, 10 \\)**.\n\nAnswer: A",

Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m \u03c9\u00b2 r\u00b2, which I remember is the form for a harmonic oscillator. The problem asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that energy eigenvalue.\n\nHmm, I think I remember that in a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, right, in 3D, it's better to think in terms of the number of quanta in each direction. So the energy levels are given by E = \u0127\u03c9(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), but wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, another approach: for 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy is E = \u0127\u03c9 (n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Or is it n = n_x + n_y + n_z? Oh yeah, I think that's right. So each direction contributes a quantum number, and the total n is the sum.\n\nSo the energy levels are quantized, and each level corresponds to a specific n. For example, the ground state is n=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z = 0), first excited state is n=1, which can be in any one of the three directions, and so on.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the third excited state. Let me think: the ground state is the lowest energy, which is the first state. Then the first excited state is the next, so the third excited state would be the fourth energy level. Or wait, sometimes people count from zero. Wait, no, the ground state is n=0, which is the first state. So the first excited state is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. Wait, that makes sense because each excited state increases n by 1. So the third excited state is when n=3.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So for the third excited state, n=3. So the energy is E = \u0127\u03c9 (3 + 3/2) = \u0127\u03c9 (9/2). Oh wait, because E = \u0127\u03c9 (n + 3/2), right. So n=3 gives E = (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. That's the first part of the question.\n\nNow, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy eigenvalue. So how many distinct eigenfunctions (with different quantum numbers) give the same energy when n=3?\n\nWait, because for a given n, the number of states is the number of ways to write n as n_x + n_y + n_z, where each n_x, n_y, n_z is a non-negative integer. So for n=3, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z =3.\n\nI remember that the number of such solutions is given by the combination formula (n + 3 -1 choose 3-1) ) = (3+2 choose 2) )= 5 choose 2 =10. So 10 possible ways.\n\nWait, let me think: for each possible triplet (n_x, n_y, n_z) such that they sum to 3. The possible combinations are:\n\n(3,0,0) \u2192 which can be permuted in 3 ways (since any of the three variables can be 3 and the others 0).\n\n(2,1,0) \u2192 which can be permuted in 6 ways (since choosing which variable is 2, which is 1, which is 0: 3! =6).\n\n(1,1,1) \u2192 only 1 way, since all are same.\n\nSo 3 +6 +1 =10. So yes, 10 eigenfunctions for n=3. So the energy is (9/2)\u0127\u03c9 and the number of eigenfunctions is 10.\n\nLooking at the options, option A says (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and 10. Option C says the same energy but 3, which doesn't make sense because that's the ground state maybe? Or perhaps another state.\n\nWait, the other options: B and D have different energies. B has 11 pi\u00b2... which looks like some other form, perhaps for a different potential. D has the same number of eigenfunctions as A, but different energy.

I remember that the harmonic oscillator in three dimensions is a standard problem, so I should be able to handle this.\n\nThe question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. The options are A to D, so I need to figure out which combination is correct.\n\nFirst, I'll tackle the energy part. In a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each of the three dimensions. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.\n\nWait, right. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy is given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Alternatively, sometimes the energy is written in terms of a total quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then E = (N + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nBut what's the third excited state? Oh, wait, the ground state is the lowest energy. The first excited state is the next one, then second, third. So the third excited state would be the fourth state in terms of order (since counting starts from zero perhaps? Or maybe not. Wait, I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the ground state is the lowest energy state. The first excited state is the next one, so maybe the third excited state is the fourth state in terms of energy. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about how the energy levels are filled.\n\nIn a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate. The degeneracy depends on the value of N. For a given N, the number of states is (N+1)(N+2)/2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that for each energy level, the number of states is (N + 2 choose 2), which is (N+2)(N+1)/2. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list the possible states in order of increasing energy. The ground state is when N=0, which is the state (n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0,0,0). That's energy E = (0+3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (3/2) \u0127\u03c9. The first excited state would be N=1. So what's the energy? (1 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (5/2) \u0127\u03c9. The next level is N=2, energy (2 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (7/2) \u0127\u03c9. Then N=3: (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. So the third excited state is when N=3? Or wait, let's count.\n\nGround state: N=0 \u2192 0th excited state? Or is ground state considered the zeroth excited state? No, the ground state is the lowest, so the first excited state is N=1, second is N=2, third is N=3. So the third excited state would have N=3, and energy (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = 9/2 \u0127\u03c9. So that part seems straightforward.\n\nSo the energy is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. Now, looking at the options, options A and C have this energy. Options B and D have different expressions, which don't look like the harmonic oscillator energy. So we can eliminate B and D. So the energy part is either A or C.\n\nNext, the number of eigenfunctions (linearly independent) for the same energy eigenvalue. That is, the degeneracy of the third excited state. For N=3, the degeneracy is the number of ways to write N=3 as the sum of three non-negative integers n_x, n_y, n_z.\n\nThe formula for the degeneracy (number of states) when N = n_x + n_y + n_z is (N + 2 choose 2). So for N=3, that's (3 +2)(3+1)/2? Wait, no, the formula is (N + 2 choose 2) = (N+2)(N+1)/2. Let me compute that. N=3, so (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5*4/2 = 10. So there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level. So the degeneracy is 10.\n\nLooking at the options, option A says 10, option C says 3. So the correct option should be A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to calculate the degeneracy is to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. The number of solutions is (3 +3 -1 choose 3 -1) )= (5 choose 2) = 10. Yeah, that matches.\n\nSo the energy is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9, and the degeneracy is 10. So the correct answer is option A.\n",

Alternatively, sometimes the energy is written in terms of a total quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then E = (N + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nBut what's the third excited state? Oh, wait, the ground state is the lowest energy. The first excited state is the next one, then second, third. So the third excited state would be the fourth state in terms of order (since counting starts from zero perhaps? Or maybe not. Wait, I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the ground state is the lowest energy state. The first excited state is the next one, so maybe the third excited state is the fourth state in terms of energy. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about how the energy levels are filled.\n\nIn a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate. The degeneracy depends on the value of N. For a given N, the number of states is (N+1)(N+2)/2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that for each energy level, the number of states is (N + 2 choose 2), which is (N+2)(N+1)/2. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list the possible states in order of increasing energy. The ground state is when N=0, which is the state (n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0,0,0). That's energy E = (0+3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (3/2) \u0127\u03c9. The first excited state would be N=1. So what's the energy? (1 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (5/2) \u0127\u03c9. The next level is N=2, energy (2 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (7/2) \u0127\u03c9. Then N=3: (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. So the third excited state is when N=3? Or wait, let's count.\n\nGround state: N=0 \u2192 0th excited state? Or is ground state considered the zeroth excited state? No, the ground state is the lowest, so the first excited state is N=1, second is N=2, third is N=3. So the third excited state would have N=3, and energy (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = 9/2 \u0127\u03c9. So that part seems straightforward.\n\nSo the energy is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. Now, looking at the options, options A and C have this energy. Options B and D have different expressions, which don't look like the harmonic oscillator energy. So we can eliminate B and D. So the energy part is either A or C.\n\nNext, the number of eigenfunctions (linearly independent) for the same energy eigenvalue. That is, the degeneracy of the third excited state. For N=3, the degeneracy is the number of ways to write N=3 as the sum of three non-negative integers n_x, n_y, n_z.\n\nThe formula for the degeneracy (number of states) when N = n_x + n_y + n_z is (N + 2 choose 2). So for N=3, that's (3 +2)(3+1)/2? Wait, no, the formula is (N + 2 choose 2) = (N+2)(N+1)/2. Let me compute that. N=3, so (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5*4/2 = 10. So there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level. So the degeneracy is 10.\n\nLooking at the options, option A says 10, option C says 3. So the correct option should be A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to calculate the degeneracy is to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. The number of solutions is (3 +3 -1 choose 3 -1) )= (5 choose 2) = 10. Yeah, that matches.\n\nSo the energy is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9, and the degeneracy is 10. So the correct answer is option A.\n\n\nThe problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels for such a system are given by $E = \\left(N + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\hbar \\omega$, where $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the total quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively. The degeneracy of a given energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy, which is given by the formula $\\text{Degeneracy} = \\frac{(N + 2)(N + 1)}{2}$.\n\nTo determine the energy of the third excited state, we note that the ground state corresponds to $N = 0$, the first excited state to $N = 1$, the second excited state to $N = 2$, and the third excited state to $N = 3$. Substituting $N = 3$ into the energy formula, the energy is:\n\n\\[\nE = \\left(3 + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega.\n\\]\n\nNext, the degeneracy of the third excited state (for $N = 3$) is calculated using the formula for degeneracy:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Degeneracy} = \\frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10.\n\\]\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue. Among the given options, only option A matches this result.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n- **Option A:** Correct, as it states the energy is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$ and the degeneracy is 10.\n- **Option B:** Incorrect, as it provides an energy expression inconsistent with the harmonic oscillator energy formula.\n- **Option C:** Incorrect, as it states the degeneracy is 3, which is incorrect for $N = 3$.\n- **Option D:** Incorrect, as it provides an energy expression inconsistent with the harmonic oscillator energy formula.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nAnswer: A",
