      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the question gives me a lot of data. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have different masses and radii. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times Earth's radius. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits, which is good because it simplifies things.\n\nThe problem mentions the transit and radial velocity methods. Wait, the transit method measures the dip in brightness as a planet passes in front of the star, which can give the planet's radius. The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's movement from the planet's gravitational pull, which relates to the planet's mass. So both methods have given us data about these planets.\n\nBut the question isn't about detection; it's about their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is the albedo.\n\nWait, but the problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so A cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures will depend on the square root of (R_star/(2a)) for each planet. So I need to find the ratio (T1_eq / T2_eq) = sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ) because the other terms (like R_star and T_star) would be the same for both and the (1-A) term is the same too.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the distances a1 and a2? Because the problem doesn't give me the orbital periods or the velocities. Oh, but it gives the RV shifts. The radial velocity method measures the star's wobble, which depends on the planet's mass and the distance of the planet from the star.\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) shift is given for each planet. Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. Planet2's shift is 0.04 \u00c5. RV shift (\u0394\u03bb) is related to the velocity (v) via \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where c is the speed of light. So the velocity is v = c*(\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb). \n\nWait, but the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity. The formula for K is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ) / ( ( (P/(2\u03c0)) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) ) ... Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )\n\nBut since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So K \u2248 ( (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) ) / ( c * P^(1/3) ) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) )\n\nBut I don't have the period P. However, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the distance a. Because the star's velocity is v = (2\u03c0 a) / P * sin i. But using Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G(M_star + M_p)) a\u00b3. Again, M_p << M_star, so P\u00b2 \u2248 (4\u03c0\u00b2/(G M_star)) a\u00b3.\n\nSubstituting P into the expression for v: v = (2\u03c0 a / P) sin i. So substituting P from above, P = sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star) ) ). So v = (2\u03c0 a) / sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star) ) ) * sin i.\n\nSimplify that: 2\u03c0 a / sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star) ) ) = 2\u03c0 a * sqrt( G M_star ) / sqrt(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )\n\nWait, sqrt(4\u03c0\u00b2 a^3) is 2\u03c0 a^(3/2). So:\n\nv = [2\u03c0 a * sqrt(G M_star)] / [2 \u03c0 a^(3/2)] ) ] * sin i = [ sqrt( G M_star ) / sqrt( a ) ) ] * sin i.\n\nSo v = sqrt( G M_star / a ) ) * sin i.\n\nBut K is the RV semi-amplitude, which is v. So K = sqrt( G M_star / a ) ) * sin i.\n\nAssuming sin i is the same for both planets (i.e., both orbits are edge-on, which is typical for transiting planets), then we can say K is proportional to sqrt(M_star / a). So K \u221d sqrt(M / a). Alternatively, rearranged, a \u221d M / K\u00b2.\n\nSo for each planet, a1 = (M1 / K1\u00b2) * (some constant), and a2 = (M2 / K2\u00b2) * same constant. So the ratio a2/a1 would be (M2 K1\u00b2) / (M1 K2\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute that. M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5. K1 is 0.03 \u00c5, K2 is 0.04 \u00c5. But wait, the RV shifts are given in terms of \u0394\u03bb. So I need to convert that to velocity.\n\nWait, but when using the ratio, the actual velocity values (i.e., the c factor) would cancel out because both are measured in the same units. Let me think again. Since K is proportional to (M_p) / sqrt(a), because from K = (v) = sqrt( G M_star / a ), so a = G M_star / v\u00b2. So for each planet, a = (G M_star) / (v_p)^2. So a1 = G M_star / (v1)^2, a2 = G M_star / (v2)^2. So the ratio a2/a1 = (v1^2)/(v2^2) ) * (M1)/(M2). Because a2/a1 = ( (G M_star)/(v2^2) ) / ( (G M_star)/(v1^2) ) ) * (M1/M2) ? Wait, no. Wait, wait, perhaps I should get a in terms of K.\n\nWait, K is the velocity semi-amplitude, which is the star's velocity. So for each planet, the star's velocity K is given by K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( (P/(2\u03c0) ) )^(-1/3) ) / (c * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to just consider the ratio between the two planets, since M_star is the same for both.\n\nLet me denote K1 as 0.03 \u00c5, K2 as 0.04 \u00c5. The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / (a^(1/2)) ), because from earlier, K = sqrt( G M_star / a ), so K is proportional to sqrt(M_star / a). Since M_star is same, K is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So a is proportional to 1/(K^2). So a1 = k / K1\u00b2, a2 = k / K2\u00b2, where k is a constant for both planets. So the ratio a2/a1 is (K1\u00b2 / K2\u00b2) * (M1 / M2), because a is proportional to (M_p) / K\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me think again. From the earlier relation, K = sqrt( G M_star / a ). So a = G M_star / K\u00b2. So a is proportional to (1/K\u00b2). So for two planets, a1 = (G M_star) / (K1)^2, a2 = (G M_star) / (K2)^2. So a2/a1 = (K1\u00b2 / K2\u00b2) * (M1 / M2) ? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, a1 is proportional to (M1 / K1\u00b2), but actually, M_p doesn't directly affect a because a is determined by the planet's orbital period and the star's mass.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The RV method gives K, which is the star's velocity. The star's velocity is related to the planet's mass and the distance. The formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * c ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )\n\nBut without knowing the period, perhaps another approach is needed. Alternatively, from Kepler's third law, the period squared is proportional to a^3 / M_star. So P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3)/(G M_star).\n\nSo combining this with the RV formula, perhaps we can find a relationship between K and a.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's express a in terms of K. Since K is the star's velocity, which is (2 pi a sin i) / P. But from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3)/(G M_star). So P = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star)) )^(1/2). \n\nSubstituting P into K equation:\n\nK = (2 pi a sin i) / P = (2 pi a sin i) / [ (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star)) )^(1/2) ) ]\n\nSimplify denominator: sqrt(4 pi\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star)) ) = (2 pi) a^(3/2) / (G M_star)^(1/2) )^0.5.\n\nWait, sqrt(4 pi\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star)) ) = sqrt(4 pi\u00b2) * sqrt(a^3) / sqrt(G M_star) ) = 2 pi a^(3/2) / sqrt(G M_star).\n\nSo K = (2 pi a sin i) / [ 2 pi a^(3/2) / sqrt(G M_star) ) ] = [ 2 pi a sin i * sqrt(G M_star) ) ] / [ 2 pi a^(3/2) ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 2 pi cancels. a / a^(3/2) = a^(-1/2). So:\n\nK = [ a sin i * sqrt(G M_star) ) ] / a^(3/2) ) = [ sin i * sqrt(G M_star) ) ] / a^(1/2) )\n\nWhich is K = sin i * sqrt( G M_star / a )\n\nSo rearranging, a = ( G M_star ) / ( (K / sin i )^2 )\n\nAssuming sin i is the same for both planets (since both transit, which requires sin i \u2248 1), then a is inversely proportional to K\u00b2. So a1 = (G M_star) / (K1\u00b2), a2 = (G M_star) / (K2\u00b2). So a2/a1 = ( K1\u00b2 ) / ( K2\u00b2 ) * ( M1 / M2 )? Wait, no, because M_p doesn't directly affect a from this equation. Wait, but wait, in the equation for K, M_p is in the numerator. Because earlier, K is proportional to M_p. Wait, no, from the equation I derived, K is proportional to sqrt( M_p )? Wait, no, let me re-examine.\n\nWait, no. The equation I derived is K = sin i * sqrt( G M_star / a ). So M_p doesn't directly appear in this equation. Hmm, but that can't be right because the mass of the planet should affect K. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because the K formula should involve the planet's mass. Let me check.\n\nWait, the correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e\u00b2)) ) * ( (2 pi / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c )\n\nBut since e is zero (circular orbits), and M_p << M_star, this simplifies. So K \u2248 ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) * ( (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) ) / c \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3) / (G M_star), so P = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star)) )^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting P into K:\n\nK = [ (G M_p ) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ] * [ (2 pi ) / ( (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star))^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) / c \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to simplify.\n\nLet me express (2 pi / P )^(1/3) as [ (2 pi ) / ( (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star))^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3)\n\nWhich is [ (2 pi ) * (G M_star)^(1/2) ) / (4 pi\u00b2 a^3 )^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify the denominator inside: (4 pi\u00b2 a^3)^(1/2) = 2 pi a^(3/2)\n\nSo the expression becomes [ (2 pi ) * sqrt(G M_star) ) / (2 pi a^(3/2) ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 2 pi cancels. So [ sqrt(G M_star) / a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nWhich is [ (G M_star )^(1/2) / a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 ) = (G M_star )^(1/6) / a^(1/2 )\n\nSo putting it all together, K \u2248 ( G M_p ) / M_star^(2/3) ) * ( (G M_star )^(1/6) ) / ( a^(1/2) ) ) / c \n\nSimplify terms:\n\nG^(1) * M_p * M_star^( -2/3 ) * G^(1/6) * M_star^(1/6) ) / ( a^(1/2) c )\n\nCombine exponents:\n\nG^(1 + 1/6) = G^(7/6)\nM_p remains as is.\nM_star: (-2/3 + 1/6) = (-4/6 + 1/6) = (-3/6) = -1/2. So M_star^(-1/2)\na^(-1/2)\nc in denominator.\n\nSo K \u2248 ( G^(7/6) M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) c ) )\n\nBut this seems messy. Perhaps another approach: since both planets orbit the same star, M_star is the same for both. So for each planet, K \u221d sqrt( M_p ) / a^(1/2 )\n\nSo K = constant * sqrt( M_p ) / sqrt(a )\n\nWhich can be rearranged to a = (constant^2 * M_p ) / (K^2 )\n\nBut since the constant is the same for both planets, the ratio a2/a1 = ( M2 K1\u00b2 ) / ( M1 K2\u00b2 )\n\nBecause a1 = (cst^2 M1 ) / K1\u00b2, a2 = (cst^2 M2 ) / K2\u00b2. So a2/a1 = ( M2 / M1 ) * ( K1\u00b2 / K2\u00b2 )\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because K is proportional to sqrt(M_p)/sqrt(a), so a is proportional to M_p / K\u00b2. So the ratio a2/a1 = ( M2 K1\u00b2 ) / ( M1 K2\u00b2 )\n\nNow, let's plug in the numbers.\n\nM1 = 7 Earth masses, M2 = 5 Earth masses.\n\nK1 = 0.03 \u00c5, K2 = 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nSo a2/a1 = (5 * (0.03)^2 ) / (7 * (0.04)^2 )\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute (0.03)^2 = 0.0009, (0.04)^2=0.0016.\n\nSo numerator: 5 * 0.0009 = 0.0045\n\nDenominator:7 * 0.0016 = 0.0112\n\nSo a2/a1 = 0.0045 / 0.0112 \u2248 0.4018.\n\nSo approximately 0.402.\n\nNow, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ) because T_eq \u221d sqrt( (R_star) / (a) )\n\nWait, no, let's get the equilibrium temperature formula correct.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nSince A is the same for both planets, the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2/(a1) ) multiplied by sqrt( R_star / (2a2) ) divided by sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) ), but wait, R_star is the same for both, so it cancels out.\n\nWait, more accurately, T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(a) ). Because the other factors (T_star and (1-A) ) are same for both.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, no, because T_eq is proportional to T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * (1-A)^(1/4). So since R_star and T_star and (1-A) are same for both, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause T_eq \u221d 1/sqrt(a), so T1 = (1/sqrt(a1)) * const, T2 = (1/sqrt(a2)) * const.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )\n\nWe found a2/a1 \u2248 0.4018.\n\nSo sqrt(0.4018) \u2248 0.634.\n\nSo T1/T2 \u2248 0.634. So T1 is cooler than T2.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So it's T1/T2 \u2248 0.634.\n\nLooking at the options: option C is ~0.53, which is lower than 0.634. Option A is ~0.98, which is close to 1. Option D is ~1.05, which is just over 1. Option B is ~1.30. Hmm, none of these exactly match 0.634. Did I make a mistake in my calculation?\n\nWait, let's double-check the a2/a1 calculation.\n\na2/a1 = (M2 * K1\u00b2) / (M1 * K2\u00b2 )\n\nM2=5, M1=7.\n\nK1=0.03, K2=0.04.\n\nSo:\n\n(5 * (0.03)^2 ) / (7 * (0.04)^2 )\n\n= (5 * 0.0009) / (7 * 0.0016 )\n\n= (0.0045) / (0.0112 )\n\n\u2248 0.4018.\n\nSo sqrt(0.4018) \u2248 0.634.\n\nSo T1/T2 is about 0.634. So the ratio is approximately 0.63, which is not exactly any of the options. The options are A: ~0.98, B: ~1.30, C: ~0.53, D: ~1.05.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for a ratio. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\n\nSo T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), because a is in the denominator under the square root.\n\nSo T_eq \u221d 1/sqrt(a). So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) )\n\nWait, no. Because T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a1), T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )\n\nBecause T1 = k / sqrt(a1), T2 = k / sqrt(a2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )\n\nSo with a2/a1 \u2248 0.4018, T1/T2 \u2248 sqrt(0.4018) \u2248 0.634.\n\nBut none of the options are near 0.63. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong in the K ratio approach.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the velocities correctly, considering the Doppler shift.\n\nWait, the RV shift is given as a wavelength shift, so I can calculate the velocity for each planet.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c.\n\nSo v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda )\n\nThe [OI] line is at 6300 \u00c5. So for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03 \u00c5. So v1 = (3e5 km/s) * (0.03 / 6300 )\n\nWait, no, because 1e5 km/s is the speed of light. Wait, c is approximately 3e5 km/s.\n\nSo delta_lambda / lambda = 0.03 / 6300 = 0.0000047619.\n\nSo v1 = 3e5 km/s * 0.0000047619 \u2248 1.42857 km/s.\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2, delta_lambda = 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nv2 = 3e5 km/s * (0.04 /6300) \u2248 3e5 * 0.000006349 \u2248 1.90476 km/s.\n\nSo K1 \u2248 1.4286 km/s, K2 \u22481.9048 km/s.\n\nNow, using the formula for RV semi-amplitude K:\n\nK = ( (G * (M_p) )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c.\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to K \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) / c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for K in terms of a and M_p.\n\nFrom another source, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / sqrt(1 - e\u00b2) ) ) * ( (2 pi / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c \n\nBut since e=0, and M_p << M_star, it simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3 )/( G M_star )\n\nSo P = sqrt( (4 pi\u00b2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )\n\nSo (2 pi / P ) = (2 pi ) / sqrt( (4 pi\u00b2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ) )\n\n= (2 pi ) * sqrt( G M_star ) ) / (2 pi a^(3/2) ) )\n\n= sqrt( G M_star ) / a^(3/2 )\n\nSo (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) = ( G M_star )^(1/6) / a^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting back into K:\n\nK \u2248 ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ) / a^(1/2 ) ) / c \n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nG^(1/3 + 1/6) = G^(1/2)\nM_p^(1/3)\nM_star^( -2/3 +1/6 ) = M_star^(-1/2 )\na^(-1/2)\nc in denominator.\n\nSo K \u2248 ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) c ) )\n\nBut since G and c are constants for both planets, and M_star is same, K is proportional to (M_p^(1/3)) / ( a^(1/2) )\n\nSo K = C * (M_p^(1/3)) / sqrt(a )\n\nRearranging, a = ( C\u00b2 * M_p^(2/3) ) / K\u00b2 \n\nSo for each planet, a is proportional to M_p^(2/3) / K\u00b2.\n\nSo the ratio a2/a1 = ( M2^(2/3) / K2\u00b2 ) / ( M1^(2/3) / K1\u00b2 ) ) = ( M2^(2/3) K1\u00b2 ) / ( M1^(2/3) K2\u00b2 )\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nM1 =7, M2=5.\n\nK1=1.4286 km/s, K2=1.9048 km/s.\n\nCompute each part:\n\nM2^(2/3) =5^(2/3) \u2248 (5^(1/3))^2 \u2248 (1.7099759)^2 \u2248 2.924.\n\nM1^(2/3) =7^(2/3) \u2248 (1.913)^2 \u2248 3.659.\n\nK1^2 = (1.4286)^2 \u2248 2.041.\n\nK2^2 = (1.9048)^2 \u2248 3.628.\n\nSo a2/a1 = (2.924 * 2.041) / (3.659 * 3.628 )\n\nCompute numerator: 2.924 * 2.041 \u2248 5.965.\n\nDenominator: 3.659 *3.628 \u2248 13.28.\n\nSo a2/a1 \u2248 5.965 /13.28 \u2248 0.449.\n\nSo a2/a1 \u2248 0.449.\n\nThen, T_eq ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) \u2248 sqrt(0.449) \u2248 0.67.\n\nStill around 0.67. But the options don't have that. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps I should not have used the velocities calculated from the Doppler shift but instead used the given K values directly. Because the problem stated the shifts in forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, which we converted to velocities. But perhaps the forbidden line's wavelength doesn't matter because we're taking the ratio of K1 and K2, and the same wavelength is used for both, so the ratio K1/K2 would be the same as v1/v2.\n\nWait, in the previous approach, when I used K1=0.03 and K2=0.04 in terms of the shift, perhaps I should have converted them to velocities first.\n\nWait, let's recompute using the velocities.\n\nK1 = 0.03 \u00c5 shift. So v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c.\n\nc is 3e5 km/s, so v1 = (0.03 /6300) *3e5 = (0.03 *3e5 ) /6300 = (9e3) /6300 \u2248 1.4286 km/s.\n\nSimilarly, K2 =0.04 \u00c5, so v2 = (0.04/6300)*3e5 = (0.04 *3e5 ) /6300 = (1.2e4)/6300 \u2248 1.9048 km/s.\n\nSo the earlier calculation is correct.\n\nBut according to the formula, a2/a1 = ( M2^(2/3) K1\u00b2 ) / ( M1^(2/3) K2\u00b2 )\n\nSo plugging in:\n\nM2^(2/3)=5^(2/3)\u22482.924, M1^(2/3)=7^(2/3)\u22483.659\n\nK1^2 = (1.4286)^2\u22482.041, K2^2\u22483.628.\n\nSo:\n\na2/a1 \u2248 (2.924 * 2.041 ) / (3.659 * 3.628 ) \u2248 (5.965 ) / (13.28 )\u22480.449.\n\nThus, a2/a1\u22480.449. So T1/T2 = sqrt(0.449 )\u22480.67.\n\nHmm, but the options are A) ~0.98, B) ~1.30, C) ~0.53, D) ~1.05.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the formula for a.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's calculate a1 and a2 using the RV data.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star )\n\nSo P = (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting into K:\n\nK = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi ) / (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) ) )^(1/3) ) / c \n\nSimplify the denominator inside the cube root:\n\n(4 pi\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) = (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) (a^3 )^(1/2 ) ( G M_star )^(-1/2 )\n\n= 2 pi a^(3/2) ( G M_star )^(-1/2 )\n\nSo (2 pi ) / [ 2 pi a^(3/2) ( G M_star )^(-1/2 ) ) ] = [ (2 pi ) * ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) ) ] / ( 2 pi a^(3/2 ) )\n\n= ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) ) / a^(3/2 )\n\nSo (2 pi / P )^(1/3 ) = [ ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) / a^(3/2 ) ) ]^(1/3 ) \n\n= ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) / a^(1/2 )\n\nPutting it back into K:\n\nK = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) / a^(1/2 ) ) / c \n\nSimplify exponents:\n\nG: (1/3 + 1/6 ) = (2/6 +1/6 )=1/2 \u2192 G^(1/2 )\nM_p: 1/3 \u2192 M_p^(1/3)\nM_star: ( -2/3 +1/6 )= (-4/6 +1/6 )= -3/6 = -1/2 \u2192 M_star^(-1/2)\na: -1/2 \u2192 a^(-1/2)\nc in denominator.\n\nSo K = ( G^(1/2 ) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/2 ) a^(1/2) c )\n\nBut since G and c are constants, and M_star is same for both, K is proportional to ( M_p^(1/3) ) / sqrt(a )\n\nSo K = C * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / sqrt(a )\n\nRearranged, a = C\u00b2 * M_p^(2/3) / K\u00b2 \n\nSo for each planet, a1 = C\u00b2 * M1^(2/3) / K1\u00b2\n\na2 = C\u00b2 * M2^(2/3) / K2\u00b2 \n\nSo a2/a1 = [ M2^(2/3) / K2\u00b2 ] / [ M1^(2/3) / K1\u00b2 ] \n\n= [ M2^(2/3) K1\u00b2 ] / [ M1^(2/3) K2\u00b2 ]\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nM1=7, M2=5.\n\nK1=1.4286, K2=1.9048.\n\nCompute M2^(2/3) =5^(2/3)= (5^1/3)^2\u22481.70997^2\u22482.924.\n\nM1^(2/3)=7^(2/3)= (7^1/3)^2\u22481.913^2\u22483.659.\n\nK1\u00b2= (1.4286)^2\u22482.041.\n\nK2\u00b2= (1.9048)^2\u22483.628.\n\nSo numerator: 2.924 *2.041\u22485.965.\n\nDenominator:3.659 *3.628\u224813.28.\n\na2/a1\u22485.965/13.28\u22480.449.\n\nThus, a2/a1\u22480.449.\n\nSo T_eq ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) \u2248 sqrt(0.449)\u22480.67.\n\nBut again, the options don't have 0.67.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it using the actual formula for equilibrium temperature.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nSince A is the same, the ratio is:\n\nT1/T2 = sqrt( a2/(a1) ) * sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a1) )\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because R_star is the same for both, it cancels out.\n\nWait, let's compute T1/T2 correctly.\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * (1 - A )^(1/4 )\n\nSo T1 = T_star * sqrt( R/(2a1) ) * (1 - A )^(1/4 )\n\nT2 = T_star * sqrt( R/(2a2) ) * (1 - A )^(1/4 )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause R/(2a1) divided by R/(2a2) is (a2/a1).\n\nSo yes, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo with a2/a1\u22480.449, T1/T2\u22480.67.\n\nBut the options don't have this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the approach. Maybe the RV shifts given are not the full semi-amplitude but just the maximum shift. Or perhaps I should have used the actual velocity amplitude correctly.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should use the inverse relation. Because the planet with the larger RV shift (K) is more massive or closer. Wait, no. For a more massive planet, K should be larger, but if it's closer, K would also be larger because a is smaller (since K is inversely proportional to sqrt(a)).\n\nBut in our case, K2 is larger than K1. So Planet2 has a larger RV shift, meaning either it's more massive, or closer, or both.\n\nIn our case, Planet1 has M1=7, Planet2 M2=5. So Planet1 is more massive but has a smaller K. So that suggests that Planet1 is farther away than Planet2.\n\nBecause K is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so larger K means smaller a.\n\nSo Planet2 has a larger K (0.04) than Planet1 (0.03), so Planet2 is closer.\n\nSo a2 < a1.\n\nThus, T_eq is higher for Planet2 because it's closer to the star.\n\nWhich matches our previous conclusion that T1/T2\u22480.67, so T1 is cooler than T2.\n\nBut none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the RV shift isn't directly K but the maximum shift. Or perhaps the problem states the shift is in the forbidden line, which might have a different scaling.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5.\"\n\nSo the shifts are given as 0.03 and 0.04 \u00c5, respectively, in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5.\n\nWait, but the Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v/c.\n\nSo the maximum velocity is v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda )\n\nSo for Planet1: v1 = (3e5 km/s) * (0.03 / 6300 ) \u2248 1.4286 km/s.\n\nPlanet2: v2= (3e5 km/s) * (0.04 /6300 ) \u22481.9048 km/s.\n\nSo K1=1.4286 km/s, K2=1.9048 km/s.\n\nNow, using the formula for K:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3) ) / c \n\nAssuming M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK = ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3) ) / c \n\nFrom Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star )\n\nSo P = (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nSo (2 pi / P ) = (2 pi ) / ( (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) )\n\n= (2 pi ) / ( 2 pi a^(3/2 ) / sqrt( G M_star ) )\n\n= sqrt( G M_star ) / a^(3/2 )\n\nSo (2 pi / P )^(1/3 ) = ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) / a^(1/2 )\n\nPutting it back into K:\n\nK = ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ) / a^(1/2 ) ) / c \n\nSimplify exponents:\n\nG: (1/3 + 1/6 ) = 1/2 \u2192 G^(1/2 )\n\nM_p: 1/3 \u2192 M_p^(1/3 )\n\nM_star: (-2/3 + 1/6 ) = (-1/2 )\n\na: -1/2 \n\nc in denominator.\n\nSo K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) c )\n\nThus, K is proportional to ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( a^(1/2) )\n\nSo a = ( M_p^(2/3) ) / ( K^2 ) * ( G / c^2 ) * ( M_star )\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to express a in terms of K and M_p.\n\nFrom K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) c )\n\nRearranging:\n\na^(1/2 ) = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/2) c K )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\na = [ G M_p^(2/3) ] / ( M_star c^2 K^2 )\n\nSo a = ( G M_p^(2/3) ) / ( M_star c\u00b2 K\u00b2 )\n\nBut since G and c are constants, and M_star is same for both planets, a is proportional to M_p^(2/3) / K\u00b2.\n\nThus, a1 \u221d (7)^(2/3) / (K1)^2, a2 \u221d (5)^(2/3) / (K2)^2.\n\nSo a2/a1 = (5^(2/3)/K2\u00b2) / (7^(2/3)/K1\u00b2) ) = (5^(2/3) K1\u00b2 ) / (7^(2/3) K2\u00b2 )\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n\n5^(2/3)= ~2.924, 7^(2/3)= ~3.659.\n\nK1=1.4286, K2=1.9048.\n\nK1\u00b2=2.041, K2\u00b2=3.628.\n\nSo:\n\na2/a1= (2.924 * 2.041 ) / (3.659 *3.628 ) \n\n= (5.965 ) / (13.28 ) \u2248 0.449.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nThus, T1/T2= sqrt(0.449)= ~0.67.\n\nBut the options don't have this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the actual a1 and a2 using the formula a = ( G M_p^(2/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/2) c\u00b2 K\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but I don't have the actual values for G and c, but perhaps I can compute the ratio without them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express the ratio using the velocity formula.\n\nBecause I have K1 and K2, and M1 and M2.\n\nWait, from the formula K = (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(1/2) )\n\nWait, perhaps I should rearrange this to find a.\n\nWait, K = (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(1/2) )\n\nMultiply both sides by a^(1/2):\n\nK a^(1/2) = (G M_p )^(1/3) / M_star^(2/3 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nK\u00b2 a = (G M_p )^(2/3) / M_star^(4/3 )\n\nSo a = (G M_p )^(2/3) / ( M_star^(4/3) K\u00b2 )\n\nBut G and M_star are same for both, so a is proportional to M_p^(2/3) / K\u00b2.\n\nWhich brings us back to the same ratio.\n\nSo a2/a1= (5^(2/3) K1\u00b2 ) / (7^(2/3) K2\u00b2 )\n\nSo same as before.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is not about the ratio of T_eq, but the inverse.\n\nWait, no. The problem asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which is T1/T2.\n\nBut according to our calculation, it's ~0.67, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I confused the ratio a2/a1 with a1/a2.\n\nBecause the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ), but perhaps I should have taken a1/a2.\n\nWait, let me think again. T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if a2 < a1, then T2 > T1.\n\nSo T1/T2 is less than 1.\n\nSo if a2/a1 is 0.449, then sqrt(0.449) is about 0.67.\n\nBut perhaps the problem uses the inverse ratio.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for T2/T1 instead of T1/T2. Because looking at the options, option B is ~1.3, which is approximately 1/0.77. So 1.3 is approximately 1/0.77, which is about 1.3.\n\nWait, but the question clearly says \"the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2\", which is T1/T2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and it should be T_eq proportional to sqrt( a ), which would invert the ratio.\n\nWait, no.

Let's think of the ratio.\n\nSince the problem gives us the RV shifts (K) for both planets, and their masses, and we need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.\n\nWe have to find T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nWe have a2/a1 = (M2^(2/3) K1\u00b2 ) / ( M1^(2/3) K2\u00b2 )\n\nPlugging in the numbers again:\n\nM2=5, M1=7.\n\nK1=1.4286, K2=1.9048.\n\nSo M2^(2/3)=5^(2/3)=~2.924.\n\nM1^(2/3)=7^(2/3)=~3.659.\n\nK1\u00b2=2.041, K2\u00b2=3.628.\n\nSo a2/a1= (2.924 *2.041)/(3.659 *3.628 )=5.965 /13.28\u22480.449.\n\nSo T1/T2=sqrt(0.449 )=0.67.\n\nBut the options don't have this.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that the RV shift is given in wavelength, and I should have used the inverse of the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for a is a = (G M_star )/(K^2 ), but I think that's only when K is the velocity due to the star's movement, and other factors are considered.\n\nWait, let's think about the formula a = (G M_star )/(K^2 )\n\nWait, no, because K is v = (G M_p )/(a )^(1/2 ), but this is only when M_p << M_star.\n\nWait, perhaps a = (G M_p )/(K^2 )\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have used a = ( (G M_star )^(1/2) ) / ( K )\n\nWait, no, because K = sqrt( G M_star / a ), so a = G M_star / K\u00b2.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because K is in velocity units (km/s), and G has units of m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the formula a = (G M_star )/(K^2 ), but units-wise, that may not work.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a = ( (G M_star ) ) / ( v^2 )\n\nBut v is in m/s, G is m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.\n\nSo a would have units m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * s^2 m^-2 = m.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo let's compute a in meters.\n\nBut that's a lot of computation, but let's try.\n\nG = 6.67430e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.\n\nM_star = 1.5 * M_sun.

Wait, no.\n\nWait, the correct formula for RV semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = (v ) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2 pi ) / (P ) )^(1/3) ) / c \n\nBut when M_p << M_star, this simplifies to K \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / (M_star ) )^(1/3 ) * ( 2 pi / P )^(1/3 ) ) / c \n\nFrom Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3 )/( G M_star )\n\nSo P = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting into K:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi ) / ( (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) ) )^(1/3 ) ) / c \n\nSimplify the denominator inside the cube root:\n\n(4 pi\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) = (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) * (a^3 )^(1/2 ) * ( G M_star )^(-1/2 )\n\n= 2 pi a^(3/2) ( G M_star )^(-1/2 )\n\nSo (2 pi ) / denominator = (2 pi ) / (2 pi a^(3/2 ) ( G M_star )^(-1/2 ) ) )\n\n= (2 pi ) * ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) ) / (2 pi a^(3/2 ) )\n\n= ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) / a^(3/2 )\n\nSo (2 pi / P )^(1/3 )= [ ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) / a^(3/2 ) ]^(1/3 ) \n\n= ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) / a^(1/2 )\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nK \u2248 ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) / M_star^(1/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ) / a^(1/2 ) ) / c \n\nSimplify exponents:\n\nG: (1/3 +1/6 )= 1/2 \u2192 G^(1/2 )\n\nM_p: 1/3 \u2192 M_p^(1/3 )\n\nM_star: (-1/3 +1/6 )= (-1/6 )\n\na: -1/2 \n\nc in denominator.\n\nSo K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/6) a^(1/2) c )\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nK = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( ( M_star^(1/3) )^(1/2) a^(1/2) c )\n\n= ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( ( M_star^(1/2) a )^(1/2) c )\n\n= ( G M_p^(2/3) )^(1/2) / ( M_star^(1/2) a )^(1/2) c )\n\n= sqrt( G M_p^(2/3) ) / ( sqrt( M_star a ) c )\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to express a in terms of K and M_p.\n\nRearranging:\n\na = [ ( G M_p^(2/3) ) / ( K c^2 M_star^(1/2) ) ) ]^(something )\n\nAlternatively, let's square both sides of K equation:\n\nK^2 = ( G M_p^(2/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/3) a ) ) / c\u00b2 \n\nSo K^2 = ( G M_p^(2/3) ) / ( c\u00b2 M_star^(1/3) a )\n\nRearranged:\n\na = ( G M_p^(2/3) ) / ( c\u00b2 M_star^(1/3) K^2 )\n\nThus, a is proportional to M_p^(2/3) / K\u00b2.\n\nWhich brings us back to the earlier approach.\n\nSo the correct ratio is a2/a1= (M2^(2/3) K1\u00b2 ) / ( M1^(2/3) K2\u00b2 )\n\nWhich gives 0.449.\n\nSo T1/T2= sqrt(0.449 )=0.67.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the RV semi-amplitude formula to be K = (v ) = ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star ) )^(1/3 ) * ( 1 / sqrt(a) )\n\nWhich would make K proportional to M_p^(1/3) / sqrt(a )\n\nSo a proportional to M_p^(2/3) / K\u00b2.\n\nWhich again leads to the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the planet masses and assume a is proportional to (M_p K )^{-1}.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula a = ( (G M_star )/( K^2 ) )\n\nWhich would give a = (6.67e-11 * 1.5 *2e30 kg )/( (v )^2 )\n\nBut earlier calculation with that gave a2/a1=0.5625, T1/T2=0.75.\n\nBut the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses the Doppler shift without considering the star's mass correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures using the inverse square root of the distance ratio.\n\nBut I'm stuck.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the question gives me a lot of data. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have different masses and radii. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times Earth's radius. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits, which is good because it simplifies things.\n\nThe problem mentions the transit and radial velocity methods. Wait, the transit method measures the dip in brightness as a planet passes in front of the star, which can give the planet's radius. The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's movement from the planet's gravitational pull, which relates to the planet's mass. So both methods have given us data about these planets.\n\nBut the question isn't about detection; it's about their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is the albedo.\n\nWait, but the problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so A cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures will depend on the square root of (R_star/(2a)) for each planet. So I need to find the ratio (T1_eq / T2_eq) = sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ) because the other terms (like R_star and T_star) would be the same for both and the (1-A) term is the same too.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the distances a1 and a2? Because the problem doesn't give me the orbital periods or the velocities. Oh, but it gives the RV shifts. The radial velocity method measures the star's wobble, which depends on the planet's mass and the distance of the planet from the star.\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) shift is given for each planet. Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. Planet2's shift is 0.04 \u00c5. RV shift (\u0394\u03bb) is related to the velocity (v) via \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where c is the speed of light. So the velocity is v = c*(\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb). \n\nWait, but the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity. The formula for K is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ) / ( ( (P/(2\u03c0)) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) ) ... Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )\n\nBut since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So K \u2248 ( (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) ) / ( c * P^(1/3) ) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) )\n\nBut I don't have the period P. However, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the distance a. Because the star's velocity is v = (2\u03c0 a) / P * sin i. But using Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G(M_star + M_p)) a\u00b3. Again, M_p << M_star, so P\u00b2 \u2248 (4\u03c0\u00b2/(G M_star)) a\u00b3.\n\nSubstituting P into the expression for v: v = (2\u03c0 a / P) sin i. So substituting P from above, P = sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star) ) ). So v = (2\u03c0 a) / sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star) ) ) * sin i.\n\nSimplify that: 2\u03c0 a / sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star) ) ) = 2\u03c0 a * sqrt( G M_star ) / sqrt(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )\n\nWait, sqrt(4\u03c0\u00b2 a^3) is 2\u03c0 a^(3/2). So:\n\nv = [2\u03c0 a * sqrt(G M_star)] / [2 \u03c0 a^(3/2)] ) ] * sin i = [ sqrt( G M_star ) / sqrt( a ) ) ] * sin i.\n\nSo v = sqrt( G M_star / a ) ) * sin i.\n\nBut K is the RV semi-amplitude, which is v. So K = sqrt( G M_star / a ) ) * sin i.\n\nAssuming sin i is the same for both planets (i.e., both orbits are edge-on, which is typical for transiting planets), then we can say K is proportional to sqrt(M_star / a). So K \u221d sqrt(M / a). Alternatively, rearranged, a \u221d M / K\u00b2.\n\nSo for each planet, a1 = (M1 / K1\u00b2) * (some constant), and a2 = (M2 / K2\u00b2) * same constant. So the ratio a2/a1 would be (M2 K1\u00b2) / (M1 K2\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute that. M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5. K1 is 0.03 \u00c5, K2 is 0.04 \u00c5. But wait, the RV shifts are given in terms of \u0394\u03bb. So I need to convert that to velocity.\n\nWait, but when using the ratio, the actual velocity values (i.e., the c factor) would cancel out because both are measured in the same units. Let me think again. Since K is proportional to (M_p) / sqrt(a), because from K = (v) = sqrt( G M_star / a ), so a = G M_star / v\u00b2. So for each planet, a = (G M_star) / (v_p)^2. So a1 = G M_star / (v1)^2, a2 = G M_star / (v2)^2. So the ratio a2/a1 = (v1^2)/(v2^2) ) * (M1)/(M2). Because a2/a1 = ( (G M_star)/(v2^2) ) / ( (G M_star)/(v1^2) ) ) * (M1/M2) ? Wait, no. Wait, wait, perhaps I should get a in terms of K.\n\nWait, K is the velocity semi-amplitude, which is the star's velocity. So for each planet, the star's velocity K is given by K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( (P/(2\u03c0) ) )^(-1/3) ) / (c * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to just consider the ratio between the two planets, since M_star is the same for both.\n\nLet me denote K1 as 0.03 \u00c5, K2 as 0.04 \u00c5. The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / (a^(1/2)) ), because from earlier, K = sqrt( G M_star / a ), so K is proportional to sqrt(M_star / a). Since M_star is same, K is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So a is proportional to 1/(K^2). So a1 = k / K1\u00b2, a2 = k / K2\u00b2, where k is a constant for both planets. So the ratio a2/a1 is (K1\u00b2 / K2\u00b2) * (M1 / M2), because a is proportional to (M_p) / K\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me think again. From the earlier relation, K = sqrt( G M_star / a ). So a = G M_star / K\u00b2. So a is proportional to (1/K\u00b2). So for two planets, a1 = (G M_star) / (K1)^2, a2 = (G M_star) / (K2)^2. So a2/a1 = (K1\u00b2 / K2\u00b2) * (M1 / M2) ? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, a1 is proportional to (M1 / K1\u00b2), but actually, M_p doesn't directly affect a because a is determined by the planet's orbital period and the star's mass.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The RV method gives K, which is the star's velocity. The star's velocity is related to the planet's mass and the distance. The formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * c ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )\n\nBut without knowing the period, perhaps another approach is needed. Alternatively, from Kepler's third law, the period squared is proportional to a^3 / M_star. So P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3)/(G M_star).\n\nSo combining this with the RV formula, perhaps we can find a relationship between K and a.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's express a in terms of K. Since K is the star's velocity, which is (2 pi a sin i) / P. But from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3)/(G M_star). So P = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star)) )^(1/2). \n\nSubstituting P into K equation:\n\nK = (2 pi a sin i) / P = (2 pi a sin i) / [ (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star)) )^(1/2) ) ]\n\nSimplify denominator: sqrt(4 pi\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star)) ) = (2 pi) a^(3/2) / (G M_star)^(1/2) )^0.5.\n\nWait, sqrt(4 pi\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star)) ) = sqrt(4 pi\u00b2) * sqrt(a^3) / sqrt(G M_star) ) = 2 pi a^(3/2) / sqrt(G M_star).\n\nSo K = (2 pi a sin i) / [ 2 pi a^(3/2) / sqrt(G M_star) ) ] = [ 2 pi a sin i * sqrt(G M_star) ) ] / [ 2 pi a^(3/2) ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 2 pi cancels. a / a^(3/2) = a^(-1/2). So:\n\nK = [ a sin i * sqrt(G M_star) ) ] / a^(3/2) ) = [ sin i * sqrt(G M_star) ) ] / a^(1/2) )\n\nWhich is K = sin i * sqrt( G M_star / a )\n\nSo rearranging, a = ( G M_star ) / ( (K / sin i )^2 )\n\nAssuming sin i is the same for both planets (since both transit, which requires sin i \u2248 1), then a is inversely proportional to K\u00b2. So a1 = (G M_star) / (K1\u00b2), a2 = (G M_star) / (K2\u00b2). So a2/a1 = ( K1\u00b2 ) / ( K2\u00b2 ) * ( M1 / M2 )? Wait, no, because M_p doesn't directly affect a from this equation. Wait, but wait, in the equation for K, M_p is in the numerator. Because earlier, K is proportional to M_p. Wait, no, from the equation I derived, K is proportional to sqrt( M_p )? Wait, no, let me re-examine.\n\nWait, no. The equation I derived is K = sin i * sqrt( G M_star / a ). So M_p doesn't directly appear in this equation. Hmm, but that can't be right because the mass of the planet should affect K. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because the K formula should involve the planet's mass. Let me check.\n\nWait, the correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e\u00b2)) ) * ( (2 pi / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c )\n\nBut since e is zero (circular orbits), and M_p << M_star, this simplifies. So K \u2248 ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) * ( (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) ) / c \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3) / (G M_star), so P = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star)) )^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting P into K:\n\nK = [ (G M_p ) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ] * [ (2 pi ) / ( (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star))^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) / c \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to simplify.\n\nLet me express (2 pi / P )^(1/3) as [ (2 pi ) / ( (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star))^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3)\n\nWhich is [ (2 pi ) * (G M_star)^(1/2) ) / (4 pi\u00b2 a^3 )^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify the denominator inside: (4 pi\u00b2 a^3)^(1/2) = 2 pi a^(3/2)\n\nSo the expression becomes [ (2 pi ) * sqrt(G M_star) ) / (2 pi a^(3/2) ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 2 pi cancels. So [ sqrt(G M_star) / a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nWhich is [ (G M_star )^(1/2) / a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 ) = (G M_star )^(1/6) / a^(1/2 )\n\nSo putting it all together, K \u2248 ( G M_p ) / M_star^(2/3) ) * ( (G M_star )^(1/6) ) / ( a^(1/2) ) ) / c \n\nSimplify terms:\n\nG^(1) * M_p * M_star^( -2/3 ) * G^(1/6) * M_star^(1/6) ) / ( a^(1/2) c )\n\nCombine exponents:\n\nG^(1 + 1/6) = G^(7/6)\nM_p remains as is.\nM_star: (-2/3 + 1/6) = (-4/6 + 1/6) = (-3/6) = -1/2. So M_star^(-1/2)\na^(-1/2)\nc in denominator.\n\nSo K \u2248 ( G^(7/6) M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) c ) )\n\nBut this seems messy. Perhaps another approach: since both planets orbit the same star, M_star is the same for both. So for each planet, K \u221d sqrt( M_p ) / a^(1/2 )\n\nSo K = constant * sqrt( M_p ) / sqrt(a )\n\nWhich can be rearranged to a = (constant^2 * M_p ) / (K^2 )\n\nBut since the constant is the same for both planets, the ratio a2/a1 = ( M2 K1\u00b2 ) / ( M1 K2\u00b2 )\n\nBecause a1 = (cst^2 M1 ) / K1\u00b2, a2 = (cst^2 M2 ) / K2\u00b2. So a2/a1 = ( M2 / M1 ) * ( K1\u00b2 / K2\u00b2 )\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because K is proportional to sqrt(M_p)/sqrt(a), so a is proportional to M_p / K\u00b2. So the ratio a2/a1 = ( M2 K1\u00b2 ) / ( M1 K2\u00b2 )\n\nNow, let's plug in the numbers.\n\nM1 = 7 Earth masses, M2 = 5 Earth masses.\n\nK1 = 0.03 \u00c5, K2 = 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nSo a2/a1 = (5 * (0.03)^2 ) / (7 * (0.04)^2 )\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute (0.03)^2 = 0.0009, (0.04)^2=0.0016.\n\nSo numerator: 5 * 0.0009 = 0.0045\n\nDenominator:7 * 0.0016 = 0.0112\n\nSo a2/a1 = 0.0045 / 0.0112 \u2248 0.4018.\n\nSo approximately 0.402.\n\nNow, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ) because T_eq \u221d sqrt( (R_star) / (a) )\n\nWait, no, let's get the equilibrium temperature formula correct.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nSince A is the same for both planets, the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2/(a1) ) multiplied by sqrt( R_star / (2a2) ) divided by sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) ), but wait, R_star is the same for both, so it cancels out.\n\nWait, more accurately, T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(a) ). Because the other factors (T_star and (1-A) ) are same for both.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, no, because T_eq is proportional to T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * (1-A)^(1/4). So since R_star and T_star and (1-A) are same for both, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause T_eq \u221d 1/sqrt(a), so T1 = (1/sqrt(a1)) * const, T2 = (1/sqrt(a2)) * const.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )\n\nWe found a2/a1 \u2248 0.4018.\n\nSo sqrt(0.4018) \u2248 0.634.\n\nSo T1/T2 \u2248 0.634. So T1 is cooler than T2.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So it's T1/T2 \u2248 0.634.\n\nLooking at the options: option C is ~0.53, which is lower than 0.634. Option A is ~0.98, which is close to 1. Option D is ~1.05, which is just over 1. Option B is ~1.30. Hmm, none of these exactly match 0.634. Did I make a mistake in my calculation?\n\nWait, let's double-check the a2/a1 calculation.\n\na2/a1 = (M2 * K1\u00b2) / (M1 * K2\u00b2 )\n\nM2=5, M1=7.\n\nK1=0.03, K2=0.04.\n\nSo:\n\n(5 * (0.03)^2 ) / (7 * (0.04)^2 )\n\n= (5 * 0.0009) / (7 * 0.0016 )\n\n= (0.0045) / (0.0112 )\n\n\u2248 0.4018.\n\nSo sqrt(0.4018) \u2248 0.634.\n\nSo T1/T2 is about 0.634. So the ratio is approximately 0.63, which is not exactly any of the options. The options are A: ~0.98, B: ~1.30, C: ~0.53, D: ~1.05.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for a ratio. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\n\nSo T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), because a is in the denominator under the square root.\n\nSo T_eq \u221d 1/sqrt(a). So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) )\n\nWait, no. Because T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a1), T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )\n\nBecause T1 = k / sqrt(a1), T2 = k / sqrt(a2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )\n\nSo with a2/a1 \u2248 0.4018, T1/T2 \u2248 sqrt(0.4018) \u2248 0.634.\n\nBut none of the options are near 0.63. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong in the K ratio approach.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the velocities correctly, considering the Doppler shift.\n\nWait, the RV shift is given as a wavelength shift, so I can calculate the velocity for each planet.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c.\n\nSo v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda )\n\nThe [OI] line is at 6300 \u00c5. So for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03 \u00c5. So v1 = (3e5 km/s) * (0.03 / 6300 )\n\nWait, no, because 1e5 km/s is the speed of light. Wait, c is approximately 3e5 km/s.\n\nSo delta_lambda / lambda = 0.03 / 6300 = 0.0000047619.\n\nSo v1 = 3e5 km/s * 0.0000047619 \u2248 1.42857 km/s.\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2, delta_lambda = 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nv2 = 3e5 km/s * (0.04 /6300) \u2248 3e5 * 0.000006349 \u2248 1.90476 km/s.\n\nSo K1 \u2248 1.4286 km/s, K2 \u22481.9048 km/s.\n\nNow, using the formula for RV semi-amplitude K:\n\nK = ( (G * (M_p) )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c.\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to K \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) / c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for K in terms of a and M_p.\n\nFrom another source, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / sqrt(1 - e\u00b2) ) ) * ( (2 pi / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c \n\nBut since e=0, and M_p << M_star, it simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3 )/( G M_star )\n\nSo P = sqrt( (4 pi\u00b2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )\n\nSo (2 pi / P ) = (2 pi ) / sqrt( (4 pi\u00b2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ) )\n\n= (2 pi ) * sqrt( G M_star ) ) / (2 pi a^(3/2) ) )\n\n= sqrt( G M_star ) / a^(3/2 )\n\nSo (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) = ( G M_star )^(1/6) / a^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting back into K:\n\nK \u2248 ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ) / a^(1/2 ) ) / c \n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nG^(1/3 + 1/6) = G^(1/2)\nM_p^(1/3)\nM_star^( -2/3 +1/6 ) = M_star^(-1/2 )\na^(-1/2)\nc in denominator.\n\nSo K \u2248 ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) c ) )\n\nBut since G and c are constants for both planets, and M_star is same, K is proportional to (M_p^(1/3)) / ( a^(1/2) )\n\nSo K = C * (M_p^(1/3)) / sqrt(a )\n\nRearranging, a = ( C\u00b2 * M_p^(2/3) ) / K\u00b2 \n\nSo for each planet, a is proportional to M_p^(2/3) / K\u00b2.\n\nSo the ratio a2/a1 = ( M2^(2/3) / K2\u00b2 ) / ( M1^(2/3) / K1\u00b2 ) ) = ( M2^(2/3) K1\u00b2 ) / ( M1^(2/3) K2\u00b2 )\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nM1 =7, M2=5.\n\nK1=1.4286 km/s, K2=1.9048 km/s.\n\nCompute each part:\n\nM2^(2/3) =5^(2/3) \u2248 (5^(1/3))^2 \u2248 (1.7099759)^2 \u2248 2.924.\n\nM1^(2/3) =7^(2/3) \u2248 (1.913)^2 \u2248 3.659.\n\nK1^2 = (1.4286)^2 \u2248 2.041.\n\nK2^2 = (1.9048)^2 \u2248 3.628.\n\nSo a2/a1 = (2.924 * 2.041) / (3.659 * 3.628 )\n\nCompute numerator: 2.924 * 2.041 \u2248 5.965.\n\nDenominator: 3.659 *3.628 \u2248 13.28.\n\nSo a2/a1 \u2248 5.965 /13.28 \u2248 0.449.\n\nSo a2/a1 \u2248 0.449.\n\nThen, T_eq ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) \u2248 sqrt(0.449) \u2248 0.67.\n\nStill around 0.67. But the options don't have that. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps I should not have used the velocities calculated from the Doppler shift but instead used the given K values directly. Because the problem stated the shifts in forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, which we converted to velocities. But perhaps the forbidden line's wavelength doesn't matter because we're taking the ratio of K1 and K2, and the same wavelength is used for both, so the ratio K1/K2 would be the same as v1/v2.\n\nWait, in the previous approach, when I used K1=0.03 and K2=0.04 in terms of the shift, perhaps I should have converted them to velocities first.\n\nWait, let's recompute using the velocities.\n\nK1 = 0.03 \u00c5 shift. So v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c.\n\nc is 3e5 km/s, so v1 = (0.03 /6300) *3e5 = (0.03 *3e5 ) /6300 = (9e3) /6300 \u2248 1.4286 km/s.\n\nSimilarly, K2 =0.04 \u00c5, so v2 = (0.04/6300)*3e5 = (0.04 *3e5 ) /6300 = (1.2e4)/6300 \u2248 1.9048 km/s.\n\nSo the earlier calculation is correct.\n\nBut according to the formula, a2/a1 = ( M2^(2/3) K1\u00b2 ) / ( M1^(2/3) K2\u00b2 )\n\nSo plugging in:\n\nM2^(2/3)=5^(2/3)\u22482.924, M1^(2/3)=7^(2/3)\u22483.659\n\nK1^2 = (1.4286)^2\u22482.041, K2^2\u22483.628.\n\nSo:\n\na2/a1 \u2248 (2.924 * 2.041 ) / (3.659 * 3.628 ) \u2248 (5.965 ) / (13.28 )\u22480.449.\n\nThus, a2/a1\u22480.449. So T1/T2 = sqrt(0.449 )\u22480.67.\n\nHmm, but the options are A) ~0.98, B) ~1.30, C) ~0.53, D) ~1.05.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the formula for a.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's calculate a1 and a2 using the RV data.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star )\n\nSo P = (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting into K:\n\nK = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi ) / (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) ) )^(1/3) ) / c \n\nSimplify the denominator inside the cube root:\n\n(4 pi\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) = (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) (a^3 )^(1/2 ) ( G M_star )^(-1/2 )\n\n= 2 pi a^(3/2) ( G M_star )^(-1/2 )\n\nSo (2 pi ) / [ 2 pi a^(3/2) ( G M_star )^(-1/2 ) ) ] = [ (2 pi ) * ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) ) ] / ( 2 pi a^(3/2 ) )\n\n= ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) ) / a^(3/2 )\n\nSo (2 pi / P )^(1/3 ) = [ ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) / a^(3/2 ) ) ]^(1/3 ) \n\n= ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) / a^(1/2 )\n\nPutting it back into K:\n\nK = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) / a^(1/2 ) ) / c \n\nSimplify exponents:\n\nG: (1/3 + 1/6 ) = (2/6 +1/6 )=1/2 \u2192 G^(1/2 )\nM_p: 1/3 \u2192 M_p^(1/3)\nM_star: ( -2/3 +1/6 )= (-4/6 +1/6 )= -3/6 = -1/2 \u2192 M_star^(-1/2)\na: -1/2 \u2192 a^(-1/2)\nc in denominator.\n\nSo K = ( G^(1/2 ) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/2 ) a^(1/2) c )\n\nBut since G and c are constants, and M_star is same for both, K is proportional to ( M_p^(1/3) ) / sqrt(a )\n\nSo K = C * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / sqrt(a )\n\nRearranged, a = C\u00b2 * M_p^(2/3) / K\u00b2 \n\nSo for each planet, a1 = C\u00b2 * M1^(2/3) / K1\u00b2\n\na2 = C\u00b2 * M2^(2/3) / K2\u00b2 \n\nSo a2/a1 = [ M2^(2/3) / K2\u00b2 ] / [ M1^(2/3) / K1\u00b2 ] \n\n= [ M2^(2/3) K1\u00b2 ] / [ M1^(2/3) K2\u00b2 ]\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nM1=7, M2=5.\n\nK1=1.4286, K2=1.9048.\n\nCompute M2^(2/3) =5^(2/3)= (5^1/3)^2\u22481.70997^2\u22482.924.\n\nM1^(2/3)=7^(2/3)= (7^1/3)^2\u22481.913^2\u22483.659.\n\nK1\u00b2= (1.4286)^2\u22482.041.\n\nK2\u00b2= (1.9048)^2\u22483.628.\n\nSo numerator: 2.924 *2.041\u22485.965.\n\nDenominator:3.659 *3.628\u224813.28.\n\na2/a1\u22485.965/13.28\u22480.449.\n\nThus, a2/a1\u22480.449.\n\nSo T_eq ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) \u2248 sqrt(0.449)\u22480.67.\n\nBut again, the options don't have 0.67.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it using the actual formula for equilibrium temperature.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nSince A is the same, the ratio is:\n\nT1/T2 = sqrt( a2/(a1) ) * sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a1) )\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because R_star is the same for both, it cancels out.\n\nWait, let's compute T1/T2 correctly.\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * (1 - A )^(1/4 )\n\nSo T1 = T_star * sqrt( R/(2a1) ) * (1 - A )^(1/4 )\n\nT2 = T_star * sqrt( R/(2a2) ) * (1 - A )^(1/4 )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause R/(2a1) divided by R/(2a2) is (a2/a1).\n\nSo yes, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo with a2/a1\u22480.449, T1/T2\u22480.67.\n\nBut the options don't have this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the approach. Maybe the RV shifts given are not the full semi-amplitude but just the maximum shift. Or perhaps I should have used the actual velocity amplitude correctly.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should use the inverse relation. Because the planet with the larger RV shift (K) is more massive or closer. Wait, no. For a more massive planet, K should be larger, but if it's closer, K would also be larger because a is smaller (since K is inversely proportional to sqrt(a)).\n\nBut in our case, K2 is larger than K1. So Planet2 has a larger RV shift, meaning either it's more massive, or closer, or both.\n\nIn our case, Planet1 has M1=7, Planet2 M2=5. So Planet1 is more massive but has a smaller K. So that suggests that Planet1 is farther away than Planet2.\n\nBecause K is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so larger K means smaller a.\n\nSo Planet2 has a larger K (0.04) than Planet1 (0.03), so Planet2 is closer.\n\nSo a2 < a1.\n\nThus, T_eq is higher for Planet2 because it's closer to the star.\n\nWhich matches our previous conclusion that T1/T2\u22480.67, so T1 is cooler than T2.\n\nBut none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the RV shift isn't directly K but the maximum shift. Or perhaps the problem states the shift is in the forbidden line, which might have a different scaling.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5.\"\n\nSo the shifts are given as 0.03 and 0.04 \u00c5, respectively, in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5.\n\nWait, but the Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v/c.\n\nSo the maximum velocity is v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda )\n\nSo for Planet1: v1 = (3e5 km/s) * (0.03 / 6300 ) \u2248 1.4286 km/s.\n\nPlanet2: v2= (3e5 km/s) * (0.04 /6300 ) \u22481.9048 km/s.\n\nSo K1=1.4286 km/s, K2=1.9048 km/s.\n\nNow, using the formula for K:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3) ) / c \n\nAssuming M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK = ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3) ) / c \n\nFrom Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star )\n\nSo P = (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nSo (2 pi / P ) = (2 pi ) / ( (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) )\n\n= (2 pi ) / ( 2 pi a^(3/2 ) / sqrt( G M_star ) )\n\n= sqrt( G M_star ) / a^(3/2 )\n\nSo (2 pi / P )^(1/3 ) = ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) / a^(1/2 )\n\nPutting it back into K:\n\nK = ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ) / a^(1/2 ) ) / c \n\nSimplify exponents:\n\nG: (1/3 + 1/6 ) = 1/2 \u2192 G^(1/2 )\n\nM_p: 1/3 \u2192 M_p^(1/3 )\n\nM_star: (-2/3 + 1/6 ) = (-1/2 )\n\na: -1/2 \n\nc in denominator.\n\nSo K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) c )\n\nThus, K is proportional to ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( a^(1/2) )\n\nSo a = ( M_p^(2/3) ) / ( K^2 ) * ( G / c^2 ) * ( M_star )\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to express a in terms of K and M_p.\n\nFrom K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) c )\n\nRearranging:\n\na^(1/2 ) = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/2) c K )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\na = [ G M_p^(2/3) ] / ( M_star c^2 K^2 )\n\nSo a = ( G M_p^(2/3) ) / ( M_star c\u00b2 K\u00b2 )\n\nBut since G and c are constants, and M_star is same for both planets, a is proportional to M_p^(2/3) / K\u00b2.\n\nThus, a1 \u221d (7)^(2/3) / (K1)^2, a2 \u221d (5)^(2/3) / (K2)^2.\n\nSo a2/a1 = (5^(2/3)/K2\u00b2) / (7^(2/3)/K1\u00b2) ) = (5^(2/3) K1\u00b2 ) / (7^(2/3) K2\u00b2 )\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n\n5^(2/3)= ~2.924, 7^(2/3)= ~3.659.\n\nK1=1.4286, K2=1.9048.\n\nK1\u00b2=2.041, K2\u00b2=3.628.\n\nSo:\n\na2/a1= (2.924 * 2.041 ) / (3.659 *3.628 ) \n\n= (5.965 ) / (13.28 ) \u2248 0.449.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nThus, T1/T2= sqrt(0.449)= ~0.67.\n\nBut the options don't have this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the actual a1 and a2 using the formula a = ( G M_p^(2/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/2) c\u00b2 K\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but I don't have the actual values for G and c, but perhaps I can compute the ratio without them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express the ratio using the velocity formula.\n\nBecause I have K1 and K2, and M1 and M2.\n\nWait, from the formula K = (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(1/2) )\n\nWait, perhaps I should rearrange this to find a.\n\nWait, K = (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(1/2) )\n\nMultiply both sides by a^(1/2):\n\nK a^(1/2) = (G M_p )^(1/3) / M_star^(2/3 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nK\u00b2 a = (G M_p )^(2/3) / M_star^(4/3 )\n\nSo a = (G M_p )^(2/3) / ( M_star^(4/3) K\u00b2 )\n\nBut G and M_star are same for both, so a is proportional to M_p^(2/3) / K\u00b2.\n\nWhich brings us back to the same ratio.\n\nSo a2/a1= (5^(2/3) K1\u00b2 ) / (7^(2/3) K2\u00b2 )\n\nSo same as before.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is not about the ratio of T_eq, but the inverse.\n\nWait, no. The problem asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which is T1/T2.\n\nBut according to our calculation, it's ~0.67, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I confused the ratio a2/a1 with a1/a2.\n\nBecause the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ), but perhaps I should have taken a1/a2.\n\nWait, let me think again. T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if a2 < a1, then T2 > T1.\n\nSo T1/T2 is less than 1.\n\nSo if a2/a1 is 0.449, then sqrt(0.449) is about 0.67.\n\nBut perhaps the problem uses the inverse ratio.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for T2/T1 instead of T1/T2. Because looking at the options, option B is ~1.3, which is approximately 1/0.77. So 1.3 is approximately 1/0.77, which is about 1.3.\n\nWait, but the question clearly says \"the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2\", which is T1/T2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and it should be T_eq proportional to sqrt( a ), which would invert the ratio.\n\nWait, no. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )\n\nSo as a increases, T_eq decreases.\n\nSo if a2 < a1, then T2 > T1.\n\nSo T1/T2 <1.\n\nBut the options only have A) ~0.98, C) ~0.53, and D) ~1.05. Option B is ~1.30, which is above 1.\n\nSo perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.53.\n\nWait, how could that be? Let's see. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, if a2/a1 is 0.449, then sqrt(0.449)=0.67.\n\nBut perhaps I should have used a1/a2.\n\nWait, no, because T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the formula should be T_eq = T_star * (R_star/(2a))^(1/2) * (1-A)^(1/4 )\n\nWhich is same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have considered the star's luminosity.\n\nThe star's luminosity L =4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_eff^4.\n\nThe flux at the planet's distance is F= L/(4 pi a^2 )= sigma T_eff^4 R_star^2 / a^2.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is T_eq = [ (1 - A) F / sigma ]^(1/4 )\n\n= [ (1 - A) ( T_eff^4 R_star^2 / a^2 ) / sigma ]^(1/4 )\n\n= T_eff * R_star^(1/2 ) / a^(1/2 ) * (1 - A )^(1/4 )\n\nSo T_eq = T_eff * sqrt( R_star ) / sqrt(a ) * (1 - A )^(1/4 )\n\nWhich is same as before.\n\nSo the ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo I think the calculation is correct, but the options don't include ~0.67.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a2/a1.\n\nLet me recompute:\n\nM2=5, M1=7.\n\nK1=1.4286, K2=1.9048.\n\nCompute (M2^(2/3) * K1^2 ) / ( M1^(2/3) * K2^2 )\n\nM2^(2/3)=5^(2/3)= (cube root of 5)^2\u2248 (1.710)^2\u22482.924.\n\nK1^2= (1.4286)^2\u22482.041.\n\nM1^(2/3)=7^(2/3)= (cube root of 7)^2\u2248 (1.913)^2\u22483.659.\n\nK2^2= (1.9048)^2\u22483.628.\n\nSo numerator: 2.924 * 2.041\u22485.965.\n\nDenominator:3.659 *3.628\u224813.28.\n\n5.965 /13.28\u22480.449.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute a2/a1 using the velocities, considering that a is inversely proportional to K^2 and directly proportional to M_p^(2/3).\n\nWait, a = ( M_p^(2/3) ) / ( K^2 )\n\nSo a1=7^(2/3)/K1^2, a2=5^(2/3)/K2^2.\n\nSo a2/a1= (5^(2/3)/K2^2 ) / (7^(2/3)/K1^2 ) ) = (5^2/3 K1^2 )/(7^2/3 K2^2 )\n\nWhich is same as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the RV method gives the same shift for both planets, but no, the shifts are different.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the distance ratio using the RV semi-amplitude formula correctly, including the actual masses.\n\nWait, the formula is K = [ (27 pi G )^(1/3) ) * M_p sin i ] / [ (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) c ] * ( 1 / (P )^(1/3) )\n\nBut without knowing P, perhaps we can find a relation between a1 and a2.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that P^2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3)/( G M_star )\n\nSo for each planet, a = [ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nBut from the RV formula, K = [ (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3 ) * (1/ c ) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's think of the ratio.\n\nSince the problem gives us the RV shifts (K) for both planets, and their masses, and we need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.\n\nWe have to find T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nWe have a2/a1 = (M2^(2/3) K1\u00b2 ) / ( M1^(2/3) K2\u00b2 )\n\nPlugging in the numbers again:\n\nM2=5, M1=7.\n\nK1=1.4286, K2=1.9048.\n\nSo M2^(2/3)=5^(2/3)=~2.924.\n\nM1^(2/3)=7^(2/3)=~3.659.\n\nK1\u00b2=2.041, K2\u00b2=3.628.\n\nSo a2/a1= (2.924 *2.041)/(3.659 *3.628 )=5.965 /13.28\u22480.449.\n\nSo T1/T2=sqrt(0.449 )=0.67.\n\nBut the options don't have this.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that the RV shift is given in wavelength, and I should have used the inverse of the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for a is a = (G M_star )/(K^2 ), but I think that's only when K is the velocity due to the star's movement, and other factors are considered.\n\nWait, let's think about the formula a = (G M_star )/(K^2 )\n\nWait, no, because K is v = (G M_p )/(a )^(1/2 ), but this is only when M_p << M_star.\n\nWait, perhaps a = (G M_p )/(K^2 )\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have used a = ( (G M_star )^(1/2) ) / ( K )\n\nWait, no, because K = sqrt( G M_star / a ), so a = G M_star / K\u00b2.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because K is in velocity units (km/s), and G has units of m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the formula a = (G M_star )/(K^2 ), but units-wise, that may not work.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a = ( (G M_star ) ) / ( v^2 )\n\nBut v is in m/s, G is m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.\n\nSo a would have units m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * s^2 m^-2 = m.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo let's compute a in meters.\n\nBut that's a lot of computation, but let's try.\n\nG = 6.67430e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.\n\nM_star = 1.5 * M_sun. M_sun is ~1.9885e30 kg. So M_star = 1.5 *1.9885e30 \u22482.98275e30 kg.\n\nv1=1.4286 km/s = 1428.6 m/s.\n\na1 = G*M_star/(v1^2 )\n\n= (6.6743e-11 ) * (2.98275e30 ) / (1428.6^2 )\n\nCalculate numerator: 6.6743e-11 * 2.98275e30 \u2248 (6.6743 *2.98275 )e19 \u224819.88e19 = 1.988e20.\n\nDenominator: (1428.6)^2 \u22482.041e6 m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nSo a1= 1.988e20 / 2.041e6 \u22489.736e13 meters.\n\nSimilarly, a2:\n\nv2=1.9048 km/s =1904.8 m/s.\n\na2 = (6.6743e-11 *2.98275e30 ) / (1904.8^2 )\n\nNumerator same as before: ~1.988e20.\n\nDenominator: (1904.8)^2 \u22483.628e6 m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\na2=1.988e20 /3.628e6 \u22485.48e13 meters.\n\nSo a1=9.736e13 m, a2=5.48e13 m.\n\nSo a2/a1=5.48e13 /9.736e13 \u22480.5625.\n\nSo a2/a1\u22480.5625.\n\nThus, T1/T2= sqrt(0.5625 )=0.75.\n\nHmm, 0.75 is still not in the options. But option C is 0.53, which is lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.\n\nCompute a1:\n\nv1=1428.6 m/s.\n\nv1\u00b2= (1428.6 )^2 = 2,041,193.96 m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\na1= G*M_star/(v1\u00b2 )= (6.6743e-11 *2.98275e30 ) / 2.041194e6.\n\nNumerator:6.6743e-11 *2.98275e30 = (6.6743 *2.98275 )e19 = 19.88e19 =1.988e20.\n\nSo a1=1.988e20 / 2.041194e6 \u2248 9.737e13 meters.\n\na2:\n\nv2=1904.8 m/s.\n\nv2\u00b2= (1904.8 )^2=3,628, 383.04 m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\na2=6.6743e-11 *2.98275e30 /3.628383e6.\n\n=1.988e20 /3.628383e6 \u22485.48e13 meters.\n\na2/a1=5.48e13 /9.737e13\u22480.5625.\n\nSo T1/T2= sqrt(0.5625 )=0.75.\n\nStill not matching any option.\n\nWait, perhaps the RV shift given is the semi-amplitude, which is already the maximum velocity. So the approach is correct.\n\nBut the options don't have 0.75.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the RV shift is given as the full Doppler shift (both sides), but I think that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses the inverse of the ratio.\n\nWait, maybe the ratio is T2/T1 = 1/0.75 \u22481.333. Which is close to option B) ~1.30.\n\nBut the question asks for T1/T2, which would be 0.75, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be T_eq proportional to sqrt( a ), which would invert the ratio.\n\nIf that were the case, T1/T2= sqrt( a1/a2 )= sqrt(1/0.5625 )=sqrt(1.777 )=1.333.\n\nWhich would match option B.\n\nBut that would be incorrect because T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), not directly.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the equilibrium temperature formula.\n\nWait, the equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_eq = [ (L (1 - A) )/(16 pi sigma a\u00b2 ) ]^(1/4 )\n\nWhere L is the star's luminosity.\n\nL =4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_eff^4.\n\nSubstituting:\n\nT_eq = [ (4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_eff^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a\u00b2 ) ) ]^(1/4 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ ( R_star^2 T_eff^4 (1 - A) ) / (4 a\u00b2 ) ) ]^(1/4 )\n\n= [ ( R_star^2 / (4 a\u00b2 ) ) * T_eff^4 (1 - A) ) ]^(1/4 )\n\n= T_eff * ( R_star / (2 a ) )^(1/2 ) * (1 - A )^(1/4 )\n\nWhich is same as before.\n\nThus, T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so the ratio T1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nWhich gives 0.75.\n\nBut the options don't have 0.75.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a2/a1.\n\nWait, a2/a1=0.5625.\n\nsqrt(0.5625)=0.75.\n\nYes.\n\nBut perhaps the problem uses a different approach, considering that the RV semi-amplitude is proportional to (M_p sin i )/(a^(1/2) )\n\nThus, K \u221d M_p / sqrt(a )\n\nSo a \u221d M_p\u00b2 / K\u00b2.\n\nSo a2/a1= (M2\u00b2 K1\u00b2 ) / (M1\u00b2 K2\u00b2 )\n\nAh! Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier formula.\n\nBecause K is proportional to (M_p )/( sqrt(a) ), so a is proportional to M_p\u00b2 / K\u00b2.\n\nSo a2/a1= (M2\u00b2 K1\u00b2 ) / ( M1\u00b2 K2\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nM2=5, M1=7.\n\nK1=1.4286, K2=1.9048.\n\nSo:\n\na2/a1= (5^2 * (1.4286)^2 ) / (7^2 * (1.9048)^2 )\n\n= (25 * 2.041 ) / (49 * 3.628 )\n\n= (51.025 ) / (177.772 )\n\n\u22480.287.\n\nSo a2/a1\u22480.287.\n\nThus, T1/T2= sqrt(0.287 )\u22480.537.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.54, close to option C) ~0.53.\n\nAh! So perhaps the correct approach is a2/a1= (M2\u00b2 K1\u00b2 )/(M1\u00b2 K2\u00b2 )\n\nWhich gives a2/a1=0.287, T1/T2= ~0.54.\n\nSo the answer would be option C) ~0.53.\n\nBut why did I get a different ratio earlier? Because earlier, I thought a is proportional to M_p^(2/3)/ K\u00b2, but perhaps it's M_p\u00b2/K\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the RV formula.\n\nThe correct formula is K = (v ) = ( (G M_p ) / (a ) )^(1/2 )\n\nBecause from earlier, K = sqrt( G M_star / a ), but that doesn't include the planet's mass. Wait, no.\n\nWait, the correct formula for RV semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = (v ) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2 pi ) / (P ) )^(1/3) ) / c \n\nBut when M_p << M_star, this simplifies to K \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / (M_star ) )^(1/3 ) * ( 2 pi / P )^(1/3 ) ) / c \n\nFrom Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3 )/( G M_star )\n\nSo P = (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting into K:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi ) / ( (4 pi\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) ) )^(1/3 ) ) / c \n\nSimplify the denominator inside the cube root:\n\n(4 pi\u00b2 a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) = (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/2 ) * (a^3 )^(1/2 ) * ( G M_star )^(-1/2 )\n\n= 2 pi a^(3/2) ( G M_star )^(-1/2 )\n\nSo (2 pi ) / denominator = (2 pi ) / (2 pi a^(3/2 ) ( G M_star )^(-1/2 ) ) )\n\n= (2 pi ) * ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) ) / (2 pi a^(3/2 ) )\n\n= ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) / a^(3/2 )\n\nSo (2 pi / P )^(1/3 )= [ ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) / a^(3/2 ) ]^(1/3 ) \n\n= ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) / a^(1/2 )\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nK \u2248 ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) / M_star^(1/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ) / a^(1/2 ) ) / c \n\nSimplify exponents:\n\nG: (1/3 +1/6 )= 1/2 \u2192 G^(1/2 )\n\nM_p: 1/3 \u2192 M_p^(1/3 )\n\nM_star: (-1/3 +1/6 )= (-1/6 )\n\na: -1/2 \n\nc in denominator.\n\nSo K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/6) a^(1/2) c )\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nK = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( ( M_star^(1/3) )^(1/2) a^(1/2) c )\n\n= ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( ( M_star^(1/2) a )^(1/2) c )\n\n= ( G M_p^(2/3) )^(1/2) / ( M_star^(1/2) a )^(1/2) c )\n\n= sqrt( G M_p^(2/3) ) / ( sqrt( M_star a ) c )\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to express a in terms of K and M_p.\n\nRearranging:\n\na = [ ( G M_p^(2/3) ) / ( K c^2 M_star^(1/2) ) ) ]^(something )\n\nAlternatively, let's square both sides of K equation:\n\nK^2 = ( G M_p^(2/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/3) a ) ) / c\u00b2 \n\nSo K^2 = ( G M_p^(2/3) ) / ( c\u00b2 M_star^(1/3) a )\n\nRearranged:\n\na = ( G M_p^(2/3) ) / ( c\u00b2 M_star^(1/3) K^2 )\n\nThus, a is proportional to M_p^(2/3) / K\u00b2.\n\nWhich brings us back to the earlier approach.\n\nSo the correct ratio is a2/a1= (M2^(2/3) K1\u00b2 ) / ( M1^(2/3) K2\u00b2 )\n\nWhich gives 0.449.\n\nSo T1/T2= sqrt(0.449 )=0.67.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the RV semi-amplitude formula to be K = (v ) = ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star ) )^(1/3 ) * ( 1 / sqrt(a) )\n\nWhich would make K proportional to M_p^(1/3) / sqrt(a )\n\nSo a proportional to M_p^(2/3) / K\u00b2.\n\nWhich again leads to the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the planet masses and assume a is proportional to (M_p K )^{-1}.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula a = ( (G M_star )/( K^2 ) )\n\nWhich would give a = (6.67e-11 * 1.5 *2e30 kg )/( (v )^2 )\n\nBut earlier calculation with that gave a2/a1=0.5625, T1/T2=0.75.\n\nBut the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses the Doppler shift without considering the star's mass correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures using the inverse square root of the distance ratio.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think the intended answer is option C) ~0.53, based on a different approach where a2/a1=0.287.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should select option C) ~0.53.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{eq}} = T_{\\text{eff}} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a}} \\left(1 - A\\right)^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo (\\(A\\)), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) are the orbital distances of Planet1 and Planet2, respectively.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets orbiting a star. Both planets have been detected using transit and radial velocity methods. I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull, which causes the star to move back and forth. The transit method measures the dip in brightness as the planet passes in front of the star.\n\nThe star's parameters are given: mass is 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times the Sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. So, the star is a bit more massive and larger than the Sun, but a similar temperature. Interesting.\n\nPlanet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have circular orbits and the same albedo, which I think is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect, but in equilibrium temperature calculations, albedo comes into play since the planet reflects some of the incident light.\n\nThe question gives some data about the Doppler shifts caused by each planet. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5, while Planet2 causes a 0.04 \u00c5 shift. Wait, but how does that relate to their orbital velocities or distances?\n\nI remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance between them. The RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity the star moves toward or away from us. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity. But wait, in this problem, the shifts are given in terms of wavelength change, so maybe I can find the velocities from that.\n\nWait, but the shifts are given as 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5 for each planet. The original line is at 6300 \u00c5. So for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03 \u00c5, so delta_lambda / lambda = 0.03 / 6300 = approximately 4.76e-6. Assuming that this is due to the star's velocity, the velocity v is (delta_lambda / lambda) * c. But wait, the Doppler shift formula is (v/c) = (delta_lambda / lambda), but actually, the exact formula depends on whether it's a shift to longer or shorter wavelengths. For a star moving towards us, the wavelength would be blueshifted (shorter), and moving away would be redshifted (longer). But the given shifts are absolute, so maybe the maximum shift is 0.03 or 0.04.\n\nAlternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = (2.15e5 m/s) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1+M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The problem gives the maximum Doppler shifts for each planet. So, for Planet1, the maximum shift is 0.03 \u00c5, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 \u00c5. The formula for the Doppler shift (in terms of velocity) is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. So, for each planet, I can find their respective velocities.\n\nLet me compute v for each planet. \n\nFor Planet1: delta_lambda = 0.03 \u00c5, lambda = 6300 \u00c5.\n\nv1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c.\n\nc is approximately 3e8 m/s, but wait, I should make sure about the units. Let's compute delta_lambda in meters and lambda in meters as well. \n\nWait, 1 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m is 1e-10 meters. So, 0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-12 meters, and 6300 \u00c5 is 6300e-10 meters, which is 6.3e-7 meters.\n\nSo, delta_lambda / lambda = (3e-12) / (6.3e-7) ) = (3e-12) / (6.3e-7) ) = approximately 4.76e-6.\n\nv1 = (4.76e-6) * c.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s, so v1 = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 = approx 1.428e3 m/s, which is about 1428 m/s.\n\nWait, that seems really high. Wait, wait a second. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the Earth's RV semi-amplitude for the Sun is about 9 m/s, so 1428 m/s is way too high. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio correctly. Let me recompute.\n\n0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-12 m. 6300 \u00c5 is 6.3e-7 m.\n\ndelta_lambda / lambda = (3e-12) / (6.3e-7) ) = (3 / 6.3) * 1e-5 = 0.476e-5 = 4.76e-6.\n\nv = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 m/s.\n\n4.76e-6 * 3e8 = (4.76 * 3) * 1e2 = 14.28 * 100 = 1428 m/s. Hmm, that's what I got before, but that's way too high. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Oh wait, perhaps the shift is in the same line, so it's the full Doppler shift, but perhaps I should use the formula correctly.\n\nWait, the Doppler formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, but that's only for non-relativistic speeds, which is the case here. So, the calculation seems correct, but that velocity seems way too high. Wait, but the RV semi-amplitude K is usually a few tens of m/s for Jupiter-like planets. So, getting 1400 m/s would imply a very massive planet or a very tight orbit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the semi-amplitude K with the actual velocity. Because K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, so the maximum velocity is K. So, maybe the given 0.03 \u00c5 is the semi-amplitude, not the full shift. Because the RV method measures the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. So, perhaps the shift given is the semi-amplitude, not the full delta. So, for Planet1, the semi-amplitude K1 is 0.03 \u00c5, and K2 is 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5... while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5.\" So 'up to' suggests that's the maximum shift, which would be the semi-amplitude. So, yes, K1 is 0.03 \u00c5 and K2 is 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nSo, let me recalculate the velocities using these semi-amplitudes.\n\nv1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * c.\n\nWait, 0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-12 m. 6300 \u00c5 is 6.3e-7 m. So, delta_lambda / lambda = 3e-12 / 6.3e-7 = 4.76e-6.\n\nv1 = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 m/s = 1.428e3 m/s. That's 1428 m/s, which is still way too high. That can't be right because K is usually in m/s, not km/s. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the units.\n\nWait, 0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-10 meters? Wait, no, 1 \u00c5 is 1e-10 meters. So 0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-12 meters. 6300 \u00c5 is 6300e-10 meters = 6.3e-7 meters.\n\nSo, delta_lambda/lambda = (3e-12) / (6.3e-7) = (3/6.3) * 1e-5 = 0.476e-5 = 4.76e-6.\n\nv = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 = (4.76 * 3) * 1e2 = 14.28 * 100 = 1428 m/s.\n\nWait, that's 1.4 km/s. That's way too high for a planet's RV semi-amplitude. For example, Jupiter's RV semi-amplitude is about 12.5 m/s. So this suggests that the planet is causing a much larger shift, which would imply a very massive planet or very close orbit.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the star's mass is 1.5 solar masses. So, perhaps the formula for RV semi-amplitude is different. Let me recall the formula for K:\n\nK = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (1) / ( (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ]\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the simplified version. Another formula I've come across is:\n\nK = ( ( (G * M_p^3 * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (2 pi)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to relate the RV semi-amplitude K to the orbital period and distance. Because I also know that the transit method gives the orbital period and the size of the planet relative to the star.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't give the orbital periods or distances. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets, which would then allow me to compute the equilibrium temperatures.\n\nWait, equilibrium temperature for a planet is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )\n\nWait, no, the exact formula is a bit different. Let me recall the equilibrium temperature equation. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * ( ( R_star ) / (2 a) )^(1/2) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) )\n\nWhere:\n- T_eq is the equilibrium temperature of the planet,\n- T_star is the star's effective temperature,\n- R_star is the star's radius,\n- a is the planet's orbital distance from the star,\n- A is the planet's albedo.\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the (1-A) term cancels out when taking the ratio. So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures will depend on the square root of (R_star / (2 a)) for each planet.\n\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) ) )\n\nBecause:\n\nT_eq \u221d sqrt(R_star/(2a)), so when taking the ratio, R_star is same for both, so T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo, if I can find the ratio a2/a1, I can find the temperature ratio.\n\nSo, how to find a1 and a2? Well, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. But I don't have the periods. Alternatively, since both planets are detected via RV and transit, perhaps I can find their orbital periods from the transit data.\n\nWait, but the transit method gives the orbital period, because the planet must return to the same position in its orbit each time it transits. So, the period P is the time between transits. But the problem doesn't give the periods for the planets, so maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, but the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital distance. Let me recall the formula for K.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (2 pi G) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) / ( (P) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut since the orbits are circular (e=0), the denominator becomes 1. Also, since M_p << M_star (for both planets, as 5 and 7 Earth masses vs 1.5 solar masses; 1 solar mass is about 333,000 Earth masses), M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So, the formula simplifies.\n\nK \u2248 ( (2 pi G) / c )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) / ( P^(1/3) )\n\nBut for circular orbits and edge-on (i=90 degrees, so sin i =1), this simplifies further.\n\nBut I don't have P for either planet, but perhaps the transit method gives the orbital period. Let me think. The transit method allows us to find the orbital period because the time between transits is the period. But the problem doesn't provide the periods. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Doppler shifts can be used to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, which is what I need for the temperature ratio.\n\nWait, because K is proportional to (M_p / a^1.5) ), since K depends on (M_p) / (a^(3/2)) ), because K is proportional to (M_p) / (a^(3/2) ) ), because from Kepler's third law, a^3 \u221d (M_star + M_p) * P^2, but since M_p << M_star, a^3 \u221d M_star * P^2. So, P is related to a^(3/2) / sqrt(M_star).\n\nWait, perhaps I should express K in terms of a.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, the orbital period P is given by:\n\nP^2 = (4 pi^2 / (G M_star)) ) * a^3\n\nSo, P = ( (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_star) )^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting P into the K equation.\n\nK = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/( P^(1/3) )) )\n\nSubstituting P from above:\n\nP^(1/3) = [ (4 pi^2 a^3)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 )\n\nSo,\n\nK = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * [ (G M_star)/(4 pi^2 a^3) ) ]^(1/6 )\n\nSimplify this expression.\n\nLet me write exponents:\n\n(2 pi G )^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) G^(1/3)\n\nM_p is as is.\n\nM_star^(2/3) in denominator.\n\nThen, the term [ G M_star / (4 pi^2 a^3) ) ]^(1/6 ) = G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) a^(-1/2) (4 pi^2)^(-1/6)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nK = [ 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) G^(1/3) ] * [ M_p ] * [ G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) a^(-1/2) (4 pi^2)^(-1/6) ) ] / [ M_star^(2/3) ) ]\n\nCombine the terms:\n\nG exponents: 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2.\n\nM_p: M_p.\n\nM_star exponents: 1/6 - 2/3 = 1/6 -4/6= -3/6 = -1/2.\n\na exponents: -1/2.\n\nConstants:\n\n2^(1/3) * (4 pi^2)^(-1/6) ) = 2^(1/3) * (2^2 pi^2)^(-1/6) ) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-1/3) pi^(-1/3) ) = pi^(-1/3)\n\npi terms: pi^(1/3) * pi^(-1/3) ) = 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nK = ( G^(1/2) M_p ) * ( a^(-1/2) ) * ( M_star^(-1/2) ) ) * ( 1 ) \n\nWait, let me check the exponents again.\n\nWait, the M_star term: 1/6 (from the numerator) and then divided by M_star^(2/3) which is M_star^(-2/3). So overall exponent is (1/6 - 2/3) = (1/6 -4/6) = (-3/6)= -1/2.\n\nSo, K = [ G^(1/2) * M_p * M_star^(-1/2) ) / a^(1/2) ) ] * [ other constants ]\n\nWait, but what's left of the constants? We had pi terms canceling, 2 terms as well.\n\nSo, K = ( M_p ) * ( sqrt(G) ) / ( sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a) ) ) * [ some constants ]\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express K as:\n\nK = ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star ) )^(1/2) * ( 1 / a )^(1/2) ) * ( 2 pi )^(1/3) ) [maybe?]\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use another approach. Let's think about the ratio of K for Planet1 and Planet2.\n\nK1 / K2 = [ (M_p1 / a1^1.5 ) / (M_p2 / a2^1.5 ) ) ] * [ (M_star2 / M_star1 )^(1/3) ) ]\n\nWait, but the stars are the same, so M_star1 = M_star2 = 1.5 solar masses. So the ratio would be (M_p1 / M_p2) * (a2 / a1 )^(1.5) )\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write the K formula again.\n\nThe correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_J) ) * ( (M_J) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1 yr) / P )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, another version I found online is:\n\nK = ( ( (G * M_p^3 * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) / ( (2 pi )^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )\n\nHmm, but perhaps a better approach is to recall that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)) )\n\nBut without knowing P, maybe I can find a relationship between a1 and a2.\n\nWait, from Kepler's third law:\n\nP^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3)/(G (M_star + M_p))\n\nSince M_p is much smaller than M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nP^2 \u2248 (4 pi^2 a^3)/(G M_star)\n\nSo, a^3 = (G M_star P^2)/(4 pi^2 )\n\nThus, a = [ ( G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo, a is proportional to (M_star^(1/3) ) * (P^(2/3) )\n\nBut I don't know P, so perhaps I can express the ratio a1/a2 in terms of K1 and K2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express K in terms of a.\n\nFrom the K formula,\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (2 pi )^(1/3) P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3)/(G M_star )\n\nSo, P = ( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting into K:\n\nK = ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (2 pi )^(1/3) ( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )^(1/6 ) ) )\n\nWait, let's compute the denominator:\n\n(2 pi )^(1/3) * [ (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_star )) ) ]^(1/6 )\n\n= (2 pi )^(1/3) * (4 pi^2 )^(1/6) a^(1/2) (G M_star )^(-1/6 )\n\n= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) * (4^(1/6) pi^(2/6) ) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n4^(1/6) is 2^(2/6) = 2^(1/3). So,\n\n= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6 )\n\n= 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6 )\n\nNow, the numerator in K is:\n\n( G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) )\n\nSo, K = [ (G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / M_star^(2/3) ) ] / [ 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6) ) ]\n\nSimplify the numerator and denominator:\n\n= ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / M_star^(2/3) ) * 1/( 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6) ) )\n\n= M_p^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * G^(1/3 + 1/6 ) * 1/( 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(-1/6) )\n\nG exponents: 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2.\n\nM_star exponents: -2/3 + 1/6 = (-4/6 + 1/6 ) = (-3/6) = -1/2.\n\nSo,\n\n= M_p^(1/3) * G^(1/2) / ( 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) )\n\n= [ M_p^(1/3) G^(1/2) ] / [ 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ]\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps I can express a in terms of K.\n\nAlternatively, let's rearrange for a.\n\na^(1/2) = [ M_p^(1/3) G^(1/2) ] / ( 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) K M_star^(1/2) ) )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\na = [ M_p^(2/3) G ] / ( 2^(4/3) pi^(4/3) K^2 M_star )\n\nSo,\n\na = [ (M_p^2 G ) ] / ( 2^(4/3) pi^(4/3) K^2 M_star )\n\nThus, a is proportional to (M_p^2) / ( K^2 M_star )\n\nSo, for each planet:\n\na1 \u221d (M_p1^2 ) / ( K1^2 M_star )\n\na2 \u221d (M_p2^2 ) / ( K2^2 M_star )\n\nSo, the ratio a1/a2 is [ (M_p1^2 / K1^2) ] / [ (M_p2^2 / K2^2) ] )\n\nBecause M_star is the same for both.\n\na1/a2 = (M_p1^2 / K1^2 ) * ( K2^2 / M_p2^2 )\n\n= ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^2 ) * ( (K2/K1)^2 )\n\n= ( (7 /5 )^2 ) * ( (0.04 / 0.03 )^2 )\n\nCompute this:\n\n7/5 = 1.4 \u2192 (1.4)^2 = 1.96\n\n0.04/0.03 = 4/3 \u2248 1.3333 \u2192 (4/3)^2 = 16/9 \u2248 1.7778\n\nMultiply: 1.96 * 1.7778 \u2248 3.500\n\nSo, a1/a2 \u2248 3.5\n\nThus, a1 = 3.5 a2\n\nBut wait, I'm getting a1/a2 as approximately 3.5. So, a1 is larger than a2.\n\nBut equilibrium temperature depends on sqrt(R_star/(2a)), so T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).\n\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause:\n\nT_eq \u221d sqrt( R_star/(2a) )\n\nSo,\n\n(T_eq1)/(T_eq2) = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) )\n\nSince a1/a2 = 3.5 \u2192 a2/a1 = 1/3.5 \u2248 0.2857\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(0.2857) \u2248 0.5345\n\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq2 \u2248 0.5345 \u2192 approximately 0.53\n\nSo, the ratio is about 0.53, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets orbiting a star. Both planets have been detected using transit and radial velocity methods. I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull, which causes the star to move back and forth. The transit method measures the dip in brightness as the planet passes in front of the star.\n\nThe star's parameters are given: mass is 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times the Sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. So, the star is a bit more massive and larger than the Sun, but a similar temperature. Interesting.\n\nPlanet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have circular orbits and the same albedo, which I think is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect, but in equilibrium temperature calculations, albedo comes into play since the planet reflects some of the incident light.\n\nThe question gives some data about the Doppler shifts caused by each planet. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5, while Planet2 causes a 0.04 \u00c5 shift. Wait, but how does that relate to their orbital velocities or distances?\n\nI remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance between them. The RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity the star moves toward or away from us. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity. But wait, in this problem, the shifts are given in terms of wavelength change, so maybe I can find the velocities from that.\n\nWait, but the shifts are given as 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5 for each planet. The original line is at 6300 \u00c5. So for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03 \u00c5, so delta_lambda / lambda = 0.03 / 6300 = approximately 4.76e-6. Assuming that this is due to the star's velocity, the velocity v is (delta_lambda / lambda) * c. But wait, the Doppler shift formula is (v/c) = (delta_lambda / lambda), but actually, the exact formula depends on whether it's a shift to longer or shorter wavelengths. For a star moving towards us, the wavelength would be blueshifted (shorter), and moving away would be redshifted (longer). But the given shifts are absolute, so maybe the maximum shift is 0.03 or 0.04.\n\nAlternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = (2.15e5 m/s) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1+M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The problem gives the maximum Doppler shifts for each planet. So, for Planet1, the maximum shift is 0.03 \u00c5, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 \u00c5. The formula for the Doppler shift (in terms of velocity) is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. So, for each planet, I can find their respective velocities.\n\nLet me compute v for each planet. \n\nFor Planet1: delta_lambda = 0.03 \u00c5, lambda = 6300 \u00c5.\n\nv1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c.\n\nc is approximately 3e8 m/s, but wait, I should make sure about the units. Let's compute delta_lambda in meters and lambda in meters as well. \n\nWait, 1 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m is 1e-10 meters. So, 0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-12 meters, and 6300 \u00c5 is 6300e-10 meters, which is 6.3e-7 meters.\n\nSo, delta_lambda / lambda = (3e-12) / (6.3e-7) ) = (3e-12) / (6.3e-7) ) = approximately 4.76e-6.\n\nv1 = (4.76e-6) * c.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s, so v1 = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 = approx 1.428e3 m/s, which is about 1428 m/s.\n\nWait, that seems really high. Wait, wait a second. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the Earth's RV semi-amplitude for the Sun is about 9 m/s, so 1428 m/s is way too high. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio correctly. Let me recompute.\n\n0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-12 m. 6300 \u00c5 is 6.3e-7 m.\n\ndelta_lambda / lambda = (3e-12) / (6.3e-7) ) = (3 / 6.3) * 1e-5 = 0.476e-5 = 4.76e-6.\n\nv = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 m/s.\n\n4.76e-6 * 3e8 = (4.76 * 3) * 1e2 = 14.28 * 100 = 1428 m/s. Hmm, that's what I got before, but that's way too high. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Oh wait, perhaps the shift is in the same line, so it's the full Doppler shift, but perhaps I should use the formula correctly.\n\nWait, the Doppler formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, but that's only for non-relativistic speeds, which is the case here. So, the calculation seems correct, but that velocity seems way too high. Wait, but the RV semi-amplitude K is usually a few tens of m/s for Jupiter-like planets. So, getting 1400 m/s would imply a very massive planet or a very tight orbit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the semi-amplitude K with the actual velocity. Because K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, so the maximum velocity is K. So, maybe the given 0.03 \u00c5 is the semi-amplitude, not the full shift. Because the RV method measures the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. So, perhaps the shift given is the semi-amplitude, not the full delta. So, for Planet1, the semi-amplitude K1 is 0.03 \u00c5, and K2 is 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5... while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5.\" So 'up to' suggests that's the maximum shift, which would be the semi-amplitude. So, yes, K1 is 0.03 \u00c5 and K2 is 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nSo, let me recalculate the velocities using these semi-amplitudes.\n\nv1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * c.\n\nWait, 0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-12 m. 6300 \u00c5 is 6.3e-7 m. So, delta_lambda / lambda = 3e-12 / 6.3e-7 = 4.76e-6.\n\nv1 = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 m/s = 1.428e3 m/s. That's 1428 m/s, which is still way too high. That can't be right because K is usually in m/s, not km/s. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the units.\n\nWait, 0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-10 meters? Wait, no, 1 \u00c5 is 1e-10 meters. So 0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-12 meters. 6300 \u00c5 is 6300e-10 meters = 6.3e-7 meters.\n\nSo, delta_lambda/lambda = (3e-12) / (6.3e-7) = (3/6.3) * 1e-5 = 0.476e-5 = 4.76e-6.\n\nv = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 = (4.76 * 3) * 1e2 = 14.28 * 100 = 1428 m/s.\n\nWait, that's 1.4 km/s. That's way too high for a planet's RV semi-amplitude. For example, Jupiter's RV semi-amplitude is about 12.5 m/s. So this suggests that the planet is causing a much larger shift, which would imply a very massive planet or very close orbit.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the star's mass is 1.5 solar masses. So, perhaps the formula for RV semi-amplitude is different. Let me recall the formula for K:\n\nK = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (1) / ( (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ]\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the simplified version. Another formula I've come across is:\n\nK = ( ( (G * M_p^3 * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (2 pi)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to relate the RV semi-amplitude K to the orbital period and distance. Because I also know that the transit method gives the orbital period and the size of the planet relative to the star.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't give the orbital periods or distances. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets, which would then allow me to compute the equilibrium temperatures.\n\nWait, equilibrium temperature for a planet is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )\n\nWait, no, the exact formula is a bit different. Let me recall the equilibrium temperature equation. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * ( ( R_star ) / (2 a) )^(1/2) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) )\n\nWhere:\n- T_eq is the equilibrium temperature of the planet,\n- T_star is the star's effective temperature,\n- R_star is the star's radius,\n- a is the planet's orbital distance from the star,\n- A is the planet's albedo.\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the (1-A) term cancels out when taking the ratio. So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures will depend on the square root of (R_star / (2 a)) for each planet.\n\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) ) )\n\nBecause:\n\nT_eq \u221d sqrt(R_star/(2a)), so when taking the ratio, R_star is same for both, so T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo, if I can find the ratio a2/a1, I can find the temperature ratio.\n\nSo, how to find a1 and a2? Well, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. But I don't have the periods. Alternatively, since both planets are detected via RV and transit, perhaps I can find their orbital periods from the transit data.\n\nWait, but the transit method gives the orbital period, because the planet must return to the same position in its orbit each time it transits. So, the period P is the time between transits. But the problem doesn't give the periods for the planets, so maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, but the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital distance. Let me recall the formula for K.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (2 pi G) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) / ( (P) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut since the orbits are circular (e=0), the denominator becomes 1. Also, since M_p << M_star (for both planets, as 5 and 7 Earth masses vs 1.5 solar masses; 1 solar mass is about 333,000 Earth masses), M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So, the formula simplifies.\n\nK \u2248 ( (2 pi G) / c )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) / ( P^(1/3) )\n\nBut for circular orbits and edge-on (i=90 degrees, so sin i =1), this simplifies further.\n\nBut I don't have P for either planet, but perhaps the transit method gives the orbital period. Let me think. The transit method allows us to find the orbital period because the time between transits is the period. But the problem doesn't provide the periods. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Doppler shifts can be used to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, which is what I need for the temperature ratio.\n\nWait, because K is proportional to (M_p / a^1.5) ), since K depends on (M_p) / (a^(3/2)) ), because K is proportional to (M_p) / (a^(3/2) ) ), because from Kepler's third law, a^3 \u221d (M_star + M_p) * P^2, but since M_p << M_star, a^3 \u221d M_star * P^2. So, P is related to a^(3/2) / sqrt(M_star).\n\nWait, perhaps I should express K in terms of a.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, the orbital period P is given by:\n\nP^2 = (4 pi^2 / (G M_star)) ) * a^3\n\nSo, P = ( (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_star) )^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting P into the K equation.\n\nK = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/( P^(1/3) )) )\n\nSubstituting P from above:\n\nP^(1/3) = [ (4 pi^2 a^3)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 )\n\nSo,\n\nK = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * [ (G M_star)/(4 pi^2 a^3) ) ]^(1/6 )\n\nSimplify this expression.\n\nLet me write exponents:\n\n(2 pi G )^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) G^(1/3)\n\nM_p is as is.\n\nM_star^(2/3) in denominator.\n\nThen, the term [ G M_star / (4 pi^2 a^3) ) ]^(1/6 ) = G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) a^(-1/2) (4 pi^2)^(-1/6)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nK = [ 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) G^(1/3) ] * [ M_p ] * [ G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) a^(-1/2) (4 pi^2)^(-1/6) ) ] / [ M_star^(2/3) ) ]\n\nCombine the terms:\n\nG exponents: 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2.\n\nM_p: M_p.\n\nM_star exponents: 1/6 - 2/3 = 1/6 -4/6= -3/6 = -1/2.\n\na exponents: -1/2.\n\nConstants:\n\n2^(1/3) * (4 pi^2)^(-1/6) ) = 2^(1/3) * (2^2 pi^2)^(-1/6) ) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-1/3) pi^(-1/3) ) = pi^(-1/3)\n\npi terms: pi^(1/3) * pi^(-1/3) ) = 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nK = ( G^(1/2) M_p ) * ( a^(-1/2) ) * ( M_star^(-1/2) ) ) * ( 1 ) \n\nWait, let me check the exponents again.\n\nWait, the M_star term: 1/6 (from the numerator) and then divided by M_star^(2/3) which is M_star^(-2/3). So overall exponent is (1/6 - 2/3) = (1/6 -4/6) = (-3/6)= -1/2.\n\nSo, K = [ G^(1/2) * M_p * M_star^(-1/2) ) / a^(1/2) ) ] * [ other constants ]\n\nWait, but what's left of the constants? We had pi terms canceling, 2 terms as well.\n\nSo, K = ( M_p ) * ( sqrt(G) ) / ( sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a) ) ) * [ some constants ]\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express K as:\n\nK = ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star ) )^(1/2) * ( 1 / a )^(1/2) ) * ( 2 pi )^(1/3) ) [maybe?]\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use another approach. Let's think about the ratio of K for Planet1 and Planet2.\n\nK1 / K2 = [ (M_p1 / a1^1.5 ) / (M_p2 / a2^1.5 ) ) ] * [ (M_star2 / M_star1 )^(1/3) ) ]\n\nWait, but the stars are the same, so M_star1 = M_star2 = 1.5 solar masses. So the ratio would be (M_p1 / M_p2) * (a2 / a1 )^(1.5) )\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write the K formula again.\n\nThe correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_J) ) * ( (M_J) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1 yr) / P )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, another version I found online is:\n\nK = ( ( (G * M_p^3 * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) / ( (2 pi )^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )\n\nHmm, but perhaps a better approach is to recall that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)) )\n\nBut without knowing P, maybe I can find a relationship between a1 and a2.\n\nWait, from Kepler's third law:\n\nP^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3)/(G (M_star + M_p))\n\nSince M_p is much smaller than M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nP^2 \u2248 (4 pi^2 a^3)/(G M_star)\n\nSo, a^3 = (G M_star P^2)/(4 pi^2 )\n\nThus, a = [ ( G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo, a is proportional to (M_star^(1/3) ) * (P^(2/3) )\n\nBut I don't know P, so perhaps I can express the ratio a1/a2 in terms of K1 and K2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express K in terms of a.\n\nFrom the K formula,\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (2 pi )^(1/3) P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3)/(G M_star )\n\nSo, P = ( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting into K:\n\nK = ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (2 pi )^(1/3) ( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) )^(1/6 ) ) )\n\nWait, let's compute the denominator:\n\n(2 pi )^(1/3) * [ (4 pi^2 a^3/( G M_star )) ) ]^(1/6 )\n\n= (2 pi )^(1/3) * (4 pi^2 )^(1/6) a^(1/2) (G M_star )^(-1/6 )\n\n= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) * (4^(1/6) pi^(2/6) ) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n4^(1/6) is 2^(2/6) = 2^(1/3). So,\n\n= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6 )\n\n= 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6 )\n\nNow, the numerator in K is:\n\n( G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) )\n\nSo, K = [ (G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / M_star^(2/3) ) ] / [ 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6) ) ]\n\nSimplify the numerator and denominator:\n\n= ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / M_star^(2/3) ) * 1/( 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6) ) )\n\n= M_p^(1/3) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * G^(1/3 + 1/6 ) * 1/( 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(-1/6) )\n\nG exponents: 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2.\n\nM_star exponents: -2/3 + 1/6 = (-4/6 + 1/6 ) = (-3/6) = -1/2.\n\nSo,\n\n= M_p^(1/3) * G^(1/2) / ( 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) )\n\n= [ M_p^(1/3) G^(1/2) ] / [ 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ]\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps I can express a in terms of K.\n\nAlternatively, let's rearrange for a.\n\na^(1/2) = [ M_p^(1/3) G^(1/2) ] / ( 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) K M_star^(1/2) ) )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\na = [ M_p^(2/3) G ] / ( 2^(4/3) pi^(4/3) K^2 M_star )\n\nSo,\n\na = [ (M_p^2 G ) ] / ( 2^(4/3) pi^(4/3) K^2 M_star )\n\nThus, a is proportional to (M_p^2) / ( K^2 M_star )\n\nSo, for each planet:\n\na1 \u221d (M_p1^2 ) / ( K1^2 M_star )\n\na2 \u221d (M_p2^2 ) / ( K2^2 M_star )\n\nSo, the ratio a1/a2 is [ (M_p1^2 / K1^2) ] / [ (M_p2^2 / K2^2) ] )\n\nBecause M_star is the same for both.\n\na1/a2 = (M_p1^2 / K1^2 ) * ( K2^2 / M_p2^2 )\n\n= ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^2 ) * ( (K2/K1)^2 )\n\n= ( (7 /5 )^2 ) * ( (0.04 / 0.03 )^2 )\n\nCompute this:\n\n7/5 = 1.4 \u2192 (1.4)^2 = 1.96\n\n0.04/0.03 = 4/3 \u2248 1.3333 \u2192 (4/3)^2 = 16/9 \u2248 1.7778\n\nMultiply: 1.96 * 1.7778 \u2248 3.500\n\nSo, a1/a2 \u2248 3.5\n\nThus, a1 = 3.5 a2\n\nBut wait, I'm getting a1/a2 as approximately 3.5. So, a1 is larger than a2.\n\nBut equilibrium temperature depends on sqrt(R_star/(2a)), so T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).\n\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause:\n\nT_eq \u221d sqrt( R_star/(2a) )\n\nSo,\n\n(T_eq1)/(T_eq2) = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) )\n\nSince a1/a2 = 3.5 \u2192 a2/a1 = 1/3.5 \u2248 0.2857\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(0.2857) \u2248 0.5345\n\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq2 \u2248 0.5345 \u2192 approximately 0.53\n\nSo, the ratio is about 0.53, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{eq}} = T_{\\text{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a}} \\left(1 - A\\right)^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\(T_{\\text{star}}\\) is the star's effective temperature,\n- \\(R_{\\text{star}}\\) is the star's radius,\n- \\(a\\) is the planet's orbital distance,\n- \\(A\\) is the planet's albedo.\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo (\\(A\\)), the \\((1 - A)^{1/4}\\) term cancels out when taking the ratio of equilibrium temperatures. Thus, the ratio depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude formula. The RV semi-amplitude \\(K\\) is related to the orbital distance \\(a\\), the planet's mass \\(M_p\\), and the star's mass \\(M_{\\text{star}}\\). For circular orbits and edge-on alignment (\\(i = 90^\\circ\\)), the simplified relationship is:\n\n\\[\nK \\propto \\frac{M_p}{a^{1.5}}\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\(a\\), we find:\n\n\\[\na \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2 M_{\\text{star}}}\n\\]\n\nFor Planet1 and Planet2, the ratio of their orbital distances is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{M_{p1}}{K_1}\\right)^2}{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{K_2}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n- \\(M_{p1} = 7 \\, M_{\\text{Earth}}, M_{p2} = 5 \\, M_{\\text{Earth}}\\),\n- \\(K_1 = 0.03 \\, \\text{\u00c5}, K_2 = 0.04 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\),\n\nwe calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.04}{0.03}\\right)^2 = (1.4)^2 \\cdot (1.333)^2 = 1.96 \\cdot 1.7778 \\approx 3.5\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(a_1 = 3.5 \\, a_2\\).\n\nNow, substituting into the equilibrium temperature ratio formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3.5}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.2857} \\approx 0.5345\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately \\(0.53\\), which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that factor cancels out. Good, that's one less thing to worry about.\n\nThe star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 with 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 with 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.\n\nThe question gives some data about the Doppler shifts caused by each planet. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5, and Planet2 causes a 0.04 \u00c5 shift. I think this relates to the radial velocity method, which measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The bigger the shift, the more mass the planet has, or the closer it is, I suppose.\n\nWait, but how does the radial velocity relate to the planet's mass and orbital period? The RV method gives the mass function, which depends on the planet's mass and the inclination of the orbit. But since both planets are detected using RV, I guess their orbits are edge-on, so the inclination is 90 degrees, making the mass function equal to the actual planet mass. So the RV measurements should give the actual masses, assuming edge-on orbits.\n\nBut wait, the question states that both planets are detected using both transit and RV methods. The transit method gives the radius, and RV gives the mass. So the given masses are correct.\n\nNow, back to the Doppler shifts. The amount of shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula for the Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity. So the velocity v can be found by delta_lambda = v * lambda / c. Wait, no, delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda. So v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.\n\nWait, let me think. The Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda_0, where lambda_0 is the rest wavelength. So rearranging, v = (delta_lambda / lambda_0) * c.\n\nGiven that, for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03 \u00c5, lambda_0 is 6300 \u00c5. So v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly for Planet2, delta_lambda is 0.04, so v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.\n\nBut wait, these velocities are the semi-amplitudes of the star's velocity due to the planet. The RV method gives the star's velocity semi-amplitude, K. So K is v = (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So K \u2248 ( (G M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ) )^(1/3) * something? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for K.\n\nWait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = [ (2 pi G) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p) / (M_star^(2) P) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / c )^(1/3)\n\nWait, perhaps I should just find the ratio of the velocities from the given Doppler shifts. Since the RV measurements are for each planet, and each gives a different K, I can find the ratio of their K's. Since the shifts are different, their K's are different.\n\nWait, wait, the question gives the shifts in the same line. So for each planet, when it's causing a shift, the star's velocity is K1 and K2. So the maximum shifts (0.03 and 0.04) correspond to K1 and K2 for each planet.\n\nSo the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift. So K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c, and K2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.\n\nBut wait, the units: delta lambda is in angstroms, and lambda is in angstroms. So the ratio is unitless, and multiplied by c (speed of light) to get velocity.\n\nSo, let's compute K1 and K2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the shifts are the same because the star's own spectrum is at 6300 K, but the [OI] line is at 6300 \u00c5, which is in the near-infrared I think. So the Doppler shift is calculated based on that specific line's wavelength.\n\nBut perhaps the exact wavelength isn't critical because when taking the ratio, the same lambda will cancel out. So the ratio of K1 to K2 is (0.03 / 0.04) = 3/4. So K1/K2 = 0.75.\n\nBut what determines K? The semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = (2.15e5 m/s) * (M_p sin i / M_jup) * (M_star / M_sun)^(-2/3) * (P / yr)^(-1/3)\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to consider the formula for K, which depends on the planet's mass, the period, and the star's mass.\n\nWait, since both planets are orbiting the same star, M_star is the same for both. So K is proportional to (M_p / (P)^(1/3)).\n\nWait, but wait, the formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) c) )\n\nWait, maybe another approach: for a circular orbit (e=0), and edge-on (sin i=1), the formula simplifies.\n\nK = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) c) ) ) * (2 pi)^(1/3)\n\nHmm, I might be getting a bit stuck here. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation between K and the planet's orbital period and mass.\n\nWait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K as:\n\nK = [ (27 * pi * G) / (4 c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (P)^( -1/3 )\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 [ (27 pi G) / (4 c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (P)^(-1/3 )\n\nBut the constants can be combined, so K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)).\n\nSo, K1/K2 = [ (M1 / M2) * ( (P2 / P1) )^(1/3) ) ] * (M_star same, so cancels) )\n\nWait, no, wait: K is proportional to (M_p) * (P)^(-1/3).\n\nSo, K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nWait, but I don't know the periods P1 and P2. Hmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps the RV method gives K, and the transit method gives the planet's radius, but how does that help me find the period? Because the period is the same for both planets, but wait, no, each planet has its own period.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't give any data about the periods. So how can I proceed?\n\nWait, maybe I can find the period using the Doppler shifts and the mass. Because K is related to the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's mass and the period.\n\nWait, another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital speed of the planet v_orb. Since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star's velocity is K, and the planet's velocity is v_orb = (M_star / M_p) * K. Wait, no, actually, M_star * K = M_p * v_orb, because the center of mass requires M_star * K = M_p * v_orb.\n\nSo, v_orb = (M_star / M_p) * K.\n\nBut the orbital speed v_orb is also given by v_orb = (2 pi a) / P, where a is the semi-major axis (since it's circular, a is the radius of the orbit).\n\nBut Kepler's third law says P^2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G (M_star + M_p)) ). Since M_p << M_star, P^2 \u2248 (4 pi\u00b2 a^3) / (G M_star )\n\nSo, a^3 = (G M_star P^2) / (4 pi\u00b2 )\n\nThen, v_orb = (2 pi a) / P = (2 pi) / P * ( ( G M_star P^2 / (4 pi\u00b2) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify: Let me compute a in terms of P.\n\na = [ G M_star (P/(2 pi))^2 ]^(1/3 )\n\nThen, v_orb = 2 pi a / P = 2 pi [ G M_star (P/(2 pi))^2 ]^(1/3 ) / P\n\n= 2 pi [ G M_star ]^(1/3) [ (P^2)/(4 pi\u00b2) ]^(1/3 ) / P\n\n= 2 pi [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * [ P^(2/3) ) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) ] / P\n\n= 2 pi [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * ( P^(2/3) ) / ( (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) ) * P^(-1)\n\n= 2 pi [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * ( P^(-1/3) ) / ( (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/3) )\n\n= (2 pi ) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) * [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )\n\nLet me compute (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/3 ) = (4)^(1/3) * (pi)^(2/3 )\n\nSo, (2 pi) / (4^(1/3) pi^(2/3) ) ) = (2 pi) / [ (4)^(1/3) pi^(2/3) ) ]\n\n= 2 / (4^(1/3) ) * pi^(1 - 2/3 )\n\n= 2 / (4^(1/3) ) * pi^(1/3 )\n\n4^(1/3 ) is cube root of 4 \u2248 1.5874.\n\nSo, 2 / 1.5874 \u2248 1.2599.\n\npi^(1/3 ) \u2248 1.4646.\n\nSo 1.2599 * 1.4646 \u2248 1.840.\n\nSo v_orb \u2248 1.840 * [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )\n\nBut from earlier, v_orb = (M_star / M_p ) * K.\n\nSo,\n\n(M_star / M_p ) * K = 1.840 * [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = [ 1.840 * [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * P^(-1/3 ) ] * ( M_p / M_star )\n\n= 1.840 * (G M_star )^(1/3 ) * M_p / M_star * P^(-1/3 )\n\n= 1.840 * (G )^(1/3 ) * M_p^(1) * M_star^(-2/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )\n\nWhich matches the earlier formula I had for K. So that's consistent.\n\nBut how does this help me find the ratio of the periods P1 and P2?\n\nWait, I need the ratio K1/K2 to find the ratio of the periods, perhaps.\n\nBut I know K1 and K2 from the Doppler shifts.\n\nGiven that, let me compute K1 and K2.\n\nThe shift in wavelength for Planet1 is 0.03 \u00c5, and for Planet2 it's 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nThe rest wavelength lambda0 is 6300 \u00c5.\n\nSo, for Planet1:\n\nv1 = (delta_lambda / lambda0) * c\n\n= (0.03 / 6300) * c\n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04 / 6300 ) * c.\n\nSo, K1 = (0.03/6300) * c\n\nK2 = (0.04/6300 ) * c\n\nSo, K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.\n\nBut from the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = [ (M1 / M2) * (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ) ]\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = (7/5) * (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )\n\nBecause Planet1 has M_p =7 Earth masses, Planet2 M_p=5.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = (7/5) * (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 5/7:\n\n(0.75 * 5/7 ) = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )\n\n0.75 is 3/4, so 3/4 * 5/7 = 15/(28) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo,\n\n(P2/P1 )^(1/3 ) \u2248 0.5357\n\nCube both sides:\n\nP2/P1 \u2248 (0.5357)^3 \u2248 0.153.\n\nSo,\n\nP2 = 0.153 * P1.\n\nSo, the period of Planet2 is about 0.153 times that of Planet1.\n\nWait, but I need to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature T_eq is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * ( R_star / (2 a) )^(1/2 )\n\nWhere T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is its radius, a is the planet's orbital distance.\n\nSo, the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of (R_star/(2a)), and T_star.\n\nBut since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for both. So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) ) )\n\nBecause, T_eq ~ sqrt(1/a), since T_eq = T_star * (R_star/(2 a))^(1/2 )\n\nSo, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause,\n\nT1 = T_star * sqrt( R/(2 a1) )\n\nT2 = T_star * sqrt( R/(2 a2) )\n\nSo, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo, I need to find the ratio a2/a1.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, a^3 is proportional to P^2 * M_star.\n\nWait, Kepler's law: P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star )\n\nSo, a\u00b3 = (G M_star P\u00b2) / (4 pi\u00b2 )\n\nSo, a \u221d P^(2/3) * M_star^(1/3 )\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, M_star is same, so a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3 )\n\nSo, a1/a2 = (P1/P2 )^(2/3 )\n\nBut earlier, we found P2 = 0.153 P1 \u2192 P1/P2 \u2248 6.543.\n\nWait, 1/0.153 is approximately 6.543.\n\nSo,\n\na1/a2 = (6.543 )^(2/3 )\n\nWait, 6.543 is approximately (6.543) = 6.543^(1/3) is cube root of 6.543.\n\nLet me compute 6.543^(1/3):\n\nWell, 1.8\u00b3 is 5.832, 1.9\u00b3 is 6.859. So 6.543 is between 1.8\u00b3 and 1.9\u00b3.\n\nCompute 1.85\u00b3: 1.85^3 = (1.8 + 0.05)^3.\n\nApproximating: 1.8^3 = 5.832. 3*(1.8)^2 *0.05 = 3*(3.24)*0.05= 0.486. 3*(1.8)*(0.05)^2=3*1.8*0.0025=0.0135. (0.05)^3=0.000125.\n\nSo 5.832 + 0.486 =6.318 +0.0135=6.3315 + 0.000125=6.3316. So 1.85^3 \u22486.3316.\n\nBut 6.543 is larger. 1.86^3: 1.86^3 = ?\n\nCompute 1.86 *1.86=3.4596. Then, 3.4596 *1.86.\n\n3 *1.86=5.58, 0.4596 *1.86 \u22480.853. So total \u22485.58 +0.853=6.433.\n\nSo 1.86^3\u22486.433.\n\nHmm, 6.543 is a bit higher. Let's try 1.87.\n\n1.87^3: 1.87 *1.87=3.4969. 3.4969 *1.87 \u2248 ?\n\n3 *1.87=5.61, 0.4969 *1.87 \u22480.929. So total \u22485.61+0.929=6.539. Close to 6.543.\n\nSo, 1.87^3 \u22486.539, which is very close to 6.543. So cube root of 6.543 is approximately 1.87.\n\nSo, a1/a2 = (6.543)^(2/3 ) = [ (6.543)^(1/3) ]^2 \u2248 (1.87)^2 \u22483.4969.\n\nSo, a1/a2 \u22483.4969.\n\nSo, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/3.4969 ) \u2248 sqrt(0.286 ) \u22480.535.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 \u22480.535.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close to this.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, the Doppler shifts gave K1 and K2. Then, using K1/K2=0.75 = (M1/M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nWhich gives (P2/P1)^(1/3 ) = (0.75 * M2)/(M1 )\n\nBecause, 0.75 = (7/5) * (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\n(P2/P1 )^(1/3 ) = (0.75 *5 ) /7 = 3.75 /7 \u22480.5357.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, cube to get P2/P1= (0.5357)^3 \u22480.153.\n\nSo P1=6.543 P2.\n\nThen, from Kepler's law, a \u221d P^(2/3) M_star^(1/3 )\n\nSince M_star is same, a1/a2= (P1/P2 )^(2/3 )= (6.543 )^(2/3 )= (approx 3.4969 )\n\nSo, T_eq is proportional to sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/3.4969 )= ~0.535.\n\nSo, the ratio T1/T2 is ~0.535, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that factor cancels out. Good, that's one less thing to worry about.\n\nThe star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 with 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 with 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.\n\nThe question gives some data about the Doppler shifts caused by each planet. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5, and Planet2 causes a 0.04 \u00c5 shift. I think this relates to the radial velocity method, which measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The bigger the shift, the more mass the planet has, or the closer it is, I suppose.\n\nWait, but how does the radial velocity relate to the planet's mass and orbital period? The RV method gives the mass function, which depends on the planet's mass and the inclination of the orbit. But since both planets are detected using RV, I guess their orbits are edge-on, so the inclination is 90 degrees, making the mass function equal to the actual planet mass. So the RV measurements should give the actual masses, assuming edge-on orbits.\n\nBut wait, the question states that both planets are detected using both transit and RV methods. The transit method gives the radius, and RV gives the mass. So the given masses are correct.\n\nNow, back to the Doppler shifts. The amount of shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula for the Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity. So the velocity v can be found by delta_lambda = v * lambda / c. Wait, no, delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda. So v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.\n\nWait, let me think. The Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda_0, where lambda_0 is the rest wavelength. So rearranging, v = (delta_lambda / lambda_0) * c.\n\nGiven that, for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03 \u00c5, lambda_0 is 6300 \u00c5. So v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly for Planet2, delta_lambda is 0.04, so v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.\n\nBut wait, these velocities are the semi-amplitudes of the star's velocity due to the planet. The RV method gives the star's velocity semi-amplitude, K. So K is v = (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So K \u2248 ( (G M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ) )^(1/3) * something? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for K.\n\nWait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = [ (2 pi G) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p) / (M_star^(2) P) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / c )^(1/3)\n\nWait, perhaps I should just find the ratio of the velocities from the given Doppler shifts. Since the RV measurements are for each planet, and each gives a different K, I can find the ratio of their K's. Since the shifts are different, their K's are different.\n\nWait, wait, the question gives the shifts in the same line. So for each planet, when it's causing a shift, the star's velocity is K1 and K2. So the maximum shifts (0.03 and 0.04) correspond to K1 and K2 for each planet.\n\nSo the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift. So K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c, and K2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.\n\nBut wait, the units: delta lambda is in angstroms, and lambda is in angstroms. So the ratio is unitless, and multiplied by c (speed of light) to get velocity.\n\nSo, let's compute K1 and K2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the shifts are the same because the star's own spectrum is at 6300 K, but the [OI] line is at 6300 \u00c5, which is in the near-infrared I think. So the Doppler shift is calculated based on that specific line's wavelength.\n\nBut perhaps the exact wavelength isn't critical because when taking the ratio, the same lambda will cancel out. So the ratio of K1 to K2 is (0.03 / 0.04) = 3/4. So K1/K2 = 0.75.\n\nBut what determines K? The semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = (2.15e5 m/s) * (M_p sin i / M_jup) * (M_star / M_sun)^(-2/3) * (P / yr)^(-1/3)\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to consider the formula for K, which depends on the planet's mass, the period, and the star's mass.\n\nWait, since both planets are orbiting the same star, M_star is the same for both. So K is proportional to (M_p / (P)^(1/3)).\n\nWait, but wait, the formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) c) )\n\nWait, maybe another approach: for a circular orbit (e=0), and edge-on (sin i=1), the formula simplifies.\n\nK = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) c) ) ) * (2 pi)^(1/3)\n\nHmm, I might be getting a bit stuck here. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation between K and the planet's orbital period and mass.\n\nWait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K as:\n\nK = [ (27 * pi * G) / (4 c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (P)^( -1/3 )\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 [ (27 pi G) / (4 c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (P)^(-1/3 )\n\nBut the constants can be combined, so K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)).\n\nSo, K1/K2 = [ (M1 / M2) * ( (P2 / P1) )^(1/3) ) ] * (M_star same, so cancels) )\n\nWait, no, wait: K is proportional to (M_p) * (P)^(-1/3).\n\nSo, K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nWait, but I don't know the periods P1 and P2. Hmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps the RV method gives K, and the transit method gives the planet's radius, but how does that help me find the period? Because the period is the same for both planets, but wait, no, each planet has its own period.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't give any data about the periods. So how can I proceed?\n\nWait, maybe I can find the period using the Doppler shifts and the mass. Because K is related to the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's mass and the period.\n\nWait, another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital speed of the planet v_orb. Since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star's velocity is K, and the planet's velocity is v_orb = (M_star / M_p) * K. Wait, no, actually, M_star * K = M_p * v_orb, because the center of mass requires M_star * K = M_p * v_orb.\n\nSo, v_orb = (M_star / M_p) * K.\n\nBut the orbital speed v_orb is also given by v_orb = (2 pi a) / P, where a is the semi-major axis (since it's circular, a is the radius of the orbit).\n\nBut Kepler's third law says P^2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G (M_star + M_p)) ). Since M_p << M_star, P^2 \u2248 (4 pi\u00b2 a^3) / (G M_star )\n\nSo, a^3 = (G M_star P^2) / (4 pi\u00b2 )\n\nThen, v_orb = (2 pi a) / P = (2 pi) / P * ( ( G M_star P^2 / (4 pi\u00b2) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify: Let me compute a in terms of P.\n\na = [ G M_star (P/(2 pi))^2 ]^(1/3 )\n\nThen, v_orb = 2 pi a / P = 2 pi [ G M_star (P/(2 pi))^2 ]^(1/3 ) / P\n\n= 2 pi [ G M_star ]^(1/3) [ (P^2)/(4 pi\u00b2) ]^(1/3 ) / P\n\n= 2 pi [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * [ P^(2/3) ) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) ] / P\n\n= 2 pi [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * ( P^(2/3) ) / ( (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) ) * P^(-1)\n\n= 2 pi [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * ( P^(-1/3) ) / ( (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/3) )\n\n= (2 pi ) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) * [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )\n\nLet me compute (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/3 ) = (4)^(1/3) * (pi)^(2/3 )\n\nSo, (2 pi) / (4^(1/3) pi^(2/3) ) ) = (2 pi) / [ (4)^(1/3) pi^(2/3) ) ]\n\n= 2 / (4^(1/3) ) * pi^(1 - 2/3 )\n\n= 2 / (4^(1/3) ) * pi^(1/3 )\n\n4^(1/3 ) is cube root of 4 \u2248 1.5874.\n\nSo, 2 / 1.5874 \u2248 1.2599.\n\npi^(1/3 ) \u2248 1.4646.\n\nSo 1.2599 * 1.4646 \u2248 1.840.\n\nSo v_orb \u2248 1.840 * [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )\n\nBut from earlier, v_orb = (M_star / M_p ) * K.\n\nSo,\n\n(M_star / M_p ) * K = 1.840 * [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = [ 1.840 * [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * P^(-1/3 ) ] * ( M_p / M_star )\n\n= 1.840 * (G M_star )^(1/3 ) * M_p / M_star * P^(-1/3 )\n\n= 1.840 * (G )^(1/3 ) * M_p^(1) * M_star^(-2/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )\n\nWhich matches the earlier formula I had for K. So that's consistent.\n\nBut how does this help me find the ratio of the periods P1 and P2?\n\nWait, I need the ratio K1/K2 to find the ratio of the periods, perhaps.\n\nBut I know K1 and K2 from the Doppler shifts.\n\nGiven that, let me compute K1 and K2.\n\nThe shift in wavelength for Planet1 is 0.03 \u00c5, and for Planet2 it's 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nThe rest wavelength lambda0 is 6300 \u00c5.\n\nSo, for Planet1:\n\nv1 = (delta_lambda / lambda0) * c\n\n= (0.03 / 6300) * c\n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04 / 6300 ) * c.\n\nSo, K1 = (0.03/6300) * c\n\nK2 = (0.04/6300 ) * c\n\nSo, K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.\n\nBut from the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = [ (M1 / M2) * (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ) ]\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = (7/5) * (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )\n\nBecause Planet1 has M_p =7 Earth masses, Planet2 M_p=5.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = (7/5) * (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 5/7:\n\n(0.75 * 5/7 ) = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )\n\n0.75 is 3/4, so 3/4 * 5/7 = 15/(28) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo,\n\n(P2/P1 )^(1/3 ) \u2248 0.5357\n\nCube both sides:\n\nP2/P1 \u2248 (0.5357)^3 \u2248 0.153.\n\nSo,\n\nP2 = 0.153 * P1.\n\nSo, the period of Planet2 is about 0.153 times that of Planet1.\n\nWait, but I need to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature T_eq is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * ( R_star / (2 a) )^(1/2 )\n\nWhere T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is its radius, a is the planet's orbital distance.\n\nSo, the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of (R_star/(2a)), and T_star.\n\nBut since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for both. So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) ) )\n\nBecause, T_eq ~ sqrt(1/a), since T_eq = T_star * (R_star/(2 a))^(1/2 )\n\nSo, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause,\n\nT1 = T_star * sqrt( R/(2 a1) )\n\nT2 = T_star * sqrt( R/(2 a2) )\n\nSo, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo, I need to find the ratio a2/a1.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, a^3 is proportional to P^2 * M_star.\n\nWait, Kepler's law: P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star )\n\nSo, a\u00b3 = (G M_star P\u00b2) / (4 pi\u00b2 )\n\nSo, a \u221d P^(2/3) * M_star^(1/3 )\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, M_star is same, so a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3 )\n\nSo, a1/a2 = (P1/P2 )^(2/3 )\n\nBut earlier, we found P2 = 0.153 P1 \u2192 P1/P2 \u2248 6.543.\n\nWait, 1/0.153 is approximately 6.543.\n\nSo,\n\na1/a2 = (6.543 )^(2/3 )\n\nWait, 6.543 is approximately (6.543) = 6.543^(1/3) is cube root of 6.543.\n\nLet me compute 6.543^(1/3):\n\nWell, 1.8\u00b3 is 5.832, 1.9\u00b3 is 6.859. So 6.543 is between 1.8\u00b3 and 1.9\u00b3.\n\nCompute 1.85\u00b3: 1.85^3 = (1.8 + 0.05)^3.\n\nApproximating: 1.8^3 = 5.832. 3*(1.8)^2 *0.05 = 3*(3.24)*0.05= 0.486. 3*(1.8)*(0.05)^2=3*1.8*0.0025=0.0135. (0.05)^3=0.000125.\n\nSo 5.832 + 0.486 =6.318 +0.0135=6.3315 + 0.000125=6.3316. So 1.85^3 \u22486.3316.\n\nBut 6.543 is larger. 1.86^3: 1.86^3 = ?\n\nCompute 1.86 *1.86=3.4596. Then, 3.4596 *1.86.\n\n3 *1.86=5.58, 0.4596 *1.86 \u22480.853. So total \u22485.58 +0.853=6.433.\n\nSo 1.86^3\u22486.433.\n\nHmm, 6.543 is a bit higher. Let's try 1.87.\n\n1.87^3: 1.87 *1.87=3.4969. 3.4969 *1.87 \u2248 ?\n\n3 *1.87=5.61, 0.4969 *1.87 \u22480.929. So total \u22485.61+0.929=6.539. Close to 6.543.\n\nSo, 1.87^3 \u22486.539, which is very close to 6.543. So cube root of 6.543 is approximately 1.87.\n\nSo, a1/a2 = (6.543)^(2/3 ) = [ (6.543)^(1/3) ]^2 \u2248 (1.87)^2 \u22483.4969.\n\nSo, a1/a2 \u22483.4969.\n\nSo, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/3.4969 ) \u2248 sqrt(0.286 ) \u22480.535.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 \u22480.535.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close to this.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, the Doppler shifts gave K1 and K2. Then, using K1/K2=0.75 = (M1/M2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nWhich gives (P2/P1)^(1/3 ) = (0.75 * M2)/(M1 )\n\nBecause, 0.75 = (7/5) * (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\n(P2/P1 )^(1/3 ) = (0.75 *5 ) /7 = 3.75 /7 \u22480.5357.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, cube to get P2/P1= (0.5357)^3 \u22480.153.\n\nSo P1=6.543 P2.\n\nThen, from Kepler's law, a \u221d P^(2/3) M_star^(1/3 )\n\nSince M_star is same, a1/a2= (P1/P2 )^(2/3 )= (6.543 )^(2/3 )= (approx 3.4969 )\n\nSo, T_eq is proportional to sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/3.4969 )= ~0.535.\n\nSo, the ratio T1/T2 is ~0.535, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by analyzing the given data. The equilibrium temperature \\( T_{\\text{eq}} \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{eq}} = T_{\\text{star}} \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( T_{\\text{star}} \\) is the star's effective temperature, \\( R_{\\text{star}} \\) is the star's radius, and \\( a \\) is the planet's orbital distance. Since both planets orbit the same star, \\( T_{\\text{star}} \\) and \\( R_{\\text{star}} \\) are constant, and the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, \\( a^3 \\propto P^2 M_{\\text{star}} \\). Since both planets orbit the same star, \\( M_{\\text{star}} \\) is constant, and \\( a \\propto P^{2/3} \\). Thus, the ratio of orbital distances is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{2/3}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_2 \\), we use the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude \\( K \\) is proportional to \\( \\frac{M_p}{P^{1/3}} \\), where \\( M_p \\) is the planet's mass and \\( P \\) is its orbital period. The given Doppler shifts allow us to calculate the ratio of \\( K_1 \\) and \\( K_2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75\n\\]\n\nUsing the formula for \\( K \\), we relate the periods:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{M_1}{M_2} \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( M_1 = 7 \\, M_{\\text{Earth}} \\) and \\( M_2 = 5 \\, M_{\\text{Earth}} \\):\n\n\\[\n0.75 = \\frac{7}{5} \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{0.75 \\cdot 5}{7} \\approx 0.5357\n\\]\n\nCubing both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx (0.5357)^3 \\approx 0.153\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.153} \\approx 6.543\n\\]\n\nNow, using \\( a \\propto P^{2/3} \\), the ratio of orbital distances is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{2/3} \\approx (6.543)^{2/3}\n\\]\n\nApproximating \\( 6.543^{1/3} \\approx 1.87 \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1}{a_2} \\approx (1.87)^2 \\approx 3.4969\n\\]\n\nFinally, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3.4969}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.286} \\approx 0.535\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. \n\nAlright, two planets are orbiting a star, and they've been detected using both the transit and radial velocity methods. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. \n\nThe planets: Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. \n\nThey talk about the Doppler shifts from each planet on the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. Planet1 causes a shift up to 0.03 \u00c5, and Planet2 up to 0.04 \u00c5. But I'm not sure how this relates to the question yet. Oh, wait, the question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. \n\nEquilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo. So the albedo factor will cancel out in the ratio. So I don't need to worry about that. \n\nBut to find the ratio T1/T2, I need to find each planet's equilibrium temperature and then take the ratio. \n\nSo, the formula: T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) \n\nSince a is the same for both planets? Wait no, each planet has its own semi-major axis. Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't give the semi-major axes. Hmm. So how do I find the semi-major axis for each planet?\n\nWait, the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis. Because the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the planet's mass and the distance from the star. \n\nWait, but the problem gives the Doppler shifts (in \u00c5) for each planet. So perhaps I can find the velocity semi-amplitude for each, then relate that to the semi-major axis. \n\nThe Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = [ (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^0.5 * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2\u03c0))^(1/3) * ( (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(1/3) ) \n\nWait, maybe I should think about the Doppler shift formula. The Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is approximately v/c, where v is the velocity along the line of sight. So the shift given (like 0.03 \u00c5) can be converted into velocity. \n\nThe star's rest wavelength is 6300 \u00c5. So the shift is 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1. The fractional shift is 0.03 / 6300 = approximately 4.76e-6. \n\nSince v = c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb), and for small velocities, v \u2248 c*(\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb). So for Planet1, v = 3e8 m/s * (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) \n\nWait, let me compute that. \n\n0.03 \u00c5 is 0.03e-10 meters. 6300 \u00c5 is 6300e-10 meters. \n\nSo the fractional shift is 0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-5 / 6300? Wait, no: 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-5 / 6300? Wait, 0.03 is 3e-2, so 3e-2 / 6300 = 3/(6300 * 100) ) = 3/(630000) ) = 1e-5 approx. \n\nWait, 0.03 /6300 = 0.03 / 6.3e3 = 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = (3/6.3) * 1e-5 = approx 0.476e-5 = 4.76e-6. \n\nSo the velocity is v = c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) = 3e8 m/s * 4.76e-6 \u2248 1.428e3 m/s. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 3e8 m/s times 4.76e-6 is 3e8 *4.76e-6 = 1.428e3 m/s, which is 1428 m/s. That seems high for a planet's induced velocity, but maybe it's correct. \n\nWait, but that's the star's velocity. So the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is 1428 m/s for Planet1. Similarly, for Planet2, the shift is 0.04 \u00c5, so the same approach. \n\n0.04 /6300 = 4e-5 /6300? Wait, 0.04 /6300 = 4e-2 /6.3e3 = (4/6.3) * 1e-5 = approx 0.635e-5. So 6.35e-6. \n\nv = 3e8 * 6.35e-6 \u2248 1.905e3 m/s. So K2 is about 1905 m/s. \n\nSo K1 is 1428 m/s, K2 is 1905 m/s. \n\nNow, the RV formula for K is given by:\n\nK = [ ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1/(2\u03c0))^(1/3) )\n\nBut since the orbits are circular, e=0, so (1 - e\u00b2)^0.5 is 1. Also, sin i is 1 because the transit method was used, which implies that the orbit is edge-on (i=90 degrees), so sin i =1. \n\nSo, K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2\u03c0))^(1/3) )^(1/3) ) Wait, maybe I should write it correctly. \n\nThe formula I remember is:\n\nK = [ (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) ) ] * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi))^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe I should look up the correct formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the expression:\n\nK = (v) = ( (2 pi G ) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps I should express K in terms of the orbital period P and other variables. But maybe another approach is better. \n\nAlternatively, the formula can be expressed as:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi))^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to write the equation in terms of K, M_p, M_star, and P. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between K and the semi-major axis a. \n\nThe formula for the semi-major axis a is:\n\na^3 = ( G (M_star + M_p) P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )\n\nBut since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. \n\nSo a^3 = ( G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )\n\nBut I don't have the period P. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (2 pi G ) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut without knowing P, this might not help. \n\nWait, but perhaps I can relate K to the mass and the semi-major axis. Let me think. \n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi))^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 - e^2))^(1/2) * (1 / (a (1 + M_p / M_star )^(1/3) ) )\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the formula for K. \n\nThe correct formula for K is:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi))^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nK = [ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( (1 - e^2 )^(-1/2) ) ) * ( sin i ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2 pi )^(-1) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe I should find a more straightforward way. Let me look for a simplified version.\n\nAfter some research, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3) )\n\nBut since e=0 and sin i=1, this simplifies to:\n\nK = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe another way. Let me think about the star's velocity. The star's velocity is related to the planet's orbit. The star's velocity (v_star) is given by v = (2 pi a_star) / P, where a_star is the star's orbit around the barycenter. \n\nThe semi-major axis of the star's orbit, a_star, is given by (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) ) * a, where a is the planet's semi-major axis. \n\nSo, a_star = (M_p / (M_star + M_p )) a \n\nThe star's velocity is then v = 2 pi a_star / P \n\nBut we also know that the planet's orbital period P is given by Kepler's third law: \n\nP^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 ) / ( G (M_star + M_p ) )\n\nSo, substituting a from Kepler's law into a_star:\n\na = [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\na_star = (M_p / (M_star + M_p )) * [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo, v = 2 pi a_star / P = 2 pi / P * [ M_p / (M_star + M_p ) ) ] * [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nv = (2 pi / P) * (M_p / (M_star + M_p )) * [ G (M_star + M_p )^(1) P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me cube both sides to make it easier:\n\nv^3 = [ (2 pi / P )^3 * (M_p^3 / (M_star + M_p )^3 ) * ( G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 ) ) ]\n\nSimplify the terms inside:\n\n= (8 pi^3 / P^3 ) * ( M_p^3 / (M_star + M_p )^3 ) * ( G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 ) )\n\n= (8 pi^3 * M_p^3 ) / ( P^3 (M_star + M_p )^3 ) ) * ( G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )\n\n= (8 pi^3 M_p^3 G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 P^3 (M_star + M_p )^3 ) )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n8/4 = 2, pi^3 / pi^2 = pi, M_p^3 remains, G remains, (M_star + M_p ) in numerator and (M_star + M_p )^3 in denominator gives (M_star + M_p )^(-2), P^2 / P^3 = 1/P.\n\nSo,\n\nv^3 = (2 pi M_p^3 G ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^2 P )\n\nBut we can express P from Kepler's law. From P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 ) / ( G (M_star + M_p ) ), so P = [ (4 pi^2 a^3 ) / ( G (M_star + M_p )) ) ]^(1/2 )\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to use the formula for K in terms of the star's velocity.\n\nAnother approach: the formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1 - e^2 )^(-1/2) ) ) \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nK = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut with e=0 and sin i=1, this simplifies to:\n\nK = ( G M_p / ( M_star^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi) )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should instead find the ratio of the two K's. Since both K1 and K2 are given, and since M_star is the same for both, perhaps the ratio K1/K2 can be used to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, or something else.\n\nWait, the problem gives K1 and K2 as the shifts. So K1 is 1428 m/s and K2 is 1905 m/s.\n\nWait, but actually, the shifts are 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculating K from that.\n\nWait, the Doppler shift is given by:\n\n\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v / c \n\nSo, v = c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb )\n\nGiven that the forbidden line is at 6300 \u00c5. So for Planet1, \u0394\u03bb is 0.03 \u00c5, so:\n\nv1 = (3e8 m/s) * (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) )\n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.03e-10 /6300e-10 = 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5) = approx 4.7619e-6.\n\nSo v1 = 3e8 m/s * 4.7619e-6 = 1.42857e3 m/s = 1428.57 m/s.\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2, \u0394\u03bb = 0.04 \u00c5:\n\nv2 = 3e8 * (0.04e-10 /6300e-10 ) = 3e8 * 0.04 /6300 = 3e8 * 4e-5 /6.3e3 = 3e8 * (4e-5 /6.3e3 ) \n\nWait, 4e-5 /6.3e3 = 4/(6.3e8) )? No, wait:\n\nWait, 0.04 /6300 = 4e-2 /6.3e3 = (4/6.3) * 1e-5 = approximately 0.635e-5. \n\nSo v2 = 3e8 * 6.35e-6 = 1.905e3 m/s.\n\nSo K1 = 1428.57 m/s, K2 = 1905 m/s.\n\nNow, K is related to the planet's mass and semi-major axis. The formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 - e^2) )^(1/2 )\n\nBut since e=0 and sin i=1 (transit implies edge-on, so sin i=1), the formula simplifies to:\n\nK = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi) )^(1/3 )\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_star (M_p for Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, M_star is 1.5 solar masses; 1 solar mass is about 333 Earth masses, so 1.5 * 333 \u2248 500 Earth masses. So M_p is much smaller, so M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star.\n\nSo, approximating:\n\nK \u2248 [ (G * M_p ) / (M_star^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi) )^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (G^(1/3) * M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/9) ) ) * ( (2 pi )^(-1/3) )\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to take the ratio of K1 and K2.\n\nK1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_star2 / M_star1 )^(1/9) ) ] * [ (2 pi )^(-1/3) / (2 pi )^(-1/3) ) ]\n\nWait, but since both planets are orbiting the same star, M_star is the same. So the ratio K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3 )\n\nBecause:\n\nK = [ (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi )^(1/3) )\n\nSo K1/K2 = [ (M_p1)/(M_p2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo given K1=1428.57, K2=1905, \n\nK1/K2 = 1428.57 / 1905 \u2248 0.75.\n\nSo 0.75 = (M_p1/M_p2 )^(1/3 )\n\nCube both sides: (0.75)^3 = M_p1 / M_p2\n\n0.75^3 = (3/4)^3 = 27/64 \u2248 0.421875.\n\nBut M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses. So 7/5 = 1.4. \n\nWait, this is a discrepancy. Because according to the K ratio, M_p1/M_p2 should be 0.421875, but it's actually 1.4. So where's the mistake?\n\nAh, I think I messed up the formula. Let me re-examine the K formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nK = [ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p ) ) ) * (1/(1 - e^2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi ))^(1/3 )\n\nWait, no. Another approach: the correct formula for K is:\n\nK = [ ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi ))^(1/3 )\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should find the relation between K and the semi-major axis a.\n\nAnother approach: The velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis. The formula is:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 - e^2 )^(1/2) )\n\nAssuming e=0, sin i=1, M_p << M_star,\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / (M_star^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi )^(1/3) )\n\nSimplify:\n\nK = ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/9) (2 pi )^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to write the ratio K1/K2.\n\nK1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) ) * ( M_star2 / M_star1 )^(-1/9) ) * [ (2 pi )^(-1/3) / (2 pi )^(-1/3) ) ]\n\nBut since M_star is same for both, M_star1 = M_star2, so their ratio is 1. So:\n\nK1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3 )\n\nGiven that K1/K2 \u2248 0.75, and M_p1=7, M_p2=5,\n\n0.75 = (7/5 )^(1/3 )\n\nCompute (7/5) = 1.4. Cube root of 1.4 is about 1.12. So 0.75 \u2248 1.12? No, that's not correct. So something's wrong here. \n\nWait, maybe the formula is K proportional to (M_p / a)^(1/3) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps K is inversely proportional to a.\n\nWait, another formula I found online is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1 - e^2 )^(-1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi ))^(1/3) * (1/(a ) )\n\nWait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the star's velocity as part of the binary system.\n\nThe star and planet orbit their common barycenter. The star's velocity v_star is related to the planet's velocity v_planet by v_star = (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) v_planet.\n\nBut the planet's velocity v_planet is determined by its orbit: v_planet = 2 pi a_p / P, where a_p is the planet's semi-major axis.\n\nSimilarly, the star's velocity v_star = 2 pi a_star / P, where a_star is the star's semi-major axis around the barycenter.\n\nBut since a_p + a_star = a (the planet's semi-major axis relative to the star), and M_p a_p = M_star a_star, so a_star = (M_p / M_star ) a_p.\n\nWait, but perhaps the star's velocity is v_star = (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) ) * (2 pi a / P )\n\nBut a is the planet's semi-major axis. \n\nFrom Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M_star + M_p ) )\n\nSo, a^3 = G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 )\n\nSo a = [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSubstituting into v_star:\n\nv_star = (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * (2 pi a ) / P \n\n= (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * [ 2 pi * ( G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 ) )^(1/3 ) ) ] / P \n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nLet me write a in terms of P and M_star:\n\na = [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nv_star = (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * [ 2 pi * [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 ) ] / P \n\n= (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * [ 2 pi / (4 pi^2 )^(1/3) ) ] * [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ]^(1/3 ) / P \n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n(2 pi ) / (4 pi^2 )^(1/3 ) = (2 pi ) / ( (4)^(1/3) (pi^2 )^(1/3) ) ) \n\n= (2 pi ) / ( (2^2 )^(1/3) pi^(2/3) ) )\n\n= 2 pi / ( 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) )\n\n= 2^(1 - 2/3) pi^(1 - 2/3 )\n\n= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nv_star = (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 ) * [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ]^(1/3 ) / P \n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n[ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ]^(1/3 ) = G^(1/3) (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) P^(2/3 )\n\nDivide by P: P^(2/3) / P = P^(-1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nv_star = (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 ) * G^(1/3) (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) P^(-1/3 )\n\nThe (M_star + M_p ) terms:\n\n(M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * (M_star + M_p )^(1/3 ) = M_p (M_star + M_p )^(-2/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nv_star = M_p * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 ) G^(1/3) (M_star + M_p )^(-2/3 ) P^(-1/3 )\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, (M_star + M_p ) \u2248 M_star, so:\n\nv_star \u2248 M_p * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 ) G^(1/3) M_star^(-2/3 ) P^(-1/3 )\n\nBut we can express P in terms of a using Kepler's law. From P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star )\n\nSo P = [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ]^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting into v_star:\n\nv_star \u2248 M_p * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 ) G^(1/3) M_star^(-2/3 ) [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ) ]^(-1/6 )\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n[ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ) ]^(-1/6 ) = [4 pi^2 a^3 / (G M_star) ]^(-1/6 ) \n\n= 4^(-1/6) pi^(-2/6) a^(-3/6) G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6 )\n\n= 2^(-1/3) pi^(-1/3) a^(-1/2) G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6 )\n\nSo,\n\nv_star \u2248 M_p * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 ) G^(1/3) M_star^(-2/3 ) * 2^(-1/3) pi^(-1/3 ) a^(-1/2) G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6 )\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n2^(1/3 - 1/3 ) = 2^0 = 1\n\npi^(1/3 -1/3 ) = pi^0 =1\n\nG: (1/3 + 1/6 ) = 1/2 \u2192 G^(1/2 )\n\nM_star: (-2/3 + 1/6 ) = (-4/6 +1/6 )= (-3/6 )= -1/2 \u2192 M_star^(-1/2 )\n\na: a^(-1/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nv_star \u2248 M_p * G^(1/2 ) M_star^(-1/2 ) a^(-1/2 )\n\nBut G^(1/2 ) M_star^(-1/2 ) = sqrt( G / M_star )\n\nSo,\n\nv_star = M_p * sqrt( G / M_star ) * (1/ sqrt( a ) )\n\nBut v_star is K, the semi-amplitude. So,\n\nK = M_p * sqrt( G / (M_star a ) )\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because units-wise, M_p is mass, G has units of m^3 kg^-1 s^-2, M_star is kg, a is meters.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct expression is:\n\nK = [ (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi ) )^(1/3 )\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of Kepler's law and the relation between K and a.\n\nWait, from the expression above, K = v_star = (M_p / (M_star + M_p )) * (2 pi a / P )\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M_star + M_p ) )\n\nSo,\n\nP = (4 pi^2 a^3 / ( G (M_star + M_p ) )) )^(1/2 )\n\nSubstitute into K:\n\nK = (M_p / (M_star + M_p )) * (2 pi a ) / [ (4 pi^2 a^3 / ( G (M_star + M_p ) ))^(1/2 ) ]\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n(4 pi^2 a^3 / ( G M_star )) )^(1/2 ) = sqrt(4 pi^2 a^3 ) / sqrt( G M_star )\n\n= 2 pi a^(3/2 ) / ( sqrt( G M_star ) )\n\nSo,\n\nK = (M_p / (M_star + M_p )) * (2 pi a ) * ( sqrt( G M_star ) ) / ( 2 pi a^(3/2 ) ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 pi cancels out.\n\na / a^(3/2 ) = a^(-1/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nK = (M_p / (M_star + M_p )) * sqrt( G M_star ) / a^(1/2 )\n\nAgain, since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star.\n\nSo,\n\nK \u2248 (M_p / M_star ) * sqrt( G M_star ) / sqrt( a )\n\n= M_p sqrt( G ) / ( sqrt( M_star a ) )\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio a1/a2 from K1 and K2.\n\nSince K is proportional to (M_p / a )^(1/2 ), because from the above, K \u2248 (M_p / M_star ) * sqrt( G M_star ) / sqrt(a )\n\nWait, let me write:\n\nK = ( M_p sqrt( G ) ) / ( sqrt( M_star a ) )\n\nSo,\n\nK = ( sqrt( G ) ) * M_p / sqrt( M_star a )\n\nTherefore, K is proportional to M_p / sqrt( a )\n\nSo, K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / sqrt( a1 ) ) / ( M_p2 / sqrt( a2 ) ) )\n\n= ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBut we can solve for a1/a2.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nK1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( a2/a1 ) = (K1/K2) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\na2/a1 = ( K1^2 / K2^2 ) * ( M_p2^2 / M_p1^2 )\n\nSo,\n\na1/a2 = ( K2^2 / K1^2 ) * ( M_p1^2 / M_p2^2 )\n\nGiven K1=1428.57, K2=1905, M_p1=7, M_p2=5.\n\nCompute:\n\n(K2/K1)^2 = (1905/1428.57 )^2 \u2248 (1.3333 )^2 = 1.77778.\n\n(M_p1/M_p2)^2 = (7/5 )^2 = 49/25 = 1.96.\n\nSo,\n\na1/a2 = 1.77778 * 1.96 \u2248 3.48.\n\nSo a1 is about 3.48 times a2.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit high. Let me compute it accurately.\n\nCompute K2/K1 = 1905 / 1428.57 \u2248 1.33333.\n\nSo (K2/K1)^2 \u2248 (4/3)^2 = 16/9 \u2248 1.7778.\n\n(M_p1/M_p2)^2 = (7/5)^2 = 49/25 = 1.96.\n\nMultiply them: 1.7778 * 1.96 = let's calculate 1.7778 * 2 = 3.5556, subtract 1.7778 * 0.04=0.07111, so 3.5556 -0.07111=3.4845.\n\nSo a1/a2 \u22483.4845.\n\nSo a1 = 3.4845 a2.\n\nSo, the semi-major axes are in a ratio of a1/a2 \u22483.48.\n\nBut wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nSince albedo is same for both, (1 - albedo) factor cancels out when taking the ratio.\n\nSo,\n\nT1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) terms.\n\nWait, wait, let me write the formula correctly.\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 )\n\nSo,\n\nT1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) )\n\nT2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) )\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2 = sqrt( ( R_star/(2 a1) ) / ( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) )\n\n= sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\n= 1 / sqrt( a1/a2 )\n\nWe have a1/a2 \u22483.4845, so sqrt(3.4845 )\u2248 1.866.\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2 = 1 / 1.866 \u22480.535.\n\nSo the ratio is approximately 0.535, which is close to option C, 0.53.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because I have a1/a2 = ~3.4845, so T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/3.4845 ) \u2248 sqrt(0.2868 ) \u22480.535.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is about 0.535 times that of Planet2. So the ratio T1/T2 is ~0.53, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. \n\nAlright, two planets are orbiting a star, and they've been detected using both the transit and radial velocity methods. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. \n\nThe planets: Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. \n\nThey talk about the Doppler shifts from each planet on the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. Planet1 causes a shift up to 0.03 \u00c5, and Planet2 up to 0.04 \u00c5. But I'm not sure how this relates to the question yet. Oh, wait, the question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. \n\nEquilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo. So the albedo factor will cancel out in the ratio. So I don't need to worry about that. \n\nBut to find the ratio T1/T2, I need to find each planet's equilibrium temperature and then take the ratio. \n\nSo, the formula: T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) \n\nSince a is the same for both planets? Wait no, each planet has its own semi-major axis. Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't give the semi-major axes. Hmm. So how do I find the semi-major axis for each planet?\n\nWait, the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis. Because the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the planet's mass and the distance from the star. \n\nWait, but the problem gives the Doppler shifts (in \u00c5) for each planet. So perhaps I can find the velocity semi-amplitude for each, then relate that to the semi-major axis. \n\nThe Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = [ (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^0.5 * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2\u03c0))^(1/3) * ( (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(1/3) ) \n\nWait, maybe I should think about the Doppler shift formula. The Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is approximately v/c, where v is the velocity along the line of sight. So the shift given (like 0.03 \u00c5) can be converted into velocity. \n\nThe star's rest wavelength is 6300 \u00c5. So the shift is 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1. The fractional shift is 0.03 / 6300 = approximately 4.76e-6. \n\nSince v = c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb), and for small velocities, v \u2248 c*(\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb). So for Planet1, v = 3e8 m/s * (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) \n\nWait, let me compute that. \n\n0.03 \u00c5 is 0.03e-10 meters. 6300 \u00c5 is 6300e-10 meters. \n\nSo the fractional shift is 0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-5 / 6300? Wait, no: 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-5 / 6300? Wait, 0.03 is 3e-2, so 3e-2 / 6300 = 3/(6300 * 100) ) = 3/(630000) ) = 1e-5 approx. \n\nWait, 0.03 /6300 = 0.03 / 6.3e3 = 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = (3/6.3) * 1e-5 = approx 0.476e-5 = 4.76e-6. \n\nSo the velocity is v = c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) = 3e8 m/s * 4.76e-6 \u2248 1.428e3 m/s. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 3e8 m/s times 4.76e-6 is 3e8 *4.76e-6 = 1.428e3 m/s, which is 1428 m/s. That seems high for a planet's induced velocity, but maybe it's correct. \n\nWait, but that's the star's velocity. So the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is 1428 m/s for Planet1. Similarly, for Planet2, the shift is 0.04 \u00c5, so the same approach. \n\n0.04 /6300 = 4e-5 /6300? Wait, 0.04 /6300 = 4e-2 /6.3e3 = (4/6.3) * 1e-5 = approx 0.635e-5. So 6.35e-6. \n\nv = 3e8 * 6.35e-6 \u2248 1.905e3 m/s. So K2 is about 1905 m/s. \n\nSo K1 is 1428 m/s, K2 is 1905 m/s. \n\nNow, the RV formula for K is given by:\n\nK = [ ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1/(2\u03c0))^(1/3) )\n\nBut since the orbits are circular, e=0, so (1 - e\u00b2)^0.5 is 1. Also, sin i is 1 because the transit method was used, which implies that the orbit is edge-on (i=90 degrees), so sin i =1. \n\nSo, K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2\u03c0))^(1/3) )^(1/3) ) Wait, maybe I should write it correctly. \n\nThe formula I remember is:\n\nK = [ (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) ) ] * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi))^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe I should look up the correct formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the expression:\n\nK = (v) = ( (2 pi G ) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps I should express K in terms of the orbital period P and other variables. But maybe another approach is better. \n\nAlternatively, the formula can be expressed as:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi))^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to write the equation in terms of K, M_p, M_star, and P. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between K and the semi-major axis a. \n\nThe formula for the semi-major axis a is:\n\na^3 = ( G (M_star + M_p) P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )\n\nBut since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. \n\nSo a^3 = ( G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )\n\nBut I don't have the period P. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (2 pi G ) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut without knowing P, this might not help. \n\nWait, but perhaps I can relate K to the mass and the semi-major axis. Let me think. \n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi))^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 - e^2))^(1/2) * (1 / (a (1 + M_p / M_star )^(1/3) ) )\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the formula for K. \n\nThe correct formula for K is:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi))^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nK = [ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( (1 - e^2 )^(-1/2) ) ) * ( sin i ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2 pi )^(-1) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe I should find a more straightforward way. Let me look for a simplified version.\n\nAfter some research, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3) )\n\nBut since e=0 and sin i=1, this simplifies to:\n\nK = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe another way. Let me think about the star's velocity. The star's velocity is related to the planet's orbit. The star's velocity (v_star) is given by v = (2 pi a_star) / P, where a_star is the star's orbit around the barycenter. \n\nThe semi-major axis of the star's orbit, a_star, is given by (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) ) * a, where a is the planet's semi-major axis. \n\nSo, a_star = (M_p / (M_star + M_p )) a \n\nThe star's velocity is then v = 2 pi a_star / P \n\nBut we also know that the planet's orbital period P is given by Kepler's third law: \n\nP^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 ) / ( G (M_star + M_p ) )\n\nSo, substituting a from Kepler's law into a_star:\n\na = [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\na_star = (M_p / (M_star + M_p )) * [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo, v = 2 pi a_star / P = 2 pi / P * [ M_p / (M_star + M_p ) ) ] * [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nv = (2 pi / P) * (M_p / (M_star + M_p )) * [ G (M_star + M_p )^(1) P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me cube both sides to make it easier:\n\nv^3 = [ (2 pi / P )^3 * (M_p^3 / (M_star + M_p )^3 ) * ( G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 ) ) ]\n\nSimplify the terms inside:\n\n= (8 pi^3 / P^3 ) * ( M_p^3 / (M_star + M_p )^3 ) * ( G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 ) )\n\n= (8 pi^3 * M_p^3 ) / ( P^3 (M_star + M_p )^3 ) ) * ( G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )\n\n= (8 pi^3 M_p^3 G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 P^3 (M_star + M_p )^3 ) )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n8/4 = 2, pi^3 / pi^2 = pi, M_p^3 remains, G remains, (M_star + M_p ) in numerator and (M_star + M_p )^3 in denominator gives (M_star + M_p )^(-2), P^2 / P^3 = 1/P.\n\nSo,\n\nv^3 = (2 pi M_p^3 G ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^2 P )\n\nBut we can express P from Kepler's law. From P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 ) / ( G (M_star + M_p ) ), so P = [ (4 pi^2 a^3 ) / ( G (M_star + M_p )) ) ]^(1/2 )\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to use the formula for K in terms of the star's velocity.\n\nAnother approach: the formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1 - e^2 )^(-1/2) ) ) \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nK = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut with e=0 and sin i=1, this simplifies to:\n\nK = ( G M_p / ( M_star^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi) )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should instead find the ratio of the two K's. Since both K1 and K2 are given, and since M_star is the same for both, perhaps the ratio K1/K2 can be used to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, or something else.\n\nWait, the problem gives K1 and K2 as the shifts. So K1 is 1428 m/s and K2 is 1905 m/s.\n\nWait, but actually, the shifts are 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculating K from that.\n\nWait, the Doppler shift is given by:\n\n\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v / c \n\nSo, v = c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb )\n\nGiven that the forbidden line is at 6300 \u00c5. So for Planet1, \u0394\u03bb is 0.03 \u00c5, so:\n\nv1 = (3e8 m/s) * (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) )\n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.03e-10 /6300e-10 = 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5) = approx 4.7619e-6.\n\nSo v1 = 3e8 m/s * 4.7619e-6 = 1.42857e3 m/s = 1428.57 m/s.\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2, \u0394\u03bb = 0.04 \u00c5:\n\nv2 = 3e8 * (0.04e-10 /6300e-10 ) = 3e8 * 0.04 /6300 = 3e8 * 4e-5 /6.3e3 = 3e8 * (4e-5 /6.3e3 ) \n\nWait, 4e-5 /6.3e3 = 4/(6.3e8) )? No, wait:\n\nWait, 0.04 /6300 = 4e-2 /6.3e3 = (4/6.3) * 1e-5 = approximately 0.635e-5. \n\nSo v2 = 3e8 * 6.35e-6 = 1.905e3 m/s.\n\nSo K1 = 1428.57 m/s, K2 = 1905 m/s.\n\nNow, K is related to the planet's mass and semi-major axis. The formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 - e^2) )^(1/2 )\n\nBut since e=0 and sin i=1 (transit implies edge-on, so sin i=1), the formula simplifies to:\n\nK = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi) )^(1/3 )\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_star (M_p for Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, M_star is 1.5 solar masses; 1 solar mass is about 333 Earth masses, so 1.5 * 333 \u2248 500 Earth masses. So M_p is much smaller, so M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star.\n\nSo, approximating:\n\nK \u2248 [ (G * M_p ) / (M_star^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi) )^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (G^(1/3) * M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/9) ) ) * ( (2 pi )^(-1/3) )\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to take the ratio of K1 and K2.\n\nK1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_star2 / M_star1 )^(1/9) ) ] * [ (2 pi )^(-1/3) / (2 pi )^(-1/3) ) ]\n\nWait, but since both planets are orbiting the same star, M_star is the same. So the ratio K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3 )\n\nBecause:\n\nK = [ (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi )^(1/3) )\n\nSo K1/K2 = [ (M_p1)/(M_p2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo given K1=1428.57, K2=1905, \n\nK1/K2 = 1428.57 / 1905 \u2248 0.75.\n\nSo 0.75 = (M_p1/M_p2 )^(1/3 )\n\nCube both sides: (0.75)^3 = M_p1 / M_p2\n\n0.75^3 = (3/4)^3 = 27/64 \u2248 0.421875.\n\nBut M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses. So 7/5 = 1.4. \n\nWait, this is a discrepancy. Because according to the K ratio, M_p1/M_p2 should be 0.421875, but it's actually 1.4. So where's the mistake?\n\nAh, I think I messed up the formula. Let me re-examine the K formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nK = [ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p ) ) ) * (1/(1 - e^2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi ))^(1/3 )\n\nWait, no. Another approach: the correct formula for K is:\n\nK = [ ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi ))^(1/3 )\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should find the relation between K and the semi-major axis a.\n\nAnother approach: The velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis. The formula is:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 - e^2 )^(1/2) )\n\nAssuming e=0, sin i=1, M_p << M_star,\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / (M_star^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi )^(1/3) )\n\nSimplify:\n\nK = ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/9) (2 pi )^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to write the ratio K1/K2.\n\nK1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) ) * ( M_star2 / M_star1 )^(-1/9) ) * [ (2 pi )^(-1/3) / (2 pi )^(-1/3) ) ]\n\nBut since M_star is same for both, M_star1 = M_star2, so their ratio is 1. So:\n\nK1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3 )\n\nGiven that K1/K2 \u2248 0.75, and M_p1=7, M_p2=5,\n\n0.75 = (7/5 )^(1/3 )\n\nCompute (7/5) = 1.4. Cube root of 1.4 is about 1.12. So 0.75 \u2248 1.12? No, that's not correct. So something's wrong here. \n\nWait, maybe the formula is K proportional to (M_p / a)^(1/3) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps K is inversely proportional to a.\n\nWait, another formula I found online is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1 - e^2 )^(-1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi ))^(1/3) * (1/(a ) )\n\nWait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the star's velocity as part of the binary system.\n\nThe star and planet orbit their common barycenter. The star's velocity v_star is related to the planet's velocity v_planet by v_star = (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) v_planet.\n\nBut the planet's velocity v_planet is determined by its orbit: v_planet = 2 pi a_p / P, where a_p is the planet's semi-major axis.\n\nSimilarly, the star's velocity v_star = 2 pi a_star / P, where a_star is the star's semi-major axis around the barycenter.\n\nBut since a_p + a_star = a (the planet's semi-major axis relative to the star), and M_p a_p = M_star a_star, so a_star = (M_p / M_star ) a_p.\n\nWait, but perhaps the star's velocity is v_star = (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) ) * (2 pi a / P )\n\nBut a is the planet's semi-major axis. \n\nFrom Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M_star + M_p ) )\n\nSo, a^3 = G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 )\n\nSo a = [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSubstituting into v_star:\n\nv_star = (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * (2 pi a ) / P \n\n= (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * [ 2 pi * ( G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 ) )^(1/3 ) ) ] / P \n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nLet me write a in terms of P and M_star:\n\na = [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nv_star = (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * [ 2 pi * [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 / (4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 ) ] / P \n\n= (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * [ 2 pi / (4 pi^2 )^(1/3) ) ] * [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ]^(1/3 ) / P \n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n(2 pi ) / (4 pi^2 )^(1/3 ) = (2 pi ) / ( (4)^(1/3) (pi^2 )^(1/3) ) ) \n\n= (2 pi ) / ( (2^2 )^(1/3) pi^(2/3) ) )\n\n= 2 pi / ( 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) )\n\n= 2^(1 - 2/3) pi^(1 - 2/3 )\n\n= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nv_star = (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 ) * [ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ]^(1/3 ) / P \n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n[ G (M_star + M_p ) P^2 ]^(1/3 ) = G^(1/3) (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) P^(2/3 )\n\nDivide by P: P^(2/3) / P = P^(-1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nv_star = (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 ) * G^(1/3) (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) P^(-1/3 )\n\nThe (M_star + M_p ) terms:\n\n(M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * (M_star + M_p )^(1/3 ) = M_p (M_star + M_p )^(-2/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nv_star = M_p * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 ) G^(1/3) (M_star + M_p )^(-2/3 ) P^(-1/3 )\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, (M_star + M_p ) \u2248 M_star, so:\n\nv_star \u2248 M_p * 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 ) G^(1/3) M_star^(-2/3 ) P^(-1/3 )\n\nBut we can express P in terms of a using Kepler's law.

Because units-wise, M_p is mass, G has units of m^3 kg^-1 s^-2, M_star is kg, a is meters.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct expression is:\n\nK = [ (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi ) )^(1/3 )\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of Kepler's law and the relation between K and a.\n\nWait, from the expression above, K = v_star = (M_p / (M_star + M_p )) * (2 pi a / P )\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M_star + M_p ) )\n\nSo,\n\nP = (4 pi^2 a^3 / ( G (M_star + M_p ) )) )^(1/2 )\n\nSubstitute into K:\n\nK = (M_p / (M_star + M_p )) * (2 pi a ) / [ (4 pi^2 a^3 / ( G (M_star + M_p ) ))^(1/2 ) ]\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n(4 pi^2 a^3 / ( G M_star )) )^(1/2 ) = sqrt(4 pi^2 a^3 ) / sqrt( G M_star )\n\n= 2 pi a^(3/2 ) / ( sqrt( G M_star ) )\n\nSo,\n\nK = (M_p / (M_star + M_p )) * (2 pi a ) * ( sqrt( G M_star ) ) / ( 2 pi a^(3/2 ) ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 pi cancels out.\n\na / a^(3/2 ) = a^(-1/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nK = (M_p / (M_star + M_p )) * sqrt( G M_star ) / a^(1/2 )\n\nAgain, since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star.\n\nSo,\n\nK \u2248 (M_p / M_star ) * sqrt( G M_star ) / sqrt( a )\n\n= M_p sqrt( G ) / ( sqrt( M_star a ) )\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio a1/a2 from K1 and K2.\n\nSince K is proportional to (M_p / a )^(1/2 ), because from the above, K \u2248 (M_p / M_star ) * sqrt( G M_star ) / sqrt(a )\n\nWait, let me write:\n\nK = ( M_p sqrt( G ) ) / ( sqrt( M_star a ) )\n\nSo,\n\nK = ( sqrt( G ) ) * M_p / sqrt( M_star a )\n\nTherefore, K is proportional to M_p / sqrt( a )\n\nSo, K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / sqrt( a1 ) ) / ( M_p2 / sqrt( a2 ) ) )\n\n= ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBut we can solve for a1/a2.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nK1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( a2/a1 ) = (K1/K2) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\na2/a1 = ( K1^2 / K2^2 ) * ( M_p2^2 / M_p1^2 )\n\nSo,\n\na1/a2 = ( K2^2 / K1^2 ) * ( M_p1^2 / M_p2^2 )\n\nGiven K1=1428.57, K2=1905, M_p1=7, M_p2=5.\n\nCompute:\n\n(K2/K1)^2 = (1905/1428.57 )^2 \u2248 (1.3333 )^2 = 1.77778.\n\n(M_p1/M_p2)^2 = (7/5 )^2 = 49/25 = 1.96.\n\nSo,\n\na1/a2 = 1.77778 * 1.96 \u2248 3.48.\n\nSo a1 is about 3.48 times a2.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit high. Let me compute it accurately.\n\nCompute K2/K1 = 1905 / 1428.57 \u2248 1.33333.\n\nSo (K2/K1)^2 \u2248 (4/3)^2 = 16/9 \u2248 1.7778.\n\n(M_p1/M_p2)^2 = (7/5)^2 = 49/25 = 1.96.\n\nMultiply them: 1.7778 * 1.96 = let's calculate 1.7778 * 2 = 3.5556, subtract 1.7778 * 0.04=0.07111, so 3.5556 -0.07111=3.4845.\n\nSo a1/a2 \u22483.4845.\n\nSo a1 = 3.4845 a2.\n\nSo, the semi-major axes are in a ratio of a1/a2 \u22483.48.\n\nBut wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nSince albedo is same for both, (1 - albedo) factor cancels out when taking the ratio.\n\nSo,\n\nT1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) terms.\n\nWait, wait, let me write the formula correctly.\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 )\n\nSo,\n\nT1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) )\n\nT2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) )\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2 = sqrt( ( R_star/(2 a1) ) / ( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) )\n\n= sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\n= 1 / sqrt( a1/a2 )\n\nWe have a1/a2 \u22483.4845, so sqrt(3.4845 )\u2248 1.866.\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2 = 1 / 1.866 \u22480.535.\n\nSo the ratio is approximately 0.535, which is close to option C, 0.53.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because I have a1/a2 = ~3.4845, so T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/3.4845 ) \u2248 sqrt(0.2868 ) \u22480.535.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is about 0.535 times that of Planet2. So the ratio T1/T2 is ~0.53, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{eq}} = T_{\\text{star}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a}} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\text{albedo}\\right)^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the albedo factor cancels out in the ratio. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(a_1/a_2\\), we use the radial velocity (RV) data.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the question gives me two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which I think is important because it affects how much light they reflect.\n\nWait, the question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. So I remember that the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Since both have the same albedo, that part cancels out when taking the ratio.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the distance of each planet from the star? Oh, right, because they used the radial velocity method. The RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis (distance). The shift in the forbidden line [OI] is given for each planet. Oh, but how does that translate into velocity?\n\nThe Doppler shift (or the RV) is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I think is something like delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c. But wait, in this case, the shifts are given in Angstroms. Let me think: the shift is given as up to 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1 and 0.04 \u00c5 for Planet2. The line is at 6300 \u00c5.\n\nSo delta lambda = 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1 and 0.04 for Planet2. The formula for Doppler shift is delta lambda / lambda = v/c. So v = (delta lambda / lambda) * c.\n\nBut wait, the star's velocity is what's causing the shift. The star's velocity is due to the planet's orbit. The RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. So K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. \n\nThe formula for K is K = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(1/3) ) Hmm, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that K is approximately proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / a)^(1/3) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of their velocities from the given shifts.\n\nWait, the star's velocity is K, which is the semi-amplitude. So since both planets are around the same star, the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, so M_planet << M_star. So M_star is 1.5 solar masses.\n\nSo for each planet, K is proportional to (M_planet) / (a^(1/3)) )? Or perhaps I should think about the mass and period relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of their velocities (K1/K2) based on the given shifts. Since delta lambda is proportional to K (because delta lambda = (K * c) / c * (1/lambda) ), so delta lambda is proportional to K. So K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.\n\nWait, but the shift is given for the same line, so yes, the shifts are proportional to the velocity amplitudes. So K1 = 0.03, K2=0.04? Wait, no, the actual shifts are 0.03 and 0.04, but I think it's delta lambda over lambda. So the actual velocity would be (0.03 / 6300) * c and (0.04 / 6300) * c. But since we're taking the ratio, the 6300 cancels out.\n\nSo K1 = (0.03 /6300 ) * c, K2 = (0.04/6300)*c. So K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4.\n\nNow, from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 day) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, maybe I should use the simplified version when M_p << M_*.\n\nSo K = (v) = ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ (P^(1/3)) )) ) * something. Hmm, maybe I should look up the formula again. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = ( (27 * pi * G) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I can consider that for a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / P )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )\n\nBut perhaps another approach is better. Since both planets are around the same star, and their masses are much smaller than the star's mass, we can approximate M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*. So K is approximately:\n\nK \u2248 ( (2 pi G) / (P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) )\n\nBut without knowing the periods, maybe I can relate the semi-major axes using Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law states that P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G (M_* + M_p) )\n\nBut since M_p << M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, so:\n\nP^2 \u2248 (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_* )\n\nTake cube roots: a^3 = ( G M_* P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )\n\nBut maybe it's better to express a in terms of K.\n\nWait, from the RV method, K is related to a. Let me think: The star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbital speed v_p. Since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So v_* = (M_p / M_*) * v_p.\n\nBut v_p is the planet's orbital speed, which is (2 pi a_p ) / P, where a_p is the planet's orbital radius (semi-major axis). Similarly, the star's speed is K = (M_p / M_*) * v_p.\n\nSo K = (M_p / M_*) * (2 pi a_p ) / P.\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a_p^3 ) / ( G (M_* + M_p) ) )\n\nAgain, since M_p << M_*, P^2 \u2248 (4 pi^2 a_p^3 ) / ( G M_* )\n\nSo P = sqrt( (4 pi^2 a_p^3 ) / ( G M_* ) )\n\nPutting this into the K equation:\n\nK = (M_p / M_*) * (2 pi a_p ) / ( sqrt( (4 pi^2 a_p^3 ) / ( G M_* ) ) ) )\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\nsqrt( (4 pi^2 a_p^3 ) / ( G M_* ) ) ) = sqrt(4 pi^2 a_p^3 ) / sqrt( G M_* )\n\n= (2 pi a_p^(3/2) ) / ( sqrt( G M_* ) )\n\nSo K = (M_p / M_*) * (2 pi a_p ) * sqrt( G M_* ) / (2 pi a_p^(3/2) ) )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n2 pi cancels.\n\nM_p / M_* remains.\n\na_p in numerator is a_p^1, denominator is a_p^(3/2) \u2192 a_p^( -1/2 )\n\nsqrt( G M_* ) is (G M_*)^(1/2 )\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nK = (M_p / M_*) * ( a_p^(1/2) ) * sqrt( G M_* )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= M_p * sqrt( G M_* ) / M_* * sqrt( a_p )\n\nWait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me redo the substitution.\n\nWait, the substitution steps:\n\nK = (M_p / M_*) * [ 2 pi a_p / ( (2 pi a_p^(3/2) ) / sqrt( G M_* )) ) ]\n\nSo the denominator is 2 pi a_p^(3/2) / sqrt(G M_* )\n\nSo the entire denominator is [ (2 pi a_p^(3/2) ) / sqrt(G M_* ) ]\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\nK = (M_p / M_*) * [ 2 pi a_p * sqrt(G M_*) ) / (2 pi a_p^(3/2) ) ) ]\n\nThe 2 pi terms cancel.\n\nWe get (M_p / M_*) * [ a_p * sqrt(G M_*) ) / a_p^(3/2) ) ]\n\nWhich is (M_p / M_*) * [ sqrt(G M_*) ) / a_p^(1/2) ) ]\n\nSo K = ( M_p * sqrt(G M_*) ) / ( M_* * sqrt(a_p) ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= ( M_p / M_*^(1/2) ) * sqrt( G / a_p )\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to express a_p in terms of K.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express a_p as proportional to ( K^(-2) ) * M_*^(something) * M_p^(something). Hmm, maybe another approach. Let's think about the ratio of K1 and K2.\n\nWe have K1/K2 = 3/4 (from the shifts).\n\nFrom the RV formula, K is proportional to ( M_p / a_p^(1/2) )\n\nBecause K \u221d (M_p) / (a_p^(1/2) ), given that other factors (like star mass, G, etc.) are the same for both planets.\n\nSo K1/K2 = (M_p1 / a1^(1/2)) / (M_p2 / a2^(1/2)) )\n\nWhich is (M_p1 / M_p2) * (a2^(1/2) / a1^(1/2)) )\n\nBut K1/K2 = 3/4.\n\nSo,\n\n(7 /5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 3/4\n\nWait, because M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5. So M_p1/M_p2 is 7/5.\n\nSo,\n\n(7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 3/4\n\nSolve for sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) = 15/(28) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28.\n\nSquare both sides: a2/a1 = (225)/(784) \u2248 0.287.\n\nSo a1 = a2 * (784/225) \u2248 a2 * 3.484.\n\nHmm, but wait, I think I got that backward. Because if sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28, then a2/a1 = (15/28)^2, so a1 is larger than a2. So a1 is larger, meaning Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.\n\nWait, but wait, let's be precise.\n\nWe have:\n\n(7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 3/4\n\nMultiply both sides by (5/7):\n\nsqrt( a2/a1 ) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15/28.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\na2/a1 = (15/28)^2 = 225/784 \u2248 0.287.\n\nSo a1 = a2 * (784/225) \u2248 3.484 * a2.\n\nSo Planet1 is about 3.484 times farther from the star than Planet2.\n\nNow, the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance.\n\nThe formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - albedo) factor is the same for both, so it cancels out when taking the ratio.\n\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2a1)) / (R_star / (2a2)) ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause the R_star and 2 in denominator cancel out.\n\nSo T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( (a2/a1) ) = sqrt( 225/784 ) ) = 15/28 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nWait, but that's the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. So T_eq1 is about 0.5357 times T_eq2. So the ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is ~0.5357, which is approximately 0.53.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps.\n\n1. K is proportional to (M_p / sqrt(a_p) ), since K = (v) = (M_p / M_*) * (something involving a_p). But I derived that K is proportional to M_p / sqrt(a_p) because other factors are same for both.\n\n2. So K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\n3. 3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\n4. So sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) = 15/28.\n\n5. So a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 \u2192 a1 is larger than a2.\n\n6. T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star / a ), so T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) \u2192 which is sqrt( 225/784 ) = 15/28 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo yes, the ratio is ~0.53, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the question gives me two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which I think is important because it affects how much light they reflect.\n\nWait, the question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. So I remember that the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Since both have the same albedo, that part cancels out when taking the ratio.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the distance of each planet from the star? Oh, right, because they used the radial velocity method. The RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis (distance). The shift in the forbidden line [OI] is given for each planet. Oh, but how does that translate into velocity?\n\nThe Doppler shift (or the RV) is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I think is something like delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c. But wait, in this case, the shifts are given in Angstroms. Let me think: the shift is given as up to 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1 and 0.04 \u00c5 for Planet2. The line is at 6300 \u00c5.\n\nSo delta lambda = 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1 and 0.04 for Planet2. The formula for Doppler shift is delta lambda / lambda = v/c. So v = (delta lambda / lambda) * c.\n\nBut wait, the star's velocity is what's causing the shift. The star's velocity is due to the planet's orbit. The RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. So K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. \n\nThe formula for K is K = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(1/3) ) Hmm, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that K is approximately proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / a)^(1/3) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of their velocities from the given shifts.\n\nWait, the star's velocity is K, which is the semi-amplitude. So since both planets are around the same star, the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, so M_planet << M_star. So M_star is 1.5 solar masses.\n\nSo for each planet, K is proportional to (M_planet) / (a^(1/3)) )? Or perhaps I should think about the mass and period relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of their velocities (K1/K2) based on the given shifts. Since delta lambda is proportional to K (because delta lambda = (K * c) / c * (1/lambda) ), so delta lambda is proportional to K. So K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.\n\nWait, but the shift is given for the same line, so yes, the shifts are proportional to the velocity amplitudes. So K1 = 0.03, K2=0.04? Wait, no, the actual shifts are 0.03 and 0.04, but I think it's delta lambda over lambda. So the actual velocity would be (0.03 / 6300) * c and (0.04 / 6300) * c. But since we're taking the ratio, the 6300 cancels out.\n\nSo K1 = (0.03 /6300 ) * c, K2 = (0.04/6300)*c. So K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4.\n\nNow, from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 day) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, maybe I should use the simplified version when M_p << M_*.\n\nSo K = (v) = ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ (P^(1/3)) )) ) * something. Hmm, maybe I should look up the formula again. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = ( (27 * pi * G) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I can consider that for a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / P )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )\n\nBut perhaps another approach is better. Since both planets are around the same star, and their masses are much smaller than the star's mass, we can approximate M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*. So K is approximately:\n\nK \u2248 ( (2 pi G) / (P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) )\n\nBut without knowing the periods, maybe I can relate the semi-major axes using Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law states that P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G (M_* + M_p) )\n\nBut since M_p << M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, so:\n\nP^2 \u2248 (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_* )\n\nTake cube roots: a^3 = ( G M_* P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )\n\nBut maybe it's better to express a in terms of K.\n\nWait, from the RV method, K is related to a. Let me think: The star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbital speed v_p. Since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So v_* = (M_p / M_*) * v_p.\n\nBut v_p is the planet's orbital speed, which is (2 pi a_p ) / P, where a_p is the planet's orbital radius (semi-major axis). Similarly, the star's speed is K = (M_p / M_*) * v_p.\n\nSo K = (M_p / M_*) * (2 pi a_p ) / P.\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a_p^3 ) / ( G (M_* + M_p) ) )\n\nAgain, since M_p << M_*, P^2 \u2248 (4 pi^2 a_p^3 ) / ( G M_* )\n\nSo P = sqrt( (4 pi^2 a_p^3 ) / ( G M_* ) )\n\nPutting this into the K equation:\n\nK = (M_p / M_*) * (2 pi a_p ) / ( sqrt( (4 pi^2 a_p^3 ) / ( G M_* ) ) ) )\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\nsqrt( (4 pi^2 a_p^3 ) / ( G M_* ) ) ) = sqrt(4 pi^2 a_p^3 ) / sqrt( G M_* )\n\n= (2 pi a_p^(3/2) ) / ( sqrt( G M_* ) )\n\nSo K = (M_p / M_*) * (2 pi a_p ) * sqrt( G M_* ) / (2 pi a_p^(3/2) ) )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n2 pi cancels.\n\nM_p / M_* remains.\n\na_p in numerator is a_p^1, denominator is a_p^(3/2) \u2192 a_p^( -1/2 )\n\nsqrt( G M_* ) is (G M_*)^(1/2 )\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nK = (M_p / M_*) * ( a_p^(1/2) ) * sqrt( G M_* )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= M_p * sqrt( G M_* ) / M_* * sqrt( a_p )\n\nWait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me redo the substitution.\n\nWait, the substitution steps:\n\nK = (M_p / M_*) * [ 2 pi a_p / ( (2 pi a_p^(3/2) ) / sqrt( G M_* )) ) ]\n\nSo the denominator is 2 pi a_p^(3/2) / sqrt(G M_* )\n\nSo the entire denominator is [ (2 pi a_p^(3/2) ) / sqrt(G M_* ) ]\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\nK = (M_p / M_*) * [ 2 pi a_p * sqrt(G M_*) ) / (2 pi a_p^(3/2) ) ) ]\n\nThe 2 pi terms cancel.\n\nWe get (M_p / M_*) * [ a_p * sqrt(G M_*) ) / a_p^(3/2) ) ]\n\nWhich is (M_p / M_*) * [ sqrt(G M_*) ) / a_p^(1/2) ) ]\n\nSo K = ( M_p * sqrt(G M_*) ) / ( M_* * sqrt(a_p) ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= ( M_p / M_*^(1/2) ) * sqrt( G / a_p )\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to express a_p in terms of K.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express a_p as proportional to ( K^(-2) ) * M_*^(something) * M_p^(something). Hmm, maybe another approach. Let's think about the ratio of K1 and K2.\n\nWe have K1/K2 = 3/4 (from the shifts).\n\nFrom the RV formula, K is proportional to ( M_p / a_p^(1/2) )\n\nBecause K \u221d (M_p) / (a_p^(1/2) ), given that other factors (like star mass, G, etc.) are the same for both planets.\n\nSo K1/K2 = (M_p1 / a1^(1/2)) / (M_p2 / a2^(1/2)) )\n\nWhich is (M_p1 / M_p2) * (a2^(1/2) / a1^(1/2)) )\n\nBut K1/K2 = 3/4.\n\nSo,\n\n(7 /5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 3/4\n\nWait, because M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5. So M_p1/M_p2 is 7/5.\n\nSo,\n\n(7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 3/4\n\nSolve for sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) = 15/(28) \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28.\n\nSquare both sides: a2/a1 = (225)/(784) \u2248 0.287.\n\nSo a1 = a2 * (784/225) \u2248 a2 * 3.484.\n\nHmm, but wait, I think I got that backward. Because if sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28, then a2/a1 = (15/28)^2, so a1 is larger than a2. So a1 is larger, meaning Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.\n\nWait, but wait, let's be precise.\n\nWe have:\n\n(7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 3/4\n\nMultiply both sides by (5/7):\n\nsqrt( a2/a1 ) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15/28.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\na2/a1 = (15/28)^2 = 225/784 \u2248 0.287.\n\nSo a1 = a2 * (784/225) \u2248 3.484 * a2.\n\nSo Planet1 is about 3.484 times farther from the star than Planet2.\n\nNow, the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance.\n\nThe formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - albedo) factor is the same for both, so it cancels out when taking the ratio.\n\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2a1)) / (R_star / (2a2)) ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause the R_star and 2 in denominator cancel out.\n\nSo T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( (a2/a1) ) = sqrt( 225/784 ) ) = 15/28 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nWait, but that's the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. So T_eq1 is about 0.5357 times T_eq2. So the ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is ~0.5357, which is approximately 0.53.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps.\n\n1. K is proportional to (M_p / sqrt(a_p) ), since K = (v) = (M_p / M_*) * (something involving a_p). But I derived that K is proportional to M_p / sqrt(a_p) because other factors are same for both.\n\n2. So K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\n3. 3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\n4. So sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) = 15/28.\n\n5. So a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 \u2192 a1 is larger than a2.\n\n6. T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star / a ), so T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) \u2192 which is sqrt( 225/784 ) = 15/28 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo yes, the ratio is ~0.53, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{eq}} = T_{\\text{star}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a}} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\text{albedo}\\right)^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the \\((1 - \\text{albedo})^{1/4}\\) term cancels out when taking the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Thus, the ratio simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{\\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\\text{eq,2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\). The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \\(K\\) is proportional to \\(\\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}\\), where \\(M_p\\) is the planet's mass and \\(a\\) is its orbital distance. For both planets, the star's mass dominates, so \\(K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}\\).\n\nGiven the shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, the RV semi-amplitudes are proportional to the shifts: \\(K_1 = 0.03 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\) and \\(K_2 = 0.04 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\). Thus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\nUsing the proportionality \\(K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(M_{p1} = 7 \\, M_{\\text{Earth}}\\) and \\(M_{p2} = 5 \\, M_{\\text{Earth}}\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{7}{5} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{15}{28}\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{15}{28}\\right)^2 = \\frac{225}{784}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\frac{784}{225} \\approx 3.484\n\\]\n\nFinally, substituting \\(\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{225}{784}\\) into the equilibrium temperature ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{\\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\\text{eq,2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nAlright, the setup: there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times the Sun's, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 and Planet2. Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. \n\nThey detected these planets using both transit and radial velocity methods. The transit method would tell us about the planet's size, while the RV method gives us the mass, I think. So, the RV method detects the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. The options are A to D. The planets have the same albedo, so that should simplify things because albedo affects how much light they reflect, but if it's the same, we don't have to factor that in.\n\nEquilibrium temperature formula: I remember it's something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Oh wait, but since the albedo is the same for both planets, the (1 - albedo) term will cancel out when taking the ratio. So I can ignore that part.\n\nSo the equilibrium temperature for each planet would be proportional to the star's temperature multiplied by the square root of (R_star/(2a)), where a is the planet's orbital distance.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't give us the orbital distances directly. Hmm. How can I find a for each planet?\n\nAh, maybe the RV method gives us information about the semi-major axis. Because the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which depends on the planet's mass and the size of the orbit. \n\nThe RV shift depends on the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude K of the RV is given by:\n\nK = (v) = [ (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2\u03c0))^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3) )\n\nWait, but the problem says both orbits are circular, so e=0. So that simplifies things a bit. Also, since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, M_planet is negligible compared to M_star. So M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star.\n\nBut let's think about it more carefully. The RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = [ (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2\u03c0))^(1/3) * (1/(P)) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe I should recall the correct formula for K. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the velocity of the star's orbit around the barycenter. The formula is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2\u03c0 c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to think about the relation between the RV shift and the semi-major axis. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )\n\nBut since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate (1 + M_planet/M_star) \u2248 1, so K \u2248 ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / M_star^(2/3) )\n\nBut wait, we don't know the orbital periods P. Hmm. So maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the Doppler shift is given by the formula involving the velocity of the star. The shift is proportional to the velocity. So the RV shift (\u0394\u03bb) is given by:\n\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 (v/c) * \u03bb\n\nWhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the spectral line. For small velocities, this approximation holds.\n\nIn the problem, Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. Similarly, Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nSo the velocity of the star due to Planet1 is v1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) * c.\n\nWait, let's compute this. The Doppler shift formula is:\n\n\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c\n\nSo v = c * (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb)\n\nGiven that \u0394\u03bb for Planet1 is 0.03 \u00c5, and \u03bb is 6300 \u00c5.\n\nSo v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c\n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c\n\nSo v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e8 m/s \u2248 (approx) 1.4286e3 m/s? Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly.\n\nWait, 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-3 / 6.3e3 = 3 / 6.3e6 = approximately 4.76e-7.\n\nv = 4.76e-7 * c, c is about 3e8 m/s.\n\nv1 = 4.76e-7 * 3e8 = 4.76e2 m/s? Wait, 4.76e-7 * 3e8 = (4.76 * 3) * 1e( -7 +8 ) = 14.28 * 1e1 = 142.8 m/s.\n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04/6300) * 3e8.\n\n0.04 /6300 = 4e-5 /6.3e3 = 4/(6.3e8) = approx 6.349e-9.\n\nv2 = 6.349e-9 * 3e8 = ~1.904e0 m/s? Wait, no, wait. 0.04 /6300 = (4e-2)/(6.3e3) )= (4)/(6.3e5) )= approx 6.349e-6.\n\nSo v2 = 6.349e-6 * 3e8 = 1.904e3 m/s? Wait, 6.349e-6 *3e8 = (6.349 *3 )e( -6 +8 )= 19.047e2= 1904.7 m/s? That can't be right. Wait, 6.349e-6 times 3e8 is (6.349 *3) = ~19.047, times 1e2 (since 1e8 *1e-6 is 1e2), so 19.047 *1e2 = 1904.7 m/s.\n\nWait, that's a very high velocity. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the exponents.\n\nWait, let's do it step by step.\n\nv1 = (0.03 /6300 ) * c\n\n0.03 /6300 = 0.03 /6.3e3 = 3e-2 /6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5) \u2248 4.7619e-6.\n\nMultiply by c (3e8 m/s):\n\nv1 = 4.7619e-6 *3e8 = (4.7619 *3 )e( -6 +8 ) = 14.2857e2 = 1428.57 m/s.\n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04 /6300 ) *3e8.\n\n0.04 /6300 = 4e-2 /6.3e3 =4/(6.3e5) \u22486.349e-6.\n\nv2 =6.349e-6 *3e8 = (6.349 *3 )e( -6 +8 )= 19.047e2= 1904.7 m/s.\n\nWait, but that's a problem because 1904 m/s is like 2 km/s, which is very high for a planet's induced RV. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-8 meters. The original wavelength is 6300 \u00c5, which is 6300e-10 meters = 6.3e-7 meters.\n\nSo the relative shift is \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = (3e-8 m) / (6.3e-7 m) ) = (3e-8) / (6.3e-7) )= (3/6.3)*1e-1 = 0.476 * 0.1 = 0.0476.\n\nSo \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 0.0476, so v = c * 0.0476.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s, so v1 = 3e8 *0.0476 \u2248 1.428e7 m/s? No, wait, 0.0476 is 4.76e-2.\n\nWait, no, 0.0476 is 4.76e-2.\n\nSo v1 = 3e8 m/s * 4.76e-2 = 3e8 * 0.0476 \u2248 1.428e7 m/s? No, that can't be right because that's way higher than the speed of light. That must be wrong.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me compute 3e8 * 0.0476.\n\n3e8 is 300,000,000 m/s. Multiply by 0.0476.\n\n300,000,000 * 0.0476 = 14,280,000 m/s? That can't be correct because that's much larger than the speed of light. Wait, that can't be right. Clearly, I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, no, wait. 3e8 * 0.0476 is 3e8 * 4.76e-2 = 3 *4.76e0 *1e6 = 14.28 *1e6 = 1.428e7 m/s. But 1.4e7 m/s is 14,000 km/s, which is way more than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s, or 3e8 m/s). So this is impossible. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should think in terms of velocities. Let me correct this. The formula is:\n\nv = (c) * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb)\n\nSo for Planet1: \u0394\u03bb=0.03 \u00c5, \u03bb=6300 \u00c5.\n\n\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 0.03 /6300 = 0.0000047619.\n\nv1 = 3e8 m/s * 0.0000047619 = 3e8 * 4.7619e-6 = 3 *4.7619e2 = 1428.57 m/s.\n\nOh, okay, that's more reasonable. So v1 is approximately 1428.57 m/s.\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2: \u0394\u03bb=0.04 \u00c5.\n\n\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb=0.04/6300=0.0000063492.\n\nv2=3e8 *6.3492e-6=3e8 *6.3492e-6=3*6.3492e2=1904.76 m/s.\n\nSo, the star's velocity due to Planet1 is about 1428.57 m/s, and for Planet2, 1904.76 m/s.\n\nNow, I need to relate these velocities to the semi-major axis of each planet's orbit. Because the RV method gives us the velocity amplitude, which is connected to the planet's mass and the semi-major axis.\n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 - e\u00b2 )^(1/2) )\n\nBut since e=0 (circular orbit), and M_p << M_*, we can approximate this as:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_* ) )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) \n\nBut we don't know the orbital periods P of the planets. Hmm. So maybe we can find the ratio of a1 to a2, the semi-major axes of Planet1 and Planet2, using their K values.\n\nBecause the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( (M_p) / (M_*)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )\n\nWait, but without knowing P, I might need another approach. Alternatively, maybe using Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law says that P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 G M_*)^(-1) * a\u00b3 (M_* + M_p) )\n\nSince M_p << M_*, P\u00b2 \u2248 (4\u03c0\u00b2 G M_* )^(-1) * a\u00b3 M_* )\n\nSo P\u00b2 \u2248 (4\u03c0\u00b2 G M_* )^(-1) * a^3 M_* ) = (4\u03c0\u00b2 G)^(-1) a^3 )\n\nSo P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_* )\n\nTaking cube roots: a = [ (G M_* P\u00b2 )/(4\u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nBut I'm not sure that's helpful yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a ratio of a1 and a2.\n\nLet me think about the relation between K and a. From the RV formula, we can express K in terms of a.\n\nWait, from the radial velocity method, the formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) )\n\nBut using Kepler's law, P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_* )\n\nSo P = sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_* ) )\n\nSo 2\u03c0 / P = 2\u03c0 / sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_* ) )\n\n= 2\u03c0 * sqrt( G M_* ) / sqrt(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )\n\n= 2\u03c0 * sqrt( G M_* ) / ( 2 \u03c0 sqrt( a\u00b3 ) )\n\n= sqrt( G M_* ) / sqrt( a\u00b3 )\n\nSo 2\u03c0/P = sqrt( G M_* ) / (a^(3/2) )\n\nPutting this into the K equation:\n\nK \u2248 [ (G M_p ) / (M_* ) ]^(1/3) * [ sqrt( G M_* ) / (a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\n= [ G M_p / M_* ]^(1/3 ) * [ (G M_* )^(1/2) / a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= [ G^(1) M_p^(1) M_*^(-1) ]^(1/3 ) * [ G^(1/2) M_*^(1/2) a^(-3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nMultiply exponents:\n\n= G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/3) * G^(1/6) M_*^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nG: (1/3 + 1/6) = 1/2 \u2192 G^(1/2)\nM_p: 1/3 \u2192 M_p^(1/3)\nM_*: (-1/3 + 1/6 )= (-1/6) \u2192 M_*^(-1/6)\na: (-1/2 )\n\nSo K = G^(1/2) * M_p^(1/3) * M_*^(-1/6) * a^(-1/2 ) / sqrt(1 - e\u00b2 )\n\nBut e=0, so K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/6) ) / a^(1/2 )\n\nRearranged:\n\nK = ( G^(1/2) ) / a^(1/2) ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) )\n\nSo K = sqrt( G / a ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) )\n\nBut solving for a:\n\nsqrt( G / a ) = K * M_*^(1/6) / M_p^(1/3 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nG/a = [ K^2 * M_*^(1/3) ] / M_p^(2/3 )\n\nRearranged:\n\na = G * M_p^(2/3) / ( K^2 M_*^(1/3) )\n\nSo for each planet, a is proportional to ( M_p^(2/3) ) / ( K^2 M_*^(1/3) )\n\nSince we are looking for the ratio a1/a2, let's compute that.\n\na1/a2 = [ (M1^(2/3) ) / ( K1^2 M_*^(1/3) ) ] / [ (M2^(2/3) ) / ( K2^2 M_*^(1/3) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\na1/a2 = ( M1^(2/3) / K1^2 ) * ( K2^2 / M2^(2/3) )\n\n= ( M1^(2/3) / M2^(2/3) ) * ( K2^2 / K1^2 )\n\n= ( (M1/M2)^(2/3) ) * ( (K2/K1)^2 )\n\nSo a1/a2 = ( (7/5)^(2/3) ) * ( (1904.76 /1428.57 )^2 )\n\nWait, because K1 is the velocity from Planet1 (1428.57 m/s), and K2 is from Planet2 (1904.76 m/s). So K2 > K1.\n\nCompute the numbers:\n\nFirst, M1 =7 Earth masses, M2=5. So (7/5) = 1.4. (7/5)^(2/3) = (1.4)^(2/3). Let me compute that.\n\n1.4^1 \u22481.4, 1.4^(1/3)\u22481.119. So 1.4^(2/3) \u2248 (1.119)^2\u22481.253.\n\nNext, K2/K1 = 1904.76 / 1428.57 \u22481.3333.\n\nSo (K2/K1)^2 = (4/3)^2 = 16/9 \u22481.7778.\n\nSo a1/a2 = 1.253 * 1.7778 \u2248 2.226.\n\nSo a1 is about 2.226 times a2.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me recheck the calculations.\n\nWait, 1904.76 /1428.57 is exactly 1.3333333... because 1428.57 * 4/3 = 1904.76. So 4/3 is correct.\n\nSo (4/3)^2 = 16/9 \u22481.7778.\n\nSo a1/a2 = (7/5)^(2/3) * (4/3)^2.\n\nCompute (7/5)^(2/3):\n\n7/5=1.4.\n\n1.4^(1/3) \u2248 1.11907.\n\nSquared: 1.11907^2 \u22481.252.\n\nSo 1.252 * (16/9) = 1.252 * 1.7778 \u2248 2.226.\n\nSo a1 is approximately 2.226 times a2. So a1 = 2.226 a2.\n\nWait, but that would mean Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2, which makes sense if it's causing a larger RV shift. Wait, no, because a higher K would imply a larger velocity, which depends on the planet's mass and the semi-major axis. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the relation between K and a again.\n\nWait, when a planet is closer to the star (smaller a), the RV semi-amplitude K is higher, assuming the planet's mass is the same. Because a smaller a leads to a higher velocity for the same mass.\n\nSo if K2 > K1, then a2 < a1. So Planet2 is closer in, Planet1 is farther out. That matches with a1/a2 =2.226.\n\nSo the ratio of their semi-major axes is approximately 2.226.\n\nNow, the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance a. The formula is:\n\nT_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) )\n\nSo, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T1/T2) is:\n\nsqrt( R_star/(2 a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) )\n\n= sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause R_star and 2 are constants, they cancel out.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWe found a1/a2 \u2248 2.226, so a2/a1 \u22481/2.226\u22480.449.\n\nSo sqrt(0.449) \u2248 0.67.\n\nWait, but let's compute it more accurately.\n\na1 =2.226 a2.\n\nSo a2/a1 =1/(2.226) \u22480.4491.\n\nSo sqrt(0.4491) \u22480.67.\n\nWait, 0.67 is approximately the ratio.\n\nWait, but let me compute it precisely.\n\n0.4491: square root.\n\nWhat's sqrt(0.4491)?\n\nWell, sqrt(0.49) is 0.7, sqrt(0.36)=0.6. So 0.4491 is between 0.49 and 0.36. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me approximate:\n\n0.67^2=0.4489. Oh, that's almost exactly 0.4491.\n\nSo sqrt(0.4491)= approximately 0.67.\n\nSo T1/T2\u22480.67.\n\nWait, but that would mean T1 is 0.67 times T2, so the ratio is about 0.67.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53, option A is ~0.98, option D is ~1.05, option B is ~1.30.\n\nHmm, 0.67 isn't directly an option. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check all the steps.\n\nFirst, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3 )\n\nBut we used Kepler's third law to substitute P, leading to:\n\na = G * M_p^(2/3) / ( K^2 * M_*^(1/3) )\n\nThen, a1/a2 = [ (M1^(2/3) ) / (K1^2) ) ] / [ (M2^(2/3) ) / (K2^2) ) ]\n\nWhich is (M1/M2)^(2/3) * (K2/K1)^2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo M1=7, M2=5.\n\nM1/M2=7/5=1.4.\n\n(M1/M2)^(2/3)= (1.4)^(2/3)= approximately 1.252.\n\nK2/K1=1904.76/1428.57=1.333333...\n\nSo (K2/K1)^2=(4/3)^2=16/9\u22481.7778.\n\nMultiply these: 1.252 *1.7778\u22482.226.\n\nSo a1/a2=2.226.\n\nThen, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(1/2.226)=sqrt(0.449)\u22480.67.\n\nHmm, but the options don't include 0.67.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for equilibrium temperature. Let me recheck.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nBut since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - albedo) term cancels in the ratio.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( R_* / (2 a1) ) / sqrt( R_* / (2 a2) )\n\n= sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The star's radius is R_*, but in the equilibrium temperature formula, it's R_*, the star's radius. So in our case, R_*, which is 1.2 times the Sun's radius.\n\nBut in the ratio, R_* cancels out because both planets share the same star, so R_* is same for both. So the ratio is indeed sqrt( a2/a1 ).\n\nSo T1 = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a1) )\n\nT2 = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a2) )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_* / (2 a1 )) / ( R_* / (2 a2 )) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich is what I had.\n\nSo the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ) \u2248 sqrt( 1 / 2.226 ) \u2248 0.67.\n\nBut the options don't include 0.67. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for K is different. Let me re-examine the RV formula.\n\nThe correct RV semi-amplitude formula is:\n\nK = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) * (1 - e\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) * (1 / c )\n\nWait, no, the formula is:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * [ 2\u03c0 / (P (1 - e\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3) / c^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a factor of c.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = ( (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) * c^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between K and the semi-major axis.\n\nAnother approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * ( (2\u03c0 ) / (P ) )^(1/3 ) / ( (1 - e\u00b2 )^(1/2) )\n\nBut since e=0, it's:\n\nK = ( (G M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3 ) * ( 2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3 )\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 ) / ( G M_* )\n\nSo P = sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 ) / ( G M_* ) )\n\nSubstituting into K:\n\nK = [ ( G M_p / M_* )^(1/3 ) ] * [ 2 \u03c0 / ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/( G M_* ) )^(1/2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nLet me compute the term inside the second bracket:\n\n2\u03c0 / [ (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/( G M_* ))^(1/2) ) ]\n\n= 2\u03c0 / [ (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )^(1/2) / ( G^(1/2) M_*^(1/2) ) ) ]\n\n= 2\u03c0 * G^(1/2) M_*^(1/2) / ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )^(1/2) )\n\n= 2\u03c0 * sqrt( G M_* ) / ( 2 \u03c0 sqrt( a\u00b3 ) )\n\n= [2 \u03c0 sqrt(G M_*) ] / [ 2 \u03c0 a^(3/2) )^(1/2) ]\n\nWait, perhaps another approach.\n\nDenominator inside the second term:\n\n(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/( G M_* ))^(1/2) ) = sqrt(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / sqrt( G M_* )\n\n= (2 \u03c0 a^(3/2) ) / sqrt( G M_* )\n\nSo the second term becomes:\n\n2 \u03c0 / [ (2 \u03c0 a^(3/2) ) / sqrt( G M_* ) ) ]\n\n= 2 \u03c0 * sqrt( G M_* ) / ( 2 \u03c0 a^(3/2) )\n\n= sqrt( G M_* ) / a^(3/2 )\n\nSo putting back into K:\n\nK = [ (G M_p / M_* )^(1/3 ) ] * [ sqrt( G M_* ) / a^(3/2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_*^(1/6) a^(-1) )\n\nMultiply exponents:\n\nG: (1/3 + 1/6 )= 1/2 \u2192 G^(1/2 )\n\nM_p: 1/3 \u2192 M_p^(1/3 )\n\nM_*: (-1/3 +1/6 )= -1/6 \u2192 M_*^(-1/6 )\n\na: -1 \u2192 a^(-1 )\n\nSo:\n\nK = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/6) ) / a )\n\nSo K = ( G^(1/2) ) / a ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) )\n\nRearranged:\n\na = ( G^(1/2) ) / ( K ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) )\n\nBut G is a constant, so when taking the ratio a1/a2, the G^(1/2) and other constants will cancel.\n\nSo,\n\na1/a2 = [ ( M1^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) ) ) / K1 ] / [ ( M2^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) ) ) / K2 ]\n\n= [ M1^(1/3) / K1 ] / [ M2^(1/3) / K2 ]\n\n= ( M1^(1/3) / M2^(1/3) ) * ( K2 / K1 )\n\n= ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * ( K2/K1 )\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier. I must have made a mistake in the earlier derivation.\n\nSo the correct ratio a1/a2 = ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * ( K2/K1 )\n\nAh, so that changes things.\n\nSo, M1 =7, M2=5.\n\nM1/M2=7/5=1.4.\n\n(1.4)^(1/3) \u22481.119.\n\nK2/K1=1904.76/1428.57\u22481.3333.\n\nSo a1/a2=1.119 *1.3333 \u22481.492.\n\nSo a1 is approximately 1.492 times a2.\n\nSo the ratio a1/a2\u22481.492.\n\nNow, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(1/1.492)=sqrt(0.6698)= approx 0.818.\n\nWait, 0.818 is approximately 0.82. But none of the options are close to that. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, let me compute this again.\n\nWait, if a1/a2=1.492, then a2/a1=1/1.492\u22480.6698.\n\nSo sqrt(0.6698)=approx 0.818.\n\nSo T1 is about 0.818 times T2.\n\nWait, but the options don't have that. The options are A) ~0.98, B) ~1.30, C) ~0.53, D) ~1.05.\n\nHmm. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of a1/a2.\n\nWait, let's recompute a1/a2 with the corrected formula:\n\na1/a2 = ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * (K2/K1 )\n\nM1=7, M2=5.\n\nM1/M2=1.4.\n\n(1.4)^(1/3)= approx 1.119.\n\nK2=1904.76, K1=1428.57.\n\nK2/K1=1904.76 /1428.57= exactly 1.33333333.\n\nSo 1.119 *1.33333333= let me compute this.\n\n1.119 *1.33333333=1.119 *4/3= (1.119 *4 ) /3 = 4.476 /3= 1.492.\n\nSo a1/a2=1.492.\n\nThus, T1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )=sqrt(1/1.492)=sqrt(0.6698)=~0.818.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the equilibrium temperature formula.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nBut I think I might have missed the star's radius in the denominator. Wait, no, the formula is correct. The star's radius R_* is in the numerator because the planet receives flux proportional to R_*^2 / a^2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the flux received by each planet.\n\nThe flux S at the planet's location is given by:\n\nS = L_*/ (4\u03c0 a\u00b2 )\n\nWhere L_* is the star's luminosity.\n\nThe star's luminosity L_* is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\nL_* =4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4\n\nSo S = (4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 ) / (4\u03c0 a\u00b2 ) ) = ( R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 ) / a\u00b2\n\nThe planet absorbs this flux, and assuming it's a blackbody, the equilibrium temperature T_p is given by:\n\nT_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nBecause the planet's albedo is the same for both, (1 - albedo) term cancels when taking the ratio.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBut according to our earlier calculation, a1 is about 1.492 times a2.\n\nSo a2/a1=1/1.492\u22480.6698.\n\nsqrt(0.6698)=0.818, so T1=0.818 T2.\n\nBut the options don't have this. The closest option is A) ~0.98, but that's much higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for K. Let me check another source.\n\nUpon reviewing, the correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = [ (v) ] = ( (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / (P (1 - e\u00b2) ) )^(1/3) ) / c^(1/3)\n\nBut given that M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / ( M_* ) )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / ( P (1 - e\u00b2) ) )^(1/3) ) / c^(1/3 )\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nK = ( (G / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (M_p )^(1/3) ) * (2\u03c0 )^(1/3) / ( P^(1/3) (1 - e\u00b2 )^(1/3) c^(1/3) )\n\nBut given that e=0, and considering P from Kepler's law.\n\nKepler's third law: P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 ) / ( G M_* )\n\nSo P = sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 ) / ( G M_* ) )\n\nSubstitute into K:\n\nK = ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/3) ) * (2\u03c0 )^(1/3) / ( [ (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/( G M_* ) )^(1/2) ]^(1/3) c^(1/3) )\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between K and a.\n\nAnother approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1 / a^(1/2) )\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let's see. From the corrected formula, K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( a M_*^(1/6) )\n\nSo K is proportional to ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( a M_*^(1/6) )\n\nSo K \u221d M_p^(1/3) / ( a M_*^(1/6) )\n\nSo for each planet, K is proportional to ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( a )\n\nSo K = C * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / a )\n\nWhere C is a constant depending on G, M_*, and c.\n\nSo for Planet1 and Planet2:\n\nK1 = C * ( M1^(1/3) ) / a1 )\n\nK2 = C * ( M2^(1/3) ) / a2 )\n\nTaking the ratio K2/K1 = ( M2^(1/3) / a2 ) / ( M1^(1/3) / a1 )\n\n= ( M2^(1/3) / M1^(1/3) ) * ( a1 / a2 )\n\nSo rearranged:\n\na1/a2 = ( K2/K1 ) * ( M1^(1/3) / M2^(1/3) )\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\na1/a2 = ( K2/K1 ) * ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) )\n\nSo substituting the values:\n\nK2/K1=1.3333, M1/M2=1.4.\n\n(1.4)^(1/3)=1.119.\n\nSo a1/a2=1.3333 *1.119\u22481.492.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo a1/a2\u22481.492.\n\nThus, T1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(1/1.492)=sqrt(0.6698)=approx 0.818.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of K.\n\nWait, let's recompute K for both planets.\n\nPlanet1: \u0394\u03bb=0.03\u00c5 at 6300\u00c5.\n\n\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb=0.03/6300=3e-5.\n\nv1= c*(\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb)=3e8 m/s * 3e-5=9e3 m/s=9 km/s.\n\nWait, wait, that's different from what I had earlier. Oh no, I think I messed up the exponents before.\n\nWait, 0.03 /6300 = 0.03/(6.3e3)=3e-2 /6.3e3=3/(6.3e5)= approx4.76e-6.\n\nv1=3e8 m/s *4.76e-6=1.428e3 m/s=1428 m/s.\n\nSimilarly, Planet2: \u0394\u03bb=0.04/6300=4e-5.\n\nv2=3e8 *4e-5=12e3 m/s=12 km/s.\n\nWait, no, wait, 0.04 /6300 =4e-2 /6.3e3=4e-5.\n\nSo v2=3e8 *4e-5=1.2e4 m/s=12,000 m/s=12 km/s.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought v1 was 1428 m/s and v2 1904.76 m/s. But that was based on an incorrect calculation.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the exponents earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\n\u0394\u03bb=0.03 \u00c5.\n\n\u03bb=6300 \u00c5.\n\n\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb=0.03/6300= 3e-2 /6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5)= approx 4.7619e-6.\n\nSo v1= c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb )=3e8 m/s *4.7619e-6=1428.57 m/s.\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2: \u0394\u03bb=0.04/6300=4e-2/6.3e3=4/(6.3e5)=6.3492e-6.\n\nv2=3e8 *6.3492e-6=1904.76 m/s.\n\nAh, so the initial calculations were correct. So K1=1428.57 m/s, K2=1904.76 m/s.\n\nSo K2/K1=1.3333.\n\nSo a1/a2= (K2/K1) * (M1/M2)^(1/3 )= 1.3333 * (7/5)^(1/3)=1.3333 *1.119\u22481.492.\n\nThus, a1=1.492 a2.\n\nSo T1/T2= sqrt( a2 /a1 )=sqrt(1/1.492)=sqrt(0.6698)= approx 0.818.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the Doppler shift given is the full shift, but the RV method measures the semi-amplitude, which is half the maximum shift. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding what the given shifts represent.\n\nWait, the problem states that Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5, and Planet2 up to 0.04 \u00c5. So those are the maximum shifts, which would correspond to twice the semi-amplitude, perhaps.\n\nWait, no. The RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity measured, so the maximum shift would be K * \u03bb. So the given shifts are the maximum shifts, which correspond to K * \u03bb.\n\nWait, wait, in the problem, the shift given is the maximum shift, which is K * \u03bb.\n\nWait, if that's the case, then the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity, so the maximum shift would be K * \u03bb.\n\nSo, for Planet1, K1 * \u03bb =0.03e-10 m.\n\nWait, \u03bb is 6300 \u00c5=6300e-10 m.\n\nSo K1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m ) =0.03 /6300 = same as before.\n\nWait, but this brings us back to the same K values as before. So perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the equilibrium temperature formula. Let me re-examine it.\n\nAnother approach: equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) )\n\nBecause the star's flux is L_*/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2 ), and L_*=4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4.\n\nSo S = L_*/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2 )= R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 / a\u00b2.\n\nThe planet absorbs this and radiates as a blackbody: S = \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nSo:\n\nR_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 / a\u00b2 = \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nCancel \u03c3:\n\nR_*\u00b2 T_*^4 / a\u00b2 = T_p^4.\n\nTake fourth root:\n\nT_p = T_* * ( R_* / a )^(1/2 )\n\nWait, that's the formula I used earlier.\n\nSo T_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / a )\n\nWait, but earlier I had sqrt( R_* / (2a) ), which may have been a mistake.\n\nWait, let me rederive it correctly.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is when the absorbed energy equals the emitted energy.\n\nAbsorbed power: (L_*/4\u03c0 a\u00b2 ) * (1 - albedo) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2\n\nEmitted power: 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nSet equal:\n\n(L_*/4\u03c0 a\u00b2 ) * (1 - albedo) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nSimplify:\n\n(L_*/4\u03c0 a\u00b2 ) * (1 - albedo) * \u03c0 =4\u03c0 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nCancel \u03c0:\n\n(L_/(4 a\u00b2 )) * (1 - albedo ) =4 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nL_ is 4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 )/(4 a\u00b2 ) ) * (1 - albedo ) =4 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nSimplify:\n\n( \u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 (1 - albedo) ) / a\u00b2 =4 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nCancel \u03c3:\n\n( \u03c0 R_*\u00b2 T_*^4 (1 - albedo) ) / a\u00b2 =4 T_p^4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n( \u03c0 R_*\u00b2 T_*^4 (1 - albedo) ) / a\u00b2 *4 =16 T_p^4\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach:\n\nAfter substituting L_*, the equation becomes:\n\n(4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 )/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2 ) * (1 - albedo ) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 =4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nSimplify:\n\n( R_*\u00b2 T_*^4 )/(a\u00b2 ) * (1 - albedo ) * (\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 ) =4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nCancel \u03c0 R_p\u00b2:\n\nR_*\u00b2 T_*^4 (1 - albedo ) / a\u00b2 =4 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nSo:\n\nT_p^4 = R_*\u00b2 T_*^4 (1 - albedo ) / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nTake fourth root:\n\nT_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a ) ) * (1 - albedo )^(1/4 )\n\nAh, so the correct formula includes a factor of 2 in the denominator.\n\nSo my initial formula was correct: T_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2a) ) * (1 - albedo )^(1/4 )\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / (2 a1) ) / sqrt( a2/(2 a2) ) ?\n\nWait, no, the ratio is:\n\nT1/T2 = [ sqrt( R_* / (2 a1) ) ] / [ sqrt( R_* / (2 a2) ) ]\n\n= sqrt( ( R_* / (2 a1 )) / ( R_* / (2 a2 )) )\n\n= sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo same as before.\n\nSo the ratio is still sqrt( a2/a1 )=sqrt(1/1.492)=0.818.\n\nBut the options don't have this.

Wait, but the question is about equilibrium temperature, which depends on a and R_*, which can be found via transit (for R_p and a), but without knowing a, perhaps I can relate the Doppler shifts to the masses and a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(a) )\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to note that for the same star, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be found from the ratio of the RV shifts and the planet masses.\n\nBut I'm stuck because the calculation leads to a ratio of ~0.818, which isn't among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended to have the same RV semi-amplitude for both planets, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a1/a2. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me compute a1 and a2 separately.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\na = ( G M_* )^(1/3) * ( P^(2/3) ) / ( (2\u03c0 )^(1/3) )\n\nBut without knowing P, this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, from the RV formula:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * ( 2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3 )\n\nBut P can be found from Kepler's third law.\n\nWait, perhaps I can relate the periods P1 and P2.\n\nFrom Kepler's law, P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3 / M_*.\n\nBut without a, I can't find P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a ratio of a1 to a2 using the ratio of K1 and K2 and the ratio of M1 and M2.\n\nWait, from K \u221d ( M_p^(1/3) ) / a )\n\nSo K1 / K2 = ( M1^(1/3) / a1 ) / ( M2^(1/3) / a2 ) )\n\n= ( M1^(1/3) / M2^(1/3) ) * ( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo rearranged:\n\na2/a1 = ( K1 / K2 ) * ( M1^(1/3) / M2^(1/3) )\n\nSo a2/a1 = ( K1/K2 ) * ( (M1/M2) )^(1/3 )\n\nWhich is the reciprocal of the earlier a1/a2.\n\nSo a1/a2= ( K2/K1 ) * ( M1/M2 )^(1/3 )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo with K2/K1=1.3333, M1/M2=1.4.\n\nSo a1/a2=1.3333 * 1.119\u22481.492.\n\nThus, T1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt( 1/1.492 )=0.818.\n\nBut since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to a^(1/2), not a.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that K is proportional to ( M_p ) / sqrt(a )\n\nIf that's the case, then K1/K2 = ( M1 / sqrt(a1) ) / ( M2 / sqrt(a2) )\n\n= ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo sqrt( a2/a1 ) = ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2 / M1 )\n\nSo T1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2/M1 )\n\nGiven K1=1428.57, K2=1904.76.\n\nK1/K2=1428.57/1904.76\u22480.75.\n\nM2=5, M1=7.\n\nSo M2/M1=5/7\u22480.714.\n\nSo T1/T2=0.75 *0.714\u22480.535.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.53, which is option C.\n\nAh, this matches one of the options. So perhaps the correct approach is that K is proportional to ( M_p ) / sqrt(a )\n\nIn that case, the ratio T1/T2=0.535, which is option C.\n\nBut why is this different from the earlier approach?\n\nAh, because the correct proportionality for K is K \u221d ( M_p ) / sqrt(a )\n\nSo let's rederive this.\n\nFrom the RV formula, K is given by:\n\nK = [ (G M_p ) / (M_* ) ]^(1/3) * [ 2\u03c0 / P ]^(1/3 )\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 ) / ( G M_* )\n\nSo P= sqrt(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/( G M_* )) )\n\nSo 2\u03c0/P = 2\u03c0 / sqrt(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/( G M_* )) ) = sqrt( G M_* ) / sqrt(a\u00b3 )\n\nSo K= [ (G M_p ) / M_* ]^(1/3 ) * [ sqrt( G M_* ) / sqrt(a\u00b3 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_*^(1/6) a^(-1/2) )\n\n= G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/6) a^(-1/2 )\n\nSo K= ( G^(1/2) ) / sqrt(a) ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) )\n\nSo K is proportional to ( M_p^(1/3) ) / sqrt(a )\n\nThus, K \u221d ( M_p )^(1/3) / a^(1/2 )\n\nSo, K1/K2= ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * sqrt( a2 /a1 )\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt( a2/a1 )= ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2/M1 )^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2/M1 )^(1/3 )\n\nNow, substituting the numbers:\n\nK1=1428.57 m/s, K2=1904.76 m/s.\n\nK1/K2=1428.57/1904.76\u22480.75.\n\nM2=5, M1=7.\n\n( M2/M1 )^(1/3 )= (5/7)^(1/3 )\u22480.7937.\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2=0.75 *0.7937\u22480.595.\n\nWait, but that's approximately 0.6, which is not exactly any of the options, but option C is 0.53.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a calculation error.\n\nWait, let me compute 5/7=0.7142857.\n\n(0.7142857)^(1/3) \u22480.8909.\n\nWait, no, wait: 0.9^3=0.729, which is higher than 0.714. So 0.89^3=0.7049, which is close to 0.714.\n\nSo (5/7)^(1/3 )\u22480.8909.\n\nSo T1/T2=0.75 *0.8909\u22480.668.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recalculate using exact values.\n\nCompute (5/7)^(1/3 ):\n\n5/7=0.71428571.\n\nCompute cube root:\n\n0.89^3=0.704969.\n\n0.895^3= approx 0.718.\n\nSo 0.89^3=0.704969, 0.895^3=0.718.\n\nWe have 0.71428571.\n\nSo, 0.71428571-0.704969=0.009316.\n\n0.718-0.704969=0.013031.\n\nSo, 0.71428571 is 0.009316 above 0.89^3.\n\nSo, the cube root is approximately 0.89 + (0.009316 / 0.013031 )*(0.005)= 0.89 + (0.715)(0.005)=0.89+0.003575=0.893575.\n\nSo approximately 0.8936.\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2=0.75 *0.8936\u22480.6702.\n\nStill around 0.67, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm. But earlier, when I thought K \u221d ( M_p ) / sqrt( a ), I got T1/T2\u22480.53, which is option C.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( a^(1/2) )\n\nBecause from the formula K = ( G^(1/2) ) / sqrt(a) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) )\n\nAssuming M_* is the same for both planets, we can write:\n\nK \u221d ( M_p^(1/3) ) / sqrt(a )\n\nSo K1/K2= ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * sqrt( a2 /a1 )\n\nWhich can be rearranged to:\n\nsqrt( a2/a1 )= ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2/M1 )^(1/3 )\n\nThus,\n\nT1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2/M1 )^(1/3 )\n\nSubstituting,\n\nK1/K2=0.75, ( M2/M1 )^(1/3 )= (5/7)^(1/3 )\u22480.8909.\n\nSo T1/T2=0.75 *0.8909\u22480.668.\n\nStill not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / sqrt(a) )\n\nWhich would imply K \u221d ( M_p )^(1/3) / sqrt(a )\n\nThus, K1/K2= ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( a2/a1 )= ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2/M1 )^(1/3 )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nHmm, but I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended for us to ignore the RV data and instead use the transit method. But the question provides the RV data, so that's unlikely.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem wants us to consider the ratio of the semi-major axes based on the RV shifts and the planet masses, without considering the constants, leading to a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is ( M1 * K1 ) / ( M2 * K2 )\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio of the semi-major axes is inversely proportional to the product of mass and velocity.\n\nWait, considering that the RV shift (K) is proportional to ( M_p / a )^(1/2 )\n\nWait, that might not be correct. I'm getting stuck here.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the fact that the only option close to my initial calculation is not present, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C) ~0.53, based on the assumption that K is proportional to ( M_p ) / sqrt( a ), leading to T1/T2\u22480.53.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) ~1.05, but that doesn't align with any of my calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is based on the ratio of the planet's masses and radii, but that doesn't make sense because equilibrium temperature depends on distance, not directly on mass or radius.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the flux each planet receives.\n\nFlux S = L_*/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2 )\n\nL_* =4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4.\n\nSo S = (4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 )/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2 ) )= R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 / a\u00b2.\n\nSo the ratio of fluxes S1/S2= ( R_*\u00b2 /a1\u00b2 ) / ( R_*\u00b2 /a2\u00b2 )= (a2/a1 )\u00b2.\n\nSo S1/S2= (a2/a1 )\u00b2.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is T_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a ) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nSo T_p \u221d sqrt(1/a ).\n\nThus, T1/T2= sqrt( a2 /a1 )= sqrt( 1/1.492 )=0.818.\n\nBut again, no matching option.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the intended approach was to realize that the RV shift is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis, leading to T1/T2\u22480.53, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nAlright, the setup: there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times the Sun's, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 and Planet2. Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. \n\nThey detected these planets using both transit and radial velocity methods. The transit method would tell us about the planet's size, while the RV method gives us the mass, I think. So, the RV method detects the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. The options are A to D. The planets have the same albedo, so that should simplify things because albedo affects how much light they reflect, but if it's the same, we don't have to factor that in.\n\nEquilibrium temperature formula: I remember it's something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Oh wait, but since the albedo is the same for both planets, the (1 - albedo) term will cancel out when taking the ratio. So I can ignore that part.\n\nSo the equilibrium temperature for each planet would be proportional to the star's temperature multiplied by the square root of (R_star/(2a)), where a is the planet's orbital distance.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't give us the orbital distances directly. Hmm. How can I find a for each planet?\n\nAh, maybe the RV method gives us information about the semi-major axis. Because the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which depends on the planet's mass and the size of the orbit. \n\nThe RV shift depends on the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude K of the RV is given by:\n\nK = (v) = [ (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2\u03c0))^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3) )\n\nWait, but the problem says both orbits are circular, so e=0. So that simplifies things a bit. Also, since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, M_planet is negligible compared to M_star. So M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star.\n\nBut let's think about it more carefully. The RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = [ (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2\u03c0))^(1/3) * (1/(P)) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe I should recall the correct formula for K. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the velocity of the star's orbit around the barycenter. The formula is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2\u03c0 c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to think about the relation between the RV shift and the semi-major axis. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )\n\nBut since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate (1 + M_planet/M_star) \u2248 1, so K \u2248 ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / M_star^(2/3) )\n\nBut wait, we don't know the orbital periods P. Hmm. So maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the Doppler shift is given by the formula involving the velocity of the star. The shift is proportional to the velocity. So the RV shift (\u0394\u03bb) is given by:\n\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 (v/c) * \u03bb\n\nWhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the spectral line. For small velocities, this approximation holds.\n\nIn the problem, Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. Similarly, Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 \u00c5.\n\nSo the velocity of the star due to Planet1 is v1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) * c.\n\nWait, let's compute this. The Doppler shift formula is:\n\n\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c\n\nSo v = c * (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb)\n\nGiven that \u0394\u03bb for Planet1 is 0.03 \u00c5, and \u03bb is 6300 \u00c5.\n\nSo v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c\n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c\n\nSo v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e8 m/s \u2248 (approx) 1.4286e3 m/s? Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly.\n\nWait, 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-3 / 6.3e3 = 3 / 6.3e6 = approximately 4.76e-7.\n\nv = 4.76e-7 * c, c is about 3e8 m/s.\n\nv1 = 4.76e-7 * 3e8 = 4.76e2 m/s?

Wait, no, wait. 0.04 /6300 = (4e-2)/(6.3e3) )= (4)/(6.3e5) )= approx 6.349e-6.\n\nSo v2 = 6.349e-6 * 3e8 = 1.904e3 m/s? Wait, 6.349e-6 *3e8 = (6.349 *3 )e( -6 +8 )= 19.047e2= 1904.7 m/s? That can't be right. Wait, 6.349e-6 times 3e8 is (6.349 *3) = ~19.047, times 1e2 (since 1e8 *1e-6 is 1e2), so 19.047 *1e2 = 1904.7 m/s.\n\nWait, that's a very high velocity. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the exponents.\n\nWait, let's do it step by step.\n\nv1 = (0.03 /6300 ) * c\n\n0.03 /6300 = 0.03 /6.3e3 = 3e-2 /6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5) \u2248 4.7619e-6.\n\nMultiply by c (3e8 m/s):\n\nv1 = 4.7619e-6 *3e8 = (4.7619 *3 )e( -6 +8 ) = 14.2857e2 = 1428.57 m/s.\n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04 /6300 ) *3e8.\n\n0.04 /6300 = 4e-2 /6.3e3 =4/(6.3e5) \u22486.349e-6.\n\nv2 =6.349e-6 *3e8 = (6.349 *3 )e( -6 +8 )= 19.047e2= 1904.7 m/s.\n\nWait, but that's a problem because 1904 m/s is like 2 km/s, which is very high for a planet's induced RV. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-8 meters. The original wavelength is 6300 \u00c5, which is 6300e-10 meters = 6.3e-7 meters.\n\nSo the relative shift is \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = (3e-8 m) / (6.3e-7 m) ) = (3e-8) / (6.3e-7) )= (3/6.3)*1e-1 = 0.476 * 0.1 = 0.0476.\n\nSo \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 0.0476, so v = c * 0.0476.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s, so v1 = 3e8 *0.0476 \u2248 1.428e7 m/s? No, wait, 0.0476 is 4.76e-2.\n\nWait, no, 0.0476 is 4.76e-2.\n\nSo v1 = 3e8 m/s * 4.76e-2 = 3e8 * 0.0476 \u2248 1.428e7 m/s? No, that can't be right because that's way higher than the speed of light. That must be wrong.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me compute 3e8 * 0.0476.\n\n3e8 is 300,000,000 m/s. Multiply by 0.0476.\n\n300,000,000 * 0.0476 = 14,280,000 m/s? That can't be correct because that's much larger than the speed of light. Wait, that can't be right. Clearly, I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, no, wait. 3e8 * 0.0476 is 3e8 * 4.76e-2 = 3 *4.76e0 *1e6 = 14.28 *1e6 = 1.428e7 m/s. But 1.4e7 m/s is 14,000 km/s, which is way more than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s, or 3e8 m/s). So this is impossible. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should think in terms of velocities. Let me correct this. The formula is:\n\nv = (c) * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb)\n\nSo for Planet1: \u0394\u03bb=0.03 \u00c5, \u03bb=6300 \u00c5.\n\n\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 0.03 /6300 = 0.0000047619.\n\nv1 = 3e8 m/s * 0.0000047619 = 3e8 * 4.7619e-6 = 3 *4.7619e2 = 1428.57 m/s.\n\nOh, okay, that's more reasonable. So v1 is approximately 1428.57 m/s.\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2: \u0394\u03bb=0.04 \u00c5.\n\n\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb=0.04/6300=0.0000063492.\n\nv2=3e8 *6.3492e-6=3e8 *6.3492e-6=3*6.3492e2=1904.76 m/s.\n\nSo, the star's velocity due to Planet1 is about 1428.57 m/s, and for Planet2, 1904.76 m/s.\n\nNow, I need to relate these velocities to the semi-major axis of each planet's orbit. Because the RV method gives us the velocity amplitude, which is connected to the planet's mass and the semi-major axis.\n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 - e\u00b2 )^(1/2) )\n\nBut since e=0 (circular orbit), and M_p << M_*, we can approximate this as:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_* ) )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) \n\nBut we don't know the orbital periods P of the planets. Hmm. So maybe we can find the ratio of a1 to a2, the semi-major axes of Planet1 and Planet2, using their K values.\n\nBecause the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( (M_p) / (M_*)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )\n\nWait, but without knowing P, I might need another approach. Alternatively, maybe using Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law says that P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 G M_*)^(-1) * a\u00b3 (M_* + M_p) )\n\nSince M_p << M_*, P\u00b2 \u2248 (4\u03c0\u00b2 G M_* )^(-1) * a\u00b3 M_* )\n\nSo P\u00b2 \u2248 (4\u03c0\u00b2 G M_* )^(-1) * a^3 M_* ) = (4\u03c0\u00b2 G)^(-1) a^3 )\n\nSo P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_* )\n\nTaking cube roots: a = [ (G M_* P\u00b2 )/(4\u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nBut I'm not sure that's helpful yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a ratio of a1 and a2.\n\nLet me think about the relation between K and a. From the RV formula, we can express K in terms of a.\n\nWait, from the radial velocity method, the formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) )\n\nBut using Kepler's law, P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_* )\n\nSo P = sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_* ) )\n\nSo 2\u03c0 / P = 2\u03c0 / sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_* ) )\n\n= 2\u03c0 * sqrt( G M_* ) / sqrt(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )\n\n= 2\u03c0 * sqrt( G M_* ) / ( 2 \u03c0 sqrt( a\u00b3 ) )\n\n= sqrt( G M_* ) / sqrt( a\u00b3 )\n\nSo 2\u03c0/P = sqrt( G M_* ) / (a^(3/2) )\n\nPutting this into the K equation:\n\nK \u2248 [ (G M_p ) / (M_* ) ]^(1/3) * [ sqrt( G M_* ) / (a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\n= [ G M_p / M_* ]^(1/3 ) * [ (G M_* )^(1/2) / a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= [ G^(1) M_p^(1) M_*^(-1) ]^(1/3 ) * [ G^(1/2) M_*^(1/2) a^(-3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nMultiply exponents:\n\n= G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/3) * G^(1/6) M_*^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nG: (1/3 + 1/6) = 1/2 \u2192 G^(1/2)\nM_p: 1/3 \u2192 M_p^(1/3)\nM_*: (-1/3 + 1/6 )= (-1/6) \u2192 M_*^(-1/6)\na: (-1/2 )\n\nSo K = G^(1/2) * M_p^(1/3) * M_*^(-1/6) * a^(-1/2 ) / sqrt(1 - e\u00b2 )\n\nBut e=0, so K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/6) ) / a^(1/2 )\n\nRearranged:\n\nK = ( G^(1/2) ) / a^(1/2) ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) )\n\nSo K = sqrt( G / a ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) )\n\nBut solving for a:\n\nsqrt( G / a ) = K * M_*^(1/6) / M_p^(1/3 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nG/a = [ K^2 * M_*^(1/3) ] / M_p^(2/3 )\n\nRearranged:\n\na = G * M_p^(2/3) / ( K^2 M_*^(1/3) )\n\nSo for each planet, a is proportional to ( M_p^(2/3) ) / ( K^2 M_*^(1/3) )\n\nSince we are looking for the ratio a1/a2, let's compute that.\n\na1/a2 = [ (M1^(2/3) ) / ( K1^2 M_*^(1/3) ) ] / [ (M2^(2/3) ) / ( K2^2 M_*^(1/3) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\na1/a2 = ( M1^(2/3) / K1^2 ) * ( K2^2 / M2^(2/3) )\n\n= ( M1^(2/3) / M2^(2/3) ) * ( K2^2 / K1^2 )\n\n= ( (M1/M2)^(2/3) ) * ( (K2/K1)^2 )\n\nSo a1/a2 = ( (7/5)^(2/3) ) * ( (1904.76 /1428.57 )^2 )\n\nWait, because K1 is the velocity from Planet1 (1428.57 m/s), and K2 is from Planet2 (1904.76 m/s). So K2 > K1.\n\nCompute the numbers:\n\nFirst, M1 =7 Earth masses, M2=5. So (7/5) = 1.4. (7/5)^(2/3) = (1.4)^(2/3). Let me compute that.\n\n1.4^1 \u22481.4, 1.4^(1/3)\u22481.119. So 1.4^(2/3) \u2248 (1.119)^2\u22481.253.\n\nNext, K2/K1 = 1904.76 / 1428.57 \u22481.3333.\n\nSo (K2/K1)^2 = (4/3)^2 = 16/9 \u22481.7778.\n\nSo a1/a2 = 1.253 * 1.7778 \u2248 2.226.\n\nSo a1 is about 2.226 times a2.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me recheck the calculations.\n\nWait, 1904.76 /1428.57 is exactly 1.3333333... because 1428.57 * 4/3 = 1904.76. So 4/3 is correct.\n\nSo (4/3)^2 = 16/9 \u22481.7778.\n\nSo a1/a2 = (7/5)^(2/3) * (4/3)^2.\n\nCompute (7/5)^(2/3):\n\n7/5=1.4.\n\n1.4^(1/3) \u2248 1.11907.\n\nSquared: 1.11907^2 \u22481.252.\n\nSo 1.252 * (16/9) = 1.252 * 1.7778 \u2248 2.226.\n\nSo a1 is approximately 2.226 times a2. So a1 = 2.226 a2.\n\nWait, but that would mean Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2, which makes sense if it's causing a larger RV shift. Wait, no, because a higher K would imply a larger velocity, which depends on the planet's mass and the semi-major axis. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the relation between K and a again.\n\nWait, when a planet is closer to the star (smaller a), the RV semi-amplitude K is higher, assuming the planet's mass is the same. Because a smaller a leads to a higher velocity for the same mass.\n\nSo if K2 > K1, then a2 < a1. So Planet2 is closer in, Planet1 is farther out. That matches with a1/a2 =2.226.\n\nSo the ratio of their semi-major axes is approximately 2.226.\n\nNow, the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance a. The formula is:\n\nT_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) )\n\nSo, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T1/T2) is:\n\nsqrt( R_star/(2 a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) )\n\n= sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause R_star and 2 are constants, they cancel out.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWe found a1/a2 \u2248 2.226, so a2/a1 \u22481/2.226\u22480.449.\n\nSo sqrt(0.449) \u2248 0.67.\n\nWait, but let's compute it more accurately.\n\na1 =2.226 a2.\n\nSo a2/a1 =1/(2.226) \u22480.4491.\n\nSo sqrt(0.4491) \u22480.67.\n\nWait, 0.67 is approximately the ratio.\n\nWait, but let me compute it precisely.\n\n0.4491: square root.\n\nWhat's sqrt(0.4491)?\n\nWell, sqrt(0.49) is 0.7, sqrt(0.36)=0.6. So 0.4491 is between 0.49 and 0.36. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me approximate:\n\n0.67^2=0.4489. Oh, that's almost exactly 0.4491.\n\nSo sqrt(0.4491)= approximately 0.67.\n\nSo T1/T2\u22480.67.\n\nWait, but that would mean T1 is 0.67 times T2, so the ratio is about 0.67.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53, option A is ~0.98, option D is ~1.05, option B is ~1.30.\n\nHmm, 0.67 isn't directly an option. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check all the steps.\n\nFirst, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3 )\n\nBut we used Kepler's third law to substitute P, leading to:\n\na = G * M_p^(2/3) / ( K^2 * M_*^(1/3) )\n\nThen, a1/a2 = [ (M1^(2/3) ) / (K1^2) ) ] / [ (M2^(2/3) ) / (K2^2) ) ]\n\nWhich is (M1/M2)^(2/3) * (K2/K1)^2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo M1=7, M2=5.\n\nM1/M2=7/5=1.4.\n\n(M1/M2)^(2/3)= (1.4)^(2/3)= approximately 1.252.\n\nK2/K1=1904.76/1428.57=1.333333...\n\nSo (K2/K1)^2=(4/3)^2=16/9\u22481.7778.\n\nMultiply these: 1.252 *1.7778\u22482.226.\n\nSo a1/a2=2.226.\n\nThen, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(1/2.226)=sqrt(0.449)\u22480.67.\n\nHmm, but the options don't include 0.67.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for equilibrium temperature. Let me recheck.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nBut since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - albedo) term cancels in the ratio.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( R_* / (2 a1) ) / sqrt( R_* / (2 a2) )\n\n= sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The star's radius is R_*, but in the equilibrium temperature formula, it's R_*, the star's radius. So in our case, R_*, which is 1.2 times the Sun's radius.\n\nBut in the ratio, R_* cancels out because both planets share the same star, so R_* is same for both. So the ratio is indeed sqrt( a2/a1 ).\n\nSo T1 = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a1) )\n\nT2 = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a2) )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_* / (2 a1 )) / ( R_* / (2 a2 )) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich is what I had.\n\nSo the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ) \u2248 sqrt( 1 / 2.226 ) \u2248 0.67.\n\nBut the options don't include 0.67. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for K is different. Let me re-examine the RV formula.\n\nThe correct RV semi-amplitude formula is:\n\nK = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) * (1 - e\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) * (1 / c )\n\nWait, no, the formula is:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * [ 2\u03c0 / (P (1 - e\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3) / c^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a factor of c.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = ( (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) * c^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between K and the semi-major axis.\n\nAnother approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * ( (2\u03c0 ) / (P ) )^(1/3 ) / ( (1 - e\u00b2 )^(1/2) )\n\nBut since e=0, it's:\n\nK = ( (G M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3 ) * ( 2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3 )\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 ) / ( G M_* )\n\nSo P = sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 ) / ( G M_* ) )\n\nSubstituting into K:\n\nK = [ ( G M_p / M_* )^(1/3 ) ] * [ 2 \u03c0 / ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/( G M_* ) )^(1/2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nLet me compute the term inside the second bracket:\n\n2\u03c0 / [ (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/( G M_* ))^(1/2) ) ]\n\n= 2\u03c0 / [ (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )^(1/2) / ( G^(1/2) M_*^(1/2) ) ) ]\n\n= 2\u03c0 * G^(1/2) M_*^(1/2) / ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )^(1/2) )\n\n= 2\u03c0 * sqrt( G M_* ) / ( 2 \u03c0 sqrt( a\u00b3 ) )\n\n= [2 \u03c0 sqrt(G M_*) ] / [ 2 \u03c0 a^(3/2) )^(1/2) ]\n\nWait, perhaps another approach.\n\nDenominator inside the second term:\n\n(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/( G M_* ))^(1/2) ) = sqrt(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / sqrt( G M_* )\n\n= (2 \u03c0 a^(3/2) ) / sqrt( G M_* )\n\nSo the second term becomes:\n\n2 \u03c0 / [ (2 \u03c0 a^(3/2) ) / sqrt( G M_* ) ) ]\n\n= 2 \u03c0 * sqrt( G M_* ) / ( 2 \u03c0 a^(3/2) )\n\n= sqrt( G M_* ) / a^(3/2 )\n\nSo putting back into K:\n\nK = [ (G M_p / M_* )^(1/3 ) ] * [ sqrt( G M_* ) / a^(3/2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_*^(1/6) a^(-1) )\n\nMultiply exponents:\n\nG: (1/3 + 1/6 )= 1/2 \u2192 G^(1/2 )\n\nM_p: 1/3 \u2192 M_p^(1/3 )\n\nM_*: (-1/3 +1/6 )= -1/6 \u2192 M_*^(-1/6 )\n\na: -1 \u2192 a^(-1 )\n\nSo:\n\nK = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/6) ) / a )\n\nSo K = ( G^(1/2) ) / a ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) )\n\nRearranged:\n\na = ( G^(1/2) ) / ( K ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) )\n\nBut G is a constant, so when taking the ratio a1/a2, the G^(1/2) and other constants will cancel.\n\nSo,\n\na1/a2 = [ ( M1^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) ) ) / K1 ] / [ ( M2^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) ) ) / K2 ]\n\n= [ M1^(1/3) / K1 ] / [ M2^(1/3) / K2 ]\n\n= ( M1^(1/3) / M2^(1/3) ) * ( K2 / K1 )\n\n= ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * ( K2/K1 )\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier. I must have made a mistake in the earlier derivation.\n\nSo the correct ratio a1/a2 = ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * ( K2/K1 )\n\nAh, so that changes things.\n\nSo, M1 =7, M2=5.\n\nM1/M2=7/5=1.4.\n\n(1.4)^(1/3) \u22481.119.\n\nK2/K1=1904.76/1428.57\u22481.3333.\n\nSo a1/a2=1.119 *1.3333 \u22481.492.\n\nSo a1 is approximately 1.492 times a2.\n\nSo the ratio a1/a2\u22481.492.\n\nNow, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(1/1.492)=sqrt(0.6698)= approx 0.818.\n\nWait, 0.818 is approximately 0.82. But none of the options are close to that. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, let me compute this again.\n\nWait, if a1/a2=1.492, then a2/a1=1/1.492\u22480.6698.\n\nSo sqrt(0.6698)=approx 0.818.\n\nSo T1 is about 0.818 times T2.\n\nWait, but the options don't have that. The options are A) ~0.98, B) ~1.30, C) ~0.53, D) ~1.05.\n\nHmm. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of a1/a2.\n\nWait, let's recompute a1/a2 with the corrected formula:\n\na1/a2 = ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * (K2/K1 )\n\nM1=7, M2=5.\n\nM1/M2=1.4.\n\n(1.4)^(1/3)= approx 1.119.\n\nK2=1904.76, K1=1428.57.\n\nK2/K1=1904.76 /1428.57= exactly 1.33333333.\n\nSo 1.119 *1.33333333= let me compute this.\n\n1.119 *1.33333333=1.119 *4/3= (1.119 *4 ) /3 = 4.476 /3= 1.492.\n\nSo a1/a2=1.492.\n\nThus, T1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )=sqrt(1/1.492)=sqrt(0.6698)=~0.818.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the equilibrium temperature formula.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nBut I think I might have missed the star's radius in the denominator. Wait, no, the formula is correct. The star's radius R_* is in the numerator because the planet receives flux proportional to R_*^2 / a^2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the flux received by each planet.\n\nThe flux S at the planet's location is given by:\n\nS = L_*/ (4\u03c0 a\u00b2 )\n\nWhere L_* is the star's luminosity.\n\nThe star's luminosity L_* is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\nL_* =4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4\n\nSo S = (4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 ) / (4\u03c0 a\u00b2 ) ) = ( R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 ) / a\u00b2\n\nThe planet absorbs this flux, and assuming it's a blackbody, the equilibrium temperature T_p is given by:\n\nT_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nBecause the planet's albedo is the same for both, (1 - albedo) term cancels when taking the ratio.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBut according to our earlier calculation, a1 is about 1.492 times a2.\n\nSo a2/a1=1/1.492\u22480.6698.\n\nsqrt(0.6698)=0.818, so T1=0.818 T2.\n\nBut the options don't have this. The closest option is A) ~0.98, but that's much higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for K. Let me check another source.\n\nUpon reviewing, the correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = [ (v) ] = ( (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / (P (1 - e\u00b2) ) )^(1/3) ) / c^(1/3)\n\nBut given that M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / ( M_* ) )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / ( P (1 - e\u00b2) ) )^(1/3) ) / c^(1/3 )\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nK = ( (G / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (M_p )^(1/3) ) * (2\u03c0 )^(1/3) / ( P^(1/3) (1 - e\u00b2 )^(1/3) c^(1/3) )\n\nBut given that e=0, and considering P from Kepler's law.\n\nKepler's third law: P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 ) / ( G M_* )\n\nSo P = sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 ) / ( G M_* ) )\n\nSubstitute into K:\n\nK = ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/3) ) * (2\u03c0 )^(1/3) / ( [ (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/( G M_* ) )^(1/2) ]^(1/3) c^(1/3) )\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between K and a.\n\nAnother approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1 / a^(1/2) )\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let's see. From the corrected formula, K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( a M_*^(1/6) )\n\nSo K is proportional to ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( a M_*^(1/6) )\n\nSo K \u221d M_p^(1/3) / ( a M_*^(1/6) )\n\nSo for each planet, K is proportional to ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( a )\n\nSo K = C * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / a )\n\nWhere C is a constant depending on G, M_*, and c.\n\nSo for Planet1 and Planet2:\n\nK1 = C * ( M1^(1/3) ) / a1 )\n\nK2 = C * ( M2^(1/3) ) / a2 )\n\nTaking the ratio K2/K1 = ( M2^(1/3) / a2 ) / ( M1^(1/3) / a1 )\n\n= ( M2^(1/3) / M1^(1/3) ) * ( a1 / a2 )\n\nSo rearranged:\n\na1/a2 = ( K2/K1 ) * ( M1^(1/3) / M2^(1/3) )\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\na1/a2 = ( K2/K1 ) * ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) )\n\nSo substituting the values:\n\nK2/K1=1.3333, M1/M2=1.4.\n\n(1.4)^(1/3)=1.119.\n\nSo a1/a2=1.3333 *1.119\u22481.492.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo a1/a2\u22481.492.\n\nThus, T1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(1/1.492)=sqrt(0.6698)=approx 0.818.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of K.\n\nWait, let's recompute K for both planets.\n\nPlanet1: \u0394\u03bb=0.03\u00c5 at 6300\u00c5.\n\n\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb=0.03/6300=3e-5.\n\nv1= c*(\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb)=3e8 m/s * 3e-5=9e3 m/s=9 km/s.\n\nWait, wait, that's different from what I had earlier. Oh no, I think I messed up the exponents before.\n\nWait, 0.03 /6300 = 0.03/(6.3e3)=3e-2 /6.3e3=3/(6.3e5)= approx4.76e-6.\n\nv1=3e8 m/s *4.76e-6=1.428e3 m/s=1428 m/s.\n\nSimilarly, Planet2: \u0394\u03bb=0.04/6300=4e-5.\n\nv2=3e8 *4e-5=12e3 m/s=12 km/s.\n\nWait, no, wait, 0.04 /6300 =4e-2 /6.3e3=4e-5.\n\nSo v2=3e8 *4e-5=1.2e4 m/s=12,000 m/s=12 km/s.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought v1 was 1428 m/s and v2 1904.76 m/s. But that was based on an incorrect calculation.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the exponents earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\n\u0394\u03bb=0.03 \u00c5.\n\n\u03bb=6300 \u00c5.\n\n\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb=0.03/6300= 3e-2 /6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5)= approx 4.7619e-6.\n\nSo v1= c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb )=3e8 m/s *4.7619e-6=1428.57 m/s.\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2: \u0394\u03bb=0.04/6300=4e-2/6.3e3=4/(6.3e5)=6.3492e-6.\n\nv2=3e8 *6.3492e-6=1904.76 m/s.\n\nAh, so the initial calculations were correct. So K1=1428.57 m/s, K2=1904.76 m/s.\n\nSo K2/K1=1.3333.\n\nSo a1/a2= (K2/K1) * (M1/M2)^(1/3 )= 1.3333 * (7/5)^(1/3)=1.3333 *1.119\u22481.492.\n\nThus, a1=1.492 a2.\n\nSo T1/T2= sqrt( a2 /a1 )=sqrt(1/1.492)=sqrt(0.6698)= approx 0.818.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the Doppler shift given is the full shift, but the RV method measures the semi-amplitude, which is half the maximum shift. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding what the given shifts represent.\n\nWait, the problem states that Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5, and Planet2 up to 0.04 \u00c5. So those are the maximum shifts, which would correspond to twice the semi-amplitude, perhaps.\n\nWait, no. The RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity measured, so the maximum shift would be K * \u03bb. So the given shifts are the maximum shifts, which correspond to K * \u03bb.\n\nWait, wait, in the problem, the shift given is the maximum shift, which is K * \u03bb.\n\nWait, if that's the case, then the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity, so the maximum shift would be K * \u03bb.\n\nSo, for Planet1, K1 * \u03bb =0.03e-10 m.\n\nWait, \u03bb is 6300 \u00c5=6300e-10 m.\n\nSo K1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m ) =0.03 /6300 = same as before.\n\nWait, but this brings us back to the same K values as before. So perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the equilibrium temperature formula. Let me re-examine it.\n\nAnother approach: equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) )\n\nBecause the star's flux is L_*/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2 ), and L_*=4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4.\n\nSo S = L_*/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2 )= R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 / a\u00b2.\n\nThe planet absorbs this and radiates as a blackbody: S = \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nSo:\n\nR_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 / a\u00b2 = \u03c3 T_p^4.\n\nCancel \u03c3:\n\nR_*\u00b2 T_*^4 / a\u00b2 = T_p^4.\n\nTake fourth root:\n\nT_p = T_* * ( R_* / a )^(1/2 )\n\nWait, that's the formula I used earlier.\n\nSo T_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / a )\n\nWait, but earlier I had sqrt( R_* / (2a) ), which may have been a mistake.\n\nWait, let me rederive it correctly.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is when the absorbed energy equals the emitted energy.\n\nAbsorbed power: (L_*/4\u03c0 a\u00b2 ) * (1 - albedo) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2\n\nEmitted power: 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nSet equal:\n\n(L_*/4\u03c0 a\u00b2 ) * (1 - albedo) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nSimplify:\n\n(L_*/4\u03c0 a\u00b2 ) * (1 - albedo) * \u03c0 =4\u03c0 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nCancel \u03c0:\n\n(L_/(4 a\u00b2 )) * (1 - albedo ) =4 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nL_ is 4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 )/(4 a\u00b2 ) ) * (1 - albedo ) =4 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nSimplify:\n\n( \u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 (1 - albedo) ) / a\u00b2 =4 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nCancel \u03c3:\n\n( \u03c0 R_*\u00b2 T_*^4 (1 - albedo) ) / a\u00b2 =4 T_p^4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n( \u03c0 R_*\u00b2 T_*^4 (1 - albedo) ) / a\u00b2 *4 =16 T_p^4\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach:\n\nAfter substituting L_*, the equation becomes:\n\n(4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 )/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2 ) * (1 - albedo ) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 =4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nSimplify:\n\n( R_*\u00b2 T_*^4 )/(a\u00b2 ) * (1 - albedo ) * (\u03c0 R_p\u00b2 ) =4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nCancel \u03c0 R_p\u00b2:\n\nR_*\u00b2 T_*^4 (1 - albedo ) / a\u00b2 =4 \u03c3 T_p^4\n\nSo:\n\nT_p^4 = R_*\u00b2 T_*^4 (1 - albedo ) / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nTake fourth root:\n\nT_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a ) ) * (1 - albedo )^(1/4 )\n\nAh, so the correct formula includes a factor of 2 in the denominator.\n\nSo my initial formula was correct: T_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2a) ) * (1 - albedo )^(1/4 )\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / (2 a1) ) / sqrt( a2/(2 a2) ) ?\n\nWait, no, the ratio is:\n\nT1/T2 = [ sqrt( R_* / (2 a1) ) ] / [ sqrt( R_* / (2 a2) ) ]\n\n= sqrt( ( R_* / (2 a1 )) / ( R_* / (2 a2 )) )\n\n= sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo same as before.\n\nSo the ratio is still sqrt( a2/a1 )=sqrt(1/1.492)=0.818.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the semi-major axis a is inversely proportional to the RV semi-amplitude K, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the RV method's dependence on a and use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude is proportional to (M_p) / (a)^(1/2).\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the RV semi-amplitude K being proportional to ( M_p ) / sqrt( a ) )\n\nBecause from K = (G M_p )^(1/3) * ( ... ) / a^(1/2 )\n\nWait, but earlier derivation shows K is proportional to ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( a ) )\n\nWait, no, earlier when a1/a2 = ( K2/K1 ) * ( M1^(1/3) / M2^(1/3) )\n\nBut perhaps the correct formula is K is proportional to ( M_p / a )^(1/2 )\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the ratio.\n\nGiven that the options don't match, perhaps I should reevaluate the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem doesn't require using the RV data, but instead uses the transit method. Wait, but the question is about equilibrium temperature, which depends on a and R_*, which can be found via transit (for R_p and a), but without knowing a, perhaps I can relate the Doppler shifts to the masses and a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(a) )\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to note that for the same star, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be found from the ratio of the RV shifts and the planet masses.\n\nBut I'm stuck because the calculation leads to a ratio of ~0.818, which isn't among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended to have the same RV semi-amplitude for both planets, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a1/a2. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me compute a1 and a2 separately.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\na = ( G M_* )^(1/3) * ( P^(2/3) ) / ( (2\u03c0 )^(1/3) )\n\nBut without knowing P, this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, from the RV formula:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * ( 2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3 )\n\nBut P can be found from Kepler's third law.\n\nWait, perhaps I can relate the periods P1 and P2.\n\nFrom Kepler's law, P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3 / M_*.\n\nBut without a, I can't find P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a ratio of a1 to a2 using the ratio of K1 and K2 and the ratio of M1 and M2.\n\nWait, from K \u221d ( M_p^(1/3) ) / a )\n\nSo K1 / K2 = ( M1^(1/3) / a1 ) / ( M2^(1/3) / a2 ) )\n\n= ( M1^(1/3) / M2^(1/3) ) * ( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo rearranged:\n\na2/a1 = ( K1 / K2 ) * ( M1^(1/3) / M2^(1/3) )\n\nSo a2/a1 = ( K1/K2 ) * ( (M1/M2) )^(1/3 )\n\nWhich is the reciprocal of the earlier a1/a2.\n\nSo a1/a2= ( K2/K1 ) * ( M1/M2 )^(1/3 )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo with K2/K1=1.3333, M1/M2=1.4.\n\nSo a1/a2=1.3333 * 1.119\u22481.492.\n\nThus, T1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt( 1/1.492 )=0.818.\n\nBut since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to a^(1/2), not a.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that K is proportional to ( M_p ) / sqrt(a )\n\nIf that's the case, then K1/K2 = ( M1 / sqrt(a1) ) / ( M2 / sqrt(a2) )\n\n= ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo sqrt( a2/a1 ) = ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2 / M1 )\n\nSo T1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2/M1 )\n\nGiven K1=1428.57, K2=1904.76.\n\nK1/K2=1428.57/1904.76\u22480.75.\n\nM2=5, M1=7.\n\nSo M2/M1=5/7\u22480.714.\n\nSo T1/T2=0.75 *0.714\u22480.535.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.53, which is option C.\n\nAh, this matches one of the options. So perhaps the correct approach is that K is proportional to ( M_p ) / sqrt(a )\n\nIn that case, the ratio T1/T2=0.535, which is option C.\n\nBut why is this different from the earlier approach?\n\nAh, because the correct proportionality for K is K \u221d ( M_p ) / sqrt(a )\n\nSo let's rederive this.\n\nFrom the RV formula, K is given by:\n\nK = [ (G M_p ) / (M_* ) ]^(1/3) * [ 2\u03c0 / P ]^(1/3 )\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 ) / ( G M_* )\n\nSo P= sqrt(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/( G M_* )) )\n\nSo 2\u03c0/P = 2\u03c0 / sqrt(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/( G M_* )) ) = sqrt( G M_* ) / sqrt(a\u00b3 )\n\nSo K= [ (G M_p ) / M_* ]^(1/3 ) * [ sqrt( G M_* ) / sqrt(a\u00b3 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\n= ( G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_*^(1/6) a^(-1/2) )\n\n= G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/6) a^(-1/2 )\n\nSo K= ( G^(1/2) ) / sqrt(a) ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) )\n\nSo K is proportional to ( M_p^(1/3) ) / sqrt(a )\n\nThus, K \u221d ( M_p )^(1/3) / a^(1/2 )\n\nSo, K1/K2= ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * sqrt( a2 /a1 )\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt( a2/a1 )= ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2/M1 )^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2/M1 )^(1/3 )\n\nNow, substituting the numbers:\n\nK1=1428.57 m/s, K2=1904.76 m/s.\n\nK1/K2=1428.57/1904.76\u22480.75.\n\nM2=5, M1=7.\n\n( M2/M1 )^(1/3 )= (5/7)^(1/3 )\u22480.7937.\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2=0.75 *0.7937\u22480.595.\n\nWait, but that's approximately 0.6, which is not exactly any of the options, but option C is 0.53.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a calculation error.\n\nWait, let me compute 5/7=0.7142857.\n\n(0.7142857)^(1/3) \u22480.8909.\n\nWait, no, wait: 0.9^3=0.729, which is higher than 0.714. So 0.89^3=0.7049, which is close to 0.714.\n\nSo (5/7)^(1/3 )\u22480.8909.\n\nSo T1/T2=0.75 *0.8909\u22480.668.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recalculate using exact values.\n\nCompute (5/7)^(1/3 ):\n\n5/7=0.71428571.\n\nCompute cube root:\n\n0.89^3=0.704969.\n\n0.895^3= approx 0.718.\n\nSo 0.89^3=0.704969, 0.895^3=0.718.\n\nWe have 0.71428571.\n\nSo, 0.71428571-0.704969=0.009316.\n\n0.718-0.704969=0.013031.\n\nSo, 0.71428571 is 0.009316 above 0.89^3.\n\nSo, the cube root is approximately 0.89 + (0.009316 / 0.013031 )*(0.005)= 0.89 + (0.715)(0.005)=0.89+0.003575=0.893575.\n\nSo approximately 0.8936.\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2=0.75 *0.8936\u22480.6702.\n\nStill around 0.67, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm. But earlier, when I thought K \u221d ( M_p ) / sqrt( a ), I got T1/T2\u22480.53, which is option C.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( a^(1/2) )\n\nBecause from the formula K = ( G^(1/2) ) / sqrt(a) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/6) )\n\nAssuming M_* is the same for both planets, we can write:\n\nK \u221d ( M_p^(1/3) ) / sqrt(a )\n\nSo K1/K2= ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * sqrt( a2 /a1 )\n\nWhich can be rearranged to:\n\nsqrt( a2/a1 )= ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2/M1 )^(1/3 )\n\nThus,\n\nT1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2/M1 )^(1/3 )\n\nSubstituting,\n\nK1/K2=0.75, ( M2/M1 )^(1/3 )= (5/7)^(1/3 )\u22480.8909.\n\nSo T1/T2=0.75 *0.8909\u22480.668.\n\nStill not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / sqrt(a) )\n\nWhich would imply K \u221d ( M_p )^(1/3) / sqrt(a )\n\nThus, K1/K2= ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( a2/a1 )= ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2/M1 )^(1/3 )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nHmm, but I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended for us to ignore the RV data and instead use the transit method. But the question provides the RV data, so that's unlikely.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem wants us to consider the ratio of the semi-major axes based on the RV shifts and the planet masses, without considering the constants, leading to a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is ( M1 * K1 ) / ( M2 * K2 )\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio of the semi-major axes is inversely proportional to the product of mass and velocity.\n\nWait, considering that the RV shift (K) is proportional to ( M_p / a )^(1/2 )\n\nWait, that might not be correct. I'm getting stuck here.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the fact that the only option close to my initial calculation is not present, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C) ~0.53, based on the assumption that K is proportional to ( M_p ) / sqrt( a ), leading to T1/T2\u22480.53.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) ~1.05, but that doesn't align with any of my calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is based on the ratio of the planet's masses and radii, but that doesn't make sense because equilibrium temperature depends on distance, not directly on mass or radius.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the flux each planet receives.\n\nFlux S = L_*/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2 )\n\nL_* =4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4.\n\nSo S = (4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 )/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2 ) )= R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 T_*^4 / a\u00b2.\n\nSo the ratio of fluxes S1/S2= ( R_*\u00b2 /a1\u00b2 ) / ( R_*\u00b2 /a2\u00b2 )= (a2/a1 )\u00b2.\n\nSo S1/S2= (a2/a1 )\u00b2.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is T_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a ) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nSo T_p \u221d sqrt(1/a ).\n\nThus, T1/T2= sqrt( a2 /a1 )= sqrt( 1/1.492 )=0.818.\n\nBut again, no matching option.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the intended approach was to realize that the RV shift is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis, leading to T1/T2\u22480.53, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the equilibrium temperature formula:\n\n\\[\nT_p = T_* \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} \\left(1 - \\text{albedo}\\right)^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the \\((1 - \\text{albedo})^{1/4}\\) term cancels out in the ratio. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude formula. The RV semi-amplitude \\(K\\) is proportional to:\n\n\\[\nK \\propto \\frac{M_p^{1/3}}{\\sqrt{a}}\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\(a\\), we get:\n\n\\[\na \\propto \\frac{M_p^{2/3}}{K^2}\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of the semi-major axes is then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\frac{\\frac{M_1^{2/3}}{K_1^2}}{\\frac{M_2^{2/3}}{K_2^2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_1}{M_2}\\right)^{2/3} \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Substituting the given values\n- \\(M_1 = 7\\) Earth masses, \\(M_2 = 5\\) Earth masses\n- \\(K_1 = 1428.57 \\, \\text{m/s}\\), \\(K_2 = 1904.76 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nFirst, calculate the mass ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{M_1}{M_2}\\right)^{2/3} = (1.4)^{2/3} \\approx 1.252\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the velocity ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{1904.76}{1428.57} \\approx 1.333\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^2 = (1.333)^2 \\approx 1.778\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the ratio of semi-major axes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = 1.252 \\times 1.778 \\approx 2.226\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the temperature ratio\nThe equilibrium temperature ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2.226}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.449} \\approx 0.67\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the options\nThe calculated ratio \\(T_1/T_2 \\approx 0.67\\) does not match any of the provided options. However, if we reinterpret the relationship between \\(K\\) and \\(a\\) as \\(K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}\\), the ratio becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{1428.57}{1904.76} \\approx 0.75\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx 0.891\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = 0.75 \\times 0.891 \\approx 0.668\n\\]\n\nThis still does not match the options. However, if we assume the problem intends for a simpler proportionality, the closest match to the given options is:\n\n**Option C) ~0.53**\n\nThis discrepancy suggests either an issue with the problem setup or an alternative interpretation of the RV data.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the problem says they have the same albedo, so that part cancels out in the ratio.\n\nThe formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5. Oh wait, but I think more accurately, the formula is T_planet = T_star * ( (L_star/(16\u03c0\u03c3)) / (4\u03c0 a\u00b2) )^0.25 * ( (1 - albedo)/4 )^0.5. Wait, maybe I should break it down more simply.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) / 4 )^0.5. But since both planets have the same albedo (A), that term (1-A)/4 is the same for both, so when taking the ratio, it cancels out. So the ratio T1/T2 will only depend on sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ), which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1). So the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1).\n\nWait, but I need to find the ratio of Planet1's temperature to Planet2's. So it's T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So if I can find the ratio of their orbital distances, I can find the temperature ratio.\n\nHow do I get their orbital distances? The problem mentions radial velocity (RV) shifts. Oh, right, the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis (a) based on the Doppler shift. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the star's mass, the planet's mass, and the distance.\n\nWait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K as K = (v) = (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(c)), but I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I think the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) * (1 + m/M)^2 ) ) ) ) * ( 2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ). But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term goes away. Also, since the star's mass is much larger than the planet, M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star, so M_planet/(M_star + M_planet) \u2248 M_planet/M_star.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * a^(1/3)) ), because the formula I remember is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2\u03c0/(P) )^(1/3) ) / c, but I might be getting this a bit wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relation between the RV shift and the planet's mass and distance.\n\nWait, the RV method gives the mass of the planet via the Doppler shift. The semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2\u03c0)/(P) )^(1/3) ) / c,\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, M_planet is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, P is the orbital period, and i is the inclination angle (which we can assume is 90 degrees, edge-on, so sin i = 1).\n\nBut since the star's mass is much larger than the planet, M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star. Also, since both planets are orbiting the same star, and the RV data is given, perhaps we can relate the RV shifts to the planet masses and their orbital periods or distances.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives the Doppler shifts in terms of the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5. The shift is given in Angstroms. So each planet causes a shift of 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5 respectively.\n\nWait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star in the direction of the observer, which is related to the planet's orbit. The formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (a (1 - e\u00b2))^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) / c.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a simpler way. I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(c)) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )\n\nBut since the planets have circular orbits, e=0, so 1-sqrt(e\u00b2) =1. Also, the period P can be related to the semi-major axis a via Kepler's third law: P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 G (M_star + M_planet)) / (a\u00b3). Since M_planet << M_star, we can approximate P\u00b2 \u2248 (4\u03c0\u00b2 G M_star ) / a\u00b3.\n\nPutting this into the equation for K:\n\nK = (27 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (a)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(c)) )\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the relationship between K, M_planet, and a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for K in terms of a and M_planet. Let me try to find K as a function of a.\n\nWait, I found a formula online in the past that K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3)) ), assuming M_planet << M_star and circular orbit (e=0), and i=90 degrees (so sin i =1).\n\nSo K = ( (G * M_planet ) / (c * (M_star)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to express K in terms of the planet's mass and the orbital distance a.\n\nI think the formula can be simplified as K = (v) = ( ( (G * M_planet ) / (4\u03c0\u00b2) )^(1/3) ) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )^(1/3) * (1/c) )\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the formula where K is proportional to (M_planet) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )\n\nBecause from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star), so P = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/(G M_star)) )^(1/2)\n\nSubstituting P into K's formula:\n\nK = ( (G * M_planet ) / (c * (M_star)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3/(G M_star)) )^(1/6) )\n\nHmm, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of K1 and K2, given that the RV shifts are 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5, respectively.\n\nSince K is the velocity semi-amplitude, which is in velocity units (like km/s), but here the shifts are given in Angstroms. Wait, how does that work?\n\nWait, the Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is related to the velocity. The formula is \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c. Here, the shifts are given in terms of \u0394\u03bb in Angstroms. The star's line is at 6300 \u00c5. So for Planet1, the shift is 0.03 \u00c5, so \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 0.03 / 6300 \u2248 4.76e-6. Then v = c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) = (3e5 km/s) * (4.76e-6) \u2248 1.428 km/s. Similarly for Planet2, \u0394\u03bb=0.04, so v= (0.04/6300)*3e5 \u2248 1.905 km/s.\n\nWait, so K1 is about 1.428 km/s, K2 is about 1.905 km/s.\n\nNow, since K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ), and assuming sin i is 1 for both (edge-on), and M_star is the same, we can write K1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/3)) / (M2 a1^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. K is proportional to (M_planet) / (a^(1/3) ) ), because K = (something) * (M_planet / (a^(1/3) )) ), since M_star is same for both.\n\nWait, because K \u221d (M_p / a^(1/3) ), with M_star being same. So K1/K2 = (M1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( M2 / a2^(1/3) ) ) = ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )\n\nSo, rearranged, (a2/a1) = ( ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2 / M1 ) )^3 )\n\nSo, first, let's compute K1 and K2:\n\nFor Planet1: \u0394\u03bb =0.03 \u00c5, \u03bb=6300 \u00c5. So \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 0.03/6300 \u2248 4.7619e-6. Then v = c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) = (3e5 km/s) * 4.7619e-6 \u2248 1.42858 km/s. So K1 \u2248 1.4286 km/s.\n\nFor Planet2: \u0394\u03bb=0.04 \u00c5. So v= (3e5) * (0.04/6300) \u2248 3e5 * 6.349e-6 \u2248 1.9048 km/s. So K2\u22481.9048 km/s.\n\nSo K1/K2 \u2248 1.4286 / 1.9048 \u2248 0.75.\n\nNow, M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses. So M1/M2 =7/5 =1.4.\n\nSo (K1/K2) = (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3) ) \u2192 0.75 = (1.4) * (a2/a1)^(1/3)\n\nSo, (a2/a1)^(1/3) = 0.75 / 1.4 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo (a2/a1) = (0.5357)^3 \u2248 0.1535.\n\nSo a2 \u2248 0.1535 a1.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm trying to find (a2/a1), which is (0.1535), so a2 is smaller than a1. That would mean Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1, which makes sense if Planet2 has a larger RV shift (since being closer, the star's velocity would change more).\n\nBut wait, the RV shift K depends on the planet's mass and the distance. A more massive planet or a closer planet would cause a larger K. So Planet2 has a higher K (1.9 vs 1.4), and higher mass (5 vs 7 Earth masses). Wait, M1 is 7, M2 is 5. So M1 is larger. But K2 is larger than K1, so perhaps a2 is smaller than a1.\n\nWait, let me recheck the calculation. K1/K2 is 0.75.\n\nSo, K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3) \u2192 0.75 = (7/5) * (a2/a1)^(1/3)\n\nWait, 7/5 is 1.4. So 0.75 = 1.4 * (a2/a1)^(1/3)\n\nSo (a2/a1)^(1/3) = 0.75 / 1.4 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nCubing both sides gives (a2/a1) = (0.5357)^3 \u2248 0.1535.\n\nSo a2 is about 0.1535 times a1, which means a2 is smaller than a1. So Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.\n\nNow, going back to the equilibrium temperature ratio. The formula I thought was T_eq \u221d sqrt(Rstar/(2a)).\n\nWait, more precisely, the equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) / 4 )^0.5.\n\nBut since albedo A is same for both planets, that term cancels out when taking the ratio.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, because:\n\nT1/T2 = [ sqrt( (R/(2a1)) ) ] / [ sqrt( (R/(2a2)) ) ] = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( (a2)/(a1) )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nWe found that a2/a1 \u2248 0.1535, so sqrt(0.1535) \u2248 0.3918.\n\nSo T1 is about 0.3918 times T2. So the ratio T1/T2 is ~0.39.\n\nWait, but the options don't include that. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) ~0.98\n\nB) ~1.30\n\nC) ~0.53\n\nD) ~1.05\n\nHmm, none of these are around 0.39. That suggests I might have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Did I mix up the ratio of a2/a1 or a1/a2?\n\nWait, in the K equation, K is proportional to (M_p / a^(1/3) ), so K1 = k * M1 / a1^(1/3), K2 = k * M2 / a2^(1/3).\n\nSo K1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/3) ) / ( M2 a1^(1/3) ) )\n\nWhich can be written as (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3) )\n\nSo, K1/K2 = (7/5) * (a2/a1)^(1/3) )\n\nWe found K1/K2 = 0.75. So:\n\n0.75 = (1.4) * (a2/a1)^(1/3)\n\nSo (a2/a1)^(1/3) = 0.75 / 1.4 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo (a2/a1) = (0.5357)^3 \u2248 0.1535.\n\nSo a2 = 0.1535 a1.\n\nSo a1 is larger than a2.\n\nNow, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), since T_eq \u221d sqrt(1/a).\n\nSo T1 is proportional to sqrt(1/a1), T2 proportional to sqrt(1/a2).\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich is sqrt(0.1535) \u2248 0.3918.\n\nSo T1 is about 0.39 times T2, so the ratio T1/T2 is ~0.39.\n\nBut none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should have considered the Doppler shift not just as velocity but also how it relates to the semi-amplitude K. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the mass function and the relation to the semi-major axis.\n\nWait, another approach: the RV method gives the mass of the planet in terms of the semi-amplitude K, the star's mass, and the planet's orbital period. The formula for the mass function is:\n\nf(M) = (M_p^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ) = (K^3 P ) / (27 pi G )\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to f(M) \u2248 (M_p^3 sin^3 i) / M_star^2.\n\nBut since we don't know the period P, perhaps we can relate the two planets' periods using Kepler's third law.\n\nFrom Kepler's law: P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G (M_star + M_p) )\n\nAssuming M_p << M_star, P\u00b2 \u2248 (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3) / ( G M_star )\n\nSo P1\u00b2 / P2\u00b2 = (a1\u00b3) / (a2\u00b3 )\n\nSo (P1/P2) = (a1/a2)^(3/2 )\n\nBut without knowing P, perhaps this isn't helpful directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find the ratio of a1 and a2 from the RV data.\n\nWait, from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3) ) ) / c.\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. Also, since sin i is 1 (edge-on), we can ignore it.\n\nSo K = ( ( G M_p )^(1/3) ) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(2/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the RV semi-amplitude is also given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / (P^(1/3)) ) ) / c.\n\nBut again, this might not directly help without P.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a relation between a1 and a2 using the RV shifts and their masses.\n\nWait, considering that K is proportional to (M_p) / (a^(1/3) ), since from Kepler's law, P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_star ), so P is proportional to a^(3/2) / sqrt(M_star) ).\n\nSubstituting P into the K formula, let's see:\n\nK = ( ( G M_p )^(1/3) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )\n\nBecause P is in the denominator, but P is proportional to a^(3/2) / (sqrt(M_star)), so 1/P^(1/3) is proportional to a^(-1/2) M_star^(1/6).\n\nPutting it all together, K is proportional to (M_p ) / ( a^(1/3) ) * (a^(-1/2)) ) ) = M_p a^(-5/6 )\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think that K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) a^(1/3) )\n\nSo K1 = k * M1 / ( M_star^(2/3) a1^(1/3) )\n\nSimilarly, K2 = k * M2 / ( M_star^(2/3) a2^(1/3) )\n\nDividing K1 by K2: K1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/3)) / ( M2 a1^(1/3) )\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3)\n\nWe have K1 = 0.75 K2, M1=7, M2=5.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = (7/5) * (a2/a1)^(1/3)\n\nSo,\n\n(a2/a1)^(1/3) = (0.75 *5)/7 = 3.75/7 \u2248 0.5357\n\nCubing both sides: a2/a1 \u2248 (0.5357)^3 \u2248 0.1535\n\nSo a2 = 0.1535 a1.\n\nNow, equilibrium temperature T_eq is given by:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A)/4 )^0.5\n\nSince A is same for both, (1-A)/4 is same, so the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.1535) \u2248 0.3918.\n\nHmm, but this isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check the K values.\n\nPlanet1's shift is 0.03 \u00c5 at 6300 \u00c5.\n\nSo, \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 0.03 / 6300 = 4.7619e-6.\n\nv = c * \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 3e5 km/s * 4.7619e-6 \u2248 1.42857 km/s. So K1\u22481.4286 km/s.\n\nPlanet2's shift is 0.04 \u00c5.\n\n\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 0.04/6300 \u2248 6.349e-6.\n\nv=3e5 *6.349e-6 \u2248 1.90476 km/s. So K2\u22481.9048 km/s.\n\nSo K1/K2=1.4286/1.9048\u22480.75. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation of a2/a1=0.1535 seems correct.\n\nHmm, but the temperature ratio is about 0.39, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I messed up the formula for T_eq.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A)/4 )^0.5.\n\nWait, no, maybe the correct formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5.\n\nWait, let me think. The equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_eq = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a\u00b2) ) ]^0.25\n\nBut L is the star's luminosity, which is given by L = 4 pi R_star\u00b2 sigma T_eff^4.\n\nSo substituting,\n\nT_eq = [ (4 pi R_star\u00b2 sigma T_eff^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a\u00b2) ) ]^0.25\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ ( R_star\u00b2 T_eff^4 (1 - A) ) / (4 a\u00b2) ) ]^0.25\n\n= [ ( R_star\u00b2 T_eff^4 (1 - A) ) / (4 a\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4)\n\n= ( R_star^2 )^(1/4) * ( T_eff^4 )^(1/4) * ( (1-A)/4 )^(1/4) * (1/a\u00b2)^(1/4)\n\n= R_star^(1/2) T_eff * ( (1-A)/4 )^(1/4) * (1/a)^(1/2)\n\nSo,\n\nT_eq = T_eff * sqrt( R_star/(a) ) * ( (1-A)/4 )^(1/4 )\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the distance and the star's characteristics.\n\nAlternatively, I've seen the formula written as T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5.\n\nWait, but in any case, the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich is what I did earlier, giving T1/T2 \u22480.39.\n\nBut since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the square root of the inverse ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute T2/T1 instead.\n\nWait, the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So it's T1/T2.\n\nBut maybe I should have taken the inverse.\n\nWait, if a2 is smaller than a1, then Planet2 is closer. So it should be hotter than Planet1. So T2 > T1.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 would be less than 1. But the options don't have anything below 0.5 except option C (~0.53). Hmm, 0.53 is close to 0.5357, which is the cube of 0.81. Wait, no, 0.5357 is the cube of 0.81? Let me compute 0.81^3: 0.81 * 0.81 = 0.6561, *0.81 \u2248 0.5314. Yes, that's close to 0.5357.\n\nWait, so a2/a1 = (0.5357)^3 \u22480.1535.\n\nWait, but sqrt(a2/a1) is sqrt(0.1535)\u22480.3918.\n\nBut option C is ~0.53, which is sqrt( (a2/a1) )? No, because 0.53^2 is 0.2809, which is not close to 0.1535.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the ratio backward. Let me think again: T_eq is proportional to sqrt(1/a), so T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a1), T2 to 1/sqrt(a2).\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWe have a2 =0.1535 a1.\n\nSo sqrt(0.1535) \u22480.3918.\n\nBut if I accidentally took a1/a2, then sqrt( a1/a2 )= sqrt(1/0.1535)=sqrt(6.518)\u22482.55.\n\nBut the options don't have that either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K1 and K2.\n\nWait, the problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5, and Planet2 induces a shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5 in the same line.\n\nSo, for each planet, the Doppler shift is given by:\n\nv = c * (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb )\n\nWhere c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s.\n\nSo for Planet1:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.03 \u00c5, \u03bb=6300 \u00c5.\n\nv1 = 3e5 km/s * (0.03/6300) \u2248 3e5 * 4.7619e-6 \u2248 1.42857 km/s.\n\nSimilarly, Planet2:\n\n\u0394\u03bb=0.04 \u00c5.\n\nv2=3e5 * (0.04/6300) \u2248 3e5 *6.349e-6 \u2248 1.90476 km/s.\n\nSo K1=1.4286 km/s, K2=1.9048 km/s. So K1/K2=0.75.\n\nEarlier steps seem correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider that the RV shift is the same as the semi-amplitude K, but perhaps I forgot to consider that the mass function depends on (M_p^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ), but since M_p is much less than M_star, it's approximately (M_p^3 )/( M_star^2 )\n\nSo, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( a^(1/3) )\n\nSo, K1 = k * M1 / a1^(1/3)\n\nK2 = k * M2 / a2^(1/3)\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/3) ) / ( M2 a1^(1/3) )\n\nWhich gives:\n\n0.75 = (7 a2^(1/3)) / (5 a1^(1/3) )\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 a1^(1/3):\n\n3.75 a1^(1/3) =7 a2^(1/3)\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\n(3.75/7) a1^(1/3) = a2^(1/3)\n\n(3.75/7)=0.5357.\n\nSo,\n\na2^(1/3) = 0.5357 a1^(1/3)\n\nCube both sides:\n\na2 = (0.5357)^3 a1 \u22480.1535 a1.\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nHmm, so the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a1)=0.3918. No option matches.\n\nBut wait, the star's radius is 1.2 solar radii. Maybe I should include that in the equilibrium temperature formula.\n\nWait, the formula I used earlier was T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )\n\nBut perhaps the correct formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5.\n\nWait, but when considering the star's luminosity, L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_eff^4.\n\nSo, the equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_eff * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5.\n\nAh, wait! I think I forgot the (1-A)^0.5 factor in the previous ratio. But since both planets have the same albedo, that factor is the same for both and cancels out in the ratio. So the ratio T1/T2 would still be sqrt( a2/(a1) ), because the (1-A) terms cancel.\n\nWait, no, because (1-A) is the same for both, so (1-A)^0.5 is same, so when taking the ratio T1/T2, it's sqrt(R/(2a1)) / sqrt(R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 ), same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think that the star's radius doesn't affect the ratio, since it's the same for both planets. So the ratio remains sqrt( a2/a1 )=0.3918.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the RV method gives the mass function, not the actual mass. But since both planets are around the same star and we can assume i=90 degrees, perhaps the masses are correct as given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the Doppler shift formula differently. Because the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5 is being observed, but perhaps the star's own spectrum lines are at 6300 \u00c5, so the shift is measured relative to that. So the calculation of velocity from \u0394\u03bb is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the star's actual rotation or other factors cause the line to be at 6300 \u00c5. Hmm, perhaps not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the velocity of the star, which is 2\u03c0 a (M_p/(M_star))^(1/3) / P^(1/3) ) / c.\n\nBut I think I'm going in circles.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the formula for equilibrium temperature. Let me double-check.\n\nThe correct formula for equilibrium temperature when the planet has an albedo A is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5.\n\nWait, but some sources say the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5.\n\nSo, the ratio would be sqrt( a2/a1 ), as before.\n\nWait, but if the answer isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the Doppler shifts are given in terms of the star's velocity, but in reality, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula for K in terms of the planet's mass and semi-major axis is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi ) / (P) )^(1/3) ) / c\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star.\n\nSo,\n\nK = ( ( G M_p )^(1/3) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_star )\n\nSo,\n\nP = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3 / ( G M_star )) )^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting P into K:\n\nK = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( ( G M_star )^(1/6) ) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) a^(-1/2) )\n\nSimplifying:\n\nK = (G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) (2 pi )^(1/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ) ) / ( c M_star^(2/3) (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) a^(1/2) )\n\nCombine the G terms: G^(1/3 +1/6) = G^(1/2)\n\nM_star terms: M_star^(1/6 -2/3) = M_star^(-1/2)\n\nSo,\n\nK = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( c (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) )\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n(2 pi )^(1/3) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) ) = [ (2 pi )^2 / 4 pi\u00b2 ]^(1/6) ) = [ (4 pi\u00b2 ) / (4 pi\u00b2) ) ]^(1/6) )=1.\n\nWait, let me compute it correctly.\n\n(2 pi )^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3)\n\n(4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) = (2\u00b2 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) )= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\n(2 pi )^(1/3) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) ) = [ 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ] / [ 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ) ] =1.\n\nSo K simplifies to:\n\nK = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )\n\n= ( G M_p )^(1/2) / ( c M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )\n\n= ( G M_p / ( c\u00b2 M_star a ) )^(1/2 )\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just accept that K is proportional to (M_p) / ( a^(1/2) )\n\nWait, from the expression above, K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )\n\nSo,\n\nK \u221d M_p^(1/3) / ( a^(1/2) )\n\nSo, K1/K2 = ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * ( a2^(1/2) / a1^(1/2) )\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = ( (7/5)^(1/3) ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nWe have K1/K2=0.75.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = (7/5)^(1/3) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nCompute (7/5)^(1/3) \u2248 (1.4)^(0.333) \u2248 1.119.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = 1.119 * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 /1.119 \u22480.670.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = (0.670)^2 \u22480.4489.\n\nSo, a2 =0.4489 a1.\n\nNow, equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(0.4489)=0.67.\n\nBut this is still not matching any of the options. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another way to relate the RV shifts to the semi-major axes.\n\nAnother approach: The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is related to the planet's mass and the distance a. The formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / (P ) )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3) / ( G M_star )\n\nSo P = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting into K:\n\nK = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( G M_star )^(1/6) ) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) a^(-3/2) )\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated, but let's try.\n\nSo,\n\nK = [ (G M_p )^(1/3) (2 pi )^(1/3) ) * ( G M_star )^(1/6) ) ] / [ c M_star^(2/3) (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) a^(3/2) ) ]\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nG: (1/3 +1/6) = 1/2\n\nM_p: 1/3\n\nM_star: (1/6 - 2/3) = (1/6 -4/6 )= -3/6 = -1/2\n\nSo,\n\nK = [ G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) (2 pi )^(1/3) ) ] / [ c (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) M_star^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) ]\n\nNow, simplifying the constants:\n\n(2 pi )^(1/3) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) ) = (2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ) / (2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ) ) =1.\n\nSo,\n\nK = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) )\n\nSo,\n\nK \u221d ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( a^(3/2) )\n\nWhich can be written as K \u221d M_p^(1/3) a^(-3/2)\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = ( (M1^(1/3) ) / a1^(3/2) ) ) / ( (M2^(1/3) ) / a2^(3/2) ) )\n\n= ( M1^(1/3) a2^(3/2) ) / ( M2^(1/3) a1^(3/2) )\n\n= ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * ( a2/a1 )^(3/2 )\n\nWe have K1/K2=0.75.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = ( (7/5)^(1/3) ) * ( a2/a1 )^(3/2 )\n\nCompute (7/5)^(1/3)= approx 1.4^(0.333)= approx 1.119.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = 1.119 * (a2/a1 )^(3/2 )\n\nDivide both sides by 1.119:\n\n0.75 /1.119 \u22480.670 = (a2/a1 )^(3/2 )\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 2/3:\n\n(0.670)^(2/3) = a2/a1.\n\nCompute 0.670^(2/3):\n\nFirst, ln(0.670)= approx -0.4005.\n\nMultiply by 2/3: -0.267.\n\nExponentiate: e^(-0.267)\u22480.766.\n\nSo, a2/a1\u22480.766.\n\nSo,\n\na2=0.766 a1.\n\nNow, equilibrium temperature ratio:\n\nT_eq \u221d sqrt(1/a), so T1/T2= sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(0.766 ) \u22480.875.\n\nHmm, but this is still not matching any options.

So the ratio is approximately 0.53.\n\nSo the answer would be option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the problem says they have the same albedo, so that part cancels out in the ratio.\n\nThe formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5. Oh wait, but I think more accurately, the formula is T_planet = T_star * ( (L_star/(16\u03c0\u03c3)) / (4\u03c0 a\u00b2) )^0.25 * ( (1 - albedo)/4 )^0.5. Wait, maybe I should break it down more simply.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) / 4 )^0.5. But since both planets have the same albedo (A), that term (1-A)/4 is the same for both, so when taking the ratio, it cancels out. So the ratio T1/T2 will only depend on sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ), which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1). So the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1).\n\nWait, but I need to find the ratio of Planet1's temperature to Planet2's. So it's T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So if I can find the ratio of their orbital distances, I can find the temperature ratio.\n\nHow do I get their orbital distances? The problem mentions radial velocity (RV) shifts. Oh, right, the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis (a) based on the Doppler shift. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the star's mass, the planet's mass, and the distance.\n\nWait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K as K = (v) = (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(c)), but I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I think the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) * (1 + m/M)^2 ) ) ) ) * ( 2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ). But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term goes away. Also, since the star's mass is much larger than the planet, M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star, so M_planet/(M_star + M_planet) \u2248 M_planet/M_star.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * a^(1/3)) ), because the formula I remember is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2\u03c0/(P) )^(1/3) ) / c, but I might be getting this a bit wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relation between the RV shift and the planet's mass and distance.\n\nWait, the RV method gives the mass of the planet via the Doppler shift. The semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2\u03c0)/(P) )^(1/3) ) / c,\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, M_planet is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, P is the orbital period, and i is the inclination angle (which we can assume is 90 degrees, edge-on, so sin i = 1).\n\nBut since the star's mass is much larger than the planet, M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star. Also, since both planets are orbiting the same star, and the RV data is given, perhaps we can relate the RV shifts to the planet masses and their orbital periods or distances.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives the Doppler shifts in terms of the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5. The shift is given in Angstroms. So each planet causes a shift of 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5 respectively.\n\nWait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star in the direction of the observer, which is related to the planet's orbit. The formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (a (1 - e\u00b2))^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) / c.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a simpler way. I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(c)) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )\n\nBut since the planets have circular orbits, e=0, so 1-sqrt(e\u00b2) =1. Also, the period P can be related to the semi-major axis a via Kepler's third law: P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 G (M_star + M_planet)) / (a\u00b3). Since M_planet << M_star, we can approximate P\u00b2 \u2248 (4\u03c0\u00b2 G M_star ) / a\u00b3.\n\nPutting this into the equation for K:\n\nK = (27 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (a)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(c)) )\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the relationship between K, M_planet, and a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for K in terms of a and M_planet. Let me try to find K as a function of a.\n\nWait, I found a formula online in the past that K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3)) ), assuming M_planet << M_star and circular orbit (e=0), and i=90 degrees (so sin i =1).\n\nSo K = ( (G * M_planet ) / (c * (M_star)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to express K in terms of the planet's mass and the orbital distance a.\n\nI think the formula can be simplified as K = (v) = ( ( (G * M_planet ) / (4\u03c0\u00b2) )^(1/3) ) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )^(1/3) * (1/c) )\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the formula where K is proportional to (M_planet) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )\n\nBecause from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star), so P = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/(G M_star)) )^(1/2)\n\nSubstituting P into K's formula:\n\nK = ( (G * M_planet ) / (c * (M_star)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3/(G M_star)) )^(1/6) )\n\nHmm, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of K1 and K2, given that the RV shifts are 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5, respectively.\n\nSince K is the velocity semi-amplitude, which is in velocity units (like km/s), but here the shifts are given in Angstroms. Wait, how does that work?\n\nWait, the Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is related to the velocity. The formula is \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c. Here, the shifts are given in terms of \u0394\u03bb in Angstroms. The star's line is at 6300 \u00c5. So for Planet1, the shift is 0.03 \u00c5, so \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 0.03 / 6300 \u2248 4.76e-6. Then v = c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) = (3e5 km/s) * (4.76e-6) \u2248 1.428 km/s. Similarly for Planet2, \u0394\u03bb=0.04, so v= (0.04/6300)*3e5 \u2248 1.905 km/s.\n\nWait, so K1 is about 1.428 km/s, K2 is about 1.905 km/s.\n\nNow, since K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ), and assuming sin i is 1 for both (edge-on), and M_star is the same, we can write K1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/3)) / (M2 a1^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. K is proportional to (M_planet) / (a^(1/3) ) ), because K = (something) * (M_planet / (a^(1/3) )) ), since M_star is same for both.\n\nWait, because K \u221d (M_p / a^(1/3) ), with M_star being same. So K1/K2 = (M1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( M2 / a2^(1/3) ) ) = ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )\n\nSo, rearranged, (a2/a1) = ( ( K1/K2 ) * ( M2 / M1 ) )^3 )\n\nSo, first, let's compute K1 and K2:\n\nFor Planet1: \u0394\u03bb =0.03 \u00c5, \u03bb=6300 \u00c5. So \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 0.03/6300 \u2248 4.7619e-6. Then v = c * (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) = (3e5 km/s) * 4.7619e-6 \u2248 1.42858 km/s. So K1 \u2248 1.4286 km/s.\n\nFor Planet2: \u0394\u03bb=0.04 \u00c5. So v= (3e5) * (0.04/6300) \u2248 3e5 * 6.349e-6 \u2248 1.9048 km/s. So K2\u22481.9048 km/s.\n\nSo K1/K2 \u2248 1.4286 / 1.9048 \u2248 0.75.\n\nNow, M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses. So M1/M2 =7/5 =1.4.\n\nSo (K1/K2) = (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3) ) \u2192 0.75 = (1.4) * (a2/a1)^(1/3)\n\nSo, (a2/a1)^(1/3) = 0.75 / 1.4 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo (a2/a1) = (0.5357)^3 \u2248 0.1535.\n\nSo a2 \u2248 0.1535 a1.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm trying to find (a2/a1), which is (0.1535), so a2 is smaller than a1. That would mean Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1, which makes sense if Planet2 has a larger RV shift (since being closer, the star's velocity would change more).\n\nBut wait, the RV shift K depends on the planet's mass and the distance. A more massive planet or a closer planet would cause a larger K. So Planet2 has a higher K (1.9 vs 1.4), and higher mass (5 vs 7 Earth masses). Wait, M1 is 7, M2 is 5. So M1 is larger. But K2 is larger than K1, so perhaps a2 is smaller than a1.\n\nWait, let me recheck the calculation. K1/K2 is 0.75.\n\nSo, K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3) \u2192 0.75 = (7/5) * (a2/a1)^(1/3)\n\nWait, 7/5 is 1.4. So 0.75 = 1.4 * (a2/a1)^(1/3)\n\nSo (a2/a1)^(1/3) = 0.75 / 1.4 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nCubing both sides gives (a2/a1) = (0.5357)^3 \u2248 0.1535.\n\nSo a2 is about 0.1535 times a1, which means a2 is smaller than a1. So Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.\n\nNow, going back to the equilibrium temperature ratio. The formula I thought was T_eq \u221d sqrt(Rstar/(2a)).\n\nWait, more precisely, the equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) / 4 )^0.5.\n\nBut since albedo A is same for both planets, that term cancels out when taking the ratio.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, because:\n\nT1/T2 = [ sqrt( (R/(2a1)) ) ] / [ sqrt( (R/(2a2)) ) ] = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( (a2)/(a1) )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nWe found that a2/a1 \u2248 0.1535, so sqrt(0.1535) \u2248 0.3918.\n\nSo T1 is about 0.3918 times T2. So the ratio T1/T2 is ~0.39.\n\nWait, but the options don't include that. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) ~0.98\n\nB) ~1.30\n\nC) ~0.53\n\nD) ~1.05\n\nHmm, none of these are around 0.39. That suggests I might have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Did I mix up the ratio of a2/a1 or a1/a2?\n\nWait, in the K equation, K is proportional to (M_p / a^(1/3) ), so K1 = k * M1 / a1^(1/3), K2 = k * M2 / a2^(1/3).\n\nSo K1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/3) ) / ( M2 a1^(1/3) ) )\n\nWhich can be written as (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3) )\n\nSo, K1/K2 = (7/5) * (a2/a1)^(1/3) )\n\nWe found K1/K2 = 0.75. So:\n\n0.75 = (1.4) * (a2/a1)^(1/3)\n\nSo (a2/a1)^(1/3) = 0.75 / 1.4 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo (a2/a1) = (0.5357)^3 \u2248 0.1535.\n\nSo a2 = 0.1535 a1.\n\nSo a1 is larger than a2.\n\nNow, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), since T_eq \u221d sqrt(1/a).\n\nSo T1 is proportional to sqrt(1/a1), T2 proportional to sqrt(1/a2).\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich is sqrt(0.1535) \u2248 0.3918.\n\nSo T1 is about 0.39 times T2, so the ratio T1/T2 is ~0.39.\n\nBut none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should have considered the Doppler shift not just as velocity but also how it relates to the semi-amplitude K. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the mass function and the relation to the semi-major axis.\n\nWait, another approach: the RV method gives the mass of the planet in terms of the semi-amplitude K, the star's mass, and the planet's orbital period. The formula for the mass function is:\n\nf(M) = (M_p^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ) = (K^3 P ) / (27 pi G )\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to f(M) \u2248 (M_p^3 sin^3 i) / M_star^2.\n\nBut since we don't know the period P, perhaps we can relate the two planets' periods using Kepler's third law.\n\nFrom Kepler's law: P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G (M_star + M_p) )\n\nAssuming M_p << M_star, P\u00b2 \u2248 (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3) / ( G M_star )\n\nSo P1\u00b2 / P2\u00b2 = (a1\u00b3) / (a2\u00b3 )\n\nSo (P1/P2) = (a1/a2)^(3/2 )\n\nBut without knowing P, perhaps this isn't helpful directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find the ratio of a1 and a2 from the RV data.\n\nWait, from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3) ) ) / c.\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. Also, since sin i is 1 (edge-on), we can ignore it.\n\nSo K = ( ( G M_p )^(1/3) ) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(2/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the RV semi-amplitude is also given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / (P^(1/3)) ) ) / c.\n\nBut again, this might not directly help without P.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a relation between a1 and a2 using the RV shifts and their masses.\n\nWait, considering that K is proportional to (M_p) / (a^(1/3) ), since from Kepler's law, P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_star ), so P is proportional to a^(3/2) / sqrt(M_star) ).\n\nSubstituting P into the K formula, let's see:\n\nK = ( ( G M_p )^(1/3) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )\n\nBecause P is in the denominator, but P is proportional to a^(3/2) / (sqrt(M_star)), so 1/P^(1/3) is proportional to a^(-1/2) M_star^(1/6).\n\nPutting it all together, K is proportional to (M_p ) / ( a^(1/3) ) * (a^(-1/2)) ) ) = M_p a^(-5/6 )\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think that K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) a^(1/3) )\n\nSo K1 = k * M1 / ( M_star^(2/3) a1^(1/3) )\n\nSimilarly, K2 = k * M2 / ( M_star^(2/3) a2^(1/3) )\n\nDividing K1 by K2: K1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/3)) / ( M2 a1^(1/3) )\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3)\n\nWe have K1 = 0.75 K2, M1=7, M2=5.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = (7/5) * (a2/a1)^(1/3)\n\nSo,\n\n(a2/a1)^(1/3) = (0.75 *5)/7 = 3.75/7 \u2248 0.5357\n\nCubing both sides: a2/a1 \u2248 (0.5357)^3 \u2248 0.1535\n\nSo a2 = 0.1535 a1.\n\nNow, equilibrium temperature T_eq is given by:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A)/4 )^0.5\n\nSince A is same for both, (1-A)/4 is same, so the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.1535) \u2248 0.3918.\n\nHmm, but this isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check the K values.\n\nPlanet1's shift is 0.03 \u00c5 at 6300 \u00c5.\n\nSo, \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 0.03 / 6300 = 4.7619e-6.\n\nv = c * \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 3e5 km/s * 4.7619e-6 \u2248 1.42857 km/s. So K1\u22481.4286 km/s.\n\nPlanet2's shift is 0.04 \u00c5.\n\n\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 0.04/6300 \u2248 6.349e-6.\n\nv=3e5 *6.349e-6 \u2248 1.90476 km/s. So K2\u22481.9048 km/s.\n\nSo K1/K2=1.4286/1.9048\u22480.75. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation of a2/a1=0.1535 seems correct.\n\nHmm, but the temperature ratio is about 0.39, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I messed up the formula for T_eq.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A)/4 )^0.5.\n\nWait, no, maybe the correct formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5.\n\nWait, let me think. The equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_eq = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a\u00b2) ) ]^0.25\n\nBut L is the star's luminosity, which is given by L = 4 pi R_star\u00b2 sigma T_eff^4.\n\nSo substituting,\n\nT_eq = [ (4 pi R_star\u00b2 sigma T_eff^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a\u00b2) ) ]^0.25\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ ( R_star\u00b2 T_eff^4 (1 - A) ) / (4 a\u00b2) ) ]^0.25\n\n= [ ( R_star\u00b2 T_eff^4 (1 - A) ) / (4 a\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4)\n\n= ( R_star^2 )^(1/4) * ( T_eff^4 )^(1/4) * ( (1-A)/4 )^(1/4) * (1/a\u00b2)^(1/4)\n\n= R_star^(1/2) T_eff * ( (1-A)/4 )^(1/4) * (1/a)^(1/2)\n\nSo,\n\nT_eq = T_eff * sqrt( R_star/(a) ) * ( (1-A)/4 )^(1/4 )\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the distance and the star's characteristics.\n\nAlternatively, I've seen the formula written as T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5.\n\nWait, but in any case, the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWhich is what I did earlier, giving T1/T2 \u22480.39.\n\nBut since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the square root of the inverse ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute T2/T1 instead.\n\nWait, the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So it's T1/T2.\n\nBut maybe I should have taken the inverse.\n\nWait, if a2 is smaller than a1, then Planet2 is closer. So it should be hotter than Planet1. So T2 > T1.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 would be less than 1. But the options don't have anything below 0.5 except option C (~0.53). Hmm, 0.53 is close to 0.5357, which is the cube of 0.81. Wait, no, 0.5357 is the cube of 0.81? Let me compute 0.81^3: 0.81 * 0.81 = 0.6561, *0.81 \u2248 0.5314. Yes, that's close to 0.5357.\n\nWait, so a2/a1 = (0.5357)^3 \u22480.1535.\n\nWait, but sqrt(a2/a1) is sqrt(0.1535)\u22480.3918.\n\nBut option C is ~0.53, which is sqrt( (a2/a1) )? No, because 0.53^2 is 0.2809, which is not close to 0.1535.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the ratio backward. Let me think again: T_eq is proportional to sqrt(1/a), so T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a1), T2 to 1/sqrt(a2).\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWe have a2 =0.1535 a1.\n\nSo sqrt(0.1535) \u22480.3918.\n\nBut if I accidentally took a1/a2, then sqrt( a1/a2 )= sqrt(1/0.1535)=sqrt(6.518)\u22482.55.\n\nBut the options don't have that either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K1 and K2.\n\nWait, the problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5, and Planet2 induces a shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5 in the same line.\n\nSo, for each planet, the Doppler shift is given by:\n\nv = c * (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb )\n\nWhere c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s.\n\nSo for Planet1:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.03 \u00c5, \u03bb=6300 \u00c5.\n\nv1 = 3e5 km/s * (0.03/6300) \u2248 3e5 * 4.7619e-6 \u2248 1.42857 km/s.\n\nSimilarly, Planet2:\n\n\u0394\u03bb=0.04 \u00c5.\n\nv2=3e5 * (0.04/6300) \u2248 3e5 *6.349e-6 \u2248 1.90476 km/s.\n\nSo K1=1.4286 km/s, K2=1.9048 km/s. So K1/K2=0.75.\n\nEarlier steps seem correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider that the RV shift is the same as the semi-amplitude K, but perhaps I forgot to consider that the mass function depends on (M_p^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ), but since M_p is much less than M_star, it's approximately (M_p^3 )/( M_star^2 )\n\nSo, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( a^(1/3) )\n\nSo, K1 = k * M1 / a1^(1/3)\n\nK2 = k * M2 / a2^(1/3)\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/3) ) / ( M2 a1^(1/3) )\n\nWhich gives:\n\n0.75 = (7 a2^(1/3)) / (5 a1^(1/3) )\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 a1^(1/3):\n\n3.75 a1^(1/3) =7 a2^(1/3)\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\n(3.75/7) a1^(1/3) = a2^(1/3)\n\n(3.75/7)=0.5357.\n\nSo,\n\na2^(1/3) = 0.5357 a1^(1/3)\n\nCube both sides:\n\na2 = (0.5357)^3 a1 \u22480.1535 a1.\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nHmm, so the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a1)=0.3918. No option matches.\n\nBut wait, the star's radius is 1.2 solar radii. Maybe I should include that in the equilibrium temperature formula.\n\nWait, the formula I used earlier was T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )\n\nBut perhaps the correct formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5.\n\nWait, but when considering the star's luminosity, L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_eff^4.\n\nSo, the equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_eff * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5.\n\nAh, wait! I think I forgot the (1-A)^0.5 factor in the previous ratio. But since both planets have the same albedo, that factor is the same for both and cancels out in the ratio. So the ratio T1/T2 would still be sqrt( a2/(a1) ), because the (1-A) terms cancel.\n\nWait, no, because (1-A) is the same for both, so (1-A)^0.5 is same, so when taking the ratio T1/T2, it's sqrt(R/(2a1)) / sqrt(R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 ), same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think that the star's radius doesn't affect the ratio, since it's the same for both planets. So the ratio remains sqrt( a2/a1 )=0.3918.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the RV method gives the mass function, not the actual mass. But since both planets are around the same star and we can assume i=90 degrees, perhaps the masses are correct as given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the Doppler shift formula differently. Because the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5 is being observed, but perhaps the star's own spectrum lines are at 6300 \u00c5, so the shift is measured relative to that. So the calculation of velocity from \u0394\u03bb is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the star's actual rotation or other factors cause the line to be at 6300 \u00c5. Hmm, perhaps not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the velocity of the star, which is 2\u03c0 a (M_p/(M_star))^(1/3) / P^(1/3) ) / c.\n\nBut I think I'm going in circles.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the formula for equilibrium temperature. Let me double-check.\n\nThe correct formula for equilibrium temperature when the planet has an albedo A is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5.\n\nWait, but some sources say the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5.\n\nSo, the ratio would be sqrt( a2/a1 ), as before.\n\nWait, but if the answer isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the Doppler shifts are given in terms of the star's velocity, but in reality, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula for K in terms of the planet's mass and semi-major axis is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi ) / (P) )^(1/3) ) / c\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star.\n\nSo,\n\nK = ( ( G M_p )^(1/3) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_star )\n\nSo,\n\nP = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3 / ( G M_star )) )^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting P into K:\n\nK = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( ( G M_star )^(1/6) ) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) a^(-1/2) )\n\nSimplifying:\n\nK = (G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) (2 pi )^(1/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ) ) / ( c M_star^(2/3) (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) a^(1/2) )\n\nCombine the G terms: G^(1/3 +1/6) = G^(1/2)\n\nM_star terms: M_star^(1/6 -2/3) = M_star^(-1/2)\n\nSo,\n\nK = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( c (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) )\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n(2 pi )^(1/3) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) ) = [ (2 pi )^2 / 4 pi\u00b2 ]^(1/6) ) = [ (4 pi\u00b2 ) / (4 pi\u00b2) ) ]^(1/6) )=1.\n\nWait, let me compute it correctly.\n\n(2 pi )^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3)\n\n(4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) = (2\u00b2 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) )= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\n(2 pi )^(1/3) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) ) = [ 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ] / [ 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ) ] =1.\n\nSo K simplifies to:\n\nK = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )\n\n= ( G M_p )^(1/2) / ( c M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )\n\n= ( G M_p / ( c\u00b2 M_star a ) )^(1/2 )\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just accept that K is proportional to (M_p) / ( a^(1/2) )\n\nWait, from the expression above, K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )\n\nSo,\n\nK \u221d M_p^(1/3) / ( a^(1/2) )\n\nSo, K1/K2 = ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * ( a2^(1/2) / a1^(1/2) )\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = ( (7/5)^(1/3) ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nWe have K1/K2=0.75.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = (7/5)^(1/3) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nCompute (7/5)^(1/3) \u2248 (1.4)^(0.333) \u2248 1.119.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = 1.119 * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 /1.119 \u22480.670.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = (0.670)^2 \u22480.4489.\n\nSo, a2 =0.4489 a1.\n\nNow, equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(0.4489)=0.67.\n\nBut this is still not matching any of the options. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another way to relate the RV shifts to the semi-major axes.\n\nAnother approach: The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is related to the planet's mass and the distance a. The formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / (P ) )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P\u00b2 = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3) / ( G M_star )\n\nSo P = (4 pi\u00b2 a\u00b3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nSubstituting into K:\n\nK = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( G M_star )^(1/6) ) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) a^(-3/2) )\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated, but let's try.\n\nSo,\n\nK = [ (G M_p )^(1/3) (2 pi )^(1/3) ) * ( G M_star )^(1/6) ) ] / [ c M_star^(2/3) (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) a^(3/2) ) ]\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nG: (1/3 +1/6) = 1/2\n\nM_p: 1/3\n\nM_star: (1/6 - 2/3) = (1/6 -4/6 )= -3/6 = -1/2\n\nSo,\n\nK = [ G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) (2 pi )^(1/3) ) ] / [ c (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) M_star^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) ]\n\nNow, simplifying the constants:\n\n(2 pi )^(1/3) / (4 pi\u00b2 )^(1/6) ) = (2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ) / (2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ) ) =1.\n\nSo,\n\nK = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) )\n\nSo,\n\nK \u221d ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( a^(3/2) )\n\nWhich can be written as K \u221d M_p^(1/3) a^(-3/2)\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = ( (M1^(1/3) ) / a1^(3/2) ) ) / ( (M2^(1/3) ) / a2^(3/2) ) )\n\n= ( M1^(1/3) a2^(3/2) ) / ( M2^(1/3) a1^(3/2) )\n\n= ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * ( a2/a1 )^(3/2 )\n\nWe have K1/K2=0.75.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = ( (7/5)^(1/3) ) * ( a2/a1 )^(3/2 )\n\nCompute (7/5)^(1/3)= approx 1.4^(0.333)= approx 1.119.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = 1.119 * (a2/a1 )^(3/2 )\n\nDivide both sides by 1.119:\n\n0.75 /1.119 \u22480.670 = (a2/a1 )^(3/2 )\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 2/3:\n\n(0.670)^(2/3) = a2/a1.\n\nCompute 0.670^(2/3):\n\nFirst, ln(0.670)= approx -0.4005.\n\nMultiply by 2/3: -0.267.\n\nExponentiate: e^(-0.267)\u22480.766.\n\nSo, a2/a1\u22480.766.\n\nSo,\n\na2=0.766 a1.\n\nNow, equilibrium temperature ratio:\n\nT_eq \u221d sqrt(1/a), so T1/T2= sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(0.766 ) \u22480.875.\n\nHmm, but this is still not matching any options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the exponent handling.\n\nWait, if K \u221d M_p^(1/3) a^(-3/2), then K1/K2 = (M1^(1/3) a2^(-3/2) ) / ( M2^(1/3) a1^(-3/2) ) )\n\n= ( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * ( a1/a2 )^(3/2 )\n\nSo,\n\n0.75= (1.4^(1/3)) * ( a1/a2 )^(3/2 )\n\nWhich is 0.75=1.119 * (a1/a2 )^(3/2 )\n\nSo,\n\n(a1/a2 )^(3/2 )= 0.75/1.119\u22480.670.\n\nTake both sides to the power of 2/3:\n\na1/a2 = (0.670)^(2/3) \u22480.670^(0.6667)=approx 0.866.\n\nSo,\n\na1=0.866 a2.\n\nWhich implies a2= a1 /0.866\u22481.155 a1.\n\nWait, that can't be right because Planet2's RV shift is larger, implying it's closer.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct proportionality is K \u221d (M_p) / (a^(1/2) )\n\nWait, from the earlier approach, I think I got conflicting results, which suggests that perhaps I should look for another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that K is proportional to (M_p) / (a^(1/2) ), which would make K1/K2 = (M1 a2^(1/2) ) / ( M2 a1^(1/2) )\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = (7 a2^(1/2) ) / (5 a1^(1/2) )\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 a1^(1/2):\n\n3.75 a1^(1/2) =7 a2^(1/2)\n\nDivide both sides by7:\n\n0.5357 a1^(1/2) =a2^(1/2)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\na2= (0.5357)^2 a1=0.287 a1.\n\nSo a2=0.287 a1.\n\nNow, T1/T2= sqrt( a2/a1 )=sqrt(0.287)=0.536.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.536, which is close to option C (~0.53).\n\nAh! So the ratio is approximately 0.53.\n\nSo the answer would be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by using the formula for equilibrium temperature:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{eq}} = T_{\\text{star}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1 - A}{4}\\right)^{0.5}\n\\]\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo (\\(A\\)), the \\(\\left(\\frac{1 - A}{4}\\right)^{0.5}\\) term cancels out in the ratio.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it absorbs and emits. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature involves the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out or stays the same for both.\n\nThe formula, as I recall, is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is albedo. Since A is the same for both planets, that part will be the same for both, so it won't affect the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures will depend on sqrt(R_star/(2a)) for each planet, which means the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt(a2/(a1)) )^something? Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, each planet's equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of their orbital distance. Because T is proportional to (L/(16\u03c0\u03c3 a\u00b2 (1-A)))^1/4. But L, the star's luminosity, depends on R_star\u00b2 and T_star^4, right? Because L = 4\u03c0R^2 \u03c3 T^4. So substituting that into T_planet's formula:\n\nT_planet = (L/(16\u03c0\u03c3 a\u00b2 (1-A)) )^(1/4) = ( (4\u03c0 R_star^2 \u03c3 T_star^4) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2 (1 - A)) )^(1/4 )\n\nSimplify that: The 4\u03c0 cancels with 16\u03c0 as 4/16 = 1/4. So:\n\n= ( R_star^2 T_star^4 / (4 a\u00b2 (1 - A)) )^(1/4 )\n\nWhich is R_star^(1/2) * T_star * a^(-1/2) * (1/(4(1-A)))^(1/4)\n\nWait, wait, maybe a better way: Let me think about the equilibrium temperature formula. The standard formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where T_s is the star's effective temperature, R_s is its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance.\n\nSo for Planet 1 and Planet 2, their equilibrium temperatures would be T1 = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2 a1)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nSimilarly, T2 = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2 a2)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because when you take T1 over T2, the T_s and (1-A) terms cancel out. So ratio = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, no: because T1 is proportional to sqrt( R_s / (2 a1) ), and T2 is proportional to sqrt( R_s / (2 a2) ). So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_s/(2 a1)) / (R_s/(2 a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Let me write it out:\n\nT1 = k * sqrt(R_s / a1 )\n\nT2 = k * sqrt(R_s / a2 )\n\nWhere k is all the other constants (including T_s and (1-A)^(1/4) and so on). So T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_s/a1) / (R_s/a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nYes, that's right. So the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1). So I need to find the ratio of a2 to a1, and then take the square root of that.\n\nSo how do I find a1 and a2? The question gives data about the Doppler shifts caused by each planet. The RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )\n\nBut since the planets are much less massive than the star, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star, so K \u2248 (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) c )^(1/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and orbital period. Also, the transit method gives the size of the planet, which relates to its density and hence, perhaps, its mass.\n\nWait, but the problem gives us the Doppler shifts for each planet. For Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 \u00c5, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 \u00c5. Oh, but wait, the shifts are given in terms of the same forbidden line at 6300 \u00c5. So the RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity shift, which is the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is equal to v/c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us.\n\nSo, the Doppler shift is given by \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v / c. So v = c * (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb)\n\nWait, but the forbidden line is at 6300 \u00c5. So for Planet1, the shift is 0.03 \u00c5. So \u0394\u03bb = 0.03 \u00c5, \u03bb = 6300 \u00c5. So the velocity is v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly for Planet2, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.\n\nWait, but wait, that's correct only if the shift is small, which it is because 0.03/6300 is like 5e-6, so v would be a fraction of the speed of light.\n\nBut the RV semi-amplitude K is the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. So K = (v1) for Planet1 and K2 = v2 for Planet2.\n\nBut wait, I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G * P ) / (2 \u03c0 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) )\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to K \u2248 ( ( G * P ) / (2 \u03c0 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )\n\nBut since the planets have the same star, M_star is the same for both. So K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( P^(1/3) )\n\nAlternatively, another formula I remember is that K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P c)) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Perhaps a better approach is to realize that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut without knowing the orbital periods, this might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio of the planetary masses and the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes to find the ratio of their orbital periods, and thus their distances.\n\nWait, but wait, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is related to the mass and the period. But without knowing the period, perhaps we can relate the velocities to the masses and the distances.\n\nWait, another approach. The Doppler shift is K = (v_star) = (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)\n\nBut if I can't find P, maybe I can find the ratio of a1 and a2 using Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law says that P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 G M_star )^(-1) a^3. So P = 2\u03c0 (a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nWait, more accurately, P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/( G M_star )\n\nSo, P = sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / ( G M_star ) )\n\nBut I can express the RV semi-amplitude K in terms of a and P.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Since both planets are detected via RV, and their K values are given (0.03 and 0.04 \u00c5), which correspond to their velocities. Let me compute v1 and v2.\n\nv1 = (0.03 \u00c5) / (6300 \u00c5) * c\n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04/6300) * c\n\nBut c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s. So:\n\nv1 = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e5 km/s = (3e5 * 0.03) / 6300 km/s\n\nCompute numerator: 3e5 * 0.03 = 9e3.\n\n9e3 / 6300 \u2248 1.4286 km/s.\n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04 /6300) *3e5 = (3e5 * 0.04)/6300 = 1.2e4 /6300 \u2248 1.9048 km/s.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Let me compute 0.03/6300:\n\n0.03 /6300 = 3e-5 /6.3e3 = 3e-5 /6.3e3 = approximately 4.76e-9. Multiply by c, which is about 3e5 km/s, gives v = 4.76e-9 * 3e5 = 1.428e-3 km/s, which is 1.428 mm/s. Hmm, that seems small, but I think that's correct. Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in units. Because 1 \u00c5 is 1e-10 meters, so 0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-12 meters. But wait, the formula for Doppler shift is (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) = v/c, so v = c*(\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb)\n\nSo, let me compute v1 correctly:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.03 \u00c5 = 0.03e-10 m\n\n\u03bb = 6300 \u00c5 = 6300e-10 m\n\nv1 = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c = (0.03e-10 / 6300e-10) * 3e8 m/s\n\nSimplify: 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-5 / 6.3e3 = approximately 4.76e-9.\n\nMultiply by c (3e8 m/s): 4.76e-9 * 3e8 = 1.428 m/s.\n\nWait, that's about 1.428 m/s for v1.\n\nSimilarly, v2 is 0.04 /6300 = 4e-5 /6.3e3 = approximately 6.349e-9.\n\nv2 = 6.349e-9 *3e8 = 1.9047e0 m/s, so approximately 1.905 m/s.\n\nSo K1 is 1.428 m/s and K2 is 1.905 m/s.\n\nNow, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 \u03c0 ) / (P c^3 ) )^(1/3) )^(1/3)\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula:\n\nK = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P c)) )^(1/3)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation between K, planet mass, and orbital period.\n\nAnother approach: using the fact that for a circular orbit, the star's velocity is K = (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) c ) )\n\nBut without knowing the period, perhaps I can relate the two planets.\n\nWait, let's denote M_p1 and M_p2 as the masses of Planet1 and Planet2. We know M_p1 =7 Earth masses, M_p2=5 Earth masses.\n\nSo, K1 = ( (2 \u03c0 G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p1 sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p1 )^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1/( P1 c ) )^(1/3 )\n\nSimilarly for K2.\n\nBut since both planets are around the same star, M_star is same, and sin i is probably the same (assuming same inclination, which I think we can assume because both are detected via RV, so i is roughly 90 degrees, so sin i \u22481 for both).\n\nSo, K1 / K2 = [ ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (M_star + M_p1 )^(-2/3) / (M_star + M_p2 )^(-2/3) ) ) * ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ) ]\n\nBut since M_p1 and M_p2 are much less than M_star (1.5 solar masses), M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So, (M_star + M_p1 )^(-2/3) \u2248 M_star^(-2/3), same for M_p2. So that term cancels out.\n\nSo, K1/K2 \u2248 (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nBut I don't know P1 and P2. Hmm. But from Kepler's third law, P^2 \u221d a^3/(M_star).\n\nSo, P1^2 / P2^2 = (a1^3 / a2^3 ) * ( M_star2 / M_star1 )\n\nWait, but M_star is same for both, so:\n\nP1^2 / P2^2 = (a1^3 / a2^3 )\n\nSo, (P2/P1 ) = (a2^3 / a1^3 )^(1/2 )\n\nSo, (P2/P1 )^(1/3 ) = (a2^3 / a1^3 )^(1/6 ) = (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )\n\nSo substituting back into the K ratio:\n\nK1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(1/2) )\n\nBut K1 and K2 are given as 1.428 m/s and 1.905 m/s, so K1/K2 \u2248 1.428 / 1.905 \u2248 0.75.\n\nSo, 0.75 \u2248 (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nBecause M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses. So 7/5 is 1.4.\n\nSo, 0.75 \u2248 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nWait, let me compute 7/5=1.4, yes.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 0.75 / 1.4 \u2248 0.5357\n\nThen, square both sides: a2/a1 \u2248 (0.5357)^2 \u2248 0.287.\n\nSo, a2 is about 0.287 times a1. Or a1 is about 3.48 times a2.\n\nWait, no, because a2/a1 = 0.287, so a1 = a2 / 0.287 \u2248 3.48 a2.\n\nBut wait, this would imply that Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2, since a1 is larger.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense if Planet1 induces a smaller RV shift. Wait, but K is higher for Planet2, which has a higher mass and is closer, perhaps. But according to our calculation, a2 is about 28.7% of a1, so a1 is larger.\n\nWait, but let's proceed. Now, the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), as we had earlier.\n\nWait, no, earlier we found that T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nBecause T1 = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2a1) ), T2 = same formula with a2. So the ratio is sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. Earlier I found that T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause T_p is proportional to sqrt( R_s/(a) ), so for each planet, T1 = k * sqrt(1/a1 ), T2 = k * sqrt(1/a2 ), so T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nYes.\n\nSo, a2/a1 \u2248 0.287, so sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 is 0.536, which is approximately 0.536. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCompute K1/K2: 1.428 / 1.905 \u2248 0.75.\n\nM_p1=7, M_p2=5. So 7/5=1.4.\n\nSo 0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.75 /1.4 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo a2/a1 \u2248 (0.5357)^2 \u2248 0.287.\n\nThus, a2 is about 28.7% of a1.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536.\n\nSo the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is about 0.536 times that of Planet2, so the ratio is approximately 0.53. So the correct option is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it absorbs and emits. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature involves the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out or stays the same for both.\n\nThe formula, as I recall, is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is albedo. Since A is the same for both planets, that part will be the same for both, so it won't affect the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures will depend on sqrt(R_star/(2a)) for each planet, which means the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt(a2/(a1)) )^something? Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, each planet's equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of their orbital distance. Because T is proportional to (L/(16\u03c0\u03c3 a\u00b2 (1-A)))^1/4. But L, the star's luminosity, depends on R_star\u00b2 and T_star^4, right? Because L = 4\u03c0R^2 \u03c3 T^4. So substituting that into T_planet's formula:\n\nT_planet = (L/(16\u03c0\u03c3 a\u00b2 (1-A)) )^(1/4) = ( (4\u03c0 R_star^2 \u03c3 T_star^4) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2 (1 - A)) )^(1/4 )\n\nSimplify that: The 4\u03c0 cancels with 16\u03c0 as 4/16 = 1/4. So:\n\n= ( R_star^2 T_star^4 / (4 a\u00b2 (1 - A)) )^(1/4 )\n\nWhich is R_star^(1/2) * T_star * a^(-1/2) * (1/(4(1-A)))^(1/4)\n\nWait, wait, maybe a better way: Let me think about the equilibrium temperature formula. The standard formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where T_s is the star's effective temperature, R_s is its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance.\n\nSo for Planet 1 and Planet 2, their equilibrium temperatures would be T1 = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2 a1)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nSimilarly, T2 = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2 a2)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because when you take T1 over T2, the T_s and (1-A) terms cancel out. So ratio = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, no: because T1 is proportional to sqrt( R_s / (2 a1) ), and T2 is proportional to sqrt( R_s / (2 a2) ). So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_s/(2 a1)) / (R_s/(2 a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Let me write it out:\n\nT1 = k * sqrt(R_s / a1 )\n\nT2 = k * sqrt(R_s / a2 )\n\nWhere k is all the other constants (including T_s and (1-A)^(1/4) and so on). So T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_s/a1) / (R_s/a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nYes, that's right. So the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1). So I need to find the ratio of a2 to a1, and then take the square root of that.\n\nSo how do I find a1 and a2? The question gives data about the Doppler shifts caused by each planet. The RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )\n\nBut since the planets are much less massive than the star, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star, so K \u2248 (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) c )^(1/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and orbital period. Also, the transit method gives the size of the planet, which relates to its density and hence, perhaps, its mass.\n\nWait, but the problem gives us the Doppler shifts for each planet. For Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 \u00c5, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 \u00c5. Oh, but wait, the shifts are given in terms of the same forbidden line at 6300 \u00c5. So the RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity shift, which is the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is equal to v/c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us.\n\nSo, the Doppler shift is given by \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v / c. So v = c * (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb)\n\nWait, but the forbidden line is at 6300 \u00c5. So for Planet1, the shift is 0.03 \u00c5. So \u0394\u03bb = 0.03 \u00c5, \u03bb = 6300 \u00c5. So the velocity is v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly for Planet2, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.\n\nWait, but wait, that's correct only if the shift is small, which it is because 0.03/6300 is like 5e-6, so v would be a fraction of the speed of light.\n\nBut the RV semi-amplitude K is the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. So K = (v1) for Planet1 and K2 = v2 for Planet2.\n\nBut wait, I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G * P ) / (2 \u03c0 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) )\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to K \u2248 ( ( G * P ) / (2 \u03c0 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )\n\nBut since the planets have the same star, M_star is the same for both. So K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( P^(1/3) )\n\nAlternatively, another formula I remember is that K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P c)) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Perhaps a better approach is to realize that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut without knowing the orbital periods, this might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio of the planetary masses and the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes to find the ratio of their orbital periods, and thus their distances.\n\nWait, but wait, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is related to the mass and the period. But without knowing the period, perhaps we can relate the velocities to the masses and the distances.\n\nWait, another approach. The Doppler shift is K = (v_star) = (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)\n\nBut if I can't find P, maybe I can find the ratio of a1 and a2 using Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law says that P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 G M_star )^(-1) a^3. So P = 2\u03c0 (a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )\n\nWait, more accurately, P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/( G M_star )\n\nSo, P = sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / ( G M_star ) )\n\nBut I can express the RV semi-amplitude K in terms of a and P.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Since both planets are detected via RV, and their K values are given (0.03 and 0.04 \u00c5), which correspond to their velocities. Let me compute v1 and v2.\n\nv1 = (0.03 \u00c5) / (6300 \u00c5) * c\n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04/6300) * c\n\nBut c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s. So:\n\nv1 = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e5 km/s = (3e5 * 0.03) / 6300 km/s\n\nCompute numerator: 3e5 * 0.03 = 9e3.\n\n9e3 / 6300 \u2248 1.4286 km/s.\n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04 /6300) *3e5 = (3e5 * 0.04)/6300 = 1.2e4 /6300 \u2248 1.9048 km/s.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Let me compute 0.03/6300:\n\n0.03 /6300 = 3e-5 /6.3e3 = 3e-5 /6.3e3 = approximately 4.76e-9. Multiply by c, which is about 3e5 km/s, gives v = 4.76e-9 * 3e5 = 1.428e-3 km/s, which is 1.428 mm/s. Hmm, that seems small, but I think that's correct. Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in units. Because 1 \u00c5 is 1e-10 meters, so 0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-12 meters. But wait, the formula for Doppler shift is (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) = v/c, so v = c*(\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb)\n\nSo, let me compute v1 correctly:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.03 \u00c5 = 0.03e-10 m\n\n\u03bb = 6300 \u00c5 = 6300e-10 m\n\nv1 = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c = (0.03e-10 / 6300e-10) * 3e8 m/s\n\nSimplify: 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-5 / 6.3e3 = approximately 4.76e-9.\n\nMultiply by c (3e8 m/s): 4.76e-9 * 3e8 = 1.428 m/s.\n\nWait, that's about 1.428 m/s for v1.\n\nSimilarly, v2 is 0.04 /6300 = 4e-5 /6.3e3 = approximately 6.349e-9.\n\nv2 = 6.349e-9 *3e8 = 1.9047e0 m/s, so approximately 1.905 m/s.\n\nSo K1 is 1.428 m/s and K2 is 1.905 m/s.\n\nNow, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 \u03c0 ) / (P c^3 ) )^(1/3) )^(1/3)\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula:\n\nK = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P c)) )^(1/3)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation between K, planet mass, and orbital period.\n\nAnother approach: using the fact that for a circular orbit, the star's velocity is K = (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) c ) )\n\nBut without knowing the period, perhaps I can relate the two planets.\n\nWait, let's denote M_p1 and M_p2 as the masses of Planet1 and Planet2. We know M_p1 =7 Earth masses, M_p2=5 Earth masses.\n\nSo, K1 = ( (2 \u03c0 G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p1 sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p1 )^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1/( P1 c ) )^(1/3 )\n\nSimilarly for K2.\n\nBut since both planets are around the same star, M_star is same, and sin i is probably the same (assuming same inclination, which I think we can assume because both are detected via RV, so i is roughly 90 degrees, so sin i \u22481 for both).\n\nSo, K1 / K2 = [ ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (M_star + M_p1 )^(-2/3) / (M_star + M_p2 )^(-2/3) ) ) * ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ) ]\n\nBut since M_p1 and M_p2 are much less than M_star (1.5 solar masses), M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So, (M_star + M_p1 )^(-2/3) \u2248 M_star^(-2/3), same for M_p2. So that term cancels out.\n\nSo, K1/K2 \u2248 (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nBut I don't know P1 and P2. Hmm. But from Kepler's third law, P^2 \u221d a^3/(M_star).\n\nSo, P1^2 / P2^2 = (a1^3 / a2^3 ) * ( M_star2 / M_star1 )\n\nWait, but M_star is same for both, so:\n\nP1^2 / P2^2 = (a1^3 / a2^3 )\n\nSo, (P2/P1 ) = (a2^3 / a1^3 )^(1/2 )\n\nSo, (P2/P1 )^(1/3 ) = (a2^3 / a1^3 )^(1/6 ) = (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )\n\nSo substituting back into the K ratio:\n\nK1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(1/2) )\n\nBut K1 and K2 are given as 1.428 m/s and 1.905 m/s, so K1/K2 \u2248 1.428 / 1.905 \u2248 0.75.\n\nSo, 0.75 \u2248 (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nBecause M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses. So 7/5 is 1.4.\n\nSo, 0.75 \u2248 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nWait, let me compute 7/5=1.4, yes.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 0.75 / 1.4 \u2248 0.5357\n\nThen, square both sides: a2/a1 \u2248 (0.5357)^2 \u2248 0.287.\n\nSo, a2 is about 0.287 times a1. Or a1 is about 3.48 times a2.\n\nWait, no, because a2/a1 = 0.287, so a1 = a2 / 0.287 \u2248 3.48 a2.\n\nBut wait, this would imply that Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2, since a1 is larger.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense if Planet1 induces a smaller RV shift. Wait, but K is higher for Planet2, which has a higher mass and is closer, perhaps. But according to our calculation, a2 is about 28.7% of a1, so a1 is larger.\n\nWait, but let's proceed. Now, the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), as we had earlier.\n\nWait, no, earlier we found that T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nBecause T1 = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2a1) ), T2 = same formula with a2. So the ratio is sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. Earlier I found that T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause T_p is proportional to sqrt( R_s/(a) ), so for each planet, T1 = k * sqrt(1/a1 ), T2 = k * sqrt(1/a2 ), so T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nYes.\n\nSo, a2/a1 \u2248 0.287, so sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 is 0.536, which is approximately 0.536. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCompute K1/K2: 1.428 / 1.905 \u2248 0.75.\n\nM_p1=7, M_p2=5. So 7/5=1.4.\n\nSo 0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.75 /1.4 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nSo a2/a1 \u2248 (0.5357)^2 \u2248 0.287.\n\nThus, a2 is about 28.7% of a1.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536.\n\nSo the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is about 0.536 times that of Planet2, so the ratio is approximately 0.53. So the correct option is C.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:\n\n\\[\nT_p = T_s \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_s}{2a}} \\cdot \\left(1 - A\\right)^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(T_s\\) is the star's effective temperature, \\(R_s\\) is the star's radius, \\(a\\) is the planet's orbital distance, and \\(A\\) is the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo (\\(A\\)), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio depends on the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances.\n\n### Step 1: Determine Orbital Distances\nThe orbital distances (\\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\)) are related to the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes (\\(K_1\\) and \\(K_2\\)) via the formula:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{(2\\pi G)^{1/3}}{(M_s + M_p)^{2/3}} \\cdot \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{c} \\cdot \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(M_s\\) is the star's mass, \\(M_p\\) is the planet's mass, \\(P\\) is the orbital period, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light. Since both planets orbit the same star, \\(M_s\\) and \\(c\\) are constant. Assuming \\(M_p \\ll M_s\\), the formula simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nK \\propto \\frac{M_p}{P^{1/3}}\n\\]\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, \\(P^2 \\propto a^3 / M_s\\), so \\(P^{1/3} \\propto a^{1/2}\\). Substituting this into the RV formula gives:\n\n\\[\nK \\propto \\frac{M_p}{a^{1/2}}\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{M_p1}{M_p2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(\\sqrt{a_2 / a_1}\\)\nThe RV semi-amplitudes are given as \\(K_1 = 1.428 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) and \\(K_2 = 1.905 \\, \\text{m/s}\\). The planet masses are \\(M_p1 = 7 \\, M_\\oplus\\) and \\(M_p2 = 5 \\, M_\\oplus\\). Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{7}{5} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1.428}{1.905} = 1.4 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.75 = 1.4 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\frac{0.75}{1.4} \\approx 0.5357\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\approx (0.5357)^2 \\approx 0.287\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Temperature Ratio\nThe equilibrium temperature ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.287} \\approx 0.536\n\\]\n\nThus, the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is approximately 0.536 times that of Planet2.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is closest to **0.53**.\n\n**Answer: C**",
