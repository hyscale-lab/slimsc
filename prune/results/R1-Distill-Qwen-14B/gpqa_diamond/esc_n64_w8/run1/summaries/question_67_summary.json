      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nThe problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l=1. So each electron has l1 and l2 equal to 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, I need to remember what these quantum numbers mean. Oh right, the state is written as |l1, l2, L, M>, where L is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and M is its z-component.\n\nSo the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We're to find the joint probability that both measurements yield -\u0127. \n\nWait, L1z and L2z are the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum. Each of these has possible eigenvalues m1\u0127 and m2\u0127, where m can be -1, 0, +1 for each electron because they're in p orbitals (l=1). \n\nBut wait, the total state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. So I think this is a state where the two electrons' angular momenta are coupled to a total L=2 and M=-1. \n\nThe joint state must be a combination of the possible states of the individual electrons. But how does that relate to the individual m1 and m2 values?\n\nI remember that when combining angular momenta, the total M is the sum of m1 and m2. So M = m1 + m2. In this case, M is given as -1. So m1 + m2 = -1. But wait, the problem says we're to find the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -\u0127. So that would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, because L1z = m1 \u0127, so if the measurement is -\u0127, m1 is -1. Similarly for m2.\n\nBut if both m1 and m2 are -1, then M = (-1) + (-1) = -2. But the state given has M = -1. So that's a problem. Because the state is |... M=-1>, so the sum of m1 and m2 must be -1. But if each is -1, their sum is -2, which doesn't match M=-1. So how can that happen?\n\nWait, that suggests that the state |1,1,2,-1> can't have both electrons in m=-1 states. Because in that case, the M would be -2, which doesn't match. So the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero. Because the state can't have that combination.\n\nBut wait, I should think more carefully. The state |l1, l2, L, M> is a specific state in the coupled basis. It's a combination of the product states of the individual m's. So to find the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1, I need to express the coupled state in terms of the product states.\n\nWait, the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> can be expanded in terms of the product states |m1, m2>. The coefficients will tell me the probability amplitudes for each possible (m1, m2) pair.\n\nSo, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a member of the L=2 multiplet. How do we find the expansion of this state?\n\nI remember that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play here. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients allow us to express the coupled states in terms of the individual m states.\n\nThe general expansion is something like:\n\n|l1, l2, L, M> = sum_{m1, m2} [ <m1, m2 | L, M> ] |m1, m2>\n\nwhere <m1, m2 | L, M> are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nSo for our case, l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.\n\nThe possible m1 and m2 values must satisfy m1 + m2 = M = -1. So m1 can range from -1 to +1, as can m2, but their sum must be -1.\n\nSo the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:\n\n(-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -2) but wait, wait, m can't be less than -l, which is -1 for l=1. So m2 can't be -2. So only (-1,0) and (0,-1) are possible.\n\nWait, wait, m1 can be -1,0,1. Similarly for m2. So for M = -1, m1 + m2 = -1.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\nm1 = -1, m2 = 0 \u2192 sum -1\nm1 = 0, m2 = -1 \u2192 sum -1\nm1 = 1, m2 = -2 \u2192 but m2 can't be -2 because l=1, so m2 must be \u2265 -1. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo only two possible (m1, m2) pairs: (-1,0) and (0,-1).\n\nSo the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these two product states.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for each of these will determine the amplitude.\n\nWait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta l1=1 and l2=1 to get L=2 and M=-1.\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( (1)(2+1)/( (2)(2+1)(2-1+1) ) ) ) [ |1,-1> + | -1,1> ] ?\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The general formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M is:\n\n< l1 m1, l2 m2 | L M > = Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\nIn our case, L=2, M=-1. l1 = l2 =1.\n\nSo for M=-1, the possible (m1, m2) are (-1,0) and (0,-1).\n\nThe coefficient for each is sqrt( ( (2 +1 - (0 +1) ) / (2+1) ) ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look up the specific CG coefficient.\n\nI think for two p orbitals (l=1 each) coupling to L=2, the state |2, -1> is a combination of |1,-1> and |1,0> in a certain way.\n\nWait, another approach: for L=2, M=-1, the state is a combination of m1= -1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.\n\nThe CG coefficient for |1,1,2,-1> would be something like:\n\nsqrt( (2 +1)/( (2)(2+1) ) ) * [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ] ?\n\nWait, I think the general formula for CG coefficients when combining two angular momenta l1 and l2 to L:\n\nThe coefficient for m1 and m2 is:\n\nsqrt( [ (L + m1 + m2) choose (l1 + m1, l2 + m2) ] ) / something.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is to think about the possible states. For L=2, M=-1, the possible m1 and m2 values are -1 and 0, and 0 and -1.\n\nThe CG coefficient for |m1, m2> in |L, M> is given by:\n\n< m1, m2 | L, M> = [ ( (2m1 + 2m2 - L + 1) ) ... ] Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should just look for a table or the general expression.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for two p orbitals (l=1 each), the possible L values are 0, 1, 2. For each L, the states are built from the possible m1 and m2 combinations that sum to M.\n\nFor L=2 and M=-2: only (m1=-1, m2=-1).\n\nFor L=2 and M=-1: (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1).\n\nSo, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nThe coefficients can be found using the CG coefficients. For two l=1's coupling to L=2, the CG coefficients for M= -1 would be:\n\nThe coefficients are sqrt( ( (2)(2 + 1) ) / ( (1 + 1)(2 + 1) ) ) ) ?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about normalization. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1.\n\nSuppose the state is a sum of the two product states with equal coefficients. Then each would have a coefficient of 1/sqrt(2), so the probability for each would be 1/2.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me think. For two p orbitals, when combining to L=2, the state |2, -1> is symmetric in a way? Because swapping the two electrons would swap m1 and m2, but for M=-1, the two terms are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the state is symmetric under exchange of the two electrons, so the coefficients should be the same.\n\nSo the state would be (|m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the expansion is |1,1,2,-1> = (| -1,0 > + |0,-1 > ) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait, I think the CG coefficients for specific cases might differ. Let me think about the possible states for L=2, M=-1.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the state |1,1,2,-1> is a member of the L=2 multiplet. The possible m values are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. But the specific expansion for each m depends on the combination of m1 and m2.\n\nBut in any case, the point is that the state |1,1,2,-1> can only be expressed as a combination of the two product states (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1), each with equal amplitude, because the coefficients are the same due to symmetry.\n\nSo the probability amplitude for each of these product states is 1/sqrt(2), meaning the probability for each is (1/sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 1/2.\n\nWait, but in this expansion, neither of the terms has both m1 and m2 equal to -1. Because m1 can't be -1 and m2 can't be -1 at the same time because that would sum to M=-2, which is not our case.\n\nSo, the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't include any component where both m1 and m2 are -1. Therefore, the probability of measuring both m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero.\n\nSo when the question asks for the joint probability of getting L1z = -\u0127 and L2z = -\u0127, which corresponds to m1=-1 and m2=-1, the probability is zero because this state doesn't have any contribution from that product state.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) 0.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves two electrons in p orbitals with angular momentum quantum numbers $l_1 = l_2 = 1$. The coupled angular momentum state is given as $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$, where $l_1$ and $l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, $l$ is the total angular momentum quantum number, and $m$ is the z-component of the total angular momentum. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nTo solve this, we note that the total z-component of angular momentum is given by $M = m_1 + m_2$.

We're to find the joint probability that both measurements yield -\u0127. \n\nWait, L1z and L2z are the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum. Each of these has possible eigenvalues m1\u0127 and m2\u0127, where m can be -1, 0, +1 for each electron because they're in p orbitals (l=1). \n\nBut wait, the total state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. So I think this is a state where the two electrons' angular momenta are coupled to a total L=2 and M=-1. \n\nThe joint state must be a combination of the possible states of the individual electrons. But how does that relate to the individual m1 and m2 values?\n\nI remember that when combining angular momenta, the total M is the sum of m1 and m2. So M = m1 + m2. In this case, M is given as -1. So m1 + m2 = -1. But wait, the problem says we're to find the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -\u0127. So that would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, because L1z = m1 \u0127, so if the measurement is -\u0127, m1 is -1. Similarly for m2.\n\nBut if both m1 and m2 are -1, then M = (-1) + (-1) = -2. But the state given has M = -1. So that's a problem. Because the state is |... M=-1>, so the sum of m1 and m2 must be -1. But if each is -1, their sum is -2, which doesn't match M=-1. So how can that happen?\n\nWait, that suggests that the state |1,1,2,-1> can't have both electrons in m=-1 states. Because in that case, the M would be -2, which doesn't match. So the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero. Because the state can't have that combination.\n\nBut wait, I should think more carefully.

So to find the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1, I need to express the coupled state in terms of the product states.\n\nWait, the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> can be expanded in terms of the product states |m1, m2>. The coefficients will tell me the probability amplitudes for each possible (m1, m2) pair.\n\nSo, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a member of the L=2 multiplet.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients allow us to express the coupled states in terms of the individual m states.\n\nThe general expansion is something like:\n\n|l1, l2, L, M> = sum_{m1, m2} [ <m1, m2 | L, M> ] |m1, m2>\n\nwhere <m1, m2 | L, M> are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nSo for our case, l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.\n\nThe possible m1 and m2 values must satisfy m1 + m2 = M = -1. So m1 can range from -1 to +1, as can m2, but their sum must be -1.\n\nSo the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:\n\n(-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -2) but wait, wait, m can't be less than -l, which is -1 for l=1. So m2 can't be -2. So only (-1,0) and (0,-1) are possible.\n\nWait, wait, m1 can be -1,0,1. Similarly for m2. So for M = -1, m1 + m2 = -1.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\nm1 = -1, m2 = 0 \u2192 sum -1\nm1 = 0, m2 = -1 \u2192 sum -1\nm1 = 1, m2 = -2 \u2192 but m2 can't be -2 because l=1, so m2 must be \u2265 -1.

For L=2, M=-1, the possible m1 and m2 values are -1 and 0, and 0 and -1.\n\nThe CG coefficient for |m1, m2> in |L, M> is given by:\n\n< m1, m2 | L, M> = [ ( (2m1 + 2m2 - L + 1) ) ... ] Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should just look for a table or the general expression.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for two p orbitals (l=1 each), the possible L values are 0, 1, 2.

For two l=1's coupling to L=2, the CG coefficients for M= -1 would be:\n\nThe coefficients are sqrt( ( (2)(2 + 1) ) / ( (1 + 1)(2 + 1) ) ) ) ?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about normalization. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1.\n\nSuppose the state is a sum of the two product states with equal coefficients. Then each would have a coefficient of 1/sqrt(2), so the probability for each would be 1/2.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me think. For two p orbitals, when combining to L=2, the state |2, -1> is symmetric in a way? Because swapping the two electrons would swap m1 and m2, but for M=-1, the two terms are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the state is symmetric under exchange of the two electrons, so the coefficients should be the same.\n\nSo the state would be (|m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the expansion is |1,1,2,-1> = (| -1,0 > + |0,-1 > ) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait, I think the CG coefficients for specific cases might differ. Let me think about the possible states for L=2, M=-1.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the state |1,1,2,-1> is a member of the L=2 multiplet. The possible m values are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. But the specific expansion for each m depends on the combination of m1 and m2.\n\nBut in any case, the point is that the state |1,1,2,-1> can only be expressed as a combination of the two product states (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1), each with equal amplitude, because the coefficients are the same due to symmetry.\n\nSo the probability amplitude for each of these product states is 1/sqrt(2), meaning the probability for each is (1/sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 1/2.\n\nWait, but in this expansion, neither of the terms has both m1 and m2 equal to -1. Because m1 can't be -1 and m2 can't be -1 at the same time because that would sum to M=-2, which is not our case.\n\nSo, the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't include any component where both m1 and m2 are -1. Therefore, the probability of measuring both m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero.\n\nSo when the question asks for the joint probability of getting L1z = -\u0127 and L2z = -\u0127, which corresponds to m1=-1 and m2=-1, the probability is zero because this state doesn't have any contribution from that product state.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) 0.\n\n\nThe problem involves two electrons in p orbitals with angular momentum quantum numbers $l_1 = l_2 = 1$. The coupled angular momentum state is given as $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$, where $l_1$ and $l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, $l$ is the total angular momentum quantum number, and $m$ is the z-component of the total angular momentum. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nTo solve this, we note that the total z-component of angular momentum is given by $M = m_1 + m_2$. For the state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$, $M = -1$. Therefore, the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs must satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The valid combinations are:\n\n1. $m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0$\n2. $m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1$\n\nThe combination $m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1$ is invalid because it would give $M = -2$, which does not match the given $M = -1$. Thus, the state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ cannot include any component where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThe state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ is a linear combination of the valid $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs, specifically:\n\n\\[\n|1,1,2,-1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\\rangle + |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\\rangle \\right).\n\\]\n\nSince the state does not include the $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\\rangle$ term, the probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l\u2081, l\u2082, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l\u2081 and l\u2082 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. l is the total angular momentum quantum number, and m is the Z component of the total angular momentum.\n\nThe question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L\u2081z and L\u2082z and getting eigenvalues of -\u0127 each. So, each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is -\u0127.\n\nHmm, I remember that for angular momentum addition, the total angular momentum state is a combination of the individual states. Since each electron is in a p orbital, l\u2081 and l\u2082 are both 1. The total l is 2, which makes sense because 1+1=2.\n\nThe state is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so the total angular momentum J is l=2, and m is -1. So the state is an eigenstate of L\u00b2 and L_z.\n\nBut I'm supposed to find the probability that both L\u2081z and L\u2082z are -\u0127. Let's think about the possible m\u2081 and m\u2082 values. Each can be -1, 0, +1.\n\nThe combined state would have m = m\u2081 + m\u2082. In our case, the total m is -1. So m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -1.\n\nWe want both m\u2081 and m\u2082 to be -1. Because L_z eigenvalues are m\u0127, so for each electron, m\u2081=-1 and m\u2082=-1. Then the total m would be -2. But wait, the state here has m=-1. That's a problem because if both m's are -1, their sum is -2, which doesn't match the given state's m of -1.\n\nWait, that can't happen. So the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't include the possibility where both m\u2081 and m\u2082 are -1. So if I measure L\u2081z and L\u2082z and get -\u0127 each, that would mean m\u2081 = m\u2082 = -1, leading to m_total = -2. But our state is in the m=-1 subspace.\n\nSo the probability of getting both m\u2081 and m\u2082 as -1 is zero because the state doesn't have any component where m_total is -2. Because the state is |2,-1>, which is a component in the m=-1 part, not in m=-2.\n\nWait, let me think again. The state is |1,1,2,-1>, which is an eigenstate of L\u00b2 and L_z. But how is this state constructed from the product states of the individual electrons?\n\nIn the uncoupled basis, the state is a combination of |l\u2081,m\u2081> |l\u2082,m\u2082> such that m\u2081 + m\u2082 = m. So for m_total = -1, m\u2081 can be -1, 0, or +1, but m\u2082 has to be such that their sum is -1.\n\nWait, for the given state |1,1,2,-1>, which is in the coupled basis, when we express it in the uncoupled basis, it's a linear combination of |m\u2081, m\u2082> states where m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -1. The possible (m\u2081, m\u2082) pairs are (-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2, +1) but wait, wait, wait. Wait, m\u2081 and m\u2082 can't be less than -1 because each is from -1 to +1. So possible pairs are (-1,0), (0,-1), and (1,-2), but wait, m\u2082 can't be -2 because l\u2082 is 1, so m\u2082 can be -1,0,+1. So (1, -2) is not allowed because m\u2082 can't be -2. So only (-1,0) and (0,-1) are possible.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's see: for m_total = -1, m\u2081 can be -1, then m\u2082 would have to be 0. Or m\u2081=0, m\u2082=-1. Or m\u2081=1, m\u2082=-2 (but m\u2082 can't be -2, so this is invalid). So the only valid m\u2081 and m\u2082 pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> in the coupled basis can be expressed as a linear combination of |m\u2081,m\u2082> where m\u2081 and m\u2082 are those pairs.\n\nSo the state is a sum of |1, m\u2081> |2, m\u2082> terms, but wait, in this case, both are p orbitals, so it's |m\u2081> for electron 1 and |m\u2082> for electron 2. So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.\n\nSo in the uncoupled basis, it's something like a combination of |m1, m2> with m1 = -1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.\n\nWait, but how is the state |1,1,2,-1> expressed in terms of the product states?

Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the state |l1=1, m1=1> and |l2=1, m2=1> combine to give |L=2, M=2> with coefficient 1.\n\nFor M=1, the possible combinations are (m1=1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=1).

Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the general formula for CG coefficients when adding two angular momenta is:\n\n< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > = something involving square roots and products.\n\nWait, another approach: for adding two p orbitals (l=1 each) to get an L=2 state.\n\nThe possible M values for L=2 are -2, -1, 0, +1, +2.\n\nFor M=2: only (m1=1, m2=1), so CG coefficient is 1.\n\nFor M=1: the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (1,0) and (0,1). The coefficient is sqrt( (2(2+1) - (1)(1+1) ) ) / (something) ).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the pattern. I remember that for two p orbitals combining to make d orbitals (l=2), the coefficients can be determined.\n\nThe general formula for the CG coefficients when adding l1=1 and l2=1 to get L=2 is:\n\nFor M = 2: only (1,1), coefficient 1.\n\nFor M = 1: sqrt( (2*2 - 1*1) / (2*(2+1)) ) ) * ( |1,0> + |0,1> )? Wait, no, perhaps the coefficients are different.\n\nAlternatively, I think the CG coefficients for M=1 are (1/\u221a3) for each term.\n\nWait, let's think about the normalization.\n\nThe state |2,1> is a combination of |1,1> |1,0>, |1,0> |1,1>, and |1,-1> |1,2>, but wait, no, because m can't be beyond l. So for M=1, the possible pairs are (m1=1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=1).\n\nSo the state |1,1; 2,1> would be (|1,0> |1,1> + |1,1> |1,0> ) multiplied by a coefficient.\n\nWait, actually, I think the CG coefficient for M=1 is sqrt(2/3) times (|1,0> |0,1> + |0,1> |1,0> )? Not sure. Alternatively, I've read that the CG coefficients for adding two l=1 states to L=2 are:\n\nFor M=2: (1,1) \u2192 coefficient 1.\n\nFor M=1: (1,0) and (0,1) \u2192 coefficients sqrt(2/3) each, but wait, no, perhaps the state is (|1,0> |1,1> + |1,1> |1,0> ) multiplied by 1/sqrt(2), but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look up or recall that the CG coefficients for two l=1 states adding to L=2 are as follows:\n\n|2,2> = |1,1> |1,1> \u2192 coefficient 1.\n\n|2,1> = ( |1,0> |1,1> + |1,1> |1,0> ) / sqrt(2) ?\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1/sqrt(2) multiplied by (|1,0> |1,1> + |1,1> |1,0> ), but I'm not confident.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The state |1,1; 2,-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.\n\nSo m1 can be -1, m2=0; or m1=0, m2=-1.\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nThe CG coefficient for each term would determine the amplitude.\n\nThe CG coefficient for each term is given by:\n\n< m1 m2 | M > = sqrt( ( ( (L + m1 + m2)(L - m1 - m2) ) / ( (2L - l1 + m1)(2L + l1 + m1) ) ... ) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to remember that the CG coefficients for two l=1's combining into L=2 are as follows.\n\nFor M = -2: only (-1,-1) \u2192 coefficient 1.\n\nFor M = -1: (-1,0) and (0,-1). The CG coefficient is sqrt( (2*(2+1) - (1*(1+1) + 1*(1+1)) ) ) Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I think the state |2, -1> is ( | -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) multiplied by a coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the state is ( | -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) multiplied by sqrt(1/2).\n\nWait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients for M=-1 would be such that the state is ( | -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) multiplied by 1/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think about normalization.\n\nThe state |2, -1> would be a combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1. The possible (m1, m2) are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).\n\nSo the state is a linear combination of these two.\n\nAssuming the coefficients are the same for each, the state would be ( | -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) multiplied by a normalization factor.\n\nWhat's the normalization factor? Let's calculate it.\n\nThe inner product of the state with itself must be 1.\n\nSo ( |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a b^*) ) = 1.\n\nIf the state is (a | -1,0 > + b | 0,-1 > ), then the normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(ab*) ) = 1.\n\nBut if a = b, then it's |a|^2 (1 +1 + 2 Re(a^2) ) = 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let's just assume the state is ( | -1,0 > + |0,-1> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are sqrt( ( (L - m1)(L + m1 +1) ) ) / something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the CG coefficient for M=-1 is sqrt( ( (L + m1)(L + m1 +1) ) / ( (2L - l1 + m1)(2L + l1 + m1) ) )).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for the pattern. For the two electrons with l1=l2=1, the possible L can be 2 or 0. For each L, the M values vary.\n\nWait, perhaps for L=2, M=-1: the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nThe CG coefficients can be found using the formula:\n\n< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > = [ ( ( (2L +1) * sqrt( ( (L - m1)(L + m1 +1) ) ) ) ) / ( (sqrt( (2L - l1 + m1)(2L + l1 + m1) )) * (sqrt( (2L - l2 + m2)(2L + l2 + m2) )) )) ) ] * something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find the CG coefficient for M=-1.\n\nIn the case where l1=l2=1 and L=2, M=-1.\n\nThe possible pairs are (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1).\n\nThe CG coefficients for these two terms would be the same.\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> is ( |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ) multiplied by a normalization factor.\n\nWhat's the normalization factor?\n\nEach term's coefficient would have a magnitude of 1/sqrt(2), because there are two terms and they're symmetric.\n\nWait, because the state should be normalized, so the sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1.\n\nSo if each term is multiplied by (1/sqrt(2)), then (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 2 = 1/2 * 2 = 1. So yes, that works.\n\nSo the state is ( | -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The normalization factor would be 1/sqrt(2) because there are two terms, each contributing equally.\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> is ( | -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo now, the question is: when we measure L\u2081z and L\u2082z, what's the probability that both are -\u0127?\n\nEach L_z measurement gives m * \u0127. So to get L\u2081z = -\u0127, m\u2081 must be -1. Similarly for L\u2082z = -\u0127, m\u2082 must be -1.\n\nBut looking at the state, the possible terms are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nIn neither of these terms do both m\u2081 and m\u2082 equal -1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't have any component where m\u2081 = m\u2082 = -1.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring both L\u2081z and L\u2082z as -\u0127 is zero.\n\nSo the answer is D) 0.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states, with the coupled angular momentum state given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\\rangle$. Here, $l_1 = l_2 = 1$, $l = 2$, and $m = -1$. The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ for both electrons.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Angular Momentum Coupling**: The total angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ is a superposition of the uncoupled basis states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the $z$-components of the orbital angular momentum for the two electrons. The total $m$ is given by $m = m_1 + m_2$, and for $m = -1$, the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$.\n\n2. **State Expansion**: The state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ can be expressed in the uncoupled basis as:\n   \\[\n   |1,1,2,-1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\\rangle + |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   This shows that the state is a symmetric combination of the two valid $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs.\n\n3. **Measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$**: Measuring $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$ corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, the state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ does not include the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ pair because $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ in this case, which is inconsistent with the total $m = -1$ of the coupled state.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation**: Since the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ pair does not contribute to the state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$, the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe joint probability of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ for both electrons is **0**.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l\u2081, l\u2082, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l\u2081 and l\u2082 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. l is the total angular momentum quantum number, and m is the Z component of the total angular momentum.\n\nThe question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L\u2081z and L\u2082z and getting eigenvalues of -\u0127 each. So, each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is -\u0127.\n\nHmm, I remember that for angular momentum addition, the total angular momentum state is a combination of the individual states. Since each electron is in a p orbital, l\u2081 and l\u2082 are both 1. The total l is 2, which makes sense because 1+1=2.\n\nThe state is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so the total angular momentum J is l=2, and m is -1. So the state is an eigenstate of L\u00b2 and L_z.\n\nBut I'm supposed to find the probability that both L\u2081z and L\u2082z are -\u0127. Let's think about the possible m\u2081 and m\u2082 values. Each can be -1, 0, +1.\n\nThe combined state would have m = m\u2081 + m\u2082. In our case, the total m is -1. So m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -1.\n\nWe want both m\u2081 and m\u2082 to be -1. Because L_z eigenvalues are m\u0127, so for each electron, m\u2081=-1 and m\u2082=-1. Then the total m would be -2. But wait, the state here has m=-1. That's a problem because if both m's are -1, their sum is -2, which doesn't match the given state's m of -1.\n\nWait, that can't happen. So the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't include the possibility where both m\u2081 and m\u2082 are -1. So if I measure L\u2081z and L\u2082z and get -\u0127 each, that would mean m\u2081 = m\u2082 = -1, leading to m_total = -2.

The possible (m\u2081, m\u2082) pairs are (-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2, +1) but wait, wait, wait. Wait, m\u2081 and m\u2082 can't be less than -1 because each is from -1 to +1. So possible pairs are (-1,0), (0,-1), and (1,-2), but wait, m\u2082 can't be -2 because l\u2082 is 1, so m\u2082 can be -1,0,+1. So (1, -2) is not allowed because m\u2082 can't be -2. So only (-1,0) and (0,-1) are possible.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's see: for m_total = -1, m\u2081 can be -1, then m\u2082 would have to be 0. Or m\u2081=0, m\u2082=-1.

Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficients for M=-1 would be such that the state is ( | -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) multiplied by 1/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think about normalization.\n\nThe state |2, -1> would be a combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1. The possible (m1, m2) are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).\n\nSo the state is a linear combination of these two.\n\nAssuming the coefficients are the same for each, the state would be ( | -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) multiplied by a normalization factor.\n\nWhat's the normalization factor? Let's calculate it.\n\nThe inner product of the state with itself must be 1.\n\nSo ( |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a b^*) ) = 1.\n\nIf the state is (a | -1,0 > + b | 0,-1 > ), then the normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(ab*) ) = 1.\n\nBut if a = b, then it's |a|^2 (1 +1 + 2 Re(a^2) ) = 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let's just assume the state is ( | -1,0 > + |0,-1> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are sqrt( ( (L - m1)(L + m1 +1) ) ) / something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the CG coefficient for M=-1 is sqrt( ( (L + m1)(L + m1 +1) ) / ( (2L - l1 + m1)(2L + l1 + m1) ) )).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for the pattern. For the two electrons with l1=l2=1, the possible L can be 2 or 0. For each L, the M values vary.\n\nWait, perhaps for L=2, M=-1: the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nThe CG coefficients can be found using the formula:\n\n< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > = [ ( ( (2L +1) * sqrt( ( (L - m1)(L + m1 +1) ) ) ) ) / ( (sqrt( (2L - l1 + m1)(2L + l1 + m1) )) * (sqrt( (2L - l2 + m2)(2L + l2 + m2) )) )) ) ] * something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find the CG coefficient for M=-1.\n\nIn the case where l1=l2=1 and L=2, M=-1.\n\nThe possible pairs are (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1).\n\nThe CG coefficients for these two terms would be the same.\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> is ( |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ) multiplied by a normalization factor.\n\nWhat's the normalization factor?\n\nEach term's coefficient would have a magnitude of 1/sqrt(2), because there are two terms and they're symmetric.\n\nWait, because the state should be normalized, so the sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1.\n\nSo if each term is multiplied by (1/sqrt(2)), then (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 2 = 1/2 * 2 = 1. So yes, that works.\n\nSo the state is ( | -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The normalization factor would be 1/sqrt(2) because there are two terms, each contributing equally.\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> is ( | -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo now, the question is: when we measure L\u2081z and L\u2082z, what's the probability that both are -\u0127?\n\nEach L_z measurement gives m * \u0127. So to get L\u2081z = -\u0127, m\u2081 must be -1. Similarly for L\u2082z = -\u0127, m\u2082 must be -1.\n\nBut looking at the state, the possible terms are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nIn neither of these terms do both m\u2081 and m\u2082 equal -1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't have any component where m\u2081 = m\u2082 = -1.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring both L\u2081z and L\u2082z as -\u0127 is zero.\n\nSo the answer is D) 0.\n\n\nThe problem involves two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states, with the coupled angular momentum state given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\\rangle$. Here, $l_1 = l_2 = 1$, $l = 2$, and $m = -1$. The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ for both electrons.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Angular Momentum Coupling**: The total angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ is a superposition of the uncoupled basis states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the $z$-components of the orbital angular momentum for the two electrons. The total $m$ is given by $m = m_1 + m_2$, and for $m = -1$, the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$.\n\n2. **State Expansion**: The state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ can be expressed in the uncoupled basis as:\n   \\[\n   |1,1,2,-1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\\rangle + |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   This shows that the state is a symmetric combination of the two valid $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs.\n\n3. **Measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$**: Measuring $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$ corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, the state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ does not include the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ pair because $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ in this case, which is inconsistent with the total $m = -1$ of the coupled state.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation**: Since the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ pair does not contribute to the state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$, the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe joint probability of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ for both electrons is **0**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again.\n\nThe question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum for this problem. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron, and l and m are the total angular momentum quantum numbers for the system. \n\nThe question asks: If we measure the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron, what's the probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -\u0127?\n\nHmm. So, each electron has an orbital angular momentum L, and we're looking at their individual Lz components. The possible eigenvalues for Lz are m * \u0127, where m is the magnetic quantum number. But wait, in the state given, the electrons are in a coupled state with l=2, m=-1. So, I think I need to find the possible m1 and m2 values for each electron such that when combined, they give the total m of -1 and l of 2.\n\nWait, but the state is |1,1,2,-1>, right? So l1=1, l2=1. Each electron is in a p orbital, so l=1 for each. The total orbital angular momentum is l=2. And the magnetic quantum number for the total is m=-1.\n\nSo, the state is a coupled state of the two electrons. To find the possible m1 and m2 values, I should think about the addition of angular momenta. Each electron has m1 and m2, so m = m1 + m2. Here, the total m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.\n\nBut each electron can have m1 and m2 values of -1, 0, +1, since l=1 for each. So possible pairs for (m1, m2) that sum to -1 are:\n\n(-1, 0), (0, -1), (0,0?), wait no, 0+0=0, which isn't -1. Wait, wait, let's list all possible:\n\nm1 can be -1, 0, +1.\n\nm2 can be -1, 0, +1.\n\nSo all possible pairs and their sums:\n\n(-1, -1) \u2192 -2\n\n(-1, 0) \u2192 -1\n\n(-1, +1) \u2192 0\n\n(0, -1) \u2192 -1\n\n(0, 0) \u2192 0\n\n(0, +1) \u2192 +1\n\n(+1, -1) \u2192 0\n\n(+1, 0) \u2192 +1\n\n(+1, +1) \u2192 +2\n\nSo the pairs where m1 + m2 = -1 are (-1,0) and (0,-1).\n\nSo, in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the possible m1 and m2 combinations are those that sum to -1. Now, the state is a specific coupled state, so it's a linear combination of the uncoupled basis states. The uncoupled basis states are |m1, m2>, right? So the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> is a combination of all |m1, m2> states that can sum to m=-1, with appropriate coefficients.\n\nWait, but in this case, when the total l is 2, which is l1 + l2, the possible m values are from -l to +l, so from -2 to +2. But the state in question is m=-1. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific combination of the |m1, m2> states that sum to m=-1.\n\nBut how exactly? Let me think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For two p orbitals (l=1 each), combining to l=2. The Clebsch-Gordan expansion for |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m> would involve the possible |m1, m2> states that sum to m.\n\nSo, for m=-1, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these two states.\n\nThe coefficients can be found using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For two l=1 orbitals combining to l=2, the states are built from |m1, m2> as follows.\n\nWait, for l=2, m=2: only (1,1) contributes.\n\nFor m=1: (1,0) and (0,1) contribute.\n\nFor m=0: (1,-1), (0,0), (-1,1) contribute.\n\nFor m=-1: (-1,0), (0,-1) contribute.\n\nFor m=-2: (-1,-1) contributes.\n\nSo, for m=-1, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m= -1 in the l=2 state would have coefficients for these two components. The coefficients can be determined from the CG tables. For two spin-1 particles (since l=1), the CG coefficients for m=-1 in l=2 would be sqrt(1/6) for each of these states. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact value, but I know that the coefficients are normalized and symmetric.\n\nWait, for the state |1,1,2,-1>, the expansion is:\n\n|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt(1/6) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt(1/6) |m1=0, m2=-1> ?\n\nWait, I might be getting the signs wrong. Wait, another way: the state |l=2, m=-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. So, the possible terms are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nThe CG coefficient for each term is given by:\n\nsqrt( ( (j - m1)(j + m1 + 1) ) / ( (2j +1)(j + m)(j - m +1) ) ) )\n\nWait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I remember that for two spin-1 particles, the state |2, m> can be written as a sum of |m1, m2>.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of terms in the expansion is (2l +1) for each m. For l=2, each m has a certain number of terms.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to recall that the state |2, -1> is a sum of two terms with coefficients sqrt(1/6) each. Wait, maybe I should just accept that the coefficients for each term are sqrt(1/2) each? No, that might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible ways to get m=-1. The possible m1 and m2 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Each of these contributes with a certain coefficient.\n\nWait, I think the correct expansion for |2, -1> is:\n\n|2, -1> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ]\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the normalization would require the sum of squares to be 1. If each coefficient is 1/sqrt(2), then 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are sqrt(1/3) each. Because for |2, -2>, it's just |m1=-1, m2=-1>, so coefficient 1. For |2, -1>, it's a combination of two terms. Let me think about the CG coefficients for two p orbitals (l=1) combining to l=2.\n\nLooking it up in my memory, the CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, total l=2:\n\nFor m=2: only |1,1> \u2192 coefficient 1.\n\nFor m=1: (|1,0> + |0,1>)/sqrt(2).\n\nFor m=0: (|1,-1> + |0,0> + |-1,1>)/sqrt(3).\n\nFor m=-1: (|0,-1> + |-1,0>)/sqrt(2).\n\nFor m=-2: only |-1,-1> \u2192 coefficient 1.\n\nSo, for m=-1, the state is (|0,-1> + |-1,0>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the coefficients are each 1/sqrt(2), and the square is 1/2 each. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is (|m1=0, m2=-1> + |m1=-1, m2=0>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo, when we have the state |1,1,2,-1>, it's a superposition of these two basis states with equal amplitudes.\n\nNow, the question is about measuring L1z and L2z. So, the possible outcomes for L1z are m1 * \u0127, and similarly for L2z, m2 * \u0127.\n\nWe're to find the probability that both measurements give -\u0127. So, both L1z and L2z are -\u0127. That would correspond to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.\n\nWait, but in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the possible (m1, m2) combinations that contribute are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So, in the state, we have these two possibilities.\n\nWait, but if we're measuring both L1z and L2z, we're looking for the probability that m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. But in the coupled state, the only possible (m1, m2) combinations are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So, the measurement of m1 and m2 can't be (-1,-1) because that combination doesn't appear in the state.\n\nSo, in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the possible outcomes for (m1, m2) are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So, the probability of measuring m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero because these terms don't appear in the state.\n\nWait, but wait, the question says that the measurement is of L1z and L2z. So, the possible outcomes for each are -\u0127, 0, +\u0127, because each electron has l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1, and Lz = m\u0127.\n\nSo, the possible outcomes are m1 and m2, each being -1, 0, or +1.\n\nIn the state |1,1,2,-1>, the expansion is in terms of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1. So, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So, when you make a measurement, you can't get any other pairs, like (-1,-1), because that would give m=-2, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, the probability of getting m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero. Because those terms don't exist in the state. So, the probability is zero.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 0. So the answer should be D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l = 2$ and $m = -1$ are the total angular momentum quantum numbers of the system. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ and obtaining eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ for both.\n\nTo solve this, we analyze the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ combinations that contribute to the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$. Since $m = m_1 + m_2$, the only pairs of $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$. These correspond to the uncoupled basis states $|m_1, m_2>$ that make up the coupled state.

So, I think I need to find the possible m1 and m2 values for each electron such that when combined, they give the total m of -1 and l of 2.\n\nWait, but the state is |1,1,2,-1>, right? So l1=1, l2=1. Each electron is in a p orbital, so l=1 for each. The total orbital angular momentum is l=2. And the magnetic quantum number for the total is m=-1.\n\nSo, the state is a coupled state of the two electrons. To find the possible m1 and m2 values, I should think about the addition of angular momenta. Each electron has m1 and m2, so m = m1 + m2. Here, the total m is -1.

If each coefficient is 1/sqrt(2), then 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are sqrt(1/3) each. Because for |2, -2>, it's just |m1=-1, m2=-1>, so coefficient 1. For |2, -1>, it's a combination of two terms. Let me think about the CG coefficients for two p orbitals (l=1) combining to l=2.\n\nLooking it up in my memory, the CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, total l=2:\n\nFor m=2: only |1,1> \u2192 coefficient 1.\n\nFor m=1: (|1,0> + |0,1>)/sqrt(2).\n\nFor m=0: (|1,-1> + |0,0> + |-1,1>)/sqrt(3).\n\nFor m=-1: (|0,-1> + |-1,0>)/sqrt(2).\n\nFor m=-2: only |-1,-1> \u2192 coefficient 1.\n\nSo, for m=-1, the state is (|0,-1> + |-1,0>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the coefficients are each 1/sqrt(2), and the square is 1/2 each. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is (|m1=0, m2=-1> + |m1=-1, m2=0>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo, when we have the state |1,1,2,-1>, it's a superposition of these two basis states with equal amplitudes.\n\nNow, the question is about measuring L1z and L2z. So, the possible outcomes for L1z are m1 * \u0127, and similarly for L2z, m2 * \u0127.\n\nWe're to find the probability that both measurements give -\u0127. So, both L1z and L2z are -\u0127. That would correspond to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.\n\nWait, but in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the possible (m1, m2) combinations that contribute are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So, in the state, we have these two possibilities.\n\nWait, but if we're measuring both L1z and L2z, we're looking for the probability that m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. But in the coupled state, the only possible (m1, m2) combinations are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So, the measurement of m1 and m2 can't be (-1,-1) because that combination doesn't appear in the state.\n\nSo, in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the possible outcomes for (m1, m2) are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So, the probability of measuring m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero because these terms don't appear in the state.\n\nWait, but wait, the question says that the measurement is of L1z and L2z. So, the possible outcomes for each are -\u0127, 0, +\u0127, because each electron has l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1, and Lz = m\u0127.\n\nSo, the possible outcomes are m1 and m2, each being -1, 0, or +1.\n\nIn the state |1,1,2,-1>, the expansion is in terms of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1. So, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So, when you make a measurement, you can't get any other pairs, like (-1,-1), because that would give m=-2, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, the probability of getting m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero. Because those terms don't exist in the state. So, the probability is zero.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 0. So the answer should be D.\n\n\nThe problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l = 2$ and $m = -1$ are the total angular momentum quantum numbers of the system. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ and obtaining eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ for both.\n\nTo solve this, we analyze the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ combinations that contribute to the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$. Since $m = m_1 + m_2$, the only pairs of $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$. These correspond to the uncoupled basis states $|m_1, m_2>$ that make up the coupled state. The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is therefore a normalized superposition of these two basis states, with equal coefficients of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$. This corresponds to the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ combination. However, in the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$, the only possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$. The $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ combination does not appear in the state, as it would correspond to $m = -2$, which is inconsistent with the given $m = -1$.\n\nSince the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ combination is absent in the coupled state, the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n**Answer: D**",

We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, which probably means we can focus just on the orbital part. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Let me parse that.

The expansion coefficients are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Hmm, I'm a bit hazy on the exact coefficients, but maybe I don't need them for this problem. Because the question is about the probability of both electrons having Lz = -\u0127. So for each electron, m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.\n\nWait, because L1z and L2z are measured. So we're looking for the probability that m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because L1z = m1 * \u0127, and similarly for L2z.\n\nBut wait, in the coupled state, the total m is -1. So for m1 and m2, m1 + m2 = -1.

No other possibilities because (1, -2) is invalid.\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> is a superposition of these possible (m1, m2) states. Wait, no, in the coupled state, it's a specific combination. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific eigenstate of L\u00b2 and Lz, which is a combination of all possible |m1, m2> states that add up to m= -1.\n\nWait, but actually, for two particles, the total state is a combination of |m1> |m2> where m1 + m2 = M, where M is the total m. So in this case, M is -1.\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a linear combination of |m1= -1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. Because those are the only possible m1 and m2 that sum to -1.\n\nSo when we express |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states |m1> |m2>, it's a sum of these two possibilities.\n\nSo for each of these product states, the probability of measuring m1 and m2 is determined by the coefficients in the expansion.\n\nBut the question is about the probability that both L1z and L2z are -\u0127. That would require m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. But m1 + m2 would be -2, which doesn't match the total m of -1.\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> has zero amplitude for the state where both m1 and m2 are -1. Because the allowed m1 and m2 are only (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the probability is zero.\n\nSo the joint probability of both measurements being -\u0127 is zero. So the answer should be D) 0.\n\n\nThe problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l = 2$ and $m = -1$ are the total angular momentum quantum numbers of the two-electron system. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nFor a single electron in a p orbital, the possible $m$ values are $-1, 0, +1$. When combining two electrons, the total $m$ is the sum of the individual $m_1$ and $m_2$ values. The given state $|1,1,2,-1>$ has a total $m = -1$, so the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ are:\n\n1. $m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0$\n2. $m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1$\n\nThese are the only valid combinations because $m_1$ and $m_2$ cannot exceed the range $[-1, 0, +1]$ for $l = 1$. Notably, the pair $(m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1)$ sums to $m = -2$, which does not match the total $m = -1$ of the given state. Therefore, the state $|1,1,2,-1>$ has no component corresponding to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nSince the state $|1,1,2,-1>$ does not include the $(m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1)$ configuration, the probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is zero.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's see. The question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and we're looking at their angular momentum states. The given state is |1,1,2,-1>, which represents the coupled angular momentum state. I need to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -\u0127.\n\nWait, wait, I'm a bit confused. So, each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. Since they're in a p orbital, each l is 1. So the individual l1 and l2 are 1 each. The total angular momentum quantum number l is given as 2, and the magnetic quantum number m is -1.\n\nThe state is |l1, l2, L, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So the total angular momentum is L=2 and m_L = -1. Now, the question is about measuring L1z and L2z. Both are the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum.\n\nSo, L1z is the operator for the first electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction, and similarly for L2z. Each of these operators has eigenvalues m\u0127, where m is the magnetic quantum number for that electron. Since each electron has l=1, their possible m values are -1, 0, +1.\n\nWait, but the question is about the joint probability of both L1z and L2z being -\u0127. So, each would have m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. So, the combined m would be m1 + m2 = -2. But in the state given, the total m is -1. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait a second, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1, which is the sum of m1 and m2. So m1 + m2 = -1. But we're looking for a situation where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. That would sum to -2, which is different from the given m of -1. So that's a problem. Because in this state, the total m is -1, so the individual m's can't both be -1, because that would require m_total to be -2. So is this even possible?\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The state given is a coupled state. The state is expressed in terms of the total angular momentum, so perhaps the individual m1 and m2 don't add up to m directly. Or, maybe not. Wait, no, the total m is m1 + m2. So if m is -1, then m1 + m2 = -1. So if each L1z and L2z are measured, the possible m1 and m2 would have to add up to -1.\n\nBut the question is asking for the probability that both are -\u0127. That would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, which adds up to -2. But our state has m_total of -1. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't have any component where m1 and m2 are both -1. Because that would require m_total to be -2, which is not the case here.\n\nSo, if I'm measuring both L1z and L2z, and looking for both to be -\u0127, that corresponds to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. But since m_total is m1 + m2 = -2, which isn't present in the state, the probability would be zero.\n\nWait, but how do I know if the state includes any component where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1? Because the state is in a coupled basis, so it's a combination of individual states. Hmm, but the coupled state is |l1,l2, L, m>, so perhaps the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of states with different m1 and m2, but their sum is -1.\n\nSo, for example, possible (m1, m2) pairs could be (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-2) but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can be -1, 0, +1. So the possible m1 and m2 combinations that add to -1 are: (-1,0) and (0,-1). Because (-1+0)= -1, (0 + (-1)) = -1. Are there any others? Let's see: (1, -2) is impossible because m2 can't be -2. So only those two combinations.\n\nSo in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the possible individual m1 and m2 are either (-1, 0) or (0, -1). So in this state, the possible m1 and m2 values are such that their sum is -1. So if I measure L1z and L2z, the possible outcomes are either m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> is a superposition of these two possibilities. Wait, but how exactly? Because when you have coupled states, the |l1,l2, L, m> state is a linear combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = m. So in this case, the state is a sum of |m1, m2> states with m1 + m2 = -1.\n\nBut the problem says to ignore the spin angular momentum, which I think is okay because the question is about orbital angular momentum.\n\nSo, the state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. So possible m1 and m2 pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Are there any other possibilities? Let me think: m1 can be 1, then m2 would have to be -2, but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so that's not allowed. Similarly, m1=2 would be impossible, so only those two cases.\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. So when we express it, it's something like a|\u22121,0> + b|0,\u22121>, with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1.\n\nBut wait, the coefficients depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, right? Because when you couple two angular momenta, the states are built from the product states. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients tell us how to combine the |m1, m2> states into the |L, M> states.\n\nSo, the coefficient a would be the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining m1=\u22121 and m2=0 to get M=\u22121, and similarly for m1=0 and m2=\u22121.\n\nBut the question is about the joint probability of both electrons having m=\u22121, which would require m1=\u22121 and m2=\u22121. But in our state, the possible m1 and m2 combinations are either (\u22121,0) or (0,\u22121). So the state does not have any component where both m1 and m2 are \u22121. Hence, the probability of measuring both as \u2212\u0127 is zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D) 0.\n",

Hmm, the question is about two electrons in p orbitals, ignoring their spin angular momentum. The state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, I need to parse that. So l1 is 1, l2 is 1, the total angular momentum l is 2, and m is -1.\n\nThe question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -\u0127. Oh right, Lz is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l, so l1 and l2 are 1 for both electrons here.\n\nSo each electron's Lz can take values from -l to +l in steps of 1. For l=1, that means each Lz can be -1, 0, or +1 times \u0127. So for each electron, the possible eigenvalues are -\u0127, 0, or \u0127.\n\nThe state given is a coupled angular momentum state. Coupled states usually involve combining individual angular momenta into total angular momentum. So for two electrons, each with l=1, the possible total L values would be l1 + l2 down to |l1 - l2|. So 1+1=2, 1-1=0. So L can be 2, 1, or 0. But in the given state, it's L=2, m=-1.\n\nNow, the problem is about the joint probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -\u0127. So each electron contributes an Lz of -\u0127. So the sum would be Lz = -\u0127 + (-\u0127) = -2\u0127. But wait, the total state has m = -1. So the total m is -1 \u0127. But if each Lz is -1 \u0127, their sum is -2 \u0127, which doesn't match the total m of -1 \u0127.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because the state |l1, l2, l, m> is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum L\u00b2 and Lz. So in this state, the total m is -1. So when we measure the total Lz, it must be -1 \u0127. But in the measurement of individual L1z and L2z, their sum must equal the total m, which is -1.\n\nWait, but the question is about both L1z and L2z being -\u0127. So their sum would be -2 \u0127, which doesn't match m = -1. So that's impossible. Because in this state, the total m is fixed. Therefore, the joint measurement of both L1z and L2z being -\u0127 can't happen because it would violate the total m.\n\nSo the probability is zero. Because in this state, the sum of individual m's (m1 + m2) must equal the total m of -1. So if both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum is -2, which isn't equal to -1. So such a state can't be part of the given |1,1,2,-1> state. Therefore, the probability is zero.\n\nLet me think again. Another way: the given state is a specific coupled state. When you have a state |l1, l2, L, M>, it's an eigenstate of L\u00b2, Lz, and also of each L1\u00b2, L2\u00b2, and L1\u00b7L2. So when you measure individual L1z and L2z, you're looking for the possible combinations of m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M, which is -1 here.\n\nSo the possible (m1, m2) pairs must add up to -1. So possible pairs are (-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2, 1) isn't possible because l1 and l2 are 1, so m can't be -2 or 2. Wait, l=1 so m can be -1, 0, +1. So for m1 + m2 = -1:\n\nPossible pairs are:\n\nm1 = -1, m2 = 0 \u2192 sum is -1.\n\nm1 = 0, m2 = -1 \u2192 sum is -1.\n\nm1 = 1, m2 = -2 \u2192 but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can't be -2. Similarly, m1= -2 is impossible. So only two possible (m1, m2) pairs.\n\nTherefore, the only possible (m1, m2) that contribute to the state are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). So if you measure both L1z and L2z as -\u0127, that's m1 = -1, m2 = -1. Sum is -2, which doesn't match M=-1. So this outcome is impossible.

So l1 is 1, l2 is 1, the total angular momentum l is 2, and m is -1.\n\nThe question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -\u0127. Oh right, Lz is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l, so l1 and l2 are 1 for both electrons here.\n\nSo each electron's Lz can take values from -l to +l in steps of 1. For l=1, that means each Lz can be -1, 0, or +1 times \u0127. So for each electron, the possible eigenvalues are -\u0127, 0, or \u0127.\n\nThe state given is a coupled angular momentum state. Coupled states usually involve combining individual angular momenta into total angular momentum. So for two electrons, each with l=1, the possible total L values would be l1 + l2 down to |l1 - l2|. So 1+1=2, 1-1=0. So L can be 2, 1, or 0. But in the given state, it's L=2, m=-1.\n\nNow, the problem is about the joint probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -\u0127. So each electron contributes an Lz of -\u0127. So the sum would be Lz = -\u0127 + (-\u0127) = -2\u0127. But wait, the total state has m = -1. So the total m is -1 \u0127. But if each Lz is -1 \u0127, their sum is -2 \u0127, which doesn't match the total m of -1 \u0127.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because the state |l1, l2, l, m> is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum L\u00b2 and Lz. So in this state, the total m is -1. So when we measure the total Lz, it must be -1 \u0127. But in the measurement of individual L1z and L2z, their sum must equal the total m, which is -1.\n\nWait, but the question is about both L1z and L2z being -\u0127. So their sum would be -2 \u0127, which doesn't match m = -1. So that's impossible. Because in this state, the total m is fixed. Therefore, the joint measurement of both L1z and L2z being -\u0127 can't happen because it would violate the total m.\n\nSo the probability is zero. Because in this state, the sum of individual m's (m1 + m2) must equal the total m of -1. So if both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum is -2, which isn't equal to -1. So such a state can't be part of the given |1,1,2,-1> state. Therefore, the probability is zero.\n\nLet me think again. Another way: the given state is a specific coupled state. When you have a state |l1, l2, L, M>, it's an eigenstate of L\u00b2, Lz, and also of each L1\u00b2, L2\u00b2, and L1\u00b7L2. So when you measure individual L1z and L2z, you're looking for the possible combinations of m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M, which is -1 here.\n\nSo the possible (m1, m2) pairs must add up to -1. So possible pairs are (-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2, 1) isn't possible because l1 and l2 are 1, so m can't be -2 or 2. Wait, l=1 so m can be -1, 0, +1. So for m1 + m2 = -1:\n\nPossible pairs are:\n\nm1 = -1, m2 = 0 \u2192 sum is -1.\n\nm1 = 0, m2 = -1 \u2192 sum is -1.\n\nm1 = 1, m2 = -2 \u2192 but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can't be -2. Similarly, m1= -2 is impossible. So only two possible (m1, m2) pairs.\n\nTherefore, the only possible (m1, m2) that contribute to the state are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). So if you measure both L1z and L2z as -\u0127, that's m1 = -1, m2 = -1. Sum is -2, which doesn't match M=-1. So this outcome is impossible. Therefore, the probability is zero.\n\nSo the correct answer is D) 0.\n\n\nThe problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state described as $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$, where $l_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 1$, $l = 2$, and $m = -1$. The question asks for the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n\nEach electron's orbital angular momentum $L_{z}$ can take values $-1\\hbar$, $0\\hbar$, or $+\\hbar$ since $l = 1$. The total angular momentum $L_z$ is given as $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. For the joint measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, the sum of the individual $L_{z}$ values must equal the total $L_z$, i.e., $m_1 + m_2 = m = -1$. \n\nIf both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are measured as $-\\hbar$, their sum would be $-2\\hbar$, which does not match the total $L_z = -1\\hbar$. This is inconsistent with the given state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$, where the total $L_z$ is fixed at $-1\\hbar$. Therefore, the joint measurement of $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$ is impossible in this state.\n\nThe only possible combinations of $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$. Since the combination $(-1, -1)$ does not satisfy this condition, the probability of this outcome is zero.\n\nAnswer: D",

Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, so I guess that's not part of the problem. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l\u2081, l\u2082, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. \n\nI remember that in angular momentum coupling, when you have two particles, their individual angular momenta can combine to form a total angular momentum. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l, which here is 1 for both (since it's a p orbital, l=1). So each has l\u2081 = 1 and l\u2082 =1.\n\nThe total angular momentum quantum number l is given as 2, and m is -1. So the state is |1,1,2,-1>.\n\nThe question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L\u2081z and L\u2082z to be -\u0127. Hmm, because each L_z eigenvalue is m multiplied by \u0127. So for each electron, the possible m values range from -l to +l. Since l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1.\n\nWait, but the state is a coupled state, so the individual m's might not be straightforward. Let me think about how the coupled state is built from the individual states.\n\nIn coupled angular momentum, the state |l\u2081, l\u2082, l, m> is a combination of states |l\u2081, m\u2081> \u2297 |l\u2082, m\u2082>, such that m\u2081 + m\u2082 = m. In this case, m is -1, so m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -1.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the joint probability that both m\u2081 and m\u2082 are -1. Because L\u2081z is m\u2081 * \u0127 and L\u2082z is m\u2082 * \u0127. So both m\u2081 and m\u2082 would have to be -1 for both measurements to yield -\u0127.\n\nWait, so what's the probability that in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the individual m\u2081 and m\u2082 are both -1?\n\nI think I need to express the coupled state in terms of the product of individual states. So the state |l\u2081=1, l\u2082=1, L=2, M=-1> can be written as a linear combination of |m\u2081, m\u2082> where m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -1.\n\nThe possible (m\u2081, m\u2082) pairs that add up to -1 are: (-1,-0), (-2, 1), (-0, -1). Wait, no, wait. Let me list all possibilities where m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -1.\n\nm\u2081 can be -1, 0, +1. Similarly for m\u2082. So combinations are:\n\nm\u2081 = -1, m\u2082 = 0 \u2192 sum -1.\n\nm\u2081 = 0, m\u2082 = -1 \u2192 sum -1.\n\nm\u2081 = -2? No, wait, because l=1, so m can't be -2. So the possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Wait, wait, no, because m\u2081 can be -1, 0, +1. So m\u2081 = -1, m\u2082 = 0 \u2192 sum -1.\n\nm\u2081 = 0, m\u2082 = -1 \u2192 sum -1.\n\nm\u2081 = 1, m\u2082 = -2 \u2192 but m\u2082 can't be -2 because l=1 for the second particle. So only two possible pairs: (-1,0) and (0,-1).\n\nWait, but the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> would be a linear combination of all possible |m\u2081, m\u2082> states where m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -1. So that's two terms: |m\u2081=-1, m\u2082=0> and |m\u2081=0, m\u2082=-1>.\n\nBut I think the coefficients depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m\u2081=-1, m\u2082=0> and |m\u2081=0, m\u2082=-1>.\n\nWait, but how are these combined? Let me think. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M. For L=2 and M=-1, the state can be written as a sum of |m\u2081, m\u2082> such that m\u2081 + m\u2082 = M = -1.\n\nSo the possible (m\u2081, m\u2082) pairs are:\n\n(-1, 0) and (0, -1).\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of these two states. The coefficients can be found using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nI remember that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l1=1 and l2=1 to get L=2 and M=-1 are given by:\n\nThe state is a sum over m\u2081 and m\u2082 where m\u2081 + m\u2082 = M.\n\nSo for L=2, M=-1, the coefficients are:\n\nThe state |1,1,2,-1> = sqrt(1/2) |m\u2081=-1, m\u2082=0> + sqrt(1/2) |m\u2081=0, m\u2082=-1>.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure about the coefficients. Let me think about how to calculate them.\n\nWait, another approach. The general formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M is given by:\n\n|l1, l2, L, M> = sum_{m1, m2} [ (2L+1)^{1/2} ( (l1, l2, L) | (m1, m2, M) ) ) ] |m1, m2>\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the expansion is:\n\n|l1, m1> \u2297 |l2, m2> = sum_{L, M} [ <l1, m1; l2, m2 | L, M> ] |L, M>\n\nBut when we're expanding |L, M> in terms of |m1, m2>, it's the other way around.\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n|L, M> = sum_{m1, m2} [ <m1, m2 | L, M> ] |l1, m1> |l2, m2>\n\nAnd the coefficients are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nIn this case, l1 = l2 = 1, L=2, M=-1.\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> is equal to sum over m1, m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1 of [ <m1, m2 | 2, -1> ] |1, m1> |1, m2>.\n\nThe possible (m1, m2) are (-1,0) and (0,-1).\n\nSo the state is:\n\nsqrt(2/3) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt(1/3) |m1=0, m2=-1>\n\nWait, I'm not sure about the exact coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are based on the Wigner 3-j symbols or Racah coefficients. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the possible ways to combine the states.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of possible combinations for each M value.\n\nIn the coupled state, the possible M values for L=2 are -2, -1, 0, +1, +2.\n\nThe state |1,1,2,-1> is a particular combination.\n\nLet me think about the expansion coefficients for M=-1. The state can be expressed as a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nThe coefficients can be found using the formula for combining angular momenta.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l1=1 and l2=1 to get L=2 and M=-1 is given by:\n\nsqrt( ( (2 - m1) (2 + m1 + 1) ) / (4 (2 + 1)) )) )\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the exact coefficients for this case.\n\nWait, alternatively, for L=2 and M=-1, the expansion is:\n\n|2, -1> = sqrt( ( (2 - (-1)) (2 + (-1) +1) ) / (4 * 3) )) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt( ( (2 - 0) (2 +0 +1) ) / (4 * 3) ) |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Alternatively, I remember that for l1=1 and l2=1, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2 and M=-1 are:\n\nsqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but I'm not sure which term comes first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the square of the coefficients, since we're dealing with probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the possible ways the states can combine. For L=2, M=-1, the possible m1 and m2 are -1 and 0, or 0 and -1.\n\nThe state |2, -1> is a linear combination of these two product states.\n\nAssuming the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The general formula for coupling l1 and l2 to get L and M is:\n\n< l1, m1; l2, m2 | L, M > = [ ( (2L + 1) )^(1/2) * ( (l1 + l2 - L)(l1 + l2 + L + 1) )^(1/2) ) / ( (2l2 + 1) (2L + 1) ) ) ] * [ ( (l1 + l2 - L) ( L + l1 - l2 + 1 ) ( L - l1 + l2 + 1 ) ) / ( (l1 + l2 + L + 1) ) ) ]^(1/2) * ... Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the state |2, -1> can be written as a sum of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.\n\nSo the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nThe coefficients can be found using the following approach.\n\nThe state |2, -1> is orthogonal to |2, -2> and |2, -1> is orthogonal to other M states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the ladder operators. The state |2, -1> is obtained by applying the lowering operator L- to |2, 2> a certain number of times.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps me here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recall the expansion coefficients for L=2, M=-1 when l1=1 and l2=1.\n\nI think the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) for |m1=-1, m2=0> and sqrt(1/3) for |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nWait, but I'm not confident. Let me think again.\n\nThe state |2, -1> should be orthogonal to any state that doesn't have M = -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the inner product of the coupled state with the product states.\n\nWait, the state |2, -1> is:\n\n|2, -1> = a |1, -1> |1, 0> + b |1, 0> |1, -1>.\n\nWe can find a and b by knowing that it's a normalized state, and perhaps by using orthogonality conditions.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible expansion coefficients.\n\nWait, I remember that for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2, the coefficients are given by:\n\n< l1, m1; l2, m2 | L, M > = [ ( (2L + 1) )^(1/2) * ( ( (l1 + l2 - L) ( L + l1 - l2 + 1 ) ( L - l1 + l2 + 1 ) ) )^(1/2) ) / ( (2l2 + 1) (2L + 1) ) ) ] * [ ( ( l1 + l2 + L + 1 ) )^(1/2) ) ]\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. I can think about the possible states that make up |2, -1>.\n\nThe state |2, -1> is obtained by acting with the lowering operator L- on |2, 2>.\n\nBut perhaps that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible ways to get M=-1 from the sum of m1 and m2.\n\nSo m1 can be -1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.\n\nSo the state |2, -1> is a linear combination of these two product states.\n\nThe coefficients can be determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let me look for a table or formula.\n\nUpon checking, for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1:\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n|2, -1> = sqrt(2/3) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt(1/3) |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's the other way around.\n\nWait, perhaps I can refer to a standard angular momentum addition table.\n\nIn the case of l1=1 and l2=1, the state |2, -1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nThe coefficients are given by:\n\nsqrt( ( (2 - (-1)) (2 + (-1) +1) ) / (4 * (2 +1)) ) ) * sqrt( ( (2 - 0) (2 + 0 +1) ) / (4 * (2 +1)) ) )\n\nWait, that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficients are found using the formula:\n\nThe coefficient for |m1, m2> in |L, M> is sqrt( ( (2L + 1) ) * ( (l1 + l2 - L) ( L + l1 - l2 + 1 ) ( L - l1 + l2 + 1 ) ) ) / ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1)(2L +1) )) ) * something.\n\nI'm getting stuck here, but perhaps I can proceed with the assumption that the state is a sum of the two terms with coefficients sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3). So the state is:\n\n|2, -1> = sqrt(2/3) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt(1/3) |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nWait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are such that the square of each gives the probability of finding that particular m1 and m2.\n\nSo the probability of m1=-1 and m2=0 is (sqrt(2/3))\u00b2 = 2/3.\n\nThe probability of m1=0 and m2=-1 is (sqrt(1/3))\u00b2 = 1/3.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the joint probability that both m1 and m2 are -1. Because the question says, what's the probability that L1z and L2z are both -\u0127. So m1 and m2 must both be -1. But in the coupled state |2,-1>, are there any terms where m1=-1 and m2=-1?\n\nNo, because m1 + m2 = -1. So m1=-1 and m2=-1 would sum to -2, which is not equal to M=-1. So there are no terms in the coupled state where both m1 and m2 are -1. Therefore, the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Because in the coupled state, the sum m1 + m2 must equal M=-1. So if m1 is -1, m2 has to be 0. Similarly, if m1 is 0, m2 has to be -1.\n\nTherefore, there's no term in the expansion where m1=-1 and m2=-1. So the coefficient for such a term is zero. So the probability is zero.\n\nSo the answer must be D) 0.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The state is |2,-1>, which is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. There's no term where m1 and m2 are both -1, because that would sum to -2, which is M=-2, not M=-1.\n\nTherefore, when the state is |2,-1>, the only possible outcomes for m1 and m2 are:\n\n- m1=-1, m2=0.\n\n- m1=0, m2=-1.\n\nSo the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability is zero.\n",

So combinations are:\n\nm\u2081 = -1, m\u2082 = 0 \u2192 sum -1.\n\nm\u2081 = 0, m\u2082 = -1 \u2192 sum -1.\n\nm\u2081 = -2? No, wait, because l=1, so m can't be -2. So the possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Wait, wait, no, because m\u2081 can be -1, 0, +1. So m\u2081 = -1, m\u2082 = 0 \u2192 sum -1.\n\nm\u2081 = 0, m\u2082 = -1 \u2192 sum -1.\n\nm\u2081 = 1, m\u2082 = -2 \u2192 but m\u2082 can't be -2 because l=1 for the second particle. So only two possible pairs: (-1,0) and (0,-1).\n\nWait, but the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> would be a linear combination of all possible |m\u2081, m\u2082> states where m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -1. So that's two terms: |m\u2081=-1, m\u2082=0> and |m\u2081=0, m\u2082=-1>.\n\nBut I think the coefficients depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m\u2081=-1, m\u2082=0> and |m\u2081=0, m\u2082=-1>.\n\nWait, but how are these combined? Let me think. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M. For L=2 and M=-1, the state can be written as a sum of |m\u2081, m\u2082> such that m\u2081 + m\u2082 = M = -1.\n\nSo the possible (m\u2081, m\u2082) pairs are:\n\n(-1, 0) and (0, -1).\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of these two states. The coefficients can be found using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nI remember that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l1=1 and l2=1 to get L=2 and M=-1 are given by:\n\nThe state is a sum over m\u2081 and m\u2082 where m\u2081 + m\u2082 = M.\n\nSo for L=2, M=-1, the coefficients are:\n\nThe state |1,1,2,-1> = sqrt(1/2) |m\u2081=-1, m\u2082=0> + sqrt(1/2) |m\u2081=0, m\u2082=-1>.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure about the coefficients. Let me think about how to calculate them.\n\nWait, another approach. The general formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M is given by:\n\n|l1, l2, L, M> = sum_{m1, m2} [ (2L+1)^{1/2} ( (l1, l2, L) | (m1, m2, M) ) ) ] |m1, m2>\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the expansion is:\n\n|l1, m1> \u2297 |l2, m2> = sum_{L, M} [ <l1, m1; l2, m2 | L, M> ] |L, M>\n\nBut when we're expanding |L, M> in terms of |m1, m2>, it's the other way around.\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n|L, M> = sum_{m1, m2} [ <m1, m2 | L, M> ] |l1, m1> |l2, m2>\n\nAnd the coefficients are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nIn this case, l1 = l2 = 1, L=2, M=-1.\n\nSo the state |1,1,2,-1> is equal to sum over m1, m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1 of [ <m1, m2 | 2, -1> ] |1, m1> |1, m2>.\n\nThe possible (m1, m2) are (-1,0) and (0,-1).\n\nSo the state is:\n\nsqrt(2/3) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt(1/3) |m1=0, m2=-1>\n\nWait, I'm not sure about the exact coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are based on the Wigner 3-j symbols or Racah coefficients. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the possible ways to combine the states.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of possible combinations for each M value.\n\nIn the coupled state, the possible M values for L=2 are -2, -1, 0, +1, +2.\n\nThe state |1,1,2,-1> is a particular combination.\n\nLet me think about the expansion coefficients for M=-1. The state can be expressed as a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nThe coefficients can be found using the formula for combining angular momenta.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l1=1 and l2=1 to get L=2 and M=-1 is given by:\n\nsqrt( ( (2 - m1) (2 + m1 + 1) ) / (4 (2 + 1)) )) )\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the exact coefficients for this case.\n\nWait, alternatively, for L=2 and M=-1, the expansion is:\n\n|2, -1> = sqrt( ( (2 - (-1)) (2 + (-1) +1) ) / (4 * 3) )) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt( ( (2 - 0) (2 +0 +1) ) / (4 * 3) ) |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Alternatively, I remember that for l1=1 and l2=1, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2 and M=-1 are:\n\nsqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but I'm not sure which term comes first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the square of the coefficients, since we're dealing with probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the possible ways the states can combine. For L=2, M=-1, the possible m1 and m2 are -1 and 0, or 0 and -1.\n\nThe state |2, -1> is a linear combination of these two product states.\n\nAssuming the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The general formula for coupling l1 and l2 to get L and M is:\n\n< l1, m1; l2, m2 | L, M > = [ ( (2L + 1) )^(1/2) * ( (l1 + l2 - L)(l1 + l2 + L + 1) )^(1/2) ) / ( (2l2 + 1) (2L + 1) ) ) ] * [ ( (l1 + l2 - L) ( L + l1 - l2 + 1 ) ( L - l1 + l2 + 1 ) ) / ( (l1 + l2 + L + 1) ) ) ]^(1/2) * ... Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the state |2, -1> can be written as a sum of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.\n\nSo the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nThe coefficients can be found using the following approach.\n\nThe state |2, -1> is orthogonal to |2, -2> and |2, -1> is orthogonal to other M states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the ladder operators. The state |2, -1> is obtained by applying the lowering operator L- to |2, 2> a certain number of times.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps me here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recall the expansion coefficients for L=2, M=-1 when l1=1 and l2=1.\n\nI think the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) for |m1=-1, m2=0> and sqrt(1/3) for |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nWait, but I'm not confident. Let me think again.\n\nThe state |2, -1> should be orthogonal to any state that doesn't have M = -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the inner product of the coupled state with the product states.\n\nWait, the state |2, -1> is:\n\n|2, -1> = a |1, -1> |1, 0> + b |1, 0> |1, -1>.\n\nWe can find a and b by knowing that it's a normalized state, and perhaps by using orthogonality conditions.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible expansion coefficients.\n\nWait, I remember that for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2, the coefficients are given by:\n\n< l1, m1; l2, m2 | L, M > = [ ( (2L + 1) )^(1/2) * ( ( (l1 + l2 - L) ( L + l1 - l2 + 1 ) ( L - l1 + l2 + 1 ) ) )^(1/2) ) / ( (2l2 + 1) (2L + 1) ) ) ] * [ ( ( l1 + l2 + L + 1 ) )^(1/2) ) ]\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. I can think about the possible states that make up |2, -1>.\n\nThe state |2, -1> is obtained by acting with the lowering operator L- on |2, 2>.\n\nBut perhaps that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible ways to get M=-1 from the sum of m1 and m2.\n\nSo m1 can be -1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.\n\nSo the state |2, -1> is a linear combination of these two product states.\n\nThe coefficients can be determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let me look for a table or formula.\n\nUpon checking, for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1:\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n|2, -1> = sqrt(2/3) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt(1/3) |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's the other way around.\n\nWait, perhaps I can refer to a standard angular momentum addition table.\n\nIn the case of l1=1 and l2=1, the state |2, -1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nThe coefficients are given by:\n\nsqrt( ( (2 - (-1)) (2 + (-1) +1) ) / (4 * (2 +1)) ) ) * sqrt( ( (2 - 0) (2 + 0 +1) ) / (4 * (2 +1)) ) )\n\nWait, that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficients are found using the formula:\n\nThe coefficient for |m1, m2> in |L, M> is sqrt( ( (2L + 1) ) * ( (l1 + l2 - L) ( L + l1 - l2 + 1 ) ( L - l1 + l2 + 1 ) ) ) / ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1)(2L +1) )) ) * something.\n\nI'm getting stuck here, but perhaps I can proceed with the assumption that the state is a sum of the two terms with coefficients sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3). So the state is:\n\n|2, -1> = sqrt(2/3) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt(1/3) |m1=0, m2=-1>.\n\nWait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are such that the square of each gives the probability of finding that particular m1 and m2.\n\nSo the probability of m1=-1 and m2=0 is (sqrt(2/3))\u00b2 = 2/3.\n\nThe probability of m1=0 and m2=-1 is (sqrt(1/3))\u00b2 = 1/3.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the joint probability that both m1 and m2 are -1. Because the question says, what's the probability that L1z and L2z are both -\u0127. So m1 and m2 must both be -1. But in the coupled state |2,-1>, are there any terms where m1=-1 and m2=-1?\n\nNo, because m1 + m2 = -1. So m1=-1 and m2=-1 would sum to -2, which is not equal to M=-1. So there are no terms in the coupled state where both m1 and m2 are -1. Therefore, the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Because in the coupled state, the sum m1 + m2 must equal M=-1. So if m1 is -1, m2 has to be 0. Similarly, if m1 is 0, m2 has to be -1.\n\nTherefore, there's no term in the expansion where m1=-1 and m2=-1. So the coefficient for such a term is zero. So the probability is zero.\n\nSo the answer must be D) 0.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The state is |2,-1>, which is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. There's no term where m1 and m2 are both -1, because that would sum to -2, which is M=-2, not M=-1.\n\nTherefore, when the state is |2,-1>, the only possible outcomes for m1 and m2 are:\n\n- m1=-1, m2=0.\n\n- m1=0, m2=-1.\n\nSo the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability is zero.\n\n\nThe problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, $l = 2$ is the total angular momentum quantum number, and $m = -1$ is the $z$-component of the total angular momentum. The question asks for the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nIn angular momentum coupling, the coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m>$ is a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2>$ such that $m_1 + m_2 = m$. For the given state $|1,1,2,-1>$, the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ are:\n\n1. $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$\n2. $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$\n\nThus, the coupled state can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n|1,1,2,-1> = a |m_1=-1, m_2=0> + b |m_1=0, m_2=-1>\n\\]\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state does not include a term where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, as this would require $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which corresponds to $M = -2$, not $M = -1$. Therefore, the coefficient for the term $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ is zero.\n\nSince the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ does not include any contribution from the product state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$, the joint probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is zero.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",
