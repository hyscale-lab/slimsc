      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about energy levels and their lifetimes, and figuring out the energy difference needed so that two states can be clearly distinguished.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The question is asking which energy difference between them allows us to clearly resolve these two levels. The options are A through D, with various exponents on 10 and eV units.\n\nHmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) and the uncertainty in time (\u0394t) is on the order of \u0127 (h-bar), which is Planck's constant over 2\u03c0. So, the formula is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2 or something like that. Or maybe it's just \u0127, depending on the exact formulation.\n\nWait, the uncertainty principle is often written as \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. But sometimes, people use an approximate equality when considering the order of magnitude. So for our purposes, maybe I can take \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t.\n\nWait, but wait, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of the states, which would be the time uncertainty, right? Because the lifetime is how long the state exists before it decays or changes. So the time uncertainty \u0394t is related to the lifetime \u03c4. I think that \u0394t is about \u03c4, but perhaps it's more precise to say that \u0394t is approximately the lifetime. Or maybe \u0394t is something like half the lifetime, but I'm not sure. For the sake of this problem, I'll assume \u0394t is roughly the given lifetime.\n\nSo for each state, their energy uncertainty (\u0394E) would be \u0127 divided by their lifetime. Because \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/\u0394t, and \u0394t is the lifetime. So, for E1 with \u03c41 = 1e-9 sec, \u0394E1 is \u0127 / \u03c41. Similarly for E2, \u0394E2 is \u0127 / \u03c42.\n\nWait, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let's say the energy difference is \u0394E = E2 - E1. To clearly distinguish these two energy levels, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the two levels might not be resolvable\u2014they could blur together.\n\nWait, actually, I think the condition is that the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Or perhaps, the energy difference must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Alternatively, the combined uncertainty would be something else. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the uncertainty principle for the two states.\n\nWait, no. The energy difference between the two states is the key. Let's think about the energy resolution. To resolve two energy levels, their energy separation must be greater than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Because if the separation is too small, the lines (if you think of emission spectra) would overlap and not be distinguishable.\n\nSo, the condition for distinguishability is that the energy difference (\u0394E) between E2 and E1 should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, but wait, actually, each state has its own energy uncertainty.\n\nWait, no. Each state has its own lifetime, and thus its own energy uncertainty. The energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than either of the uncertainties, you can't tell them apart. Alternatively, maybe it's the maximum of the two uncertainties. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So for E1, \u0394E1 = \u0127/\u03c41, and for E2, \u0394E2 = \u0127/\u03c42. Since \u03c42 is larger than \u03c41, \u0394E2 is smaller than \u0394E1. So the larger uncertainty is from E1, which is \u0394E1 = \u0127/(1e-9). So if the energy difference between E2 and E1 is greater than this \u0394E1, then they can be distinguished.\n\nWait, no, because the energy difference \u0394E is E2 - E1. So the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two. Because each state's energy is uncertain by their respective \u0394E.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this. Let's think about the uncertainty in E2 and the uncertainty in E1. The energy difference \u0394E = E2 - E1. The uncertainty in \u0394E would be the square root of the sum of the squares of the uncertainties of E2 and E1. Because when you subtract two quantities, the uncertainties add in quadrature.\n\nSo, \u0394(\u0394E) = sqrt( (\u0394E2)^2 + (\u0394E1)^2 )\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the maximum of the two individual uncertainties. Because if \u0394E is greater than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, then it's definitely resolvable.\n\nWait, let's calculate the individual uncertainties. Let's compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nFirst, \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But since the options are in eV, perhaps it's easier to express \u0127 in eV\u00b7s.\n\nI remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 joules. So, converting \u0127 into eV\u00b7s:\n\n\u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nNow, compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 6.582e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 = \u0127 / \u03c42 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (1e-8 s) ) = 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 is approximately 6.58e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 is 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo for the energy difference \u0394E between E2 and E1 to be resolvable, it must be greater than the sum of these uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of them. Or maybe the sum.\n\nWait, but when you have two states with their own uncertainties, the uncertainty in their energy difference would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ), but since \u0394E1 is much larger than \u0394E2 (since 6.58e-7 is 10 times larger than 6.58e-8), the dominant term is \u0394E1.\n\nSo, the total uncertainty in the energy difference is approximately \u0394E1.\n\nWait, no, because if you have two independent uncertainties, when you subtract E1 from E2, the uncertainty is sqrt(\u0394E1\u00b2 + \u0394E2\u00b2). So in this case, \u0394E1 is 6.58e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 is 6.58e-8 eV. So the combined uncertainty would be sqrt( (6.58e-7)^2 + (6.58e-8)^2 ) \u2248 sqrt( (4.33e-13) + (4.33e-15) )) \u2248 sqrt(4.37e-13) \u2248 ~6.61e-7 eV.\n\nSo the combined uncertainty is about 6.61e-7 eV.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's overcomplicating. Maybe the main point is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of each state, but given that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then it's resolvable. Because the other uncertainty is smaller.\n\nWait, but in reality, the combined uncertainty would be the square root sum, but since \u0394E1 is much larger, the combined uncertainty is roughly \u0394E1.\n\nSo, for the energy difference to be clearly resolvable, it must be larger than the combined uncertainty. So, the energy difference \u0394E should be greater than 6.6e-7 eV.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001 * 1e-7 eV \u2192 0.001 * ~\u0394E2. So much smaller than \u0394E1. Not sufficient.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 way smaller than any of the uncertainties. No way.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 1e3 * 1e-7, so 1000 times larger than \u0394E1. So this would be resolvable.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 1e-8 is about 1/6.5 of 1e-7. So 0.15 times the \u0394E1. So the energy difference is 0.15 times the uncertainty. Not enough.\n\nSo, the correct option is C) 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The question says \"which could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved.\" So it's asking for a \u0394E that is larger than the uncertainty. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than 6.6e-7 eV. So yes, that would be resolvable.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels. The options are A to D with different eV values.\n\nHmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the lifetime of a state to the uncertainty in its energy. Oh right, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle! The formula I think is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy is known, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but in this case, the two states have different lifetimes. So their energy uncertainties would be different. For each state, the uncertainty \u0394E is approximately \u0127/(2\u0394t). Let me write that down.\n\nFor the first state with \u0394t1 = 1e-9 sec:\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2 * 1e-9)\n\nAnd for the second state with \u0394t2 = 1e-8 sec:\n\u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(2 * 1e-8)\n\nSo the uncertainty in energy for the second state is smaller because the lifetime is longer. But wait, when we talk about the energy difference between the two states, we need that difference to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainties might overlap, making it hard to distinguish the two levels.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should think about it differently. The energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in each state so that the two energy levels don't overlap in their possible energy ranges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or maybe just each uncertainty? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nLet me think again. The energy levels are E1 and E2, and their uncertainties are \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. For them to be distinguishable, the separation between E2 and E1 should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the separation is smaller than that, their energy ranges might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.\n\nSo, the condition would be |E2 - E1| > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: when you have two states, the energy difference must be such that the natural linewidths (which are proportional to 1/\u0394t) don't overlap. So the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties to avoid overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the uncertainty of each state individually. Hmm. Maybe I should calculate the uncertainties for each state and see.\n\nLet me compute the uncertainties.\n\nI know that \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But sometimes it's easier to use units of eV\u00b7s. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So let me convert \u0127 into eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. To convert to eV\u00b7s:\n\n\u0127 (eV\u00b7s) = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, using that, let's calculate \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t1) = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check that calculation.\n\n6.582e-16 divided by 2e-9 is the same as (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-16 +9 = 3.291 * 1e-7 eV, which is 3.291e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 is \u0127/(2\u0394t2) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) = 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Because \u0394t2 is 1e-8 seconds, so 2\u0394t2 is 2e-8. So 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582/2) * 1e-8 eV, which is 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nWait, no, wait. 1e-8 is 10^-8, so 2e-8 is 2 * 1e-8. So 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 is 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-8 eV. 6.582/2 is about 3.291, so 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. When you have \u0127/(2\u0394t), \u0394t is the lifetime, so for E1, \u0394t is 1e-9, so \u0394E1 is 6.582e-16 / (2e-9) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for E2, \u0394t is 1e-8, so \u0394E2 is 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) = 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nNow, the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties for them to be distinguishable. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the uncertainties might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.\n\nSo, the condition is |E2 - E1| > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nLet's compute \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\n3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.29e-7 + 0.329e-7 = 3.619e-7 eV.\n\nSo, the energy difference must be greater than approximately 3.6e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 \u2192 1e-9 is way smaller than 3.6e-7, so no.\n\nOption B: 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller, so no.\n\nOption C: 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV. Hmm, 0.0001 is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 100e-6, which is 100 times larger than 1e-4 eV? Wait, no, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So yes, this would satisfy the condition.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV \u2192 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 3.6e-7. Because 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV, which is much larger than 1e-8.\n\nWait, no, wait. 3.6e-7 is 3.6 * 1e-7, which is 0.00000036 eV. Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than 0.00000036 eV. So the energy difference is more than enough to be distinguished.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved.\" So the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. So any option that is larger than 3.6e-7 eV would work.\n\nLooking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7 (0.00000036). So option C would satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Are there any other considerations? For example, do we need to account for the relative uncertainties or something else? Or is this the correct approach?\n\nI think this is correct because the idea is that the energy difference should be larger than the combined uncertainties for the states to be distinguishable. So the correct option is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step. \n\nThe question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy and time. The formula I think is \u0394E \u00d7 \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. Or wait, sometimes it's written as \u0394E \u00d7 \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. So the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time has to be at least on the order of \u0127.\n\nWait, but in this case, the lifetimes of the states are given. I think the lifetime relates to the uncertainty in time. So \u0394t would be the lifetime of the state. Because if a state has a shorter lifetime, it's more uncertain in time, which would mean a larger uncertainty in energy, right? Or wait, no, because a shorter \u0394t would lead to a larger \u0394E. So if a state has a shorter lifetime, the energy uncertainty is bigger. So the energy difference between the two states must be larger than the uncertainty to be distinguishable.\n\nBut wait, the question is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So I think the energy difference (\u0394E) between E2 and E1 needs to be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Or maybe the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps each individually? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nLet me think again. Each state has its own lifetime, which gives its own energy uncertainty. So for the first state, E1, the lifetime is \u03c41 = 1e-9 sec. The uncertainty in energy \u0394E1 would be \u0127/(2 \u03c41). Similarly, for E2, \u03c42 =1e-8 sec, so \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2 \u03c42).\n\nBut how does that help in determining the difference between E2 and E1? Well, if the energy levels are too close, their uncertainties might overlap, making it hard to distinguish. So the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps. Or maybe each uncertainty is about the same, so the total uncertainty is about that, and the energy difference needs to be larger than that.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for the energy uncertainty. The energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So longer lifetimes mean smaller energy uncertainties. So the state with \u03c42 =1e-8 s has a smaller \u0394E than the state with \u03c41 =1e-9 s.\n\nWait, but each state's uncertainty is based on its own lifetime. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties, or the sum? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty associated with the measurement time. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the energy resolution required to distinguish the two levels.\n\nSo the energy difference \u0394E = E2 - E1 must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Wait, but each state has its own uncertainty. Or perhaps the energy resolution is given by the inverse of the time measurement. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties to be resolvable.\n\nWait, I think when you have two states, the minimum energy difference that can be distinguished is on the order of the uncertainty of the system. So perhaps we're looking for the energy difference to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties, or maybe the sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the measurement apparatus. But the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me think about the approach.\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that \u0394E \u00d7 \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately \u0127/(2 \u03c4), where \u03c4 is the lifetime.\n\nSo for E1: \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2 \u03c41) = (1.05e-34 J\u00b7s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) ) = 5.25e-26 J. Hmm, but I should convert this to eV because the options are in eV.\n\n1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So 5.25e-26 J /1.6e-19 J/eV \u2248 3.28e-7 eV. So about 3.3e-7 eV.\n\nFor E2: \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2 \u03c42) = (1.05e-34)/(2 *1e-8) )= 5.25e-27 J. Converting to eV: 5.25e-27 /1.6e-19 \u2248 3.28e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainties are about 3.3e-7 eV for E1 and 3.3e-8 eV for E2.\n\nWait, but the energy difference between E2 and E1 is what's important. Let's say E2 is higher than E1. So the energy difference \u0394E = E2 - E1 must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps each individual uncertainty.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the uncertainty associated with the measurement. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of one of the states. Or perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.\n\nWait, wait. The question is about being able to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of the system. But which uncertainty? Each state has its own.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the shorter-lived state, because that's the larger uncertainty. Because the shorter the lifetime, the larger the energy uncertainty. So if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two levels can be distinguished.\n\nSo the larger uncertainty is from E1, which is 3.3e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than 3.3e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, the choices are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, 1e-8 eV.\n\nWait, none of the options are above 1e-7 eV. Wait, the options are A:1e-9, B:1e-11, C:1e-4, D:1e-8.\n\nWait, the calculated uncertainty for E1 is about 3e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than 3e-7 eV to be distinguishable. But none of the options are that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate.\n\nCalculating \u0394E1: \u03c41 = 1e-9 s. So \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2 \u03c41).\n\n\u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo 1.05e-34 / (2 * 1e-9) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-9 = approximately 5.25e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 5.25e-26 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) = approx 3.28e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 is for \u03c42 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 = 1.05e-34/(2 *1e-8) = 5.25e-27 J \u2192 5.25e-27 /1.6e-19 = approx 3.28e-8 eV.\n\nSo E2's uncertainty is about 3.3e-8 eV, which is about 33 neV (nano-electron volts). E1's uncertainty is about 330 micro-eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of these two, perhaps. So the energy difference should be larger than 3.3e-7 eV. But the options are much smaller.\n\nWait, the options don't have anything near 3e-7 eV. The highest option is C) 1e-4 eV, which is 100 micro-eV, much larger than 330 micro-eV. So 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. So 3.3e-7 is 0.00000033 eV. So 1e-4 is much larger than that.\n\nWait, so if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than the uncertainties, then it's easily distinguishable. So option C is 1e-4 eV.\n\nBut why isn't the answer D? D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 10 neV. That's actually about the same order as E2's uncertainty (3.3e-8 eV), but a bit smaller.\n\nWait, wait. Let's think again. The energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state? Or perhaps the combined uncertainty.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives the uncertainty in energy for each state. To resolve two energy levels, their energies must be separated by more than the sum of their individual uncertainties, or perhaps more than the individual maximum uncertainty.\n\nWait, but each state's energy has an uncertainty. The energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties to be resolvable.\n\nSo sum of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2: 3.3e-7 + 3.3e-8 = 3.63e-7 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E should be > 3.6e-7 eV. So again, looking at the options, only option C is larger than that.\n\nWait, but option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 3.6e-7. So that would make the energy difference easily distinguishable.\n\nSo why is option C the correct choice?\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me think about the time aspect. The lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. The energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger energy uncertainty.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime because that's the larger uncertainty. So if \u0394E is larger than \u0394E1 (3.3e-7 eV), then the two levels can be distinguished.\n\nLooking at the options, only option C is larger than that.\n\nSo the correct answer would be C) 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the question says, \"the energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved.\" So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than the uncertainty of each state, then yes, it's clearly resolvable.\n\nSo the answer should be C.\n",

E1's uncertainty is about 330 micro-eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of these two, perhaps. So the energy difference should be larger than 3.3e-7 eV.

So 1e-4 is much larger than that.\n\nWait, so if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than the uncertainties, then it's easily distinguishable. So option C is 1e-4 eV.\n\nBut why isn't the answer D? D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 10 neV. That's actually about the same order as E2's uncertainty (3.3e-8 eV), but a bit smaller.\n\nWait, wait. Let's think again. The energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state? Or perhaps the combined uncertainty.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives the uncertainty in energy for each state.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.\n\nThe question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them that would allow us to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is at least h-bar over 2. So, \u0394E * \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. But wait, maybe in some contexts, people use \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(\u0394t) when \u0394t is the lifetime of the state. Because the lifetime is like the time uncertainty, right?\n\nSo the energy uncertainty \u0394E should be on the order of \u0127 divided by the lifetime. Because if the lifetime is shorter, the energy is more uncertain. So for each state, their energy uncertainties would be \u0127 divided by their respective lifetimes.\n\nWait, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the energy difference \u0394E = E2 - E1, I think. We need this \u0394E to be larger than the combined uncertainties of both states so that they can be resolved.\n\nSo each state has its own uncertainty. Let me compute those. Let's get the values. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s. But \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0), so approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to use eV\u00b7seconds for this. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So \u0127 in eV\u00b7s is approximately 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s. Yeah, I think that's right.\n\nSo for each state, \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t.\n\nFirst state has \u0394t1 = 1e-9 seconds. So \u0394E1 = \u0127 / 1e-9 \u2248 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.\n\nSecond state has \u0394t2 = 1e-8 seconds. \u0394E2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nWait, but the energy difference between E2 and E1 would need to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be resolved. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the two states might overlap in their energy ranges, making it hard to distinguish them.\n\nSo the minimum \u0394E needed is about \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nLet me calculate that. \u0394E1 is 6.582e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 is 6.582e-8 eV. Adding them together: 6.582e-7 + 0.6582e-7 = approximately 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nWait, wait, no, 6.582e-7 is 6.582 x 1e-7. And 6.582e-8 is 0.6582e-7. So adding them gives 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV. Hmm, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-7 eV \u2192 way smaller than 7.24e-7. So no, can't distinguish.\n\nOption B: 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller, so no.\n\nOption C: 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 which is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 7.24e-7. Because 1e-4 is 1e3 times bigger than 1e-7. So 1e-4 is 1000 x 7.24e-7 \u2192 0.724e-4. Wait, 7.24e-7 is 0.000000724 eV, and option C is 0.0001 eV, which is larger. So yes, this would be sufficient.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV \u2192 which is 1e-8, which is 0.1e-7. But our required \u0394E is about 7.24e-7, which is 72.4 times bigger. So option D is much smaller than needed.\n\nWait, but wait. Maybe I made a mistake here. Because the energy difference \u0394E is E2 - E1, which is the actual difference. But the uncertainty in each state is \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. So the energy difference between the two states should be at least the sum of their uncertainties to be distinguishable. So yes, the correct \u0394E should be greater than \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nSo looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4. Let me see: 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 1e3 times larger than 1e-7. So 1e-4 eV is way bigger than 7.24e-7 eV. So it's sufficient.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says: Two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find which energy difference allows us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that the product of the energy uncertainty and the time is on the order of \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. So, the energy uncertainty \u0394E is approximately \u0127/(2\u0394t), where \u0394t is the lifetime of the state.\n\nWait, but wait. I think the formula is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c4), where \u03c4 is the lifetime. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the smaller the energy uncertainty, right?\n\nSo, for each state, we can calculate the energy uncertainty. Let me calculate both. \n\nFirst, for the state with \u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds. The energy uncertainty \u0394E1 would be \u0127/(2*\u03c41). Similarly, for \u03c42 = 1e-8 seconds, \u0394E2 is \u0127/(2*\u03c42).\n\nBut wait, \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. I think I can use that value, but maybe I don't need to calculate the exact numbers because the options are in eV. Oh right, because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So I might need to convert units.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find a ratio instead of exact values. Let me think about the energy difference needed to resolve the two states. To clearly distinguish them, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, maybe? Or perhaps it's about the uncertainty in each state.\n\nWait, no, the energy difference between the two states must be larger than the uncertainty in their energies for them to be resolvable. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, then the measurements can't tell them apart. So, the energy difference \u0394E = |E2 - E1| must be greater than the uncertainty in each state's energy.\n\nWait, but each state has its own uncertainty. So the uncertainty in E1 is \u0394E1, and the uncertainty in E2 is \u0394E2. So the total uncertainty when considering both states might be the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or maybe it's the maximum of the two?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is that the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the two states could overlap in their energy ranges, making them indistinguishable.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy levels have certain lifetimes, which give them energy uncertainties. The energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be resolvable. Because if the energy difference is smaller than that sum, then the two energy levels' uncertainties would overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's that the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me look for a formula or principle.\n\nI recall that in energy level measurements, the precision required to resolve two levels is when the energy difference is greater than the combined uncertainty. So the condition is \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. Because each state has its own uncertainty, and to clearly separate them, the separation must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties.\n\nSo, let's compute the uncertainties. \n\nGiven \u03c41 = 1e-9 s, \u03c42 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u03c41)\n\u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u03c42)\n\nSince \u03c42 is larger than \u03c41, \u0394E2 is smaller than \u0394E1.\n\nSo the sum \u0394E1 + \u0394E2 would be roughly 2\u0394E1, because \u03c42 is ten times larger than \u03c41, so \u0394E2 is (1e-9)/(1e-8) = 1/10 of \u0394E1. So \u0394E2 = 0.1 \u0394E1, so sum is 1.1 \u0394E1.\n\nBut perhaps it's more precise to compute them numerically.\n\nLet me compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nFirst, compute \u0127 in eV\u00b7s. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, and \u0127 is 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0127 in eV\u00b7s is (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2 \u03c41) = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) ) = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 eV \u2248 3.291e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 = (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-8 ) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8 ) = 6.582e-8 / 2 = 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 is approximately 3.29e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nSo the sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than approximately 3.6e-7 eV for them to be distinguishable.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 1e-9 eV = 0.001e-7 eV \u2192 way smaller than 3.6e-7 eV.\n\nOption B: 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\n\nOption C: 1e-4 eV \u2192 which is 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 100e-6, which is 1e-4 eV is larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So 1e-4 is 1000 times larger than 3.6e-7, so yes, that's bigger.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.01e-7 eV, which is 0.01e-7 = 1e-9 eV? Wait, no. 1e-8 is 0.01e-7, which is 1e-8 eV. Which is smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So no, D is too small.\n\nSo the only option that's larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV is option C, which is 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV. Let me compute 3.6e-7 eV as 3.6e-7 eV is 0.36e-6 eV. So 1e-4 is 100e-6, which is 1e-4=100e-6=0.0001 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 100 times larger than 3.6e-7 eV (which is 3.6e-7=0.00000036 eV). So yes, 1e-4 is much larger.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option C.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because the sum would be more stringent. Let me think: if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the sum is automatically larger than the larger uncertainty. Because sum is larger than either individual term. So the condition would be that \u0394E > max(\u0394E1, \u0394E2). Let me compute that.\n\nThe maximum of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2 is \u0394E1 = 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nSo if the energy difference is larger than 3.29e-7 eV, then it's definitely larger than the sum as well, because sum is 3.6e-7, which is just a bit bigger than 3.29e-7.\n\nSo in that case, the energy difference needs to be larger than 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4=0.0001 eV, which is much bigger than 3.29e-7. So it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute the exact value of the required energy difference. Because the sum is 3.6e-7 eV, so the energy difference must be greater than that. So any option larger than that would work. Option C is 1e-4, which is way larger, so it's the only possible correct answer.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.000000001 eV \u2192 too small.\n\nB) 1e-11 \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 yes.\n\nD) 1e-8 \u2192 0.00000001 eV \u2192 smaller than 3.6e-7.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says: Two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find which energy difference allows us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that the product of the energy uncertainty and the time is on the order of \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. So, the energy uncertainty \u0394E is approximately \u0127/(2\u0394t), where \u0394t is the lifetime of the state.\n\nWait, but wait. I think the formula is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c4), where \u03c4 is the lifetime. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the smaller the energy uncertainty, right?\n\nSo, for each state, we can calculate the energy uncertainty. Let me calculate both. \n\nFirst, for the state with \u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds. The energy uncertainty \u0394E1 would be \u0127/(2*\u03c41). Similarly, for \u03c42 = 1e-8 seconds, \u0394E2 is \u0127/(2*\u03c42).\n\nBut wait, \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. I think I can use that value, but maybe I don't need to calculate the exact numbers because the options are in eV. Oh right, because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So I might need to convert units.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find a ratio instead of exact values. Let me think about the energy difference needed to resolve the two states. To clearly distinguish them, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, maybe? Or perhaps it's about the uncertainty in each state.\n\nWait, no, the energy difference between the two states must be larger than the uncertainty in their energies for them to be resolvable. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, then the measurements can't tell them apart. So, the energy difference \u0394E = |E2 - E1| must be greater than the uncertainty in each state's energy.\n\nWait, but each state has its own uncertainty. So the uncertainty in E1 is \u0394E1, and the uncertainty in E2 is \u0394E2. So the total uncertainty when considering both states might be the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or maybe it's the maximum of the two?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is that the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the two states could overlap in their energy ranges, making them indistinguishable.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy levels have certain lifetimes, which give them energy uncertainties. The energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be resolvable. Because if the energy difference is smaller than that sum, then the two energy levels' uncertainties would overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's that the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me look for a formula or principle.\n\nI recall that in energy level measurements, the precision required to resolve two levels is when the energy difference is greater than the combined uncertainty. So the condition is \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. Because each state has its own uncertainty, and to clearly separate them, the separation must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties.\n\nSo, let's compute the uncertainties. \n\nGiven \u03c41 = 1e-9 s, \u03c42 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u03c41)\n\u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u03c42)\n\nSince \u03c42 is larger than \u03c41, \u0394E2 is smaller than \u0394E1.\n\nSo the sum \u0394E1 + \u0394E2 would be roughly 2\u0394E1, because \u03c42 is ten times larger than \u03c41, so \u0394E2 is (1e-9)/(1e-8) = 1/10 of \u0394E1. So \u0394E2 = 0.1 \u0394E1, so sum is 1.1 \u0394E1.\n\nBut perhaps it's more precise to compute them numerically.\n\nLet me compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nFirst, compute \u0127 in eV\u00b7s. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, and \u0127 is 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0127 in eV\u00b7s is (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2 \u03c41) = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) ) = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 eV \u2248 3.291e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 = (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-8 ) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8 ) = 6.582e-8 / 2 = 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 is approximately 3.29e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nSo the sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than approximately 3.6e-7 eV for them to be distinguishable.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 1e-9 eV = 0.001e-7 eV \u2192 way smaller than 3.6e-7 eV.\n\nOption B: 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\n\nOption C: 1e-4 eV \u2192 which is 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 100e-6, which is 1e-4 eV is larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So 1e-4 is 1000 times larger than 3.6e-7, so yes, that's bigger.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.01e-7 eV, which is 0.01e-7 = 1e-9 eV? Wait, no. 1e-8 is 0.01e-7, which is 1e-8 eV. Which is smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So no, D is too small.\n\nSo the only option that's larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV is option C, which is 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV. Let me compute 3.6e-7 eV as 3.6e-7 eV is 0.36e-6 eV. So 1e-4 is 100e-6, which is 1e-4=100e-6=0.0001 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 100 times larger than 3.6e-7 eV (which is 3.6e-7=0.00000036 eV). So yes, 1e-4 is much larger.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option C.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because the sum would be more stringent. Let me think: if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the sum is automatically larger than the larger uncertainty. Because sum is larger than either individual term. So the condition would be that \u0394E > max(\u0394E1, \u0394E2). Let me compute that.\n\nThe maximum of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2 is \u0394E1 = 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nSo if the energy difference is larger than 3.29e-7 eV, then it's definitely larger than the sum as well, because sum is 3.6e-7, which is just a bit bigger than 3.29e-7.\n\nSo in that case, the energy difference needs to be larger than 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4=0.0001 eV, which is much bigger than 3.29e-7. So it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute the exact value of the required energy difference. Because the sum is 3.6e-7 eV, so the energy difference must be greater than that. So any option larger than that would work. Option C is 1e-4, which is way larger, so it's the only possible correct answer.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.000000001 eV \u2192 too small.\n\nB) 1e-11 \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 yes.\n\nD) 1e-8 \u2192 0.00000001 eV \u2192 smaller than 3.6e-7.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty for each state is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\tau},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{eV\u00b7s} \\) and \\( \\tau \\) is the lifetime of the state. For the two states:\n\n- For \\( \\tau_1 = 10^{-9} \\, \\text{s} \\), the energy uncertainty is:\n  \\[\n  \\Delta E_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16}}{2 \\times 10^{-9}} \\approx 3.29 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV}.\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( \\tau_2 = 10^{-8} \\, \\text{s} \\), the energy uncertainty is:\n  \\[\n  \\Delta E_2 = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16}}{2 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 3.29 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{eV}.\n  \\]\n\nTo clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \\( \\Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \\) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E > \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\Delta E_2 \\) is smaller than \\( \\Delta E_1 \\), the sum is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2 \\approx 3.29 \\times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \\times 10^{-8} \\approx 3.619 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the energy difference must be greater than \\( 3.619 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\). Now, we evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option A: \\( 10^{-9} \\, \\text{eV} \\)**  \n  \\( 10^{-9} \\, \\text{eV} = 0.001 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\), which is much smaller than \\( 3.619 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\). Not sufficient.\n\n- **Option B: \\( 10^{-11} \\, \\text{eV} \\)**  \n  \\( 10^{-11} \\, \\text{eV} = 0.0001 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\), which is even smaller than \\( 3.619 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with measurements. Oh right, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle! It states that you can't precisely know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously; the more you know one, the less you can know the other. But wait, how does that apply to energy and lifetime here?\n\nOh, right! There's an uncertainty in energy when the lifetime of a state is measured. The principle says that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0394E is the uncertainty in energy, \u0394t is the uncertainty in time (which here is the lifetime of the state), and \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant.\n\nSo, the lifetime here is like the \u0394t. The formula should be \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / (2\u0394t). Wait, but since the question is about the energy difference between the two states, E2 - E1, this difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for them to be distinguishable. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we can't tell them apart.\n\nWait, so the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty to be resolvable. So, let me compute the uncertainties for each state.\n\nWait, each state has its own lifetime. So, each will have its own energy uncertainty. But how does that affect the measurement of their energy difference? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the key is that the energy difference must be much larger than the uncertainties in each individual energy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference should be larger than the combined uncertainty? I'm a bit fuzzy on that part. Let's think.\n\nEach state has an uncertainty \u0394E_i = \u0127/(2\u0394t_i). So for E1, \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2*1e-9) and for E2, \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2*1e-8). Since the lifetimes are different, their uncertainties are different.\n\nWait, but when you're trying to measure the energy levels, the uncertainty in the energy difference would be something like the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or maybe the maximum of the two? Hmm, not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal energy difference that can be resolved is determined by the uncertainty in the system's measurement. So, the energy resolution \u0394E is determined by the instrument's time uncertainty \u0394t. So, if the instrument's time resolution is \u0394t, then \u0394E = \u0127/(2\u0394t). So, the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be greater than this \u0394E.\n\nWait, but in the question, the two states have different lifetimes. How does that affect the overall measurement? Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe the lifetimes are the \u0394t for each state, so the energy uncertainty for each is \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u0394t1) and \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u0394t2). The energy difference E2 - E1 needs to be larger than the sum of these two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the sum of the uncertainties, you can't tell if it's a single state with a wider uncertainty or two distinct states.\n\nSo, let's compute the sum of the uncertainties.\n\nWait, let's plug in the numbers. Let's calculate each \u0394E.\n\nFirst, the Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But since the options are in eV, I should probably convert everything into eV.\n\nWait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So, let me compute each \u0394E.\n\nFor E1: \u0394t1 = 1e-9 s.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u0394t1) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ) J.\n\nLet me compute that: 1.0545718e-34 / (2e-9) = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-25 J. Which is approximately 0.527e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J,\n\n\u0394E1 = 0.527e-25 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) = (0.527 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV.\n\n0.527 / 1.602 is about 0.329. So, 0.329e-6 eV, which is 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for E2, \u0394t2 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u0394t2) = 1.05457e-34 / (2 * 1e-8) = (1.05457 / 2) * 1e-26 J.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.527e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 0.527e-26 / 1.602e-19 = (0.527 / 1.602) * 1e-7 eV.\n\nAgain, 0.329e-7 eV, which is 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nSo, the uncertainties are \u0394E1 \u2248 3.29e-7 eV and \u0394E2 \u2248 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nNow, what's the combined uncertainty? If the energy difference is to be resolved, it should be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. So, sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.\n\nWait, but that's 3.6e-7 eV. Looking at the options, the only option larger than that is option C, 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, wait. Let me see the options again:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV\n\nB) 1e-11 eV\n\nC) 1e-4 eV\n\nD) 1e-8 eV\n\nWait, 3.6e-7 eV is 0.36e-6 eV. So, the energy difference needs to be larger than that. So, the energy difference must be greater than 3.6e-7 eV. Let's look at the options.\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV. That's 100e-6 eV, which is way bigger than 3.6e-7 eV. So, option C is way larger. So, it's resolvable.\n\nBut what about the other options? Let's see.\n\nOption D is 1e-8 eV. 1e-8 is 0.01e-6 eV. Our required minimum is 0.36e-6 eV. So 1e-8 is smaller than that. So, it's not enough. So D is too small.\n\nSimilarly, option A is 1e-9 eV, which is 0.001e-6 eV. Also too small.\n\nOption B is 1e-11, which is even smaller. So, only option C is bigger than the required 3.6e-7 eV.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Did I compute the uncertainties correctly? Let me double-check the math.\n\nHmm, let's compute \u0394E1 again. \u0394t1 is 1e-9 seconds.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u0394t1) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-9) = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-25 J.\n\nWait, 1e-34 / 1e-9 is 1e-25. So, yes, 0.527e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 0.527e-25 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) = (0.527 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV.\n\n0.527/1.602 \u2248 0.329. So 3.29e-7 eV. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 is for \u0394t2=1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 = 1.05e-34/(2e-8) = 0.525e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 0.525e-26 /1.602e-19 = (0.525 /1.602) * 1e-7 eV.\n\nAgain, 0.329e-7 eV, which is 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nSo, the sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV. So, E2-E1 must be greater than 3.6e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, only option C is higher. So, the correct answer should be option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with measurements. Oh right, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle! It states that you can't precisely know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously; the more you know one, the less you can know the other. But wait, how does that apply to energy and lifetime here?\n\nOh, right! There's an uncertainty in energy when the lifetime of a state is measured. The principle says that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0394E is the uncertainty in energy, \u0394t is the uncertainty in time (which here is the lifetime of the state), and \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant.\n\nSo, the lifetime here is like the \u0394t. The formula should be \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / (2\u0394t). Wait, but since the question is about the energy difference between the two states, E2 - E1, this difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for them to be distinguishable. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we can't tell them apart.\n\nWait, so the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty to be resolvable. So, let me compute the uncertainties for each state.\n\nWait, each state has its own lifetime. So, each will have its own energy uncertainty. But how does that affect the measurement of their energy difference? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the key is that the energy difference must be much larger than the uncertainties in each individual energy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference should be larger than the combined uncertainty? I'm a bit fuzzy on that part. Let's think.\n\nEach state has an uncertainty \u0394E_i = \u0127/(2\u0394t_i). So for E1, \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2*1e-9) and for E2, \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2*1e-8). Since the lifetimes are different, their uncertainties are different.\n\nWait, but when you're trying to measure the energy levels, the uncertainty in the energy difference would be something like the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or maybe the maximum of the two? Hmm, not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal energy difference that can be resolved is determined by the uncertainty in the system's measurement. So, the energy resolution \u0394E is determined by the instrument's time uncertainty \u0394t. So, if the instrument's time resolution is \u0394t, then \u0394E = \u0127/(2\u0394t). So, the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be greater than this \u0394E.\n\nWait, but in the question, the two states have different lifetimes. How does that affect the overall measurement? Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe the lifetimes are the \u0394t for each state, so the energy uncertainty for each is \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u0394t1) and \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u0394t2). The energy difference E2 - E1 needs to be larger than the sum of these two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the sum of the uncertainties, you can't tell if it's a single state with a wider uncertainty or two distinct states.\n\nSo, let's compute the sum of the uncertainties.\n\nWait, let's plug in the numbers. Let's calculate each \u0394E.\n\nFirst, the Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But since the options are in eV, I should probably convert everything into eV.\n\nWait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So, let me compute each \u0394E.\n\nFor E1: \u0394t1 = 1e-9 s.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u0394t1) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ) J.\n\nLet me compute that: 1.0545718e-34 / (2e-9) = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-25 J. Which is approximately 0.527e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J,\n\n\u0394E1 = 0.527e-25 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) = (0.527 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV.\n\n0.527 / 1.602 is about 0.329. So, 0.329e-6 eV, which is 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for E2, \u0394t2 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u0394t2) = 1.05457e-34 / (2 * 1e-8) = (1.05457 / 2) * 1e-26 J.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.527e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 0.527e-26 / 1.602e-19 = (0.527 / 1.602) * 1e-7 eV.\n\nAgain, 0.329e-7 eV, which is 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nSo, the uncertainties are \u0394E1 \u2248 3.29e-7 eV and \u0394E2 \u2248 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nNow, what's the combined uncertainty? If the energy difference is to be resolved, it should be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. So, sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.\n\nWait, but that's 3.6e-7 eV. Looking at the options, the only option larger than that is option C, 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, wait. Let me see the options again:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV\n\nB) 1e-11 eV\n\nC) 1e-4 eV\n\nD) 1e-8 eV\n\nWait, 3.6e-7 eV is 0.36e-6 eV. So, the energy difference needs to be larger than that. So, the energy difference must be greater than 3.6e-7 eV. Let's look at the options.\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV. That's 100e-6 eV, which is way bigger than 3.6e-7 eV. So, option C is way larger. So, it's resolvable.\n\nBut what about the other options? Let's see.\n\nOption D is 1e-8 eV. 1e-8 is 0.01e-6 eV. Our required minimum is 0.36e-6 eV. So 1e-8 is smaller than that. So, it's not enough. So D is too small.\n\nSimilarly, option A is 1e-9 eV, which is 0.001e-6 eV. Also too small.\n\nOption B is 1e-11, which is even smaller. So, only option C is bigger than the required 3.6e-7 eV.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Did I compute the uncertainties correctly? Let me double-check the math.\n\nHmm, let's compute \u0394E1 again. \u0394t1 is 1e-9 seconds.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u0394t1) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-9) = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-25 J.\n\nWait, 1e-34 / 1e-9 is 1e-25. So, yes, 0.527e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 0.527e-25 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) = (0.527 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV.\n\n0.527/1.602 \u2248 0.329. So 3.29e-7 eV. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 is for \u0394t2=1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 = 1.05e-34/(2e-8) = 0.525e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 0.525e-26 /1.602e-19 = (0.525 /1.602) * 1e-7 eV.\n\nAgain, 0.329e-7 eV, which is 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nSo, the sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV. So, E2-E1 must be greater than 3.6e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, only option C is higher.

So, the product of the energy uncertainty and the lifetime (time uncertainty) can't be too small.\n\nWait, but wait. The lifetime here refers to the lifetime of the state. So, the uncertainty in the lifetime is roughly the lifetime itself. So, the energy uncertainty \u0394E is approximately \u0127 divided by the lifetime.\n\nBut the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. For them to be distinguishable, their energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we can't tell them apart\u2014like, their energies would overlap in a measurement.\n\nSo, the energy difference \u0394E = E2 - E1 must be greater than the uncertainty of each state. Or wait, perhaps the uncertainty in each state is what determines whether the energy difference is resolvable. Hmm.\n\nLet me think. The uncertainty in the energy for each state is given by \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4, where \u03c4 is the lifetime. So for E1, \u03c4 is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, \u03c4 is 1e-8 seconds.\n\nWait, but when we have two states, each with their own lifetimes, how does that affect the energy difference? Oh, right, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or maybe the maximum of the two uncertainties.\n\nWait, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in each state. So, the energy difference should be bigger than the larger uncertainty between the two. Because if it's bigger than both, then we can resolve the two levels.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. Let's calculate the uncertainty for each state.\n\nFirst, \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But since the options are in eV, maybe it's easier to convert \u0127 into eV\u00b7s. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So, \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s. Yeah, I think that's right.\n\nSo, for E1, \u03c4 is 1e-9 s. So \u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c4 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV. Approximately 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nFor E2, \u03c4 is 1e-8 s. So \u0394E2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nWait, so the energy uncertainties are \u0394E1 \u2248 6.58e-7 eV and \u0394E2 \u2248 6.58e-8 eV. So the larger uncertainty is \u0394E1.\n\nSo the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps just larger than the larger one? I think for two states, the condition is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each. Because each state's energy is only known within their own uncertainty.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you have two states, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. Because if you have E1 \u00b1 \u0394E1 and E2 \u00b1 \u0394E2, then to have E2 - E1 > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, so that their intervals don't overlap.\n\nSo, the condition for distinguishability is \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nLet me compute that. \u0394E1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, \u0394E2 is 6.58e-8 eV. Adding them gives approximately 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo, the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be larger than about 7.24e-7 eV. Let me look at the options.\n\nOptions:\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 \u2192 smaller than 7e-7, no.\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 way too small.\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 1e-4 is much larger than 7e-7 (since 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 1e-7). So 1e-4 is way bigger than 7e-7. So option C is possible.\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.00001e-4 \u2192 smaller than 7e-7.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me compute the numbers more accurately.\n\n\u0394E1: 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV.\n\n\u0394E2: 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 is 6.58e-7, \u0394E2 is 0.658e-7. So sum is about 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nC) 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. Which is 1e-4 eV.

So for E1, \u03c4 is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, \u03c4 is 1e-8 seconds.\n\nWait, but when we have two states, each with their own lifetimes, how does that affect the energy difference? Oh, right, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or maybe the maximum of the two uncertainties.\n\nWait, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in each state. So, the energy difference should be bigger than the larger uncertainty between the two. Because if it's bigger than both, then we can resolve the two levels.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. Let's calculate the uncertainty for each state.\n\nFirst, \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But since the options are in eV, maybe it's easier to convert \u0127 into eV\u00b7s. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So, \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s. Yeah, I think that's right.\n\nSo, for E1, \u03c4 is 1e-9 s. So \u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c4 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV. Approximately 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nFor E2, \u03c4 is 1e-8 s. So \u0394E2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nWait, so the energy uncertainties are \u0394E1 \u2248 6.58e-7 eV and \u0394E2 \u2248 6.58e-8 eV. So the larger uncertainty is \u0394E1.\n\nSo the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps just larger than the larger one? I think for two states, the condition is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each. Because each state's energy is only known within their own uncertainty.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you have two states, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. Because if you have E1 \u00b1 \u0394E1 and E2 \u00b1 \u0394E2, then to have E2 - E1 > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, so that their intervals don't overlap.\n\nSo, the condition for distinguishability is \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nLet me compute that. \u0394E1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, \u0394E2 is 6.58e-8 eV. Adding them gives approximately 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo, the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be larger than about 7.24e-7 eV. Let me look at the options.\n\nOptions:\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 \u2192 smaller than 7e-7, no.\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 way too small.\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 1e-4 is much larger than 7e-7 (since 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 1e-7). So 1e-4 is way bigger than 7e-7. So option C is possible.\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.00001e-4 \u2192 smaller than 7e-7.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me compute the numbers more accurately.\n\n\u0394E1: 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV.\n\n\u0394E2: 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 is 6.58e-7, \u0394E2 is 0.658e-7. So sum is about 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nC) 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. Which is 1e-4 eV. Which is much larger than 7.24e-7. So that would satisfy the condition.\n\nThe other options are smaller. So the only possible correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the energy uncertainty (\\( \\Delta E \\)) to the lifetime (\\( \\tau \\)) of a state: \n\n\\[\n\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{eV\u00b7s} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.\n\nThe question says we have two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between the two energy levels. The options are A to D.\n\nWait, I remember that the uncertainty principle comes into play here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime (or the time over which the energy is measured) of a state.\n\nThe formula I think is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. Or wait, sometimes it's written as \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2, but for order of magnitude, the equality is good enough. \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant, which is about 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo, the uncertainty in energy \u0394E is approximately \u0127 divided by the lifetime \u0394t. So, \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t.\n\nBut wait, in this question, each state has its own lifetime. So for each state, the uncertainty in its energy is \u0127 divided by its own lifetime. So for state 1, \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / (1e-9 s), and for state 2, \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127 / (1e-8 s).\n\nBut the question is about the energy difference between the two states, E2 - E1, right? To clearly distinguish them, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the combined uncertainty, we can't be sure they're different.\n\nSo, the energy difference \u0394E_diff should be greater than (\u0394E1 + \u0394E2). Because if \u0394E_diff is bigger than that, the two levels are resolvable.\n\nLet me calculate each uncertainty.\n\nFirst, calculate \u0394E1:\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / (1e-9 s)\n\u0127 is about 1e-34 J\u00b7s. Wait, no, wait, 1e-34 is 1.054e-34, so let me use 1e-34 for approximation.\n\nSo \u0127 \u2248 1e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0394E1 = 1e-34 / 1e-9 = 1e-25 J.\n\nWait, but wait, that's in joules. I need to convert it to electron volts because the options are in eV.\n\nI remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 joules.\n\nSo to convert from J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.\n\nSo \u0394E1 in eV is (1e-25 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) \u2248 (1e-25) / (1.6e-19) \u2248 (1/1.6) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.625e-6 eV \u2248 6.25e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 is \u0127 / (1e-8 s) = 1e-34 / 1e-8 = 1e-26 J. Convert to eV:\n\n1e-26 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV \u2248 (1e-26)/(1.6e-19) \u2248 (1/1.6) * 1e-7 \u2248 0.625e-7 eV = 6.25e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainties are approximately 6.25e-7 eV and 6.25e-8 eV.\n\nThe sum of these uncertainties is 6.25e-7 + 6.25e-8 = 6.875e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than 6.875e-7 eV for the levels to be distinguishable.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 eV \u2192 way smaller than 6.8e-7, so no.\n\nOption B: 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller, so no.\n\nOption C: 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 1e4 * 1e-8. Hmm, 1e-4 is 10,000 times bigger than 6.8e-7. So this is much larger than needed. So yes, this would be resolvable.\n\nOption D: 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.1e-7 \u2192 0.1e-7 is 1e-8. 1e-8 is 0.1428 times 6.8e-7. So 0.14e-7 is less than 6.8e-7. So option D is 1e-8, which is smaller than 6.8e-7. So it wouldn't be enough.\n\nSo the only option larger than 6.8e-7 is option C, 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, \u0127 is about 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. Let me be more precise.\n\nFor E1's uncertainty:\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / (1e-9) \u2248 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.05e-25 / 1.6e-19 = (1.05 / 1.6) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.656e-6 eV = 6.56e-7 eV.\n\nFor E2's uncertainty:\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127 / (1e-8) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 (1.05 / 1.6) * 1e-7 \u2248 0.656e-7 eV = 6.56e-8 eV.\n\nSo sum is 6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8 = 7.216e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference should be larger than 7.2e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nC is 1e-4 eV which is 1e-4 = 1e4 * 1e-8 = 1e4 * 1e-8 = 1e-4. Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. So 1e-4 is much larger than 7.2e-7.\n\nSo option C is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but why is option D 1e-8 eV? That's 0.00000001 eV. Which is way less than 7.2e-7 (which is 0.00000072 eV). So 1e-8 is smaller, so D is not enough.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n",

The uncertainties in energy are calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta t_1} = \\frac{1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \\approx 1.05 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{J}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta t_2} = \\frac{1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \\approx 1.05 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nTo convert these uncertainties from joules to electron volts (1 eV = \\( 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{1.05 \\times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 6.56 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{1.05 \\times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 6.56 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{eV}\n\\]\n\nThe total uncertainty in energy is the sum of the individual uncertainties:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2 = 6.56 \\times 10^{-7} + 6.56 \\times 10^{-8} \\approx 7.216 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV}\n\\]\n\nTo clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \\( \\Delta E_{\\text{diff}} = E_2 - E_1 \\) must be greater than \\( \\Delta E_{\\text{total}} \\). Evaluating the options:\n\n- **Option A: \\( 10^{-9} \\, \\text{eV} \\)**  \n  \\( 10^{-9} \\, \\text{eV} \\) is much smaller than \\( 7.216 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\), so this is insufficient.\n\n- **Option B: \\( 10^{-11} \\, \\text{eV} \\)**  \n  \\( 10^{-11} \\, \\text{eV} \\) is even smaller than \\( 10^{-9} \\, \\text{eV} \\), so this is also insufficient.\n\n- **Option C: \\( 10^{-4} \\, \\text{eV} \\)**  \n  \\( 10^{-4} \\, \\text{eV} \\) is much larger than \\( 7.216 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\), so this is sufficient.\n\n- **Option D: \\( 10^{-8} \\, \\text{eV} \\)**  \n  \\( 10^{-8} \\, \\text{eV} \\) is smaller than \\( 7.216 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\), so this is insufficient.\n\nThe only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.  \n\nAnswer: C",
