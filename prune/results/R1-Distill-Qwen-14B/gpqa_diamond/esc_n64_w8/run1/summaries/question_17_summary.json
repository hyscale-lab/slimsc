      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where Ca-EDTA is present. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like Ca\u00b2+ pretty tightly.\n\nThe problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, stoichiometric means that the ratio is 1:1 between Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA, right? So each formula unit of the complex has one Ca\u00b2+ and one EDTA. So if the complex concentration is 0.02 M, does that mean the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ ions is much lower because most of the Ca is tied up in the complex?\n\nThey also give me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u21cc CaEDTA^2-, and Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]). \n\nBut wait, in this case, the solution has the complex already. So maybe I need to consider the dissociation of the complex. The dissociation reaction would be the reverse: CaEDTA^2- \u21cc Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4-. The equilibrium constant for dissociation would be the inverse of Kf. So K_dissociation = 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, Kf is formation constant, so the dissociation constant Kd is 1/Kf. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. So that's the K for the dissociation.\n\nNow, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's call the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ as x. Since the dissociation reaction produces one Ca\u00b2+ and one EDTA per complex, the concentration of EDTA from dissociation is also x. But wait, in reality, the concentration of free EDTA might not be exactly x because some comes from the dissociation. However, given that Kf is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable. That means the amount of dissociation is very small. So x should be much smaller than 0.02 M.\n\nSo we can approximate that the concentration of the complex remains approximately 0.02 M. Therefore, the dissociation expression is:\n\nKd = [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA] / [CaEDTA^2-] \u2248 (x)(x) / 0.02 \u2248 x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 2e-11.\n\nSo solving for x\u00b2: x\u00b2 = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.\n\nWait, wait, no, because Kd is 2e-11. So x\u00b2 = Kd * [CaEDTA^2-] = 2e-11 * 0.02. Let me compute that: 2e-11 * 0.02 is 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) which is 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7. Because 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7, so 2 times that is 6.32e-7.\n\nWait, let me double-check. 10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-6 is 1e-6. So 10^-6.5 is sqrt(1e-6 * 1e-7) )= sqrt(1e-13) )= 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 times that is 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but why is the EDTA concentration also x? Because each dissociated complex gives one EDTA^4- and one Ca\u00b2+. But wait, in reality, the EDTA comes from two sources: some from the dissociation and some from the complex itself. But because the complex is stable, the amount of free EDTA is very low, so the majority is bound. But in this case, since the Kd is small, the [EDTA] is approximately x, because the complex is so stable that almost nothing dissociates.\n\nSo I think my approach is correct. So the free Ca\u00b2+ concentration is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.\n",

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, it binds to metal ions like calcium. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10, and we're supposed to find the concentration of free calcium ions. \n\nWait, I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the concentration of the free ions can be really low because the complex is very stable, especially if the formation constant (K) is large. So in this case, the K is 5e10, which is a big number. That means the complex is really stable, so most of the calcium should be tied up in the complex, leaving a small amount of free Ca\u00b2+ ions.\n\nThe formula I think I need is from the formation constant equation. The formation constant Kf is equal to [Ca-EDTA] / ( [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-] ). But wait, in this case, the problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, meaning the concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- before complexation are equal, right? Because for each Ca\u00b2+, one EDTA^4- binds.\n\nBut wait, when they form the complex, the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- would be very low. Let me think about the initial setup. The total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. \n\nThe formation constant equation is K = [CaEDTA] / ( [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA] ). But since the solution is stoichiometric, the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are the same. Let's call them both 'x'. So when they form the complex, the complex's concentration is 0.02 M. But wait, wait. Let me make sure. The stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, so for every mole of Ca\u00b2+ that reacts with EDTA, you get one mole of the complex.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The initial concentrations before complex formation would be [Ca\u00b2+] and [EDTA^4-], which are both 'x' each. When they react, they form the complex. So the reaction is Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA^2-.\n\nThe formation constant K = [CaEDTA] / ( [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-] ) = 5e10.\n\nBut after complex formation, the concentration of [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M. So let's say the total concentration is 0.02 M, which is all the complex. Because if the solution is stoichiometric, I think that all the Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA have been consumed to form the complex. Wait, no, that can't be. Because the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, but that doesn't necessarily mean all the Ca and EDTA are in the complex. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is made by adding Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA such that they form the complex. So the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are both 'c', and they form the complex. So [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. But wait, the formation is reversible, so some Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA remain uncomplexed.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should model this using the K expression. Let me denote [Ca\u00b2+] as x, [EDTA^4-] as y. Then the K is 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * y). But because the solution is stoichiometric, the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps we can assume that x \u2248 y because they are in a 1:1 ratio. Or wait, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total concentration of Ca is the sum of free Ca\u00b2+ and the complex. But the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. So the total Ca in solution is 0.02 M, because each complex has one Ca\u00b2+.\n\nWait, that's a good point. The total concentration of calcium is 0.02 M. So the total [Ca\u00b2+] is [free Ca\u00b2+] + [Ca in complex] = [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaEDTA]. But wait, [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M, but each of those has one Ca\u00b2+ ion. So the total Ca\u00b2+ is [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaEDTA] = [Ca\u00b2+] + 0.02. But wait, that can't be, because [CaEDTA] is the concentration of the complex, which contains the Ca\u00b2+.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which represents the amount of Ca\u00b2+ that's bound. So the total Ca\u00b2+ is the sum of free Ca\u00b2+ and the Ca in the complex. But that can't be because the complex is formed from the Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let's approach it differently. Let me consider that the initial solution has 0.02 M of the complex. So [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. The complex dissociates slightly into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nSo the dissociation is CaEDTA^2- \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4-.\n\nThe formation constant K is 5e10, so the dissociation constant would be 1/K = 2e-11.\n\nWait, no. The formation constant is K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). The dissociation would be the reverse, so the K_dissociation (Kd) is 1/K = 2e-11.\n\nSo the dissociation equation is: CaEDTA^2- \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4-, with Kd = 2e-11.\n\nLet me denote the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, assuming that the dissociation is small and that the initial concentrations are about 0.02 M.\n\nWait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, then the initial concentration before dissociation is 0.02. So when it dissociates, some x amount dissociates, so [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [EDTA] = x, and [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x.\n\nBut since Kd is 2e-11, which is very small, x would be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 2e-11.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.\n\nx = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no: sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4*(1e-13), so square root is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13)=2 *1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7.\n\nSo x = approximately 6.32e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That matches.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Kd is 2e-11. The equation is x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 2e-11 \u2192 x\u00b2=0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 \u2192 which is 2*(1e-6.5). Let me compute 1e-6.5: 6.5 is 6 and a half, so 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 1e-7. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7, which rounds to 6.3e-7, option C.\n\nSo the answer should be C.\n",

Wait, no, that can't be. Because the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, but that doesn't necessarily mean all the Ca and EDTA are in the complex. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is made by adding Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA such that they form the complex. So the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are both 'c', and they form the complex. So [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. But wait, the formation is reversible, so some Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA remain uncomplexed.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should model this using the K expression. Let me denote [Ca\u00b2+] as x, [EDTA^4-] as y. Then the K is 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * y). But because the solution is stoichiometric, the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps we can assume that x \u2248 y because they are in a 1:1 ratio. Or wait, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total concentration of Ca is the sum of free Ca\u00b2+ and the complex. But the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. So the total Ca in solution is 0.02 M, because each complex has one Ca\u00b2+.\n\nWait, that's a good point. The total concentration of calcium is 0.02 M. So the total [Ca\u00b2+] is [free Ca\u00b2+] + [Ca in complex] = [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaEDTA]. But wait, [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M, but each of those has one Ca\u00b2+ ion. So the total Ca\u00b2+ is [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaEDTA] = [Ca\u00b2+] + 0.02. But wait, that can't be, because [CaEDTA] is the concentration of the complex, which contains the Ca\u00b2+.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which represents the amount of Ca\u00b2+ that's bound. So the total Ca\u00b2+ is the sum of free Ca\u00b2+ and the Ca in the complex. But that can't be because the complex is formed from the Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let's approach it differently. Let me consider that the initial solution has 0.02 M of the complex. So [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. The complex dissociates slightly into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nSo the dissociation is CaEDTA^2- \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4-.\n\nThe formation constant K is 5e10, so the dissociation constant would be 1/K = 2e-11.\n\nWait, no. The formation constant is K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). The dissociation would be the reverse, so the K_dissociation (Kd) is 1/K = 2e-11.\n\nSo the dissociation equation is: CaEDTA^2- \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4-, with Kd = 2e-11.\n\nLet me denote the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, assuming that the dissociation is small and that the initial concentrations are about 0.02 M.\n\nWait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, then the initial concentration before dissociation is 0.02. So when it dissociates, some x amount dissociates, so [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [EDTA] = x, and [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x.\n\nBut since Kd is 2e-11, which is very small, x would be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 2e-11.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.\n\nx = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no: sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4*(1e-13), so square root is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13)=2 *1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7.\n\nSo x = approximately 6.32e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That matches.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Kd is 2e-11. The equation is x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 2e-11 \u2192 x\u00b2=0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 \u2192 which is 2*(1e-6.5). Let me compute 1e-6.5: 6.5 is 6 and a half, so 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 1e-7. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7, which rounds to 6.3e-7, option C.\n\nSo the answer should be C.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca\u00b2\u207a]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \\leftrightarrow \\text{Ca}^{2+} + \\text{EDTA}^{4-}\n\\]\n\nThe dissociation constant \\( K_d \\) is the reciprocal of the formation constant \\( K_f \\), so:\n\n\\[\nK_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}.\n\\]\n\nLet the concentration of free calcium ions be \\( x \\). Since the dissociation of the complex is very small (due to the large \\( K_f \\)), the concentration of the complex remains approximately 0.02 M. The equilibrium expression is:\n\n\\[\nK_d = \\frac{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}.\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\( [\\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x \\) and \\( [\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \\approx 0.02 \\), we substitute into the equation:\n\n\\[\nK_d = \\frac{x^2}{0.02}.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 = K_d \\cdot 0.02 = (2 \\times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \\times 10^{-13}.\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 10^{-6.5} \\approx 3.16 \\times 10^{-7} \\), we find:\n\n\\[\nx \\approx 2 \\times 3.16 \\times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \\( 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M} \\), which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The question says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. I think the formula for the formation of the complex might be involved here.\n\nWait, the problem gives the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal ion and EDTA combine to form the complex. The reaction is something like Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA^2-.\n\nSo the formula for Kf is [CaEDTA^2-] divided by ([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I think that means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M.\n\nBut wait, in solution, some of the EDTA might be free EDTA^4- and some might be tied up in the complex. Oh, but wait, in the presence of excess EDTA, almost all the Ca\u00b2+ would be complexed. But here, the concentration of the complex is given. So perhaps we can assume that all the EDTA is in the form of the complex. No, that's not right. Because EDTA can exist in different protonated forms depending on pH. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so maybe we can assume that EDTA is predominantly in the Y^4- form. Oh wait, wait, the problem says \"we assume that the pH is ideal\"\u2014so I don't have to worry about the alpha fraction or anything. So all the EDTA is Y^4-.\n\nWait, but in that case, the reaction is Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4- \u2194 CaY\u00b2\u2212. The Kf is given as 5e10. So the expression is Kf = [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]).\n\nBut the problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M. So if all the EDTA is in Y^4- form, then [Y^4\u2212] = 0.02 M? No, wait. Because the initial solution has some Ca\u00b2+ and some EDTA. Wait, no, the complex is formed from Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA, so the total concentration of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA might be involved.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let's think about it. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M.\n\nBut what about the concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4-? Let's denote [Ca\u00b2+] as x and [Y^4\u2212] as y. According to the formation constant equation:\n\nKf = [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/( [Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212] ) \u2192 5e10 = (0.02)/(x * y )\n\nBut what's the relationship between x and y? Wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1, so for every mole of CaY\u00b2\u2212, one mole of Ca\u00b2+ and one mole of Y^4\u2212 were used. Wait, no. Wait, the complex is formed by the reaction: Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212 \u2192 CaY\u00b2\u2212. So the initial concentrations would be [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [Y^4\u2212] = y, and [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02.\n\nBut wait, if the solution is made by adding Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212, and they form the complex, but here it's given that the solution already contains the complex. So perhaps the initial concentrations are such that [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02, and [Ca\u00b2+] and [Y^4\u2212] are the free ions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex. In that case, the concentration of the complex would be 0.02 M, and the free Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA (Y^4\u2212) would be determined by the Kf.\n\nWait, but if the Ca-EDTA complex is dissolved, it dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212. So the initial concentration is [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M, but upon dissociation, some of that dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212.\n\nWait, but if Kf is very large (5e10), that suggests that the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. So [Ca\u00b2+] and [Y^4\u2212] would be very small.\n\nWait, but Kf is given as 5e10, which is a large number, so the reaction favors the formation of the complex. So the concentrations of free Ca\u00b2+ and free Y^4\u2212 would be very low.\n\nBut the problem is to find the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca\u00b2+].\n\nSo, using the equation:\n\nKf = [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/( [Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212] )\n\nWe can write:\n\n5e10 = 0.02/( [Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212] )\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212] = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13.\n\nBut wait, without more information, how can I find [Ca\u00b2+]?\n\nAh, perhaps I can make an assumption. Since Kf is very large, the dissociation is small, so the concentration of the complex is almost equal to the initial concentration. But that's already given.\n\nWait, another thought: if the complex is 0.02 M, and the stoichiometry is 1:1, then the total concentration of Ca\u00b2+ in solution is [Ca\u00b2+] (free) plus [CaY\u00b2\u2212] (complexed). But wait, no, because the complex is 0.02 M. So the total Ca\u00b2+ is [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M? No, wait, no, because the complex is formed from Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA. So the total concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is [Ca\u00b2+] (free) plus [CaY\u00b2\u2212] (which is 0.02 M). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because [CaY\u00b2\u2212] is the concentration of the complex, which includes the Ca\u00b2+ in the complex. So the total Ca is [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = initial concentration of Ca, but in this case, we're told that the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. So perhaps the initial solution is made by dissolving the complex, so [CaY\u00b2\u2212] is 0.02 M, and the free [Ca\u00b2+] is what we need to find.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Since the complex is 0.02 M, and the Kf is 5e10, which is very large, the free [Ca\u00b2+] is negligible compared to the complex. So [Ca\u00b2+] is approximately equal to (0.02) / (Kf * [Y^4\u2212]). Wait, but I don't have [Y^4\u2212].\n\nWait, another approach: Let's think about the complex as being in equilibrium. The complex dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212, but since Kf is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So [Ca\u00b2+] and [Y^4\u2212] are very small.\n\nLet me denote [Ca\u00b2+] = x and [Y^4\u2212] = y. Then, from the Kf equation:\n\nx * y = (0.02) / (5e10) = 4e-13.\n\nBut without another equation, I can't find x and y separately. So I need another relationship. Wait, perhaps the stoichiometry of the reaction gives another equation. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so the total Ca comes from the complex. So [Ca\u00b2+] (free) + [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M. But [CaY\u00b2\u2212] is 0.02 M, so [Ca\u00b2+] (free) is 0.02 - 0.02? No, that can't be. Wait, no, that's not right. Because [CaY\u00b2\u2212] is 0.02 M, which includes all the Ca\u00b2+ that's complexed. So the free [Ca\u00b2+] is x, and the total Ca is x + 0.02 = initial concentration of Ca\u00b2+ added. But if the solution is made by dissolving the complex, the initial Ca\u00b2+ comes from the complex. So maybe the total Ca is 0.02 M (the complex), so the free Ca\u00b2+ is x, and the complex is 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 because x is very small. So x is negligible compared to 0.02.\n\nSo we can approximate [Ca\u00b2+] \u2248 x, and [Y^4\u2212] \u2248 y. But without another equation, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps in the solution, the total concentration of EDTA is equal to the concentration of the complex, because each complex contains one EDTA. So [EDTA] = [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M. But then, the EDTA can be in either Y^4\u2212 or other protonated forms. Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, so we can assume that all EDTA is in Y^4\u2212 form. So [Y^4\u2212] = 0.02 M?\n\nWait, that can't be right because if [Y^4\u2212] is 0.02 M, then x * 0.02 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = 4e-13 / 0.02 \u2192 x = 2e-11 M. But wait, that would make [Ca\u00b2+] very small, like 2e-11 M. But that's not one of the options. The options are 2e-2, 5e-3, 6.3e-7, 1e-2.\n\nHmm, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and that's the only source of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA. So the total EDTA concentration is 0.02 M as well. So the total EDTA is [Y^4\u2212] + [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M. But wait, if [CaY\u00b2\u2212] is 0.02 M, then [Y^4\u2212] would be 0, which doesn't make sense. So I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the dissociation. The complex dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA produced. So:\n\nCaY\u00b2\u2212 \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212\n\nAt equilibrium, [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since x is small), [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [Y^4\u2212] = x.\n\nSo substituting into the Kf expression:\n\nKf = [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/( [Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212] ) \u2192 5e10 = (0.02)/(x * x ) \u2192 5e10 = 0.02/(x\u00b2) \u2192 x\u00b2 = 0.02/(5e10) \u2192 x\u00b2 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) \u2192 x = 2e-6.5 \u2192 Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let's calculate that.\n\nWait, sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) ) = 2 * 1e-6.5 \u2192 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 \u2248 6.32e-7. So x \u2248 6.3e-7 M.\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] = x \u2248 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That seems to fit.\n\nSo the answer should be option C.\n",

According to the formation constant equation:\n\nKf = [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/( [Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212] ) \u2192 5e10 = (0.02)/(x * y )\n\nBut what's the relationship between x and y? Wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1, so for every mole of CaY\u00b2\u2212, one mole of Ca\u00b2+ and one mole of Y^4\u2212 were used. Wait, no. Wait, the complex is formed by the reaction: Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212 \u2192 CaY\u00b2\u2212. So the initial concentrations would be [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [Y^4\u2212] = y, and [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02.\n\nBut wait, if the solution is made by adding Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212, and they form the complex, but here it's given that the solution already contains the complex. So perhaps the initial concentrations are such that [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02, and [Ca\u00b2+] and [Y^4\u2212] are the free ions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex. In that case, the concentration of the complex would be 0.02 M, and the free Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA (Y^4\u2212) would be determined by the Kf.\n\nWait, but if the Ca-EDTA complex is dissolved, it dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212. So the initial concentration is [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M, but upon dissociation, some of that dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212.\n\nWait, but if Kf is very large (5e10), that suggests that the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. So [Ca\u00b2+] and [Y^4\u2212] would be very small.\n\nWait, but Kf is given as 5e10, which is a large number, so the reaction favors the formation of the complex. So the concentrations of free Ca\u00b2+ and free Y^4\u2212 would be very low.\n\nBut the problem is to find the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca\u00b2+].\n\nSo, using the equation:\n\nKf = [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/( [Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212] )\n\nWe can write:\n\n5e10 = 0.02/( [Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212] )\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212] = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13.\n\nBut wait, without more information, how can I find [Ca\u00b2+]?\n\nAh, perhaps I can make an assumption. Since Kf is very large, the dissociation is small, so the concentration of the complex is almost equal to the initial concentration. But that's already given.\n\nWait, another thought: if the complex is 0.02 M, and the stoichiometry is 1:1, then the total concentration of Ca\u00b2+ in solution is [Ca\u00b2+] (free) plus [CaY\u00b2\u2212] (complexed). But wait, no, because the complex is 0.02 M. So the total Ca\u00b2+ is [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M? No, wait, no, because the complex is formed from Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA. So the total concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is [Ca\u00b2+] (free) plus [CaY\u00b2\u2212] (which is 0.02 M). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because [CaY\u00b2\u2212] is the concentration of the complex, which includes the Ca\u00b2+ in the complex. So the total Ca is [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = initial concentration of Ca, but in this case, we're told that the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. So perhaps the initial solution is made by dissolving the complex, so [CaY\u00b2\u2212] is 0.02 M, and the free [Ca\u00b2+] is what we need to find.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Since the complex is 0.02 M, and the Kf is 5e10, which is very large, the free [Ca\u00b2+] is negligible compared to the complex. So [Ca\u00b2+] is approximately equal to (0.02) / (Kf * [Y^4\u2212]). Wait, but I don't have [Y^4\u2212].\n\nWait, another approach: Let's think about the complex as being in equilibrium. The complex dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212, but since Kf is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So [Ca\u00b2+] and [Y^4\u2212] are very small.\n\nLet me denote [Ca\u00b2+] = x and [Y^4\u2212] = y. Then, from the Kf equation:\n\nx * y = (0.02) / (5e10) = 4e-13.\n\nBut without another equation, I can't find x and y separately. So I need another relationship. Wait, perhaps the stoichiometry of the reaction gives another equation. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so the total Ca comes from the complex. So [Ca\u00b2+] (free) + [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M. But [CaY\u00b2\u2212] is 0.02 M, so [Ca\u00b2+] (free) is 0.02 - 0.02? No, that can't be. Wait, no, that's not right. Because [CaY\u00b2\u2212] is 0.02 M, which includes all the Ca\u00b2+ that's complexed. So the free [Ca\u00b2+] is x, and the total Ca is x + 0.02 = initial concentration of Ca\u00b2+ added. But if the solution is made by dissolving the complex, the initial Ca\u00b2+ comes from the complex. So maybe the total Ca is 0.02 M (the complex), so the free Ca\u00b2+ is x, and the complex is 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 because x is very small. So x is negligible compared to 0.02.\n\nSo we can approximate [Ca\u00b2+] \u2248 x, and [Y^4\u2212] \u2248 y. But without another equation, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps in the solution, the total concentration of EDTA is equal to the concentration of the complex, because each complex contains one EDTA. So [EDTA] = [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M. But then, the EDTA can be in either Y^4\u2212 or other protonated forms. Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, so we can assume that all EDTA is in Y^4\u2212 form. So [Y^4\u2212] = 0.02 M?\n\nWait, that can't be right because if [Y^4\u2212] is 0.02 M, then x * 0.02 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = 4e-13 / 0.02 \u2192 x = 2e-11 M. But wait, that would make [Ca\u00b2+] very small, like 2e-11 M. But that's not one of the options. The options are 2e-2, 5e-3, 6.3e-7, 1e-2.\n\nHmm, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and that's the only source of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA. So the total EDTA concentration is 0.02 M as well. So the total EDTA is [Y^4\u2212] + [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M. But wait, if [CaY\u00b2\u2212] is 0.02 M, then [Y^4\u2212] would be 0, which doesn't make sense. So I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the dissociation. The complex dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA produced. So:\n\nCaY\u00b2\u2212 \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212\n\nAt equilibrium, [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since x is small), [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [Y^4\u2212] = x.\n\nSo substituting into the Kf expression:\n\nKf = [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/( [Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212] ) \u2192 5e10 = (0.02)/(x * x ) \u2192 5e10 = 0.02/(x\u00b2) \u2192 x\u00b2 = 0.02/(5e10) \u2192 x\u00b2 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) \u2192 x = 2e-6.5 \u2192 Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let's calculate that.\n\nWait, sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) ) = 2 * 1e-6.5 \u2192 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 \u2248 6.32e-7. So x \u2248 6.3e-7 M.\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] = x \u2248 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That seems to fit.\n\nSo the answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca\u00b2\u207a]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY\u00b2\u207b), we use the formation constant \\( K_f \\), which is given as \\( 5 \\times 10^{10} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25\u00b0C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nHmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant (K) tells us how stable the complex is. A high K means the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ ions should be low.\n\nWait, the formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u21cc CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212, right? So the expression for K would be [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212]) = K.\n\nIn this problem, the solution has a 0.02 M concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, initially, I think that the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] is 0.02 M. But wait, that's assuming that all the EDTA and Ca\u00b2+ are tied up in the complex, which might not be the case. Oh, but the question says \"stoichiometric,\" which probably means that the moles are in the correct ratio, so the EDTA and Ca are present in a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, not entirely sure, but let's proceed.\n\nSo, the complex dissociates a little into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-. The K is given as 5e10, which is a huge number, so the dissociation is minimal. That means the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ will be very low.\n\nLet me set up the variables. Let's say the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, assuming that the dissociation is the same for both. Because the complex dissociates into one Ca\u00b2+ and one EDTA^4-.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so if it dissociates by x, then the concentration of the complex would be 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, x will be very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] \u2248 0.02 M.\n\nSo, the K expression is K = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]) \u2248 (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02/(x\u00b2) = 5e10.\n\nSo, solving for x\u00b2: x\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.\n\nWait, wait, let me re-calculate that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12. Because 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12. 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 is 4e-13? Wait, no, wait. 2e-2 is 2 x 10^-2. 5e10 is 5 x 10^10. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 10^(-2 -10) = 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. Because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13. So x is 2e-6.5. Hmm, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 6.5 is halfway, so 3.16e-7. Wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7.\n\nSo x = 2 * 3.16e-7 \u2248 6.32e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches this. So the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the setup. Another approach: The formation constant is K = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212]). But in a solution with only the complex, the EDTA is all tied up except for a little from dissociation.\n\nWait, but the initial concentration is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So if it dissociates, [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02. So K \u2248 0.02/(x\u00b2) = 5e10 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2 /5e10 = 4e-13 \u2192 x= sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5.\n\nWait, another way: 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2. So x is 2e-6.5 = approximately 6.3e-7 M. That's option C.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium.\n\nThe problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25\u00b0C. They give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct concentration of calcium ions.\n\nWait, okay, I think I need to recall the concept of formation constants. The formation constant, Kf, represents the equilibrium between a metal ion and EDTA, forming the complex. The formula for Kf is [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). So the complex dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nBut wait, wait. EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so in solution, it's usually in various protonated forms. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so I guess we don't have to worry about that. They've probably considered that the pH is such that EDTA is in its correct form to bind Ca\u00b2+ effectively, so all the EDTA is available as Y^4-.\n\nSo the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. Let me think, if the complex dissociates, then the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ would be related to the Kf.\n\nBut wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So that's the concentration of the complex. Let's denote the complex as CaY\u00b2- (if EDTA is Y^4- and Ca is Ca\u00b2+). So the initial concentration of CaY\u00b2- is 0.02 M.\n\nAt equilibrium, some of this complex might dissociate. Let's model that. The dissociation reaction is:\n\nCaY\u00b2- \u21cc Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4-\n\nThe formation constant Kf is [CaY\u00b2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.\n\nWait, but in solution, the total concentration of EDTA is not just the free Y^4-; it's the sum of all EDTA species. But wait, the problem says the pH is ideal, so I think that [Y^4-] is equal to the total EDTA concentration because all the EDTA is in that form. Or wait, no. Because the solution is in stoichiometric amounts of Ca and EDTA. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the total concentrations.\n\nWait, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, let me think about the dissociation. Let me let x be the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ that dissociates. So, when the complex dissociates, each mole of CaY\u00b2- gives one mole of Ca\u00b2+ and one mole of Y^4-.\n\nBut wait, initially, the solution is only 0.02 M CaY\u00b2-, so the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4- are zero. Wait, no, because in solution, the complex can't be 100% dissociated due to the high Kf. Wait, no, Kf is very large, so the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal.\n\nWait, no. Wait, Kf is the formation constant, which is a large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So the degree of dissociation would be very low. So, the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ would be very small.\n\nWait, but let me model this. Let me set up an ICE table.\n\nInitial concentrations:\n[CaY\u00b2-] = 0.02 M\n[Ca\u00b2+] = 0\n[Y^4-] = 0\n\nChange:\n[CaY\u00b2-] decreases by x, so becomes 0.02 - x\n[Ca\u00b2+] increases by x, so becomes x\n[Y^4-] increases by x, so becomes x\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are:\n[CaY\u00b2-] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since x is small)\n[Ca\u00b2+] = x\n[Y^4-] = x\n\nThe Kf expression is:\n\nKf = [CaY\u00b2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4-]) = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10.\n\nSo, solving for x:\n\n0.02/(x^2) = 5e10 \u2192 x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) \u2192 x^2 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) \u2192 x = 2e-6.5 \u2192 wait, 4e-13 is 4 times 1e-13, so sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again.\n\nWait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So, (2e-2) / (x^2) = 5e10 \u2192 x^2 = (2e-2)/(5e10) \u2192 2/(5) is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13. So x^2=4e-13 \u2192 x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12. Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Because (2e-6.5)^2 is (2^2)*(1e-13) =4e-13.\n\nWait, 10^(-6.5) is 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = approximately 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the concentration of Ca\u00b2+.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nKf = [CaY\u00b2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.\n\nAssuming [CaY\u00b2-] \u2248 0.02 M because x is very small.\n\nSo [Ca\u00b2+] = [Y^4-] = x.\n\nSo 0.02/(x^2) =5e10 \u2192 x^2 =0.02/(5e10) \u2192 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5)e-12 \u2192 0.4e-12 \u21924e-13.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25\u00b0C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (K) tells us how strong that complex is. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is quite stable because K is 5e10, which is a large number.\n\nThe problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 0.02 M. I think this is the concentration of the complex after it's formed, so the solution is at equilibrium. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution.\n\nWait, the formula for the formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so I think the complex is usually written as Ca-EDTA^2- or something like that. Oh, right, the formula for the complex is CaY\u00b2\u2212 where Y is the EDTA^4\u2212. So the formation constant equation is K = [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]).\n\nBut wait, the problem says it's a 1:1 complex, so stoichiometric. So the reaction is Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212.\n\nWait, but in solution, the EDTA is usually in various protonated forms because EDTA is a polyprotic acid. But the question says the pH is ideal, which I think means that we can assume that the EDTA is fully deprotonated, so Y^4- is dominant. So I don't have to worry about the different protonation states of EDTA here. That simplifies things.\n\nSo the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote that as [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M.\n\nBut wait, the total EDTA in solution would be the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA bound to calcium. But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So I'm assuming that the initial concentration is that. So, perhaps the total concentration of EDTA is 0.02 M? Or is there more to it?\n\nWait, no. Because when the complex forms, the EDTA is consumed. So, if the initial solution is made by adding 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, then the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But if EDTA and Ca\u00b2+ were added separately, then the total would be different. But in this case, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex, so I think that the initial concentration of CaY\u00b2\u2212 is 0.02 M.\n\nSo, for the purposes of this problem, I think I can model it as follows. Let me write the dissociation of the complex:\n\nCaY\u00b2\u2212 \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212\n\nThe formation constant K is given, which is 5e10. Wait, no, wait. Formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the formation reaction is Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212 \u2192 CaY\u00b2\u2212, and K is 5e10. So the dissociation would have an equilibrium constant which is 1/K, so 2e-11.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formation constant K is [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]). So if I have the dissociation, the K for that reaction would be 1/Kformation = 2e-11.\n\nSo, when the complex dissociates, it produces Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212. Let me denote the change as x. So, if the complex dissociates, the concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212 will each be x.\n\nWait, but initially, before dissociation, the concentration of CaY\u00b2\u2212 is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212 are zero. But that's not possible because that would mean no dissociation. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the solution has only the complex present. So, when the complex dissociates, it will produce some Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212. Let me think in terms of equilibrium.\n\nSo, let me let the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ at equilibrium be x. Then, since the complex dissociates into one Ca\u00b2+ and one Y^4\u2212, the concentration of Y^4\u2212 is also x. The concentration of the complex, [CaY\u00b2\u2212], is 0.02 - x. But wait, if x is very small compared to 0.02, then 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02. Since K is very large (5e10), the complex is very stable, so x would be very small. So, 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo, the equilibrium expression is K = [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02 / x\u00b2.\n\nWait, but K is 5e10. So,\n\n5e10 = 0.02 / x\u00b2\n\nSo, solving for x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 4e-13? Wait, wait, let's calculate 0.02 divided by 5e10.\n\nWait, 0.02 is 2e-2.\n\nSo 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5 (since (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13). So x = 2e-6.5. Let me calculate 1e-6.5. 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-6.5 is approx 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.\n\nSo x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. That would be the concentration of Ca\u00b2+.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. I assumed that x is small compared to 0.02, so [CaY\u00b2\u2212] \u2248 0.02. If x is 6.3e-7, then 0.02 is 2e-2, which is 2e-2 / 6.3e-7 \u2248 3e4, which is way larger than 1, so x is indeed negligible compared to 0.02. So the approximation holds.\n\nSo the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25\u00b0C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (K) tells us how strong that complex is. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is quite stable because K is 5e10, which is a large number.\n\nThe problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 0.02 M. I think this is the concentration of the complex after it's formed, so the solution is at equilibrium. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution.\n\nWait, the formula for the formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so I think the complex is usually written as Ca-EDTA^2- or something like that. Oh, right, the formula for the complex is CaY\u00b2\u2212 where Y is the EDTA^4\u2212. So the formation constant equation is K = [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]).\n\nBut wait, the problem says it's a 1:1 complex, so stoichiometric. So the reaction is Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212.\n\nWait, but in solution, the EDTA is usually in various protonated forms because EDTA is a polyprotic acid. But the question says the pH is ideal, which I think means that we can assume that the EDTA is fully deprotonated, so Y^4- is dominant. So I don't have to worry about the different protonation states of EDTA here. That simplifies things.\n\nSo the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote that as [CaY\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M.\n\nBut wait, the total EDTA in solution would be the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA bound to calcium. But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So I'm assuming that the initial concentration is that. So, perhaps the total concentration of EDTA is 0.02 M? Or is there more to it?\n\nWait, no. Because when the complex forms, the EDTA is consumed. So, if the initial solution is made by adding 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, then the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But if EDTA and Ca\u00b2+ were added separately, then the total would be different. But in this case, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex, so I think that the initial concentration of CaY\u00b2\u2212 is 0.02 M.\n\nSo, for the purposes of this problem, I think I can model it as follows. Let me write the dissociation of the complex:\n\nCaY\u00b2\u2212 \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212\n\nThe formation constant K is given, which is 5e10. Wait, no, wait. Formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the formation reaction is Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212 \u2192 CaY\u00b2\u2212, and K is 5e10. So the dissociation would have an equilibrium constant which is 1/K, so 2e-11.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formation constant K is [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]). So if I have the dissociation, the K for that reaction would be 1/Kformation = 2e-11.\n\nSo, when the complex dissociates, it produces Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212. Let me denote the change as x. So, if the complex dissociates, the concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212 will each be x.\n\nWait, but initially, before dissociation, the concentration of CaY\u00b2\u2212 is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212 are zero. But that's not possible because that would mean no dissociation. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the solution has only the complex present. So, when the complex dissociates, it will produce some Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4\u2212. Let me think in terms of equilibrium.\n\nSo, let me let the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ at equilibrium be x. Then, since the complex dissociates into one Ca\u00b2+ and one Y^4\u2212, the concentration of Y^4\u2212 is also x. The concentration of the complex, [CaY\u00b2\u2212], is 0.02 - x. But wait, if x is very small compared to 0.02, then 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02. Since K is very large (5e10), the complex is very stable, so x would be very small. So, 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo, the equilibrium expression is K = [CaY\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02 / x\u00b2.\n\nWait, but K is 5e10. So,\n\n5e10 = 0.02 / x\u00b2\n\nSo, solving for x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 4e-13? Wait, wait, let's calculate 0.02 divided by 5e10.\n\nWait, 0.02 is 2e-2.\n\nSo 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5 (since (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13). So x = 2e-6.5. Let me calculate 1e-6.5. 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-6.5 is approx 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.\n\nSo x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. That would be the concentration of Ca\u00b2+.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. I assumed that x is small compared to 0.02, so [CaY\u00b2\u2212] \u2248 0.02. If x is 6.3e-7, then 0.02 is 2e-2, which is 2e-2 / 6.3e-7 \u2248 3e4, which is way larger than 1, so x is indeed negligible compared to 0.02.

The options are A to D, and I need to find which one is the correct concentration of calcium ions.\n\nWait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So the Ca-EDTA complex is probably CaY^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.\n\nThe formula for the formation constant is Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

I think the question states it's the concentration of the solution containing 0.02 M of the stoichiometric complex, so I guess that's the equilibrium concentration of the complex.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex\". So maybe that's the initial concentration before any dissociation happens. Or perhaps it's the concentration of the complex in solution, assuming it's fully formed, but that seems unlikely because K is large, so the complex is stable. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, let's think about the equilibrium. The complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nSo, the reaction is: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA^2- (the complex). The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, so the complex is very stable. That means that the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is much higher than the concentrations of the free ions, Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nBut in this problem, the solution has 0.02 M of the complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are zero? Or wait, no, perhaps the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA salt. For example, if you have a salt like Ca-EDTA (like calcium disodium EDTA, which is CaNa2EDTA), then dissolving it would give you the complex ion in solution. But in solution, the complex can dissociate a bit.\n\nWait, but in this case, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric complex. So I think that [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But since Kf is so large, the dissociation would be minimal. So the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- would be very low.\n\nWait, but wait: The formation constant equation is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). So if [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and Kf is 5e10, then [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] = [CaEDTA^2-]/Kf.\n\nSo [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] = (0.02) / (5e10) = 4e-13.\n\nBut wait, in the solution, the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. So the total EDTA concentration is the sum of [EDTA^4-] and [CaEDTA^2-]. Wait, but if the complex is very stable, [EDTA^4-] is very small, so the total EDTA is approximately 0.02 M. But in reality, the EDTA is from the dissociation of the complex. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the dissociation of the complex. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ ions that dissociate from the complex. Then, each mole of complex that dissociates produces one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So:\n\n[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since x is very small due to the large Kf).\n\n[Ca^2+] = x.\n\n[EDTA^4-] = x.\n\nSo, the product [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] = x * x = x^2.\n\nAnd Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/(x^2) = 5e10.\n\nSo, 5e10 = 0.02 / x^2 \u2192 x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 / 10 \u2192 Wait, let me calculate this properly.\n\nWait, 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.\n\nWait, wait, wait: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) )= (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13.\n\nWait, let me compute 0.02 / 5e10.\n\n0.02 = 2e-2.\n\n5e10 = 5 x10^10.\n\nSo 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13.\n\nSo x^2 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5.\n\nWait, 1e-13 is 1e-6.5 squared? Let me think: 1e-6 is (1e-3)^2 = 1e-6. So 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 \u2248 6.32e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's 6.32e-7 M, which is option C (6.3e-7 M). So the concentration of Ca^2+ is x, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Are we assuming that [EDTA^4-] is equal to x? Because in reality, the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex, but if the solution is such that the EDTA is present as the complex, then the total EDTA is 0.02 M. So when the complex dissociates, the EDTA comes from that. Hmm, but if the complex is 0.02 M and it dissociates a little, the [EDTA^4-] would be x, and [CaEDTA^2-] would be 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo that part should be okay. So the product [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] is x^2 = 4e-13, so x is 2e-6.5, which is about 6.3e-7. So option C is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the math correctly. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).\n\nWe have [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.\n\n[Ca^2+] = [EDTA^4-] = x.\n\nSo Kf = 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10.\n\nSo x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) )= 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = approximately 6.32e-7 M.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the correct answer is option C: 6.3e-7 M.\n",

So:\n\n[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since x is very small due to the large Kf).\n\n[Ca^2+] = x.\n\n[EDTA^4-] = x.\n\nSo, the product [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] = x * x = x^2.\n\nAnd Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/(x^2) = 5e10.\n\nSo, 5e10 = 0.02 / x^2 \u2192 x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 / 10 \u2192 Wait, let me calculate this properly.\n\nWait, 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.\n\nWait, wait, wait: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) )= (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13.\n\nWait, let me compute 0.02 / 5e10.\n\n0.02 = 2e-2.\n\n5e10 = 5 x10^10.\n\nSo 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13.\n\nSo x^2 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5.\n\nWait, 1e-13 is 1e-6.5 squared? Let me think: 1e-6 is (1e-3)^2 = 1e-6. So 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 \u2248 6.32e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's 6.32e-7 M, which is option C (6.3e-7 M). So the concentration of Ca^2+ is x, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Are we assuming that [EDTA^4-] is equal to x? Because in reality, the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex, but if the solution is such that the EDTA is present as the complex, then the total EDTA is 0.02 M. So when the complex dissociates, the EDTA comes from that. Hmm, but if the complex is 0.02 M and it dissociates a little, the [EDTA^4-] would be x, and [CaEDTA^2-] would be 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo that part should be okay. So the product [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] is x^2 = 4e-13, so x is 2e-6.5, which is about 6.3e-7. So option C is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the math correctly. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).\n\nWe have [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.\n\n[Ca^2+] = [EDTA^4-] = x.\n\nSo Kf = 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10.\n\nSo x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) )= 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = approximately 6.32e-7 M.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the correct answer is option C: 6.3e-7 M.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca\u00b2\u207a]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant equation:\n\n\\[\nK_f = \\frac{[\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10} \\), and the equilibrium concentration of the complex \\([\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \\, \\text{M}\\). Let \\( x \\) represent the concentration of dissociated \\([\\text{Ca}^{2+}]\\) and \\([\\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\\). Since the complex is very stable (\\( K_f \\) is large), the dissociation is minimal, so \\([\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \\approx 0.02 \\, \\text{M}\\).\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n\\[\nK_f = \\frac{0.02}{x^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{0.02}{K_f} = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M}\n\\]\n\nThus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \\( 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M} \\), which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium.\n\nThe given data: the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, and the pH is ideal. I think that probably means that the pH is such that the EDTA is in its correct form, maybe deprotonated enough to bind the metal.\n\nWait, I should probably start by recalling the formation constant. The formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. For the reaction: Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA^2-. So Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]).\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the concentration given is of the complex itself. So the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-.\n\nWe need to find the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ ions in solution. Because EDTA is a strong chelating agent, the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ should be really low. That's because the complex is stable, so most of the Ca\u00b2+ is tied up in the complex.\n\nLet me think about the expression again. Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]).\n\nBut wait, in this case, the solution is prepared with the Ca-EDTA complex, so initially, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But because the complex can dissociate a little, we have to find the [Ca\u00b2+] and [EDTA^4-] at equilibrium.\n\nAssuming that the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ is 'x', then the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be 'x' because for every mole of Ca\u00b2+ released, one mole of EDTA^4- is released. So [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA^4-] = x.\n\nSo substituting into the Kf expression: Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x\u00b2.\n\nWe know Kf is 5e10, so:\n\n5e10 = 0.02 / x\u00b2 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 0.02 / 5e10.\n\nLet me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/(5e12)) \u2192 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13 \u2192 x is sqrt(4e-13) \u2192 which is 2e-6.5, but wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13, so the square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the math. Let me write the steps more clearly.\n\nKf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-] )\n\nAssuming that the complex dissociates a little, so:\n\n[Ca\u00b2+] = x\n[EDTA^4-] = x\n[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since x is very small compared to 0.02)\n\nSo, Kf \u2248 (0.02) / (x^2) = 5e10.\n\nSo x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) \u2192 0.02 is 2e-2.\n\n2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 \u2192 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13.\n\nx = sqrt(4e-13) \u2192 2e-6.5.\n\nWait, 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M. So that's about 6.3e-7, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, what if I made a mistake in assuming that [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately 0.02? Let's think. If Kf is 5e10, which is a very large number, the complex is very stable, so x is very small compared to 0.02. So the approximation holds.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C: 6.3e-7 M.\n",
