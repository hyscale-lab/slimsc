      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (\u03b2) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ or maybe the tetrathiocyanato? Wait, wait, no, the blue one is probably the one with two SCN- ligands. Or is it four? I remember that the color changes with the number of ligands. Oh wait, the dithiocyanato would be two SCN- per Co^2+. But I'm not 100% sure, but I'll proceed.\n\nThe stability constants are given as \u03b21 to \u03b24. Stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands because more ligands make the complex more stable. So \u03b24 is 16, which is lower than \u03b23 (63) and \u03b22 (40). Hmm, that's interesting. So the most stable complex is the one with three SCN- ligands (\u03b23=63), followed by \u03b22=40, then \u03b21=9, and \u03b24=16 is lower than \u03b23 but higher than \u03b21. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, no, wait, \u03b24 is the stability constant for the four-coordinate complex. So the ordering is \u03b23 > \u03b22 > \u03b24 > \u03b21. Wait, no, wait: \u03b21 is 9, \u03b22 is 40, \u03b23 is 63, \u03b24 is 16. So \u03b23 is the largest, then \u03b22, then \u03b24, then \u03b21. Hmm, so the order of stability is Co(SCN)_3^+, Co(SCN)_2^2+, Co(SCN)_4^2-, and then Co(SCN)_1^+? I'm not sure about the charges. Wait, let me think: each SCN- is -1, so Co^2+ with n SCN- would have a charge of 2 - n. So Co(SCN)_1^+ would be Co^2+ + SCN^- \u2192 charge +1? Wait, no. Wait, the formula for each complex:\n\n- Co(SCN)_1^+ \u2192 Co^2+ + SCN^- \u2192 charge is 2+ - (1*-1) = 1+? So the complex would have charge +1.\n\n- Co(SCN)_2^2+ \u2192 Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- \u2192 charge is 2+ - 2*(-1) = 2+ +2 = 4+? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait: Co is 2+; each SCN is -1. So the total charge of the complex is 2+ + (n * (-1)). So for n=1: 2+ -1 = +1. For n=2: 2+ -2 = 0? So neutral? Hmm, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n). Because each SCN is -1, and Co is +2. So for each SCN added, the charge decreases by 1. So for n=1: [CoSCN]^+, n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0, n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- , n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.\n\nWait, but the problem refers to the \"dithiocyanato\" complex, which I think is the one with two SCN- per Co^2+. So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is a neutral complex.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact complexes, but perhaps I can proceed with the general approach.\n\nThe problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. So let's assume that the blue one is the one with two SCN- ligands, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex. So we're looking for the fraction of Co that is in that particular complex.\n\nTo find the distribution of the different complexes, we can use the stability constants (\u03b2) and the concentrations of the ions. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex based on their stability and the concentrations of the ions.\n\nThe overall idea is that each complex is in equilibrium with the others, and the fraction of each complex depends on the product of the stability constant and the concentrations of the free ions raised to the appropriate power.\n\nThe formula for the fraction of a particular complex is given by:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n * [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} \u03b2_k [SCN^-]^k )\n\nWait, but wait. The general expression is that the fraction of the nth complex is (\u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n) divided by the sum of all \u03b2_k [SCN^-]^k plus 1 (for the case where no ligands are bound, but wait, the Co^2+ itself has zero ligands, so the term for zero is 1, but here the problem starts with \u03b21 for n=1, so perhaps the sum is from k=0 to 4, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the stability constants given are for the complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 SCN- ligands. So the total includes all possible complexes plus the free Co^2+.\n\nWait, no, the free Co^2+ is the case where n=0, but in the problem, the \u03b2's start from n=1. So the denominator should include all possible complexes, including the free Co^2+. Wait, no, because the stability constants are for the complexes starting from n=1. So the free ion (n=0) is just [Co^2+], and the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} for n=1 to 4. So the total concentration of all species is [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.\n\nBut the total concentration of Co is given as 1e-2 M. So the sum of all species equals 0.01 M.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model the fraction of each species using the stability constants and the ligand concentration.\n\nThe fraction of the nth complex is (\u03b2_n [SCN]^n) divided by the sum over all k (including k=0) of \u03b2_k [SCN]^k, but I'm not sure if \u03b2_0 is 1, which is the case when n=0 (free Co^2+). Because \u03b2 is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions.\n\nWait, the formation constant (\u03b2) for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is defined as:\n\n\u03b2_n = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )\n\nSo, for each complex, the concentration is \u03b2_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.\n\nBut since the total Co is the sum of all species:\n\n[Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = c_total = 0.01 M.\n\nBut maybe instead, I can express each [Co(SCN)_n] in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to assume that the free [Co^2+] is x, and then each complex's concentration is \u03b2_n x [SCN^-]^n.\n\nWait, that's a common approach. Let me think: Let [Co^2+] = x. Then, [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = \u03b2_n x [SCN^-]^n.\n\nSo the total concentration is x + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n x [SCN^-]^n = c_total = 0.01 M.\n\nSo x (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n ) = 0.01.\n\nSo x = 0.01 / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n ).\n\nOnce we have x, the concentration of each complex is \u03b2_n x [SCN^-]^n.\n\nSo the fraction of each complex is (\u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n ).\n\nWait, but wait: because the denominator is sum_{n=0}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n, where \u03b2_0 is 1 (since for n=0, the complex is Co^2+ and \u03b2_0 = [Co^2+]/( [Co^2+][SCN]^0 ) = 1/(1) = 1? Wait, no, that's not correct. For n=0, the complex is just Co^2+, so the formation constant \u03b2_0 would be 1, because [Co^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN]^0) = 1/([Co^2+][1]) ) \u2192 Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nThe formation constant \u03b2_n is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:\n\nCo^2+ + n SCN^- \u2194 [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.\n\nSo \u03b2_n = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )\n\nSo, for each n, the concentration of the complex is \u03b2_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.\n\nSo the total concentration of Co is [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.\n\nThis can be factored as [Co^2+] (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n ) = c_total.\n\nSo [Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n )\n\nOnce [Co^2+] is known, each [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is \u03b2_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.\n\nTherefore, the fraction f_n of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} / c_total = (\u03b2_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n) / c_total.\n\nSubstituting [Co^2+] from earlier:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n * (c_total / denominator) * [SCN^-]^n ) / c_total\n\nThe c_total cancels out, so:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n ) / denominator, where denominator is (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n )\n\nSo the denominator is sum_{n=0}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n, where \u03b2_0 = 1, since for n=0, \u03b2_0 = 1.\n\nWait, no, because in our case, the sum starts from n=1, but \u03b2_0 is 1, so the denominator is 1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n.\n\nSo, for each n, f_n = (\u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n )\n\nSo in our problem, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and the \u03b2 values are given.\n\nBut wait, the \u03b24 is 16. So let's compute each term \u03b2_n [SCN]^n.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nn=1: \u03b21 =9, [SCN]=0.1 \u2192 9*(0.1)^1 = 0.9\n\nn=2: \u03b22=40, (0.1)^2=0.01 \u2192 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nn=3: \u03b23=63, (0.1)^3=0.001 \u2192 63 *0.001 = 0.063\n\nn=4: \u03b24=16, (0.1)^4=0.0001 \u219216 * 0.0001=0.0016\n\nSo the sum of these terms is 0.9 + 0.4 = 1.3; 1.3 + 0.063 = 1.363; 1.363 + 0.0016 = 1.3646.\n\nPlus the 1 from \u03b20: denominator is 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.\n\nWait, no: wait, denominator is 1 + sum of the four terms. So sum of four terms is 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646. Adding 1 gives denominator 2.3646.\n\nSo the denominator is 2.3646.\n\nNow, for each n, the fraction f_n is (\u03b2_n [SCN]^n ) / 2.3646.\n\nSo:\n\nFor n=1: 0.9 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.3807 \u2192 38.07%\n\nn=2: 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.169 \u219216.9%\n\nn=3: 0.063 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.0266 \u21922.66%\n\nn=4: 0.0016 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.000676 \u21920.0676%\n\nWait, but the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So the fraction is approximately 16.9% \u2192 looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.\n\nWait, but wait! That can't be right because the options also have 38%, which is the n=1 fraction.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I thought dithiocyanato refers to n=2, but maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the blue color corresponds to another complex.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about the complexes and their colors. Cobalt complexes with different numbers of thiocyanate ligands have different colors. The [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is usually blue, while [Co(SCN)_3]^- is green, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is brown. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the blue is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Wait, earlier I was getting confused about the charges.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^+? Or maybe [Co(SCN)_2] is the neutral complex. Hmm.\n\nWait, in any case, according to the calculation, the fraction for n=2 is 16.9%, which is option D. But wait, in the options, option C is 38.1%, which is the n=1 fraction.\n\nBut the problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the dithiocyanato is n=2, then the answer is D. But if the blue is a different n, like n=3, then perhaps the answer would be 2.66%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, let's compute the denominator again.\n\nEach term:\n\nn=1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2:40 * 0.01=0.4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3:63 * 0.001=0.063 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4:16 * 0.0001=0.0016 \u2192 correct.\n\nSum of these four terms: 0.9+0.4=1.3; 1.3+0.063=1.363; 1.363+0.0016=1.3646.\n\nDenominator is 1 + 1.3646=2.3646 \u2192 correct.\n\nNow, the fraction for n=2 (dithiocyanato, assuming n=2) is 0.4 / 2.3646 = approximately 0.169, so 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nBut the options include C as 38.1%, which is the n=1 fraction. So if the question refers to the dithiocyanato as n=2, the answer is D. But perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the dithiocyanato is n=2.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused about the nomenclature. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- groups, so n=2. So the answer should be 16.9%, option D.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the options are:\n\nA) 42.3%\n\nB)25.6%\n\nC)38.1%\n\nD)16.9%\n\nHmm, but wait a second. Let me think again about the complexes.\n\nThe problem says the stability constants are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So for each n=1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nBut perhaps the numbering is different. Maybe \u03b21 is the complex with n=1, \u03b22 is n=2, etc. So in that case, for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), \u03b2 is 40.\n\nSo in the denominator, the sum is 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646, plus 1 \u2192 2.3646.\n\nSo f2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.169, so 16.9% \u2192 option D.\n\nBut let me think again: perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which would be the n=2 case, which would have \u03b22=40. So the calculation should be correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which is the fraction for n=1. So that would be the monothiocyanato complex. So why is the question asking for the dithiocyanato, which is n=2, and that's 16.9%, option D.\n\nSo the answer should be D, 16.9%.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me recalculate the denominator.\n\nDenominator = 1 + (\u03b21[SCN]^1 + \u03b22[SCN]^2 + \u03b23[SCN]^3 + \u03b24[SCN]^4 )\n\nWhich is 1 + (9*(0.1) + 40*(0.01) +63*(0.001) +16*(0.0001) )\n\nSo 9*(0.1)=0.9\n\n40*(0.01)=0.4\n\n63*(0.001)=0.063\n\n16*(0.0001)=0.0016\n\nSum these: 0.9 + 0.4 =1.3; 1.3 +0.063=1.363; 1.363+0.0016=1.3646.\n\nSo denominator is 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo f2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2192 let me compute that.\n\n0.4 divided by 2.3646.\n\nWell, 2.3646 \u00d7 0.169 is approximately 0.4.\n\nBecause 2.3646 \u00d7 0.169 \u2192 2.3646 * 0.1 = 0.23646; 2.3646 * 0.06 = 0.141876; 2.3646 * 0.009 = 0.0212814. Adding those together: 0.23646 + 0.141876 = 0.378336 + 0.0212814 = 0.3996174 \u2192 approximately 0.4. So 0.169 is correct.\n\nSo 16.9% is option D.\n\nBut wait, the options also include C) 38.1%, which is the fraction for n=1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I mixed up n=1 and n=2. Let me check what each n corresponds to.\n\nn=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ \u2192 this is a +1 charge complex.\n\nn=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 \u2192 neutral.\n\nn=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- \u2192 -1 charge.\n\nn=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- \u2192 -2 charge.\n\nSo the blue color is for the dithiocyanato, which is n=2, so the fraction is 16.9% \u2192 option D.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (\u03b2) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ or maybe the tetrathiocyanato? Wait, wait, no, the blue one is probably the one with two SCN- ligands. Or is it four? I remember that the color changes with the number of ligands. Oh wait, the dithiocyanato would be two SCN- per Co^2+. But I'm not 100% sure, but I'll proceed.\n\nThe stability constants are given as \u03b21 to \u03b24. Stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands because more ligands make the complex more stable. So \u03b24 is 16, which is lower than \u03b23 (63) and \u03b22 (40). Hmm, that's interesting. So the most stable complex is the one with three SCN- ligands (\u03b23=63), followed by \u03b22=40, then \u03b21=9, and \u03b24=16 is lower than \u03b23 but higher than \u03b21. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, no, wait, \u03b24 is the stability constant for the four-coordinate complex. So the ordering is \u03b23 > \u03b22 > \u03b24 > \u03b21. Wait, no, wait: \u03b21 is 9, \u03b22 is 40, \u03b23 is 63, \u03b24 is 16. So \u03b23 is the largest, then \u03b22, then \u03b24, then \u03b21. Hmm, so the order of stability is Co(SCN)_3^+, Co(SCN)_2^2+, Co(SCN)_4^2-, and then Co(SCN)_1^+? I'm not sure about the charges. Wait, let me think: each SCN- is -1, so Co^2+ with n SCN- would have a charge of 2 - n. So Co(SCN)_1^+ would be Co^2+ + SCN^- \u2192 charge +1? Wait, no. Wait, the formula for each complex:\n\n- Co(SCN)_1^+ \u2192 Co^2+ + SCN^- \u2192 charge is 2+ - (1*-1) = 1+? So the complex would have charge +1.\n\n- Co(SCN)_2^2+ \u2192 Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- \u2192 charge is 2+ - 2*(-1) = 2+ +2 = 4+? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait: Co is 2+; each SCN is -1. So the total charge of the complex is 2+ + (n * (-1)). So for n=1: 2+ -1 = +1. For n=2: 2+ -2 = 0? So neutral? Hmm, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n). Because each SCN is -1, and Co is +2. So for each SCN added, the charge decreases by 1. So for n=1: [CoSCN]^+, n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0, n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- , n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.\n\nWait, but the problem refers to the \"dithiocyanato\" complex, which I think is the one with two SCN- per Co^2+. So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is a neutral complex.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact complexes, but perhaps I can proceed with the general approach.\n\nThe problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. So let's assume that the blue one is the one with two SCN- ligands, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex. So we're looking for the fraction of Co that is in that particular complex.\n\nTo find the distribution of the different complexes, we can use the stability constants (\u03b2) and the concentrations of the ions. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex based on their stability and the concentrations of the ions.\n\nThe overall idea is that each complex is in equilibrium with the others, and the fraction of each complex depends on the product of the stability constant and the concentrations of the free ions raised to the appropriate power.\n\nThe formula for the fraction of a particular complex is given by:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n * [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} \u03b2_k [SCN^-]^k )\n\nWait, but wait. The general expression is that the fraction of the nth complex is (\u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n) divided by the sum of all \u03b2_k [SCN^-]^k plus 1 (for the case where no ligands are bound, but wait, the Co^2+ itself has zero ligands, so the term for zero is 1, but here the problem starts with \u03b21 for n=1, so perhaps the sum is from k=0 to 4, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the stability constants given are for the complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 SCN- ligands. So the total includes all possible complexes plus the free Co^2+.\n\nWait, no, the free Co^2+ is the case where n=0, but in the problem, the \u03b2's start from n=1. So the denominator should include all possible complexes, including the free Co^2+. Wait, no, because the stability constants are for the complexes starting from n=1. So the free ion (n=0) is just [Co^2+], and the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} for n=1 to 4. So the total concentration of all species is [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.\n\nBut the total concentration of Co is given as 1e-2 M. So the sum of all species equals 0.01 M.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model the fraction of each species using the stability constants and the ligand concentration.\n\nThe fraction of the nth complex is (\u03b2_n [SCN]^n) divided by the sum over all k (including k=0) of \u03b2_k [SCN]^k, but I'm not sure if \u03b2_0 is 1, which is the case when n=0 (free Co^2+). Because \u03b2 is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions.\n\nWait, the formation constant (\u03b2) for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is defined as:\n\n\u03b2_n = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )\n\nSo, for each complex, the concentration is \u03b2_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.\n\nBut since the total Co is the sum of all species:\n\n[Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = c_total = 0.01 M.\n\nBut maybe instead, I can express each [Co(SCN)_n] in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to assume that the free [Co^2+] is x, and then each complex's concentration is \u03b2_n x [SCN^-]^n.\n\nWait, that's a common approach. Let me think: Let [Co^2+] = x. Then, [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = \u03b2_n x [SCN^-]^n.\n\nSo the total concentration is x + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n x [SCN^-]^n = c_total = 0.01 M.\n\nSo x (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n ) = 0.01.\n\nSo x = 0.01 / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n ).\n\nOnce we have x, the concentration of each complex is \u03b2_n x [SCN^-]^n.\n\nSo the fraction of each complex is (\u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n ).\n\nWait, but wait: because the denominator is sum_{n=0}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n, where \u03b2_0 is 1 (since for n=0, the complex is Co^2+ and \u03b2_0 = [Co^2+]/( [Co^2+][SCN]^0 ) = 1/(1) = 1? Wait, no, that's not correct. For n=0, the complex is just Co^2+, so the formation constant \u03b2_0 would be 1, because [Co^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN]^0) = 1/([Co^2+][1]) ) \u2192 Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nThe formation constant \u03b2_n is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:\n\nCo^2+ + n SCN^- \u2194 [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.\n\nSo \u03b2_n = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )\n\nSo, for each n, the concentration of the complex is \u03b2_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.\n\nSo the total concentration of Co is [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.\n\nThis can be factored as [Co^2+] (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n ) = c_total.\n\nSo [Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n )\n\nOnce [Co^2+] is known, each [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is \u03b2_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.\n\nTherefore, the fraction f_n of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} / c_total = (\u03b2_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n) / c_total.\n\nSubstituting [Co^2+] from earlier:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n * (c_total / denominator) * [SCN^-]^n ) / c_total\n\nThe c_total cancels out, so:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n ) / denominator, where denominator is (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n )\n\nSo the denominator is sum_{n=0}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n, where \u03b2_0 = 1, since for n=0, \u03b2_0 = 1.\n\nWait, no, because in our case, the sum starts from n=1, but \u03b2_0 is 1, so the denominator is 1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n.\n\nSo, for each n, f_n = (\u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 \u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n )\n\nSo in our problem, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and the \u03b2 values are given.\n\nBut wait, the \u03b24 is 16. So let's compute each term \u03b2_n [SCN]^n.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nn=1: \u03b21 =9, [SCN]=0.1 \u2192 9*(0.1)^1 = 0.9\n\nn=2: \u03b22=40, (0.1)^2=0.01 \u2192 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nn=3: \u03b23=63, (0.1)^3=0.001 \u2192 63 *0.001 = 0.063\n\nn=4: \u03b24=16, (0.1)^4=0.0001 \u219216 * 0.0001=0.0016\n\nSo the sum of these terms is 0.9 + 0.4 = 1.3; 1.3 + 0.063 = 1.363; 1.363 + 0.0016 = 1.3646.\n\nPlus the 1 from \u03b20: denominator is 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.\n\nWait, no: wait, denominator is 1 + sum of the four terms. So sum of four terms is 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646. Adding 1 gives denominator 2.3646.\n\nSo the denominator is 2.3646.\n\nNow, for each n, the fraction f_n is (\u03b2_n [SCN]^n ) / 2.3646.\n\nSo:\n\nFor n=1: 0.9 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.3807 \u2192 38.07%\n\nn=2: 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.169 \u219216.9%\n\nn=3: 0.063 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.0266 \u21922.66%\n\nn=4: 0.0016 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.000676 \u21920.0676%\n\nWait, but the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So the fraction is approximately 16.9% \u2192 looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.\n\nWait, but wait! That can't be right because the options also have 38%, which is the n=1 fraction.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I thought dithiocyanato refers to n=2, but maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the blue color corresponds to another complex.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about the complexes and their colors. Cobalt complexes with different numbers of thiocyanate ligands have different colors. The [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is usually blue, while [Co(SCN)_3]^- is green, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is brown. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the blue is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Wait, earlier I was getting confused about the charges.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^+? Or maybe [Co(SCN)_2] is the neutral complex. Hmm.\n\nWait, in any case, according to the calculation, the fraction for n=2 is 16.9%, which is option D. But wait, in the options, option C is 38.1%, which is the n=1 fraction.\n\nBut the problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the dithiocyanato is n=2, then the answer is D. But if the blue is a different n, like n=3, then perhaps the answer would be 2.66%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, let's compute the denominator again.\n\nEach term:\n\nn=1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2:40 * 0.01=0.4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3:63 * 0.001=0.063 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4:16 * 0.0001=0.0016 \u2192 correct.\n\nSum of these four terms: 0.9+0.4=1.3; 1.3+0.063=1.363; 1.363+0.0016=1.3646.\n\nDenominator is 1 + 1.3646=2.3646 \u2192 correct.\n\nNow, the fraction for n=2 (dithiocyanato, assuming n=2) is 0.4 / 2.3646 = approximately 0.169, so 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nBut the options include C as 38.1%, which is the n=1 fraction. So if the question refers to the dithiocyanato as n=2, the answer is D. But perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the dithiocyanato is n=2.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused about the nomenclature. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- groups, so n=2. So the answer should be 16.9%, option D.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the options are:\n\nA) 42.3%\n\nB)25.6%\n\nC)38.1%\n\nD)16.9%\n\nHmm, but wait a second. Let me think again about the complexes.\n\nThe problem says the stability constants are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So for each n=1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nBut perhaps the numbering is different. Maybe \u03b21 is the complex with n=1, \u03b22 is n=2, etc. So in that case, for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), \u03b2 is 40.\n\nSo in the denominator, the sum is 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646, plus 1 \u2192 2.3646.\n\nSo f2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.169, so 16.9% \u2192 option D.\n\nBut let me think again: perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which would be the n=2 case, which would have \u03b22=40. So the calculation should be correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which is the fraction for n=1. So that would be the monothiocyanato complex. So why is the question asking for the dithiocyanato, which is n=2, and that's 16.9%, option D.\n\nSo the answer should be D, 16.9%.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me recalculate the denominator.\n\nDenominator = 1 + (\u03b21[SCN]^1 + \u03b22[SCN]^2 + \u03b23[SCN]^3 + \u03b24[SCN]^4 )\n\nWhich is 1 + (9*(0.1) + 40*(0.01) +63*(0.001) +16*(0.0001) )\n\nSo 9*(0.1)=0.9\n\n40*(0.01)=0.4\n\n63*(0.001)=0.063\n\n16*(0.0001)=0.0016\n\nSum these: 0.9 + 0.4 =1.3; 1.3 +0.063=1.363; 1.363+0.0016=1.3646.\n\nSo denominator is 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo f2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2192 let me compute that.\n\n0.4 divided by 2.3646.\n\nWell, 2.3646 \u00d7 0.169 is approximately 0.4.\n\nBecause 2.3646 \u00d7 0.169 \u2192 2.3646 * 0.1 = 0.23646; 2.3646 * 0.06 = 0.141876; 2.3646 * 0.009 = 0.0212814. Adding those together: 0.23646 + 0.141876 = 0.378336 + 0.0212814 = 0.3996174 \u2192 approximately 0.4. So 0.169 is correct.\n\nSo 16.9% is option D.\n\nBut wait, the options also include C) 38.1%, which is the fraction for n=1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I mixed up n=1 and n=2. Let me check what each n corresponds to.\n\nn=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ \u2192 this is a +1 charge complex.\n\nn=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 \u2192 neutral.\n\nn=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- \u2192 -1 charge.\n\nn=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- \u2192 -2 charge.\n\nSo the blue color is for the dithiocyanato, which is n=2, so the fraction is 16.9% \u2192 option D.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are provided as:\n\n- \u03b2\u2081 = 9 (n = 1)\n- \u03b2\u2082 = 40 (n = 2)\n- \u03b2\u2083 = 63 (n = 3)\n- \u03b2\u2084 = 16 (n = 4)\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is 10\u207b\u00b2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The fraction of each complex is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf_n = \\frac{\\beta_n [\\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \\sum_{n=1}^4 \\beta_n [\\text{SCN}^-]^n}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute the terms for each complex\nFor each \\( n \\), calculate \\( \\beta_n [\\text{SCN}^-]^n \\):\n- \\( n = 1 \\): \\( \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \\times 0.1 = 0.9 \\)\n- \\( n = 2 \\): \\( \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \\times 0.01 = 0.4 \\)\n- \\( n = 3 \\): \\( \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \\times 0.001 = 0.063 \\)\n- \\( n = 4 \\): \\( \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \\times 0.0001 = 0.0016 \\)\n\n### Step 2: Compute the denominator\nThe denominator is the sum of all terms, including the free cobalt ion (\\( n = 0 \\), represented by 1):\n\\[\n\\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the fraction for \\( n = 2 \\) (dithiocyanato complex)\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (\\( n = 2 \\)) is:\n\\[\nf_2 = \\frac{\\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{0.4}{2.3646} \\approx 0.169\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Convert to percentage\nThe percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is:\n\\[\nf_2 \\times 100 = 0.169 \\times 100 = 16.9\\%\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Let me think.\n\nAlright, the problem states that the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2 complex, so that's the second one, \u03b22 maybe? Or wait, wait. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, stability constants are for the formation of complexes. For each complex, the beta is the formation constant. So, Co(SCN)_n would have a beta_n. So, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, with \u03b21=9. The second is [Co(SCN)_2], \u03b22=40. Third is [Co(SCN)_3], \u03b23=63. Fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^3-, \u03b24=16.\n\nWait, but wait, the stability constants are in order: beta1 is for the first complex, beta2 for the second, and so on. So, the blue dithiocyanato complex would be the one with two SCN- ions, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^? Hmm, but I'm not sure about the charge. Maybe that doesn't matter right now.\n\nThe question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which are the ones with two SCN- ions. So, I need to find the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ relative to the total cobalt species.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of all possible Co species: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^{3-}.\n\nSo, the total is c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}].\n\nBut I think the problem gives the total cobalt concentration as 1e-2 M, so that's the sum of all these terms.\n\nWait, but the solution also contains 0.1 M SCN-. So, the concentration of free SCN- is 0.1 M. So, the problem involves the distribution of Co(II) into different complexes based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal.\n\nI think the approach here is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex. The fractions depend on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.\n\nWait, the stability constants are given as \u03b21 to \u03b24. The general approach is to model the formation of each complex step by step.\n\nLet me think about how the distribution works. The fraction of each complex can be found by considering the stepwise formation constants. The fractions are given by the ratios of the beta values multiplied by the ligand concentration.\n\nWait, maybe using the formula for each species' concentration. Let's denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, [CoSCN+] = \u03b21 * x * [SCN^-], [Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 * x * [SCN^-]^2, [Co(SCN)_3^-] = \u03b23 * x * [SCN^-]^3, [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] = \u03b24 * x * [SCN^-]^4.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because each step builds on the previous complex. Alternatively, the formation of each complex is cumulative. So, for the nth complex, the concentration is [Co^n] = \u03b21 * \u03b22 * ... * \u03b2n * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me recall: The overall stability constant for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise constants up to that point. Wait, no, the stepwise constants are for each successive addition. So, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of \u03b21 * \u03b22 * ... * \u03b2n. So, for example, [Co(SCN)_2] would have an overall beta of \u03b21 * \u03b22 = 9 *40=360.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the stability constants given are each for the nth complex, so perhaps the \u03b21 is for the first step (from Co^2+ to CoSCN+), \u03b22 is for the second step (CoSCN+ to Co(SCN)_2), etc. So, each \u03b2 is for adding one SCN- to the previous complex.\n\nIf that's the case, then the formation constants for the complexes would be:\n\n\u03b21 = K1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])\n\u03b22 = K2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-])\n\u03b23 = K3 = [Co(SCN)_3^-]/([Co(SCN)_2][SCN^-])\n\u03b24 = K4 = [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}]/([Co(SCN)_3^-][SCN^-])\n\nSo, to find the fraction of each complex, you can consider the distribution based on these stepwise constants and the ligand concentration.\n\nThe fractions can be found by considering the ratios of the successive terms. So, the fraction of Co(SCN)_n is (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2n) [SCN^-]^n divided by the sum over all m of (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2m) [SCN^-]^m.\n\nWait, but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the relative concentrations by considering the ratios of each complex to the next, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fraction of each complex in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration.\n\nLet me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then,\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 * x * [SCN^-]\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 * [CoSCN+] * [SCN^-] = \u03b22 * \u03b21 x [SCN^-]^2\n[Co(SCN)_3^-] = \u03b23 * [Co(SCN)_2] * [SCN^-] = \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 x [SCN^-]^3\n[Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] = \u03b24 * [Co(SCN)_3^-] * [SCN^-] = \u03b24 \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 x [SCN^-]^4\n\nSo, all concentrations can be expressed in terms of x and [SCN^-].\n\nBut the total cobalt is x + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] = c_total = 1e-2 M.\n\nSo, substituting the expressions:\n\nx + \u03b21 [SCN^-] x + \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN^-]^2 x + \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN^-]^3 x + \u03b24 \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN^-]^4 x = 1e-2.\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [1 + \u03b21 [SCN^-] + \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN^-]^2 + \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN^-]^3 + \u03b24 \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN^-]^4 ] = 1e-2.\n\nSo, x is equal to 1e-2 divided by that sum.\n\nWait, but calculating that sum seems a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers.\n\nGiven:\n\n\u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\n[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm 1: 1\n\nTerm 2: \u03b21 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\nTerm3: \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN]^2 = 40 *9 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6\n\nTerm4: \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN]^3 =63 *40 *9 * (0.1)^3 = 63 *40 *9 *0.001.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n63 *40=2520; 2520 *9=22680; 22680 *0.001 = 22.68.\n\nWait, wait, 63*40=2520? No, 60*40=2400, 3*40=120 \u2192 2520. Yes. Then 2520 *9 = 22680? 2500*9=22500, 20*9=180 \u2192 22680. Then times 0.001 \u2192 22.68.\n\nTerm5: \u03b24 \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN]^4 =16 *63 *40 *9 * (0.1)^4.\n\nCompute this:\n\n16 *63 = 1008; 1008 *40=40320; 40320 *9=362,880; times (0.1)^4=0.0001 \u2192 362,880 *0.0001 = 36.288.\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n1 (term1)\n\n0.9 (term2)\n\n3.6 (term3)\n\n22.68 (term4)\n\n36.288 (term5)\n\nAdding them all up: 1 + 0.9 =1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.\n\nSo, the sum is 64.468.\n\nSo, x = (1e-2) / (64.468) = 1e-2 /64.468 \u2248 0.0001551 M.\n\nWait, let me compute 1e-2 is 0.01. 0.01 /64.468 = approx 1.551e-4 M.\n\nNow, the fraction of each complex is [complex]/c_total.\n\nBut wait, the fractions are each [complex]/(sum of all complexes), which is x + [CoSCN+] + ... etc. But since we've already expressed everything in terms of x and [SCN], and x is 0.0001551 M, then the fractions can be computed as each term divided by the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is to compute the fraction of each complex relative to the total.\n\nBecause the fractions are [Co^n]/c_total, where [Co^n] is each complex's concentration.\n\nSo, [Co^2+] = x \u2248 1.551e-4 M.\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 x [SCN] = 9 * x *0.1 = 0.9 x = 0.9 *1.551e-4 = 1.3959e-4.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 * [CoSCN+] * [SCN] = 40 * [CoSCN+] *0.1 =4 * [CoSCN+] =4 *1.3959e-4 =5.5836e-4.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should compute each complex's concentration based on x.\n\nWait, [Co^2+] =x =1.551e-4.\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 x [SCN^-] =9 *1.551e-4 *0.1 = 9 *1.551e-5 = 1.3959e-4.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 [CoSCN+] [SCN] =40 *1.3959e-4 *0.1 =40 *1.3959e-5=5.5836e-4.\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^-] = \u03b23 [Co(SCN)_2] [SCN] =63 *5.5836e-4 *0.1 =63 *5.5836e-5=3.520e-3.\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] = \u03b24 [Co(SCN)_3^-] [SCN] =16 *3.520e-3 *0.1=16 *3.520e-4=5.632e-3.\n\nWait, let me compute each step:\n\n[CoSCN+] = 9 *1.551e-4 *0.1 = 9 * 1.551e-5 = 1.3959e-4.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] =40 * [CoSCN+] *0.1 =40 * 1.3959e-4 *0.1 \u2192 40 *1.3959e-5 =5.5836e-4.\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^-] =63 *5.5836e-4 *0.1 \u219263 *5.5836e-5=3.520e-3.\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{3-}]=16 *3.520e-3 *0.1 \u219216 *3.52e-4=5.632e-3.\n\nNow, let's sum all the concentrations to check if it equals c_total=1e-2.\n\nSum:\n\nx =1.551e-4 \u2192 0.0001551\n\n[CoSCN+] =0.00013959 \u21920.0001396\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] =0.00055836 \u21920.0005584\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^-]=0.00352 \u21920.00352\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{3-}]=0.005632 \u21920.005632\n\nAdding them all:\n\n0.0001551 + 0.0001396 = 0.0002947\n\n+0.0005584 \u2192 0.0008531\n\n+0.00352 \u2192 0.0043731\n\n+0.005632 \u21920.0100051 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.01, which is c_total. So, the calculations seem correct.\n\nNow, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2].\n\nSo, [Co(SCN)_2] =5.5836e-4 M.\n\nTotal c_total=0.01 M.\n\nSo, the fraction is 5.5836e-4 / 0.01 = 0.055836 \u2192 5.5836%.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the options are around 16% up to 42%.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Because 5.5% isn't among the options.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the problem says the stability constants are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So, the stepwise constants are as given.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should consider the overall stability constants, not the stepwise ones. Alternatively, perhaps the way I calculated the concentrations is wrong.\n\nWait, another approach is to use the fractions based on the relative contributions. Because the fractions are given by the ratios of the terms in the sum.\n\nThe sum S is 64.468 as calculated earlier. The terms are:\n\nTerm1:1 \u2192 Co^2+ \u2192 1/64.468 \u22480.01551 \u2192 1.551%\n\nTerm2:0.9 \u2192 [CoSCN+] \u2192 0.9/64.468\u22480.014 \u21921.4%\n\nTerm3:3.6 \u2192 [Co(SCN)_2] \u21923.6/64.468\u22485.57% \u21925.57%\n\nTerm4:22.68 \u2192 [Co(SCN)_3^-] \u219222.68/64.468\u224835.18%\n\nTerm5:36.288 \u2192 [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] \u219236.288/64.468\u224856.28%\n\nSo, adding these percentages:1.55+1.4+5.57+35.18+56.28 =100% approximately.\n\nSo, the percentages are:\n\nCo^2+: ~1.55%\n\nCoSCN+: ~1.4%\n\nCo(SCN)_2: ~5.57%\n\nCo(SCN)_3^-: ~35.18%\n\nCo(SCN)_4^{3-}: ~56.28%\n\nWait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is Co(SCN)_2. So, that's 5.57%. But the options are higher than that. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood which complex is blue. Maybe the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2] or perhaps another one.\n\nWait, I recall that in some cases, the color changes with the number of ligands. For example, [Co(SCN)]^+ is pink, [Co(SCN)_2] is blue, [Co(SCN)_3^-] is green, and [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] is brown. So, the blue is the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2], so that's the third term, 5.57% of the total. But the options don't have that. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the way I computed the fractions. Because when I computed the fractions based on the sum S, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 5.57% of the total.\n\nBut the options don't have that. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps I have a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given for the overall complex, not the stepwise. So, \u03b21 is the overall stability constant for [CoSCN]^+, \u03b22 is for [Co(SCN)_2], etc. So, perhaps the calculation is different.\n\nWait, if that's the case, then the formation constants are for each complex. So, [CoSCN+] = \u03b21 [Co^2+][SCN^-]\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^-] = \u03b23 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] = \u03b24 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_2] would be the product of \u03b21 and \u03b22 in the stepwise model. So, perhaps the given \u03b2's are the overall constants, not stepwise.\n\nWait, the problem says the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So, perhaps each \u03b2 is the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.\n\nSo, for [CoSCN]^+, \u03b21=9 \u2192 [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])=9.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2]: \u03b22=40 \u2192 [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)=40.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn that case, the concentrations would be:\n\n[Co^2+] = x\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 x [SCN^-] =9 x *0.1=0.9x.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 x [SCN^-]^2 =40 x (0.1)^2=40 x *0.01=0.4x.\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^-]= \u03b23 x [SCN^-]^3=63 x (0.1)^3=63 x *0.001=0.063x.\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{3-}]=\u03b24 x [SCN^-]^4=16 x (0.1)^4=16 x *0.0001=0.0016x.\n\nWait, then the total cobalt concentration is sum of these:\n\nx + 0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x = (1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 )x =2.3646 x.\n\nBut the total c_total is 0.01 M. So, 2.3646 x =0.01 \u2192x=0.01 /2.3646 \u22480.004227 M.\n\nWait, but that gives x as 0.004227 M. Then, [Co(SCN)_2]=0.4 *x =0.4 *0.004227 \u22480.001691 M.\n\nSo, the percentage is (0.001691 /0.01)*100 =16.91% \u2192 approximately 16.9%.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So, that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered the stepwise model, the percentage was about 5.57%. But when using the overall model, it's 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect, and the correct way is to consider the given \u03b2's as overall stability constants, not stepwise.\n\nTherefore, the correct percentage is 16.9%, option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Let me think.\n\nAlright, the problem states that the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2 complex, so that's the second one, \u03b22 maybe? Or wait, wait. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, stability constants are for the formation of complexes. For each complex, the beta is the formation constant. So, Co(SCN)_n would have a beta_n. So, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, with \u03b21=9. The second is [Co(SCN)_2], \u03b22=40. Third is [Co(SCN)_3], \u03b23=63. Fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^3-, \u03b24=16.\n\nWait, but wait, the stability constants are in order: beta1 is for the first complex, beta2 for the second, and so on. So, the blue dithiocyanato complex would be the one with two SCN- ions, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^? Hmm, but I'm not sure about the charge. Maybe that doesn't matter right now.\n\nThe question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which are the ones with two SCN- ions. So, I need to find the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ relative to the total cobalt species.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of all possible Co species: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^{3-}.\n\nSo, the total is c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}].\n\nBut I think the problem gives the total cobalt concentration as 1e-2 M, so that's the sum of all these terms.\n\nWait, but the solution also contains 0.1 M SCN-. So, the concentration of free SCN- is 0.1 M. So, the problem involves the distribution of Co(II) into different complexes based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal.\n\nI think the approach here is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex. The fractions depend on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.\n\nWait, the stability constants are given as \u03b21 to \u03b24. The general approach is to model the formation of each complex step by step.\n\nLet me think about how the distribution works. The fraction of each complex can be found by considering the stepwise formation constants. The fractions are given by the ratios of the beta values multiplied by the ligand concentration.\n\nWait, maybe using the formula for each species' concentration. Let's denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, [CoSCN+] = \u03b21 * x * [SCN^-], [Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 * x * [SCN^-]^2, [Co(SCN)_3^-] = \u03b23 * x * [SCN^-]^3, [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] = \u03b24 * x * [SCN^-]^4.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because each step builds on the previous complex. Alternatively, the formation of each complex is cumulative. So, for the nth complex, the concentration is [Co^n] = \u03b21 * \u03b22 * ... * \u03b2n * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me recall: The overall stability constant for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise constants up to that point. Wait, no, the stepwise constants are for each successive addition. So, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of \u03b21 * \u03b22 * ... * \u03b2n. So, for example, [Co(SCN)_2] would have an overall beta of \u03b21 * \u03b22 = 9 *40=360.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the stability constants given are each for the nth complex, so perhaps the \u03b21 is for the first step (from Co^2+ to CoSCN+), \u03b22 is for the second step (CoSCN+ to Co(SCN)_2), etc. So, each \u03b2 is for adding one SCN- to the previous complex.\n\nIf that's the case, then the formation constants for the complexes would be:\n\n\u03b21 = K1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])\n\u03b22 = K2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-])\n\u03b23 = K3 = [Co(SCN)_3^-]/([Co(SCN)_2][SCN^-])\n\u03b24 = K4 = [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}]/([Co(SCN)_3^-][SCN^-])\n\nSo, to find the fraction of each complex, you can consider the distribution based on these stepwise constants and the ligand concentration.\n\nThe fractions can be found by considering the ratios of the successive terms. So, the fraction of Co(SCN)_n is (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2n) [SCN^-]^n divided by the sum over all m of (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2m) [SCN^-]^m.\n\nWait, but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the relative concentrations by considering the ratios of each complex to the next, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fraction of each complex in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration.\n\nLet me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then,\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 * x * [SCN^-]\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 * [CoSCN+] * [SCN^-] = \u03b22 * \u03b21 x [SCN^-]^2\n[Co(SCN)_3^-] = \u03b23 * [Co(SCN)_2] * [SCN^-] = \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 x [SCN^-]^3\n[Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] = \u03b24 * [Co(SCN)_3^-] * [SCN^-] = \u03b24 \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 x [SCN^-]^4\n\nSo, all concentrations can be expressed in terms of x and [SCN^-].\n\nBut the total cobalt is x + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] = c_total = 1e-2 M.\n\nSo, substituting the expressions:\n\nx + \u03b21 [SCN^-] x + \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN^-]^2 x + \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN^-]^3 x + \u03b24 \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN^-]^4 x = 1e-2.\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [1 + \u03b21 [SCN^-] + \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN^-]^2 + \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN^-]^3 + \u03b24 \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN^-]^4 ] = 1e-2.\n\nSo, x is equal to 1e-2 divided by that sum.\n\nWait, but calculating that sum seems a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers.\n\nGiven:\n\n\u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\n[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm 1: 1\n\nTerm 2: \u03b21 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\nTerm3: \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN]^2 = 40 *9 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6\n\nTerm4: \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN]^3 =63 *40 *9 * (0.1)^3 = 63 *40 *9 *0.001.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n63 *40=2520; 2520 *9=22680; 22680 *0.001 = 22.68.\n\nWait, wait, 63*40=2520? No, 60*40=2400, 3*40=120 \u2192 2520. Yes. Then 2520 *9 = 22680? 2500*9=22500, 20*9=180 \u2192 22680. Then times 0.001 \u2192 22.68.\n\nTerm5: \u03b24 \u03b23 \u03b22 \u03b21 [SCN]^4 =16 *63 *40 *9 * (0.1)^4.\n\nCompute this:\n\n16 *63 = 1008; 1008 *40=40320; 40320 *9=362,880; times (0.1)^4=0.0001 \u2192 362,880 *0.0001 = 36.288.\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n1 (term1)\n\n0.9 (term2)\n\n3.6 (term3)\n\n22.68 (term4)\n\n36.288 (term5)\n\nAdding them all up: 1 + 0.9 =1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.\n\nSo, the sum is 64.468.\n\nSo, x = (1e-2) / (64.468) = 1e-2 /64.468 \u2248 0.0001551 M.\n\nWait, let me compute 1e-2 is 0.01. 0.01 /64.468 = approx 1.551e-4 M.\n\nNow, the fraction of each complex is [complex]/c_total.\n\nBut wait, the fractions are each [complex]/(sum of all complexes), which is x + [CoSCN+] + ... etc. But since we've already expressed everything in terms of x and [SCN], and x is 0.0001551 M, then the fractions can be computed as each term divided by the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is to compute the fraction of each complex relative to the total.\n\nBecause the fractions are [Co^n]/c_total, where [Co^n] is each complex's concentration.\n\nSo, [Co^2+] = x \u2248 1.551e-4 M.\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 x [SCN] = 9 * x *0.1 = 0.9 x = 0.9 *1.551e-4 = 1.3959e-4.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 * [CoSCN+] * [SCN] = 40 * [CoSCN+] *0.1 =4 * [CoSCN+] =4 *1.3959e-4 =5.5836e-4.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should compute each complex's concentration based on x.\n\nWait, [Co^2+] =x =1.551e-4.\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 x [SCN^-] =9 *1.551e-4 *0.1 = 9 *1.551e-5 = 1.3959e-4.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 [CoSCN+] [SCN] =40 *1.3959e-4 *0.1 =40 *1.3959e-5=5.5836e-4.\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^-] = \u03b23 [Co(SCN)_2] [SCN] =63 *5.5836e-4 *0.1 =63 *5.5836e-5=3.520e-3.\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] = \u03b24 [Co(SCN)_3^-] [SCN] =16 *3.520e-3 *0.1=16 *3.520e-4=5.632e-3.\n\nWait, let me compute each step:\n\n[CoSCN+] = 9 *1.551e-4 *0.1 = 9 * 1.551e-5 = 1.3959e-4.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] =40 * [CoSCN+] *0.1 =40 * 1.3959e-4 *0.1 \u2192 40 *1.3959e-5 =5.5836e-4.\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^-] =63 *5.5836e-4 *0.1 \u219263 *5.5836e-5=3.520e-3.\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{3-}]=16 *3.520e-3 *0.1 \u219216 *3.52e-4=5.632e-3.\n\nNow, let's sum all the concentrations to check if it equals c_total=1e-2.\n\nSum:\n\nx =1.551e-4 \u2192 0.0001551\n\n[CoSCN+] =0.00013959 \u21920.0001396\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] =0.00055836 \u21920.0005584\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^-]=0.00352 \u21920.00352\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{3-}]=0.005632 \u21920.005632\n\nAdding them all:\n\n0.0001551 + 0.0001396 = 0.0002947\n\n+0.0005584 \u2192 0.0008531\n\n+0.00352 \u2192 0.0043731\n\n+0.005632 \u21920.0100051 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.01, which is c_total. So, the calculations seem correct.\n\nNow, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2].\n\nSo, [Co(SCN)_2] =5.5836e-4 M.\n\nTotal c_total=0.01 M.\n\nSo, the fraction is 5.5836e-4 / 0.01 = 0.055836 \u2192 5.5836%.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the options are around 16% up to 42%.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Because 5.5% isn't among the options.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the problem says the stability constants are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So, the stepwise constants are as given.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should consider the overall stability constants, not the stepwise ones. Alternatively, perhaps the way I calculated the concentrations is wrong.\n\nWait, another approach is to use the fractions based on the relative contributions. Because the fractions are given by the ratios of the terms in the sum.\n\nThe sum S is 64.468 as calculated earlier. The terms are:\n\nTerm1:1 \u2192 Co^2+ \u2192 1/64.468 \u22480.01551 \u2192 1.551%\n\nTerm2:0.9 \u2192 [CoSCN+] \u2192 0.9/64.468\u22480.014 \u21921.4%\n\nTerm3:3.6 \u2192 [Co(SCN)_2] \u21923.6/64.468\u22485.57% \u21925.57%\n\nTerm4:22.68 \u2192 [Co(SCN)_3^-] \u219222.68/64.468\u224835.18%\n\nTerm5:36.288 \u2192 [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] \u219236.288/64.468\u224856.28%\n\nSo, adding these percentages:1.55+1.4+5.57+35.18+56.28 =100% approximately.\n\nSo, the percentages are:\n\nCo^2+: ~1.55%\n\nCoSCN+: ~1.4%\n\nCo(SCN)_2: ~5.57%\n\nCo(SCN)_3^-: ~35.18%\n\nCo(SCN)_4^{3-}: ~56.28%\n\nWait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is Co(SCN)_2. So, that's 5.57%. But the options are higher than that. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood which complex is blue. Maybe the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2] or perhaps another one.\n\nWait, I recall that in some cases, the color changes with the number of ligands. For example, [Co(SCN)]^+ is pink, [Co(SCN)_2] is blue, [Co(SCN)_3^-] is green, and [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] is brown. So, the blue is the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2], so that's the third term, 5.57% of the total. But the options don't have that. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the way I computed the fractions. Because when I computed the fractions based on the sum S, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 5.57% of the total.\n\nBut the options don't have that. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps I have a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given for the overall complex, not the stepwise. So, \u03b21 is the overall stability constant for [CoSCN]^+, \u03b22 is for [Co(SCN)_2], etc. So, perhaps the calculation is different.\n\nWait, if that's the case, then the formation constants are for each complex. So, [CoSCN+] = \u03b21 [Co^2+][SCN^-]\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^-] = \u03b23 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] = \u03b24 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_2] would be the product of \u03b21 and \u03b22 in the stepwise model. So, perhaps the given \u03b2's are the overall constants, not stepwise.\n\nWait, the problem says the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So, perhaps each \u03b2 is the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.\n\nSo, for [CoSCN]^+, \u03b21=9 \u2192 [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])=9.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2]: \u03b22=40 \u2192 [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)=40.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn that case, the concentrations would be:\n\n[Co^2+] = x\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 x [SCN^-] =9 x *0.1=0.9x.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 x [SCN^-]^2 =40 x (0.1)^2=40 x *0.01=0.4x.\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^-]= \u03b23 x [SCN^-]^3=63 x (0.1)^3=63 x *0.001=0.063x.\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{3-}]=\u03b24 x [SCN^-]^4=16 x (0.1)^4=16 x *0.0001=0.0016x.\n\nWait, then the total cobalt concentration is sum of these:\n\nx + 0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x = (1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 )x =2.3646 x.\n\nBut the total c_total is 0.01 M. So, 2.3646 x =0.01 \u2192x=0.01 /2.3646 \u22480.004227 M.\n\nWait, but that gives x as 0.004227 M. Then, [Co(SCN)_2]=0.4 *x =0.4 *0.004227 \u22480.001691 M.\n\nSo, the percentage is (0.001691 /0.01)*100 =16.91% \u2192 approximately 16.9%.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So, that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered the stepwise model, the percentage was about 5.57%. But when using the overall model, it's 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect, and the correct way is to consider the given \u03b2's as overall stability constants, not stepwise.\n\nTherefore, the correct percentage is 16.9%, option D.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2], among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants and ligand concentration.\n\n### Key Information:\n- Total cobalt concentration: \\( c_{\\text{total}} = 10^{-2} \\, \\text{M} \\)\n- Thiocyanate concentration: \\( [\\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\)\n- Stability constants: \\( \\beta_1 = 9 \\), \\( \\beta_2 = 40 \\), \\( \\beta_3 = 63 \\), \\( \\beta_4 = 16 \\)\n\nThe stability constants are interpreted as **overall stability constants** for the complexes:\n- \\( \\beta_1 \\): \\( [\\text{CoSCN}^+] = \\beta_1 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] [\\text{SCN}^-] \\)\n- \\( \\beta_2 \\): \\( [\\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = \\beta_2 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 \\)\n- \\( \\beta_3 \\): \\( [\\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] = \\beta_3 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 \\)\n- \\( \\beta_4 \\): \\( [\\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{3-}] = \\beta_4 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] [\\text{SCN}^-]^4 \\)\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:\n\\[\nc_{\\text{total}} = [\\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\\text{Co(SCN)_2}] + [\\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{3-}]\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Express each species in terms of \\( [\\text{Co}^{2+}] \\)\n- \\( [\\text{CoSCN}^+] = \\beta_1 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] [\\text{SCN}^-] = 9 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] (0.1) = 0.9 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] \\)\n- \\( [\\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = \\beta_2 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] (0.1)^2 = 0.4 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] \\)\n- \\( [\\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] = \\beta_3 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] (0.1)^3 = 0.063 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] \\)\n- \\( [\\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{3-}] = \\beta_4 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] [\\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] \\)\n\nSubstituting these into the total cobalt concentration:\n\\[\nc_{\\text{total}} = [\\text{Co}^{2+}] + 0.9 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] + 0.4 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] + 0.063 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] + 0.0016 [\\text{Co}^{2+}]\n\\]\n\\[\nc_{\\text{total}} = [\\text{Co}^{2+}] \\left( 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nc_{\\text{total}} = [\\text{Co}^{2+}] \\cdot 2.3646\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\( [\\text{Co}^{2+}] \\)\nGiven \\( c_{\\text{total}} = 10^{-2} \\, \\text{M} \\):\n\\[\n[\\text{Co}^{2+}] = \\frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \\approx 0.004227 \\, \\text{M}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]\n\\[\n[\\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = 0.4 [\\text{Co}^{2+}] = 0.4 \\cdot 0.004227 \\approx 0.001691 \\, \\text{M}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]\nThe percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] is:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\frac{[\\text{Co(SCN)_2}]}{c_{\\text{total}}} \\cdot 100 = \\frac{0.001691}{0.01} \\cdot 100 \\approx 16.9\\%\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2], is **16.9%**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.\n\nWait, I remember that stability constants (\u03b2) are involved in determining the concentration of metal complexes in solution. The higher the \u03b2, the more stable the complex. So, the problem gives me \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. Oh wait, wait, I think the order matters here. Let me think, \u03b2 values usually increase with the order of the complex. So \u03b21 is for Co(SCN), \u03b22 for Co(SCN)2, and so on.\n\nWait, the problem says the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So that's the Co(SCN)_2^(n+) complex, right? So that's the second complex, so \u03b22 is 40. But wait, looking at the \u03b2 values given: \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. Hmm, that's interesting. So \u03b23 is higher than \u03b22. So the third complex is more stable than the second. Wait, but the problem is about the dithiocyanato, which is the second complex. So maybe I need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)2 in the solution.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. So how do I approach this? I think I need to calculate the distribution of cobalt species based on the stability constants. That involves using the \u03b2 values and the concentrations of SCN- and Co(II).\n\nSo, the general approach is to consider all possible complexes and their concentrations. The species present would be Co\u00b2+ (free), Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, Co(SCN)4. Wait, but wait, the \u03b2 values are given up to \u03b24=16. So each \u03b2 is the formation constant for the nth complex.\n\nWait, the formation constants are given as \u03b21, \u03b22, etc. So \u03b2n = [Co(SCN)_n^(2+n)] / ([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n). So to find the concentration of each species, we need to consider all possible complexes and their contributions.\n\nBut calculating all of them might be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the method of successive approximations or the assumption that the most stable complex dominates. But since the problem is asking for the percentage, maybe all species contribute, so I can't ignore any.\n\nWait, let me think. The total concentration of cobalt is c(Co) = 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So the initial concentrations are [Co\u00b2+] = 0.01 M, [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. But as the complexes form, [Co\u00b2+] and [SCN^-] will change.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to use the stability constants to calculate the fractions. Let me consider all the possible complexes and write expressions for each.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define the species as:\n\n1. Co\u00b2+ \u2192 [Co\u00b2+] = x1\n2. Co(SCN) \u2192 [Co(SCN)] = x2\n3. Co(SCN)\u2082 \u2192 [Co(SCN)\u2082] = x3\n4. Co(SCN)\u2083 \u2192 [Co(SCN)\u2083] = x4\n5. Co(SCN)\u2084 \u2192 [Co(SCN)\u2084] = x5\n\nBut wait, the stability constants are given as \u03b21 to \u03b24, which correspond to the complexes from n=1 to n=4. So:\n\n\u03b21 = [Co(SCN)]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]) = 9\n\n\u03b22 = [Co(SCN)\u2082]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^2) =40\n\n\u03b23 = [Co(SCN)3]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^3) =63\n\n\u03b24 = [Co(SCN)4]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^4) =16\n\nSo each \u03b2n is the formation constant for the nth complex.\n\nBut wait, each \u03b2 is relative to the previous one. So to find the concentrations, perhaps we can relate each species to the next.\n\nLet me see. For the first complex, Co(SCN):\n\nx2 = \u03b21 * x1 * [SCN^-]\n\nSimilarly, for Co(SCN)\u2082:\n\nx3 = \u03b22 * x1 * [SCN^-]^2\n\nWait, but that's not considering the stepwise formation. Because Co(SCN)\u2082 can form from Co(SCN) plus another SCN^-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express all species in terms of [Co\u00b2+] and [SCN^-], and then sum them all to get the total cobalt concentration.\n\nSo, for each species:\n\nx2 = \u03b21 x1 [SCN^-]\n\nx3 = \u03b22 x1 [SCN^-]^2\n\nx4 = \u03b23 x1 [SCN^-]^3\n\nx5 = \u03b24 x1 [SCN^-]^4\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because each step involves adding another SCN^-.\n\nWait, another approach: the total concentration of Co is the sum of all species:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.\n\nBut we need to express each x in terms of x1.\n\nLet me see.\n\nFrom \u03b21, x2 = \u03b21 x1 [SCN^-]\n\nFrom \u03b22, x3 = \u03b22 x1 [SCN^-]^2\n\nSimilarly, x4 = \u03b23 x1 [SCN^-]^3\n\nx5 = \u03b24 x1 [SCN^-]^4\n\nWait, but wait, I think I'm missing the fact that each \u03b2 is the formation constant for the nth complex relative to the (n-1)th. So perhaps the step-wise approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the fractions of each species.\n\nLet me think: The fraction of each species can be determined based on the logarithms of the stability constants.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to write the expressions for each species in terms of x1 and then sum them up.\n\nWait, another approach is to calculate the fraction of each species using the \u03b2 values and the [SCN^-] concentration.\n\nThe general formula for the fraction of each species is given by:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN^-] + \u03b21\u03b22 [SCN^-]^2 + \u03b21\u03b22\u03b23 [SCN^-]^3 + ... + \u03b21\u03b22\u03b23...\u03b2(n-1) [SCN^-]^(n-1) )\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me look for a better way.\n\nAlternatively, each subsequent species is formed by adding another SCN^- to the previous complex. So, the ratio between successive species can be determined using the \u03b2 values and the [SCN^-] concentration.\n\nSo, the ratio of [Co(SCN)\u2082] to [Co(SCN)] is (\u03b22 [SCN^-])/ (1) ), since [Co(SCN)\u2082] = \u03b22 [Co(SCN)] [SCN^-] / (\u03b21), because [Co(SCN)] = \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-].\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of successive ratios.\n\nLet me define f_n as the fraction of Co in the nth complex.\n\nThe total concentration of Co is the sum of all f_n multiplied by their respective species' concentrations, but perhaps I can find the ratio of each species.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the distribution of Co among the various complexes.\n\nWe can express each [Co(SCN)_n] in terms of [Co\u00b2+] and [SCN^-].\n\nSo,\n\n[Co(SCN)_n] = \u03b2_n * [Co\u00b2+] * [SCN^-]^n / (product of previous \u03b2's?)\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the stepwise formation. For each step, the formation constant is the ratio between the nth and (n-1)th complex.\n\nWait, the stepwise formation constant, K_n, is the ratio of [Co(SCN)_n] to [Co(SCN)_{n-1}] multiplied by [SCN^-].\n\nSo, K_n = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co(SCN)_{n-1}} [SCN^-]).\n\nBut the overall \u03b2n is the formation constant for the nth complex relative to Co\u00b2+ and free SCN^-.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach is to model the problem as a log cycle.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute the fractions using the formula for each species in terms of the others.\n\nLet me write the expressions for each species.\n\nx1 = [Co\u00b2+] \n\nx2 = \u03b21 x1 [SCN^-]\n\nx3 = \u03b22 x1 [SCN^-]^2\n\nx4 = \u03b23 x1 [SCN^-]^3\n\nx5 = \u03b24 x1 [SCN^-]^4\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because each complex is built upon the previous. For example, x3 is formed from x2 plus another SCN^-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each x_n is related to the previous x_{n-1} by \u03b2_n and [SCN^-].\n\nWait, let me think again. The formation constant for the nth complex is:\n\n\u03b2n = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n)\n\nBut each Co(SCN)_n can be formed by adding an SCN^- to Co(SCN)_{n-1}.\n\nSo, [Co(SCN)_n] = \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n \n\nBut that seems not considering the previous steps. Alternatively, maybe the step-wise approach:\n\nThe step-wise formation constant K_n is [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co(SCN)_{n-1}} [SCN^-]).\n\nSo, K_n = \u03b2n / \u03b2_{n-1} } ?\n\nWait, no. Because \u03b2n = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n) \n\n\u03b2_{n-1} = [Co(SCN)_{n-1}}]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^{n-1})\n\nSo, taking the ratio \u03b2n/\u03b2_{n-1} gives:\n\n([Co(SCN)_n]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n )) / ([Co(SCN)_{n-1}}/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^{n-1} )) )\n\n= [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co(SCN)_{n-1}} ] * [SCN^-]^{-(n - (n-1))} )\n\n= [Co(SCN)_n]/[Co(SCN)_{n-1}} ] * [SCN^-]^{-1}\n\nSo, \u03b2n/\u03b2_{n-1} = [Co(SCN)_n]/( [Co(SCN)_{n-1}} [SCN^-] )\n\nWhich implies that K_n = \u03b2n/(\u03b2_{n-1}) ) = [Co(SCN)_n]/( [Co(SCN)_{n-1}} [SCN^-] )\n\nSo, K_n is the step-wise formation constant for the nth ligand.\n\nSo, using this, we can find the ratio of each species.\n\nSo, for n=2, K2 = \u03b22/\u03b21 = 40/9 \u22484.444.\n\nSimilarly, K3= \u03b23/\u03b22 =63/40=1.575.\n\nK4= \u03b24/\u03b23=16/63\u22480.254.\n\nSo, now, starting from Co\u00b2+:\n\nThe fraction of Co(SCN) is given by:\n\nx2 = x1 * K1 * [SCN^-]\n\nWait, but K1 is \u03b21, since for n=1, K1=\u03b21/1 (since \u03b20 is 1, I think).\n\nWait, no. For n=1, K1 is [Co(SCN)]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]) ) = \u03b21.\n\nSo, x2 = x1 * \u03b21 * [SCN^-]\n\nSimilarly, x3 = x2 * K2 * [SCN^-] = x1 * \u03b21 [SCN^-] * (\u03b22/\u03b21) [SCN^-] ) = x1 \u03b22 [SCN^-]^2.\n\nWait, that's matching the previous expression I had. So, same for x4 and x5.\n\nSo, all species can be expressed in terms of x1.\n\nSo, x1 = [Co\u00b2+]\n\nx2 = \u03b21 x1 [SCN^-]\n\nx3 = \u03b22 x1 [SCN^-]^2\n\nx4 = \u03b23 x1 [SCN^-]^3\n\nx5 = \u03b24 x1 [SCN^-]^4\n\nBut wait, I'm not considering the fact that each x_{n+1} is formed from x_n, but the total is the sum of all x's.\n\nSo, the sum x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.\n\nBut substituting each x in terms of x1:\n\nx1 (1 + \u03b21 [SCN^-] + \u03b22 [SCN^-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN^-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN^-]^4 ) = c(Co)\n\nSo,\n\nx1 = c(Co) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nOnce we find x1, we can find all other x's.\n\nBut wait, let me plug in the numbers.\n\nGiven:\n\n\u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\n[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.\n\nCompute each term in the denominator:\n\nTerm1: 1\n\nTerm2: \u03b21 * [SCN] =9 * 0.1 =0.9\n\nTerm3: \u03b22 * [SCN]^2 =40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4\n\nTerm4: \u03b23 * [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063\n\nTerm5: \u03b24 * [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016\n\nSum all terms:\n\n1 +0.9=1.9\n\n1.9 +0.4=2.3\n\n2.3 +0.063=2.363\n\n2.363 +0.0016=2.3646\n\nSo denominator is approximately 2.3646.\n\nSo x1 = (1e-2) / 2.3646 \u2248 4.225e-3 M.\n\nNow, compute each x:\n\nx1=4.225e-3\n\nx2= \u03b21 [SCN] x1 =9 *0.1 *4.225e-3 =0.9 *4.225e-3=3.8025e-3\n\nx3= \u03b22 [SCN]^2 x1=40*(0.1)^2 *4.225e-3=40*0.01 *4.225e-3=0.4 *4.225e-3=1.69e-3\n\nx4= \u03b23 [SCN]^3 x1=63*(0.1)^3 *4.225e-3=63*0.001 *4.225e-3=0.063 *4.225e-3\u22482.66e-4\n\nx5= \u03b24 [SCN]^4 x1=16*(0.1)^4 *4.225e-3=16 * 0.0001 *4.225e-3=0.0016 *4.225e-3\u22486.76e-6\n\nNow, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)\u2082, so that's x3.\n\nSo, x3 is 1.69e-3 M.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of all x's: 4.225e-3 +3.8025e-3 +1.69e-3 +0.000266 +0.00000676 \u2248 let's see:\n\n4.225e-3 +3.8025e-3 =8.0275e-3\n\n+1.69e-3 =9.7175e-3\n\n+0.000266=9.7441e-3\n\n+0.00000676=9.7447676e-3, which is approximately 0.0097447676 M, which is close to 0.01 M, so our calculation is correct.\n\nNow, the percentage of x3 is (x3 / total Co) *100.\n\nx3 is 1.69e-3.\n\nTotal Co is 0.01 M.\n\nSo (1.69e-3 / 0.01) *100 =16.9%.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)\u2082. So the percentage is 16.9%, which would be option D.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)42.3%\n\nB)25.6%\n\nC)38.1%\n\nD)16.9%\n\nSo D is 16.9%.\n\nBut wait, in my calculation, x3 is 1.69e-3, which is 0.00169 M. The total Co is 0.01 M. So 0.00169 / 0.01 = 0.169, 16.9%.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Are the \u03b2 values given for each complex, or are they step-wise constants? Because in my approach, I used the overall \u03b2n as the formation constant for the nth complex.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Because the \u03b2n is the overall formation constant, not the step-wise. So maybe I should use step-wise K constants instead.\n\nWait, let's double-check. The \u03b2n is the formation constant for the nth complex. So, for Co(SCN)\u2082, \u03b22 is 40, which is [Co(SCN)\u2082]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^2).\n\nBut when calculating the fractions, I think using the overall \u03b2n is correct. So perhaps the calculation is correct, and the answer is D)16.9%.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. I thought that the higher \u03b2n would lead to more of that complex. Here, \u03b23=63 is higher than \u03b22=40. So the third complex is more stable. So the majority of the Co would be in the third complex, not the second.\n\nHmm, but according to my earlier calculation, the third complex has a lower concentration than the second. That doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the x's.\n\nWait, x3 is [Co(SCN)\u2082] = \u03b22 [SCN^-]^2 x1.\n\nWait, no, x3 is \u03b22 x1 [SCN^-]^2.\n\nWait, but in the denominator, the terms are 1, \u03b21[SCN], \u03b22[SCN]^2, etc.\n\nWait, in my calculation, the denominator came out to 2.3646.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct way is to calculate each species's fraction as:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN^-] + \u03b22 [SCN^-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN^-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN^-]^4 )\n\nSo the fraction for Co(SCN)\u2082 is f3 = (\u03b22 [SCN^-]^2) / denominator.\n\nLet me compute denominator again:\n\nDenominator =1 +9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1 =1\n\n9 *0.1 =0.9 \u2192 sum 1.9\n\n40 *0.01=0.4 \u2192 sum 2.3\n\n63 *0.001=0.063 \u2192 sum 2.363\n\n16 *0.0001=0.0016 \u2192 sum 2.3646.\n\nSo denominator is 2.3646.\n\nNow, f3 = (40 * (0.1)^2 ) / 2.3646 = (40 *0.01) /2.3646 =0.4 / 2.3646 \u22480.169, which is 16.9%, same as before.\n\nWait, but that's for f3, which is the fraction of Co(SCN)\u2082. So the percentage is 16.9%.\n\nBut that's option D.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the most stable complex (\u03b23=63) would have the highest concentration. But according to the calculation, the third complex has a lower fraction than the second, which has 3.8025e-3, and the third is 1.69e-3.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because \u03b23 is higher than \u03b22, so the third complex should be more stable, so more of it would form.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe the correct way is to calculate the fraction of each species using the cumulative \u03b2 values.\n\nWait, I think I should use the formula where the fraction of each species is given by:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 \u03b2_k [SCN^-]^k )\n\nWait, no, because \u03b20 is 1 (for Co\u00b2+), \u03b21 for CoSCN, etc. So the formula would be:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 \u03b2_k [SCN^-]^k )\n\nWait, but \u03b20 is 1, so sum is 1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4.\n\nWhich is exactly what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo f3 is 40*(0.1)^2 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.169 or 16.9%.\n\nBut wait, let me compute the fractions for each species.\n\nf1 = 1 / 2.3646 \u22480.4225 \u219242.25%\n\nf2=9*0.1 /2.3646 \u22480.9/2.3646\u22480.3805\u219238.05%\n\nf3=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4 \u21920.4/2.3646\u22480.169\u219216.9%\n\nf4=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063 \u21920.063/2.3646\u22480.0266\u21922.66%\n\nf5=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016 \u21920.0016/2.3646\u22480.000676 \u21920.0676%\n\nAdding up all the fractions: 42.25% +38.05% +16.9% +2.66% +0.0676% \u224899.96%, which is almost 100%, so that's correct.\n\nSo the largest fraction is f1 (Co\u00b2+) at 42.25%, then f2 (CoSCN) at 38.05%, then f3 at 16.9%, which is the dithiocyanato complex.\n\nWait, but that's counterintuitive because \u03b23 is higher than \u03b22. But according to the calculation, the third complex is less than the second.\n\nHmm, why is that? Because the [SCN^-] is only 0.1 M, which is relatively low. So the higher-order complexes may not form as much because the concentration of SCN^- isn't high enough.\n\nSo the calculation suggests that the Co(SCN)\u2082 is about 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Maybe I misread which complex is blue. I thought it's the dithiocyanato (n=2), but perhaps the blue color is for a higher complex.\n\nWait, I'm not certain about the actual colors of the Co(SCN)_n complexes, but the question states that the blue is the dithiocyanato complex, so n=2.\n\nSo according to the calculation, the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)\u2082) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (\u03b2) and the given concentrations of Co\u00b2+ and SCN\u207b. The stability constants are provided as \u03b2\u2081 = 9, \u03b2\u2082 = 40, \u03b2\u2083 = 63, and \u03b2\u2084 = 16, and the concentrations are [Co\u00b2+] = 10\u207b\u00b2 M and [SCN\u207b] = 0.1 M.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Fraction of Each Species**: The fraction of cobalt in each complex is given by:\n   \\[\n   f_n = \\frac{\\beta_n [\\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\beta_k [\\text{SCN}^-]^k}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\beta_0 = 1 \\) corresponds to the free Co\u00b2+ ion.\n\n2. **Denominator Calculation**: Compute the sum in the denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Denominator} = 1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Denominator} = 1 + (9 \\cdot 0.1) + (40 \\cdot 0.1^2) + (63 \\cdot 0.1^3) + (16 \\cdot 0.1^4)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n   \\]\n\n3. **Fraction of Co(SCN)\u2082**: For \\( n = 2 \\), the fraction is:\n   \\[\n   f_2 = \\frac{\\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{40 \\cdot 0.1^2}{2.3646}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f_2 = \\frac{40 \\cdot 0.01}{2.3646} = \\frac{0.4}{2.3646} \\approx 0.169\n   \\]\n\n4. **Percentage of Co(SCN)\u2082**: Convert the fraction to a percentage:\n   \\[\n   f_2 \\times 100 = 0.169 \\times 100 = 16.9\\%\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)\u2082) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option **D**.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.\n\nWait, I remember that stability constants (\u03b2) are involved in determining the concentration of metal complexes in solution. The higher the \u03b2, the more stable the complex. So, the problem gives me \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. Oh wait, wait, I think the order matters here. Let me think, \u03b2 values usually increase with the order of the complex. So \u03b21 is for Co(SCN), \u03b22 for Co(SCN)2, and so on.\n\nWait, the problem says the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So that's the Co(SCN)_2^(n+) complex, right? So that's the second complex, so \u03b22 is 40. But wait, looking at the \u03b2 values given: \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. Hmm, that's interesting. So \u03b23 is higher than \u03b22. So the third complex is more stable than the second. Wait, but the problem is about the dithiocyanato, which is the second complex. So maybe I need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)2 in the solution.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. So how do I approach this? I think I need to calculate the distribution of cobalt species based on the stability constants. That involves using the \u03b2 values and the concentrations of SCN- and Co(II).\n\nSo, the general approach is to consider all possible complexes and their concentrations. The species present would be Co\u00b2+ (free), Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, Co(SCN)4. Wait, but wait, the \u03b2 values are given up to \u03b24=16. So each \u03b2 is the formation constant for the nth complex.\n\nWait, the formation constants are given as \u03b21, \u03b22, etc. So \u03b2n = [Co(SCN)_n^(2+n)] / ([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n). So to find the concentration of each species, we need to consider all possible complexes and their contributions.\n\nBut calculating all of them might be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the method of successive approximations or the assumption that the most stable complex dominates. But since the problem is asking for the percentage, maybe all species contribute, so I can't ignore any.\n\nWait, let me think. The total concentration of cobalt is c(Co) = 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So the initial concentrations are [Co\u00b2+] = 0.01 M, [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. But as the complexes form, [Co\u00b2+] and [SCN^-] will change.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to use the stability constants to calculate the fractions. Let me consider all the possible complexes and write expressions for each.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define the species as:\n\n1. Co\u00b2+ \u2192 [Co\u00b2+] = x1\n2. Co(SCN) \u2192 [Co(SCN)] = x2\n3. Co(SCN)\u2082 \u2192 [Co(SCN)\u2082] = x3\n4. Co(SCN)\u2083 \u2192 [Co(SCN)\u2083] = x4\n5. Co(SCN)\u2084 \u2192 [Co(SCN)\u2084] = x5\n\nBut wait, the stability constants are given as \u03b21 to \u03b24, which correspond to the complexes from n=1 to n=4. So:\n\n\u03b21 = [Co(SCN)]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]) = 9\n\n\u03b22 = [Co(SCN)\u2082]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^2) =40\n\n\u03b23 = [Co(SCN)3]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^3) =63\n\n\u03b24 = [Co(SCN)4]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^4) =16\n\nSo each \u03b2n is the formation constant for the nth complex.\n\nBut wait, each \u03b2 is relative to the previous one. So to find the concentrations, perhaps we can relate each species to the next.\n\nLet me see. For the first complex, Co(SCN):\n\nx2 = \u03b21 * x1 * [SCN^-]\n\nSimilarly, for Co(SCN)\u2082:\n\nx3 = \u03b22 * x1 * [SCN^-]^2\n\nWait, but that's not considering the stepwise formation. Because Co(SCN)\u2082 can form from Co(SCN) plus another SCN^-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express all species in terms of [Co\u00b2+] and [SCN^-], and then sum them all to get the total cobalt concentration.\n\nSo, for each species:\n\nx2 = \u03b21 x1 [SCN^-]\n\nx3 = \u03b22 x1 [SCN^-]^2\n\nx4 = \u03b23 x1 [SCN^-]^3\n\nx5 = \u03b24 x1 [SCN^-]^4\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because each step involves adding another SCN^-.\n\nWait, another approach: the total concentration of Co is the sum of all species:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.\n\nBut we need to express each x in terms of x1.\n\nLet me see.\n\nFrom \u03b21, x2 = \u03b21 x1 [SCN^-]\n\nFrom \u03b22, x3 = \u03b22 x1 [SCN^-]^2\n\nSimilarly, x4 = \u03b23 x1 [SCN^-]^3\n\nx5 = \u03b24 x1 [SCN^-]^4\n\nWait, but wait, I think I'm missing the fact that each \u03b2 is the formation constant for the nth complex relative to the (n-1)th. So perhaps the step-wise approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the fractions of each species.\n\nLet me think: The fraction of each species can be determined based on the logarithms of the stability constants.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to write the expressions for each species in terms of x1 and then sum them up.\n\nWait, another approach is to calculate the fraction of each species using the \u03b2 values and the [SCN^-] concentration.\n\nThe general formula for the fraction of each species is given by:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN^-] + \u03b21\u03b22 [SCN^-]^2 + \u03b21\u03b22\u03b23 [SCN^-]^3 + ... + \u03b21\u03b22\u03b23...\u03b2(n-1) [SCN^-]^(n-1) )\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me look for a better way.\n\nAlternatively, each subsequent species is formed by adding another SCN^- to the previous complex. So, the ratio between successive species can be determined using the \u03b2 values and the [SCN^-] concentration.\n\nSo, the ratio of [Co(SCN)\u2082] to [Co(SCN)] is (\u03b22 [SCN^-])/ (1) ), since [Co(SCN)\u2082] = \u03b22 [Co(SCN)] [SCN^-] / (\u03b21), because [Co(SCN)] = \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-].\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of successive ratios.\n\nLet me define f_n as the fraction of Co in the nth complex.\n\nThe total concentration of Co is the sum of all f_n multiplied by their respective species' concentrations, but perhaps I can find the ratio of each species.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the distribution of Co among the various complexes.\n\nWe can express each [Co(SCN)_n] in terms of [Co\u00b2+] and [SCN^-].\n\nSo,\n\n[Co(SCN)_n] = \u03b2_n * [Co\u00b2+] * [SCN^-]^n / (product of previous \u03b2's?)\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the stepwise formation. For each step, the formation constant is the ratio between the nth and (n-1)th complex.\n\nWait, the stepwise formation constant, K_n, is the ratio of [Co(SCN)_n] to [Co(SCN)_{n-1}] multiplied by [SCN^-].\n\nSo, K_n = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co(SCN)_{n-1}} [SCN^-]).\n\nBut the overall \u03b2n is the formation constant for the nth complex relative to Co\u00b2+ and free SCN^-.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach is to model the problem as a log cycle.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute the fractions using the formula for each species in terms of the others.\n\nLet me write the expressions for each species.\n\nx1 = [Co\u00b2+] \n\nx2 = \u03b21 x1 [SCN^-]\n\nx3 = \u03b22 x1 [SCN^-]^2\n\nx4 = \u03b23 x1 [SCN^-]^3\n\nx5 = \u03b24 x1 [SCN^-]^4\n\nWait, but that can't be correct because each complex is built upon the previous. For example, x3 is formed from x2 plus another SCN^-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each x_n is related to the previous x_{n-1} by \u03b2_n and [SCN^-].\n\nWait, let me think again. The formation constant for the nth complex is:\n\n\u03b2n = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n)\n\nBut each Co(SCN)_n can be formed by adding an SCN^- to Co(SCN)_{n-1}.\n\nSo, [Co(SCN)_n] = \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n \n\nBut that seems not considering the previous steps. Alternatively, maybe the step-wise approach:\n\nThe step-wise formation constant K_n is [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co(SCN)_{n-1}} [SCN^-]).\n\nSo, K_n = \u03b2n / \u03b2_{n-1} } ?\n\nWait, no. Because \u03b2n = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n) \n\n\u03b2_{n-1} = [Co(SCN)_{n-1}}]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^{n-1})\n\nSo, taking the ratio \u03b2n/\u03b2_{n-1} gives:\n\n([Co(SCN)_n]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n )) / ([Co(SCN)_{n-1}}/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^{n-1} )) )\n\n= [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co(SCN)_{n-1}} ] * [SCN^-]^{-(n - (n-1))} )\n\n= [Co(SCN)_n]/[Co(SCN)_{n-1}} ] * [SCN^-]^{-1}\n\nSo, \u03b2n/\u03b2_{n-1} = [Co(SCN)_n]/( [Co(SCN)_{n-1}} [SCN^-] )\n\nWhich implies that K_n = \u03b2n/(\u03b2_{n-1}) ) = [Co(SCN)_n]/( [Co(SCN)_{n-1}} [SCN^-] )\n\nSo, K_n is the step-wise formation constant for the nth ligand.\n\nSo, using this, we can find the ratio of each species.\n\nSo, for n=2, K2 = \u03b22/\u03b21 = 40/9 \u22484.444.\n\nSimilarly, K3= \u03b23/\u03b22 =63/40=1.575.\n\nK4= \u03b24/\u03b23=16/63\u22480.254.\n\nSo, now, starting from Co\u00b2+:\n\nThe fraction of Co(SCN) is given by:\n\nx2 = x1 * K1 * [SCN^-]\n\nWait, but K1 is \u03b21, since for n=1, K1=\u03b21/1 (since \u03b20 is 1, I think).\n\nWait, no. For n=1, K1 is [Co(SCN)]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]) ) = \u03b21.\n\nSo, x2 = x1 * \u03b21 * [SCN^-]\n\nSimilarly, x3 = x2 * K2 * [SCN^-] = x1 * \u03b21 [SCN^-] * (\u03b22/\u03b21) [SCN^-] ) = x1 \u03b22 [SCN^-]^2.\n\nWait, that's matching the previous expression I had. So, same for x4 and x5.\n\nSo, all species can be expressed in terms of x1.\n\nSo, x1 = [Co\u00b2+]\n\nx2 = \u03b21 x1 [SCN^-]\n\nx3 = \u03b22 x1 [SCN^-]^2\n\nx4 = \u03b23 x1 [SCN^-]^3\n\nx5 = \u03b24 x1 [SCN^-]^4\n\nBut wait, I'm not considering the fact that each x_{n+1} is formed from x_n, but the total is the sum of all x's.\n\nSo, the sum x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.\n\nBut substituting each x in terms of x1:\n\nx1 (1 + \u03b21 [SCN^-] + \u03b22 [SCN^-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN^-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN^-]^4 ) = c(Co)\n\nSo,\n\nx1 = c(Co) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nOnce we find x1, we can find all other x's.\n\nBut wait, let me plug in the numbers.\n\nGiven:\n\n\u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\n[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.\n\nCompute each term in the denominator:\n\nTerm1: 1\n\nTerm2: \u03b21 * [SCN] =9 * 0.1 =0.9\n\nTerm3: \u03b22 * [SCN]^2 =40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4\n\nTerm4: \u03b23 * [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063\n\nTerm5: \u03b24 * [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016\n\nSum all terms:\n\n1 +0.9=1.9\n\n1.9 +0.4=2.3\n\n2.3 +0.063=2.363\n\n2.363 +0.0016=2.3646\n\nSo denominator is approximately 2.3646.\n\nSo x1 = (1e-2) / 2.3646 \u2248 4.225e-3 M.\n\nNow, compute each x:\n\nx1=4.225e-3\n\nx2= \u03b21 [SCN] x1 =9 *0.1 *4.225e-3 =0.9 *4.225e-3=3.8025e-3\n\nx3= \u03b22 [SCN]^2 x1=40*(0.1)^2 *4.225e-3=40*0.01 *4.225e-3=0.4 *4.225e-3=1.69e-3\n\nx4= \u03b23 [SCN]^3 x1=63*(0.1)^3 *4.225e-3=63*0.001 *4.225e-3=0.063 *4.225e-3\u22482.66e-4\n\nx5= \u03b24 [SCN]^4 x1=16*(0.1)^4 *4.225e-3=16 * 0.0001 *4.225e-3=0.0016 *4.225e-3\u22486.76e-6\n\nNow, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)\u2082, so that's x3.\n\nSo, x3 is 1.69e-3 M.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of all x's: 4.225e-3 +3.8025e-3 +1.69e-3 +0.000266 +0.00000676 \u2248 let's see:\n\n4.225e-3 +3.8025e-3 =8.0275e-3\n\n+1.69e-3 =9.7175e-3\n\n+0.000266=9.7441e-3\n\n+0.00000676=9.7447676e-3, which is approximately 0.0097447676 M, which is close to 0.01 M, so our calculation is correct.\n\nNow, the percentage of x3 is (x3 / total Co) *100.\n\nx3 is 1.69e-3.\n\nTotal Co is 0.01 M.\n\nSo (1.69e-3 / 0.01) *100 =16.9%.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)\u2082. So the percentage is 16.9%, which would be option D.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)42.3%\n\nB)25.6%\n\nC)38.1%\n\nD)16.9%\n\nSo D is 16.9%.\n\nBut wait, in my calculation, x3 is 1.69e-3, which is 0.00169 M. The total Co is 0.01 M. So 0.00169 / 0.01 = 0.169, 16.9%.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Are the \u03b2 values given for each complex, or are they step-wise constants? Because in my approach, I used the overall \u03b2n as the formation constant for the nth complex.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Because the \u03b2n is the overall formation constant, not the step-wise. So maybe I should use step-wise K constants instead.\n\nWait, let's double-check. The \u03b2n is the formation constant for the nth complex. So, for Co(SCN)\u2082, \u03b22 is 40, which is [Co(SCN)\u2082]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^2).\n\nBut when calculating the fractions, I think using the overall \u03b2n is correct. So perhaps the calculation is correct, and the answer is D)16.9%.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. I thought that the higher \u03b2n would lead to more of that complex. Here, \u03b23=63 is higher than \u03b22=40. So the third complex is more stable. So the majority of the Co would be in the third complex, not the second.\n\nHmm, but according to my earlier calculation, the third complex has a lower concentration than the second. That doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the x's.\n\nWait, x3 is [Co(SCN)\u2082] = \u03b22 [SCN^-]^2 x1.\n\nWait, no, x3 is \u03b22 x1 [SCN^-]^2.\n\nWait, but in the denominator, the terms are 1, \u03b21[SCN], \u03b22[SCN]^2, etc.\n\nWait, in my calculation, the denominator came out to 2.3646.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct way is to calculate each species's fraction as:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN^-] + \u03b22 [SCN^-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN^-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN^-]^4 )\n\nSo the fraction for Co(SCN)\u2082 is f3 = (\u03b22 [SCN^-]^2) / denominator.\n\nLet me compute denominator again:\n\nDenominator =1 +9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1 =1\n\n9 *0.1 =0.9 \u2192 sum 1.9\n\n40 *0.01=0.4 \u2192 sum 2.3\n\n63 *0.001=0.063 \u2192 sum 2.363\n\n16 *0.0001=0.0016 \u2192 sum 2.3646.\n\nSo denominator is 2.3646.\n\nNow, f3 = (40 * (0.1)^2 ) / 2.3646 = (40 *0.01) /2.3646 =0.4 / 2.3646 \u22480.169, which is 16.9%, same as before.\n\nWait, but that's for f3, which is the fraction of Co(SCN)\u2082. So the percentage is 16.9%.\n\nBut that's option D.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the most stable complex (\u03b23=63) would have the highest concentration. But according to the calculation, the third complex has a lower fraction than the second, which has 3.8025e-3, and the third is 1.69e-3.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because \u03b23 is higher than \u03b22, so the third complex should be more stable, so more of it would form.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe the correct way is to calculate the fraction of each species using the cumulative \u03b2 values.\n\nWait, I think I should use the formula where the fraction of each species is given by:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 \u03b2_k [SCN^-]^k )\n\nWait, no, because \u03b20 is 1 (for Co\u00b2+), \u03b21 for CoSCN, etc. So the formula would be:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n [SCN^-]^n) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 \u03b2_k [SCN^-]^k )\n\nWait, but \u03b20 is 1, so sum is 1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4.\n\nWhich is exactly what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo f3 is 40*(0.1)^2 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.169 or 16.9%.\n\nBut wait, let me compute the fractions for each species.\n\nf1 = 1 / 2.3646 \u22480.4225 \u219242.25%\n\nf2=9*0.1 /2.3646 \u22480.9/2.3646\u22480.3805\u219238.05%\n\nf3=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4 \u21920.4/2.3646\u22480.169\u219216.9%\n\nf4=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063 \u21920.063/2.3646\u22480.0266\u21922.66%\n\nf5=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016 \u21920.0016/2.3646\u22480.000676 \u21920.0676%\n\nAdding up all the fractions: 42.25% +38.05% +16.9% +2.66% +0.0676% \u224899.96%, which is almost 100%, so that's correct.\n\nSo the largest fraction is f1 (Co\u00b2+) at 42.25%, then f2 (CoSCN) at 38.05%, then f3 at 16.9%, which is the dithiocyanato complex.\n\nWait, but that's counterintuitive because \u03b23 is higher than \u03b22. But according to the calculation, the third complex is less than the second.\n\nHmm, why is that? Because the [SCN^-] is only 0.1 M, which is relatively low. So the higher-order complexes may not form as much because the concentration of SCN^- isn't high enough.\n\nSo the calculation suggests that the Co(SCN)\u2082 is about 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Maybe I misread which complex is blue. I thought it's the dithiocyanato (n=2), but perhaps the blue color is for a higher complex.\n\nWait, I'm not certain about the actual colors of the Co(SCN)_n complexes, but the question states that the blue is the dithiocyanato complex, so n=2.\n\nSo according to the calculation, the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)\u2082) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (\u03b2) and the given concentrations of Co\u00b2+ and SCN\u207b. The stability constants are provided as \u03b2\u2081 = 9, \u03b2\u2082 = 40, \u03b2\u2083 = 63, and \u03b2\u2084 = 16, and the concentrations are [Co\u00b2+] = 10\u207b\u00b2 M and [SCN\u207b] = 0.1 M.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Fraction of Each Species**: The fraction of cobalt in each complex is given by:\n   \\[\n   f_n = \\frac{\\beta_n [\\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\beta_k [\\text{SCN}^-]^k}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\beta_0 = 1 \\) corresponds to the free Co\u00b2+ ion.\n\n2. **Denominator Calculation**: Compute the sum in the denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Denominator} = 1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Denominator} = 1 + (9 \\cdot 0.1) + (40 \\cdot 0.1^2) + (63 \\cdot 0.1^3) + (16 \\cdot 0.1^4)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n   \\]\n\n3. **Fraction of Co(SCN)\u2082**: For \\( n = 2 \\), the fraction is:\n   \\[\n   f_2 = \\frac{\\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{40 \\cdot 0.1^2}{2.3646}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f_2 = \\frac{40 \\cdot 0.01}{2.3646} = \\frac{0.4}{2.3646} \\approx 0.169\n   \\]\n\n4. **Percentage of Co(SCN)\u2082**: Convert the fraction to a percentage:\n   \\[\n   f_2 \\times 100 = 0.169 \\times 100 = 16.9\\%\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)\u2082) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option **D**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about coordination complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The bigger the beta (\u03b2) value, the more stable the complex.\n\nThe question is about cobalt(II) ions with thiocyanate. The solution has a total cobalt concentration of 1e-2 M and 0.1 M SCN- ions. The stability constants given are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the ones with two SCN- ions attached.\n\nWait, wait. The blue dithiocyanato complexes\u2014I think the color is due to the number of ligands. I remember that Co(II) with different numbers of SCN- can form different colors. Like, maybe [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) where n is 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo the problem is asking for the percentage of the species where the cobalt is in a complex with two SCN- ions, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0 perhaps? Because the question says \"blue dithiocyanato,\" which I think refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the charge here. Oh, wait, each SCN- is -1, so two would be -2. The Co(II) is +2, so the complex would be neutral. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact charge, but maybe it doesn't matter for the calculation.\n\nAnyway, the main point is to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are the dithiocyanato complex (n=2). But wait, the problem says \"blue dithiocyanato\" complexes. Wait, I thought that the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is pink, and [Co(SCN)_3]^3- is blue. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up with other metals. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ as the blue one. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure, but perhaps the question is straightforward and I can proceed with the calculation without worrying about the exact color.\n\nSo, the approach is to consider all possible complexes that cobalt can form with thiocyanate. The possible complexes are [Co], [CoSCN], [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3], [Co(SCN)_4]. Wait, but wait, Co is in +2 oxidation state. So each SCN- is -1, so the charges of the complexes would be:\n\n- [Co]: Co\u00b2+ \u2192 charge +2\n- [CoSCN]: Co\u00b2+ + SCN^- \u2192 charge +1 (since 2+ + (-1) = +1)\n- [Co(SCN)_2]: 2*(\u22121) + 2+ \u2192 0\n- [Co(SCN)_3]: 3*(-1) + 2+ \u2192 -1\n- [Co(SCN)_4]^2-: 4*(-1) + 2+ \u2192 -2\n\nSo all these species are present in the solution, and their concentrations depend on the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN-.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species. So c_total = [Co\u00b2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2\u2212.\n\nBut wait, in the solution, the initial concentration of Co\u00b2+ is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. So, the formation of complexes will depend on the concentrations and the stability constants.\n\nThe stability constants (\u03b2) are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So \u03b2n is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. Wait, but wait, the way \u03b2 is defined can sometimes vary. Usually, \u03b2n is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ion and the ligands.\n\nSo for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2\u2212n), the formation reaction is:\n\nCo\u00b2+ + n SCN^- \u21cc [Co(SCN)_n]^(2\u2212n) ; \u03b2n = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2\u2212n) ] / ( [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n )\n\nBut wait, sometimes \u03b2n can be defined for each step, like \u03b21 for the first ligand, \u03b22 for the second, etc. But in this problem, the given \u03b2 values are for the overall formation of each complex. So, for each n, the overall \u03b2n is the constant for the n-ligand complex.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the way the problem states the stability constants, it says \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So perhaps each \u03b2n is the formation constant for the n-th complex, i.e., the constant for the reaction Co\u00b2+ + n SCN^- \u2192 [Co(SCN)_n]^(2\u2212n), with \u03b2n given.\n\nSo, the first complex is [CoSCN]^+, with \u03b21=9. The second is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, \u03b22=40. Third is [Co(SCN)_3]^- , \u03b23=63. Fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, \u03b24=16.\n\nWait, but wait, the order of \u03b2n might not be in the order of increasing n. Because \u03b23 is the largest (63), which suggests that the [Co(SCN)_3]^- is the most stable complex. But the problem says that the \u03b24 is 16, which is lower than \u03b23. So that would mean that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is less stable than the [Co(SCN)_3]^-.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the concentrations of each complex, including the free Co\u00b2+ ion, and then find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (the dithiocyanato complex) among all species.\n\nBut how do we calculate the distribution of the species?\n\nThe approach is to model the system using the given stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal.\n\nSince the ligand concentration (SCN-) is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the metal concentration (1e-2 M), it's likely that the complexes with higher n will form more. But let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe general approach is to write the expressions for each species' concentration in terms of the free [Co\u00b2+] and the [SCN^-].\n\nLet me denote:\n\n[Co] = [Co\u00b2+]\n\n[CoSCN] = [Co(SCN)]^+ = \u03b21 [Co] [SCN]^1\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 [Co] [SCN]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)_3] = \u03b23 [Co] [SCN]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)_4] = \u03b24 [Co] [SCN]^4\n\nWait, but wait, that's not exactly correct because each \u03b2n is the overall formation constant for the n-th complex. So for each complex, its concentration is \u03b2n multiplied by [Co\u00b2+] multiplied by [SCN^-]^n.\n\nBut wait, the way the \u03b2n is defined, [Co(SCN)_n] = \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n.\n\nSo, all species can be expressed in terms of [Co\u00b2+].\n\nThen, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species plus the free Co\u00b2+:\n\nc_total = [Co] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4] \n\nWhich is:\n\nc_total = [Co] (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nSo, [Co] = c_total / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nWait, but in our case, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and c_total is 1e-2 M.\n\nSo, substituting the numbers:\n\n[SCN] = 0.1 M\n\nc_total = 1e-2 M\n\nSo, let's compute each term in the denominator.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n\u03b21 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\n\u03b22 [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n\u03b23 [SCN]^3 =63 * (0.1)^3 =63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n\n\u03b24 [SCN]^4 =16 * (0.1)^4 =16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n1 (from [Co]) + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = let's compute.\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9\n\n1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3\n\n2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363\n\n2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.\n\nSo the denominator is approximately 2.3646.\n\nTherefore, [Co] = (1e-2) / 2.3646 \u2248 4.227e-3 M.\n\nWait, wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I did that correctly. Because each term in the denominator is the product of \u03b2n and [SCN]^n, right?\n\nWait, but wait: [CoSCN] is \u03b21 [Co][SCN], so the term is \u03b21 [SCN] multiplied by [Co], which in the denominator becomes \u03b21 [SCN] * [Co], but [Co] is factored out, so the denominator is 1 + sum of \u03b2n [SCN]^n terms.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct approach is:\n\nEach complex's concentration is given by [Co(SCN)_n] = \u03b2n [Co][SCN]^n.\n\nThe total cobalt is [Co] + sum over n [Co(SCN)_n].\n\nSo,\n\nc_total = [Co] + \u03b21 [Co][SCN] + \u03b22 [Co][SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [Co][SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [Co][SCN]^4.\n\nFactor out [Co]:\n\nc_total = [Co] (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nSo,\n\n[Co] = c_total / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nSo the denominator is 1 + sum of (\u03b2n [SCN]^n for n=1 to 4)\n\nWait, but in the denominator, the sum starts from n=0? No, because for n=0, the term is 1, which is already included as the first term. So, the denominator is 1 + sum (\u03b2n [SCN]^n) for n=1 to 4.\n\nSo, calculating each term:\n\n\u03b21 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\n\u03b22 [SCN]^2 =40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n\u03b23 [SCN]^3=63 * 0.001=0.063\n\n\u03b24 [SCN]^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016\n\nSum these up: 0.9 + 0.4 =1.3; 1.3+0.063=1.363; +0.0016=1.3646.\n\nDenominator: 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.\n\nSo [Co] = (1e-2) / 2.3646 \u2248 4.227e-3 M.\n\nNow, the concentration of each complex is:\n\n[CoSCN] = \u03b21 [Co][SCN] = 9 * 4.227e-3 * 0.1 = 9 * 4.227e-4 = approx 3.804e-3 M.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately. 4.227e-3 is [Co], multiplied by 0.1 (SCN) gives 4.227e-4. Multiply by \u03b21=9: 9 *4.227e-4=3.8043e-3.\n\nSimilarly, [Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 [Co][SCN]^2 =40 * 4.227e-3 * (0.1)^2 =40 *4.227e-3 *0.01.\n\nLet me compute that: 4.227e-3 *0.01 =4.227e-5. Multiply by 40: 40 *4.227e-5 = 1.6908e-3.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let's compute each term carefully.\n\n[CoSCN] = \u03b21 * [Co] * [SCN] = 9 * (4.227e-3) * 0.1 = 9 * 4.227e-4 = approx 3.8043e-3 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 * [Co] * [SCN]^2 =40 *4.227e-3 * (0.1)^2.\n\n(0.1)^2 is 0.01. 4.227e-3 *0.01=4.227e-5.\n\nMultiply by 40: 40 *4.227e-5 = 1.6908e-3 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_3] = \u03b23 * [Co] * [SCN]^3 =63 *4.227e-3 * (0.1)^3.\n\n(0.1)^3=0.001. 4.227e-3 *0.001=4.227e-6.\n\nMultiply by 63: 63 *4.227e-6 \u2248 2.664e-4 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_4] = \u03b24 * [Co] * [SCN]^4 =16 *4.227e-3 * (0.1)^4.\n\n(0.1)^4=0.0001. 4.227e-3 *0.0001=4.227e-7.\n\nMultiply by 16: 16 *4.227e-7 \u22486.763e-6 M.\n\nNow, the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2], which is the dithiocyanato complex. So, [Co(SCN)_2] is 1.6908e-3 M.\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt species is c_total =1e-2 M. So, the percentage is ( [Co(SCN)_2] / c_total ) * 100.\n\nSo, (1.6908e-3 / 1e-2) *100 = 16.908%.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which matches this. So the answer would be D.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recompute the denominator:\n\nsum = \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4.\n\n= 9*(0.1) = 0.9\n\n40*(0.01) = 0.4\n\n63*(0.001)=0.063\n\n16*(0.0001)=0.0016\n\nSum: 0.9 + 0.4 =1.3; +0.063=1.363; +0.0016=1.3646.\n\nDenominator=1+1.3646=2.3646.\n\n[Co] = (1e-2) /2.3646 \u2248 0.004227 M.\n\nNow, [Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 [Co][SCN]^2.\n\n=40 * 0.004227 * (0.1)^2.\n\n=40 * 0.004227 * 0.01.\n\nCompute 0.004227 *0.01 = 4.227e-5.\n\nMultiply by 40: 40 *4.227e-5 = 1.6908e-3.\n\nSo [Co(SCN)_2] is 1.6908e-3 M.\n\nPercentage: (1.6908e-3 / 1e-2) *100 =16.908%, which is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9% and option C is 38.1%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming which complex is the blue one. Because according to my calculation, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.9% of the total.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. If the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- instead of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, then I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused about which complex is blue. Let me think. I recall that [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. Or maybe [Co(SCN)_3]^- is blue. Alternatively, maybe the [Co(SCN)_2] is pink and [Co(SCN)_3] is blue.\n\nWait, I'm not entirely certain about the colors, but perhaps the question refers to the [Co(SCN)_2] as the dithiocyanato complex, which is the one with two SCN ligands, so the calculation I did applies. So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another approach is to compute the fraction of each complex and see which one is the dithiocyanato. Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the n=2 and n=3 complexes.\n\nWait, the question says \"dithiocyanato\", which implies two SCN- ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is n=2. So our calculation is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be D) 16.9%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about coordination complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The bigger the beta (\u03b2) value, the more stable the complex.\n\nThe question is about cobalt(II) ions with thiocyanate. The solution has a total cobalt concentration of 1e-2 M and 0.1 M SCN- ions. The stability constants given are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the ones with two SCN- ions attached.\n\nWait, wait. The blue dithiocyanato complexes\u2014I think the color is due to the number of ligands. I remember that Co(II) with different numbers of SCN- can form different colors. Like, maybe [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) where n is 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo the problem is asking for the percentage of the species where the cobalt is in a complex with two SCN- ions, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0 perhaps? Because the question says \"blue dithiocyanato,\" which I think refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the charge here. Oh, wait, each SCN- is -1, so two would be -2. The Co(II) is +2, so the complex would be neutral. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact charge, but maybe it doesn't matter for the calculation.\n\nAnyway, the main point is to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are the dithiocyanato complex (n=2). But wait, the problem says \"blue dithiocyanato\" complexes. Wait, I thought that the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is pink, and [Co(SCN)_3]^3- is blue. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up with other metals. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ as the blue one. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure, but perhaps the question is straightforward and I can proceed with the calculation without worrying about the exact color.\n\nSo, the approach is to consider all possible complexes that cobalt can form with thiocyanate. The possible complexes are [Co], [CoSCN], [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3], [Co(SCN)_4]. Wait, but wait, Co is in +2 oxidation state. So each SCN- is -1, so the charges of the complexes would be:\n\n- [Co]: Co\u00b2+ \u2192 charge +2\n- [CoSCN]: Co\u00b2+ + SCN^- \u2192 charge +1 (since 2+ + (-1) = +1)\n- [Co(SCN)_2]: 2*(\u22121) + 2+ \u2192 0\n- [Co(SCN)_3]: 3*(-1) + 2+ \u2192 -1\n- [Co(SCN)_4]^2-: 4*(-1) + 2+ \u2192 -2\n\nSo all these species are present in the solution, and their concentrations depend on the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN-.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species. So c_total = [Co\u00b2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2\u2212.\n\nBut wait, in the solution, the initial concentration of Co\u00b2+ is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. So, the formation of complexes will depend on the concentrations and the stability constants.\n\nThe stability constants (\u03b2) are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So \u03b2n is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. Wait, but wait, the way \u03b2 is defined can sometimes vary. Usually, \u03b2n is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ion and the ligands.\n\nSo for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2\u2212n), the formation reaction is:\n\nCo\u00b2+ + n SCN^- \u21cc [Co(SCN)_n]^(2\u2212n) ; \u03b2n = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2\u2212n) ] / ( [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n )\n\nBut wait, sometimes \u03b2n can be defined for each step, like \u03b21 for the first ligand, \u03b22 for the second, etc. But in this problem, the given \u03b2 values are for the overall formation of each complex. So, for each n, the overall \u03b2n is the constant for the n-ligand complex.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the way the problem states the stability constants, it says \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So perhaps each \u03b2n is the formation constant for the n-th complex, i.e., the constant for the reaction Co\u00b2+ + n SCN^- \u2192 [Co(SCN)_n]^(2\u2212n), with \u03b2n given.\n\nSo, the first complex is [CoSCN]^+, with \u03b21=9. The second is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, \u03b22=40. Third is [Co(SCN)_3]^- , \u03b23=63. Fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, \u03b24=16.\n\nWait, but wait, the order of \u03b2n might not be in the order of increasing n. Because \u03b23 is the largest (63), which suggests that the [Co(SCN)_3]^- is the most stable complex. But the problem says that the \u03b24 is 16, which is lower than \u03b23. So that would mean that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is less stable than the [Co(SCN)_3]^-.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the concentrations of each complex, including the free Co\u00b2+ ion, and then find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (the dithiocyanato complex) among all species.\n\nBut how do we calculate the distribution of the species?\n\nThe approach is to model the system using the given stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal.\n\nSince the ligand concentration (SCN-) is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the metal concentration (1e-2 M), it's likely that the complexes with higher n will form more. But let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe general approach is to write the expressions for each species' concentration in terms of the free [Co\u00b2+] and the [SCN^-].\n\nLet me denote:\n\n[Co] = [Co\u00b2+]\n\n[CoSCN] = [Co(SCN)]^+ = \u03b21 [Co] [SCN]^1\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 [Co] [SCN]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)_3] = \u03b23 [Co] [SCN]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)_4] = \u03b24 [Co] [SCN]^4\n\nWait, but wait, that's not exactly correct because each \u03b2n is the overall formation constant for the n-th complex. So for each complex, its concentration is \u03b2n multiplied by [Co\u00b2+] multiplied by [SCN^-]^n.\n\nBut wait, the way the \u03b2n is defined, [Co(SCN)_n] = \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n.\n\nSo, all species can be expressed in terms of [Co\u00b2+].\n\nThen, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species plus the free Co\u00b2+:\n\nc_total = [Co] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4] \n\nWhich is:\n\nc_total = [Co] (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nSo, [Co] = c_total / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nWait, but in our case, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and c_total is 1e-2 M.\n\nSo, substituting the numbers:\n\n[SCN] = 0.1 M\n\nc_total = 1e-2 M\n\nSo, let's compute each term in the denominator.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n\u03b21 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\n\u03b22 [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n\u03b23 [SCN]^3 =63 * (0.1)^3 =63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n\n\u03b24 [SCN]^4 =16 * (0.1)^4 =16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n1 (from [Co]) + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = let's compute.\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9\n\n1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3\n\n2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363\n\n2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.\n\nSo the denominator is approximately 2.3646.\n\nTherefore, [Co] = (1e-2) / 2.3646 \u2248 4.227e-3 M.\n\nWait, wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I did that correctly. Because each term in the denominator is the product of \u03b2n and [SCN]^n, right?\n\nWait, but wait: [CoSCN] is \u03b21 [Co][SCN], so the term is \u03b21 [SCN] multiplied by [Co], which in the denominator becomes \u03b21 [SCN] * [Co], but [Co] is factored out, so the denominator is 1 + sum of \u03b2n [SCN]^n terms.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct approach is:\n\nEach complex's concentration is given by [Co(SCN)_n] = \u03b2n [Co][SCN]^n.\n\nThe total cobalt is [Co] + sum over n [Co(SCN)_n].\n\nSo,\n\nc_total = [Co] + \u03b21 [Co][SCN] + \u03b22 [Co][SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [Co][SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [Co][SCN]^4.\n\nFactor out [Co]:\n\nc_total = [Co] (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nSo,\n\n[Co] = c_total / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nSo the denominator is 1 + sum of (\u03b2n [SCN]^n for n=1 to 4)\n\nWait, but in the denominator, the sum starts from n=0? No, because for n=0, the term is 1, which is already included as the first term. So, the denominator is 1 + sum (\u03b2n [SCN]^n) for n=1 to 4.\n\nSo, calculating each term:\n\n\u03b21 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\n\u03b22 [SCN]^2 =40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n\u03b23 [SCN]^3=63 * 0.001=0.063\n\n\u03b24 [SCN]^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016\n\nSum these up: 0.9 + 0.4 =1.3; 1.3+0.063=1.363; +0.0016=1.3646.\n\nDenominator: 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.\n\nSo [Co] = (1e-2) / 2.3646 \u2248 4.227e-3 M.\n\nNow, the concentration of each complex is:\n\n[CoSCN] = \u03b21 [Co][SCN] = 9 * 4.227e-3 * 0.1 = 9 * 4.227e-4 = approx 3.804e-3 M.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately. 4.227e-3 is [Co], multiplied by 0.1 (SCN) gives 4.227e-4. Multiply by \u03b21=9: 9 *4.227e-4=3.8043e-3.\n\nSimilarly, [Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 [Co][SCN]^2 =40 * 4.227e-3 * (0.1)^2 =40 *4.227e-3 *0.01.\n\nLet me compute that: 4.227e-3 *0.01 =4.227e-5. Multiply by 40: 40 *4.227e-5 = 1.6908e-3.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let's compute each term carefully.\n\n[CoSCN] = \u03b21 * [Co] * [SCN] = 9 * (4.227e-3) * 0.1 = 9 * 4.227e-4 = approx 3.8043e-3 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 * [Co] * [SCN]^2 =40 *4.227e-3 * (0.1)^2.\n\n(0.1)^2 is 0.01. 4.227e-3 *0.01=4.227e-5.\n\nMultiply by 40: 40 *4.227e-5 = 1.6908e-3 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_3] = \u03b23 * [Co] * [SCN]^3 =63 *4.227e-3 * (0.1)^3.\n\n(0.1)^3=0.001. 4.227e-3 *0.001=4.227e-6.\n\nMultiply by 63: 63 *4.227e-6 \u2248 2.664e-4 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_4] = \u03b24 * [Co] * [SCN]^4 =16 *4.227e-3 * (0.1)^4.\n\n(0.1)^4=0.0001. 4.227e-3 *0.0001=4.227e-7.\n\nMultiply by 16: 16 *4.227e-7 \u22486.763e-6 M.\n\nNow, the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2], which is the dithiocyanato complex. So, [Co(SCN)_2] is 1.6908e-3 M.\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt species is c_total =1e-2 M. So, the percentage is ( [Co(SCN)_2] / c_total ) * 100.\n\nSo, (1.6908e-3 / 1e-2) *100 = 16.908%.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which matches this. So the answer would be D.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recompute the denominator:\n\nsum = \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4.\n\n= 9*(0.1) = 0.9\n\n40*(0.01) = 0.4\n\n63*(0.001)=0.063\n\n16*(0.0001)=0.0016\n\nSum: 0.9 + 0.4 =1.3; +0.063=1.363; +0.0016=1.3646.\n\nDenominator=1+1.3646=2.3646.\n\n[Co] = (1e-2) /2.3646 \u2248 0.004227 M.\n\nNow, [Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 [Co][SCN]^2.\n\n=40 * 0.004227 * (0.1)^2.\n\n=40 * 0.004227 * 0.01.\n\nCompute 0.004227 *0.01 = 4.227e-5.\n\nMultiply by 40: 40 *4.227e-5 = 1.6908e-3.\n\nSo [Co(SCN)_2] is 1.6908e-3 M.\n\nPercentage: (1.6908e-3 / 1e-2) *100 =16.908%, which is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9% and option C is 38.1%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming which complex is the blue one. Because according to my calculation, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.9% of the total.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. If the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- instead of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, then I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused about which complex is blue. Let me think. I recall that [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. Or maybe [Co(SCN)_3]^- is blue. Alternatively, maybe the [Co(SCN)_2] is pink and [Co(SCN)_3] is blue.\n\nWait, I'm not entirely certain about the colors, but perhaps the question refers to the [Co(SCN)_2] as the dithiocyanato complex, which is the one with two SCN ligands, so the calculation I did applies. So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another approach is to compute the fraction of each complex and see which one is the dithiocyanato. Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the n=2 and n=3 complexes.\n\nWait, the question says \"dithiocyanato\", which implies two SCN- ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is n=2. So our calculation is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be D) 16.9%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations to calculate the distribution of cobalt species.\n\n### Key Information:\n- Total cobalt concentration: \\( c_{\\text{total}} = 10^{-2} \\, \\text{M} \\)\n- Thiocyanate concentration: \\( [\\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\)\n- Stability constants:  \n  \\( \\beta_1 = 9 \\), \\( \\beta_2 = 40 \\), \\( \\beta_3 = 63 \\), \\( \\beta_4 = 16 \\)\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is distributed among the free cobalt ion (\\([Co^{2+}]\\)) and its complexes with thiocyanate:\n\\[\nc_{\\text{total}} = [Co^{2+}] + [\\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\\text{Co(SCN)_2}] + [\\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}]\n\\]\nEach complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion:\n\\[\n[\\text{Co(SCN)_n}] = \\beta_n [Co^{2+}] [\\text{SCN}^-]^n\n\\]\nThus, the total cobalt concentration becomes:\n\\[\nc_{\\text{total}} = [Co^{2+}] \\left( 1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4 \\right)\n\\]\nRearranging for \\([Co^{2+}]\\):\n\\[\n[Co^{2+}] = \\frac{c_{\\text{total}}}{1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4}\n\\]\n\n### Calculations:\n1.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nThe problem says that we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN\u207b). The concentration of cobalt is 10^-2 M, which is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I remember that stability constants (\u03b2) tell us about the stability of complexes. A higher \u03b2 means the complex is more stable. The complexes here are Co(SCN)n^2\u2212n, where n is the number of SCN\u207b ligands attached.\n\nThe question asks specifically about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)\u2082\u00b2\u2212 complex. So that's n=2. Wait, but wait, the options are about the percentage of that particular species.\n\nWait, but the stability constants given are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So each \u03b2 corresponds to the formation of the complex with n=1,2,3,4 SCN\u207b ions, respectively. So \u03b21 is for CoSCN\u207a (n=1), \u03b22 for Co(SCN)\u2082^0 (n=2), \u03b23 for Co(SCN)3^- (n=3), and \u03b24 for Co(SCN)4^2\u2212 (n=4).\n\nWait, no, wait, the charge on the complexes. Cobalt(II) is Co\u00b2+. Each SCN\u207b is -1. So for each complex, the charge would be:\n\nn=1: Co\u00b2+ + SCN\u207b \u2192 CoSCN\u207a (charge +1)\nn=2: Co\u00b2+ + 2 SCN\u207b \u2192 Co(SCN)\u2082^0 (charge 0)\nn=3: Co\u00b2+ +3 SCN\u207b \u2192 Co(SCN)3^- (charge -1)\nn=4: Co\u00b2+ +4 SCN\u207b \u2192 Co(SCN)4^2\u2212 (charge -2)\n\nSo the stability constant \u03b2n is for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2\u2212n) from Co\u00b2+ and n SCN\u207b ions.\n\nThe problem is about the percentage of the n=2 complex (Co(SCN)\u2082^0), which is the blue one, I think. So I need to calculate the fraction of Co\u00b2+ that is in the form of the n=2 complex.\n\nBut wait, the solution has free Co\u00b2+ and all these complexes. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, which is the sum of all the species: [Co\u00b2+] + [CoSCN\u207a] + [Co(SCN)\u2082^0] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2\u2212].\n\nBut wait, actually, the total concentration c(Co) is the sum of all the cobalt species, which includes each complex. So that's correct.\n\nI think the approach here is to consider the formation of these complexes and find the fraction of Co that is in the n=2 complex.\n\nThe general approach for such problems is to use the stability constants and the concentrations to calculate the distribution of the species. Since there are multiple complexes, it's a bit complicated because each complex formation affects the others.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can assume that the formation of the complexes is stepwise, and the concentrations are determined by the stability constants and the ligand concentrations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to model the system using the formation of each complex step by step.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the stability constants are given for each complex, and we can model the distribution of each species using these constants.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nThe formation of each complex can be considered as a series of reactions:\n\nCo\u00b2+ + SCN\u207b \u21cc CoSCN\u207a, \u03b21 = [CoSCN\u207a]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN\u207b]) =9.\n\nCoSCN\u207a + SCN\u207b \u21cc Co(SCN)\u2082^0, \u03b22 = [Co(SCN)\u2082^0]/([CoSCN\u207a][SCN\u207b]) =40.\n\nSimilarly for higher complexes.\n\nSo the overall formation for each complex is a stepwise process.\n\nBut to find the fraction of each complex, we need to calculate their concentrations relative to each other and to the free Co\u00b2+.\n\nLet me denote the concentration of Co\u00b2+ as [Co\u00b2+], and [SCN\u207b] as [S] (0.1 M). The total cobalt concentration is c=0.01 M = [Co\u00b2+] + [CoSCN\u207a] + [Co(SCN)\u2082^0] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2\u2212}.\n\nBut that's a bit complicated because each step depends on the previous.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use the concept of the cumulative formation constants. The cumulative constant for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise \u03b2's up to n.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe cumulative constant K_n is the product of \u03b21 * \u03b22 * ... * \u03b2n.\n\nSo for the first complex (n=1): K1 = \u03b21 =9.\n\nn=2: K2 = \u03b21 * \u03b22 =9*40=360.\n\nn=3: K3=9*40*63= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.\n\nn=4: K4=22680 *16= 362880.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if this is correct because each \u03b2 is for the stepwise formation. So the overall formation for the n=2 complex would be Co\u00b2+ + 2 SCN\u207b \u2192 Co(SCN)\u2082^0, and the formation constant K2 is \u03b21 * \u03b22.\n\nWait, no, actually, the overall formation constant for the n=2 complex is \u03b21 * \u03b22. So K2 = \u03b21 * \u03b22 = 9 *40=360.\n\nSimilarly, K3=\u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23= 9*40*63= 22680.\n\nK4=9*40*63*16= 362880.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Alternatively, perhaps each \u03b2 is for the nth complex, so [Co(SCN)_n]^(2\u2212n) = \u03b2n * [Co(SCN)_{n-1}]^(3\u2212n) [SCN\u207b} ].\n\nHmm, but perhaps a better approach is to model the concentrations.\n\nLet me think about all the possible species. Let's denote [Co\u00b2+] as x.\n\nThen, [CoSCN\u207a] = \u03b21 * x * [S] =9x * 0.1 =0.9x.\n\n[Co(SCN)\u2082^0] = \u03b22 * [CoSCN\u207a] * [S] =40 * (0.9x) *0.1 = 40 *0.09x =3.6x.\n\n[Co(SCN)3^-] = \u03b23 * [Co(SCN)\u2082^0] * [S] =63 *3.6x *0.1=63*0.36x=22.68x.\n\n[Co(SCN)4^2\u2212] = \u03b24 * [Co(SCN)3^-] * [S] =16 *22.68x *0.1=16*2.268x=36.288x.\n\nWait, but wait, each step uses the previous concentration. So the concentrations are:\n\n[Co\u00b2+] =x\n\n[CoSCN\u207a] =\u03b21 x [S] =9x *0.1=0.9x.\n\n[Co(SCN)\u2082^0] =\u03b22 [CoSCN\u207a] [S] =40 * 0.9x *0.1= 40 *0.09x=3.6x.\n\n[Co(SCN)3^-] =\u03b23 [Co(SCN)\u2082^0] [S] =63 *3.6x *0.1=63*0.36x=22.68x.\n\n[Co(SCN)4^2\u2212] =\u03b24 [Co(SCN)3^-] [S] =16 *22.68x *0.1=16 *2.268x=36.288x.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the [Co(SCN)4^2\u2212] is higher than the others. But let's check the math.\n\nWait, the problem is that if x is the free Co\u00b2+ concentration, then each complex's concentration is built upon the previous. But wait, that would imply that the higher complexes have higher concentrations, which doesn't make sense because if the ligand is in excess, the higher complexes would form more.\n\nWait, but in this case, the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration (0.01 M). So perhaps the complexes form up to n=4.\n\nBut let's proceed. The sum of all these concentrations should equal the total Co concentration, which is 0.01 M.\n\nSo, sum all the [Co] species:\n\nx + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x =0.01.\n\nLet me add them up:\n\nx (1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) =0.01.\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n1 +0.9=1.9\n\n1.9+3.6=5.5\n\n5.5 +22.68=28.18\n\n28.18 +36.288=64.468.\n\nSo 64.468 x =0.01 \u2192 x=0.01 /64.468 \u22480.000155 M.\n\nWait, but that would make x very small. Let me compute it:\n\n0.01 divided by 64.468 is approximately 0.000155 M.\n\nSo [Co\u00b2+] =0.000155 M.\n\nThen, [CoSCN\u207a] =0.9x=0.9 *0.000155=0.0001395 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)\u2082^0] =3.6x=3.6 *0.000155 \u22480.000558 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)3^-] =22.68 x \u224822.68 *0.000155 \u22480.003515 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)4^2\u2212] =36.288 x \u224836.288 *0.000155 \u22480.005623 M.\n\nWait, but let's check the sum: 0.000155 + 0.0001395 +0.000558 +0.003515 +0.005623 \u22480.0100 (approx 0.01), which matches the total cobalt concentration. So that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)\u2082^0], so that's 0.000558 M.\n\nThe percentage is (0.000558 / 0.01) *100% =5.58%.\n\nWait, but that's not one of the options. The options are 16.9%, 25.6%, etc.\n\nHmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I shouldn't be using the stepwise approach because the \u03b2 values might not be for stepwise formation. Or maybe I have the order wrong.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the \u03b2 values given are for the overall formation constants, not the stepwise. But no, the problem states \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16.\" So each \u03b2n is the stability constant for the nth complex. So the stability constant for the first complex is \u03b21=9, which means [CoSCN\u207a]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN\u207b})=9.\n\nWait, but that would make the first complex's formation more favorable than the second, since \u03b22=40 is higher than \u03b21=9. Hmm, but the stepwise approach might be correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should model the system using the formation of each complex in terms of the overall formation constants, not stepwise. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that the sum is x +0.9x +3.6x +... is incorrect because each complex formation affects the others.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the distribution of the species based on the overall formation constants. Let me think.\n\nThe general approach is to calculate the fraction of each species using their respective \u03b2 values and the ligand concentration.\n\nThe fraction of each complex is given by:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n [S]^n) / (\u03b2_0 [S]^0 + \u03b2_1 [S]^1 + \u03b2_2 [S]^2 + \u03b2_3 [S]^3 + \u03b2_4 [S]^4 )\n\nwhere \u03b2_0 is 1 (since [Co\u00b2+] is the free ion), and [S] is the concentration of SCN\u207b.\n\nSo for each n from 0 to4, the fraction is (\u03b2_n [S]^n) / sum_{k=0 to4} \u03b2_k [S]^k.\n\nWait, but wait, in this case, \u03b2_n is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So the fraction of the nth complex is (\u03b2_n [S]^n) divided by the sum of (\u03b2_k [S]^k) for k=0 to4.\n\nBut in this case, n=2 is the dithiocyanato complex. So the fraction f_2 would be (\u03b2_2 [S]^2) / (sum from k=0 to4 of \u03b2_k [S]^k ).\n\nWait, but let me check this approach. Each \u03b2_k represents the stability of the complex with k ligands. So the fraction of the nth complex is proportional to \u03b2_n [S]^n, because to form the nth complex, you need to add n SCN\u207b ions, each contributing a factor of [S].\n\nSo the denominator is the sum for each possible k of \u03b2_k [S]^k.\n\nSo the fraction for n=2 is (\u03b2_2 [S]^2) / (\u03b20 [S]^0 + \u03b21 [S]^1 + \u03b22 [S]^2 + \u03b23 [S]^3 + \u03b24 [S]^4).\n\nBut wait, \u03b20 is 1, because [Co\u00b2+] is the free ion, and its stability constant is 1 (since it's just the free ion, no complex formed).\n\nSo substituting the numbers:\n\n\u03b20 =1, \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\n[S] is 0.1 M.\n\nSo let's compute each term:\n\n\u03b20 [S]^0 =1 *1=1.\n\n\u03b21 [S]^1=9 *0.1=0.9.\n\n\u03b22 [S]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.\n\n\u03b23 [S]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.\n\n\u03b24 [S]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.\n\nNow, sum all these terms:\n\n1 +0.9=1.9.\n\n1.9 +0.4=2.3.\n\n2.3 +0.063=2.363.\n\n2.363 +0.0016\u22482.3646.\n\nSo the denominator is approximately 2.3646.\n\nThe numerator for n=2 is 0.4.\n\nSo the fraction f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 \u22480.169, or 16.9%.\n\nWait, but the options include 16.9% as option D. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my approach.\n\nBecause the stability constants are given as \u03b21=9, etc., perhaps each \u03b2 is for the nth complex, so the fraction is as I calculated.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the stepwise approach gave me a very low percentage, but that was due to incorrect modeling. This approach seems more accurate because it considers the relative contributions of each complex based on their \u03b2 and [S].\n\nSo according to this calculation, the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species.\"\n\nWait, but in the calculation, I considered all possible complexes, including n=0 (free Co\u00b2+), and all the way to n=4. So the fraction I calculated is correct.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D) 16.9%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)\u2082\u2070, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (\u03b2) and the thiocyanate concentration ([S] = 0.1 M). The total cobalt concentration is given as 0.01 M.\n\nThe stability constants provided are:\n\n- \u03b2\u2081 = 9 (for CoSCN\u207a),\n- \u03b2\u2082 = 40 (for Co(SCN)\u2082\u2070),\n- \u03b2\u2083 = 63 (for Co(SCN)\u2083\u207b),\n- \u03b2\u2084 = 16 (for Co(SCN)\u2084\u00b2\u207b).\n\nThe fraction of each cobalt species is determined by the formula:\n\n\\[\nf_n = \\frac{\\beta_n [S]^n}{\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\beta_k [S]^k}\n\\]\n\nHere, \u03b2\u2080 = 1 (for free Co\u00b2\u207a), and the denominator sums the contributions of all cobalt species.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nThe problem says that we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN\u207b). The concentration of cobalt is 10^-2 M, which is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I remember that stability constants (\u03b2) tell us about the stability of complexes. A higher \u03b2 means the complex is more stable. The complexes here are Co(SCN)n^2\u2212n, where n is the number of SCN\u207b ligands attached.\n\nThe question asks specifically about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)\u2082\u00b2\u2212 complex. So that's n=2. Wait, but wait, the options are about the percentage of that particular species.\n\nWait, but the stability constants given are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So each \u03b2 corresponds to the formation of the complex with n=1,2,3,4 SCN\u207b ions, respectively. So \u03b21 is for CoSCN\u207a (n=1), \u03b22 for Co(SCN)\u2082^0 (n=2), \u03b23 for Co(SCN)3^- (n=3), and \u03b24 for Co(SCN)4^2\u2212 (n=4).\n\nWait, no, wait, the charge on the complexes. Cobalt(II) is Co\u00b2+. Each SCN\u207b is -1. So for each complex, the charge would be:\n\nn=1: Co\u00b2+ + SCN\u207b \u2192 CoSCN\u207a (charge +1)\nn=2: Co\u00b2+ + 2 SCN\u207b \u2192 Co(SCN)\u2082^0 (charge 0)\nn=3: Co\u00b2+ +3 SCN\u207b \u2192 Co(SCN)3^- (charge -1)\nn=4: Co\u00b2+ +4 SCN\u207b \u2192 Co(SCN)4^2\u2212 (charge -2)\n\nSo the stability constant \u03b2n is for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2\u2212n) from Co\u00b2+ and n SCN\u207b ions.\n\nThe problem is about the percentage of the n=2 complex (Co(SCN)\u2082^0), which is the blue one, I think. So I need to calculate the fraction of Co\u00b2+ that is in the form of the n=2 complex.\n\nBut wait, the solution has free Co\u00b2+ and all these complexes. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, which is the sum of all the species: [Co\u00b2+] + [CoSCN\u207a] + [Co(SCN)\u2082^0] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2\u2212].\n\nBut wait, actually, the total concentration c(Co) is the sum of all the cobalt species, which includes each complex. So that's correct.\n\nI think the approach here is to consider the formation of these complexes and find the fraction of Co that is in the n=2 complex.\n\nThe general approach for such problems is to use the stability constants and the concentrations to calculate the distribution of the species. Since there are multiple complexes, it's a bit complicated because each complex formation affects the others.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can assume that the formation of the complexes is stepwise, and the concentrations are determined by the stability constants and the ligand concentrations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to model the system using the formation of each complex step by step.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the stability constants are given for each complex, and we can model the distribution of each species using these constants.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nThe formation of each complex can be considered as a series of reactions:\n\nCo\u00b2+ + SCN\u207b \u21cc CoSCN\u207a, \u03b21 = [CoSCN\u207a]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN\u207b]) =9.\n\nCoSCN\u207a + SCN\u207b \u21cc Co(SCN)\u2082^0, \u03b22 = [Co(SCN)\u2082^0]/([CoSCN\u207a][SCN\u207b]) =40.\n\nSimilarly for higher complexes.\n\nSo the overall formation for each complex is a stepwise process.\n\nBut to find the fraction of each complex, we need to calculate their concentrations relative to each other and to the free Co\u00b2+.\n\nLet me denote the concentration of Co\u00b2+ as [Co\u00b2+], and [SCN\u207b] as [S] (0.1 M). The total cobalt concentration is c=0.01 M = [Co\u00b2+] + [CoSCN\u207a] + [Co(SCN)\u2082^0] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2\u2212}.\n\nBut that's a bit complicated because each step depends on the previous.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use the concept of the cumulative formation constants. The cumulative constant for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise \u03b2's up to n.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe cumulative constant K_n is the product of \u03b21 * \u03b22 * ... * \u03b2n.\n\nSo for the first complex (n=1): K1 = \u03b21 =9.\n\nn=2: K2 = \u03b21 * \u03b22 =9*40=360.\n\nn=3: K3=9*40*63= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.\n\nn=4: K4=22680 *16= 362880.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if this is correct because each \u03b2 is for the stepwise formation. So the overall formation for the n=2 complex would be Co\u00b2+ + 2 SCN\u207b \u2192 Co(SCN)\u2082^0, and the formation constant K2 is \u03b21 * \u03b22.\n\nWait, no, actually, the overall formation constant for the n=2 complex is \u03b21 * \u03b22. So K2 = \u03b21 * \u03b22 = 9 *40=360.\n\nSimilarly, K3=\u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23= 9*40*63= 22680.\n\nK4=9*40*63*16= 362880.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Alternatively, perhaps each \u03b2 is for the nth complex, so [Co(SCN)_n]^(2\u2212n) = \u03b2n * [Co(SCN)_{n-1}]^(3\u2212n) [SCN\u207b} ].\n\nHmm, but perhaps a better approach is to model the concentrations.\n\nLet me think about all the possible species. Let's denote [Co\u00b2+] as x.\n\nThen, [CoSCN\u207a] = \u03b21 * x * [S] =9x * 0.1 =0.9x.\n\n[Co(SCN)\u2082^0] = \u03b22 * [CoSCN\u207a] * [S] =40 * (0.9x) *0.1 = 40 *0.09x =3.6x.\n\n[Co(SCN)3^-] = \u03b23 * [Co(SCN)\u2082^0] * [S] =63 *3.6x *0.1=63*0.36x=22.68x.\n\n[Co(SCN)4^2\u2212] = \u03b24 * [Co(SCN)3^-] * [S] =16 *22.68x *0.1=16*2.268x=36.288x.\n\nWait, but wait, each step uses the previous concentration. So the concentrations are:\n\n[Co\u00b2+] =x\n\n[CoSCN\u207a] =\u03b21 x [S] =9x *0.1=0.9x.\n\n[Co(SCN)\u2082^0] =\u03b22 [CoSCN\u207a] [S] =40 * 0.9x *0.1= 40 *0.09x=3.6x.\n\n[Co(SCN)3^-] =\u03b23 [Co(SCN)\u2082^0] [S] =63 *3.6x *0.1=63*0.36x=22.68x.\n\n[Co(SCN)4^2\u2212] =\u03b24 [Co(SCN)3^-] [S] =16 *22.68x *0.1=16 *2.268x=36.288x.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the [Co(SCN)4^2\u2212] is higher than the others. But let's check the math.\n\nWait, the problem is that if x is the free Co\u00b2+ concentration, then each complex's concentration is built upon the previous. But wait, that would imply that the higher complexes have higher concentrations, which doesn't make sense because if the ligand is in excess, the higher complexes would form more.\n\nWait, but in this case, the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration (0.01 M). So perhaps the complexes form up to n=4.\n\nBut let's proceed. The sum of all these concentrations should equal the total Co concentration, which is 0.01 M.\n\nSo, sum all the [Co] species:\n\nx + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x =0.01.\n\nLet me add them up:\n\nx (1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) =0.01.\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n1 +0.9=1.9\n\n1.9+3.6=5.5\n\n5.5 +22.68=28.18\n\n28.18 +36.288=64.468.\n\nSo 64.468 x =0.01 \u2192 x=0.01 /64.468 \u22480.000155 M.\n\nWait, but that would make x very small. Let me compute it:\n\n0.01 divided by 64.468 is approximately 0.000155 M.\n\nSo [Co\u00b2+] =0.000155 M.\n\nThen, [CoSCN\u207a] =0.9x=0.9 *0.000155=0.0001395 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)\u2082^0] =3.6x=3.6 *0.000155 \u22480.000558 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)3^-] =22.68 x \u224822.68 *0.000155 \u22480.003515 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)4^2\u2212] =36.288 x \u224836.288 *0.000155 \u22480.005623 M.\n\nWait, but let's check the sum: 0.000155 + 0.0001395 +0.000558 +0.003515 +0.005623 \u22480.0100 (approx 0.01), which matches the total cobalt concentration. So that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)\u2082^0], so that's 0.000558 M.\n\nThe percentage is (0.000558 / 0.01) *100% =5.58%.\n\nWait, but that's not one of the options. The options are 16.9%, 25.6%, etc.\n\nHmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I shouldn't be using the stepwise approach because the \u03b2 values might not be for stepwise formation. Or maybe I have the order wrong.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the \u03b2 values given are for the overall formation constants, not the stepwise. But no, the problem states \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16.\" So each \u03b2n is the stability constant for the nth complex. So the stability constant for the first complex is \u03b21=9, which means [CoSCN\u207a]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN\u207b})=9.\n\nWait, but that would make the first complex's formation more favorable than the second, since \u03b22=40 is higher than \u03b21=9. Hmm, but the stepwise approach might be correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should model the system using the formation of each complex in terms of the overall formation constants, not stepwise. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that the sum is x +0.9x +3.6x +... is incorrect because each complex formation affects the others.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the distribution of the species based on the overall formation constants. Let me think.\n\nThe general approach is to calculate the fraction of each species using their respective \u03b2 values and the ligand concentration.\n\nThe fraction of each complex is given by:\n\nf_n = (\u03b2_n [S]^n) / (\u03b2_0 [S]^0 + \u03b2_1 [S]^1 + \u03b2_2 [S]^2 + \u03b2_3 [S]^3 + \u03b2_4 [S]^4 )\n\nwhere \u03b2_0 is 1 (since [Co\u00b2+] is the free ion), and [S] is the concentration of SCN\u207b.\n\nSo for each n from 0 to4, the fraction is (\u03b2_n [S]^n) / sum_{k=0 to4} \u03b2_k [S]^k.\n\nWait, but wait, in this case, \u03b2_n is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So the fraction of the nth complex is (\u03b2_n [S]^n) divided by the sum of (\u03b2_k [S]^k) for k=0 to4.\n\nBut in this case, n=2 is the dithiocyanato complex. So the fraction f_2 would be (\u03b2_2 [S]^2) / (sum from k=0 to4 of \u03b2_k [S]^k ).\n\nWait, but let me check this approach. Each \u03b2_k represents the stability of the complex with k ligands. So the fraction of the nth complex is proportional to \u03b2_n [S]^n, because to form the nth complex, you need to add n SCN\u207b ions, each contributing a factor of [S].\n\nSo the denominator is the sum for each possible k of \u03b2_k [S]^k.\n\nSo the fraction for n=2 is (\u03b2_2 [S]^2) / (\u03b20 [S]^0 + \u03b21 [S]^1 + \u03b22 [S]^2 + \u03b23 [S]^3 + \u03b24 [S]^4).\n\nBut wait, \u03b20 is 1, because [Co\u00b2+] is the free ion, and its stability constant is 1 (since it's just the free ion, no complex formed).\n\nSo substituting the numbers:\n\n\u03b20 =1, \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\n[S] is 0.1 M.\n\nSo let's compute each term:\n\n\u03b20 [S]^0 =1 *1=1.\n\n\u03b21 [S]^1=9 *0.1=0.9.\n\n\u03b22 [S]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.\n\n\u03b23 [S]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.\n\n\u03b24 [S]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.\n\nNow, sum all these terms:\n\n1 +0.9=1.9.\n\n1.9 +0.4=2.3.\n\n2.3 +0.063=2.363.\n\n2.363 +0.0016\u22482.3646.\n\nSo the denominator is approximately 2.3646.\n\nThe numerator for n=2 is 0.4.\n\nSo the fraction f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 \u22480.169, or 16.9%.\n\nWait, but the options include 16.9% as option D. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my approach.\n\nBecause the stability constants are given as \u03b21=9, etc., perhaps each \u03b2 is for the nth complex, so the fraction is as I calculated.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the stepwise approach gave me a very low percentage, but that was due to incorrect modeling. This approach seems more accurate because it considers the relative contributions of each complex based on their \u03b2 and [S].\n\nSo according to this calculation, the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species.\"\n\nWait, but in the calculation, I considered all possible complexes, including n=0 (free Co\u00b2+), and all the way to n=4. So the fraction I calculated is correct.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D) 16.9%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)\u2082\u2070, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (\u03b2) and the thiocyanate concentration ([S] = 0.1 M). The total cobalt concentration is given as 0.01 M.\n\nThe stability constants provided are:\n\n- \u03b2\u2081 = 9 (for CoSCN\u207a),\n- \u03b2\u2082 = 40 (for Co(SCN)\u2082\u2070),\n- \u03b2\u2083 = 63 (for Co(SCN)\u2083\u207b),\n- \u03b2\u2084 = 16 (for Co(SCN)\u2084\u00b2\u207b).\n\nThe fraction of each cobalt species is determined by the formula:\n\n\\[\nf_n = \\frac{\\beta_n [S]^n}{\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\beta_k [S]^k}\n\\]\n\nHere, \u03b2\u2080 = 1 (for free Co\u00b2\u207a), and the denominator sums the contributions of all cobalt species. Substituting the values:\n\n- \u03b2\u2080 [S]\u2070 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1,\n- \u03b2\u2081 [S]\u00b9 = 9 \u00d7 0.1 = 0.9,\n- \u03b2\u2082 [S]\u00b2 = 40 \u00d7 (0.1)\u00b2 = 0.4,\n- \u03b2\u2083 [S]\u00b3 = 63 \u00d7 (0.1)\u00b3 = 0.063,\n- \u03b2\u2084 [S]\u2074 = 16 \u00d7 (0.1)\u2074 = 0.0016.\n\nThe denominator is the sum of these terms:\n\n\\[\n1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\\]\n\nThe numerator for the dithiocyanato complex (n = 2) is:\n\n\\[\n\\beta_2 [S]^2 = 0.4\n\\]\n\nThus, the fraction of Co(SCN)\u2082\u2070 is:\n\n\\[\nf_2 = \\frac{0.4}{2.3646} \\approx 0.169\n\\]\n\nConverting this to a percentage:\n\n\\[\nf_2 \\times 100 \\approx 16.9\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.\n\nThe question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I remember that dithiocyanato would mean it has two SCN- ligands attached. So, the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+ or something like that. The stability constants (beta values) are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. Wait, wait. Wait, what do these beta values represent? Oh right, the stability constant \u03b2n is for the complex with n ligands. So \u03b21 is for CoSCN^+, \u03b22 is for (Co(SCN)_2)^2+, etc.\n\nThe solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So, the problem is to find the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^2+ among all the Co species.\n\nI think I need to calculate the fraction of each complex and then sum the fractions to 100%, but only consider the dithiocyanato complex's percentage.\n\nBut wait, how do I approach this? I remember that the distribution of metal complexes depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligands. The higher the stability constant, the more stable the complex is, so it will be favored.\n\nThe general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the formula:\n\nfraction of complex n = (\u03b2_n * [Co] * [SCN]^n) / sum over all m of (\u03b2_m * [Co] * [SCN]^m )\n\nBut wait, wait. The [Co] here refers to the concentration of the metal ion, right? Because each complex has the metal in it. Oh, but wait, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species. Hmm, no, because [Co] is given as 1e-2 M. So, perhaps the [Co] in the fraction formula is the free [Co^2+] ion. But wait, no, because the total Co is the sum of all the complexes and the free ions. So that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to model the system using the stability constants. Let's think about the possible complexes. The possible species are Co^2+, CoSCN^+, Co(SCN)_2^2+, Co(SCN)_3^3-, Co(SCN)_4^4-.\n\nEach complex is formed stepwise. So, the formation of each complex depends on the previous one. The stability constants are given for each step. So, for each step n, the formation constant \u03b2n is the equilibrium constant for adding one SCN- to the (n-1) complex to form the nth complex.\n\nWait, no. The stability constant \u03b2n is for the complex with n ligands, so the overall reaction is Co^2+ + n SCN^- \u2194 Co(SCN)_n^{2-n} with \u03b2n = [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n).\n\nSo, to find the fractions, I can use the expression for each species:\n\nFor each species i (which has i ligands), the concentration [Co_i] is given by:\n\n[Co_i] = \u03b2_i * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^i / (1 + sum over j=1 to 4 of \u03b2_j * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^j )\n\nWait, no. Wait, the general approach for such problems is to consider all possible complexes and their formation. The fractions are determined by the product of the stability constant and the ligand concentration to the appropriate power, divided by the sum of all such terms.\n\nSo, let me denote the free Co^2+ as [Co]. Then, the concentration of each complex [Co_i] is \u03b2_i * [Co] * [SCN]^i. Because:\n\n[Co_i] = \u03b2_i [Co][SCN]^i\n\nBut wait, the sum of all [Co_i] plus [Co] should be equal to the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 1e-2 M.\n\nSo,\n\n[Co] + sum_{i=1 to 4} [Co_i] = c(Co)\n\nWhich is:\n\n[Co] + sum_{i=1 to4} (\u03b2_i [Co][SCN]^i) ) = c\n\nWe can factor out [Co]:\n\n[Co] (1 + sum_{i=1 to4} \u03b2_i [SCN]^i ) ) = c\n\nSo,\n\n[Co] = c / (1 + sum_{i=1 to4} \u03b2_i [SCN]^i )\n\nOnce we have [Co], we can find each [Co_i] = \u03b2_i [Co] [SCN]^i.\n\nSo, let's compute the denominator term: sum (\u03b2_i [SCN]^i) for i=1 to 4.\n\nGiven [SCN] is 0.1 M. So,\n\nsum = \u03b21*(0.1)^1 + \u03b22*(0.1)^2 + \u03b23*(0.1)^3 + \u03b24*(0.1)^4\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\u03b21=9: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\n\u03b22=40: 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n\u03b23=63: 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n\n\u03b24=16: 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nSo sum = 0.9 + 0.4 = 1.3; 1.3 + 0.063 = 1.363; 1.363 + 0.0016 \u2248 1.3646.\n\nSo denominator becomes 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.\n\nSo [Co] = c / 2.3646. c is 1e-2 M.\n\n[Co] = (1e-2) / 2.3646 \u2248 4.224e-3 M.\n\nNow, compute each [Co_i]:\n\n[Co_1] = \u03b21 [Co][SCN]^1 = 9 * 4.224e-3 * 0.1 = 9 * 4.224e-4 = 3.8016e-3 M\n\n[Co_2] = \u03b22 [Co][SCN]^2 = 40 * 4.224e-3 * 0.01 = 40 * 4.224e-5 = 1.6896e-3 M\n\n[Co_3] = \u03b23 [Co][SCN]^3 = 63 *4.224e-3 * 0.001 =63 *4.224e-6 \u2248 2.662e-4 M\n\n[Co_4] = \u03b24 [Co][SCN]^4 =16 *4.224e-3 * 0.0001 =16 *4.224e-7 \u22486.758e-6 M\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me recalculate each [Co_i]:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute each as [Co_i] = \u03b2_i * [Co] * (SCN^-)^i.\n\nSo:\n\n[Co_1] = 9 * [Co] * 0.1 =9 * (4.224e-3) * 0.1 = 9 * 4.224e-4 \u2248 3.8016e-3 M\n\n[Co_2] =40 * [Co] * (0.1)^2 =40 *4.224e-3 *0.01=40 *4.224e-5=1.6896e-3 M\n\n[Co_3]=63 * [Co]*(0.1)^3=63 *4.224e-3 *1e-3=63 *4.224e-6=2.661e-4 M\n\n[Co_4]=16 * [Co]*(0.1)^4=16 *4.224e-3 *1e-4=16 *4.224e-7\u22486.758e-6 M\n\nNow, the fractions of each species are [Co_i] divided by the total c(Co)=1e-2 M. Because sum of all [Co_i] and [Co] equals 1e-2.\n\nWait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)_2^2+. So that's [Co_2].\n\nSo the fraction is [Co_2] / c(Co) *100%.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the total [Co] in solution is [Co] + [Co_1] + [Co_2] + [Co_3] + [Co_4] =1e-2 M.\n\nSo the fraction of Co_2 is [Co_2]/ ( [Co] + [Co_1] + [Co_2] + [Co_3] + [Co_4] ) ) * 100%.\n\nBut since [Co] + sum [Co_i] = c(Co)=1e-2, the fraction is [Co_2]/(1e-2) *100% = [Co_2]/(c(Co)) *100%.\n\nSo [Co_2] is 1.6896e-3 M. So percentage is (1.6896e-3 / 1e-2) *100% = (0.16896) *100% = 16.896%.\n\nWait, that's approximately 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, [Co_2] is 40 * [Co] * (0.1)^2.\n\n[Co] is 4.224e-3.\n\nSo 40 * 4.224e-3 = 0.16896. Then multiply by (0.1)^2=0.01: 0.16896 *0.01=0.0016896 M.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 40 *4.224e-3 = 0.16896, then multiply by 0.01 (0.1^2), which gives 0.0016896 M.\n\nSo [Co_2] is 0.0016896 M.\n\nc(Co) is 0.01 M. So (0.0016896 / 0.01 ) *100% =16.896%, which rounds to 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option D is 16.9%.\n\nHmm, but wait another moment. Let me re-examine the \u03b2 values. The given \u03b24 is 16. Wait, is that correct? Because sometimes, the stability constants for higher complexes can be lower than the previous ones. So in this case, \u03b24 is 16, which is lower than \u03b23 (63), which makes sense because sometimes adding more ligands can become less favorable.\n\nBut in terms of the calculation, I think the steps are correct.\n\nWait, another thought: Did I compute the denominator correctly? Let me recheck.\n\nsum = \u03b21*(0.1) + \u03b22*(0.1)^2 + \u03b23*(0.1)^3 + \u03b24*(0.1)^4\n\n=9*0.1 =0.9\n\n+40*0.01=0.4 \u2192 1.3\n\n+63*0.001=0.063 \u21921.363\n\n+16*0.0001=0.0016 \u21921.3646\n\nSo sum is 1.3646. Then denominator is 1 +1.3646=2.3646.\n\nSo [Co]=1e-2 /2.3646 \u22480.004224 M.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, [Co_2]=40 *0.004224 * (0.1)^2.\n\n0.1^2=0.01.\n\n40 *0.004224=0.16896.\n\n0.16896 *0.01=0.0016896 M.\n\nSo yes, 0.0016896 /0.01 = 0.16896 \u219216.896% \u219216.9%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but wait the options given:\n\nOptions:\nA) 42.3%\nB)25.6%\nC)38.1%\nD)16.9%\n\nSo the correct answer would be D.\n\nBut wait another thing, I think I might have made a mistake in the way I calculated the [Co_i]. Because the expression [Co_i] = \u03b2_i * [Co] * [SCN]^i is correct, but [Co] is the free [Co^2+] concentration, not the total. So the sum of all [Co_i] and [Co] equals the total Co concentration.\n\nBut in our calculation, we accounted for that by setting [Co] = c / (1 + sum terms), so the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.\n",

Because:\n\n[Co_i] = \u03b2_i [Co][SCN]^i\n\nBut wait, the sum of all [Co_i] plus [Co] should be equal to the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 1e-2 M.\n\nSo,\n\n[Co] + sum_{i=1 to 4} [Co_i] = c(Co)\n\nWhich is:\n\n[Co] + sum_{i=1 to4} (\u03b2_i [Co][SCN]^i) ) = c\n\nWe can factor out [Co]:\n\n[Co] (1 + sum_{i=1 to4} \u03b2_i [SCN]^i ) ) = c\n\nSo,\n\n[Co] = c / (1 + sum_{i=1 to4} \u03b2_i [SCN]^i )\n\nOnce we have [Co], we can find each [Co_i] = \u03b2_i [Co] [SCN]^i.\n\nSo, let's compute the denominator term: sum (\u03b2_i [SCN]^i) for i=1 to 4.\n\nGiven [SCN] is 0.1 M. So,\n\nsum = \u03b21*(0.1)^1 + \u03b22*(0.1)^2 + \u03b23*(0.1)^3 + \u03b24*(0.1)^4\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\u03b21=9: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\n\u03b22=40: 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n\u03b23=63: 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n\n\u03b24=16: 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nSo sum = 0.9 + 0.4 = 1.3; 1.3 + 0.063 = 1.363; 1.363 + 0.0016 \u2248 1.3646.\n\nSo denominator becomes 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.\n\nSo [Co] = c / 2.3646. c is 1e-2 M.\n\n[Co] = (1e-2) / 2.3646 \u2248 4.224e-3 M.\n\nNow, compute each [Co_i]:\n\n[Co_1] = \u03b21 [Co][SCN]^1 = 9 * 4.224e-3 * 0.1 = 9 * 4.224e-4 = 3.8016e-3 M\n\n[Co_2] = \u03b22 [Co][SCN]^2 = 40 * 4.224e-3 * 0.01 = 40 * 4.224e-5 = 1.6896e-3 M\n\n[Co_3] = \u03b23 [Co][SCN]^3 = 63 *4.224e-3 * 0.001 =63 *4.224e-6 \u2248 2.662e-4 M\n\n[Co_4] = \u03b24 [Co][SCN]^4 =16 *4.224e-3 * 0.0001 =16 *4.224e-7 \u22486.758e-6 M\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me recalculate each [Co_i]:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute each as [Co_i] = \u03b2_i * [Co] * (SCN^-)^i.\n\nSo:\n\n[Co_1] = 9 * [Co] * 0.1 =9 * (4.224e-3) * 0.1 = 9 * 4.224e-4 \u2248 3.8016e-3 M\n\n[Co_2] =40 * [Co] * (0.1)^2 =40 *4.224e-3 *0.01=40 *4.224e-5=1.6896e-3 M\n\n[Co_3]=63 * [Co]*(0.1)^3=63 *4.224e-3 *1e-3=63 *4.224e-6=2.661e-4 M\n\n[Co_4]=16 * [Co]*(0.1)^4=16 *4.224e-3 *1e-4=16 *4.224e-7\u22486.758e-6 M\n\nNow, the fractions of each species are [Co_i] divided by the total c(Co)=1e-2 M. Because sum of all [Co_i] and [Co] equals 1e-2.\n\nWait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)_2^2+. So that's [Co_2].\n\nSo the fraction is [Co_2] / c(Co) *100%.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the total [Co] in solution is [Co] + [Co_1] + [Co_2] + [Co_3] + [Co_4] =1e-2 M.\n\nSo the fraction of Co_2 is [Co_2]/ ( [Co] + [Co_1] + [Co_2] + [Co_3] + [Co_4] ) ) * 100%.\n\nBut since [Co] + sum [Co_i] = c(Co)=1e-2, the fraction is [Co_2]/(1e-2) *100% = [Co_2]/(c(Co)) *100%.\n\nSo [Co_2] is 1.6896e-3 M. So percentage is (1.6896e-3 / 1e-2) *100% = (0.16896) *100% = 16.896%.\n\nWait, that's approximately 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, [Co_2] is 40 * [Co] * (0.1)^2.\n\n[Co] is 4.224e-3.\n\nSo 40 * 4.224e-3 = 0.16896. Then multiply by (0.1)^2=0.01: 0.16896 *0.01=0.0016896 M.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 40 *4.224e-3 = 0.16896, then multiply by 0.01 (0.1^2), which gives 0.0016896 M.\n\nSo [Co_2] is 0.0016896 M.\n\nc(Co) is 0.01 M. So (0.0016896 / 0.01 ) *100% =16.896%, which rounds to 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option D is 16.9%.\n\nHmm, but wait another moment. Let me re-examine the \u03b2 values. The given \u03b24 is 16. Wait, is that correct? Because sometimes, the stability constants for higher complexes can be lower than the previous ones. So in this case, \u03b24 is 16, which is lower than \u03b23 (63), which makes sense because sometimes adding more ligands can become less favorable.\n\nBut in terms of the calculation, I think the steps are correct.\n\nWait, another thought: Did I compute the denominator correctly? Let me recheck.\n\nsum = \u03b21*(0.1) + \u03b22*(0.1)^2 + \u03b23*(0.1)^3 + \u03b24*(0.1)^4\n\n=9*0.1 =0.9\n\n+40*0.01=0.4 \u2192 1.3\n\n+63*0.001=0.063 \u21921.363\n\n+16*0.0001=0.0016 \u21921.3646\n\nSo sum is 1.3646. Then denominator is 1 +1.3646=2.3646.\n\nSo [Co]=1e-2 /2.3646 \u22480.004224 M.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, [Co_2]=40 *0.004224 * (0.1)^2.\n\n0.1^2=0.01.\n\n40 *0.004224=0.16896.\n\n0.16896 *0.01=0.0016896 M.\n\nSo yes, 0.0016896 /0.01 = 0.16896 \u219216.896% \u219216.9%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but wait the options given:\n\nOptions:\nA) 42.3%\nB)25.6%\nC)38.1%\nD)16.9%\n\nSo the correct answer would be D.\n\nBut wait another thing, I think I might have made a mistake in the way I calculated the [Co_i]. Because the expression [Co_i] = \u03b2_i * [Co] * [SCN]^i is correct, but [Co] is the free [Co^2+] concentration, not the total. So the sum of all [Co_i] and [Co] equals the total Co concentration.\n\nBut in our calculation, we accounted for that by setting [Co] = c / (1 + sum terms), so the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)_2^2+) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is \\( c(\\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \\, \\text{M} \\), and the thiocyanate concentration is \\( [\\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\). The stability constants are \\( \\beta_1 = 9 \\), \\( \\beta_2 = 40 \\), \\( \\beta_3 = 63 \\), and \\( \\beta_4 = 16 \\).\n\nThe fraction of each cobalt complex is determined by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction of complex } i = \\frac{\\beta_i \\cdot [\\text{Co}] \\cdot [\\text{SCN}]^i}{1 + \\sum_{j=1}^4 \\beta_j \\cdot [\\text{SCN}]^j}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( [\\text{Co}] \\) is the free cobalt ion concentration, which can be calculated using the total cobalt concentration:\n\n\\[\n[\\text{Co}] = \\frac{c(\\text{Co})}{1 + \\sum_{j=1}^4 \\beta_j \\cdot [\\text{SCN}]^j}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the denominator term\nThe denominator is \\( 1 + \\sum_{j=1}^4 \\beta_j \\cdot [\\text{SCN}]^j \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. \n\nThe problem is about cobalt(II) ions in solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (\u03b2) for the different complexes are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.\n\nHmm. So, first, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the \u03b2, the more the complex is favored. The complexes here are different forms of Co with SCN- ligands. The question is specifically about the dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the ones with two SCN- ligands. Wait, but the options mention the blue ones, so maybe that refers to a specific complex like Co(SCN)_n with a particular number of ligands.\n\nWait, the stability constants given are \u03b21 to \u03b24. So, I guess each \u03b2 corresponds to a different complex. So, \u03b21 is for the first complex, \u03b22 for the second, etc. So, the complexes would be Co(SCN)^n where n is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the dithiocyanato would be the n=2 complex, which is Co(SCN)\u2082\u00b2+? But wait, the question is about the blue complexes, which I think refers to the tetraammine dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or something else. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the dithiocyanato is the complex with two SCN- ligands, which would be the n=2 complex. But wait, sometimes in such problems, the complexes are considered in order of increasing n. So \u03b21 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]\u00b2+, \u03b22 for [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2+, \u03b23 for [Co(SCN)\u2083]\u00b3\u2212, and \u03b24 for [Co(SCN)\u2084]^4\u2212? Or maybe it's a different order. Wait, I think the standard is that \u03b2n is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So, \u03b21 is CoSCN\u00b2+ (n=1), \u03b22 is [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2+ (n=2), \u03b23 is [Co(SCN)\u2083]^3+ (n=3), and \u03b24 is [Co(SCN)\u2084]^4\u2212 (n=4). Or wait, maybe the charge isn't directly related to the number of ligands. Let me think: Co\u00b2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^m+, m = 2 - n. So for n=1, m=+1: [CoSCN]^+. For n=2, m=0: [Co(SCN)\u2082]. For n=3, m=-1: [Co(SCN)\u2083]\u207b. For n=4, m=-2: [Co(SCN)\u2084]^2\u2212. So the stability constants are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So each \u03b2n is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands.\n\nThe question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2+ complex, which is the n=2 complex. So, I need to find the fraction of Co in the form [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2+ among all the species present.\n\nSo, the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex and then sum the fractions for the desired complex. The total cobalt species includes the free Co\u00b2+ and all the complexes.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the formation constants are given, but how do I calculate the distribution of the complexes? I think we can model this using the formation constants and the concentrations of the ligand (SCN-). The method involves using the stability constants and the given concentrations to find the fraction of each complex.\n\nThe general approach is to consider all possible complexes and their formation steps. The fraction of each complex depends on the product of the formation constants and the ligand concentration raised to the power of the number of ligands.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact approach. Let me think. The fraction of each complex can be found by considering the formation steps. For example, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n] can be expressed in terms of the total cobalt concentration and the formation constants.\n\nAlternatively, the distribution can be calculated using the following approach. For each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{m}, the fraction f_n is given by:\n\nf_n = (\u03b21 * \u03b22 * ... * \u03b2n * [SCN-]^n) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + ... + \u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2n [SCN-]^n )\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because each \u03b2n is the cumulative formation constant for the nth complex. So for example, \u03b21 = K1 (for n=1), \u03b22 = K1*K2 (for n=2), \u03b23 = K1*K2*K3 (for n=3), etc. So the general term is f_n = (\u03b2n [SCN]^n) / D, where D is the sum over all possible terms for each complex.\n\nSo, D = sum_{k=0 to 4} (\u03b2k [SCN]^k ), where \u03b20 is 1 (the free ion term). Because for each k, \u03b2k is the product of K1*K2*...*Kk. So for k=0, the term is 1 * [SCN]^0 = 1. For k=1, it's \u03b21 [SCN], etc.\n\nSo, the denominator D is 1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the maximum complex is n=4, so we sum up to k=4.\n\nSo, to find the fraction for the dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 case, we take the term with \u03b22 [SCN]^2 divided by D.\n\nBut wait, let me get the \u03b2 values right. The given \u03b2 values are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So, \u03b21 is the formation constant for the first complex (n=1), \u03b22 is the formation constant for the second complex (n=2), etc.\n\nSo, D is 1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4.\n\nWait, but the SCN concentration is given as 0.1 M. Let me plug in the numbers.\n\nSo, [SCN] = 0.1 M.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm 0: 1\nTerm 1: \u03b21 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\nTerm 2: \u03b22 * [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\nTerm 3: \u03b23 * [SCN]^3 =63 * (0.001) = 0.063\nTerm4: \u03b24 * [SCN]^4 =16 * (0.0001) =0.0016\n\nNow sum all the terms:\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9\n1.9 + 0.4 =2.3\n2.3 +0.063=2.363\n2.363 +0.0016= 2.3646\n\nSo D=2.3646.\n\nNow, the fraction for n=2 is (\u03b22 [SCN]^2)/D = 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 let's calculate that.\n\n0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 approximately 0.169, or 16.9%.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Are there two possible complexes with two SCN ligands? Like [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2+ and another isomer? No, I think in this case, the problem is referring to the n=2 complex, which is [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2+. So the fraction is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 16.9%.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Because the \u03b2's given are the cumulative constants, meaning \u03b22 is K1*K2. So when calculating the terms, each term is \u03b2k [SCN]^k. So for k=0, term is 1; k=1, term is \u03b21 [SCN]; k=2, term is \u03b22 [SCN]^2; and so on.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says the stability constants are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So, \u03b21 is the formation constant for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+. \u03b22 is the formation constant for the second complex, [Co(SCN)\u2082]^0. So, the term for [Co(SCN)\u2082] is \u03b22 [SCN]^2.\n\nSo in the denominator D, each term is \u03b2k [SCN]^k, for k=0 to 4.\n\nSo, the calculations I did earlier are correct.\n\nSo, D=1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016=2.3646.\n\nThe fraction for [Co(SCN)\u2082] is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.169, which is 16.9%.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 16.9%.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n",

So, first, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the \u03b2, the more the complex is favored. The complexes here are different forms of Co with SCN- ligands. The question is specifically about the dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the ones with two SCN- ligands. Wait, but the options mention the blue ones, so maybe that refers to a specific complex like Co(SCN)_n with a particular number of ligands.\n\nWait, the stability constants given are \u03b21 to \u03b24. So, I guess each \u03b2 corresponds to a different complex. So, \u03b21 is for the first complex, \u03b22 for the second, etc. So, the complexes would be Co(SCN)^n where n is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the dithiocyanato would be the n=2 complex, which is Co(SCN)\u2082\u00b2+? But wait, the question is about the blue complexes, which I think refers to the tetraammine dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or something else. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the dithiocyanato is the complex with two SCN- ligands, which would be the n=2 complex. But wait, sometimes in such problems, the complexes are considered in order of increasing n. So \u03b21 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]\u00b2+, \u03b22 for [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2+, \u03b23 for [Co(SCN)\u2083]\u00b3\u2212, and \u03b24 for [Co(SCN)\u2084]^4\u2212? Or maybe it's a different order. Wait, I think the standard is that \u03b2n is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So, \u03b21 is CoSCN\u00b2+ (n=1), \u03b22 is [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2+ (n=2), \u03b23 is [Co(SCN)\u2083]^3+ (n=3), and \u03b24 is [Co(SCN)\u2084]^4\u2212 (n=4). Or wait, maybe the charge isn't directly related to the number of ligands. Let me think: Co\u00b2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^m+, m = 2 - n. So for n=1, m=+1: [CoSCN]^+. For n=2, m=0: [Co(SCN)\u2082]. For n=3, m=-1: [Co(SCN)\u2083]\u207b. For n=4, m=-2: [Co(SCN)\u2084]^2\u2212. So the stability constants are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So each \u03b2n is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands.\n\nThe question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2+ complex, which is the n=2 complex. So, I need to find the fraction of Co in the form [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2+ among all the species present.\n\nSo, the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex and then sum the fractions for the desired complex. The total cobalt species includes the free Co\u00b2+ and all the complexes.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the formation constants are given, but how do I calculate the distribution of the complexes? I think we can model this using the formation constants and the concentrations of the ligand (SCN-). The method involves using the stability constants and the given concentrations to find the fraction of each complex.\n\nThe general approach is to consider all possible complexes and their formation steps. The fraction of each complex depends on the product of the formation constants and the ligand concentration raised to the power of the number of ligands.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact approach. Let me think. The fraction of each complex can be found by considering the formation steps. For example, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n] can be expressed in terms of the total cobalt concentration and the formation constants.\n\nAlternatively, the distribution can be calculated using the following approach. For each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{m}, the fraction f_n is given by:\n\nf_n = (\u03b21 * \u03b22 * ... * \u03b2n * [SCN-]^n) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + ... + \u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2n [SCN-]^n )\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because each \u03b2n is the cumulative formation constant for the nth complex. So for example, \u03b21 = K1 (for n=1), \u03b22 = K1*K2 (for n=2), \u03b23 = K1*K2*K3 (for n=3), etc. So the general term is f_n = (\u03b2n [SCN]^n) / D, where D is the sum over all possible terms for each complex.\n\nSo, D = sum_{k=0 to 4} (\u03b2k [SCN]^k ), where \u03b20 is 1 (the free ion term). Because for each k, \u03b2k is the product of K1*K2*...*Kk. So for k=0, the term is 1 * [SCN]^0 = 1. For k=1, it's \u03b21 [SCN], etc.\n\nSo, the denominator D is 1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the maximum complex is n=4, so we sum up to k=4.\n\nSo, to find the fraction for the dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 case, we take the term with \u03b22 [SCN]^2 divided by D.\n\nBut wait, let me get the \u03b2 values right. The given \u03b2 values are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So, \u03b21 is the formation constant for the first complex (n=1), \u03b22 is the formation constant for the second complex (n=2), etc.\n\nSo, D is 1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4.\n\nWait, but the SCN concentration is given as 0.1 M. Let me plug in the numbers.\n\nSo, [SCN] = 0.1 M.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm 0: 1\nTerm 1: \u03b21 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\nTerm 2: \u03b22 * [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\nTerm 3: \u03b23 * [SCN]^3 =63 * (0.001) = 0.063\nTerm4: \u03b24 * [SCN]^4 =16 * (0.0001) =0.0016\n\nNow sum all the terms:\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9\n1.9 + 0.4 =2.3\n2.3 +0.063=2.363\n2.363 +0.0016= 2.3646\n\nSo D=2.3646.\n\nNow, the fraction for n=2 is (\u03b22 [SCN]^2)/D = 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 let's calculate that.\n\n0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 approximately 0.169, or 16.9%.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Are there two possible complexes with two SCN ligands? Like [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2+ and another isomer? No, I think in this case, the problem is referring to the n=2 complex, which is [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2+. So the fraction is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 16.9%.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Because the \u03b2's given are the cumulative constants, meaning \u03b22 is K1*K2. So when calculating the terms, each term is \u03b2k [SCN]^k. So for k=0, term is 1; k=1, term is \u03b21 [SCN]; k=2, term is \u03b22 [SCN]^2; and so on.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says the stability constants are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So, \u03b21 is the formation constant for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+. \u03b22 is the formation constant for the second complex, [Co(SCN)\u2082]^0. So, the term for [Co(SCN)\u2082] is \u03b22 [SCN]^2.\n\nSo in the denominator D, each term is \u03b2k [SCN]^k, for k=0 to 4.\n\nSo, the calculations I did earlier are correct.\n\nSo, D=1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016=2.3646.\n\nThe fraction for [Co(SCN)\u2082] is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.169, which is 16.9%.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 16.9%.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2\u207a) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the given stability constants (\u03b2\u2081=9, \u03b2\u2082=40, \u03b2\u2083=63, \u03b2\u2084=16) and the concentrations of Co\u00b2\u207a (10\u207b\u00b2 M) and SCN\u207b (0.1 M). The fraction of each cobalt complex is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf_n = \\frac{\\beta_n [\\text{SCN}]^n}{D},\n\\]\nwhere \\(D = 1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}]^4\\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the denominator \\(D\\)\nSubstitute the given values:\n- \\([SCN] = 0.1 \\, \\text{M}\\),\n- \\(\\beta_1 = 9\\), \\(\\beta_2 = 40\\), \\(\\beta_3 = 63\\), \\(\\beta_4 = 16\\).\n\n\\[\nD = 1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}]^4\n\\]\n\nCompute each term:\n- \\(1 = 1\\),\n- \\(\\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}] = 9 \\cdot 0.1 = 0.9\\),\n- \\(\\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \\cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \\cdot 0.01 = 0.4\\),\n- \\(\\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \\cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \\cdot 0.001 = 0.063\\),\n- \\(\\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \\cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \\cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016\\).\n\nSum these terms:\n\\[\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2\u207a\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:\n\\[\nf_2 = \\frac{\\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}]^2}{D}.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\\[\nf_2 = \\frac{0.4}{2.3646}.\n\\]\n\nPerform the division:\n\\[\nf_2 \\approx 0.169.\n\\]\n\nConvert to percentage:\n\\[\nf_2 \\approx 16.9\\%.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.\n\nSo, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) are given for four complexes: \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.\n\nWait, blue dithiocyanato... I think that refers to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is blue. But wait, no, wait. Let me think. Cobalt complexes with different SCN- ligands can have different colors. The blue one is usually the tetrathiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)_4]^2\u2212, which is blue. Oh wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, I think the blue one is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or is it [Co(SCN)_4]^2\u2212? I remember that [Co(SCN)_4]^2\u2212 is blue, and [Co(SCN)_3]^\u2212 is maybe another color. Hmm, but the question refers to the blue dithiocyanato, which would be two SCN- groups. So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So that would be the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} species. So I need to find what fraction of all the cobalt species is in this form.\n\nThe stability constants are \u03b21 to \u03b24. Stability constant, \u03b2, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For example, \u03b21 would be for [Co(SCN)]+ since it's the first complex. Wait, how do the complexes form? Let me think. The general formation would be:\n\nCo\u00b2+ + n SCN^- \u21cc [Co(SCN)_n]^{2\u2212n}\n\nSo for each n, the complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2\u2212n}.\n\nThe stability constant \u03b2n is given by:\n\n\u03b2n = [ [Co(SCN)_n^{2\u2212n} ] ] / ( [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n )\n\nSo for each n, the complex is formed stepwise, with each \u03b2n being the equilibrium for adding the nth SCN^-.\n\nWait, but wait, the way these \u03b2 values are given, are they for each step or for the overall formation? Like, \u03b21 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, \u03b22 would be for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, \u03b23 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and \u03b24 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2\u2212}.\n\nSo, each \u03b2n is the equilibrium constant for the nth step.\n\nSo, the overall formation constants for each complex can be found by multiplying the previous \u03b2's. Or wait, perhaps each \u03b2n is the cumulative constant for the complex up to n SCN ligands. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, the problem says \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16.\" So each \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So, \u03b21 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, \u03b22 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, \u03b23 for [Co(SCN)_3]^\u2212, and \u03b24 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2\u2212}.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because \u03b24 is 16, which is lower than \u03b23. Usually, the stability constants increase with the number of ligands, but maybe in this case, it's not. So, the complexes form up to four SCN ligands, but the \u03b24 is lower. Hmm.\n\nWait, I think perhaps I got the way the stability constants are defined wrong. Maybe each \u03b2n is the stepwise formation constant for adding the nth ligand. So, \u03b21 is K1 = [CoSCN+]/( [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-] ), \u03b22 is K2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/( [CoSCN+][SCN^-] ), and so on. Then, the overall \u03b2 for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of K1*K2*...*Kn.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if that's the case, then the overall \u03b2 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2\u2212} would be \u03b21 * \u03b22 * \u03b23 * \u03b24. But wait, in the problem statement, the \u03b2's are given as 9,40,63,16. So, the overall \u03b2 for each complex would be the product of the \u03b2's up to that point.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says \"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16.\" So, perhaps each \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN ligands. So, \u03b21=9 is for [CoSCN]+, \u03b22=40 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, \u03b23=63 for [Co(SCN)_3]^\u2212, and \u03b24=16 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2\u2212}.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the stability constant decreases for n=4 compared to n=3, which is a bit odd, but maybe possible.\n\nHmm, but then, in that case, how do we proceed? Because the problem is asking about the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, I think. So its stability constant is \u03b22=40.\n\nWait, but in any case, the solution will involve finding the fraction of each cobalt species (from n=0 to n=4) and then summing the fractions of the desired species.\n\nSo, the approach is to model the distribution of Co(II) among the different complexes. Each complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, where n can be 0 (free Co\u00b2+), 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nThe fraction of each species can be found using the stability constants and the concentrations of Co\u00b2+ and SCN^-.\n\nWait, but the total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So, the sum of all species [Co\u00b2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^- ] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}] = 1e-2 M.\n\nSimilarly, the SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M, but some of it is tied up in the complexes. So, the total SCN is [SCN^-] + 4*[Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}] + 3*[Co(SCN)_3^- ] + 2*[Co(SCN)_2] + 1*[CoSCN+] = 0.1 M. But since the SCN concentration is much higher (0.1 M is 1e-1, and the Co is 1e-2), the free SCN^- is much higher than the bound, so perhaps it's a good approximation to consider [SCN^-] as approximately 0.1 M, especially since the problem doesn't give any other info.\n\nWait, but maybe we should not make that approximation because the amount of SCN bound could be significant? Let's think. The total Co is 0.01 M, and each Co can bind up to 4 SCN. So maximum SCN consumed is 0.01 *4=0.04 M. But the initial SCN is 0.1 M, so the free SCN would be 0.1 - 0.04 =0.06 M. So, it's about 60% less. So, maybe the free SCN can't be approximated as 0.1. Hmm, but 0.06 is still higher than 0.04, so perhaps the approximation is okay, but maybe not. But perhaps the problem expects us to use the given [SCN^-] as 0.1 M, ignoring any binding effect. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it without the approximation.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think: in such cases, the solution is often to assume that the free [SCN^-] is approximately 0.1 M, because the amount bound is small compared to the initial concentration. So, perhaps in this problem, that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants us to calculate the exact [SCN^-], but that would complicate things. Let's proceed under the assumption that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and see where that gets us. If the approximation is wrong, the answer might be off, but perhaps it's what's intended.\n\nSo, the idea is to calculate the fraction of each Co species, then sum the fractions of the desired species (the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the n=2 species) relative to the total.\n\nTo find the fractions, we can use the stability constants and the concentrations. The general approach is to use the formation equations and the stability constants to express the concentration of each species in terms of the free Co\u00b2+ concentration.\n\nLet me denote [Co\u00b2+] as x. Then, each complex can be expressed as:\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 * x * [SCN^-]\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 * x * [SCN^-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^- ] = \u03b23 * x * [SCN^-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}] = \u03b24 * x * [SCN^-]^4\n\nWait, no. Wait, the overall stability constant for each complex is the product of the stepwise \u03b2's up to that point. So, for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, the \u03b2 is \u03b21 * \u03b22 * ... * \u03b2n.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the \u03b2's given are for each complex. For example, \u03b21 is the stability constant for [CoSCN+] (n=1), \u03b22 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), etc. So perhaps each \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands.\n\nSo, for [CoSCN+], \u03b21=9, so [CoSCN+] = \u03b21 * [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]\n\nSimilarly, [Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 * [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^2\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the concentrations of each complex are:\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 * x * [SCN^-]\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 * x * [SCN^-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^- ] = \u03b23 * x * [SCN^-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}] = \u03b24 * x * [SCN^-]^4\n\nWhere x is [Co\u00b2+], the free cobalt ion concentration.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is:\n\nx + \u03b21 x [SCN^-] + \u03b22 x [SCN^-]^2 + \u03b23 x [SCN^-]^3 + \u03b24 x [SCN^-]^4 = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.\n\nWe can factor out x:\n\nx [1 + \u03b21 [SCN^-] + \u03b22 [SCN^-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN^-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN^-]^4 ] = 1e-2.\n\nWe can solve for x.\n\nGiven that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, let's compute each term.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n\u03b21 [SCN^-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\n\u03b22 [SCN^-]^2 =40 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01=0.4\n\n\u03b23 [SCN^-]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063\n\n\u03b24 [SCN^-]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016\n\nNow sum these:\n\n1 (from the x term) + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1 + 0.9=1.9; 1.9+0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.\n\nSo the denominator becomes 2.3646.\n\nThen,\n\nx = (1e-2) / 2.3646 \u2248 0.004225 M.\n\nWait, let me compute 1e-2 / 2.3646.\n\n1e-2 is 0.01. 0.01 divided by 2.3646.\n\nLet me compute 0.01 / 2.3646. Let me approximate 2.3646 \u22482.365. 0.01 /2.365 \u22480.004225.\n\nSo x \u2248 0.004225 M.\n\nNow, the concentrations of each complex are:\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 x [SCN^-] =9 *0.004225 *0.1 = 9 *0.0004225=0.0038025 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 x [SCN^-]^2=40 *0.004225 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.004225 *0.01=40 * 0.00004225=0.00169 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^- ] =63 *0.004225 * (0.1)^3=63 *0.004225 *0.001=63 *4.225e-6= approx 2.66e-4 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}] =16 *0.004225 * (0.1)^4=16 *0.004225 *0.0001=16 *4.225e-8=6.76e-7 M.\n\nNow, let's sum all these concentrations plus x to see if they add up to 0.01 M.\n\nx =0.004225\n\n[CoSCN+] =0.0038025\n\n[Co(SCN)_2]=0.00169\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^- ]=0.000000266 (approx 2.66e-4)\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}]=6.76e-7\n\nAdding them up:\n\n0.004225 +0.0038025 = 0.0080275\n\n+0.00169 = 0.0097175\n\n+0.000266 =0.0099835\n\n+0.000000676 \u22480.009984176.\n\nWait, but the total should be 0.01 M. Hmm, seems like it's about 0.009984, which is close to 0.01, so perhaps the approximation is acceptable, considering rounding errors.\n\nNow, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. The concentration of this is 0.00169 M.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. So the fraction is 0.00169 / 0.01 = 0.169, or 16.9%.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, because the question says \"the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes,\" which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the calculations.\n\nx was found as 0.004225 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] is 40 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^2.\n\n(0.1)^2 is 0.01.\n\nSo 40 *0.004225 =0.169.\n\n0.169 *0.01=0.00169 M.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the fraction is (0.00169)/(0.01) =0.169, 16.9%.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 16.9%, so that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem gave \u03b24 as 16, which is lower than \u03b23=63. So the formation of higher complexes may not be as favored. So the majority might be in lower n complexes. But according to our calculation, [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.9%, which is about 17%, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that each \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. Because in reality, the \u03b2n could be the stepwise constants, and the overall \u03b2 for each complex is the product of the previous \u03b2's.\n\nWait, that's a critical point. Let me think again.\n\nIf \u03b21 is the first stepwise constant, \u03b22 is the second, etc., then the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of \u03b21 to \u03b2n.\n\nSo, for example, [Co(SCN)_2] would have an overall \u03b2 of \u03b21 * \u03b22.\n\nIn that case, the concentrations would be:\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 x [SCN^-]\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b21 \u03b22 x [SCN^-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^- ] = \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 x [SCN^-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}] = \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 x [SCN^-]^4\n\nAh, this is a different approach. So the earlier approach I took may have been incorrect because I assumed each \u03b2n was the overall for n ligands, but perhaps they are the stepwise.\n\nSo, if that's the case, the overall \u03b2 for each complex would be the product of the stepwise \u03b2's up to n.\n\nSo, let's reevaluate.\n\nIn that case, the concentrations are:\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 x [SCN^-]\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b21 \u03b22 x [SCN^-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^- ] = \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 x [SCN^-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}] = \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 x [SCN^-]^4\n\nSo, the denominator in the equation would be:\n\nx [1 + \u03b21 [SCN^-] + \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN^-]^2 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [SCN^-]^3 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [SCN^-]^4 ] = c(Co) =1e-2 M.\n\nSo, let's compute each term with this approach.\n\nGiven \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\nCompute each term inside the brackets:\n\nTerm 0: 1\n\nTerm1: \u03b21 [SCN^-] =9 *0.1=0.9\n\nTerm2: \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN^-]^2=9 *40 * (0.1)^2= 360 * 0.01=3.6\n\nTerm3: \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [SCN^-]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) *0.001=22.68\n\nTerm4: \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [SCN^-]^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4= let's compute 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880. Multiply by (0.1)^4=0.0001.

The options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding what the \u03b2's are. Because in the first approach, where each \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for n ligands, the percentage was 16.9%, which is option D. But in the second approach, where \u03b2n are stepwise constants, the percentage is about 5.5%, which is not an option.\n\nSo, the problem must be in the initial assumption about the \u03b2n.\n\nWait, the problem states, \"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16.\" So, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Are these the overall constants for each complex, or the stepwise constants for each addition?\n\nIn the context of stability constants, when someone says the stability constants of the complexes, they usually refer to the overall constants. So, each \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands.\n\nIn that case, the first approach is correct, and the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, in the first approach, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00169 M, which is 16.9% of 0.01 M. So that's option D.\n\nSo why in the second approach, where \u03b2n are stepwise, the percentage is much lower and doesn't match any option?\n\nI think the problem statement is using the \u03b2n as the overall stability constants for the complex with n ligands. So, the first approach is correct, leading to option D.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: perhaps the complexes have different charges, and the [SCN^-] concentrations in their expressions are different.\n\nWait, the general expression for each complex is:\n\n[Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n.\n\nSo, yes, that's the correct way.\n\nSo, in the first approach, the calculation leads to 16.9% for [Co(SCN)_2], which is option D.\n\nBut why in the second approach, the percentage is lower? Because that approach assumes the \u03b2n are stepwise, leading to a much higher concentration in higher n complexes.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects the first approach, because in the first approach, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nBut let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 42.3%\n\nB) 25.6%\n\nC) 38.1%\n\nD) 16.9%\n\nSo, option D is 16.9%.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check the first approach's calculations.\n\nIn the first approach, the denominator was 2.3646, leading to x=0.004225.\n\nThen, [Co(SCN)_2]=40 *0.004225 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.004225 *0.01=40 *0.00004225=0.00169 M.\n\nSo the fraction is 0.00169 /0.01 =0.169, 16.9%.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option D.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused because when I thought about the stepwise approach, the percentage was lower, but that approach may not be applicable here.\n\nI think the problem is expecting the first approach, where each \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. Therefore, the correct answer is D) 16.9%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.\n\nSo, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) are given for four complexes: \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.\n\nWait, blue dithiocyanato... I think that refers to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is blue. But wait, no, wait. Let me think. Cobalt complexes with different SCN- ligands can have different colors. The blue one is usually the tetrathiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)_4]^2\u2212, which is blue. Oh wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, I think the blue one is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or is it [Co(SCN)_4]^2\u2212? I remember that [Co(SCN)_4]^2\u2212 is blue, and [Co(SCN)_3]^\u2212 is maybe another color. Hmm, but the question refers to the blue dithiocyanato, which would be two SCN- groups. So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So that would be the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} species. So I need to find what fraction of all the cobalt species is in this form.\n\nThe stability constants are \u03b21 to \u03b24. Stability constant, \u03b2, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For example, \u03b21 would be for [Co(SCN)]+ since it's the first complex. Wait, how do the complexes form? Let me think. The general formation would be:\n\nCo\u00b2+ + n SCN^- \u21cc [Co(SCN)_n]^{2\u2212n}\n\nSo for each n, the complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2\u2212n}.\n\nThe stability constant \u03b2n is given by:\n\n\u03b2n = [ [Co(SCN)_n^{2\u2212n} ] ] / ( [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n )\n\nSo for each n, the complex is formed stepwise, with each \u03b2n being the equilibrium for adding the nth SCN^-.\n\nWait, but wait, the way these \u03b2 values are given, are they for each step or for the overall formation? Like, \u03b21 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, \u03b22 would be for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, \u03b23 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and \u03b24 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2\u2212}.\n\nSo, each \u03b2n is the equilibrium constant for the nth step.\n\nSo, the overall formation constants for each complex can be found by multiplying the previous \u03b2's. Or wait, perhaps each \u03b2n is the cumulative constant for the complex up to n SCN ligands. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, the problem says \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16.\" So each \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So, \u03b21 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, \u03b22 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, \u03b23 for [Co(SCN)_3]^\u2212, and \u03b24 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2\u2212}.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because \u03b24 is 16, which is lower than \u03b23. Usually, the stability constants increase with the number of ligands, but maybe in this case, it's not. So, the complexes form up to four SCN ligands, but the \u03b24 is lower. Hmm.\n\nWait, I think perhaps I got the way the stability constants are defined wrong. Maybe each \u03b2n is the stepwise formation constant for adding the nth ligand. So, \u03b21 is K1 = [CoSCN+]/( [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-] ), \u03b22 is K2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/( [CoSCN+][SCN^-] ), and so on. Then, the overall \u03b2 for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of K1*K2*...*Kn.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if that's the case, then the overall \u03b2 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2\u2212} would be \u03b21 * \u03b22 * \u03b23 * \u03b24. But wait, in the problem statement, the \u03b2's are given as 9,40,63,16. So, the overall \u03b2 for each complex would be the product of the \u03b2's up to that point.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says \"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16.\" So, perhaps each \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN ligands. So, \u03b21=9 is for [CoSCN]+, \u03b22=40 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, \u03b23=63 for [Co(SCN)_3]^\u2212, and \u03b24=16 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2\u2212}.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the stability constant decreases for n=4 compared to n=3, which is a bit odd, but maybe possible.\n\nHmm, but then, in that case, how do we proceed? Because the problem is asking about the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, I think. So its stability constant is \u03b22=40.\n\nWait, but in any case, the solution will involve finding the fraction of each cobalt species (from n=0 to n=4) and then summing the fractions of the desired species.\n\nSo, the approach is to model the distribution of Co(II) among the different complexes. Each complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, where n can be 0 (free Co\u00b2+), 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nThe fraction of each species can be found using the stability constants and the concentrations of Co\u00b2+ and SCN^-.\n\nWait, but the total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So, the sum of all species [Co\u00b2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^- ] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}] = 1e-2 M.\n\nSimilarly, the SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M, but some of it is tied up in the complexes. So, the total SCN is [SCN^-] + 4*[Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}] + 3*[Co(SCN)_3^- ] + 2*[Co(SCN)_2] + 1*[CoSCN+] = 0.1 M. But since the SCN concentration is much higher (0.1 M is 1e-1, and the Co is 1e-2), the free SCN^- is much higher than the bound, so perhaps it's a good approximation to consider [SCN^-] as approximately 0.1 M, especially since the problem doesn't give any other info.\n\nWait, but maybe we should not make that approximation because the amount of SCN bound could be significant? Let's think. The total Co is 0.01 M, and each Co can bind up to 4 SCN. So maximum SCN consumed is 0.01 *4=0.04 M. But the initial SCN is 0.1 M, so the free SCN would be 0.1 - 0.04 =0.06 M. So, it's about 60% less. So, maybe the free SCN can't be approximated as 0.1. Hmm, but 0.06 is still higher than 0.04, so perhaps the approximation is okay, but maybe not. But perhaps the problem expects us to use the given [SCN^-] as 0.1 M, ignoring any binding effect. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it without the approximation.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think: in such cases, the solution is often to assume that the free [SCN^-] is approximately 0.1 M, because the amount bound is small compared to the initial concentration. So, perhaps in this problem, that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants us to calculate the exact [SCN^-], but that would complicate things. Let's proceed under the assumption that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and see where that gets us. If the approximation is wrong, the answer might be off, but perhaps it's what's intended.\n\nSo, the idea is to calculate the fraction of each Co species, then sum the fractions of the desired species (the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the n=2 species) relative to the total.\n\nTo find the fractions, we can use the stability constants and the concentrations. The general approach is to use the formation equations and the stability constants to express the concentration of each species in terms of the free Co\u00b2+ concentration.\n\nLet me denote [Co\u00b2+] as x. Then, each complex can be expressed as:\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 * x * [SCN^-]\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 * x * [SCN^-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^- ] = \u03b23 * x * [SCN^-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}] = \u03b24 * x * [SCN^-]^4\n\nWait, no. Wait, the overall stability constant for each complex is the product of the stepwise \u03b2's up to that point. So, for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, the \u03b2 is \u03b21 * \u03b22 * ... * \u03b2n.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the \u03b2's given are for each complex. For example, \u03b21 is the stability constant for [CoSCN+] (n=1), \u03b22 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), etc. So perhaps each \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands.\n\nSo, for [CoSCN+], \u03b21=9, so [CoSCN+] = \u03b21 * [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]\n\nSimilarly, [Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 * [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^2\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the concentrations of each complex are:\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 * x * [SCN^-]\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 * x * [SCN^-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^- ] = \u03b23 * x * [SCN^-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}] = \u03b24 * x * [SCN^-]^4\n\nWhere x is [Co\u00b2+], the free cobalt ion concentration.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is:\n\nx + \u03b21 x [SCN^-] + \u03b22 x [SCN^-]^2 + \u03b23 x [SCN^-]^3 + \u03b24 x [SCN^-]^4 = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.\n\nWe can factor out x:\n\nx [1 + \u03b21 [SCN^-] + \u03b22 [SCN^-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN^-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN^-]^4 ] = 1e-2.\n\nWe can solve for x.\n\nGiven that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, let's compute each term.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n\u03b21 [SCN^-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\n\u03b22 [SCN^-]^2 =40 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01=0.4\n\n\u03b23 [SCN^-]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063\n\n\u03b24 [SCN^-]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016\n\nNow sum these:\n\n1 (from the x term) + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1 + 0.9=1.9; 1.9+0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.\n\nSo the denominator becomes 2.3646.\n\nThen,\n\nx = (1e-2) / 2.3646 \u2248 0.004225 M.\n\nWait, let me compute 1e-2 / 2.3646.\n\n1e-2 is 0.01. 0.01 divided by 2.3646.\n\nLet me compute 0.01 / 2.3646. Let me approximate 2.3646 \u22482.365. 0.01 /2.365 \u22480.004225.\n\nSo x \u2248 0.004225 M.\n\nNow, the concentrations of each complex are:\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 x [SCN^-] =9 *0.004225 *0.1 = 9 *0.0004225=0.0038025 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b22 x [SCN^-]^2=40 *0.004225 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.004225 *0.01=40 * 0.00004225=0.00169 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^- ] =63 *0.004225 * (0.1)^3=63 *0.004225 *0.001=63 *4.225e-6= approx 2.66e-4 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}] =16 *0.004225 * (0.1)^4=16 *0.004225 *0.0001=16 *4.225e-8=6.76e-7 M.\n\nNow, let's sum all these concentrations plus x to see if they add up to 0.01 M.\n\nx =0.004225\n\n[CoSCN+] =0.0038025\n\n[Co(SCN)_2]=0.00169\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^- ]=0.000000266 (approx 2.66e-4)\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}]=6.76e-7\n\nAdding them up:\n\n0.004225 +0.0038025 = 0.0080275\n\n+0.00169 = 0.0097175\n\n+0.000266 =0.0099835\n\n+0.000000676 \u22480.009984176.\n\nWait, but the total should be 0.01 M. Hmm, seems like it's about 0.009984, which is close to 0.01, so perhaps the approximation is acceptable, considering rounding errors.\n\nNow, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. The concentration of this is 0.00169 M.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. So the fraction is 0.00169 / 0.01 = 0.169, or 16.9%.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, because the question says \"the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes,\" which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the calculations.\n\nx was found as 0.004225 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] is 40 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^2.\n\n(0.1)^2 is 0.01.\n\nSo 40 *0.004225 =0.169.\n\n0.169 *0.01=0.00169 M.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the fraction is (0.00169)/(0.01) =0.169, 16.9%.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 16.9%, so that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem gave \u03b24 as 16, which is lower than \u03b23=63. So the formation of higher complexes may not be as favored. So the majority might be in lower n complexes. But according to our calculation, [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.9%, which is about 17%, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that each \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. Because in reality, the \u03b2n could be the stepwise constants, and the overall \u03b2 for each complex is the product of the previous \u03b2's.\n\nWait, that's a critical point. Let me think again.\n\nIf \u03b21 is the first stepwise constant, \u03b22 is the second, etc., then the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of \u03b21 to \u03b2n.\n\nSo, for example, [Co(SCN)_2] would have an overall \u03b2 of \u03b21 * \u03b22.\n\nIn that case, the concentrations would be:\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 x [SCN^-]\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b21 \u03b22 x [SCN^-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^- ] = \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 x [SCN^-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}] = \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 x [SCN^-]^4\n\nAh, this is a different approach. So the earlier approach I took may have been incorrect because I assumed each \u03b2n was the overall for n ligands, but perhaps they are the stepwise.\n\nSo, if that's the case, the overall \u03b2 for each complex would be the product of the stepwise \u03b2's up to n.\n\nSo, let's reevaluate.\n\nIn that case, the concentrations are:\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 x [SCN^-]\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b21 \u03b22 x [SCN^-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^- ] = \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 x [SCN^-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212}] = \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 x [SCN^-]^4\n\nSo, the denominator in the equation would be:\n\nx [1 + \u03b21 [SCN^-] + \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN^-]^2 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [SCN^-]^3 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [SCN^-]^4 ] = c(Co) =1e-2 M.\n\nSo, let's compute each term with this approach.\n\nGiven \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\nCompute each term inside the brackets:\n\nTerm 0: 1\n\nTerm1: \u03b21 [SCN^-] =9 *0.1=0.9\n\nTerm2: \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN^-]^2=9 *40 * (0.1)^2= 360 * 0.01=3.6\n\nTerm3: \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [SCN^-]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) *0.001=22.68\n\nTerm4: \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [SCN^-]^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4= let's compute 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880. Multiply by (0.1)^4=0.0001. So 362880 *0.0001=36.288.\n\nWait, so the terms are:\n\nTerm0:1\n\nTerm1:0.9\n\nTerm2:3.6\n\nTerm3:22.68\n\nTerm4:36.288\n\nSo, sum all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.\n\nSo denominator is 64.468.\n\nSo, x = (1e-2)/64.468 \u2248 0.00015516 M.\n\nWait, wait, 1e-2 is 0.01. 0.01 /64.468 \u2248 0.00015516 M.\n\nSo x \u22481.5516e-4 M.\n\nNow, compute the concentrations of each complex.\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 x [SCN^-] =9 * 1.5516e-4 * 0.1 =9 * 1.5516e-5 =1.3964e-4 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2] = \u03b21 \u03b22 x [SCN^-]^2 =9*40 *1.5516e-4 * (0.1)^2=360 *1.5516e-4 *0.01=360 *1.5516e-6=5.5858e-4 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_3^- ]= \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 x [SCN^-]^3=9*40*63 *1.5516e-4 * (0.1)^3= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) *1.5516e-4 *0.001=22680 *1.5516e-7= approx 22680 *1.5516e-7.\n\nWait, 22680 *1.5516e-7 = (22680) * 1.5516e-7.\n\nLet me compute 22680 *1.5516e-7.\n\n22680 is 2.268e4. 2.268e4 *1.5516e-7 = 2.268 *1.5516 * 1e-3 = (approx 3.516) * 1e-3 =0.003516 M.\n\nWait, but wait, let me compute that again.\n\nWait, 22680 *1.5516e-4 (since x is 1.5516e-4, [SCN^-]^3 is (0.1)^3=1e-3, so [SCN^-]^3=1e-3.\n\nWait, no: [Co(SCN)_3^- ] = \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 x [SCN^-]^3.\n\nSo, the calculation is:\n\n9 *40 *63 = 22680.\n\n22680 * x =22680 * 1.5516e-4 = approx 22680 * 0.00015516 \u22483.516.\n\nThen multiply by [SCN^-]^3, which is (0.1)^3=0.001.\n\nSo 3.516 *0.001 =0.003516 M.\n\nWait, that seems high.\n\nSimilarly, [Co(SCN)_4^{2\u2212} ] = \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 x [SCN^-]^4=9*40*63*16 *x * (0.1)^4.\n\n9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880.\n\nx=1.5516e-4, [SCN^-]^4= (0.1)^4=1e-4.\n\nSo,\n\n362880 *1.5516e-4 *1e-4 =362880 *1.5516e-8.\n\nCompute 362880 *1.5516e-8.\n\n362880 \u22483.6288e5.\n\n3.6288e5 *1.5516e-8 = (3.6288 *1.5516) * 1e-3.\n\n3.6288 *1.5516 \u2248approx 5.62 (exact: 3.6288 *1.5516 = let's compute:\n\n3 *1.5516=4.6548\n\n0.6288 *1.5516= approx 0.6288*1.5=0.9432; 0.6288*0.0516\u22480.0325. So total approx 0.9757.\n\nSo total is 4.6548 +0.9757=5.6305.\n\nSo 5.6305e-3 M.

The options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding what the \u03b2's are. Because in the first approach, where each \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for n ligands, the percentage was 16.9%, which is option D. But in the second approach, where \u03b2n are stepwise constants, the percentage is about 5.5%, which is not an option.\n\nSo, the problem must be in the initial assumption about the \u03b2n.\n\nWait, the problem states, \"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16.\" So, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Are these the overall constants for each complex, or the stepwise constants for each addition?\n\nIn the context of stability constants, when someone says the stability constants of the complexes, they usually refer to the overall constants. So, each \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands.\n\nIn that case, the first approach is correct, and the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, in the first approach, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00169 M, which is 16.9% of 0.01 M. So that's option D.\n\nSo why in the second approach, where \u03b2n are stepwise, the percentage is much lower and doesn't match any option?\n\nI think the problem statement is using the \u03b2n as the overall stability constants for the complex with n ligands. So, the first approach is correct, leading to option D.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: perhaps the complexes have different charges, and the [SCN^-] concentrations in their expressions are different.\n\nWait, the general expression for each complex is:\n\n[Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+][SCN^-]^n.\n\nSo, yes, that's the correct way.\n\nSo, in the first approach, the calculation leads to 16.9% for [Co(SCN)_2], which is option D.\n\nBut why in the second approach, the percentage is lower? Because that approach assumes the \u03b2n are stepwise, leading to a much higher concentration in higher n complexes.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects the first approach, because in the first approach, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nBut let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 42.3%\n\nB) 25.6%\n\nC) 38.1%\n\nD) 16.9%\n\nSo, option D is 16.9%.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check the first approach's calculations.\n\nIn the first approach, the denominator was 2.3646, leading to x=0.004225.\n\nThen, [Co(SCN)_2]=40 *0.004225 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.004225 *0.01=40 *0.00004225=0.00169 M.\n\nSo the fraction is 0.00169 /0.01 =0.169, 16.9%.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option D.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused because when I thought about the stepwise approach, the percentage was lower, but that approach may not be applicable here.\n\nI think the problem is expecting the first approach, where each \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. Therefore, the correct answer is D) 16.9%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants and concentrations. The stability constants provided are for the overall complexes:  \n- \u03b21 = 9 (for [CoSCN]^+),  \n- \u03b22 = 40 (for [Co(SCN)_2]^0),  \n- \u03b23 = 63 (for [Co(SCN)_3]^-),  \n- \u03b24 = 16 (for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}).  \n\nThe total cobalt concentration is given as \\( c(\\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \\, \\text{M} \\), and the thiocyanate concentration is \\( [\\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\). The goal is to calculate the fraction of cobalt in the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex.\n\n### Key Equations and Approach:\n1. The concentration of each cobalt complex is expressed using the stability constants:  \n   \\[\n   [\\text{Co(SCN)_n}] = \\beta_n [\\text{Co}^{2+}] [\\text{SCN}^-]^n\n   \\]\n   where \\( [\\text{Co}^{2+}] \\) is the free cobalt ion concentration, denoted as \\( x \\).\n\n2. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:  \n   \\[\n   x + \\beta_1 x [\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 x [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 x [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 x [\\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 10^{-2}.\n   \\]\n\n3. Factoring out \\( x \\), we solve for \\( x \\):  \n   \\[\n   x \\left( 1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4 \\right) = 10^{-2}.\n   \\]\n\n### Calculations:\n1. Compute each term in the denominator:  \n   - \\( \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \\cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \\),  \n   - \\( \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \\cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \\),  \n   - \\( \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \\cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \\),  \n   - \\( \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \\cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \\).\n\n   Summing these:  \n   \\[\n   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.\n   \\]\n\n2. Solve for \\( x \\):  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \\approx 0.004225 \\, \\text{M}.\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0:  \n   \\[\n   [\\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = \\beta_2 x [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \\cdot 0.004225 \\cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.00169 \\, \\text{M}.\n   \\]\n\n4. Determine the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{[\\text{Co(SCN)_2}]}{c(\\text{Co})} = \\frac{0.00169}{0.01} = 0.169 \\, \\text{or} \\, 16.9\\%.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.\n\nAnswer: D",
