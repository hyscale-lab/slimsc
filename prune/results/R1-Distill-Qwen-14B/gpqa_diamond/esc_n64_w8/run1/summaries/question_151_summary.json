      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about calculating the probability of measuring a certain value for an observable. Alright, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by operators, and the state of the system is a vector. The probability is found using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator, right?\n\nSo the state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a three-component vector. So it's a 3-dimensional state vector. I think I need to normalize this vector first because probabilities require the state to be a unit vector. Oh wait, the state vector might already be normalized. Let me check.\n\nThe state vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm would be the square root of (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2. So that's 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be each component divided by sqrt(6). But wait, in the problem statement, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Does that mean it's already normalized? No, because sqrt(6) isn't 1. So I guess the state vector is not normalized. Hmm, but wait, when calculating probabilities, sometimes the state is given without being normalized, but I think in this case, I should normalize it. Because the observable's expectation is calculated based on the normalized state. Wait, or maybe the problem assumes it's already normalized. Wait, but the options don't seem to match sqrt(6) anywhere. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe observable is represented by matrix P. The matrix has three rows. First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. So P is a 3x3 matrix.\n\nI think I need to find the eigenvalues of P because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues. Then, the probability of getting a specific eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the eigenvector component corresponding to that eigenvalue when projected onto the state vector.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe P is a projection operator. Because looking at the structure, each element in P seems to be 0 except for some 1/sqrt(2) terms. Let me think. If P is a projection operator, then it should satisfy P^2 = P. Let me check that quickly.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P first. Because the observable's possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the inner product of the state vector with the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the matrix P is Hermitian because observables are Hermitian. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all elements are real, P's conjugate transpose is its transpose. So, let me transpose P. The first row becomes the first column: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row becomes second column: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row becomes third column: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Wait, but the original P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nSo the transpose of P would have columns as those rows. So the first column is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Which matches row 1. Second column is 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Which matches row 2. Third column is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0, which matches row 3. So P is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So that's good because it's an observable.\n\nSo, to find the possible measurement outcomes, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's write down the matrix P:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n]\n\nHmm, finding the eigenvalues for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit involved. The characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nLet me set up the determinant:\n\n| -\u03bb      1/sqrt(2)        0       |\n|1/sqrt(2)   -\u03bb      1/sqrt(2) |\n| 0      1/sqrt(2)      -\u03bb      |\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(0) ) ] + 0 [ ... ]\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute it using expansion by minors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a pattern or simplify the matrix.\n\nWait, perhaps P is a special matrix. Let me see if it's a circulant matrix or has any symmetry that can help. Alternatively, maybe P can be written in terms of a simpler form, like perhaps a tensor product or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for eigenvectors by considering the structure of P.\n\nLet me think about possible eigenvectors. For example, let's try vectors of the form (a, 0, a). Let's see what P does to this vector.\n\nP * [a; 0; a] = [ (1/sqrt(2))*0, (1/sqrt(2))*a, ... ] Wait, let me compute each component.\n\nFirst component: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*a = 0.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the first row of P is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So the first component is 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*a = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))*a + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*a = [ (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) ] a = (2/sqrt(2)) a = sqrt(2) a.\n\nThird component: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*a = 0.\n\nSo P*(a,0,a) = (0, sqrt(2) a, 0). Which is sqrt(2) times (0, a, 0). Hmm, that's not the same as the original vector, so that might not be an eigenvector.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's look for eigenvectors where all components are equal. Let's say v = (1,1,1)^T. Let's compute P*v.\n\nP*v = [0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1, (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1, 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 ]\n\nSo first component: (1/sqrt(2)) *1 = 1/sqrt(2)\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) *1 = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)\nThird component: (1/sqrt(2)) *1 = 1/sqrt(2)\n\nSo P*v is (1/sqrt(2), sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)). Hmm, not a multiple of v, so not an eigenvector. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the matrix is symmetric, so it can be diagonalized, and its eigenvalues are real.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the trace and see. The trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of the eigenvalues is zero.\n\nThe determinant of P is the product of the eigenvalues. Hmm, but maybe that's not helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix has rank 2, so maybe one eigenvalue is zero, and the others sum to zero. Wait, let me check the rank.\n\nLooking at P, the rows are:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.\n\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.\n\nSo row 1 and row 3 are the same except for the first and third elements. Wait, no, row 1 is [0, a, 0], row 3 is [0, a, 0]. So rows 1 and 3 are the same. So the rank of P is 2, because row 2 is different. So that means the matrix has rank 2, so there's at least one zero eigenvalue.\n\nWait, no, because the rows are [0, a, 0], [a, 0, a], [0, a, 0]. So row 1 and row 3 are identical. So the rank is 2, meaning the null space is 1-dimensional, so one eigenvalue is zero.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, and two others that sum to zero because the trace is zero. So the other two eigenvalues would be \u03bb and -\u03bb.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's a clue. So the eigenvalues are 0, \u03bb, -\u03bb.\n\nNow, let me try to find \u03bb.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a symmetric eigenvector, say v = (1, 0, -1). Let's try that.\n\nCompute P*v:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = (1/sqrt(2) - 1/sqrt(2)) )= 0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSo P*v is zero vector, so v is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0. So that's one eigenvalue, 0.\n\nSo the remaining eigenvalues are \u03bb and -\u03bb. Let's find them.\n\nSince the trace is zero, \u03bb + (-\u03bb) + 0 = 0, which holds.\n\nNow, to find \u03bb, perhaps another approach. Let me consider an eigenvector that's orthogonal to (1,0,-1), because that's the eigenvector we found for zero. Let's pick a vector like (1,1,-1) and see.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to find the eigenvalues by considering the system of equations.\n\nSo, for the matrix P, the equation (P - \u03bb I) v = 0.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can guess that the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. Wait, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero eigenvalues are 1 and -1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by considering the possible eigenvectors.\n\nWait, let's suppose that another eigenvector is (1, 1, 1). Let me compute P*(1,1,1).\n\nFirst component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 = 1/sqrt(2).\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).\n\nThird component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 = 1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo P*(1,1,1) = (1/sqrt(2), sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).\n\nHmm, not a scalar multiple of (1,1,1), so not an eigenvector.\n\nWait, maybe another vector. Let me try (1, -1, 1). Let's compute P*(1,-1,1).\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*1 = -1/sqrt(2).\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*(-1) + (1/sqrt(2))*1 = (1 + 1)/sqrt(2) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*1 = -1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the result is (-1/sqrt(2), sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nHmm, not a multiple of (1,-1,1). So that's not an eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenvectors have some symmetry. Let's think about possible eigenvectors where the first and third components are the same. Let's say v = (a, b, a).\n\nSo when we apply P, what happens?\n\nP*v is:\n\nFirst component: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))*b + 0*a = b/sqrt(2).\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))*a + 0*b + (1/sqrt(2))*a = (2a)/sqrt(2) = a*sqrt(2).\n\nThird component: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))*b + 0*a = b/sqrt(2).\n\nSo P*v = [ b/sqrt(2), a*sqrt(2), b/sqrt(2) ].\n\nWe want this to be equal to \u03bb * v = \u03bb*(a, b, a).\n\nSo, setting up equations:\n\nb/sqrt(2) = \u03bb a  ...(1)\n\na*sqrt(2) = \u03bb b  ...(2)\n\nb/sqrt(2) = \u03bb a  ...(3)\n\nFrom equation (1) and (3), they are the same, so no new info. Let's look at equations (1) and (2):\n\nFrom (1): b = \u03bb a * sqrt(2)\n\nSubstitute into equation (2):\n\na * sqrt(2) = \u03bb * (\u03bb a sqrt(2)) )\n\nSo a sqrt(2) = \u03bb^2 a sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2) is a constant here.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should factor out a:\n\nAssuming a \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by a:\n\nsqrt(2) = \u03bb^2 * sqrt(2) * (something?)\n\nWait, let me compute equation (2) with substitution of b from equation (1).\n\nEquation (2): a sqrt(2) = \u03bb b = \u03bb (\u03bb a sqrt(2)) )\n\nSo,\n\na sqrt(2) = \u03bb^2 a sqrt(2) )\n\nDivide both sides by a sqrt(2) (assuming a \u22600):\n\n1 = \u03bb^2.\n\nSo \u03bb^2 =1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo two possibilities.\n\nCase 1: \u03bb=1.\n\nThen from equation (1): b = (1) a * sqrt(2) \u2192 b = a sqrt(2).\n\nSo the eigenvector is (a, a sqrt(2), a) = a (1, sqrt(2), 1).\n\nWe can choose a=1 for simplicity, so v = (1, sqrt(2), 1).\n\nCase 2: \u03bb =-1.\n\nFrom equation (1): b = (-1) a * sqrt(2) \u2192 b= -a sqrt(2).\n\nSo the eigenvector is (a, -a sqrt(2), a ) = a (1, -sqrt(2), 1).\n\nSo we have two eigenvectors for \u03bb=1 and \u03bb=-1, and one for \u03bb=0.\n\nWait, but earlier we found that (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nNow, let's check if these eigenvectors are correct.\n\nFor \u03bb=1, v=(1, sqrt(2), 1).\n\nCompute P*v:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) + 0*1 = (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) )= 1.\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2)) *1 + 0*sqrt(2) + (1/sqrt(2)) *1 = (2/sqrt(2)) )= sqrt(2).\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) + 0*1 = 1.\n\nSo P*v = (1, sqrt(2), 1) = 1 * v. So yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly for \u03bb=-1, v=(1, -sqrt(2),1).\n\nCompute P*v:\n\nFirst component: (1/sqrt(2))*(-sqrt(2)) )= -1.\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*(-sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))*1 = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).\n\nWait, wait, that can't be. Because if v is (1, -sqrt(2), 1), then P*v should be -1 * v.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-sqrt(2)) + 0*1 = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-sqrt(2)) )= -1.\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*(-sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))*1 = (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) )= 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).\n\nWait, that would mean P*v = (-1, sqrt(2), -1). But v is (1, -sqrt(2), 1). So for \u03bb=-1, P*v = (-1, sqrt(2), -1) = -1*(1, -sqrt(2),1 ) = -v. So that's correct. Because (-1)*v would be (-1, sqrt(2), -1), which matches P*v.\n\nWait, so that's correct. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. The sum of eigenvalues is 0, which matches 1 + (-1) + 0 =0. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the probability of measuring 0. So the eigenvalue 0 corresponds to the eigenvector (1, 0, -1), as I found earlier.\n\nWait, earlier when I checked v=(1,0,-1), P*v was zero. So yes, eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo the next step is to find the projection of the given state onto this eigenvector.\n\nBut wait, the state vector is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. But I need to normalize it first because the state vector must be a unit vector for probabilities to sum to 1.\n\nWait, the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nNow, the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is v = (1, 0, -1)^T. But we can normalize this as well. The norm of v is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is u = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.\n\nThe probability P is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |\u03c8> and u.\n\nSo compute <\u03c8 | u> = (-1/sqrt(6))(1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6))(0) + (1/sqrt(6))(-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) )= -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )= -1/sqrt(12) )= -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSecond term: 0.\n\nThird term: (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) )= -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )= -1/sqrt(12) )= -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSo sum: (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) + 0 + (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) )= -2/(2 sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value is 1/sqrt(3), and the square is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1/3.\n",

Let's see what P does to this vector.\n\nP * [a; 0; a] = [ (1/sqrt(2))*0, (1/sqrt(2))*a, ... ] Wait, let me compute each component.\n\nFirst component: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*a = 0.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the first row of P is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So the first component is 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*a = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))*a + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*a = [ (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) ] a = (2/sqrt(2)) a = sqrt(2) a.\n\nThird component: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*a = 0.\n\nSo P*(a,0,a) = (0, sqrt(2) a, 0). Which is sqrt(2) times (0, a, 0). Hmm, that's not the same as the original vector, so that might not be an eigenvector.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's look for eigenvectors where all components are equal. Let's say v = (1,1,1)^T. Let's compute P*v.\n\nP*v = [0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1, (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1, 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 ]\n\nSo first component: (1/sqrt(2)) *1 = 1/sqrt(2)\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) *1 = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)\nThird component: (1/sqrt(2)) *1 = 1/sqrt(2)\n\nSo P*v is (1/sqrt(2), sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)). Hmm, not a multiple of v, so not an eigenvector. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the matrix is symmetric, so it can be diagonalized, and its eigenvalues are real.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the trace and see. The trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of the eigenvalues is zero.\n\nThe determinant of P is the product of the eigenvalues. Hmm, but maybe that's not helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix has rank 2, so maybe one eigenvalue is zero, and the others sum to zero. Wait, let me check the rank.\n\nLooking at P, the rows are:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.\n\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.\n\nSo row 1 and row 3 are the same except for the first and third elements. Wait, no, row 1 is [0, a, 0], row 3 is [0, a, 0]. So rows 1 and 3 are the same. So the rank of P is 2, because row 2 is different. So that means the matrix has rank 2, so there's at least one zero eigenvalue.\n\nWait, no, because the rows are [0, a, 0], [a, 0, a], [0, a, 0]. So row 1 and row 3 are identical. So the rank is 2, meaning the null space is 1-dimensional, so one eigenvalue is zero.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, and two others that sum to zero because the trace is zero. So the other two eigenvalues would be \u03bb and -\u03bb.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's a clue. So the eigenvalues are 0, \u03bb, -\u03bb.\n\nNow, let me try to find \u03bb.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a symmetric eigenvector, say v = (1, 0, -1). Let's try that.\n\nCompute P*v:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = (1/sqrt(2) - 1/sqrt(2)) )= 0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSo P*v is zero vector, so v is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0. So that's one eigenvalue, 0.\n\nSo the remaining eigenvalues are \u03bb and -\u03bb. Let's find them.\n\nSince the trace is zero, \u03bb + (-\u03bb) + 0 = 0, which holds.\n\nNow, to find \u03bb, perhaps another approach. Let me consider an eigenvector that's orthogonal to (1,0,-1), because that's the eigenvector we found for zero. Let's pick a vector like (1,1,-1) and see.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to find the eigenvalues by considering the system of equations.\n\nSo, for the matrix P, the equation (P - \u03bb I) v = 0.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can guess that the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. Wait, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero eigenvalues are 1 and -1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by considering the possible eigenvectors.\n\nWait, let's suppose that another eigenvector is (1, 1, 1). Let me compute P*(1,1,1).\n\nFirst component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 = 1/sqrt(2).\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).\n\nThird component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 = 1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo P*(1,1,1) = (1/sqrt(2), sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).\n\nHmm, not a scalar multiple of (1,1,1), so not an eigenvector.\n\nWait, maybe another vector. Let me try (1, -1, 1). Let's compute P*(1,-1,1).\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*1 = -1/sqrt(2).\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*(-1) + (1/sqrt(2))*1 = (1 + 1)/sqrt(2) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*1 = -1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the result is (-1/sqrt(2), sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nHmm, not a multiple of (1,-1,1). So that's not an eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenvectors have some symmetry. Let's think about possible eigenvectors where the first and third components are the same. Let's say v = (a, b, a).\n\nSo when we apply P, what happens?\n\nP*v is:\n\nFirst component: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))*b + 0*a = b/sqrt(2).\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))*a + 0*b + (1/sqrt(2))*a = (2a)/sqrt(2) = a*sqrt(2).\n\nThird component: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))*b + 0*a = b/sqrt(2).\n\nSo P*v = [ b/sqrt(2), a*sqrt(2), b/sqrt(2) ].\n\nWe want this to be equal to \u03bb * v = \u03bb*(a, b, a).\n\nSo, setting up equations:\n\nb/sqrt(2) = \u03bb a  ...(1)\n\na*sqrt(2) = \u03bb b  ...(2)\n\nb/sqrt(2) = \u03bb a  ...(3)\n\nFrom equation (1) and (3), they are the same, so no new info. Let's look at equations (1) and (2):\n\nFrom (1): b = \u03bb a * sqrt(2)\n\nSubstitute into equation (2):\n\na * sqrt(2) = \u03bb * (\u03bb a sqrt(2)) )\n\nSo a sqrt(2) = \u03bb^2 a sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2) is a constant here.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should factor out a:\n\nAssuming a \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by a:\n\nsqrt(2) = \u03bb^2 * sqrt(2) * (something?)\n\nWait, let me compute equation (2) with substitution of b from equation (1).\n\nEquation (2): a sqrt(2) = \u03bb b = \u03bb (\u03bb a sqrt(2)) )\n\nSo,\n\na sqrt(2) = \u03bb^2 a sqrt(2) )\n\nDivide both sides by a sqrt(2) (assuming a \u22600):\n\n1 = \u03bb^2.\n\nSo \u03bb^2 =1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo two possibilities.\n\nCase 1: \u03bb=1.\n\nThen from equation (1): b = (1) a * sqrt(2) \u2192 b = a sqrt(2).\n\nSo the eigenvector is (a, a sqrt(2), a) = a (1, sqrt(2), 1).\n\nWe can choose a=1 for simplicity, so v = (1, sqrt(2), 1).\n\nCase 2: \u03bb =-1.\n\nFrom equation (1): b = (-1) a * sqrt(2) \u2192 b= -a sqrt(2).\n\nSo the eigenvector is (a, -a sqrt(2), a ) = a (1, -sqrt(2), 1).\n\nSo we have two eigenvectors for \u03bb=1 and \u03bb=-1, and one for \u03bb=0.\n\nWait, but earlier we found that (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nNow, let's check if these eigenvectors are correct.\n\nFor \u03bb=1, v=(1, sqrt(2), 1).\n\nCompute P*v:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) + 0*1 = (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) )= 1.\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2)) *1 + 0*sqrt(2) + (1/sqrt(2)) *1 = (2/sqrt(2)) )= sqrt(2).\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) + 0*1 = 1.\n\nSo P*v = (1, sqrt(2), 1) = 1 * v. So yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly for \u03bb=-1, v=(1, -sqrt(2),1).\n\nCompute P*v:\n\nFirst component: (1/sqrt(2))*(-sqrt(2)) )= -1.\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*(-sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))*1 = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).\n\nWait, wait, that can't be. Because if v is (1, -sqrt(2), 1), then P*v should be -1 * v.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-sqrt(2)) + 0*1 = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-sqrt(2)) )= -1.\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*(-sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))*1 = (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) )= 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).\n\nWait, that would mean P*v = (-1, sqrt(2), -1). But v is (1, -sqrt(2), 1). So for \u03bb=-1, P*v = (-1, sqrt(2), -1) = -1*(1, -sqrt(2),1 ) = -v. So that's correct. Because (-1)*v would be (-1, sqrt(2), -1), which matches P*v.\n\nWait, so that's correct. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. The sum of eigenvalues is 0, which matches 1 + (-1) + 0 =0. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the probability of measuring 0. So the eigenvalue 0 corresponds to the eigenvector (1, 0, -1), as I found earlier.\n\nWait, earlier when I checked v=(1,0,-1), P*v was zero. So yes, eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo the next step is to find the projection of the given state onto this eigenvector.\n\nBut wait, the state vector is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. But I need to normalize it first because the state vector must be a unit vector for probabilities to sum to 1.\n\nWait, the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nNow, the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is v = (1, 0, -1)^T. But we can normalize this as well. The norm of v is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is u = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.\n\nThe probability P is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |\u03c8> and u.\n\nSo compute <\u03c8 | u> = (-1/sqrt(6))(1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6))(0) + (1/sqrt(6))(-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) )= -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )= -1/sqrt(12) )= -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSecond term: 0.\n\nThird term: (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) )= -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )= -1/sqrt(12) )= -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSo sum: (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) + 0 + (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) )= -2/(2 sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value is 1/sqrt(3), and the square is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1/3.\n\n\nTo calculate the probability of measuring 0 for the given observable, we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the state vector\nThe state vector is given as \\( \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\). Its norm is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the normalized state vector is:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the observable matrix \\( P \\)\nThe observable \\( P \\) is given as:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThis matrix is symmetric, hence Hermitian, ensuring real eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of \\( P \\) are found to be \\( 1, -1, \\) and \\( 0 \\) through symmetry and direct computation. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \\( 0 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nv_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nNormalizing \\( v_0 \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nu_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the probability of measuring 0\nThe probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) onto \\( u_0 \\). The inner product is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi | u_0 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nCompute each term:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi | u_0 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}} \\left[ (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}} \\left[ -1 + 0 - 1 \\right] = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\nThe absolute value is:\n\n\\[\n|\\langle \\psi | u_0 \\rangle| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}},\n\\]\n\nand the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(0) = \\left| \\langle \\psi | u_0 \\rangle \\right|^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe probability of measuring 0 is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it again. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait. Wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized, right? So I should check if this vector is normalized first. Because if it's not, I might have to normalize it before proceeding.\n\nThe observable is represented by matrix P. The matrix P has elements in the first row as 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row is 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. So it's a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that down.\n\nThe question is to find the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 at time t. So, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the matrix P. And the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state vector.\n\nWait, but first I need to make sure the state is a unit vector. So the given state vector is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Let's compute its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Because when we take the inner product, we have to have a unit vector.\n\nSo the actual state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nNext, the observable P is given. So P is the matrix:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nWait, let me write that correctly. So P is:\n\n[ [0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n  [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n  [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] ]\n\nHmm, interesting. So what are the eigenvalues of this matrix? Because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P to know the possible measurement outcomes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of P in the state |\u03c8> and see if 0 is one of the possible outcomes. Wait no, because the problem is directly asking for the probability of getting 0 when measuring P.\n\nWait, another approach: in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an observable is the sum over the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. But to find the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue (like 0), we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue, and then compute the inner product squared between |\u03c8> and each eigenvector.\n\nSo first, let's find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix P has a particular structure that makes finding eigenvalues easier. Let's try to compute them.\n\nThe eigenvalues \u03bb satisfy det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P - \u03bb I is:\n\nRow 1: [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nLet's compute the determinant of this matrix.\n\nThe determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's try expansion by minors on the first row.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] ) - (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] ) + 0 * ... (since the third element is 0, that term drops out).\n\nSo first term: -\u03bb * [ ( (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) ) - (1/\u221a2 * 1/\u221a2) ) ] = -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) * ( -\u03bb / \u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a2)( \u03bb / \u221a2 ) = \u03bb / 2\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) + \u03bb/2 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0 \u2192 -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )= 0\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. Because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the first term: the minor for element (1,1) is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:\n\n[ [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ],\n  [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ] ]\n\nWhich is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nSo the first term is (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nThe second term is for element (1,2), which is 1/\u221a2, and its minor is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2:\n\n[ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2],\n  [0, -\u03bb] ]\n\nSo the determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) = -\u03bb / \u221a2.\n\nBut because in the expansion, the sign alternates as + - + for the first row.\n\nSo the sign for the (1,2) element is negative. So the second term is - (1/\u221a2) * ( -\u03bb / \u221a2 ) \u2192 which is (1/\u221a2)*(\u03bb /\u221a2 )= \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo combining the two terms:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 -1/2 ) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) \u2192 -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb (-\u03bb^2 +1 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb =0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. So the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of getting 0. So we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, and then compute the inner product squared between the state |\u03c8> and that eigenvector.\n\nSo, first, let's find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0. So we need to solve (P - 0 I) v =0 \u2192 P v =0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 (v1 + v3 ) / \u221a2 =0 \u2192 v1 +v3 =0.\n\nRow3: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as row1: v2=0.\n\nSo from row1 and row3, v2=0.\n\nFrom row2: v1 +v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are all vectors where v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. We can choose v1=1, so the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]^T. But wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, if v1=1, then v3=-1. So the vector is (1, 0, -1). Let's see if this satisfies P v =0.\n\nP is the matrix:\n\nRow1: 0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nRow2: 1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2\n\nRow3: 0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nSo P times [1;0;-1]:\n\nRow1: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-1) =0 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: (1/\u221a2)*1 +0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2)(1-1)=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow3: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-1)=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo yes, [1;0;-1] is an eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nBut wait, is that the only eigenvector? Or are there others? Because sometimes there can be multiple eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue. Let me see: the equations were v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So any vector of the form (a, 0, -a) is an eigenvector for \u03bb=0. So the eigenspace is two-dimensional? Wait, no. Because in a 3x3 matrix, the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 would be the null space of P. Let me see the rank of P.\n\nWait, P is a 3x3 matrix. Let's compute its rank. If I write P as:\n\nRow1: 0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nRow2: 1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2\n\nRow3: 0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nIf we add row1 and row3, we get row [0, 2/\u221a2, 0 ] \u2192 which is [0, sqrt(2), 0 ].\n\nHmm, but the rows might be linearly dependent. Let me check.\n\nWait, row1 and row3 are similar. Let me see:\n\nRow1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nRow3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nWait, no. Row1 and Row3 are the same. Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait no, the first row is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], the third row is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]. So rows 1 and 3 are the same. So the rank is 2 because row2 is different.\n\nWait, but if rows 1 and 3 are the same, then the rank is at most 2. Let's see if row2 can be expressed as a combination of row1 and row3. Well, row2 is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2].\n\nHmm, trying to express row2 as a combination of row1 and row3:\n\nrow2 = a*row1 + b*row3.\n\nrow1 and row3 are the same, so row2 = (a + b) row1.\n\nBut row1 is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], while row2 is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2].\n\nSo the only way this can happen is if a + b =0 for the first and third elements, but row2 has 1/\u221a2 in the first and third positions, which row1 doesn't have. So row2 is linearly independent from row1 and row3. So the rank of P is 3? Wait, no, because row1 and row3 are the same, so the rank is 2. Because row2 can't be expressed as a combination of row1 and row3.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the determinant of P. If the determinant is zero, then the matrix is singular, which implies that 0 is an eigenvalue.\n\nWait, earlier when we found the eigenvalues, 0 was one of them, so the determinant is zero. So the rank is less than 3, which it is. So the null space has dimension 1, because the rank is 2. So the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional. So the only eigenvectors are scalar multiples of [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nWait, no, because earlier when solving for the null space, we found that v2=0, and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are all vectors where v2=0 and v3=-v1. So any vector of the form (a, 0, -a) is in the null space. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). So any vector in that space can be written as a scalar multiple of that vector.\n\nSo the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is any vector of the form (a, 0, -a), so the normalized eigenvector would be (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T. Because the norm squared is 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2=2 \u2192 norm is sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but when we have eigenvectors, they can be any scalar multiple, so for the purpose of computing probabilities, we can take the normalized eigenvector. So the normalized eigenvector |v> for \u03bb=0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nSo now, the state |\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nWe need to find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0. This is the square of the amplitude of the component of |\u03c8> in the direction of |v>.\n\nThe amplitude is the inner product <v | \u03c8>.\n\nSo let's compute <v | \u03c8>.\n\nFirst, |v> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T. So <v| is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1].\n\n|\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) * [1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*(1) ].\n\nLet me compute the components:\n\n1*(-1) = -1\n\n0*2 =0\n\n-1 *1 = -1\n\nSum: -1 + 0 -1 = -2.\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(6)) ) * (-2) = (-2)/sqrt(12) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude. So | -1/sqrt(3) |^2 = (1/3).\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. Looking back at the options, option C is 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the inner product calculation.\n\nWait, the vector |v> is [1, 0, -1]^T divided by sqrt(2). The vector |\u03c8> is [-1,2,1]^T divided by sqrt(6).\n\nSo <v|\u03c8> = [1 0 -1] (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nSo [1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ] = (-1 +0 -1)= -2.\n\nMultiply by (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(6)) ) = 1/(sqrt(12)) = 1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSo <v|\u03c8> = (-2) * (1/(2 sqrt(3)) )) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), the square is (1/3).\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. So the correct answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it again. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait. Wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized, right? So I should check if this vector is normalized first. Because if it's not, I might have to normalize it before proceeding.\n\nThe observable is represented by matrix P. The matrix P has elements in the first row as 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row is 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. So it's a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that down.\n\nThe question is to find the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 at time t. So, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the matrix P. And the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state vector.\n\nWait, but first I need to make sure the state is a unit vector. So the given state vector is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Let's compute its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Because when we take the inner product, we have to have a unit vector.\n\nSo the actual state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nNext, the observable P is given. So P is the matrix:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nWait, let me write that correctly. So P is:\n\n[ [0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n  [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n  [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] ]\n\nHmm, interesting. So what are the eigenvalues of this matrix? Because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P to know the possible measurement outcomes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of P in the state |\u03c8> and see if 0 is one of the possible outcomes. Wait no, because the problem is directly asking for the probability of getting 0 when measuring P.\n\nWait, another approach: in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an observable is the sum over the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. But to find the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue (like 0), we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue, and then compute the inner product squared between |\u03c8> and each eigenvector.\n\nSo first, let's find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix P has a particular structure that makes finding eigenvalues easier. Let's try to compute them.\n\nThe eigenvalues \u03bb satisfy det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P - \u03bb I is:\n\nRow 1: [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nLet's compute the determinant of this matrix.\n\nThe determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's try expansion by minors on the first row.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] ) - (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] ) + 0 * ... (since the third element is 0, that term drops out).\n\nSo first term: -\u03bb * [ ( (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) ) - (1/\u221a2 * 1/\u221a2) ) ] = -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) * ( -\u03bb / \u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a2)( \u03bb / \u221a2 ) = \u03bb / 2\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) + \u03bb/2 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0 \u2192 -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )= 0\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. Because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the first term: the minor for element (1,1) is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:\n\n[ [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ],\n  [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ] ]\n\nWhich is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nSo the first term is (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nThe second term is for element (1,2), which is 1/\u221a2, and its minor is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2:\n\n[ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2],\n  [0, -\u03bb] ]\n\nSo the determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) = -\u03bb / \u221a2.\n\nBut because in the expansion, the sign alternates as + - + for the first row.\n\nSo the sign for the (1,2) element is negative. So the second term is - (1/\u221a2) * ( -\u03bb / \u221a2 ) \u2192 which is (1/\u221a2)*(\u03bb /\u221a2 )= \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo combining the two terms:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 -1/2 ) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) \u2192 -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb (-\u03bb^2 +1 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb =0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. So the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of getting 0. So we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, and then compute the inner product squared between the state |\u03c8> and that eigenvector.\n\nSo, first, let's find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0. So we need to solve (P - 0 I) v =0 \u2192 P v =0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 (v1 + v3 ) / \u221a2 =0 \u2192 v1 +v3 =0.\n\nRow3: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as row1: v2=0.\n\nSo from row1 and row3, v2=0.\n\nFrom row2: v1 +v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are all vectors where v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. We can choose v1=1, so the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]^T. But wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, if v1=1, then v3=-1. So the vector is (1, 0, -1). Let's see if this satisfies P v =0.\n\nP is the matrix:\n\nRow1: 0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nRow2: 1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2\n\nRow3: 0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nSo P times [1;0;-1]:\n\nRow1: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-1) =0 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow2: (1/\u221a2)*1 +0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2)(1-1)=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow3: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-1)=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo yes, [1;0;-1] is an eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nBut wait, is that the only eigenvector? Or are there others? Because sometimes there can be multiple eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue. Let me see: the equations were v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So any vector of the form (a, 0, -a) is an eigenvector for \u03bb=0. So the eigenspace is two-dimensional? Wait, no. Because in a 3x3 matrix, the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 would be the null space of P. Let me see the rank of P.\n\nWait, P is a 3x3 matrix. Let's compute its rank. If I write P as:\n\nRow1: 0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nRow2: 1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2\n\nRow3: 0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nIf we add row1 and row3, we get row [0, 2/\u221a2, 0 ] \u2192 which is [0, sqrt(2), 0 ].\n\nHmm, but the rows might be linearly dependent. Let me check.\n\nWait, row1 and row3 are similar. Let me see:\n\nRow1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nRow3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nWait, no. Row1 and Row3 are the same. Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait no, the first row is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], the third row is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]. So rows 1 and 3 are the same. So the rank is 2 because row2 is different.\n\nWait, but if rows 1 and 3 are the same, then the rank is at most 2. Let's see if row2 can be expressed as a combination of row1 and row3. Well, row2 is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2].\n\nHmm, trying to express row2 as a combination of row1 and row3:\n\nrow2 = a*row1 + b*row3.\n\nrow1 and row3 are the same, so row2 = (a + b) row1.\n\nBut row1 is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], while row2 is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2].\n\nSo the only way this can happen is if a + b =0 for the first and third elements, but row2 has 1/\u221a2 in the first and third positions, which row1 doesn't have. So row2 is linearly independent from row1 and row3. So the rank of P is 3? Wait, no, because row1 and row3 are the same, so the rank is 2. Because row2 can't be expressed as a combination of row1 and row3.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the determinant of P. If the determinant is zero, then the matrix is singular, which implies that 0 is an eigenvalue.\n\nWait, earlier when we found the eigenvalues, 0 was one of them, so the determinant is zero. So the rank is less than 3, which it is. So the null space has dimension 1, because the rank is 2. So the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional. So the only eigenvectors are scalar multiples of [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nWait, no, because earlier when solving for the null space, we found that v2=0, and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are all vectors where v2=0 and v3=-v1. So any vector of the form (a, 0, -a) is in the null space. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). So any vector in that space can be written as a scalar multiple of that vector.\n\nSo the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is any vector of the form (a, 0, -a), so the normalized eigenvector would be (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T. Because the norm squared is 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2=2 \u2192 norm is sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but when we have eigenvectors, they can be any scalar multiple, so for the purpose of computing probabilities, we can take the normalized eigenvector. So the normalized eigenvector |v> for \u03bb=0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nSo now, the state |\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nWe need to find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0. This is the square of the amplitude of the component of |\u03c8> in the direction of |v>.\n\nThe amplitude is the inner product <v | \u03c8>.\n\nSo let's compute <v | \u03c8>.\n\nFirst, |v> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T. So <v| is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1].\n\n|\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) * [1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*(1) ].\n\nLet me compute the components:\n\n1*(-1) = -1\n\n0*2 =0\n\n-1 *1 = -1\n\nSum: -1 + 0 -1 = -2.\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(6)) ) * (-2) = (-2)/sqrt(12) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude. So | -1/sqrt(3) |^2 = (1/3).\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. Looking back at the options, option C is 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the inner product calculation.\n\nWait, the vector |v> is [1, 0, -1]^T divided by sqrt(2). The vector |\u03c8> is [-1,2,1]^T divided by sqrt(6).\n\nSo <v|\u03c8> = [1 0 -1] (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nSo [1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ] = (-1 +0 -1)= -2.\n\nMultiply by (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(6)) ) = 1/(sqrt(12)) = 1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSo <v|\u03c8> = (-2) * (1/(2 sqrt(3)) )) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), the square is (1/3).\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. So the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nThe state of the system is given as the column vector \\( |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\). To proceed, the state must be normalized. The norm of the vector is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\| |\\psi\\rangle \\| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the normalized state is:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe observable \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix} \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the probability of measuring \\( P \\) to yield 0, we first determine the eigenvalues of \\( P \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait, I think in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually column vectors, right? So this must be a 3-dimensional state vector because there are three components. Let me note that down. The state vector is \u03c8 = [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, meaning their norm should be 1. Hmm, I should check that. So the norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.\n\nSo the norm squared would be (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2. That's 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That's important because probabilities are based on normalized states. So I think I need to normalize this state vector. So the normalized state would be each component divided by sqrt(6). Let me write that down.\n\n\u03c8_normalized = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nWait, but when you take the conjugate, if the components are real, it's the same. So no problem there.\n\nNext part: the observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me look at P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix.\n\nWait, so the observable is P. Observables are Hermitian, right? Because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to possible measurement outcomes. Let me check if P is Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it's equal to its conjugate transpose.\n\nLooking at P, all elements are real. So the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So the transpose of P would have the first column as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second column as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third column as (0,1/sqrt(2), 0). Comparing to P's original structure, the second row of P is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), so the second column of P's transpose would be the second row of P, which is the same as the second column of P. Hmm, wait, maybe I should write it out.\n\nWait, the original P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo the transpose of P, which is P^T, would have columns as the rows of P. So P^T's first column is [0; 1/\u221a2; 0], second column [1/\u221a2;0;1/\u221a2], third column [0;1/\u221a2;0]. Comparing to P, the original matrix, it's the same as P. Because P's first row is 0, 1/\u221a2, 0, so P^T's first column is same as P's first row. So P is equal to P^T, so it's Hermitian. Okay, good, that's correct.\n\nNow, the question is to find the probability that the measurement of P yields 0.\n\nHmm, in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P. But wait, what's the trace of P? The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. Let's compute that: 0 + 0 +0 =0. So the sum of the eigenvalues is 0.\n\nThe determinant of P might give the product of eigenvalues. Let me compute the determinant of P. Hmm, a 3x3 determinant. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P can be written in a block diagonal form or something else. Let me think. Let me write P again:\n\nRow 1: 0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by noticing some pattern.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the matrix is symmetric and has some symmetry in its eigenvectors. Alternatively, maybe the matrix can be decomposed into smaller matrices.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to find the characteristic equation: det(P - \u03bb I) =0.\n\nSo the matrix P - \u03bb I is:\n\nRow 1: -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n| -\u03bb    1/\u221a2    0    |\n\n|1/\u221a2  -\u03bb   1/\u221a2 | \n\n| 0    1/\u221a2  -\u03bb |\n\nI can compute this determinant using expansion by minors or perhaps by row operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expanding along the first row.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] \n\n- (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ]\n\n+ 0 * [ ... ] \n\nSo let's compute each term.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb * [ (\u03bb^2) - (1/2) ) ] \n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2 ) - 0 ) ] \n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb^2 - 1/2) - (1/\u221a2)( - \u03bb /\u221a2 )\n\nSimplify each part.\n\nFirst part: -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2)\n\nSecond part: (1/\u221a2)( \u03bb /\u221a2 ) = (\u03bb )/(2)\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb =0.\n\nFactor this:\n\n\u03bb ( -\u03bb^2 +1 ) = 0.\n\nSo \u03bb =0, or -\u03bb^2 +1 =0 \u2192 \u03bb^2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 or -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the probability of getting 0.\n\nSo to find the probability, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then compute the projection of the state \u03c8 onto that eigenvector.\n\nWait, but first, let's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nFor P - 0 I = P, so the matrix is:\n\nRow 1: 0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nRow 2:1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2 \n\nRow 3: 0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nWe can write the equations for the eigenvector v=(x,y,z).\n\nThe equations are:\n\n0 x + (1/\u221a2) y + 0 z = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) y =0 \u2192 y=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2)x + 0 y + (1/\u221a2) z =0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(x + z) =0 \u2192 x + z=0 \u2192 z= -x.\n\nThird equation: 0 x + (1/\u221a2)y + 0 z=0 \u2192 same as first equation, which is y=0.\n\nSo from first equation, y=0. From second, z= -x. So the eigenvectors are of the form (x, 0, -x). Let me write this as x(1, 0, -1). So the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are any scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1).\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. Because when I solve (P - 0 I)v=0, the matrix is P, so the equations are:\n\ny=0,\n\n(1/\u221a2)(x + z) =0,\n\ny=0.\n\nSo yes, y=0, and x = -z.\n\nSo any vector (x, 0, -x) is an eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). So the normalized eigenvector would be (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, let me check the norm. The vector (1,0,-1) has norm sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So normalized, it's (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, with this normalized eigenvector.\n\nSo now, to find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0, we compute the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state vector \u03c8 and the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nBut wait, wait, the state \u03c8 was given as [-1, 2, 1], but we normalized it. So \u03c8 is actually [-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)].\n\nWait, no, the state is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1), but I have to normalize it, right? Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors must be normalized. So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nThe eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is |v0> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nThe probability is |<v0 | \u03c8>|^2.\n\nSo compute the inner product <v0 | \u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSecond term: 0.\n\nThird term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSo the inner product is [ (-1/sqrt(12)) ) ] + [ (-1/sqrt(12)) ] = (-2)/sqrt(12).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) as 2*sqrt(3), so (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is | (-1/sqrt(3)) |^2 = (1/3).\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the inner product calculation.\n\nCompute each component:\n\nv0 = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\n\u03c8 = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nInner product is sum over i: v0_i * \u03c8_i.\n\nSo:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + (0)*(2/sqrt(6)) + ( (-1/sqrt(2)) )*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm 1: (1)(-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) = -1 / sqrt(12) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nTerm 2: 0.\n\nTerm3: (-1)(1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) = -1/(sqrt(12)) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nAdding them: (-1/(2\u221a3)) + 0 + (-1/(2\u221a3)) )= -2/(2\u221a3) = -1/\u221a3.\n\nSo the absolute value squared is ( (-1/\u221a3) )^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.\n",

So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nThe eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is |v0> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nThe probability is |<v0 | \u03c8>|^2.\n\nSo compute the inner product <v0 | \u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSecond term: 0.\n\nThird term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSo the inner product is [ (-1/sqrt(12)) ) ] + [ (-1/sqrt(12)) ] = (-2)/sqrt(12).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) as 2*sqrt(3), so (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is | (-1/sqrt(3)) |^2 = (1/3).\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the inner product calculation.\n\nCompute each component:\n\nv0 = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\n\u03c8 = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nInner product is sum over i: v0_i * \u03c8_i.\n\nSo:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + (0)*(2/sqrt(6)) + ( (-1/sqrt(2)) )*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm 1: (1)(-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) = -1 / sqrt(12) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nTerm 2: 0.\n\nTerm3: (-1)(1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) = -1/(sqrt(12)) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nAdding them: (-1/(2\u221a3)) + 0 + (-1/(2\u221a3)) )= -2/(2\u221a3) = -1/\u221a3.\n\nSo the absolute value squared is ( (-1/\u221a3) )^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1/3.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific outcome. \n\nAlright, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but wait a second, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, right? So the vector should have a magnitude of 1. Let me check that. The components are -1, 2, and 1. So the square of each component's absolute value is 1, 4, and 1. Adding them up gives 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Hmm, but for a state vector, it should be normalized, so perhaps the actual state is this vector divided by sqrt(6). Because the square of the norm has to be 1. Otherwise, it's not a valid quantum state. Wait, but the question didn't mention normalizing it, so maybe I'm supposed to consider it as is? Or perhaps I should normalize it before proceeding. Because in quantum mechanics, states are represented by unit vectors, so I think the correct approach is to normalize it. So the state vector |\u03c8> is ( -1, 2, 1 )^T divided by sqrt(6). \n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)). Third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, so P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:\n\nP = [ [0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n       [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n       [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] ]\n\nWait, that's the structure of P. Now, I need to find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0. Hmm, in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. So first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues. Then, the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude associated with that eigenvalue.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The observable P is a Hermitian operator because in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For P to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Looking at P, since all the elements are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So let's see if P equals P^T.\n\nThe transpose of P would have the first column as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second column as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third column as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Comparing this to the original P, which is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo the transpose would be:\n\nColumn 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nColumn 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nColumn 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nWhich is the same as the original matrix, so P is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So that's good, it's a valid observable.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are real, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. We need to find the probability that the outcome is 0.\n\nSo first, find the eigenvalues of P. Let's compute the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues \u03bb satisfy det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nThe matrix P - \u03bb I is:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\n[ 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nNow, the determinant of this matrix is:\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     |\n\n|1/\u221a2   -\u03bb     1/\u221a2 |\n\n| 0      1/\u221a2    -\u03bb    |\n\nCalculating the determinant:\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] ) - (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] ) + 0 * det(...).\n\nSo the first term is -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] = -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] = -(1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb)/\u221a2 ] = -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (\u03bb) / 2\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo the determinant is: -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2 )\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) ) + (\u03bb/2 )\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2 )\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nSo the characteristic equation is: -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0 or \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1. The question asks for the probability of getting 0.\n\nNow, for each eigenvalue, we need to find the corresponding eigenvectors, and then compute the projection of the state |\u03c8> onto each eigenvector. The square of the absolute value of that projection gives the probability.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, since P is a projection operator, perhaps it's easier. Wait, no, P is the observable, not necessarily a projection operator. Because P is Hermitian, but it's not necessarily idempotent (i.e., P^2=P). Let me check. Compute P squared.\n\nWait, let me compute P squared. Let's compute each element.\n\nP squared is P multiplied by P.\n\nFirst row:\n\nElement (1,1): 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = (1/2) + 0 = 1/2.\n\nElement (1,2): 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) )= 0.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, when you multiply two matrices, each element is the dot product of a row of the first matrix and a column of the second matrix.\n\nWait, so P squared is P * P.\n\nLet me compute it step by step.\n\nCompute element (1,1):\n\nRow 1 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nColumn 1 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nDot product: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 0 + (1/2) + 0 = 1/2.\n\nElement (1,2):\n\nRow 1 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nColumn 2 of P: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nDot product: 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) )= 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nElement (1,3):\n\nRow 1: [0,1/\u221a2,0]\n\nColumn 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nDot product: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nWait, so the first row of P squared is [1/2, 0, 1/2].\n\nSecond row:\n\nElement (2,1):\n\nRow 2 of P: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nColumn 1 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nDot product: (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 = 0.\n\nElement (2,2):\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nColumn 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nDot product: (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) )= (1/2) + 0 + (1/2) )= 1.\n\nElement (2,3):\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nColumn 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nDot product: (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 )= 0.\n\nSo the second row is [0, 1, 0].\n\nThird row:\n\nElement (3,1):\n\nRow 3 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nColumn 1 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nDot product: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nElement (3,2):\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nColumn 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nDot product: 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) )= 0.\n\nElement (3,3):\n\nRow 3: [0,1/\u221a2,0]\n\nColumn 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nDot product: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nSo P squared is:\n\n[ [1/2, 0, 1/2],\n  [0, 1, 0],\n  [1/2, 0, 1/2] ]\n\nHmm, but if P is a projection operator, then P^2 should equal P. Let me check if that's the case.\n\nLooking at the (1,1) element of P squared: 1/2, but in P it's 0. So P squared is not equal to P. So P is not a projection operator. So that approach won't work.\n\nBack to eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. So for each eigenvalue \u03bb, we can find the eigenvectors and then find the projection.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, the probability of getting 0 is the expectation value of the projection onto the eigenspace corresponding to 0. But wait, no, the probability is the sum of the squares of the amplitudes for each eigenvector in that eigenspace.\n\nWait, but wait another approach. Since the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1, the possible outcomes are these. The probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of |\u03c8> in the eigenspace of 0.\n\nWait, but perhaps the eigenspace for 0 is more than one dimension. So perhaps the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 form a subspace, and the projection of |\u03c8> onto this subspace gives the probability.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the operator P has a two-dimensional eigenspace for \u03bb=0, and another for \u03bb=1 and \u03bb=-1. Let me check.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to proceed by finding the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nLet's start with \u03bb=0.\n\nThe equation (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 \u2192 P |v> = 0.\n\nSo for \u03bb=0, the system is:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(v1 + v3) )= 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 again, v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are vectors where v2=0, and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors can be written as (v1, 0, -v1) where v1 is any real number. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). Because (v1,0,-v1) = v1*(1,0,-1).\n\nWait, no. Wait, if v1 is any scalar, then the eigenvectors are multiples of (1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nLet me plug in a vector (1,0,-1) into P and see if it's an eigenvector with \u03bb=0.\n\nP * (1, 0, -1) = [ (0)(1) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + 0*(-1) , (1/\u221a2)(1) + 0*(0) + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) , 0*(1) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + 0*(-1) ]\n\nCalculating each component:\n\nFirst component: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(1) + 0 + (1/\u221a2)(-1) )= (1/\u221a2 - 1/\u221a2 )=0.\n\nThird component: 0 + 0 + 0 =0.\n\nSo P*(1,0,-1) = (0,0,0) = 0*(1,0,-1), so yes, it's an eigenvector with \u03bb=0.\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1). So any vector in this space is a multiple of this vector.\n\nNow, the state |\u03c8> is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T, but we should normalize it. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the normalized state is ( (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nWe can compute the projection of |\u03c8> onto the eigenspace of \u03bb=0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is the inner product of |\u03c8> with the eigenvector (1,0,-1) normalized.\n\nThe eigenvector is (1,0,-1), and its norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThe inner product between |\u03c8> and this eigenvector is:\n\n(-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)).\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\n= (-2)/(sqrt(12)) )\n\nSimplify sqrt(12)= 2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2\u221a3.\n\nSo inner product = (-2)/(2\u221a3) )= (-1)/\u221a3.\n\nThe square of the absolute value is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Because sometimes when you have multiple eigenvectors, you have to sum the squares of the projections onto each orthogonal eigenvector in the same eigenspace. But in this case, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so the probability is just the square of the amplitude.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n",

So the state vector |\u03c8> is ( -1, 2, 1 )^T divided by sqrt(6). \n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)). Third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, so P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:\n\nP = [ [0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n       [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n       [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] ]\n\nWait, that's the structure of P. Now, I need to find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0. Hmm, in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. So first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues. Then, the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude associated with that eigenvalue.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The observable P is a Hermitian operator because in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For P to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Looking at P, since all the elements are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So let's see if P equals P^T.\n\nThe transpose of P would have the first column as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second column as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third column as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Comparing this to the original P, which is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo the transpose would be:\n\nColumn 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nColumn 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nColumn 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nWhich is the same as the original matrix, so P is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So that's good, it's a valid observable.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are real, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. We need to find the probability that the outcome is 0.\n\nSo first, find the eigenvalues of P. Let's compute the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues \u03bb satisfy det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nThe matrix P - \u03bb I is:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\n[ 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nNow, the determinant of this matrix is:\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     |\n\n|1/\u221a2   -\u03bb     1/\u221a2 |\n\n| 0      1/\u221a2    -\u03bb    |\n\nCalculating the determinant:\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] ) - (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] ) + 0 * det(...).\n\nSo the first term is -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] = -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] = -(1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb)/\u221a2 ] = -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (\u03bb) / 2\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo the determinant is: -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2 )\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) ) + (\u03bb/2 )\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2 )\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nSo the characteristic equation is: -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0 or \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1. The question asks for the probability of getting 0.\n\nNow, for each eigenvalue, we need to find the corresponding eigenvectors, and then compute the projection of the state |\u03c8> onto each eigenvector. The square of the absolute value of that projection gives the probability.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, since P is a projection operator, perhaps it's easier. Wait, no, P is the observable, not necessarily a projection operator. Because P is Hermitian, but it's not necessarily idempotent (i.e., P^2=P). Let me check. Compute P squared.\n\nWait, let me compute P squared. Let's compute each element.\n\nP squared is P multiplied by P.\n\nFirst row:\n\nElement (1,1): 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = (1/2) + 0 = 1/2.\n\nElement (1,2): 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) )= 0.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, when you multiply two matrices, each element is the dot product of a row of the first matrix and a column of the second matrix.\n\nWait, so P squared is P * P.\n\nLet me compute it step by step.\n\nCompute element (1,1):\n\nRow 1 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nColumn 1 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nDot product: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 0 + (1/2) + 0 = 1/2.\n\nElement (1,2):\n\nRow 1 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nColumn 2 of P: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nDot product: 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) )= 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nElement (1,3):\n\nRow 1: [0,1/\u221a2,0]\n\nColumn 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nDot product: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nWait, so the first row of P squared is [1/2, 0, 1/2].\n\nSecond row:\n\nElement (2,1):\n\nRow 2 of P: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nColumn 1 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nDot product: (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 = 0.\n\nElement (2,2):\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nColumn 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nDot product: (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) )= (1/2) + 0 + (1/2) )= 1.\n\nElement (2,3):\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nColumn 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nDot product: (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 )= 0.\n\nSo the second row is [0, 1, 0].\n\nThird row:\n\nElement (3,1):\n\nRow 3 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nColumn 1 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nDot product: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nElement (3,2):\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nColumn 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nDot product: 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) )= 0.\n\nElement (3,3):\n\nRow 3: [0,1/\u221a2,0]\n\nColumn 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nDot product: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nSo P squared is:\n\n[ [1/2, 0, 1/2],\n  [0, 1, 0],\n  [1/2, 0, 1/2] ]\n\nHmm, but if P is a projection operator, then P^2 should equal P. Let me check if that's the case.\n\nLooking at the (1,1) element of P squared: 1/2, but in P it's 0. So P squared is not equal to P. So P is not a projection operator. So that approach won't work.\n\nBack to eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. So for each eigenvalue \u03bb, we can find the eigenvectors and then find the projection.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, the probability of getting 0 is the expectation value of the projection onto the eigenspace corresponding to 0. But wait, no, the probability is the sum of the squares of the amplitudes for each eigenvector in that eigenspace.\n\nWait, but wait another approach. Since the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1, the possible outcomes are these. The probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of |\u03c8> in the eigenspace of 0.\n\nWait, but perhaps the eigenspace for 0 is more than one dimension. So perhaps the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 form a subspace, and the projection of |\u03c8> onto this subspace gives the probability.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the operator P has a two-dimensional eigenspace for \u03bb=0, and another for \u03bb=1 and \u03bb=-1. Let me check.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to proceed by finding the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nLet's start with \u03bb=0.\n\nThe equation (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 \u2192 P |v> = 0.\n\nSo for \u03bb=0, the system is:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(v1 + v3) )= 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 again, v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are vectors where v2=0, and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors can be written as (v1, 0, -v1) where v1 is any real number. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). Because (v1,0,-v1) = v1*(1,0,-1).\n\nWait, no. Wait, if v1 is any scalar, then the eigenvectors are multiples of (1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nLet me plug in a vector (1,0,-1) into P and see if it's an eigenvector with \u03bb=0.\n\nP * (1, 0, -1) = [ (0)(1) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + 0*(-1) , (1/\u221a2)(1) + 0*(0) + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) , 0*(1) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + 0*(-1) ]\n\nCalculating each component:\n\nFirst component: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(1) + 0 + (1/\u221a2)(-1) )= (1/\u221a2 - 1/\u221a2 )=0.\n\nThird component: 0 + 0 + 0 =0.\n\nSo P*(1,0,-1) = (0,0,0) = 0*(1,0,-1), so yes, it's an eigenvector with \u03bb=0.\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1). So any vector in this space is a multiple of this vector.\n\nNow, the state |\u03c8> is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T, but we should normalize it. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the normalized state is ( (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nWe can compute the projection of |\u03c8> onto the eigenspace of \u03bb=0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is the inner product of |\u03c8> with the eigenvector (1,0,-1) normalized.\n\nThe eigenvector is (1,0,-1), and its norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThe inner product between |\u03c8> and this eigenvector is:\n\n(-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)).\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\n= (-2)/(sqrt(12)) )\n\nSimplify sqrt(12)= 2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2\u221a3.\n\nSo inner product = (-2)/(2\u221a3) )= (-1)/\u221a3.\n\nThe square of the absolute value is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Because sometimes when you have multiple eigenvectors, you have to sum the squares of the projections onto each orthogonal eigenvector in the same eigenspace. But in this case, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so the probability is just the square of the amplitude.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) and obtaining the outcome \\( 0 \\) for a given quantum state. The state of the system is provided as \\( (-1, 2, 1)^T \\), which is not normalized. The norm of the state is calculated as \\( \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6} \\), so the normalized state is:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe observable \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{pmatrix} \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the probability of measuring \\( 0 \\), we first determine the eigenvalues of \\( P \\). The characteristic equation is derived as:\n\n\\[\n\\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\implies -\\lambda^3 + \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\lambda (1 - \\lambda^2) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalues are \\( \\lambda = 0, 1, -1 \\). The eigenvalue \\( \\lambda = 0 \\) corresponds to the outcome \\( 0 \\). The eigenvectors for \\( \\lambda = 0 \\) are found by solving \\( P |v\\rangle = 0 \\), leading to the eigenspace spanned by the normalized eigenvector:\n\n\\[\n|v_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is the square of the projection of \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) onto \\( |v_0\\rangle \\). The inner product is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right)(0) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{12}} + 0 + \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, \\( \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3} \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value:\n\n\\[\nP(0) = \\left|\\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle\\right|^2 = \\left(\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), corresponding to option C.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nThe problem states that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait a second, that seems a bit odd because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually supposed to be normalized, right? So the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1. Let me check that.\n\nCalculating the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which is about 2.45. So this isn't a unit vector. But wait, maybe the question doesn't require normalization because perhaps we're supposed to normalize it first? Or perhaps the observable is such that the probabilities can be calculated without worrying about the overall scaling. Hmm, not sure yet, but I'll keep that in mind.\n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So, P is a 3x3 matrix.\n\nI remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues represent the possible measurement outcomes. So to find the possible results of measuring P, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the probability of getting 0 as the measurement. So perhaps 0 is an eigenvalue of P. Let me check what the eigenvalues of P are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P. If 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability would be the square of the amplitude of the component of the state vector in that eigenvector's direction.\n\nBut first, let me try to compute the eigenvalues of P.\n\nThe matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nI'll write this matrix out:\n\nP = [ [0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n       [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n       [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] ]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (P - \u03bb I) and set it to zero.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nLet me compute P - \u03bb I:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2]\n[ 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * something.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute using expansion by minors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can see some symmetry in P. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it's symmetric, which makes sense because observables are Hermitian (so symmetric in real case). So the eigenvalues should be real.\n\nLet me consider whether there's a pattern or whether I can find eigenvectors by inspection.\n\nLooking at P, the first row is [0, a, 0], where a=1/\u221a2. The second row is [a, 0, a], and the third row is [0, a, 0].\n\nHmm, maybe we can guess an eigenvector. Let me try the vector (1, 0, 1). Let's see what P does to it.\n\nP * (1,0,1) = [0*1 + a*0 + 0*1, a*1 + 0*0 + a*1, 0*1 + a*0 + 0*1] = [0, 2a, 0]. But 2a is 2*(1/\u221a2)=\u221a2. So [0,\u221a2,0]. That's not a multiple of (1,0,1), so that's not an eigenvector. Hmm, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the eigenvectors are symmetric in some way. Let me think about the possible eigenvalues. Suppose \u03bb is 0. Then the equation (P - 0 I) v = 0 would imply P v = 0. So let's see if there's a non-trivial solution.\n\nLooking at the equations:\n\nFrom row 1: (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nFrom row 2: (1/\u221a2)(v1 + v3) = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0.\n\nFrom row 3: (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSo v2 must be zero, and v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 would be of the form (a, 0, -a). So, yes, 0 is an eigenvalue of P. So the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state vector in the direction of this eigenvector.\n\nWait, but the state vector given is (-1, 2, 1). Let's denote this as |\u03c8> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, I should normalize it first because the norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the observable is such that the probabilities can be calculated without normalization, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the given vector, but I think it's better to normalize it because probabilities are based on the normalized state.\n\nSo the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nNow, the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are (a, 0, -a). So let's take a=1 for simplicity, so the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]. We can normalize this vector as well. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1].\n\nWait, but in this case, the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is any scalar multiple of [1, 0, -1]. So when we compute the inner product between the state |\u03c8> and this eigenvector, that will give the amplitude, and the square of the absolute value will give the probability.\n\nSo the state |\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nThe eigenvector |v> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1].\n\nThe inner product <v|\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] dotted with (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nSo compute the dot product:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ (1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) ) ].\n\nThat's (1/sqrt(12)) [ -1 + 0 -1 ] = (1/sqrt(12)) * (-2) = (-2)/sqrt(12) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3. That would correspond to option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recheck the steps.\n\n1. State vector: [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so normalized to (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\n2. Observable P is a 3x3 matrix as given.\n\n3. To find the probability of getting 0, we find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\n4. From P*v = 0, we get v2=0, and v1 = -v3.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nThe problem states that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait a second, that seems a bit odd because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually supposed to be normalized, right? So the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1. Let me check that.\n\nCalculating the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which is about 2.45. So this isn't a unit vector. But wait, maybe the question doesn't require normalization because perhaps we're supposed to normalize it first? Or perhaps the observable is such that the probabilities can be calculated without worrying about the overall scaling. Hmm, not sure yet, but I'll keep that in mind.\n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So, P is a 3x3 matrix.\n\nI remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues represent the possible measurement outcomes. So to find the possible results of measuring P, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the probability of getting 0 as the measurement. So perhaps 0 is an eigenvalue of P. Let me check what the eigenvalues of P are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P. If 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability would be the square of the amplitude of the component of the state vector in that eigenvector's direction.\n\nBut first, let me try to compute the eigenvalues of P.\n\nThe matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nI'll write this matrix out:\n\nP = [ [0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n       [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n       [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] ]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (P - \u03bb I) and set it to zero.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nLet me compute P - \u03bb I:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2]\n[ 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * something.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute using expansion by minors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can see some symmetry in P. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it's symmetric, which makes sense because observables are Hermitian (so symmetric in real case). So the eigenvalues should be real.\n\nLet me consider whether there's a pattern or whether I can find eigenvectors by inspection.\n\nLooking at P, the first row is [0, a, 0], where a=1/\u221a2. The second row is [a, 0, a], and the third row is [0, a, 0].\n\nHmm, maybe we can guess an eigenvector. Let me try the vector (1, 0, 1). Let's see what P does to it.\n\nP * (1,0,1) = [0*1 + a*0 + 0*1, a*1 + 0*0 + a*1, 0*1 + a*0 + 0*1] = [0, 2a, 0]. But 2a is 2*(1/\u221a2)=\u221a2. So [0,\u221a2,0]. That's not a multiple of (1,0,1), so that's not an eigenvector. Hmm, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the eigenvectors are symmetric in some way. Let me think about the possible eigenvalues. Suppose \u03bb is 0. Then the equation (P - 0 I) v = 0 would imply P v = 0. So let's see if there's a non-trivial solution.\n\nLooking at the equations:\n\nFrom row 1: (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nFrom row 2: (1/\u221a2)(v1 + v3) = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0.\n\nFrom row 3: (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSo v2 must be zero, and v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 would be of the form (a, 0, -a). So, yes, 0 is an eigenvalue of P. So the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state vector in the direction of this eigenvector.\n\nWait, but the state vector given is (-1, 2, 1). Let's denote this as |\u03c8> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, I should normalize it first because the norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the observable is such that the probabilities can be calculated without normalization, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the given vector, but I think it's better to normalize it because probabilities are based on the normalized state.\n\nSo the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nNow, the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are (a, 0, -a). So let's take a=1 for simplicity, so the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]. We can normalize this vector as well. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1].\n\nWait, but in this case, the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is any scalar multiple of [1, 0, -1]. So when we compute the inner product between the state |\u03c8> and this eigenvector, that will give the amplitude, and the square of the absolute value will give the probability.\n\nSo the state |\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nThe eigenvector |v> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1].\n\nThe inner product <v|\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] dotted with (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nSo compute the dot product:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ (1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) ) ].\n\nThat's (1/sqrt(12)) [ -1 + 0 -1 ] = (1/sqrt(12)) * (-2) = (-2)/sqrt(12) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3. That would correspond to option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recheck the steps.\n\n1. State vector: [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so normalized to (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\n2. Observable P is a 3x3 matrix as given.\n\n3. To find the probability of getting 0, we find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\n4. From P*v = 0, we get v2=0, and v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors are multiples of [1, 0, -1].\n\n5. The normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1].\n\n6. The inner product between |\u03c8> and |v> is (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ] = (1/sqrt(12)) * (-2) = (-2)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\n7. The probability is |(-1)/sqrt(3)|\u00b2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the answer should be option C, which is 1/3.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the quantum system described by the state vector and the observable matrix.\n\n### Step 1: State Vector\nThe state vector is given as \\( |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\).

The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait, wait\u2014that's probably a vector in three dimensions. And the observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The elements of P are given in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0).\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the measurement of P will yield 0 at time t. So, I need to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P.\n\nWait, in quantum mechanics, when you have an observable represented by a matrix, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that matrix. So I should probably find the eigenvalues of P first. The probability of each eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state vector.\n\nBut wait, the state vector is given. Let me write it down. The state is a column vector [-1, 2, 1]. Oh wait, but I think I should normalize it first because the probabilities need to sum to 1. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about normalization, so maybe the given vector is already normalized. Let me check: the sum of the squares of the elements is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the vector has a magnitude of sqrt(6). So to get a unit vector, I should divide each component by sqrt(6). But wait, the problem says the state is given by that column matrix\u2014so maybe the state isn't normalized yet. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually assumed to be normalized. Oh, perhaps I should normalize it first before proceeding.\n\nWait, let me think. The state vector is |\u03c8> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2) = sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the state is normalized. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized. So I think I should proceed by using the normalized state.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So I need to find whether 0 is an eigenvalue of P, and if so, compute the corresponding eigenvector's overlap with the state vector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the expectation value, but no, the question is about the probability of getting 0, so it's about the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n\nSo first, I need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix P.

So it's a Hermitian matrix, which makes sense because observables are represented by Hermitian operators.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nLet's compute the determinant of (P - \u03bb I). The matrix (P - \u03bb I) will be:\n\nRow 1: [ -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]\n\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2) ]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ]\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n| -\u03bb          1/sqrt(2)         0         |\n|1/sqrt(2)   -\u03bb           1/sqrt(2)  |\n| 0           1/sqrt(2)        -\u03bb         |\n\nTo compute this determinant, I can expand along the first row.\n\ndet = -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 * something.\n\nWait, let me write it out:\n\ndet = -\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-\u03bb / sqrt(2)) ) ] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (\u03bb / sqrt(2)) ) = (\u03bb) / 2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ndet = -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) + (\u03bb/2 )\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2 )\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me compute each part again.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ] = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2 )\n\nSecond term: -(1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ] \u2192 (1/sqrt(2)) * (\u03bb / sqrt(2)) ) \u2192 (\u03bb)/2. But since the expansion is:\n\n= (-\u03bb) * minor_11 - (1/sqrt(2)) * minor_12 + 0 * minor_13\n\nSo the second term is minus (1/sqrt(2)) multiplied by the minor of element (1,2), which is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:\n\n[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]\n[0, -\u03bb ]\n\nSo that determinant is (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -\u03bb / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the second term is - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb / sqrt(2)) ) = - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) \u2192 (\u03bb) / 2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2)\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2 )\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nWait, that simplifies to -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nSo the equation is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2 ) =0.\n\nSo the solutions are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1.\n\nWait, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, then compute the squared amplitude of the state vector in that eigenvector.\n\nSo first, find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 \u2192 P |v> = 0.\n\nSo the system is:\n\nRow 1: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/sqrt(2) =0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nRow 3: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as row 1, so v2=0.\n\nSo from row 1 and 3, v2=0. From row 2, v3 = -v1.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [v1, 0, -v1]^T. Let's choose v1 =1, then the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nBut wait, we need to normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the eigenvectors again. Because I might have made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me double-check.\n\nSo, when \u03bb=0, the matrix P becomes:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]\n\nRow3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\n0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0 \u2192 v1 + v3=0 \u2192 v3= -v1.\n\n0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3=0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors have v2=0, v3=-v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T.\n\nSo yes, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nSo the eigenvector |v0> for \u03bb=0 is [1,0,-1]^T multiplied by 1/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the state vector is given as |\u03c8> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. But we need to normalize it first.\n\nWait, the state vector's norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the normalized state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nNow, the probability of measuring 0 is the squared magnitude of the inner product between |\u03c8> and |v0>.\n\nSo compute <v0 | \u03c8>.\n\nLet's compute this inner product:\n\n<v0 | \u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] * (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nSo, (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(6)) [ (1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) ]\n\n= (1/sqrt(12)) [ (-1) + 0 + (-1) ] = (1/sqrt(12)) * (-2).\n\nWait, wait, that's [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ] = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(12)) * (-2) = (-2)/sqrt(12) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait, the inner product is (-1)/sqrt(3), so the magnitude squared is (1/3). So the probability is 1/3.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.\n\nThe state vector is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1].\n\nThe eigenvector |v0> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1].\n\nTheir inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) ]\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(12)) [ (-1) + 0 + (-1) ] \u2192 (1/sqrt(12)) * (-2) \u2192 (-2)/sqrt(12) \u2192 which simplifies to (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) \u2192 -1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe square of the absolute value is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I correctly accounted for normalization. The state vector in the problem is given as [-1, 2, 1], which is not normalized. So in our calculation, we correctly normalized it by dividing by sqrt(6). Similarly, the eigenvector was normalized by 1/sqrt(2). So the inner product calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the observable P has other eigenvalues, but we're only interested in the 0 eigenvalue here.\n\nSo the answer is 1/3, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the probability of measuring a certain value. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait, wait\u2014that's probably a vector in three dimensions. And the observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The elements of P are given in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0).\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the measurement of P will yield 0 at time t. So, I need to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P.\n\nWait, in quantum mechanics, when you have an observable represented by a matrix, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that matrix. So I should probably find the eigenvalues of P first. The probability of each eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state vector.\n\nBut wait, the state vector is given. Let me write it down. The state is a column vector [-1, 2, 1]. Oh wait, but I think I should normalize it first because the probabilities need to sum to 1. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about normalization, so maybe the given vector is already normalized. Let me check: the sum of the squares of the elements is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the vector has a magnitude of sqrt(6). So to get a unit vector, I should divide each component by sqrt(6). But wait, the problem says the state is given by that column matrix\u2014so maybe the state isn't normalized yet. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually assumed to be normalized. Oh, perhaps I should normalize it first before proceeding.\n\nWait, let me think. The state vector is |\u03c8> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2) = sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the state is normalized. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized. So I think I should proceed by using the normalized state.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So I need to find whether 0 is an eigenvalue of P, and if so, compute the corresponding eigenvector's overlap with the state vector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the expectation value, but no, the question is about the probability of getting 0, so it's about the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n\nSo first, I need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix P. Let me write down matrix P:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n]\n\nHmm, that's a 3x3 matrix. Let me see if it's symmetric. Yes, because P_ij = P_ji. So it's a Hermitian matrix, which makes sense because observables are represented by Hermitian operators.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nLet's compute the determinant of (P - \u03bb I). The matrix (P - \u03bb I) will be:\n\nRow 1: [ -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]\n\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2) ]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ]\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n| -\u03bb          1/sqrt(2)         0         |\n|1/sqrt(2)   -\u03bb           1/sqrt(2)  |\n| 0           1/sqrt(2)        -\u03bb         |\n\nTo compute this determinant, I can expand along the first row.\n\ndet = -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 * something.\n\nWait, let me write it out:\n\ndet = -\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-\u03bb / sqrt(2)) ) ] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (\u03bb / sqrt(2)) ) = (\u03bb) / 2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ndet = -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) + (\u03bb/2 )\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2 )\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me compute each part again.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ] = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2 )\n\nSecond term: -(1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ] \u2192 (1/sqrt(2)) * (\u03bb / sqrt(2)) ) \u2192 (\u03bb)/2. But since the expansion is:\n\n= (-\u03bb) * minor_11 - (1/sqrt(2)) * minor_12 + 0 * minor_13\n\nSo the second term is minus (1/sqrt(2)) multiplied by the minor of element (1,2), which is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:\n\n[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]\n[0, -\u03bb ]\n\nSo that determinant is (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -\u03bb / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the second term is - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb / sqrt(2)) ) = - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) \u2192 (\u03bb) / 2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2)\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2 )\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nWait, that simplifies to -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nSo the equation is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2 ) =0.\n\nSo the solutions are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1.\n\nWait, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, then compute the squared amplitude of the state vector in that eigenvector.\n\nSo first, find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 \u2192 P |v> = 0.\n\nSo the system is:\n\nRow 1: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/sqrt(2) =0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nRow 3: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as row 1, so v2=0.\n\nSo from row 1 and 3, v2=0. From row 2, v3 = -v1.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [v1, 0, -v1]^T. Let's choose v1 =1, then the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nBut wait, we need to normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the eigenvectors again. Because I might have made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me double-check.\n\nSo, when \u03bb=0, the matrix P becomes:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]\n\nRow3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\n0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0 \u2192 v1 + v3=0 \u2192 v3= -v1.\n\n0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3=0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors have v2=0, v3=-v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T.\n\nSo yes, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nSo the eigenvector |v0> for \u03bb=0 is [1,0,-1]^T multiplied by 1/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the state vector is given as |\u03c8> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. But we need to normalize it first.\n\nWait, the state vector's norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the normalized state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nNow, the probability of measuring 0 is the squared magnitude of the inner product between |\u03c8> and |v0>.\n\nSo compute <v0 | \u03c8>.\n\nLet's compute this inner product:\n\n<v0 | \u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] * (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nSo, (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(6)) [ (1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) ]\n\n= (1/sqrt(12)) [ (-1) + 0 + (-1) ] = (1/sqrt(12)) * (-2).\n\nWait, wait, that's [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ] = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(12)) * (-2) = (-2)/sqrt(12) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait, the inner product is (-1)/sqrt(3), so the magnitude squared is (1/3). So the probability is 1/3.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.\n\nThe state vector is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1].\n\nThe eigenvector |v0> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1].\n\nTheir inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) ]\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(12)) [ (-1) + 0 + (-1) ] \u2192 (1/sqrt(12)) * (-2) \u2192 (-2)/sqrt(12) \u2192 which simplifies to (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) \u2192 -1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe square of the absolute value is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I correctly accounted for normalization. The state vector in the problem is given as [-1, 2, 1], which is not normalized. So in our calculation, we correctly normalized it by dividing by sqrt(6). Similarly, the eigenvector was normalized by 1/sqrt(2). So the inner product calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the observable P has other eigenvalues, but we're only interested in the 0 eigenvalue here.\n\nSo the answer is 1/3, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) to yield 0.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a three-component vector, so it's a qutrit system maybe? Or maybe it's a 3-level system. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should have unit length, right? Because the probabilities should add up to 1. Let me check: the components are -1, 2, 1. So the square of the magnitudes would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the state vector has a norm of sqrt(6). That means it's not normalized. So perhaps the state is given as ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )? Because that would make the sum 1. But the question says the state is (-1,2,1), so maybe we have to normalize it first before proceeding.\n\nNext, the observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down P's elements. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix. I think I should write it out:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n]\n\nWait, that looks a bit symmetric. Hmm. But what observable does this correspond to? Well, perhaps it's a projection operator or a Hermitian matrix, but let's check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, each element P_ij must equal the complex conjugate of P_ji. Since all the elements are real here, P_ij = P_ji for all i,j. Let me check:\n\nP[1,2] is 1/sqrt(2), and P[2,1] is 1/sqrt(2), so that's symmetric. Similarly, P[2,3] is 1/sqrt(2), and P[3,2] is 1/sqrt(2). P[1,3] is 0, and P[3,1] is 0. So yes, P is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So it's a valid observable.\n\nNow, the question is to find the probability that measuring P gives 0. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of an observable are the eigenvalues of the matrix. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which ones are 0, but wait, does P have 0 as an eigenvalue?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the observable P has eigenvalues that are the possible outcomes. So to find the probability that a measurement yields 0, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0 and compute the probability of the state being in that eigenspace.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P is a projection operator onto a certain subspace, and the eigenvalue 0 would correspond to the orthogonal subspace. But let me think again. Let's compute the eigenvalues of P.\n\nWait, another approach: since P is a 3x3 matrix, maybe it's easier to find its eigenvalues. Let's try to compute the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P - \u03bb I would be:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ],\n[ 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2) ],\n[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ) ] + 0 [ ... ]\n\nWait, maybe expanding the determinant along the first row.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2) ], [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ] ] )\n\nminus (1/sqrt(2)) * det( [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ], [0, -\u03bb ] ] )\n\nplus 0 * something.\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\nWhich is -\u03bb * [ \u03bb^2 - (1/2) ) ]\n\nSecond term: -(1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (0) ) ]\n\nWhich is -(1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-\u03bb)/sqrt(2) ) ] = -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb)/sqrt(2) ) = (\u03bb)/(2 )\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb^2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) ) = 0.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2 ) = 0.\n\nWait, wait: let me re-calculate the first term. Wait, the first term is -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2)) ) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2).\n\nThen the second term is (\u03bb/2), so the total is:\n\n(-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb/2 ) + (\u03bb/2 ) ) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nSo the equation is -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0 or \u03bb\u00b2 =1 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So when you measure P, you can get 1, 0, or -1.\n\nBut the question is, what's the probability of getting 0? So we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb=0, and then find the overlap with the state vector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is a subspace, and the probability is the square of the norm of the projection of the state onto that subspace.\n\nSo first, let's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nSetting \u03bb=0 in (P - 0 I ) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nSo the system of equations is:\n\n0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0.\n\n0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 same as first equation, v2=0.\n\nSo from first equation, v2=0.\n\nFrom the second equation, v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) = v1 (1, 0, -1).\n\nSo the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). But wait, wait, that's only one vector, but perhaps we need to normalize it. The normalized eigenvector would be (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo any vector in the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is a scalar multiple of this.\n\nSo the eigenspace is one-dimensional. Now, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1), but wait, it's not normalized. Let's compute its norm.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6 \u2192 norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).\n\nNow, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state in the eigenspace of 0.\n\nBut since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1), the amplitude is the inner product between the state and the eigenvector.\n\nWait, the eigenvector is (1,0,-1), but I think I should normalize it first. Because when calculating probabilities, we need to use orthonormal eigenvectors.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the inner product between the state and this eigenvector is:\n\n( (-1/sqrt(6)) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * ( -1/sqrt(2) ) )\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\n= [ (-1 -1) ] / (sqrt(12)) )\n\n= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 since sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3)\n\n\u2192 -1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe amplitude is -1/sqrt(3). The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/3).\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the inner product correctly.\n\nWait, the state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]\n\nThe eigenvector for 0 is |v> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nSo the inner product <v | \u03c8> is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )\n\n= (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).\n\nWhich is (-2)/(sqrt(12)) ) \u2192 sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2*sqrt(3).\n\nSo (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Another approach: since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection operator onto this space is |v><v|, where |v> is the normalized eigenvector.\n\nSo the probability is the expectation value of the projection operator, which is <\u03c8| v><v |\u03c8> = |<v|\u03c8>|^2.\n\nWhich is what I calculated: 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector.\n\nWait, when solving P v =0, the equations were:\n\nv2=0,\n\nv1 + v3=0,\n\nv2=0.\n\nSo v3=-v1, and v2=0.\n\nSo any vector in the eigenspace is (v1, 0, -v1) = v1*(1, 0, -1).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the inner product is correct, and the probability is 1/3. So the correct answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a three-component vector, so it's a qutrit system maybe? Or maybe it's a 3-level system. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should have unit length, right? Because the probabilities should add up to 1. Let me check: the components are -1, 2, 1. So the square of the magnitudes would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the state vector has a norm of sqrt(6). That means it's not normalized. So perhaps the state is given as ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )? Because that would make the sum 1. But the question says the state is (-1,2,1), so maybe we have to normalize it first before proceeding.\n\nNext, the observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down P's elements. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix. I think I should write it out:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n]\n\nWait, that looks a bit symmetric. Hmm. But what observable does this correspond to? Well, perhaps it's a projection operator or a Hermitian matrix, but let's check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, each element P_ij must equal the complex conjugate of P_ji. Since all the elements are real here, P_ij = P_ji for all i,j. Let me check:\n\nP[1,2] is 1/sqrt(2), and P[2,1] is 1/sqrt(2), so that's symmetric. Similarly, P[2,3] is 1/sqrt(2), and P[3,2] is 1/sqrt(2). P[1,3] is 0, and P[3,1] is 0. So yes, P is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So it's a valid observable.\n\nNow, the question is to find the probability that measuring P gives 0. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of an observable are the eigenvalues of the matrix. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which ones are 0, but wait, does P have 0 as an eigenvalue?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the observable P has eigenvalues that are the possible outcomes. So to find the probability that a measurement yields 0, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0 and compute the probability of the state being in that eigenspace.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P is a projection operator onto a certain subspace, and the eigenvalue 0 would correspond to the orthogonal subspace. But let me think again. Let's compute the eigenvalues of P.\n\nWait, another approach: since P is a 3x3 matrix, maybe it's easier to find its eigenvalues. Let's try to compute the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P - \u03bb I would be:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ],\n[ 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2) ],\n[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ) ] + 0 [ ... ]\n\nWait, maybe expanding the determinant along the first row.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2) ], [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ] ] )\n\nminus (1/sqrt(2)) * det( [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ], [0, -\u03bb ] ] )\n\nplus 0 * something.\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\nWhich is -\u03bb * [ \u03bb^2 - (1/2) ) ]\n\nSecond term: -(1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (0) ) ]\n\nWhich is -(1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-\u03bb)/sqrt(2) ) ] = -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb)/sqrt(2) ) = (\u03bb)/(2 )\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb^2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) ) = 0.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2 ) = 0.\n\nWait, wait: let me re-calculate the first term. Wait, the first term is -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2)) ) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2).\n\nThen the second term is (\u03bb/2), so the total is:\n\n(-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb/2 ) + (\u03bb/2 ) ) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nSo the equation is -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0 or \u03bb\u00b2 =1 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So when you measure P, you can get 1, 0, or -1.\n\nBut the question is, what's the probability of getting 0? So we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb=0, and then find the overlap with the state vector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is a subspace, and the probability is the square of the norm of the projection of the state onto that subspace.\n\nSo first, let's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nSetting \u03bb=0 in (P - 0 I ) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nSo the system of equations is:\n\n0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0.\n\n0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 same as first equation, v2=0.\n\nSo from first equation, v2=0.\n\nFrom the second equation, v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) = v1 (1, 0, -1).\n\nSo the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). But wait, wait, that's only one vector, but perhaps we need to normalize it. The normalized eigenvector would be (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo any vector in the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is a scalar multiple of this.\n\nSo the eigenspace is one-dimensional. Now, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1), but wait, it's not normalized. Let's compute its norm.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6 \u2192 norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).\n\nNow, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state in the eigenspace of 0.\n\nBut since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1), the amplitude is the inner product between the state and the eigenvector.\n\nWait, the eigenvector is (1,0,-1), but I think I should normalize it first. Because when calculating probabilities, we need to use orthonormal eigenvectors.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the inner product between the state and this eigenvector is:\n\n( (-1/sqrt(6)) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * ( -1/sqrt(2) ) )\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\n= [ (-1 -1) ] / (sqrt(12)) )\n\n= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 since sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3)\n\n\u2192 -1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe amplitude is -1/sqrt(3). The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/3).\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the inner product correctly.\n\nWait, the state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]\n\nThe eigenvector for 0 is |v> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nSo the inner product <v | \u03c8> is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )\n\n= (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).\n\nWhich is (-2)/(sqrt(12)) ) \u2192 sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2*sqrt(3).\n\nSo (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Another approach: since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection operator onto this space is |v><v|, where |v> is the normalized eigenvector.\n\nSo the probability is the expectation value of the projection operator, which is <\u03c8| v><v |\u03c8> = |<v|\u03c8>|^2.\n\nWhich is what I calculated: 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector.\n\nWait, when solving P v =0, the equations were:\n\nv2=0,\n\nv1 + v3=0,\n\nv2=0.\n\nSo v3=-v1, and v2=0.\n\nSo any vector in the eigenspace is (v1, 0, -v1) = v1*(1, 0, -1).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the inner product is correct, and the probability is 1/3. So the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the given state vector and observable matrix to determine the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) to yield 0.\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the state vector\nThe state vector is given as \\( (-1, 2, 1) \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually represented as column vectors, and they need to be normalized, right? So the first thing I should probably do is check if this state is normalized. To normalize, I need to calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.\n\nSo the components are -1, 2, and 1. Squaring each: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding them up: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh wait, that's 6. So the state isn't normalized because the sum isn't 1. That might complicate things. But maybe the observable's measurement doesn't require normalization? Or perhaps I can proceed by normalizing the state first.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability of getting a certain outcome when measuring the observable P. So maybe I can proceed without normalizing because the probabilities are calculated using the state vector's components as they are. Let me think. I remember that the probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude, which is the inner product of the state with the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue we're measuring.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should first normalize the state. Let me try that. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be each component divided by sqrt(6). So the state becomes ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the state isn't normalized, but the probabilities will still work out because we're dealing with a specific observable. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed and see.\n\nThe observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So the matrix P is:\n\n[ 0          1/\u221a2        0      ]\n[1/\u221a2       0          1/\u221a2   ]\n[ 0          1/\u221a2        0      ]\n\nWait, I'm trying to remember what this matrix might represent. It's a Hermitian matrix because all the elements are real and symmetric across the diagonal. So P is a Hermitian operator, which makes sense because observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian operators.\n\nNow, when we measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So the first step is to find the eigenvalues of P because the possible measurement results are these eigenvalues, and we're interested in the probability of getting zero.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem is asking for the probability of getting zero as a result. So I need to find if zero is an eigenvalue of P. Let me find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nThe eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nSo let me write out the matrix P - \u03bbI:\n\n[ -\u03bb       1/\u221a2      0     ]\n[1/\u221a2     -\u03bb       1/\u221a2   ]\n[ 0        1/\u221a2     -\u03bb     ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n| -\u03bb       1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2     -\u03bb       1/\u221a2   |\n| 0        1/\u221a2     -\u03bb     |\n\nCalculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit involved. Let me try expanding it.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] + 0 * [ ... ].\n\nWait, the third term is zero because the third element in the first row is zero, so that entire term drops out.\n\nSo expanding the first minor (the part under the first element -\u03bb):\n\nThe minor matrix is:\n[ -\u03bb       1/\u221a2   ]\n[1/\u221a2     -\u03bb     ]\n\nThe determinant is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nThen the first term is -\u03bb multiplied by this: -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nThe second minor is for the element 1/\u221a2 in the first row, second column. The sign here is (-1)^(1+2) = -1, so the term becomes - (1/\u221a2) multiplied by the determinant of the minor matrix.\n\nThe minor matrix for the second element is the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing first row and second column:\n\n[1/\u221a2     1/\u221a2   ]\n[0        -\u03bb     ]\n\nThe determinant of this is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) = (-\u03bb/\u221a2).\n\nSo the second term is - (1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) ] multiplied by (-1) for the sign. Wait, no, the expansion is:\n\nThe element is in position (1,2), so the coefficient is (-1)^(1+2) = -1.\n\nSo the second term is (1/\u221a2) * [ determinant of minor ] * (-1) ?\n\nWait, no, the expansion is:\n\nsum_{j=1 to 3} [ element (i,j) * (-1)^{i+j} * M_{i,j} ]\n\nSo for i=1, j=2: element is 1/\u221a2. So the term is (1/\u221a2) * (-1)^(1+2) * minor determinant.\n\nThe minor determinant for j=2 is the determinant of:\n\n[1/\u221a2     1/\u221a2   ]\n[0        -\u03bb     ]\n\nWhich is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (0)(1/\u221a2) ) = -\u03bb /\u221a2.\n\nSo the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (-1)^(3) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) )\n\nWhich is (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) )\n\nSimplify: (1/\u221a2) * (\u03bb/\u221a2) ) * 1.\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step. The coefficient is (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1.\n\nSo the term is (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ]\n\nSo that's (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (1/\u221a2) * (\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nPutting it all together, the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + [ (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) ] \n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the signs. Let me correct that.\n\nThe determinant expansion is:\n\n= (-\u03bb) * [ (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ ( (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] \n+ 0 * [ ... ]\n\nSo the first term is -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nThe second term is -(1/\u221a2) multiplied by [ (1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb) - 0 ].\n\nWait, the minor for the second element is:\n\n[ (row 2, column 1 and 3), (row 3, column 1 and 3) ]\n\nWait no, when you remove row 1 and column 2, the minor is:\n\n[1/\u221a2    1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[0       -\u03bb   ]\n\nSo the determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) = (-\u03bb/\u221a2).\n\nSo the second term is -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nTerm 2: -(1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ] = -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) )= \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2.\n\nLet me expand the first term:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) + \u03bb/2.\n\nWait, -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (1/2)\u03bb.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (1/2)\u03bb + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nBecause (1/2 \u03bb) + (1/2 \u03bb) is \u03bb.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor this: \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1) = 0.\n\nWhich gives \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2) ) = 0. So the solutions are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1.\n\nWait, wait, let me make sure I did the determinant correctly. Because if I have P as the given matrix, perhaps the trace can help. The trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of the eigenvalues should be zero. The eigenvalues we found are 0, 1, -1. Their sum is 0, which matches the trace. So that's correct.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then compute the projection of the given state onto that eigenvector, and then take the square of the absolute value of that projection to get the probability.\n\nAlternatively, since the state might not be normalized, I might have to normalize it first. Let me check that.\n\nThe given state is (-1, 2, 1). The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1 ) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is ( (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nSo the state is |\u03c8> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nNow, to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, I need to solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is as given. Let me write out the equations for (P)|v> = 0.\n\nSo P is:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nSo when we multiply by the vector (a, b, c), we get:\n\nRow 1: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0*c = 0 \u2192 (1/sqrt(2)) b = 0 \u2192 b = 0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2)) a + 0*b + (1/sqrt(2)) c = 0 \u2192 (a + c)/sqrt(2) = 0 \u2192 a + c = 0.\n\nRow 3: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0*c = 0 \u2192 same as row 1, which gives b=0.\n\nSo from row 1 and 3, b must be zero.\n\nFrom row 2, a = -c.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form (a, 0, -a). We can choose a to be any scalar, say a = 1, then the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1).\n\nBut wait, that's a possible eigenvector for eigenvalue 0. However, I should check if it's normalized. Let's compute its norm: sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.\n\nSo the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.\n\nNow, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the state |\u03c8> in this eigenvector. The amplitude is the inner product of |\u03c8> and the eigenvector.\n\nSo let me compute the inner product:\n\n\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9 = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] \u00b7 [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )\n\nSo that's:\n\n[ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\nWhich adds up to (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2*sqrt(3).\n\nSo the inner product is (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/3).\n\nWait, let me compute that again.\n\nEach term:\n\nFirst term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) = (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSecond term is zero.\n\nThird term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSo adding the first and third terms: (-1/(2\u221a3)) + (-1/(2\u221a3)) ) = (-2)/(2\u221a3) ) = (-1)/\u221a3.\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 1/3, so the correct answer should be C.\n",

The sign here is (-1)^(1+2) = -1, so the term becomes - (1/\u221a2) multiplied by the determinant of the minor matrix.\n\nThe minor matrix for the second element is the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing first row and second column:\n\n[1/\u221a2     1/\u221a2   ]\n[0        -\u03bb     ]\n\nThe determinant of this is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) = (-\u03bb/\u221a2).\n\nSo the second term is - (1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) ] multiplied by (-1) for the sign. Wait, no, the expansion is:\n\nThe element is in position (1,2), so the coefficient is (-1)^(1+2) = -1.\n\nSo the second term is (1/\u221a2) * [ determinant of minor ] * (-1) ?\n\nWait, no, the expansion is:\n\nsum_{j=1 to 3} [ element (i,j) * (-1)^{i+j} * M_{i,j} ]\n\nSo for i=1, j=2: element is 1/\u221a2. So the term is (1/\u221a2) * (-1)^(1+2) * minor determinant.\n\nThe minor determinant for j=2 is the determinant of:\n\n[1/\u221a2     1/\u221a2   ]\n[0        -\u03bb     ]\n\nWhich is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (0)(1/\u221a2) ) = -\u03bb /\u221a2.\n\nSo the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (-1)^(3) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) )\n\nWhich is (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) )\n\nSimplify: (1/\u221a2) * (\u03bb/\u221a2) ) * 1.\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step. The coefficient is (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1.\n\nSo the term is (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ]\n\nSo that's (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (1/\u221a2) * (\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nPutting it all together, the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + [ (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) ] \n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the signs. Let me correct that.\n\nThe determinant expansion is:\n\n= (-\u03bb) * [ (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ ( (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] \n+ 0 * [ ... ]\n\nSo the first term is -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nThe second term is -(1/\u221a2) multiplied by [ (1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb) - 0 ].\n\nWait, the minor for the second element is:\n\n[ (row 2, column 1 and 3), (row 3, column 1 and 3) ]\n\nWait no, when you remove row 1 and column 2, the minor is:\n\n[1/\u221a2    1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[0       -\u03bb   ]\n\nSo the determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) = (-\u03bb/\u221a2).\n\nSo the second term is -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nTerm 2: -(1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ] = -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) )= \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2.\n\nLet me expand the first term:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) + \u03bb/2.\n\nWait, -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (1/2)\u03bb.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (1/2)\u03bb + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nBecause (1/2 \u03bb) + (1/2 \u03bb) is \u03bb.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor this: \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1) = 0.\n\nWhich gives \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2) ) = 0. So the solutions are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1.\n\nWait, wait, let me make sure I did the determinant correctly. Because if I have P as the given matrix, perhaps the trace can help. The trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of the eigenvalues should be zero. The eigenvalues we found are 0, 1, -1. Their sum is 0, which matches the trace. So that's correct.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then compute the projection of the given state onto that eigenvector, and then take the square of the absolute value of that projection to get the probability.\n\nAlternatively, since the state might not be normalized, I might have to normalize it first. Let me check that.\n\nThe given state is (-1, 2, 1). The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1 ) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is ( (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nSo the state is |\u03c8> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nNow, to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, I need to solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is as given. Let me write out the equations for (P)|v> = 0.\n\nSo P is:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nSo when we multiply by the vector (a, b, c), we get:\n\nRow 1: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0*c = 0 \u2192 (1/sqrt(2)) b = 0 \u2192 b = 0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2)) a + 0*b + (1/sqrt(2)) c = 0 \u2192 (a + c)/sqrt(2) = 0 \u2192 a + c = 0.\n\nRow 3: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0*c = 0 \u2192 same as row 1, which gives b=0.\n\nSo from row 1 and 3, b must be zero.\n\nFrom row 2, a = -c.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form (a, 0, -a). We can choose a to be any scalar, say a = 1, then the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1).\n\nBut wait, that's a possible eigenvector for eigenvalue 0. However, I should check if it's normalized. Let's compute its norm: sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.\n\nSo the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.\n\nNow, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the state |\u03c8> in this eigenvector. The amplitude is the inner product of |\u03c8> and the eigenvector.\n\nSo let me compute the inner product:\n\n\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9 = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] \u00b7 [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )\n\nSo that's:\n\n[ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\nWhich adds up to (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2*sqrt(3).\n\nSo the inner product is (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/3).\n\nWait, let me compute that again.\n\nEach term:\n\nFirst term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) = (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSecond term is zero.\n\nThird term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSo adding the first and third terms: (-1/(2\u221a3)) + (-1/(2\u221a3)) ) = (-2)/(2\u221a3) ) = (-1)/\u221a3.\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 1/3, so the correct answer should be C.\n\n\nThe state of the system is given as a column vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). To proceed, the state is normalized by dividing each component by the norm, which is \\( \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6} \\). Thus, the normalized state is:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe observable \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{pmatrix} \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the probability of measuring \\( P \\) to yield \\( 0 \\), we first determine the eigenvalues of \\( P \\) by solving the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\). The eigenvalues are found to be \\( \\lambda = 0, 1, -1 \\). The eigenvector corresponding to \\( \\lambda = 0 \\) is determined by solving \\( (P - 0I)|v\\rangle = 0 \\). This gives the eigenvector:\n\n\\[\n|v\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nNormalizing this eigenvector, we get:\n\n\\[\n|v\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) and \\( |v\\rangle \\):\n\n\\[\n\\langle v | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating the inner product:\n\n\\[\n\\langle v | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right) + 0 \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}} = -\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{12}} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\nThe absolute value squared is:\n\n\\[\n|\\langle v | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nAnswer: C",
