      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and they decay into other particles. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles after the decay.\n\nWait, the problem says Pi(+) is at rest and it decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. So the neutrino's mass is negligible, right? I think neutrinos are almost massless, so maybe we can ignore it in calculations.\n\nThe reaction is Pi(+) \u2192 mu(+) + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to keep the total momentum zero. That's conservation of momentum.\n\nBut wait, because the neutrino's mass is so small, maybe its momentum is almost the same as the muon's. But I'm not sure how that plays into the calculations.\n\nThe total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But the neutrino's energy comes from its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible. The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus kinetic energy.\n\nLet me think about the energy and momentum conservation equations.\n\nEnergy conservation: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu\nMomentum conservation: p_pi (which is zero) = p_mu + p_nu. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since they're opposite, their magnitudes are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.\n\nBut since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum of the products must be zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.\n\nHmm, but neutrinos have very little mass. So their energy is approximately equal to their momentum (since E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), and if m is negligible, E \u2248 pc). But for the muon, which has a significant mass, its energy would be E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ).\n\nSo, let's write down the energy and momentum equations.\n\nSince p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), but opposite in direction, let's denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum, then neutrino's momentum is also p, but opposite.\n\nSo energy conservation: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.\n\nE_pi is the rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV.\n\nE_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, units are in MeV, so perhaps we can express everything in units where c=1. So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ). Similarly, E_nu \u2248 p, since m_nu is negligible.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p.\n\nHmm, so that's an equation with one variable p. Let me denote sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) as E_mu, which equals 139.6 - p.\n\nSo, sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\np^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side: 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2.\n\nSo, subtracting the left side:\n\np^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2.\n\nSubtract p^2 from both sides:\n\n105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 p.\n\nNow, compute 139.6^2 and 105.7^2.\n\n139.6 squared: Let's compute 140^2 is 19600, minus 0.4*2*140 + 0.4^2. Wait, wait, 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.\n\n105.7^2: Let's compute 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and cross term 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100 +5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo plugging back into the equation:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 p.\n\nLet me compute 2*139.6 = 279.2.\n\nSo,\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.\n\nRearranging:\n\n279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.\n\nCalculate 19488.16 minus 11172.49.\n\n19488.16 - 11172.49 = Let me compute:\n\n19488.16\n-11172.49\n= 8315.67.\n\nSo,\n\n279.2 p = 8315.67.\n\np = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 Let's compute this.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 279.2.\n\n8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 29.8 MeV/c.\n\nWait, wait, is that correct? Wait, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 30 is too high. Let's compute 29.8:\n\n279.2 * 29.8 = ?\n\n279.2 * 30 = 8376.\n\nMinus 279.2 *0.2 = 55.84 \u2192 8376 -55.84 =8320.16.\n\nBut the numerator is 8315.67, which is about 8320.16 - 8315.67 = 4.49 less. So maybe 29.8 - (4.49)/(279.2) \u2248 29.8 - 0.016 \u2248 29.784. So approx 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but the neutrino's energy is p, so E_nu = p \u2248 29.78 MeV.\n\nThen the muon's energy is E_mu = 139.6 - p \u2248 139.6 -29.78 \u2248 109.82 MeV.\n\nBut the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu = 109.82 -105.7 =4.12 MeV.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options.\n\nOption D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait, what about the neutrino's kinetic energy? Since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its entire energy is kinetic. So the neutrino's KE is 29.8 MeV. The muon's KE is 4.12 MeV. So the products are muon KE 4.12 MeV and neutrino KE 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo looking at the options, option D says 4.12 and 29.8 MeV. So the KE of the muon is 4.12, neutrino is 29.8.\n\nWait, but the question says \"Find KE of product particles in,\" which are mu(+) and nu. So the options list two KEs, presumably for each particle.\n\nSo option D is the correct one.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when a particle at rest decays into other particles, energy and momentum must be conserved. But wait, how does that work exactly?\n\nThe problem says Pi(+) is stationary and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? I think in this case, the neutrino's mass is considered negligible compared to the others. So maybe I can treat it as massless for this calculation.\n\nSo, the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Because the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. So, the muon and neutrino will move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n\nLet me think about the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nThe muon's energy will be its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. But since the muon is moving, its total energy is gamma times m_mu c squared. But I'm not sure if I need to calculate gamma here.\n\nWait, the neutrino is massless, so its energy is just its momentum times c. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is -p (since they're opposite), so its energy is |p| c. Similarly, the muon's energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Or wait, units can get confusing here. Let me think in terms of units where c=1, which is common in particle physics.\n\nSo in natural units, c=1, so energy and mass have the same units. The pion is at rest, so energy before decay is m_pi c\u00b2, which is 139.6 MeV.\n\nAfter decay, the muon has energy E_mu and the neutrino has energy E_nu. Since momentum must be conserved, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p. But the neutrino is massless, so E_nu = p. For the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2), because E\u00b2 = p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c^4, and with c=1, E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m\u00b2.\n\nSo the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) + p.\n\nThis must equal the pion's rest mass: 139.6 MeV.\n\nSo the equation is sqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.\n\nHmm, how do I solve for p here? Let me set x = p for simplicity. Then the equation becomes sqrt(x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.\n\nLet me subtract x from both sides: sqrt(x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x.\n\nNow square both sides: x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x\u00b2.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides: (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.\n\nLet me compute the squares:\n\n139.6 squared is approximately 139.6 * 139.6. Let me calculate that. 140^2 is 19600, but since it's 139.6, which is 140 - 0.4. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. Hmm wait, but wait, wait, 139.6 is 139.6, not 140-0.4. Let me compute 139.6 * 139.6 correctly. Let me compute 139.6 * 139.6:\n\n139.6 * 139.6 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 - 112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, 105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let's compute 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo plug into the equation:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n2*139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.\n\nCompute the right side: 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let's subtract: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nSo, 2 *139.6 x = 8315.67.\n\nDivide both sides by 2*139.6:\n\nx = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6).\n\nCompute denominator: 2*139.6 = 279.2.\n\nSo x = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 Let me compute that. Let's see, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8. Wait, but 279.2 * 29.7 is approximately 279.2 *30 =8376 minus 279.2 *0.3=83.76 \u2192 8376 -83.76=8292.24. Hmm, but 8315.67 is a bit higher than 8292.24. So 29.7 + (8315.67-8292.24)/(279.2) \u2192 29.7 + (23.43)/279.2 \u2248 23.43/279.2 is about 0.084. So x\u224829.784.\n\nSo x \u224829.784 MeV/c (since we're in units where c=1, but in actual terms, x is momentum in MeV/c). So p = ~29.784 MeV/c.\n\nNow, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p \u224829.784 MeV.\n\nThe muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nCompute 29.784^2: approx 29.784 *29.784. Let me compute 30^2=900, so 29.784 is 30 - 0.216. So (30 -0.216)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 \u2248 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 \u2248 887.086656.\n\n105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.\n\nSo E_mu = sqrt(887.086656 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.576656).\n\nWhat's sqrt(12059.58)? Let me see: 110^2=12100, which is a bit higher. 109^2=11881. So 109.5^2= (109 +0.5)^2=109^2 + 2*109*0.5 +0.25=11881 +109 +0.25=11990.25. Hmm, 109.5^2=11990.25, which is less than 12059.58. Let's compute 109.8^2: (109 +0.8)^2 = 109^2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8^2= 11881 + 174.4 + 0.64=12056.04. Oh, that's very close to 12059.58.\n\nSo sqrt(12059.58) is approximately 109.8 + (12059.58 -12056.04)/(2*109.8).\n\nThe difference is 3.54. So 3.54/(219.6) \u2248 0.0161.\n\nSo E_mu \u2248 109.8 +0.0161 \u2248 109.816 MeV.\n\nSo the muon's energy is about 109.816 MeV, and the neutrino's is about 29.784 MeV.\n\nBut wait, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = 109.816 +29.784 \u2248139.6 MeV, which matches the pion's rest mass, so that checks out.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of each particle is their total energy minus their rest mass energy.\n\nSo for the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.816 -105.7 \u22484.116 MeV.\n\nWait, that's approximately 4.12 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino's kinetic energy is E_nu since its rest mass is zero. So KE_nu = E_nu =29.784 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic because it's massless, right? Because E=pc for a massless particle, and kinetic energy is the same as total energy in that case.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the question is to find the KE of the product particles. So the muon has KE \u22484.12 MeV, and the neutrino has KE \u224829.784 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\nYes, that matches. So the answer would be option D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the equation, when I had sqrt(x\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = (139.6 - x), I squared both sides correctly and rearranged. Let me check the algebra again.\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = M -x, where M is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.\n\nSquaring both sides: x\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 = M\u00b2 - 2 M x +x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract x\u00b2: m_mu\u00b2 = M\u00b2 - 2 M x.\n\nSo 2 M x = M\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo x = (M\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2)/(2 M)\n\nWait, that's a simpler way to compute x. Let me compute that.\n\nM=139.6, m_mu=105.7.\n\nM squared is (139.6)^2= 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\nm_mu squared is (105.7)^2=11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo M\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2=19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV\u00b2.\n\nThen x = 8315.67 / (2 *139.6) \u2192 denominator 279.2.\n\nSo 8315.67 /279.2 \u2192 let's compute 279.2 *29= 8096.8, and 279.2 *29.784\u22488315.67. So x=29.784 MeV/c.\n\nSo that part's correct.\n\nThen E_mu = sqrt(29.784^2 +105.7^2) \u2192 sqrt(887.086 + 11172.49)= sqrt(12059.576)= approx 109.816 MeV.\n\nSo KE_mu=109.816-105.7=4.116 MeV \u2192 ~4.12 MeV.\n\nKE_nu=29.784 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which is very close. So the correct answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when a particle at rest decays into other particles, energy and momentum must be conserved. But wait, how does that work exactly?\n\nThe problem says Pi(+) is stationary and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? I think in this case, the neutrino's mass is considered negligible compared to the others. So maybe I can treat it as massless for this calculation.\n\nSo, the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Because the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. So, the muon and neutrino will move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n\nLet me think about the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nThe muon's energy will be its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. But since the muon is moving, its total energy is gamma times m_mu c squared. But I'm not sure if I need to calculate gamma here.\n\nWait, the neutrino is massless, so its energy is just its momentum times c. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is -p (since they're opposite), so its energy is |p| c. Similarly, the muon's energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Or wait, units can get confusing here. Let me think in terms of units where c=1, which is common in particle physics.\n\nSo in natural units, c=1, so energy and mass have the same units. The pion is at rest, so energy before decay is m_pi c\u00b2, which is 139.6 MeV.\n\nAfter decay, the muon has energy E_mu and the neutrino has energy E_nu. Since momentum must be conserved, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p. But the neutrino is massless, so E_nu = p. For the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2), because E\u00b2 = p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c^4, and with c=1, E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m\u00b2.\n\nSo the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) + p.\n\nThis must equal the pion's rest mass: 139.6 MeV.\n\nSo the equation is sqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.\n\nHmm, how do I solve for p here? Let me set x = p for simplicity. Then the equation becomes sqrt(x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.\n\nLet me subtract x from both sides: sqrt(x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x.\n\nNow square both sides: x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x\u00b2.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides: (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.\n\nLet me compute the squares:\n\n139.6 squared is approximately 139.6 * 139.6. Let me calculate that. 140^2 is 19600, but since it's 139.6, which is 140 - 0.4. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. Hmm wait, but wait, wait, 139.6 is 139.6, not 140-0.4. Let me compute 139.6 * 139.6 correctly. Let me compute 139.6 * 139.6:\n\n139.6 * 139.6 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 - 112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, 105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let's compute 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo plug into the equation:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n2*139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.\n\nCompute the right side: 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let's subtract: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nSo, 2 *139.6 x = 8315.67.\n\nDivide both sides by 2*139.6:\n\nx = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6).\n\nCompute denominator: 2*139.6 = 279.2.\n\nSo x = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 Let me compute that. Let's see, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8. Wait, but 279.2 * 29.7 is approximately 279.2 *30 =8376 minus 279.2 *0.3=83.76 \u2192 8376 -83.76=8292.24. Hmm, but 8315.67 is a bit higher than 8292.24. So 29.7 + (8315.67-8292.24)/(279.2) \u2192 29.7 + (23.43)/279.2 \u2248 23.43/279.2 is about 0.084. So x\u224829.784.\n\nSo x \u224829.784 MeV/c (since we're in units where c=1, but in actual terms, x is momentum in MeV/c). So p = ~29.784 MeV/c.\n\nNow, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p \u224829.784 MeV.\n\nThe muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nCompute 29.784^2: approx 29.784 *29.784. Let me compute 30^2=900, so 29.784 is 30 - 0.216. So (30 -0.216)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 \u2248 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 \u2248 887.086656.\n\n105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.\n\nSo E_mu = sqrt(887.086656 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.576656).\n\nWhat's sqrt(12059.58)? Let me see: 110^2=12100, which is a bit higher. 109^2=11881. So 109.5^2= (109 +0.5)^2=109^2 + 2*109*0.5 +0.25=11881 +109 +0.25=11990.25. Hmm, 109.5^2=11990.25, which is less than 12059.58. Let's compute 109.8^2: (109 +0.8)^2 = 109^2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8^2= 11881 + 174.4 + 0.64=12056.04. Oh, that's very close to 12059.58.\n\nSo sqrt(12059.58) is approximately 109.8 + (12059.58 -12056.04)/(2*109.8).\n\nThe difference is 3.54. So 3.54/(219.6) \u2248 0.0161.\n\nSo E_mu \u2248 109.8 +0.0161 \u2248 109.816 MeV.\n\nSo the muon's energy is about 109.816 MeV, and the neutrino's is about 29.784 MeV.\n\nBut wait, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = 109.816 +29.784 \u2248139.6 MeV, which matches the pion's rest mass, so that checks out.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of each particle is their total energy minus their rest mass energy.\n\nSo for the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.816 -105.7 \u22484.116 MeV.\n\nWait, that's approximately 4.12 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino's kinetic energy is E_nu since its rest mass is zero. So KE_nu = E_nu =29.784 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic because it's massless, right? Because E=pc for a massless particle, and kinetic energy is the same as total energy in that case.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the question is to find the KE of the product particles. So the muon has KE \u22484.12 MeV, and the neutrino has KE \u224829.784 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\nYes, that matches. So the answer would be option D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the equation, when I had sqrt(x\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = (139.6 - x), I squared both sides correctly and rearranged. Let me check the algebra again.\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = M -x, where M is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.\n\nSquaring both sides: x\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 = M\u00b2 - 2 M x +x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract x\u00b2: m_mu\u00b2 = M\u00b2 - 2 M x.\n\nSo 2 M x = M\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo x = (M\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2)/(2 M)\n\nWait, that's a simpler way to compute x. Let me compute that.\n\nM=139.6, m_mu=105.7.\n\nM squared is (139.6)^2= 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\nm_mu squared is (105.7)^2=11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo M\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2=19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV\u00b2.\n\nThen x = 8315.67 / (2 *139.6) \u2192 denominator 279.2.\n\nSo 8315.67 /279.2 \u2192 let's compute 279.2 *29= 8096.8, and 279.2 *29.784\u22488315.67. So x=29.784 MeV/c.\n\nSo that part's correct.\n\nThen E_mu = sqrt(29.784^2 +105.7^2) \u2192 sqrt(887.086 + 11172.49)= sqrt(12059.576)= approx 109.816 MeV.\n\nSo KE_mu=109.816-105.7=4.116 MeV \u2192 ~4.12 MeV.\n\nKE_nu=29.784 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which is very close. So the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion, **\u03c0\u207a**, into a muon, **\u03bc\u207a**, and a neutrino, **\u03bd**.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. Oh wait, but the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, right? So I don't have to worry about its rest energy much.\n\nThe problem states that the Pi(+) is stationary. That's an important detail because if it's stationary, its initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum before decay is zero, which means the momenta of the products after decay must also sum to zero. So the mu+ and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That's something I'll probably need to use.\n\nGiven data:\nRest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2.\nRest mass of mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2.\nThe neutrino's rest mass is zero, I think. So it's treated as a massless particle.\n\nWait, but the question is about the kinetic energy of the product particles. So I need to find the kinetic energies of the mu+ and the neutrino.\n\nHmm, I remember that in decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum come into play. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is just its rest energy. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nSo the initial energy is m_pi c\u00b2, which is 139.6 MeV.\n\nAfter decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. The muon's energy is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is zero).\n\nSo E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.\n\nE_mu = m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu\nE_nu = K_nu\n\nSo, 139.6 MeV = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.\n\nBut wait, I also have to consider momentum conservation. The pion is stationary, so the total momentum after must be zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.\n\nLet me denote p_mu as the magnitude of the muon's momentum and p_nu as the neutrino's momentum. Since they're opposite, p_mu = p_nu = p.\n\nNow, the energy of each particle is related to their momentum by their respective relativistic energy-momentum relations.\n\nFor the muon:\nE_mu\u00b2 = (p c)\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)\u00b2\nSo E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nFor the neutrino:\nE_nu\u00b2 = (p c)^2 c\u00b2 + 0 (since m_nu is zero)\nSo E_nu = p c\n\nWait, no. Wait, the neutrino's energy is just p c, because E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 c\u00b2 when m=0? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The energy of a particle is given by E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 c\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. So for the neutrino, m=0, so E_nu = pc.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, E\u00b2 = (p c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. So for neutrino, m=0, so E = p c.\n\nSo E_nu = p c.\n\nAnd for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nNow, since the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.\n\nSo substituting, we get:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6.\n\nLet me denote p c as x for simplicity. Then the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.\n\nHmm, solving for x.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation: sqrt(x\u00b2 + a\u00b2) = (139.6 - x), where a is 105.7.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = (139.6 - x)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side: 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6 x + x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\na\u00b2 = 139.6\u00b2 - 2 *139.6 x.\n\nSo,\n\n2 *139.6 x = 139.6\u00b2 - a\u00b2.\n\nCalculate the right side.\n\nCompute 139.6 squared: 139.6^2 = approx (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.\n\na is 105.7, so a squared is 105.7^2 = approx (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo 139.6^2 - a^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nSo,\n\n2 *139.6 x = 8315.67.\n\nSo x = 8315.67 / (2 *139.6).\n\nCalculate denominator: 2 *139.6 = 279.2.\n\nx = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 Let's compute that.\n\nDividing 8315.67 by 279.2:\n\n279.2 * 29 = approx 279.2*30=8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67.\n\nWait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*(30-1) = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.\n\nHmm, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8. So 8096.8 is less than 8315.67. So the difference is 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.\n\nSo 279.2 * 0.8 = 223.36, which is close to 218.87. So approximately 29.8.\n\nWait, let me compute 279.2 * 29.8.\n\nWait, 29 *279.2 is 8096.8, and 0.8 *279.2 is 223.36. So total is 8096.8 +223.36=8320.16.\n\nBut our numerator is 8315.67, which is a bit less than 8320.16. So 29.8 would give a value slightly higher than needed. So perhaps it's about 29.78 or so.\n\nWait, but maybe a better way is to compute 8315.67 /279.2.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.\n\nSubtract 8096.8 from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.\n\nNow, 218.87 /279.2 \u2248 0.783.\n\nSo total x \u2248 29.783.\n\nSo x is approximately 29.783 MeV/c.\n\nWait, x is p c. So p = x/c.\n\nBut in any case, E_nu = x = 29.783 MeV.\n\nWait, but E_nu is the neutrino's energy, which is all kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero. So K_nu = 29.783 MeV.\n\nNow, what about the muon's energy?\n\nE_mu = sqrt( x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n29.783^2 \u2248 887.0.\n\n105.7^2 = 11172.49.\n\nSum: 887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49.\n\nsqrt(12059.49) \u2248 109.81 MeV.\n\nSo E_mu = 109.81 MeV.\n\nThe muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV. So its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2 = 109.81 - 105.7 \u2248 4.11 MeV.\n\nWait, so the muon's kinetic energy is about 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's is about 29.78 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo that's close.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in approximations.\n\nLet me re-calculate x.\n\nWe had x = 8315.67 / 279.2.\n\nLet me compute this more accurately.\n\nCompute 279.2 * 29.78 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.\n\nLet me do the division step by step.\n\n279.2 goes into 8315.67 how many times?\n\nFirst, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 as before.\n\nSubtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.\n\nNow, 279.2 * 0.78 = ?\n\n279.2 * 0.7=195.44.\n\n279.2 * 0.08=22.336.\n\nSo 0.78 is 195.44 +22.336=217.776.\n\nWhich is very close to 218.87.\n\nSo 0.78 gives 217.776, which is 1.094 less than 218.87.\n\nSo we need a little more than 0.78. Let's say 0.78 + (1.094/279.2) \u2248 0.78 + 0.0039 \u2248 0.7839.\n\nSo x \u224829.7839 MeV.\n\nSo E_nu =29.7839 MeV.\n\nE_mu = sqrt( (29.7839)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nCompute 29.7839^2: Let me compute 29.7839 *29.7839.\n\nApproximate as (30 - 0.2161)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.2161 + (0.2161)^2 \u2248 900 - 12.966 + 0.0467 \u2248 887.08.\n\n105.7^2=11172.49.\n\nSo sum is 887.08 +11172.49=12059.57.\n\nsqrt(12059.57) = 109.81 MeV.\n\nSo E_mu =109.81 MeV.\n\nKinetic energy of muon: 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.\n\nHmm, but let's see the options. Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's very close.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should check my initial assumption. Wait, when I set x = p c, and E_nu = x. But wait, is E_nu = p c or p c\u00b2? Wait, no, the energy equation is E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So for the neutrino, m=0, so E_nu = p c.\n\nYes, that's correct. So E_nu is p c. So the earlier approach is correct.\n\nSo the neutrino's energy is about 29.78 MeV, so its kinetic energy is that (since m=0).\n\nAnd the muon's kinetic energy is about 4.11 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo that's the closest. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the initial energy equation. The initial energy is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the sum of energies is E_mu + E_nu =139.6 MeV.\n\nE_mu is 109.81, E_nu is 29.78. Sum is 109.81 +29.78=139.59 MeV, which is very close to 139.6. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to compute the sum of the kinetic energies. 4.11 +29.78=33.89 MeV. Hmm, but that's not directly one of the options. But each KE is given in the options, so that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is D, with the muon's KE around 4.12 MeV and the neutrino's about 29.8 MeV.\n",

So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.\n\nLet me denote p_mu as the magnitude of the muon's momentum and p_nu as the neutrino's momentum. Since they're opposite, p_mu = p_nu = p.\n\nNow, the energy of each particle is related to their momentum by their respective relativistic energy-momentum relations.\n\nFor the muon:\nE_mu\u00b2 = (p c)\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)\u00b2\nSo E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nFor the neutrino:\nE_nu\u00b2 = (p c)^2 c\u00b2 + 0 (since m_nu is zero)\nSo E_nu = p c\n\nWait, no. Wait, the neutrino's energy is just p c, because E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 c\u00b2 when m=0? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The energy of a particle is given by E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 c\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. So for the neutrino, m=0, so E_nu = pc.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, E\u00b2 = (p c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. So for neutrino, m=0, so E = p c.\n\nSo E_nu = p c.\n\nAnd for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nNow, since the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.\n\nSo substituting, we get:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6.\n\nLet me denote p c as x for simplicity. Then the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.\n\nHmm, solving for x.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation: sqrt(x\u00b2 + a\u00b2) = (139.6 - x), where a is 105.7.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = (139.6 - x)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side: 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6 x + x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\na\u00b2 = 139.6\u00b2 - 2 *139.6 x.\n\nSo,\n\n2 *139.6 x = 139.6\u00b2 - a\u00b2.\n\nCalculate the right side.\n\nCompute 139.6 squared: 139.6^2 = approx (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.\n\na is 105.7, so a squared is 105.7^2 = approx (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo 139.6^2 - a^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nSo,\n\n2 *139.6 x = 8315.67.\n\nSo x = 8315.67 / (2 *139.6).\n\nCalculate denominator: 2 *139.6 = 279.2.\n\nx = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 Let's compute that.\n\nDividing 8315.67 by 279.2:\n\n279.2 * 29 = approx 279.2*30=8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67.\n\nWait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*(30-1) = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.\n\nHmm, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8. So 8096.8 is less than 8315.67. So the difference is 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.\n\nSo 279.2 * 0.8 = 223.36, which is close to 218.87. So approximately 29.8.\n\nWait, let me compute 279.2 * 29.8.\n\nWait, 29 *279.2 is 8096.8, and 0.8 *279.2 is 223.36. So total is 8096.8 +223.36=8320.16.\n\nBut our numerator is 8315.67, which is a bit less than 8320.16. So 29.8 would give a value slightly higher than needed. So perhaps it's about 29.78 or so.\n\nWait, but maybe a better way is to compute 8315.67 /279.2.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.\n\nSubtract 8096.8 from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.\n\nNow, 218.87 /279.2 \u2248 0.783.\n\nSo total x \u2248 29.783.\n\nSo x is approximately 29.783 MeV/c.\n\nWait, x is p c. So p = x/c.\n\nBut in any case, E_nu = x = 29.783 MeV.\n\nWait, but E_nu is the neutrino's energy, which is all kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero. So K_nu = 29.783 MeV.\n\nNow, what about the muon's energy?\n\nE_mu = sqrt( x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n29.783^2 \u2248 887.0.\n\n105.7^2 = 11172.49.\n\nSum: 887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49.\n\nsqrt(12059.49) \u2248 109.81 MeV.\n\nSo E_mu = 109.81 MeV.\n\nThe muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV. So its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2 = 109.81 - 105.7 \u2248 4.11 MeV.\n\nWait, so the muon's kinetic energy is about 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's is about 29.78 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo that's close.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in approximations.\n\nLet me re-calculate x.\n\nWe had x = 8315.67 / 279.2.\n\nLet me compute this more accurately.\n\nCompute 279.2 * 29.78 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.\n\nLet me do the division step by step.\n\n279.2 goes into 8315.67 how many times?\n\nFirst, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 as before.\n\nSubtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.\n\nNow, 279.2 * 0.78 = ?\n\n279.2 * 0.7=195.44.\n\n279.2 * 0.08=22.336.\n\nSo 0.78 is 195.44 +22.336=217.776.\n\nWhich is very close to 218.87.\n\nSo 0.78 gives 217.776, which is 1.094 less than 218.87.\n\nSo we need a little more than 0.78. Let's say 0.78 + (1.094/279.2) \u2248 0.78 + 0.0039 \u2248 0.7839.\n\nSo x \u224829.7839 MeV.\n\nSo E_nu =29.7839 MeV.\n\nE_mu = sqrt( (29.7839)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nCompute 29.7839^2: Let me compute 29.7839 *29.7839.\n\nApproximate as (30 - 0.2161)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.2161 + (0.2161)^2 \u2248 900 - 12.966 + 0.0467 \u2248 887.08.\n\n105.7^2=11172.49.\n\nSo sum is 887.08 +11172.49=12059.57.\n\nsqrt(12059.57) = 109.81 MeV.\n\nSo E_mu =109.81 MeV.\n\nKinetic energy of muon: 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.\n\nHmm, but let's see the options. Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's very close.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should check my initial assumption. Wait, when I set x = p c, and E_nu = x. But wait, is E_nu = p c or p c\u00b2? Wait, no, the energy equation is E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So for the neutrino, m=0, so E_nu = p c.\n\nYes, that's correct. So E_nu is p c. So the earlier approach is correct.\n\nSo the neutrino's energy is about 29.78 MeV, so its kinetic energy is that (since m=0).\n\nAnd the muon's kinetic energy is about 4.11 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo that's the closest. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the initial energy equation. The initial energy is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the sum of energies is E_mu + E_nu =139.6 MeV.\n\nE_mu is 109.81, E_nu is 29.78. Sum is 109.81 +29.78=139.59 MeV, which is very close to 139.6. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to compute the sum of the kinetic energies. 4.11 +29.78=33.89 MeV. Hmm, but that's not directly one of the options. But each KE is given in the options, so that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is D, with the muon's KE around 4.12 MeV and the neutrino's about 29.8 MeV.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:\n\n**Reaction:**  \n\\[\n\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu\n\\]  \nHere, the \\(\\pi^+\\) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) meson decays. The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, nu is a neutrino, right?\n\nThe given information is that the Pi(+) is stationary, and its rest mass is 139.6 MeV. The mu(+) has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. The options are for the kinetic energies of the products, so I need to figure out how much energy each has after the decay.\n\nI remember that in particle decays, the energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the Pi is initially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu, which implies their magnitudes are the same.\n\nLet me think about the energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the Pi, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nThe energy of each particle is the sum of their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. So, E_mu = m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu, and E_nu = p_nu c + K_nu (since the neutrino is massless, assuming it's a charged current interaction, but wait, neutrinos have mass but maybe here we treat them as massless for simplicity? Or maybe the rest mass is negligible. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but since the muon has a rest mass given, perhaps the neutrino's mass is considered zero here. Let me proceed with that assumption unless I hit a contradiction.)\n\nWait, but if the neutrino has mass, that complicates things. The problem doesn't give the neutrino's rest mass, so maybe it's intended to treat it as massless. So, for the neutrino, E_nu = p_nu c, and since it's massless, the rest mass term is zero.\n\nSo, the energy conservation equation would be:\n\nm_pi c\u00b2 = E_mu + E_nu\nWhich is:\n139.6 MeV = (m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu) + (p_nu c + K_nu)\n\nBut since the momenta are equal and opposite, p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude). Wait, but wait, the muon has mass, so p_mu = gamma m_mu v, and the neutrino's momentum is p_nu = E_nu / c\u00b2 * v_nu, but I might be getting tangled here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using four-momentum would be better. The invariant mass squared s is equal to (E_total)^2 - (p_total)^2 c\u00b2. But since the Pi is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero, so s = (m_pi c\u00b2)^2.\n\nAfter decay, the invariant mass squared should be (E_mu + E_nu)^2 - (p_mu c + p_nu c)^2. Since p_mu = -p_nu, the momentum terms add to zero. So, s is (E_mu + E_nu)^2 - (0)^2 = (m_pi c\u00b2)^2. So, that's consistent with energy and momentum conservation.\n\nWait, but that doesn't directly help me find the kinetic energies. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nLet me think about the decay in the rest frame of the Pi. The decay products must have equal and opposite momenta, so p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), but opposite in direction.\n\nThe total energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p_nu c. Since p_mu = p_nu, let's let p = p_mu = p_nu.\n\nSo, E_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 c^4 ), and E_nu = p c.\n\nThe total energy is E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 c^4 ) + p c = m_pi c\u00b2.\n\nLet me write this equation in terms of p. Let me denote x = p c. Then:\n\nsqrt( x\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 c^4 ) + x = m_pi c\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract x from both sides:\n\nsqrt( x\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 c^4 ) = (m_pi c\u00b2 - x )\n\nNow square both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 c^4 = (m_pi c\u00b2 - x )\u00b2\n= m_pi\u00b2 c^4 - 2 m_pi c\u00b2 x + x\u00b2\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\nm_mu\u00b2 c^4 = m_pi\u00b2 c^4 - 2 m_pi c\u00b2 x\n\nRearranging:\n\n2 m_pi c\u00b2 x = m_pi\u00b2 c^4 - m_mu\u00b2 c^4\n\nx = [ (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2 ) c^4 ] / ( 2 m_pi c\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = [ (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2 ) c^2 ] / (2 m_pi )\n\nSo, x = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) ] c^2 / (2 m_pi )\n\nBut wait, x is p c, so p = x / c.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute x in MeV units, considering c=1 in these units. Since the masses are given in MeV/c\u00b2, but when multiplied by c\u00b2, they become MeV.\n\nSo, substituting the numbers:\n\nm_pi = 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2\nm_mu = 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ (139.6^2 - 105.7^2 ) ] / ( 2 * 139.6 ) MeV\n\nCalculate numerator: 139.6^2 = approx 139^2 is 19321, but let's compute more accurately.\n\n139.6 * 139.6: Let me compute 140 *140 = 19600, but subtract 0.4 * (2*140 -0.4) = 0.4*(280 -0.4)= 0.4*279.6=111.84. So 19600 - 111.84 = 19488.16? Wait, maybe I should just calculate it as (a-b)(a+b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nWait, 139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = (139.6 -105.7)(139.6 +105.7) = (33.9)(245.3) = ?\n\n33.9 * 245.3:\n\n33 * 245 = 33*200=6600, 33*45=1485 \u2192 total 8085.\n\n0.9 * 245.3 = 220.77.\n\nSo, total is 8085 + 220.77 = 8305.77 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo, x = 8305.77 / (2 * 139.6 ) = 8305.77 / 279.2 \u2248 let me compute.\n\n279.2 * 29 = 8096.8, because 279.2 *30=8376, which is too high. So 29 * 279.2=279.2*20=5584, plus 279.2*9=2512.8 \u2192 total 5584 +2512.8=8096.8.\n\nThe numerator is 8305.77, so 8305.77 -8096.8 = 208.97. So 208.97 /279.2 \u2248 0.748.\n\nSo x \u2248 29.748 MeV.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait: x is in MeV, because when we compute (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) in (MeV^2/c^4), multiplied by c^4, but we've treated c=1 in these units, so it's MeV.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I may have messed up the units.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) meson decays. The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, nu is a neutrino, right?\n\nThe given information is that the Pi(+) is stationary, and its rest mass is 139.6 MeV. The mu(+) has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. The options are for the kinetic energies of the products, so I need to figure out how much energy each has after the decay.\n\nI remember that in particle decays, the energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the Pi is initially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu, which implies their magnitudes are the same.\n\nLet me think about the energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the Pi, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nThe energy of each particle is the sum of their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. So, E_mu = m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu, and E_nu = p_nu c + K_nu (since the neutrino is massless, assuming it's a charged current interaction, but wait, neutrinos have mass but maybe here we treat them as massless for simplicity? Or maybe the rest mass is negligible. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but since the muon has a rest mass given, perhaps the neutrino's mass is considered zero here. Let me proceed with that assumption unless I hit a contradiction.)\n\nWait, but if the neutrino has mass, that complicates things. The problem doesn't give the neutrino's rest mass, so maybe it's intended to treat it as massless. So, for the neutrino, E_nu = p_nu c, and since it's massless, the rest mass term is zero.\n\nSo, the energy conservation equation would be:\n\nm_pi c\u00b2 = E_mu + E_nu\nWhich is:\n139.6 MeV = (m_mu c\u00b2 + K_mu) + (p_nu c + K_nu)\n\nBut since the momenta are equal and opposite, p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude). Wait, but wait, the muon has mass, so p_mu = gamma m_mu v, and the neutrino's momentum is p_nu = E_nu / c\u00b2 * v_nu, but I might be getting tangled here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using four-momentum would be better. The invariant mass squared s is equal to (E_total)^2 - (p_total)^2 c\u00b2. But since the Pi is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero, so s = (m_pi c\u00b2)^2.\n\nAfter decay, the invariant mass squared should be (E_mu + E_nu)^2 - (p_mu c + p_nu c)^2. Since p_mu = -p_nu, the momentum terms add to zero. So, s is (E_mu + E_nu)^2 - (0)^2 = (m_pi c\u00b2)^2. So, that's consistent with energy and momentum conservation.\n\nWait, but that doesn't directly help me find the kinetic energies. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nLet me think about the decay in the rest frame of the Pi. The decay products must have equal and opposite momenta, so p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), but opposite in direction.\n\nThe total energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p_nu c. Since p_mu = p_nu, let's let p = p_mu = p_nu.\n\nSo, E_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 c^4 ), and E_nu = p c.\n\nThe total energy is E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 c^4 ) + p c = m_pi c\u00b2.\n\nLet me write this equation in terms of p. Let me denote x = p c. Then:\n\nsqrt( x\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 c^4 ) + x = m_pi c\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract x from both sides:\n\nsqrt( x\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 c^4 ) = (m_pi c\u00b2 - x )\n\nNow square both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 c^4 = (m_pi c\u00b2 - x )\u00b2\n= m_pi\u00b2 c^4 - 2 m_pi c\u00b2 x + x\u00b2\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\nm_mu\u00b2 c^4 = m_pi\u00b2 c^4 - 2 m_pi c\u00b2 x\n\nRearranging:\n\n2 m_pi c\u00b2 x = m_pi\u00b2 c^4 - m_mu\u00b2 c^4\n\nx = [ (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2 ) c^4 ] / ( 2 m_pi c\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = [ (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2 ) c^2 ] / (2 m_pi )\n\nSo, x = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) ] c^2 / (2 m_pi )\n\nBut wait, x is p c, so p = x / c.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute x in MeV units, considering c=1 in these units. Since the masses are given in MeV/c\u00b2, but when multiplied by c\u00b2, they become MeV.\n\nSo, substituting the numbers:\n\nm_pi = 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2\nm_mu = 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ (139.6^2 - 105.7^2 ) ] / ( 2 * 139.6 ) MeV\n\nCalculate numerator: 139.6^2 = approx 139^2 is 19321, but let's compute more accurately.\n\n139.6 * 139.6: Let me compute 140 *140 = 19600, but subtract 0.4 * (2*140 -0.4) = 0.4*(280 -0.4)= 0.4*279.6=111.84. So 19600 - 111.84 = 19488.16? Wait, maybe I should just calculate it as (a-b)(a+b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nWait, 139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = (139.6 -105.7)(139.6 +105.7) = (33.9)(245.3) = ?\n\n33.9 * 245.3:\n\n33 * 245 = 33*200=6600, 33*45=1485 \u2192 total 8085.\n\n0.9 * 245.3 = 220.77.\n\nSo, total is 8085 + 220.77 = 8305.77 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo, x = 8305.77 / (2 * 139.6 ) = 8305.77 / 279.2 \u2248 let me compute.\n\n279.2 * 29 = 8096.8, because 279.2 *30=8376, which is too high. So 29 * 279.2=279.2*20=5584, plus 279.2*9=2512.8 \u2192 total 5584 +2512.8=8096.8.\n\nThe numerator is 8305.77, so 8305.77 -8096.8 = 208.97. So 208.97 /279.2 \u2248 0.748.\n\nSo x \u2248 29.748 MeV.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait: x is in MeV, because when we compute (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) in (MeV^2/c^4), multiplied by c^4, but we've treated c=1 in these units, so it's MeV.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I may have messed up the units. Let me re-express.\n\nWait, in the equation:\n\nx = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) c^2 ] / (2 m_pi )\n\nBut m_pi and m_mu are in MeV/c\u00b2, so when you square them, you get MeV\u00b2/c^4. Multiply by c^4 to get MeV\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should better think in terms of natural units where c=1. So, in that case, m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV, and the equation becomes:\n\nx = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi )\n\nSo,\n\nx = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6 )\n\nCompute numerator: 139.6^2 is (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.\n\n105.7^2: Let's compute 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, 2*100*5.7=1140 \u2192 (100+5.7)^2=10000 +1140 +32.49=11172.49.\n\nSo, numerator is 19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67.\n\nDivide by (2 *139.6)=279.2.\n\n8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let me compute.\n\n279.2 *29= 8096.8 \u2192 as before. 8315.67-8096.8=218.87.\n\n218.87 / 279.2 \u2248 0.782.\n\nSo 29.782 \u2192 approx 29.78 MeV.\n\nSo x is approximately 29.78 MeV.\n\nWait, but x is p c, so p = x/c \u2192 but in units where c=1, p is in MeV/c, so x is p c \u2192 so p is 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nSo, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c = x =29.78 MeV.\n\nThe muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) \u2192 which in natural units is sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ).\n\np is 29.78 MeV/c, so in units where c=1, p is 29.78 MeV.\n\nSo, E_mu = sqrt(29.78^2 +105.7^2 )\n\nCompute 29.78^2: approx 886.8 (since 30^2=900, so 29.78^2 is about 886.8).\n\n105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.\n\nSo, 886.8 +11172.49 = 12059.29.\n\nsqrt(12059.29) \u2248 109.81 MeV.\n\nWait, but the Pi's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, so E_mu + E_nu = 109.81 + 29.78 \u2248 139.59 MeV, which is close to 139.6 MeV, so that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the muon's total energy is about 109.81 MeV, and its rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c^2 \u2192 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV, and since it's (assumed) massless, its kinetic energy is the same as its total energy, so K_nu =29.78 MeV.\n\nWait, but the problem says 'find KE of product particles'.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nThe problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are about the kinetic energies of the products, mu and nu. Wait, but neutrinos are neutral, right? So in this decay, we have a muon and a neutrino.\n\nWait, but neutrinos are very light. Do I consider their mass here? The problem doesn't specify the neutrino's rest mass, so maybe I can assume it's negligible. That would make things easier because then the neutrino's energy would be almost entirely kinetic.\n\nSince the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So p_mu = -p_nu. But if the neutrino's mass is negligible, then its energy is just p_nu c, right? Because E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) and if m is zero, E = pc.\n\nWait, but in the pion's rest frame, the total energy must be conserved. The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion, since it's stationary. So the initial energy is E_initial = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.\n\nThe final energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So E_final = E_mu + E_nu.\n\nE_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is gamma m_mu c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Similarly, E_nu is the energy of the neutrino, which is just p_nu c (since m_nu is zero).\n\nBut since momentum is conserved, p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude, opposite in direction). So p_mu = p_nu = p.\n\nSo, the total energy equation is:\nm_pi c^2 = (gamma m_mu c^2) + (p c)\n\nBut I can write p as gamma m_mu v, since p = gamma m v. Alternatively, since p^2 c^2 = (gamma^2 m^2 c^2) (v^2) ), but maybe it's easier to express in terms of gamma.\n\nWait, another approach: since p = gamma m v, and for the muon, we can relate p and gamma. Let me think.\n\nThe muon's energy is E_mu = gamma m_mu c^2. Its momentum is p = gamma m_mu v. But v can be expressed in terms of beta (v = beta c). So p = gamma m_mu beta c.\n\nWe also know that for any particle, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So for the muon, (gamma m_mu c^2)^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2.\n\nBut since p = gamma m_mu beta c, substituting into the equation:\n\n(gamma m_mu c^2)^2 = (gamma m_mu beta c^2)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2.\n\nDividing both sides by (m_mu c^2)^2:\n\ngamma^2 = gamma^2 beta^2 + 1.\n\nWe can factor out gamma^2:\n\ngamma^2 (1 - beta^2) = 1.\n\nBut 1 - beta^2 is 1/(gamma^2), so that equation becomes gamma^2 * (1/(gamma^2)) ) = 1, which is 1=1. Hmm, that's a tautology, so maybe that's not helpful.\n\nLet me get back to the initial energy conservation equation.\n\nm_pi c^2 = E_mu + E_nu.\n\nE_mu = gamma m_mu c^2.\n\nE_nu = p c, since m_nu is negligible.\n\nSo:\n\nm_pi c^2 = gamma m_mu c^2 + p c.\n\nBut p is the magnitude of the muon's momentum, which is p = gamma m_mu v.\n\nSo substituting that in:\n\nm_pi c^2 = gamma m_mu c^2 + (gamma m_mu v) c.\n\nHmm, but v is beta c, so v = beta c.\n\nSo p = gamma m_mu beta c.\n\nSo E_nu = p c = gamma m_mu beta c^2.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nm_pi c^2 = gamma m_mu c^2 + gamma m_mu beta c^2.\n\nFactor out gamma m_mu c^2 on the right:\n\nm_pi = gamma m_mu (1 + beta).\n\nSo, solving for gamma:\n\ngamma = m_pi / [ m_mu (1 + beta) ].\n\nBut I also know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).\n\nSo,\n\n1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = m_pi / [ m_mu (1 + beta) ]\n\nHmm, let's square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\n1/(1 - beta^2) = [ m_pi^2 ] / [ m_mu^2 (1 + beta)^2 ]\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - beta^2)(1 + beta)^2) to eliminate denominators:\n\n(1 + beta)^2 = [ m_pi^2 (1 - beta^2) ] / m_mu^2.\n\nBut 1 - beta^2 = (1 - beta)(1 + beta), so:\n\n(1 + beta)^2 = [ m_pi^2 (1 - beta)(1 + beta) ] / m_mu^2.\n\nDivide both sides by (1 + beta):\n\n1 + beta = [ m_pi^2 (1 - beta) ] / m_mu^2.\n\nMultiply both sides by m_mu^2:\n\nm_mu^2 (1 + beta) = m_pi^2 (1 - beta).\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nm_mu^2 + m_mu^2 beta = m_pi^2 - m_pi^2 beta.\n\nBring all terms with beta to one side:\n\nm_mu^2 beta + m_pi^2 beta = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2.\n\nFactor beta:\n\nbeta (m_mu^2 + m_pi^2) = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2.\n\nSo,\n\nbeta = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (m_mu^2 + m_pi^2).\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me plug in the numbers.\n\nm_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.\n\nCompute numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.\n\nLet me calculate each square:\n\n139.6^2 = approximately (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 \u2248 19488.16.\n\n105.7^2: 105^2 is 11025. Then 0.7^2 is 0.49, and 2*105*0.7=147. So (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo numerator: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nDenominator: 19488.16 + 11172.49 = 30660.65.\n\nSo beta \u2248 8315.67 / 30660.65 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by, say, 1000: 8.31567 / 30.66065 \u2248 0.2713.\n\nSo beta \u2248 0.2713.\n\nNow, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).\n\nCompute beta squared: (0.2713)^2 \u2248 0.0736.\n\nSo 1 - beta^2 = 0.9264.\n\nsqrt(0.9264) \u2248 0.9625.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1 / 0.9625 \u2248 1.0389.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.0389.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the muon is (gamma - 1) m_mu c^2.\n\nSo KE_mu = (1.0389 - 1) * 105.7 MeV.\n\n1.0389 - 1 = 0.0389.\n\n0.0389 * 105.7 \u2248 Let's compute:\n\n105.7 * 0.0389.\n\n105.7 * 0.03 = 3.171.\n\n105.7 * 0.0089 \u2248 0.94153.\n\nSum: 3.171 + 0.94153 \u2248 4.1125 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I calculated beta, I used m_pi and m_mu in MeV, but those are their rest masses. Wait, but in the equation, I used m_pi^2 - m_mu^2, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the equation for beta, I have beta = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (m_pi^2 + m_mu^2).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I plugged in the numbers, I think I messed up the calculations. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 139.6 squared is 139.6 * 139.6.\n\nLet me compute 139^2: 19321.\n\n0.6^2 is 0.36.\n\n2 * 139 * 0.6 = 166.8.\n\nSo 139.6^2 = (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6^2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16.\n\nYes, correct.\n\n105.7^2: Let me compute 105 *105 = 11025.\n\n0.7^2 = 0.49.\n\n2 * 105 * 0.7 = 147.\n\nSo 105.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nDenominator is 19488.16 + 11172.49 = 30660.65.\n\n8315.67 / 30660.65 \u2248 let's compute this as:\n\n8315.67 \u00f7 30660.65 \u2248 approximately 0.2713, as before.\n\nSo beta is approximately 0.2713.\n\nThen gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2713)^2) \u2248 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.0736) = 1/sqrt(0.9264) \u2248 1/0.9625 \u2248 1.0389.\n\nSo KE_mu = (gamma - 1) * m_mu c^2 = (0.0389) * 105.7 MeV.\n\n0.0389 * 105.7 = Let me compute:\n\n0.03 * 105.7 = 3.171.\n\n0.0089 * 105.7 \u2248 0.9415.\n\nAdding them gives 4.1125 MeV.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo the muon's KE is about 4.12 MeV, matching option D.\n\nWait, but what about the neutrino's KE? Because the muon's KE is about 4.12 MeV, but the neutrino's KE would be E_nu - m_mu c^2? Wait no, E_nu is the neutrino's energy, which is kinetic plus rest mass, but since neutrino's rest mass is negligible, E_nu is approximately its kinetic energy.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, we have E_nu = p c, which is also equal to gamma m_mu beta c^2.\n\nWait, let me compute E_nu.\n\nFrom earlier, E_nu = p c = gamma m_mu beta c^2.\n\nWe have gamma as 1.0389, beta as 0.2713.\n\nSo gamma * beta = 1.0389 * 0.2713 \u2248 0.2824.\n\nSo E_nu = 0.2824 * m_mu c^2 = 0.2824 * 105.7 MeV.\n\n0.2824 * 100 =28.24, 0.2824 *5.7=1.61 MeV. So total \u2248 29.85 MeV.\n\nSo the neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately 29.85 MeV, which would match option D's second value of 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo the KEs are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which matches.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem states that the neutrino is a product. So in the decay, the muon and neutrino are emitted in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So their kinetic energies would be as calculated.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option D.\n",

Hmm, that's a tautology, so maybe that's not helpful.\n\nLet me get back to the initial energy conservation equation.\n\nm_pi c^2 = E_mu + E_nu.\n\nE_mu = gamma m_mu c^2.\n\nE_nu = p c, since m_nu is negligible.\n\nSo:\n\nm_pi c^2 = gamma m_mu c^2 + p c.\n\nBut p is the magnitude of the muon's momentum, which is p = gamma m_mu v.\n\nSo substituting that in:\n\nm_pi c^2 = gamma m_mu c^2 + (gamma m_mu v) c.\n\nHmm, but v is beta c, so v = beta c.\n\nSo p = gamma m_mu beta c.\n\nSo E_nu = p c = gamma m_mu beta c^2.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nm_pi c^2 = gamma m_mu c^2 + gamma m_mu beta c^2.\n\nFactor out gamma m_mu c^2 on the right:\n\nm_pi = gamma m_mu (1 + beta).\n\nSo, solving for gamma:\n\ngamma = m_pi / [ m_mu (1 + beta) ].\n\nBut I also know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).\n\nSo,\n\n1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = m_pi / [ m_mu (1 + beta) ]\n\nHmm, let's square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\n1/(1 - beta^2) = [ m_pi^2 ] / [ m_mu^2 (1 + beta)^2 ]\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - beta^2)(1 + beta)^2) to eliminate denominators:\n\n(1 + beta)^2 = [ m_pi^2 (1 - beta^2) ] / m_mu^2.\n\nBut 1 - beta^2 = (1 - beta)(1 + beta), so:\n\n(1 + beta)^2 = [ m_pi^2 (1 - beta)(1 + beta) ] / m_mu^2.\n\nDivide both sides by (1 + beta):\n\n1 + beta = [ m_pi^2 (1 - beta) ] / m_mu^2.\n\nMultiply both sides by m_mu^2:\n\nm_mu^2 (1 + beta) = m_pi^2 (1 - beta).\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nm_mu^2 + m_mu^2 beta = m_pi^2 - m_pi^2 beta.\n\nBring all terms with beta to one side:\n\nm_mu^2 beta + m_pi^2 beta = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2.\n\nFactor beta:\n\nbeta (m_mu^2 + m_pi^2) = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2.\n\nSo,\n\nbeta = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (m_mu^2 + m_pi^2).\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me plug in the numbers.\n\nm_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.\n\nCompute numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.\n\nLet me calculate each square:\n\n139.6^2 = approximately (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 \u2248 19488.16.\n\n105.7^2: 105^2 is 11025. Then 0.7^2 is 0.49, and 2*105*0.7=147. So (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo numerator: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nDenominator: 19488.16 + 11172.49 = 30660.65.\n\nSo beta \u2248 8315.67 / 30660.65 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by, say, 1000: 8.31567 / 30.66065 \u2248 0.2713.\n\nSo beta \u2248 0.2713.\n\nNow, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).\n\nCompute beta squared: (0.2713)^2 \u2248 0.0736.\n\nSo 1 - beta^2 = 0.9264.\n\nsqrt(0.9264) \u2248 0.9625.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1 / 0.9625 \u2248 1.0389.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.0389.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the muon is (gamma - 1) m_mu c^2.\n\nSo KE_mu = (1.0389 - 1) * 105.7 MeV.\n\n1.0389 - 1 = 0.0389.\n\n0.0389 * 105.7 \u2248 Let's compute:\n\n105.7 * 0.0389.\n\n105.7 * 0.03 = 3.171.\n\n105.7 * 0.0089 \u2248 0.94153.\n\nSum: 3.171 + 0.94153 \u2248 4.1125 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I calculated beta, I used m_pi and m_mu in MeV, but those are their rest masses. Wait, but in the equation, I used m_pi^2 - m_mu^2, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the equation for beta, I have beta = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (m_pi^2 + m_mu^2).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I plugged in the numbers, I think I messed up the calculations. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 139.6 squared is 139.6 * 139.6.\n\nLet me compute 139^2: 19321.\n\n0.6^2 is 0.36.\n\n2 * 139 * 0.6 = 166.8.\n\nSo 139.6^2 = (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6^2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16.\n\nYes, correct.\n\n105.7^2: Let me compute 105 *105 = 11025.\n\n0.7^2 = 0.49.\n\n2 * 105 * 0.7 = 147.\n\nSo 105.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nDenominator is 19488.16 + 11172.49 = 30660.65.\n\n8315.67 / 30660.65 \u2248 let's compute this as:\n\n8315.67 \u00f7 30660.65 \u2248 approximately 0.2713, as before.\n\nSo beta is approximately 0.2713.\n\nThen gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2713)^2) \u2248 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.0736) = 1/sqrt(0.9264) \u2248 1/0.9625 \u2248 1.0389.\n\nSo KE_mu = (gamma - 1) * m_mu c^2 = (0.0389) * 105.7 MeV.\n\n0.0389 * 105.7 = Let me compute:\n\n0.03 * 105.7 = 3.171.\n\n0.0089 * 105.7 \u2248 0.9415.\n\nAdding them gives 4.1125 MeV.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo the muon's KE is about 4.12 MeV, matching option D.\n\nWait, but what about the neutrino's KE? Because the muon's KE is about 4.12 MeV, but the neutrino's KE would be E_nu - m_mu c^2? Wait no, E_nu is the neutrino's energy, which is kinetic plus rest mass, but since neutrino's rest mass is negligible, E_nu is approximately its kinetic energy.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, we have E_nu = p c, which is also equal to gamma m_mu beta c^2.\n\nWait, let me compute E_nu.\n\nFrom earlier, E_nu = p c = gamma m_mu beta c^2.\n\nWe have gamma as 1.0389, beta as 0.2713.\n\nSo gamma * beta = 1.0389 * 0.2713 \u2248 0.2824.\n\nSo E_nu = 0.2824 * m_mu c^2 = 0.2824 * 105.7 MeV.\n\n0.2824 * 100 =28.24, 0.2824 *5.7=1.61 MeV. So total \u2248 29.85 MeV.\n\nSo the neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately 29.85 MeV, which would match option D's second value of 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo the KEs are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which matches.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem states that the neutrino is a product. So in the decay, the muon and neutrino are emitted in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So their kinetic energies would be as calculated.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option D.\n\n\nTo determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay of a stationary pion, we use energy and momentum conservation principles. The pion (rest mass \\( m_{\\pi} = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV} \\)) decays into a muon (rest mass \\( m_{\\mu} = 105.7 \\, \\text{MeV} \\)) and a neutrino (\\( m_{\\nu} \\approx 0 \\)). \n\n### Key Equations and Analysis:\n1. **Energy Conservation**:  \n   The total initial energy is the pion's rest energy, \\( E_{\\text{initial}} = m_{\\pi} c^2 \\). The final energy is the sum of the muon's total energy (\\( E_{\\mu} = \\gamma m_{\\mu} c^2 \\)) and the neutrino's energy (\\( E_{\\nu} = p c \\), since \\( m_{\\nu} \\approx 0 \\)).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me think about how to approach this. Hmm, the question says that a Pi-plus particle is at rest and decays into a mu-plus and a neutrino. Oh wait, but the reaction given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Wait, I think that's the pion decay: Pi+ \u2192 mu+ + nu_e or something like that. \n\nThe given data are the rest masses: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV, and mu+ is 105.7 MeV. The options are giving possible kinetic energies for the products. So I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nWait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny masses, almost zero. So in this case, since the neutrino is a product, its rest mass is negligible. So I can probably treat it as massless, which might simplify the calculations.\n\nSince the pion is initially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After decay, the total momentum must still be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That implies their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\n\nLet me recall the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nWait, the neutrino is a lepton, so it's treated as a relativistic particle. Its energy is just its momentum times c (but in units where c=1, which we're probably using here), so E_neutrino = p_neutrino * c. But since c is 1 in these units, E = p.\n\nThe muon has rest mass, so its energy will be the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy. So E_muon = m_mu*c\u00b2 + K_mu. \n\nWait, but since the pion is at rest, the total energy after decay is the sum of E_muon and E_neutrino, which should equal the pion's rest energy, 139.6 MeV. So:\n\nE_muon + E_neutrino = 139.6 MeV.\n\nBut E_muon = sqrt( (p_mu c\u00b2)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, in natural units where c=1, the energy E is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2), so E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2). Similarly, E_nu = p_nu (since m_nu \u2248 0).\n\nBut since momentum is conserved, p_mu = -p_nu. So their magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu|. Let's denote this magnitude as p.\n\nSo E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = sqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2), and E_nu = p.\n\nSo the total energy equation is:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6\n\nHmm, that's an equation in terms of p. Let's solve for p.\n\nLet me set x = p for simplicity. Then:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) + x = 139.6\n\nLet me subtract x from both sides:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) = 139.6 - x\n\nNow square both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2\n\nExpand the right side: 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6 x + x\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2 = 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6 x + x\u00b2\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n105.7\u00b2 = 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6 x\n\nNow, compute 105.7\u00b2 and 139.6\u00b2.\n\n105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let's see, 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 \u2248 11172.49. But let me just calculate it accurately:\n\n105.7 * 105.7:\n= (100 + 5.7)^2\n= 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2\n= 10000 + 1140 + 32.49\n= 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, 139.6^2: Let's compute that. 140^2 is 19600. But 139.6 is 140 - 0.4.\n\nSo (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo plug back into equation:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x\n\nRearranging:\n\n2*139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49\n= 19488.16 - 11172.49 = let's compute that.\n\n19488.16 minus 11172.49. Let's subtract:\n\n19488.16\n-11172.49\n= ?\n\n19488.16 - 11172 = 8316.16, and then subtract 0.49: 8316.16 - 0.49 = 8315.67 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n2*139.6 x = 8315.67\n\nx = 8315.67 / (2*139.6) \n\nCompute denominator: 2*139.6 = 279.2\n\nSo x \u2248 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\nDivide 8315.67 by 279.2:\n\nApproximate:\n\n279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376, minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8 \u2192 but 279.2 *29=8096.8. Our numerator is 8315.67, which is 8315.67-8096.8=218.87 more.\n\nSo 218.87 /279.2 \u2248 0.783.\n\nSo x\u224829.783 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm getting x as p \u224829.783 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8.\n\n8315.67-8096.8=218.87.\n\n218.87 / 279.2 \u2248 0.783.\n\nSo x=29.783 MeV/c.\n\nSo p \u224829.783 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but wait, the neutrino's energy is p, so E_nu = 29.783 MeV.\n\nNow, the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt(29.783^2 + 105.7^2).\n\nCompute 29.783^2: approx 29.783 *29.783.\n\nLet me compute 30^2 is 900. So 29.783 is 30 - 0.217. So (30 - 0.217)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.217 + (0.217)^2 = 900 - 13.02 + 0.047 \u2248 887.\n\nWait, exact value: 29.783^2.\n\n29.783 *29.783 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29 *29=841. 29 *0.783=22.707. 0.783 *29= same. 0.783^2\u22480.613.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute 29.783 *29.783:\n\n= (30 - 0.217) * (30 - 0.217) = 30^2 - 2*30*0.217 + 0.217^2.\n\n= 900 - 13.02 + 0.047 = 900-13.02=886.98 +0.047=887.027.\n\nSo approximately 887.027 MeV\u00b2.\n\nm_mu^2 is 105.7^2 =11172.49.\n\nSo sum is 887.027 + 11172.49 =12059.517.\n\nSquare root of 12059.517 is sqrt(12059.517). Let's see, 110^2=12100, which is about 12059.517. So sqrt(12059.517) is just a bit less than 110. Let me compute 109.8^2 = (110-0.2)^2=12100 -44 + 0.04=12056.04. Hmm, that's close.\n\nWait, 109.8^2=12056.04.\n\nOur target is 12059.517.\n\nSo 12056.04 is 109.8^2.\n\nThe difference is 12059.517 -12056.04=3.477.\n\nSo, (109.8 + x)^2 \u224812056.04 + 2*109.8 x + x\u00b2 =12056.04 + 219.6 x.\n\nSet equal to 12059.517:\n\n219.6 x \u22483.477 \u2192 x \u22483.477 /219.6 \u22480.01585.\n\nSo sqrt(12059.517) \u2248109.8 +0.01585\u2248109.81585.\n\nSo E_mu \u2248109.816 MeV.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation of E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)=sqrt(887.027 +11172.49)=sqrt(12059.517)\u2248109.816 MeV.\n\nSo the muon's energy is approximately 109.816 MeV.\n\nBut the muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV. So the kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu*c\u00b2. Since we're in MeV and c=1, it's E_mu - m_mu.\n\nSo K_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 =4.116 MeV. Approximately 4.12 MeV.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. Wait, the neutrino's energy is p, which is about 29.783 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo the kinetic energies would be K_mu \u22484.12 MeV and K_nu \u224829.8 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The neutrino is a massless particle, so its entire energy is kinetic. Because rest mass is zero, so E_nu = K_nu + m_nu c^2, but m_nu is zero, so K_nu = E_nu. So the neutrino's KE is 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe muon's KE is 4.12 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when you square, you might introduce extraneous solutions. But in this case, I think everything is correct. Also, the numbers make sense because the muon is much heavier, so it doesn't get much kinetic energy, while the neutrino gets most of the energy.\n\nAnother check: the total energy after decay should be 109.816 +29.783 \u2248139.599 MeV, which is close to 139.6 MeV, so that's correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me think about how to approach this. Hmm, the question says that a Pi-plus particle is at rest and decays into a mu-plus and a neutrino. Oh wait, but the reaction given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Wait, I think that's the pion decay: Pi+ \u2192 mu+ + nu_e or something like that. \n\nThe given data are the rest masses: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV, and mu+ is 105.7 MeV. The options are giving possible kinetic energies for the products. So I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nWait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny masses, almost zero. So in this case, since the neutrino is a product, its rest mass is negligible. So I can probably treat it as massless, which might simplify the calculations.\n\nSince the pion is initially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After decay, the total momentum must still be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That implies their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\n\nLet me recall the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nWait, the neutrino is a lepton, so it's treated as a relativistic particle. Its energy is just its momentum times c (but in units where c=1, which we're probably using here), so E_neutrino = p_neutrino * c. But since c is 1 in these units, E = p.\n\nThe muon has rest mass, so its energy will be the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy. So E_muon = m_mu*c\u00b2 + K_mu. \n\nWait, but since the pion is at rest, the total energy after decay is the sum of E_muon and E_neutrino, which should equal the pion's rest energy, 139.6 MeV. So:\n\nE_muon + E_neutrino = 139.6 MeV.\n\nBut E_muon = sqrt( (p_mu c\u00b2)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, in natural units where c=1, the energy E is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2), so E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2). Similarly, E_nu = p_nu (since m_nu \u2248 0).\n\nBut since momentum is conserved, p_mu = -p_nu. So their magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu|. Let's denote this magnitude as p.\n\nSo E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = sqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2), and E_nu = p.\n\nSo the total energy equation is:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6\n\nHmm, that's an equation in terms of p. Let's solve for p.\n\nLet me set x = p for simplicity. Then:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) + x = 139.6\n\nLet me subtract x from both sides:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) = 139.6 - x\n\nNow square both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2\n\nExpand the right side: 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6 x + x\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2 = 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6 x + x\u00b2\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n105.7\u00b2 = 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6 x\n\nNow, compute 105.7\u00b2 and 139.6\u00b2.\n\n105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let's see, 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 \u2248 11172.49. But let me just calculate it accurately:\n\n105.7 * 105.7:\n= (100 + 5.7)^2\n= 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2\n= 10000 + 1140 + 32.49\n= 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, 139.6^2: Let's compute that. 140^2 is 19600. But 139.6 is 140 - 0.4.\n\nSo (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo plug back into equation:\n\n11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x\n\nRearranging:\n\n2*139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49\n= 19488.16 - 11172.49 = let's compute that.\n\n19488.16 minus 11172.49. Let's subtract:\n\n19488.16\n-11172.49\n= ?\n\n19488.16 - 11172 = 8316.16, and then subtract 0.49: 8316.16 - 0.49 = 8315.67 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n2*139.6 x = 8315.67\n\nx = 8315.67 / (2*139.6) \n\nCompute denominator: 2*139.6 = 279.2\n\nSo x \u2248 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\nDivide 8315.67 by 279.2:\n\nApproximate:\n\n279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376, minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8 \u2192 but 279.2 *29=8096.8. Our numerator is 8315.67, which is 8315.67-8096.8=218.87 more.\n\nSo 218.87 /279.2 \u2248 0.783.\n\nSo x\u224829.783 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm getting x as p \u224829.783 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8.\n\n8315.67-8096.8=218.87.\n\n218.87 / 279.2 \u2248 0.783.\n\nSo x=29.783 MeV/c.\n\nSo p \u224829.783 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but wait, the neutrino's energy is p, so E_nu = 29.783 MeV.\n\nNow, the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt(29.783^2 + 105.7^2).\n\nCompute 29.783^2: approx 29.783 *29.783.\n\nLet me compute 30^2 is 900. So 29.783 is 30 - 0.217. So (30 - 0.217)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.217 + (0.217)^2 = 900 - 13.02 + 0.047 \u2248 887.\n\nWait, exact value: 29.783^2.\n\n29.783 *29.783 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29 *29=841. 29 *0.783=22.707. 0.783 *29= same. 0.783^2\u22480.613.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute 29.783 *29.783:\n\n= (30 - 0.217) * (30 - 0.217) = 30^2 - 2*30*0.217 + 0.217^2.\n\n= 900 - 13.02 + 0.047 = 900-13.02=886.98 +0.047=887.027.\n\nSo approximately 887.027 MeV\u00b2.\n\nm_mu^2 is 105.7^2 =11172.49.\n\nSo sum is 887.027 + 11172.49 =12059.517.\n\nSquare root of 12059.517 is sqrt(12059.517). Let's see, 110^2=12100, which is about 12059.517. So sqrt(12059.517) is just a bit less than 110. Let me compute 109.8^2 = (110-0.2)^2=12100 -44 + 0.04=12056.04. Hmm, that's close.\n\nWait, 109.8^2=12056.04.\n\nOur target is 12059.517.\n\nSo 12056.04 is 109.8^2.\n\nThe difference is 12059.517 -12056.04=3.477.\n\nSo, (109.8 + x)^2 \u224812056.04 + 2*109.8 x + x\u00b2 =12056.04 + 219.6 x.\n\nSet equal to 12059.517:\n\n219.6 x \u22483.477 \u2192 x \u22483.477 /219.6 \u22480.01585.\n\nSo sqrt(12059.517) \u2248109.8 +0.01585\u2248109.81585.\n\nSo E_mu \u2248109.816 MeV.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation of E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)=sqrt(887.027 +11172.49)=sqrt(12059.517)\u2248109.816 MeV.\n\nSo the muon's energy is approximately 109.816 MeV.\n\nBut the muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV. So the kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu*c\u00b2. Since we're in MeV and c=1, it's E_mu - m_mu.\n\nSo K_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 =4.116 MeV. Approximately 4.12 MeV.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. Wait, the neutrino's energy is p, which is about 29.783 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo the kinetic energies would be K_mu \u22484.12 MeV and K_nu \u224829.8 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The neutrino is a massless particle, so its entire energy is kinetic. Because rest mass is zero, so E_nu = K_nu + m_nu c^2, but m_nu is zero, so K_nu = E_nu. So the neutrino's KE is 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe muon's KE is 4.12 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when you square, you might introduce extraneous solutions. But in this case, I think everything is correct. Also, the numbers make sense because the muon is much heavier, so it doesn't get much kinetic energy, while the neutrino gets most of the energy.\n\nAnother check: the total energy after decay should be 109.816 +29.783 \u2248139.599 MeV, which is close to 139.6 MeV, so that's correct.\n\n\nTo determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay process:\n\n**Reaction:**  \n\\[\n\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu\n\\]  \nGiven:  \n- Rest mass of \\(\\pi^+\\): \\(139.6 \\, \\text{MeV}\\)  \n- Rest mass of \\(\\mu^+\\): \\(105.7 \\, \\text{MeV}\\)  \n- Neutrino mass is negligible (\\(m_\\nu \\approx 0\\))  \n\n### Key Conservation Laws:\n1. **Energy Conservation:**  \n   \\[\n   E_{\\pi^+} = E_{\\mu^+} + E_\\nu\n   \\]  \n   The total energy of the pion is its rest energy:  \n   \\[\n   E_{\\pi^+} = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV}\n   \\]  \n\n2. **Momentum Conservation:**  \n   Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after the decay must be zero.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me see what I remember about this. So the reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle is at rest and decays, the total momentum of the products must be zero because momentum is conserved. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.\n\nThe given masses are Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. Oh wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, but in this case, I think the problem is treating the neutrino as massless, or maybe it's using some approximation. Let me think. The problem says \"nu\" which is a neutrino. So if the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the others, I can treat it as massless, which might simplify the calculations.\n\nSo, the total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energies of the muon and the neutrino must add up to this. Also, the muon will have kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, and the neutrino will have energy equal to its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible).\n\nLet me denote the energy of the muon as E_mu and the neutrino as E_nu. So E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.\n\nNow, considering momentum conservation. The pion is at rest, so the total momentum after decay is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p, and the neutrino's as p' = p (but opposite direction). So the magnitudes are the same.\n\nThe energy of each particle can be found using E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2. But since we're working in units where c=1 (as in MeV and MeV/c\u00b2), it simplifies to E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m\u00b2.\n\nFor the muon: E_mu\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nFor the neutrino: E_nu\u00b2 = p'^2. But since p' is the same magnitude as p (but opposite direction), E_nu = p.\n\nSo, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.\n\nHmm, so substituting E_nu = p into the equation: E_mu + p = 139.6.\n\nAlso, from the muon's energy equation: E_mu\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nI can substitute p = 139.6 - E_mu into the second equation.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nE_mu\u00b2 = (139.6 - E_mu)^2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n= (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*E_mu + E_mu^2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nSo, E_mu\u00b2 = (139.6\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) - 2*139.6*E_mu + E_mu\u00b2.\n\nWait, subtracting E_mu\u00b2 from both sides gives:\n\n0 = (139.6\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) - 2*139.6*E_mu.\n\nSo, 2*139.6*E_mu = 139.6\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n139.6 squared is approximately (140)^2=19600, but more accurately:\n\n139.6 * 139.6 = let's see, (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, 105.7 squared: 105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 10000 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nAdding them together: 19488.16 + 11172.49 = 30660.65 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo, 2*139.6 * E_mu = 30660.65.\n\nCalculate 2*139.6 = 279.2.\n\nSo E_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\n30660.65 / 279.2 \u2248 let's see: 279.2 * 100 = 27920, which is less than 30660.65. So 30660.65 -27920 = 2740.65. Now 279.2 *9 = 2512.8, which is less than 2740.65. So 9 *279.2 = 2512.8. Remaining is 2740.65-2512.8 = 227.85. 227.85 / 279.2 \u2248 ~0.816.\n\nSo total E_mu \u2248 100 + 9 + 0.816 \u2248 109.816 MeV.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Because the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so if E_mu is about 109.8 MeV, then the kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 -105.7 = 4.1 MeV.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again. Because I think I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, the equation I had was:\n\nE_mu + p = 139.6.\n\nAnd E_mu\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nLet me try substituting p = 139.6 - E_mu into the second equation.\n\nSo,\n\nE_mu\u00b2 = (139.6 - E_mu)^2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*E_mu + E_mu\u00b2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nE_mu\u00b2 = (139.6\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) - 2*139.6*E_mu + E_mu\u00b2.\n\nSubtract E_mu\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n0 = (139.6\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) - 2*139.6*E_mu.\n\nSo, 2*139.6 * E_mu = 139.6\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2.\n\nWhich is the same as before. So the calculation should be correct.\n\nSo,\n\nE_mu \u2248 (19488.16 + 11172.49) / (2 *139.6 )\n\nWait, 19488.16 + 11172.49 = 30660.65.\n\nDivided by 2*139.6 = 279.2.\n\n30660.65 / 279.2 \u2248 let me compute it more accurately.\n\n279.2 * 109 = ?\n\n279.2 * 100 = 27920.\n\n279.2 *9 = 2512.8 \u2192 27920 +2512.8=30432.8.\n\nWait, 279.2 *109 = 27920 + (279.2 *9) = 27920 + 2512.8 = 30432.8.\n\nBut 30660.65 is 30660.65 -30432.8 = 227.85 more.\n\nSo 227.85 /279.2 \u2248 0.816.\n\nSo E_mu \u2248 109.816 MeV.\n\nSo the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.816 -105.7 = 4.116 MeV, approximately 4.12 MeV.\n\nHmm, looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me see what I remember about this. So the reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle is at rest and decays, the total momentum of the products must be zero because momentum is conserved. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.\n\nThe given masses are Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. Oh wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, but in this case, I think the problem is treating the neutrino as massless, or maybe it's using some approximation. Let me think. The problem says \"nu\" which is a neutrino. So if the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the others, I can treat it as massless, which might simplify the calculations.\n\nSo, the total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energies of the muon and the neutrino must add up to this. Also, the muon will have kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, and the neutrino will have energy equal to its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible).\n\nLet me denote the energy of the muon as E_mu and the neutrino as E_nu. So E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.\n\nNow, considering momentum conservation. The pion is at rest, so the total momentum after decay is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p, and the neutrino's as p' = p (but opposite direction). So the magnitudes are the same.\n\nThe energy of each particle can be found using E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2. But since we're working in units where c=1 (as in MeV and MeV/c\u00b2), it simplifies to E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m\u00b2.\n\nFor the muon: E_mu\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nFor the neutrino: E_nu\u00b2 = p'^2. But since p' is the same magnitude as p (but opposite direction), E_nu = p.\n\nSo, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.\n\nHmm, so substituting E_nu = p into the equation: E_mu + p = 139.6.\n\nAlso, from the muon's energy equation: E_mu\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nI can substitute p = 139.6 - E_mu into the second equation.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nE_mu\u00b2 = (139.6 - E_mu)^2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n= (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*E_mu + E_mu^2 + (105.7)^2.\n\nSo, E_mu\u00b2 = (139.6\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) - 2*139.6*E_mu + E_mu\u00b2.\n\nWait, subtracting E_mu\u00b2 from both sides gives:\n\n0 = (139.6\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) - 2*139.6*E_mu.\n\nSo, 2*139.6*E_mu = 139.6\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n139.6 squared is approximately (140)^2=19600, but more accurately:\n\n139.6 * 139.6 = let's see, (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, 105.7 squared: 105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 10000 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV\u00b2.\n\nAdding them together: 19488.16 + 11172.49 = 30660.65 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSo, 2*139.6 * E_mu = 30660.65.\n\nCalculate 2*139.6 = 279.2.\n\nSo E_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\n30660.65 / 279.2 \u2248 let's see: 279.2 * 100 = 27920, which is less than 30660.65.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, which I think is written as nu. So the equation is Pi(+) \u2192 mu(+) + nu. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle is at rest and decays, energy and momentum must be conserved. Oh right, because momentum is a vector, but since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum after decay should be zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.\n\nWait, but neutrinos are tricky. They have very little mass, right? I think they're considered massless in some approximations, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh, wait, in reality neutrinos do have some mass, but for problems like this, maybe we can assume they're massless. Or does it matter here?\n\nThe given data: the rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. I guess the neutrino's rest mass is negligible here because it's not provided, so we can treat it as zero.\n\nSo the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's denote the muon's momentum as p, so the neutrino's momentum is -p. But wait, in terms of magnitude, they have the same p. \n\nBut wait, the neutrino's momentum is in the opposite direction. So when I calculate energies, I'll need to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\nLet me think about the energies. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nThe muon's energy will be sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2. Wait, no, the units here are in MeV, so maybe I should just use the natural units where c=1. So the energy of the muon would be sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), where p is in MeV/c, but since we're using c=1, p is in MeV. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused with the units, but perhaps I can proceed without worrying about it.\n\nThe neutrino's energy would be just p, since its mass is zero. So the total energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.\n\nThis total energy should equal the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. So:\n\nsqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6\n\nHmm, that looks like an equation I can solve for p. Let me denote m_mu as m, so m=105.7.\n\nSo equation is sqrt(p^2 + m^2) + p = M, where M is 139.6.\n\nLet me rearrange this. Let's subtract p from both sides:\n\nsqrt(p^2 + m^2) = M - p\n\nThen square both sides:\n\np^2 + m^2 = (M - p)^2 = M^2 - 2 M p + p^2\n\nSubtract p^2 from both sides:\n\nm^2 = M^2 - 2 M p\n\nRearranging:\n\n2 M p = M^2 - m^2\n\nSo p = (M^2 - m^2) / (2 M)\n\nLet me compute that. M is 139.6, m is 105.7.\n\nM^2 is (139.6)^2. Let me calculate that. 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6^2 is approximately (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.\n\nm^2 is (105.7)^2. Let's compute that. 100^2 is 10,000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and cross terms are 2*100*5.7=1140. So (105.7)^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo M^2 - m^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nThen 2 M p = 8315.67 \u2192 p = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6 )\n\nCalculate denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.\n\np = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\nWell, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So 279.2 * 29.78 \u2248 8315. Let me compute 279.2 * 29.78.\n\nWait, 279.2 * 29 is 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8. Hmm, that's not right. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.\n\nLet me approximate 279.2 \u00d7 29.78.\n\nWait, 279.2 * 29.78 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps I can just compute 8315.67 \u00f7 279.2.\n\nLet me do this division.\n\n279.2 * 30 = 8376 \u2192 which is a bit more than 8315.67.\n\nSo 279.2 * 29.8 \u2192 279.2*(30 -0.2) = 8376 - (279.2 * 0.2) = 8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16.\n\nHmm, that's very close to 8315.67. So 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is a bit higher. So perhaps 29.78.\n\nWait, let me compute 279.2 *29.78.\n\nWell, 279.2 \u00d7 29 = 279.2 * 30 =8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8.\n\nWait, no, wait, 279.2 \u00d729 = 279.2 * (30-1) = 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8.\n\nThen, 0.78 \u00d7 279.2 is 0.78 *279.2. Let me compute that:\n\n0.7 *279.2=195.44\n\n0.08*279.2=22.336 \u2192 sum is 195.44 +22.336=217.776\n\nSo 29.78 \u00d7279.2 = 8096.8 +217.776 = 8314.576.\n\nWait, that's very close to 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 -8314.576=1.094.\n\nSo 1.094 / 279.2 \u2248 0.0039. So the total p is approximately 29.78 + 0.0039 \u2248 29.7839.\n\nSo p \u224829.784 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a miscalculation earlier because the neutrino's energy is p, and the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). So the muon's energy is sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).\n\nWait, but let me proceed step by step.\n\nWait, I think the calculation for p is correct. So p \u224829.78 MeV/c.\n\nNow, the muon's energy is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) \u2192 compute that.\n\n29.78^2 is about (30)^2=900, but a bit less. 29.78^2 = approx 886.8.\n\nWait, 29.78 *29.78: 30*30=900. Subtract (0.22)*2*30 + (0.22)^2 \u2192 0.22^2 is 0.0484. So 29.78^2 = 900 - (13.2) + 0.0484 \u2192 900-13.2 is 886.8, plus 0.0484 \u2192 886.8484.\n\n105.7^2 is 11172.49 as calculated earlier.\n\nSo sum is 886.8484 + 11172.49 = 12059.3384.\n\nsqrt(12059.3384) = approximately 109.81 MeV.\n\nWait, because 109^2 is 11881, 110^2 is 12100. So sqrt(12059) is about 109.8.\n\nSo the muon's energy is about 109.8 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino's energy is p \u224829.78 MeV.\n\nWait, but the pion's rest energy is 139.6 MeV. Let me check the sum: 109.8 +29.78 =139.58, which is about 139.6, so that checks out.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of each particle is their total energy minus their rest mass energy.\n\nSo for the muon: KE_mu = Energy_mu - m_mu c\u00b2 = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV =4.1 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait, in natural units, energy is in MeV, and m_mu is 105.7 MeV. So yes, 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino's rest mass is zero, so its KE is equal to its energy, which is p \u224829.78 MeV.\n\nSo the KEs are approximately 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I got.\n\nWait, but let me recheck my calculations for more precise numbers.\n\nWait, when I calculated p, I got p= (139.6^2 -105.7^2)/(2 *139.6) \u2192 which is (19488.16 -11172.49)/(279.2) \u2192 (8315.67)/(279.2) \u2192 let's compute this more accurately.\n\nCompute 8315.67 \u00f7 279.2:\n\nLet me do this division with more precision.\n\n279.2 \u00d7 29.78 = 8314.576, as before. The difference is 8315.67 -8314.576=1.094.\n\nSo 1.094 /279.2 = approximately 0.003919.\n\nSo p \u224829.78 +0.003919 \u224829.7839 MeV.\n\nSo p \u224829.7839 MeV/c.\n\nSo the neutrino's KE is 29.7839 MeV.\n\nMuon's energy: sqrt( (29.7839)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) \u2192 compute 29.7839^2:\n\n29.7839^2 = (29.78)^2 + 2*(29.78)*(0.0039) + (0.0039)^2 \u2192 approximately 886.8484 + 0.232 + 0.000015 \u2192 ~887.08 MeV\u00b2.\n\nWait, but that might not be necessary. Let me compute 29.7839^2 more accurately:\n\n29.7839 \u00d729.7839:\n\nLet me compute 29.78^2 = 886.8484.\n\nNow, 0.0039 added to 29.78 \u2192 so (29.78 +0.0039)^2 = 29.78\u00b2 + 2*(29.78)(0.0039) + (0.0039)^2.\n\nWhich is 886.8484 + 0.2306 (approx) + 0.000015 \u2192 887.079.\n\nSo 29.7839\u00b2 \u2248887.079.\n\nAdding 105.7\u00b2=11172.49.\n\nTotal: 887.079 +11172.49=12059.569.\n\nsqrt(12059.569) = let's see, 109.8\u00b2 is 12056.04. 109.8\u00b2= (110-0.2)^2= 110^2 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.2^2 =12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.\n\n109.8^2=12056.04.\n\nDifference between 12059.569 and 12056.04 is 3.529.\n\nSo 109.8 + x)^2 =12059.569 \u2192 approx x can be found as:\n\n(109.8 +x)^2 = 109.8\u00b2 + 2*109.8 x +x\u00b2= 12056.04 + 219.6 x +x\u00b2.\n\nSet equal to 12059.569 \u2192 219.6 x \u2248 3.529 \u2192 x\u22483.529 /219.6 \u22480.01609.\n\nSo sqrt(12059.569) \u2248109.8 +0.01609=109.816 MeV.\n\nSo the muon's energy is approximately 109.816 MeV.\n\nSo KE_mu = 109.816 MeV -105.7 MeV=4.116 MeV \u22484.12 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino's KE is p=29.7839 MeV \u2192 approximately 29.78 MeV.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches our calculations.\n\nSo the answer should be option D.\n",

So (105.7)^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo M^2 - m^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nThen 2 M p = 8315.67 \u2192 p = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6 )\n\nCalculate denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.\n\np = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\nWell, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So 279.2 * 29.78 \u2248 8315. Let me compute 279.2 * 29.78.\n\nWait, 279.2 * 29 is 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8. Hmm, that's not right. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.\n\nLet me approximate 279.2 \u00d7 29.78.\n\nWait, 279.2 * 29.78 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps I can just compute 8315.67 \u00f7 279.2.\n\nLet me do this division.\n\n279.2 * 30 = 8376 \u2192 which is a bit more than 8315.67.\n\nSo 279.2 * 29.8 \u2192 279.2*(30 -0.2) = 8376 - (279.2 * 0.2) = 8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16.\n\nHmm, that's very close to 8315.67. So 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is a bit higher. So perhaps 29.78.\n\nWait, let me compute 279.2 *29.78.\n\nWell, 279.2 \u00d7 29 = 279.2 * 30 =8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8.\n\nWait, no, wait, 279.2 \u00d729 = 279.2 * (30-1) = 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8.\n\nThen, 0.78 \u00d7 279.2 is 0.78 *279.2. Let me compute that:\n\n0.7 *279.2=195.44\n\n0.08*279.2=22.336 \u2192 sum is 195.44 +22.336=217.776\n\nSo 29.78 \u00d7279.2 = 8096.8 +217.776 = 8314.576.\n\nWait, that's very close to 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 -8314.576=1.094.\n\nSo 1.094 / 279.2 \u2248 0.0039. So the total p is approximately 29.78 + 0.0039 \u2248 29.7839.\n\nSo p \u224829.784 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a miscalculation earlier because the neutrino's energy is p, and the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). So the muon's energy is sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).\n\nWait, but let me proceed step by step.\n\nWait, I think the calculation for p is correct. So p \u224829.78 MeV/c.\n\nNow, the muon's energy is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) \u2192 compute that.\n\n29.78^2 is about (30)^2=900, but a bit less. 29.78^2 = approx 886.8.\n\nWait, 29.78 *29.78: 30*30=900. Subtract (0.22)*2*30 + (0.22)^2 \u2192 0.22^2 is 0.0484. So 29.78^2 = 900 - (13.2) + 0.0484 \u2192 900-13.2 is 886.8, plus 0.0484 \u2192 886.8484.\n\n105.7^2 is 11172.49 as calculated earlier.\n\nSo sum is 886.8484 + 11172.49 = 12059.3384.\n\nsqrt(12059.3384) = approximately 109.81 MeV.\n\nWait, because 109^2 is 11881, 110^2 is 12100. So sqrt(12059) is about 109.8.\n\nSo the muon's energy is about 109.8 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino's energy is p \u224829.78 MeV.\n\nWait, but the pion's rest energy is 139.6 MeV. Let me check the sum: 109.8 +29.78 =139.58, which is about 139.6, so that checks out.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of each particle is their total energy minus their rest mass energy.\n\nSo for the muon: KE_mu = Energy_mu - m_mu c\u00b2 = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV =4.1 MeV.\n\nWait, but wait, in natural units, energy is in MeV, and m_mu is 105.7 MeV. So yes, 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino's rest mass is zero, so its KE is equal to its energy, which is p \u224829.78 MeV.\n\nSo the KEs are approximately 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I got.\n\nWait, but let me recheck my calculations for more precise numbers.\n\nWait, when I calculated p, I got p= (139.6^2 -105.7^2)/(2 *139.6) \u2192 which is (19488.16 -11172.49)/(279.2) \u2192 (8315.67)/(279.2) \u2192 let's compute this more accurately.\n\nCompute 8315.67 \u00f7 279.2:\n\nLet me do this division with more precision.\n\n279.2 \u00d7 29.78 = 8314.576, as before. The difference is 8315.67 -8314.576=1.094.\n\nSo 1.094 /279.2 = approximately 0.003919.\n\nSo p \u224829.78 +0.003919 \u224829.7839 MeV.\n\nSo p \u224829.7839 MeV/c.\n\nSo the neutrino's KE is 29.7839 MeV.\n\nMuon's energy: sqrt( (29.7839)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) \u2192 compute 29.7839^2:\n\n29.7839^2 = (29.78)^2 + 2*(29.78)*(0.0039) + (0.0039)^2 \u2192 approximately 886.8484 + 0.232 + 0.000015 \u2192 ~887.08 MeV\u00b2.\n\nWait, but that might not be necessary. Let me compute 29.7839^2 more accurately:\n\n29.7839 \u00d729.7839:\n\nLet me compute 29.78^2 = 886.8484.\n\nNow, 0.0039 added to 29.78 \u2192 so (29.78 +0.0039)^2 = 29.78\u00b2 + 2*(29.78)(0.0039) + (0.0039)^2.\n\nWhich is 886.8484 + 0.2306 (approx) + 0.000015 \u2192 887.079.\n\nSo 29.7839\u00b2 \u2248887.079.\n\nAdding 105.7\u00b2=11172.49.\n\nTotal: 887.079 +11172.49=12059.569.\n\nsqrt(12059.569) = let's see, 109.8\u00b2 is 12056.04. 109.8\u00b2= (110-0.2)^2= 110^2 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.2^2 =12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.\n\n109.8^2=12056.04.\n\nDifference between 12059.569 and 12056.04 is 3.529.\n\nSo 109.8 + x)^2 =12059.569 \u2192 approx x can be found as:\n\n(109.8 +x)^2 = 109.8\u00b2 + 2*109.8 x +x\u00b2= 12056.04 + 219.6 x +x\u00b2.\n\nSet equal to 12059.569 \u2192 219.6 x \u2248 3.529 \u2192 x\u22483.529 /219.6 \u22480.01609.\n\nSo sqrt(12059.569) \u2248109.8 +0.01609=109.816 MeV.\n\nSo the muon's energy is approximately 109.816 MeV.\n\nSo KE_mu = 109.816 MeV -105.7 MeV=4.116 MeV \u22484.12 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino's KE is p=29.7839 MeV \u2192 approximately 29.78 MeV.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches our calculations.\n\nSo the answer should be option D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion, **\u03c0\u207a**, into a muon, **\u03bc\u207a**, and a neutrino, **\u03bd**, using conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as follows:  \n- Rest mass of **\u03c0\u207a**: \\( M = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV} \\)  \n- Rest mass of **\u03bc\u207a**: \\( m_\\mu = 105.7 \\, \\text{MeV} \\)  \n- Neutrino mass is assumed to be negligible.  \n\n### Key Equations and Analysis:\n1. **Energy Conservation**:  \n   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  \n   \\[\n   E_{\\text{total}} = M = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n   \\]  \n   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:  \n   \\[\n   E_{\\text{total}} = E_\\mu + E_\\nu,\n   \\]  \n   where \\( E_\\mu = \\sqrt{p^2 + m_\\mu^2} \\) (relativistic energy of the muon) and \\( E_\\nu = p \\) (energy of the massless neutrino).  \n\n2. **Momentum Conservation**:  \n   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. Thus, the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:  \n   \\[\n   p_\\mu = p_\\nu = p.\n   \\]  \n\n3. **Solving for Momentum \\( p \\)**:  \n   Using energy conservation:  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{p^2 + m_\\mu^2} + p = M.\n   \\]  \n   Rearranging and squaring both sides:  \n   \\[\n   p^2 + m_\\mu^2 = (M - p)^2.\n   \\]  \n   Expanding and simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   p^2 + m_\\mu^2 = M^2 - 2Mp + p^2.\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   m_\\mu^2 = M^2 - 2Mp.\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\( p \\):  \n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{M^2 - m_\\mu^2}{2M}.\n   \\]  \n\n4. **Substitute Values**:  \n   - \\( M^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \\, \\text{MeV}^2 \\),  \n   - \\( m_\\mu^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \\, \\text{MeV}^2 \\),  \n   - \\( M^2 - m_\\mu^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \\, \\text{MeV}^2 \\),  \n   - \\( 2M = 2 \\times 139.6 = 279.2 \\, \\text{MeV} \\).  \n\n   Thus:  \n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n   \\]  \n\n5. **Muon Energy**:  \n   The muon's energy is:  \n   \\[\n   E_\\mu = \\sqrt{p^2 + m_\\mu^2} = \\sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.\n   \\]  \n   - \\( 29.78^2 \\approx 886.85 \\),  \n   - \\( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \\),  \n   - \\( E_\\mu = \\sqrt{886.85 + 11172.49} = \\sqrt{12059.34} \\approx 109.82 \\, \\text{MeV}. \\)  \n\n6. **Kinetic Energy of Muon**:  \n   The muon's kinetic energy is:  \n   \\[\n   KE_\\mu = E_\\mu - m_\\mu = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n   \\]  \n\n7. **Neutrino Energy**:  \n   The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:  \n   \\[\n   KE_\\nu = E_\\nu = p = 29.78 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n   \\]  \n\n### Final Answer:\nThe kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately **4.12 MeV** and **29.8 MeV**, respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:  \n\n**Answer: D**",
