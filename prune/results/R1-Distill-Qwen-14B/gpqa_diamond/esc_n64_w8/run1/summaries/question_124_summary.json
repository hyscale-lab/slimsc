      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.\n\nThe question is about particles being collided in a detector. The setup says that when particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector, new particles are produced. These new particles travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters.\n\nNow, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.\n\nHmm, okay. So I think the key here is understanding the relationship between the Lorentz factor and how far a particle travels before decaying. Because the particles are fast-decaying, their lifetime is probably related to their speed. The faster they go (higher Lorentz factor), the longer they can travel before decaying, right?\n\nWait, but wait. The distance they can travel depends on their lifetime as observed in the lab frame. Because from the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor gamma. So the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) is tau, and the lab lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nSo the distance the particle travels is velocity multiplied by the time it lives. The velocity is approximately the speed of light for ultra-relativistic particles, so v \u2248 c. So the distance L is c * gamma * tau.\n\nIn the original scenario, the particles have a Lorentz factor of 20, and one third reach the detector walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. So for one third of the particles to reach the wall, the average distance they travel must be about 30 meters.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the particles are produced at the center. So the maximum possible distance to the wall is 30 meters. So if a particle's average decay length is more than 30 meters, then a certain fraction would reach the wall.\n\nWait, perhaps the fraction that reaches the wall depends on how much of their decay length is beyond the detector's radius. So if the decay length is L, then the probability that a particle travels more than 30 meters is (L - 30)/L, assuming the decay follows an exponential distribution. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the average decay length.\n\nAlternatively, for an exponential decay, the probability that a particle's lifetime is longer than a certain time is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), where t is the time in the lab frame. So the distance would be v t \u2248 c t. So the decay length L is gamma c tau.\n\nWait, so the average distance a particle travels before decaying is L = gamma c tau. So if L is greater than the detector radius, the particle has a chance to reach the wall.\n\nBut the problem states that, for gamma=20, one third reach the wall. So perhaps that implies that the average decay length is such that 30 meters is one third of L. Or maybe it's the other way around.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this with the decay probability. The particles decay exponentially with a mean lifetime gamma tau. So the probability that a particle hasn't decayed when it's traveled a distance x is exp(-x/(gamma c tau)). Because the time is x/(c), and the probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo the probability P that a particle reaches the detector wall (x=30 m) is P = exp(-30/(gamma c tau)).\n\nIn the original scenario, gamma is 20, and P is 1/3. So:\n\n1/3 = exp(-30/(20 c tau)).\n\nWait, but I don't know what c tau is. Let's see. Let me solve for c tau.\n\nTake natural log on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau)\n\n=> ln(3) = 30/(20 c tau)\n\n=> c tau = 30/(20 ln 3 )\n\nSimplify: 30/(20) is 3/2, so c tau = (3/2) / ln3.\n\nNow, for the new scenario, we want P to be 2/3. So:\n\n2/3 = exp(-30/(gamma' c tau)).\n\nTake ln:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(gamma' c tau)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nln(3/2) = 30/(gamma' c tau)\n\nBut from the first part, c tau = (3/2) / ln3.\n\nSo substitute that into the equation:\n\nln(3/2) = 30 / (gamma' * (3/(2 ln3)) ) )\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nSo:\n\n30/(gamma' * (3/(2 ln3))) ) = 30 * 2 ln3 / (3 gamma') )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n30 * 2 = 60.\n\nSo 60 ln3 / (3 gamma') ) = (20 ln3)/gamma' .\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\nln(3/2) = (20 ln3)/gamma'\n\nWe can solve for gamma':\n\ngamma' = (20 ln3) / ln(3/2)\n\nWait, let me compute the values numerically.\n\nCompute ln(3) \u2248 1.0986\n\nln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055\n\nSo 20 * 1.0986 \u2248 21.972\n\nDivide by 0.4055:\n\n21.972 / 0.4055 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\nWell, 0.4055 * 54 is approximately 21.9 (because 50 * 0.4055 is 20.275, 4*0.4055 is 1.622; 20.275 + 1.622=21.897). So 54 would give about 21.9. So gamma' is approximately 54.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54.\n\nWait, but let me check the steps again. Because sometimes it's easy to mix up the equations.\n\nSo, in the original scenario:\n\nP = 1/3 = exp(-30/(gamma c tau)).\n\nSo ln(1/3) = -30/(gamma c tau) \u2192 ln3 = 30/(gamma c tau).\n\nSo c tau = 30/(gamma ln3). For gamma=20, that's 30/(20 * 1.0986) \u2248 30/(21.97) \u2248 1.364 meters.\n\nWait, but in the second case, we need P=2/3.\n\nSo 2/3 = exp(-30/(gamma' c tau)).\n\nTake ln: ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma' c tau).\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: ln(3/2) = 30/(gamma' c tau).\n\nBut from the first part, c tau = 30/(gamma ln3) \u2192 substitute that into the second equation.\n\nSo ln(3/2) = 30 / (gamma' * (30/(gamma ln3)) )\n\nSimplify denominator: gamma' * (30/(gamma ln3)) \u2192 (30 gamma')/(gamma ln3)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nln(3/2) = 30 / [ (30 gamma')/(gamma ln3) ) ]\n\nWhich is ln(3/2) = [30 * gamma ln3 ] / (30 gamma') )\n\nSimplify 30 cancels, so:\n\nln(3/2) = (gamma ln3) / gamma'\n\nSo gamma' = (gamma ln3 ) / ln(3/2 )\n\nWe know gamma is 20.\n\nSo gamma' = (20 * ln3) / ln(3/2 )\n\nCompute numerically:\n\nln3 \u2248 1.0986\n\nln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055\n\nSo 20 * 1.0986 \u2248 21.972\n\nDivide by 0.4055: 21.972 / 0.4055 \u2248 54.16.\n\nSo approximately 54. So the answer is option A)54.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand it. Hmm, particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds. The Lorentz factor mentioned is around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nThe question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. So, from one third to two-thirds, the required Lorentz factor must change accordingly.\n\nWait, so I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. But how does that apply here? Let's think about the particles' decay and their path to the detector's walls.\n\nSo, the particles are created at the center of the detector. They move outward at a speed determined by their Lorentz factor. The time they have to reach the wall depends on how fast they're moving. But wait, since they are fast-decaying, the decay time is very short. So, the proper time for the particle's decay is important here.\n\nThe proper time \u03c4 is the time measured in the particle's rest frame. The time experienced in the lab frame (detector frame) would be longer due to time dilation. The time the particle has to travel to the wall is t = R/(v), where R is the radius of the detector and v is the particle's speed.\n\nBut wait, the particle can only reach the wall if it doesn't decay before that. So, the proper time for the particle to reach the wall is \u03c4 = t / gamma. Because in the particle's frame, the time is shorter. So, the condition is \u03c4 <= the particle's lifetime.\n\nWait, but in the original case, one third reach the wall. So, let's model this.\n\nIn the original scenario, the Lorentz factor is gamma1 = 20. So, the speed is v1 = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma1^2)).\n\nThe time for the particle to reach the wall is t1 = R/(v1). But because of time dilation, the proper time experienced by the particle is \u03c4 = t1 / gamma1.\n\nThe probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the wall is given by the exponential decay formula. The probability P is exp(-\u03c4/tau0), where tau0 is the proper lifetime of the particle. So, in the first case, P1 = 1/3. So,\n\n1/3 = exp( - (t1 / gamma1) / tau0 )\n\nSimilarly, in the second case, we want P2 = 2/3. So,\n\n2/3 = exp( - (t2 / gamma2) / tau0 )\n\nBut wait, the radius R is the same in both cases. So, R is 30 meters.\n\nWait, but the time t is R/v, so t1 = R/(v1), and t2 = R/(v2). But v is related to gamma as v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). So, v = c * sqrt( (gamma^2 -1)/gamma^2 ) = c * sqrt(gamma^2 -1)/gamma.\n\nSo, t = R/(v) = R * gamma / (c * sqrt(gamma^2 -1)).\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe another approach. Let's think in terms of the proper time.\n\nThe proper time \u03c4 for the particle to reach the wall is \u03c4 = t / gamma. And t is R/(v). So, \u03c4 = R/(v * gamma).\n\nBut v is a function of gamma. So, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). So, substituting that:\n\n\u03c4 = R / ( c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) * gamma )\n\nHmm. Let's simplify that expression. Let's square both numerator and denominator to see if it can be simplified. Alternatively, maybe express in terms of gamma.\n\nLet me see: sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt( (gamma^2 -1)/gamma^2 ) ) = sqrt(gamma^2 -1)/gamma.\n\nSo, the denominator becomes (c * (sqrt(gamma^2 -1)/gamma ) * gamma ) = c * sqrt(gamma^2 -1).\n\nSo, \u03c4 = R / (c * sqrt(gamma^2 -1)).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So \u03c4 = R/(c sqrt( gamma\u00b2 -1 )).\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me recheck:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) \u2192 v = c * sqrt( (gamma\u00b2 -1)/gamma\u00b2 ) \u2192 v = c * sqrt(gamma\u00b2 -1)/gamma.\n\nSo, v = c * sqrt(gamma\u00b2 -1)/gamma.\n\nThen, t = R / v \u2192 t = R * gamma/( c * sqrt(gamma\u00b2 -1) )\n\nProper time \u03c4 = t / gamma \u2192 \u03c4 = R/( c * sqrt(gamma\u00b2 -1) )\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the proper time \u03c4 is R/(c * sqrt(gamma\u00b2 -1)).\n\nNow, the decay probability is P = exp( - \u03c4 / tau0 )\n\nIn the initial case, gamma1 is 20, and P1 is 1/3.\n\nSo, 1/3 = exp( - (R/(c sqrt(gamma1\u00b2 -1)) ) / tau0 )\n\nSimilarly, in the second case, gamma2 is the unknown, and P2 is 2/3.\n\nSo, 2/3 = exp( - (R/(c sqrt(gamma2\u00b2 -1)) ) / tau0 )\n\nWait, but both expressions have R, c, tau0. Maybe take the ratio of the two equations to eliminate R, c, tau0.\n\nLet me write the two equations:\n\nEquation 1: ln(1/3) = - (R/(c tau0 sqrt(gamma1\u00b2 -1)) )\n\nEquation 2: ln(2/3) = - (R/(c tau0 sqrt(gamma2\u00b2 -1)) )\n\nSo, let's take the ratio of equation 1 to equation 2.\n\n[ ln(1/3) ] / [ ln(2/3) ] = [ - R/(c tau0 sqrt(gamma1\u00b2 -1)) ] / [ - R/(c tau0 sqrt(gamma2\u00b2 -1)) ]\n\nThe negatives and R, c, tau0 cancel out.\n\nSo,\n\n[ ln(1/3) ] / [ ln(2/3) ] = sqrt( gamma2\u00b2 -1 ) / sqrt( gamma1\u00b2 -1 )\n\nCompute the left-hand side. Let's compute the numerical values.\n\nln(1/3) is ln(0.333...) \u2248 -1.0986.\n\nln(2/3) is ln(0.666...) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nSo, the ratio is (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) \u2248 2.708.\n\nSo,\n\n2.708 \u2248 sqrt( gamma2\u00b2 -1 ) / sqrt( gamma1\u00b2 -1 )\n\nWe know gamma1 is 20. So, gamma1\u00b2 is 400, gamma1\u00b2 -1 is 399. So, sqrt(399) \u2248 19.975 \u2248 20.\n\nSo,\n\n2.708 \u2248 sqrt( gamma2\u00b2 -1 ) / 20 \u2192 sqrt(gamma2\u00b2 -1) \u2248 2.708 * 20 \u2248 54.16.\n\nSo, gamma2\u00b2 -1 \u2248 (54.16)^2 \u2192 approx 54.16 squared is about 54 *54 = 2916, but let me compute 54.16^2.\n\nWait, 54^2 is 2916. 54.16^2 is approximately (54 + 0.16)^2 = 54^2 + 2*54*0.16 + 0.16^2 = 2916 + 17.28 + 0.0256 \u2248 2933.3.\n\nSo, gamma2\u00b2 \u2248 2933.3 + 1 = 2934.3.\n\nSo, gamma2 is sqrt(2934.3) \u2248 let's see.\n\n54^2 = 2916. 54.16^2=2933.3 as above.\n\nSo sqrt(2934.3) is about 54.16. Hmm, but wait that can't be right because gamma2 is supposed to be larger than gamma1, which was 20. Oh, wait no, because the ratio is 2.7, so gamma2 would be higher.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the ratio is [ ln(1/3) ] / [ ln(2/3) ] \u2248 ( -1.0986 ) / ( -0.4055 ) \u2248 2.708.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n2.708 = sqrt( (gamma2^2 -1) ) / sqrt( (gamma1^2 -1) )\n\nSo, sqrt( gamma2^2 -1 ) = 2.708 * sqrt( gamma1^2 -1 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\ngamma2^2 -1 = (2.708)^2 * (gamma1^2 -1 )\n\ngamma1 is 20, so gamma1^2 is 400. gamma1^2 -1 is 399.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma2^2 -1 = (2.708)^2 * 399.\n\nCompute (2.708)^2: 2.708 *2.708 \u2248 7.33.\n\nSo, 7.33 * 399 \u2248 7.33 *400 = 2932, minus 7.33 \u2192 2932 -7.33=2924.67.\n\nSo, gamma2^2 = 2924.67 +1=2925.67.\n\nThen, gamma2= sqrt(2925.67) \u2248 let's compute this.\n\nWhat's 54 squared? 2916. 54^2=2916.\n\n54.1^2=54^2 +2*54*0.1 +0.1^2=2916 +10.8 +0.01=2926.81.\n\nWait, 54.1^2=2926.81. Our target is 2925.67, which is a bit less. So, perhaps gamma2 is about 54.08 or something.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, option B is 68, C is40, D is28.\n\nSo, the calculation suggests gamma2 is around 54.1, so option A is 54.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the ratio of the probabilities is 2/3 to 1/3. So, when the Lorentz factor increases, the proper time \u03c4 decreases because \u03c4 = R/(c sqrt(gamma\u00b2-1)).\n\nWait, if gamma increases, sqrt(gamma^2-1) increases, so \u03c4 decreases. So, lower \u03c4 implies that the particles have less time to decay, so more of them reach the detector walls.\n\nSo, if in the first case gamma1=20, 1/3 reach the wall. So, to get 2/3 to reach, the gamma needs to be higher so that the particles have less time to decay. So, yes, the gamma should be higher than 20. So, 54 is higher than 20, so that makes sense.\n\nWait, but the options include 54 as option A and 68 as option B. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, I computed the ratio as 2.708, which is (ln(1/3))/(ln(2/3)).\n\nWait, let me compute that again.\n\nln(1/3) is approximately -1.098612289.\n\nln(2/3) is approximately -0.405465108.\n\nSo, the ratio is (-1.098612289)/(-0.405465108) \u2248 2.70805.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nThen, sqrt(gamma2^2 -1) = 2.70805 * sqrt( gamma1^2 -1 )\n\ngamma1 is 20, so sqrt(399) is approximately 19.975, which is about 20.\n\nSo, 2.70805 *20 = 54.161.\n\nSo, sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )=54.161 \u2192 gamma2^2 -1 = (54.161)^2 \u2248 2933.3.\n\ngamma2^2 = 2934.3 \u2192 gamma2\u224854.16.\n\nSo, the needed gamma is about 54.16, which is close to 54, so option A.\n\nBut wait, the options include 68 as B. Did I make a mistake in the ratio?\n\nWait, perhaps I flipped the ratio. Because in the first case, 1/3 reach, and in the second case, 2/3 reach. So, the probability increased, meaning the proper time is smaller, so gamma is higher. So, the ratio of probabilities is (2/3)/(1/3) = 2. So, perhaps I should have taken the ratio as (ln(2/3))/(ln(1/3)).\n\nWait, wait, the way I set up the equations, equation 1 is for 1/3, equation 2 is for 2/3.\n\nSo, equation 1: 1/3 = exp( - tau_1 / tau0 )\n\nEquation 2: 2/3 = exp( - tau_2 / tau0 )\n\nTaking the ratio equation1/equation2: (1/3)/(2/3) = exp( (tau_2 - tau_1)/tau0 )\n\nWhich is 1/2 = exp( (tau_2 - tau_1)/tau0 )\n\nBut earlier, I took the ratio of the natural logs as [ln(1/3)]/[ln(2/3)] which is correct.\n\nWait, but another approach: since both probabilities are exp(-tau_i/tau0), taking the ratio of the probabilities gives exp( (tau1 - tau2)/tau0 ) = (1/3)/(2/3) ) = 1/2.\n\nSo, (tau1 - tau2)/tau0 = ln(1/2) \u2248 -0.6931.\n\nSo, tau1 - tau2 = -0.6931 * tau0.\n\nBut tau1 = R/(c sqrt(gamma1\u00b2 -1 )).\n\ntau2 = R/(c sqrt(gamma2\u00b2 -1 )).\n\nSo, tau1 - tau2 = [ R/(c) ) ( 1/sqrt(gamma1\u00b2-1) - 1/sqrt(gamma2\u00b2-1) ) ] = -0.6931 tau0.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if this approach will get me anywhere. It might complicate things further. Maybe I should stick with the first approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the relation between the probabilities and the Lorentz factors. Let me think about how the probabilities change with gamma.\n\nAs gamma increases, the proper time \u03c4 decreases because \u03c4 = R/(c sqrt(gamma^2-1)), which means the probability P = exp( - \u03c4/tau0 ) increases because the exponent becomes less negative. So, higher gamma means higher P. Because if the particle has less time to decay, more of them make it to the detector wall.\n\nIn the initial scenario, gamma=20, P=1/3. We want P=2/3, which is higher, so we need a higher gamma.\n\nSo, the calculation I did earlier suggests gamma2\u224854. So, the answer should be option A)54.\n\nWait, but the options also include option B)68. Why isn't it 68? Did I miss a step?\n\nLet me think again. Maybe the time to reach the wall is not just R/v, but perhaps there's another factor. Because the particles are moving at a speed v, which is a significant fraction of c. Wait, but the formula for the proper time is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the velocity in terms of beta, where beta = v/c. So, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). So, beta = sqrt( (gamma^2 -1)/gamma^2 ) \u2192 beta = sqrt( gamma^2 -1 ) / gamma.\n\nSo, the time to reach the wall is t = R/(beta c) = R/(v) = R/(beta c).\n\nThen, tau = t/gamma = R/(beta c gamma) \u2192 but beta is sqrt(gamma^2 -1)/gamma. So, beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1).\n\nSo, tau = R/(c sqrt(gamma^2 -1)).\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nSo, the previous calculation holds.\n\nThus, the correct answer is approximately 54, so option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand it. Hmm, particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds. The Lorentz factor mentioned is around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nThe question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. So, from one third to two-thirds, the required Lorentz factor must change accordingly.\n\nWait, so I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. But how does that apply here? Let's think about the particles' decay and their path to the detector's walls.\n\nSo, the particles are created at the center of the detector. They move outward at a speed determined by their Lorentz factor. The time they have to reach the wall depends on how fast they're moving. But wait, since they are fast-decaying, the decay time is very short. So, the proper time for the particle's decay is important here.\n\nThe proper time \u03c4 is the time measured in the particle's rest frame. The time experienced in the lab frame (detector frame) would be longer due to time dilation. The time the particle has to travel to the wall is t = R/(v), where R is the radius of the detector and v is the particle's speed.\n\nBut wait, the particle can only reach the wall if it doesn't decay before that. So, the proper time for the particle to reach the wall is \u03c4 = t / gamma. Because in the particle's frame, the time is shorter. So, the condition is \u03c4 <= the particle's lifetime.\n\nWait, but in the original case, one third reach the wall. So, let's model this.\n\nIn the original scenario, the Lorentz factor is gamma1 = 20. So, the speed is v1 = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma1^2)).\n\nThe time for the particle to reach the wall is t1 = R/(v1). But because of time dilation, the proper time experienced by the particle is \u03c4 = t1 / gamma1.\n\nThe probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the wall is given by the exponential decay formula. The probability P is exp(-\u03c4/tau0), where tau0 is the proper lifetime of the particle. So, in the first case, P1 = 1/3. So,\n\n1/3 = exp( - (t1 / gamma1) / tau0 )\n\nSimilarly, in the second case, we want P2 = 2/3. So,\n\n2/3 = exp( - (t2 / gamma2) / tau0 )\n\nBut wait, the radius R is the same in both cases. So, R is 30 meters.\n\nWait, but the time t is R/v, so t1 = R/(v1), and t2 = R/(v2). But v is related to gamma as v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). So, v = c * sqrt( (gamma^2 -1)/gamma^2 ) = c * sqrt(gamma^2 -1)/gamma.\n\nSo, t = R/(v) = R * gamma / (c * sqrt(gamma^2 -1)).\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe another approach. Let's think in terms of the proper time.\n\nThe proper time \u03c4 for the particle to reach the wall is \u03c4 = t / gamma. And t is R/(v). So, \u03c4 = R/(v * gamma).\n\nBut v is a function of gamma. So, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). So, substituting that:\n\n\u03c4 = R / ( c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) * gamma )\n\nHmm. Let's simplify that expression. Let's square both numerator and denominator to see if it can be simplified. Alternatively, maybe express in terms of gamma.\n\nLet me see: sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt( (gamma^2 -1)/gamma^2 ) ) = sqrt(gamma^2 -1)/gamma.\n\nSo, the denominator becomes (c * (sqrt(gamma^2 -1)/gamma ) * gamma ) = c * sqrt(gamma^2 -1).\n\nSo, \u03c4 = R / (c * sqrt(gamma^2 -1)).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So \u03c4 = R/(c sqrt( gamma\u00b2 -1 )).\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me recheck:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) \u2192 v = c * sqrt( (gamma\u00b2 -1)/gamma\u00b2 ) \u2192 v = c * sqrt(gamma\u00b2 -1)/gamma.\n\nSo, v = c * sqrt(gamma\u00b2 -1)/gamma.\n\nThen, t = R / v \u2192 t = R * gamma/( c * sqrt(gamma\u00b2 -1) )\n\nProper time \u03c4 = t / gamma \u2192 \u03c4 = R/( c * sqrt(gamma\u00b2 -1) )\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the proper time \u03c4 is R/(c * sqrt(gamma\u00b2 -1)).\n\nNow, the decay probability is P = exp( - \u03c4 / tau0 )\n\nIn the initial case, gamma1 is 20, and P1 is 1/3.\n\nSo, 1/3 = exp( - (R/(c sqrt(gamma1\u00b2 -1)) ) / tau0 )\n\nSimilarly, in the second case, gamma2 is the unknown, and P2 is 2/3.\n\nSo, 2/3 = exp( - (R/(c sqrt(gamma2\u00b2 -1)) ) / tau0 )\n\nWait, but both expressions have R, c, tau0.

Our target is 2925.67, which is a bit less. So, perhaps gamma2 is about 54.08 or something.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, option B is 68, C is40, D is28.\n\nSo, the calculation suggests gamma2 is around 54.1, so option A is 54.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the ratio of the probabilities is 2/3 to 1/3. So, when the Lorentz factor increases, the proper time \u03c4 decreases because \u03c4 = R/(c sqrt(gamma\u00b2-1)).\n\nWait, if gamma increases, sqrt(gamma^2-1) increases, so \u03c4 decreases. So, lower \u03c4 implies that the particles have less time to decay, so more of them reach the detector walls.\n\nSo, if in the first case gamma1=20, 1/3 reach the wall. So, to get 2/3 to reach, the gamma needs to be higher so that the particles have less time to decay. So, yes, the gamma should be higher than 20. So, 54 is higher than 20, so that makes sense.\n\nWait, but the options include 54 as option A and 68 as option B. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, I computed the ratio as 2.708, which is (ln(1/3))/(ln(2/3)).\n\nWait, let me compute that again.\n\nln(1/3) is approximately -1.098612289.\n\nln(2/3) is approximately -0.405465108.\n\nSo, the ratio is (-1.098612289)/(-0.405465108) \u2248 2.70805.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nThen, sqrt(gamma2^2 -1) = 2.70805 * sqrt( gamma1^2 -1 )\n\ngamma1 is 20, so sqrt(399) is approximately 19.975, which is about 20.\n\nSo, 2.70805 *20 = 54.161.\n\nSo, sqrt(gamma2^2 -1 )=54.161 \u2192 gamma2^2 -1 = (54.161)^2 \u2248 2933.3.\n\ngamma2^2 = 2934.3 \u2192 gamma2\u224854.16.\n\nSo, the needed gamma is about 54.16, which is close to 54, so option A.\n\nBut wait, the options include 68 as B. Did I make a mistake in the ratio?\n\nWait, perhaps I flipped the ratio. Because in the first case, 1/3 reach, and in the second case, 2/3 reach. So, the probability increased, meaning the proper time is smaller, so gamma is higher. So, the ratio of probabilities is (2/3)/(1/3) = 2. So, perhaps I should have taken the ratio as (ln(2/3))/(ln(1/3)).\n\nWait, wait, the way I set up the equations, equation 1 is for 1/3, equation 2 is for 2/3.\n\nSo, equation 1: 1/3 = exp( - tau_1 / tau0 )\n\nEquation 2: 2/3 = exp( - tau_2 / tau0 )\n\nTaking the ratio equation1/equation2: (1/3)/(2/3) = exp( (tau_2 - tau_1)/tau0 )\n\nWhich is 1/2 = exp( (tau_2 - tau_1)/tau0 )\n\nBut earlier, I took the ratio of the natural logs as [ln(1/3)]/[ln(2/3)] which is correct.\n\nWait, but another approach: since both probabilities are exp(-tau_i/tau0), taking the ratio of the probabilities gives exp( (tau1 - tau2)/tau0 ) = (1/3)/(2/3) ) = 1/2.\n\nSo, (tau1 - tau2)/tau0 = ln(1/2) \u2248 -0.6931.\n\nSo, tau1 - tau2 = -0.6931 * tau0.\n\nBut tau1 = R/(c sqrt(gamma1\u00b2 -1 )).\n\ntau2 = R/(c sqrt(gamma2\u00b2 -1 )).\n\nSo, tau1 - tau2 = [ R/(c) ) ( 1/sqrt(gamma1\u00b2-1) - 1/sqrt(gamma2\u00b2-1) ) ] = -0.6931 tau0.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if this approach will get me anywhere. It might complicate things further. Maybe I should stick with the first approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the relation between the probabilities and the Lorentz factors. Let me think about how the probabilities change with gamma.\n\nAs gamma increases, the proper time \u03c4 decreases because \u03c4 = R/(c sqrt(gamma^2-1)), which means the probability P = exp( - \u03c4/tau0 ) increases because the exponent becomes less negative. So, higher gamma means higher P. Because if the particle has less time to decay, more of them make it to the detector wall.\n\nIn the initial scenario, gamma=20, P=1/3. We want P=2/3, which is higher, so we need a higher gamma.\n\nSo, the calculation I did earlier suggests gamma2\u224854. So, the answer should be option A)54.\n\nWait, but the options also include option B)68. Why isn't it 68? Did I miss a step?\n\nLet me think again. Maybe the time to reach the wall is not just R/v, but perhaps there's another factor. Because the particles are moving at a speed v, which is a significant fraction of c. Wait, but the formula for the proper time is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the velocity in terms of beta, where beta = v/c. So, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). So, beta = sqrt( (gamma^2 -1)/gamma^2 ) \u2192 beta = sqrt( gamma^2 -1 ) / gamma.\n\nSo, the time to reach the wall is t = R/(beta c) = R/(v) = R/(beta c).\n\nThen, tau = t/gamma = R/(beta c gamma) \u2192 but beta is sqrt(gamma^2 -1)/gamma. So, beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1).\n\nSo, tau = R/(c sqrt(gamma^2 -1)).\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nSo, the previous calculation holds.\n\nThus, the correct answer is approximately 54, so option A.\n\n\nTo determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the proper time experienced by the particles, and their decay probability.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Proper Time and Decay Probability**:  \n   The proper time for a particle to reach the detector's wall is given by:  \n   \\[\n   \\tau = \\frac{R}{c \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}}\n   \\]  \n   where \\( R \\) is the detector radius, \\( c \\) is the speed of light, and \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand what's being asked. Hmm, particles are collided in a detector, and some of the new particles decay quickly. The setup is that when they collide, particles are produced which travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.\n\nWait, okay, so I think this has to do with the particles' lifetime and how far they can travel before decaying. Because if they decay quickly, maybe their lifetime is shorter, so they can only reach a certain distance before decaying. If the detector is 30 meters in radius, then the particles that reach the inner walls must have a longer lifetime or higher speed to cover that distance before decaying.\n\nI remember that for particles moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma times their proper lifetime. So gamma is the Lorentz factor. So if the proper lifetime is tau, then the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nThe distance a particle travels before decaying would be its speed multiplied by the time it lives. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, I can approximate the speed as the speed of light, c. So the distance L is approximately c * gamma * tau.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that at a Lorentz factor of 20, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So let's think about that. The particles that reach the walls are those that have a lifetime long enough for them to travel 30 meters.\n\nWait, no, actually, the detector radius is 30 meters. So the particles produced at the center need to travel 30 meters to reach the wall. So for a particle to reach the wall, the distance they need to cover is 30 meters. So the time they have to live is the time it takes light to travel 30 meters, but wait, no, because they are moving at speed v. Oh wait, but if they're ultra-relativistic, v is nearly c, so let's just approximate v as c.\n\nSo the time t is distance divided by speed: t = L / v \u2248 L / c. So t \u2248 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds? Wait, but perhaps I should express it more accurately.\n\nBut the key point is that the proper lifetime tau is related to the lab frame lifetime by gamma = t_lab / tau. So tau = t_lab / gamma.\n\nBut wait, the particles that decay before reaching the wall don't make it. So the fraction that reach the wall depends on the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.\n\nSo the probability P that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that its lifetime is longer than t = L / v. Since v is about c, t \u2248 L/(c).\n\nSo P = probability that tau' (the proper lifetime) > t / gamma. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.\n\nIn the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). The time it takes to reach the wall is t = L / v \u2248 L / c. So the particle will reach the wall only if its lifetime in the lab frame is longer than t.\n\nSo the condition is gamma * tau > t. So gamma > t/(tau).\n\nBut the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than t is the same as the probability that gamma * tau > t, which is the same as gamma > t/(tau).\n\nWait, but tau is the mean proper lifetime. Hmm, but maybe I should model this as a decay process. The decay follows an exponential distribution. So the probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/tau), where tau is the mean lifetime.\n\nSo the probability that the particle reaches the wall is P = exp(-t/(gamma * tau)).\n\nWait, because in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma*tau, so the probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no, wait. In the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. So the decay time in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed yet after time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nBut t is the time it takes to reach the wall. So t = L/(v) \u2248 L/c, since v is close to c.\n\nSo P = exp( - L/(c gamma tau) )\n\nIn the given scenario, when gamma is 20, the probability P is 1/3. So:\n\n1/3 = exp( - (30 m) / (c * 20 tau) )\n\nWe can solve for tau in terms of gamma=20.\n\nTaking natural logs on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = - (30)/(20 c tau)\n\nSo ln(1/3) is negative, which makes sense.\n\nln(1/3) \u2248 -1.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n-1.0986 = - (30)/(20 c tau)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n1.0986 \u2248 30/(20 c tau)\n\nSo,\n\n20 c tau * 1.0986 \u224830\n\nWait, wait, let me re-arrange.\n\n(30) / (20 c tau) ) = 1.0986\n\nSo,\n\n(30)/(20 c tau) ) = ln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nWait, wait, ln(3) is approximately 1.0986, right. So,\n\n(30)/(20 c tau) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\n(3)/(2 c tau) ) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\nc tau = 3/( 2 ln(3) )\n\nCalculate that:\n\nln(3) is about 1.0986, so 2*1.0986 \u2248 2.1972.\n\n3 divided by 2.1972 is approximately 1.367.\n\nSo c tau \u2248 1.367 meters.\n\nWait, so tau is 1.367 / c seconds. Since c is about 3e8 m/s, tau is 1.367/(3e8) \u2248 4.557e-9 seconds.\n\nBut wait, maybe I don't need to calculate tau numerically. Because when we have the second scenario, where the probability is 2/3, we can set up the equation again.\n\nIn the second case, the desired probability is 2/3, so:\n\n2/3 = exp( - (30)/(c gamma' tau) )\n\nTaking ln on both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = - (30)/(c gamma' tau)\n\nSo,\n\nln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\n-0.4055 = - (30)/(c gamma' tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n0.4055 = 30/( c gamma' tau )\n\nBut from the first case, we found that 30/(c gamma tau) ) = ln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nWait, no, earlier, when gamma was 20, the equation was:\n\n30/(20 c tau) = ln(3).\n\nSo,\n\n30/(c tau) = 20 ln(3).\n\nSo,\n\nc tau = 30/(20 ln(3)) = 3/(2 ln(3)) \u2248 1.367 m, which is what I had before.\n\nSo in the second case,\n\n30/(c gamma' tau) ) = (30)/(c tau) * (1/gamma') )\n\n= (20 ln(3)) ) * (1/gamma' )\n\nBecause from the first case, 30/(c tau) = 20 ln(3).\n\nWait, let me see: from the first case,\n\n30/(20 c tau) ) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\n30/(c tau) ) = 20 ln(3)\n\nSo, 30/(c gamma' tau) ) = (20 ln(3)) / gamma'\n\nSo,\n\n(20 ln(3)) / gamma' ) = ln(3) * (20 / gamma' ) )\n\nWait, wait, maybe not. Let me go back.\n\nWe have the equation for the second case:\n\n30/(c gamma' tau) ) = ln(3) * (30/(c tau) ) / (20 gamma' )\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think differently.\n\nWe have from the first case:\n\n(30) / (c tau * 20) ) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\n30/(c tau) = 20 ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\nc tau = 30/(20 ln(3)) = 3/(2 ln(3)) \u2248 1.367 m.\n\nSo in the second case,\n\n30/(c gamma' tau) ) = (30) / (gamma' * c tau )\n\nSubstituting c tau from the first case,\n\n= 30 / (gamma' * (3/(2 ln(3))) )\n\n= (30 * 2 ln(3)) ) / (gamma' * 3 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (60 ln(3)) / (3 gamma' )\n\n= 20 ln(3) / gamma'\n\nSo,\n\n30/(c gamma' tau) ) = 20 ln(3) / gamma'\n\nBut in the second case, the equation is:\n\n(30)/(c gamma' tau) ) = ln(3) * (30/(c tau) ) / (20 gamma' )\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me write the equations again.\n\nFrom first case:\n\n30/(20 c tau) = ln(3) --> equation (1)\n\nFrom second case:\n\n30/(gamma' c tau) = ln( (2/3) )? No, wait no.\n\nWait, the second case's equation is:\n\nexp( - (30)/(gamma' c tau) ) ) = 2/3\n\nWait no, no. Wait, the general equation is:\n\nP = exp( - (30)/(gamma c tau) )\n\nIn the first case, P=1/3, gamma=20:\n\n1/3 = exp( -30/(20 c tau) )\n\nTaking ln both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau )\n\nSo,\n\n30/(20 c tau ) = - ln(1/3) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\n30/(20 c tau ) = ln(3) --> equation (1)\n\nIn the second case, P=2/3:\n\n2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma' c tau) )\n\nTake ln:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(gamma' c tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n- ln(2/3) = 30/(gamma' c tau )\n\nSo,\n\n30/(gamma' c tau ) = ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055\n\nBut from equation (1):\n\n30/(20 c tau ) = ln(3) --> 30/(c tau ) = 20 ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\n30/(c tau ) = 20 ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\n30/(gamma' c tau ) = (30/(c tau )) ) * (1/gamma' )\n\n= (20 ln(3)) * (1/gamma' )\n\nSo,\n\n(20 ln(3)) * (1/gamma' ) ) = ln(3/2 )\n\nSo,\n\n(20 ln(3) ) / gamma' = ln(3/2 )\n\nSolve for gamma':\n\ngamma' = (20 ln(3)) / ln(3/2 )\n\nCompute the values:\n\nln(3) \u2248 1.0986\n\nln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = (20 * 1.0986 ) / 0.4055 \u2248 (21.972) / 0.4055 \u2248 approximately 54.16.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, option B is 68, etc. So the needed Lorentz factor is approximately 54, which is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand what's being asked. Hmm, particles are collided in a detector, and some of the new particles decay quickly. The setup is that when they collide, particles are produced which travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.\n\nWait, okay, so I think this has to do with the particles' lifetime and how far they can travel before decaying. Because if they decay quickly, maybe their lifetime is shorter, so they can only reach a certain distance before decaying. If the detector is 30 meters in radius, then the particles that reach the inner walls must have a longer lifetime or higher speed to cover that distance before decaying.\n\nI remember that for particles moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma times their proper lifetime. So gamma is the Lorentz factor. So if the proper lifetime is tau, then the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nThe distance a particle travels before decaying would be its speed multiplied by the time it lives. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, I can approximate the speed as the speed of light, c. So the distance L is approximately c * gamma * tau.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that at a Lorentz factor of 20, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So let's think about that. The particles that reach the walls are those that have a lifetime long enough for them to travel 30 meters.\n\nWait, no, actually, the detector radius is 30 meters. So the particles produced at the center need to travel 30 meters to reach the wall. So for a particle to reach the wall, the distance they need to cover is 30 meters. So the time they have to live is the time it takes light to travel 30 meters, but wait, no, because they are moving at speed v. Oh wait, but if they're ultra-relativistic, v is nearly c, so let's just approximate v as c.\n\nSo the time t is distance divided by speed: t = L / v \u2248 L / c. So t \u2248 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds? Wait, but perhaps I should express it more accurately.\n\nBut the key point is that the proper lifetime tau is related to the lab frame lifetime by gamma = t_lab / tau. So tau = t_lab / gamma.\n\nBut wait, the particles that decay before reaching the wall don't make it. So the fraction that reach the wall depends on the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.\n\nSo the probability P that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that its lifetime is longer than t = L / v. Since v is about c, t \u2248 L/(c).\n\nSo P = probability that tau' (the proper lifetime) > t / gamma. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.\n\nIn the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). The time it takes to reach the wall is t = L / v \u2248 L / c. So the particle will reach the wall only if its lifetime in the lab frame is longer than t.\n\nSo the condition is gamma * tau > t. So gamma > t/(tau).\n\nBut the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than t is the same as the probability that gamma * tau > t, which is the same as gamma > t/(tau).\n\nWait, but tau is the mean proper lifetime. Hmm, but maybe I should model this as a decay process. The decay follows an exponential distribution. So the probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/tau), where tau is the mean lifetime.\n\nSo the probability that the particle reaches the wall is P = exp(-t/(gamma * tau)).\n\nWait, because in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma*tau, so the probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no, wait. In the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. So the decay time in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed yet after time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nBut t is the time it takes to reach the wall. So t = L/(v) \u2248 L/c, since v is close to c.\n\nSo P = exp( - L/(c gamma tau) )\n\nIn the given scenario, when gamma is 20, the probability P is 1/3. So:\n\n1/3 = exp( - (30 m) / (c * 20 tau) )\n\nWe can solve for tau in terms of gamma=20.\n\nTaking natural logs on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = - (30)/(20 c tau)\n\nSo ln(1/3) is negative, which makes sense.\n\nln(1/3) \u2248 -1.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n-1.0986 = - (30)/(20 c tau)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n1.0986 \u2248 30/(20 c tau)\n\nSo,\n\n20 c tau * 1.0986 \u224830\n\nWait, wait, let me re-arrange.\n\n(30) / (20 c tau) ) = 1.0986\n\nSo,\n\n(30)/(20 c tau) ) = ln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nWait, wait, ln(3) is approximately 1.0986, right. So,\n\n(30)/(20 c tau) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\n(3)/(2 c tau) ) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\nc tau = 3/( 2 ln(3) )\n\nCalculate that:\n\nln(3) is about 1.0986, so 2*1.0986 \u2248 2.1972.\n\n3 divided by 2.1972 is approximately 1.367.\n\nSo c tau \u2248 1.367 meters.\n\nWait, so tau is 1.367 / c seconds. Since c is about 3e8 m/s, tau is 1.367/(3e8) \u2248 4.557e-9 seconds.\n\nBut wait, maybe I don't need to calculate tau numerically. Because when we have the second scenario, where the probability is 2/3, we can set up the equation again.\n\nIn the second case, the desired probability is 2/3, so:\n\n2/3 = exp( - (30)/(c gamma' tau) )\n\nTaking ln on both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = - (30)/(c gamma' tau)\n\nSo,\n\nln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\n-0.4055 = - (30)/(c gamma' tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n0.4055 = 30/( c gamma' tau )\n\nBut from the first case, we found that 30/(c gamma tau) ) = ln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nWait, no, earlier, when gamma was 20, the equation was:\n\n30/(20 c tau) = ln(3).\n\nSo,\n\n30/(c tau) = 20 ln(3).\n\nSo,\n\nc tau = 30/(20 ln(3)) = 3/(2 ln(3)) \u2248 1.367 m, which is what I had before.\n\nSo in the second case,\n\n30/(c gamma' tau) ) = (30)/(c tau) * (1/gamma') )\n\n= (20 ln(3)) ) * (1/gamma' )\n\nBecause from the first case, 30/(c tau) = 20 ln(3).\n\nWait, let me see: from the first case,\n\n30/(20 c tau) ) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\n30/(c tau) ) = 20 ln(3)\n\nSo, 30/(c gamma' tau) ) = (20 ln(3)) / gamma'\n\nSo,\n\n(20 ln(3)) / gamma' ) = ln(3) * (20 / gamma' ) )\n\nWait, wait, maybe not. Let me go back.\n\nWe have the equation for the second case:\n\n30/(c gamma' tau) ) = ln(3) * (30/(c tau) ) / (20 gamma' )\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think differently.\n\nWe have from the first case:\n\n(30) / (c tau * 20) ) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\n30/(c tau) = 20 ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\nc tau = 30/(20 ln(3)) = 3/(2 ln(3)) \u2248 1.367 m.\n\nSo in the second case,\n\n30/(c gamma' tau) ) = (30) / (gamma' * c tau )\n\nSubstituting c tau from the first case,\n\n= 30 / (gamma' * (3/(2 ln(3))) )\n\n= (30 * 2 ln(3)) ) / (gamma' * 3 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (60 ln(3)) / (3 gamma' )\n\n= 20 ln(3) / gamma'\n\nSo,\n\n30/(c gamma' tau) ) = 20 ln(3) / gamma'\n\nBut in the second case, the equation is:\n\n(30)/(c gamma' tau) ) = ln(3) * (30/(c tau) ) / (20 gamma' )\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me write the equations again.\n\nFrom first case:\n\n30/(20 c tau) = ln(3) --> equation (1)\n\nFrom second case:\n\n30/(gamma' c tau) = ln( (2/3) )? No, wait no.\n\nWait, the second case's equation is:\n\nexp( - (30)/(gamma' c tau) ) ) = 2/3\n\nWait no, no. Wait, the general equation is:\n\nP = exp( - (30)/(gamma c tau) )\n\nIn the first case, P=1/3, gamma=20:\n\n1/3 = exp( -30/(20 c tau) )\n\nTaking ln both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau )\n\nSo,\n\n30/(20 c tau ) = - ln(1/3) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\n30/(20 c tau ) = ln(3) --> equation (1)\n\nIn the second case, P=2/3:\n\n2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma' c tau) )\n\nTake ln:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(gamma' c tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n- ln(2/3) = 30/(gamma' c tau )\n\nSo,\n\n30/(gamma' c tau ) = ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055\n\nBut from equation (1):\n\n30/(20 c tau ) = ln(3) --> 30/(c tau ) = 20 ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\n30/(c tau ) = 20 ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\n30/(gamma' c tau ) = (30/(c tau )) ) * (1/gamma' )\n\n= (20 ln(3)) * (1/gamma' )\n\nSo,\n\n(20 ln(3)) * (1/gamma' ) ) = ln(3/2 )\n\nSo,\n\n(20 ln(3) ) / gamma' = ln(3/2 )\n\nSolve for gamma':\n\ngamma' = (20 ln(3)) / ln(3/2 )\n\nCompute the values:\n\nln(3) \u2248 1.0986\n\nln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = (20 * 1.0986 ) / 0.4055 \u2248 (21.972) / 0.4055 \u2248 approximately 54.16.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, option B is 68, etc. So the needed Lorentz factor is approximately 54, which is option A.\n\n\nTo determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the particles' lifetimes and their travel distance. The key equations involve the exponential decay probability and relativistic time dilation.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relativistic Lifetime and Decay Probability**:\n   - The probability \\( P \\) that a particle reaches the detector's inner walls is given by:\n     \\[\n     P = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\gamma \\tau c}\\right)\n     \\]\n     where:\n     - \\( L = 30 \\, \\text{m} \\) is the distance to the detector's inner wall,\n     - \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor,\n     - \\( \\tau \\) is the proper lifetime of the particle,\n     - \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\n2. **First Case (\\( \\gamma = 20 \\), \\( P = \\frac{1}{3} \\))**:\n   - Substituting \\( P = \\frac{1}{3} \\) and \\( \\gamma = 20 \\) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{3} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{30}{20 \\tau c}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Taking the natural logarithm:\n     \\[\n     \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{30}{20 \\tau c}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{30}{20 \\tau c} = \\ln(3) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{30}{\\tau c} = 20 \\ln(3)\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( \\tau c \\):\n     \\[\n     \\tau c = \\frac{30}{20 \\ln(3)} = \\frac{3}{2 \\ln(3)} \\approx 1.367 \\, \\text{m}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Second Case (\\( P = \\frac{2}{3} \\))**:\n   - For \\( P = \\frac{2}{3} \\), the equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{3} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{30}{\\gamma' \\tau c}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Taking the natural logarithm:\n     \\[\n     \\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{30}{\\gamma' \\tau c}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{30}{\\gamma' \\tau c} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( \\tau c = \\frac{3}{2 \\ln(3)} \\) from the first case:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{30}{\\gamma'} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{2 \\ln(3)}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{30}{\\gamma'} \\cdot \\frac{2 \\ln(3)}{3} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{20 \\ln(3)}{\\gamma'} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( \\gamma' \\):\n     \\[\n     \\gamma' = \\frac{20 \\ln(3)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)}\n     \\]\n   - Using approximate values (\\( \\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986 \\), \\( \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\approx 0.4055 \\)):\n     \\[\n     \\gamma' \\approx \\frac{20 \\cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \\approx 54.16.\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe required Lorentz factor is approximately \\( 54 \\), which corresponds to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me read it again. So, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.\n\nWait, I think I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma relates to how much time dilation occurs. Oh right, but wait, particles moving at high speeds will experience less time, so from the lab frame (the detector's frame), they'll travel a certain distance before decaying.\n\nSo, the key here is the proper time versus the lab frame time. The particles are moving at a speed where their lifetime is longer in the lab frame due to gamma. That allows them to reach the detector walls.\n\nLet me think. The radius is 30 meters. So, the distance from the center to the wall is 30 m. The particles are moving at speed v, which is related to gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo, in the lab frame, the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by the speed. So, t = 30 / v.\n\nThe particle's lifetime in its rest frame is tau (proper time), and in the lab frame, it's gamma * tau. So, the particle will decay if the time t is greater than gamma * tau. Wait, no, wait: the lifetime in the lab is longer. So, the condition for the particle to reach the detector wall is that the time it takes to reach the wall is less than its lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nWait, no, the other way around. The particle's lifetime is tau in its rest frame. So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So, the time available (t) must be less than gamma * tau for the particle to reach the detector. Because if t < gamma tau, then the particle has enough time to reach the wall before decaying.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. If the time taken t is less than gamma tau, then the particle will reach the wall. Because the particle's lifetime is longer from our frame's perspective.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So, the time available for the particle to reach the wall is t = 30/(v). So, if t < gamma tau, then the particle doesn't have enough time to reach the wall before decaying. Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, if the particle's lifetime is gamma tau, then the maximum distance it can travel before decaying is v * gamma tau. So, the maximum distance is v * gamma tau.\n\nSo, for the particle to reach the detector wall, the distance (30 m) must be less than or equal to v * gamma tau. So, 30 <= v gamma tau.\n\nWait, but what's tau? Tau is the proper lifetime of the particle. So, for the initial case, when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the wall. So, that suggests that only one third have a lifetime long enough to reach the wall. Wait, but that's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of particles that reach the wall depends on the fraction that have a lifetime longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.\n\nSo, the fraction f is the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than t, which is the time to reach the wall.\n\nSo, f = P(tau > t / gamma) ?\n\nWait, no. Let's think in terms of the lab frame. The particle's lifetime is gamma tau. So, the time it has to reach the wall is t = 30 / v.\n\nSo, if t < gamma tau, the particle will decay before reaching the wall. So, the fraction that reach the wall is the fraction of particles whose gamma tau > t.\n\nWait, no, that's the opposite. Because if the particle's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall, it will reach the wall. So, the probability that the particle lives longer than t is the fraction that reach the wall.\n\nSo, f = P(gamma tau > t).\n\nWait, but tau is a fixed value for the particle. So, maybe it's the distribution of the particle's proper lifetimes. Hmm, perhaps we can model this as a decay process where the lifetime in the lab is gamma tau, and the particles are moving at speed v.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the survival probability. The number of particles that reach the wall is the number of particles whose lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall. So, if the particle's proper lifetime is tau, then the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. The time to reach the wall is t = 30 / v.\n\nSo, the condition is gamma tau > t. So, gamma tau > 30 / v.\n\nWait, but v is related to gamma. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), so v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) * c.\n\nAssuming c is approximately 3e8 m/s, but maybe we can work in terms of beta, where beta = v/c. So, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo, t = 30 / (beta c).\n\nSo, the condition becomes gamma tau > 30/(beta c).\n\nBut tau is the proper lifetime, which is fixed for the particle. So, when gamma is 20, the fraction of particles that reach the wall is 1/3. So, perhaps this is a Poisson process or exponential decay, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a simple ratio based on gamma.\n\nWait, maybe the fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on how much their gamma tau exceeds the time t. So, for a given gamma, the fraction f is the probability that tau > t/(gamma). But since tau is a fixed proper lifetime, perhaps it's more about the fraction of particles that have a lifetime longer than t/gamma. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction is determined by the ratio of the maximum possible distance a particle can travel before decaying, divided by the detector radius. So, the maximum distance is v gamma tau. So, the fraction f is (v gamma tau) / (30 m) >= 1? No, because that would be 100% if the maximum distance is >= 30 m.\n\nBut in the problem, when gamma is 20, only one third reach the wall. So, perhaps the average is considered. Wait, maybe the particles are distributed in their decay lengths, and the fraction that reach the wall is the probability that their decay length is longer than 30 m.\n\nSo, the decay length L is v gamma tau. So, the fraction f is the probability that L > 30 m.\n\nBut how do we model that? If L is a random variable, perhaps it's a Gaussian distribution or something else. But I think in this problem, we can model it as the average.\n\nWait, maybe the number of particles that reach the wall is proportional to the decay length divided by the detector radius. So, if L is the average decay length, then the fraction f is L / R, where R is 30 m.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So, when L > R, the fraction f is (L/R) * some function. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the decay length is L = v gamma tau, then the fraction f is the probability that L >= R. But if L is fixed, then f is 1 if L >= R, else 0. But in reality, perhaps the decay length is a random variable, so the fraction f would be the ratio of L to R. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the initial scenario. Gamma is 20, and one third (1/3) reach the wall. So, maybe the fraction is (gamma) / (gamma_initial) ) * something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction of particles that reach the wall is f = 1 - (R / L), where L is the average decay length. So, when L is much larger than R, almost all particles reach the wall.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose L is the average decay length. Then, the number of particles that decay before reaching the wall would be proportional to (R / L), assuming that the decay follows an exponential distribution.\n\nWait, perhaps the fraction that decay before reaching the wall is (1 - exp(-R/(L)) ), but that's getting into more complex probability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for a simple case, the fraction that reach the wall is (L / (L + R)), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this from the time perspective. The time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is t = R/(v) = 30/(v).\n\nThe lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is gamma tau. So, the probability that the particle survives (i.e., doesn't decay) during time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, that's the exponential decay formula. So, the probability of the particle not decaying (surviving) is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo, the fraction f of particles that reach the wall is exp(- t/(gamma tau) ) = exp( - (30/(v)) / (gamma tau) ).\n\nBut tau is the proper lifetime, which is a fixed value for the particles. So, the expression simplifies to exp( -30/(v gamma tau) ).\n\nWait, but v is related to gamma. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)), so v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo, beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo, v = beta c.\n\nPutting that into the time expression: t = 30/(beta c).\n\nSo, the exponent becomes:\n\n30/(beta c) / (gamma tau) = 30/(beta c gamma tau).\n\nWait, but beta c gamma is equal to gamma\u00b2, because beta c = v, and gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta c gamma = v gamma = (v)/(sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) ) = v/(sqrt( (c\u00b2 - v\u00b2)/c\u00b2 )) ) = v c / sqrt(c\u00b2 - v\u00b2) ) = v c / (c sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) ) = v / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) ) = gamma v. Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nAlternatively, let's express beta in terms of gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo, beta = sqrt( (gamma\u00b2 - 1)/gamma\u00b2 ) ) = sqrt( gamma\u00b2 - 1 ) / gamma.\n\nSo, beta c = c sqrt( gamma\u00b2 - 1 ) / gamma.\n\nSo, 30/(v) = 30/(beta c) = 30 gamma / (c sqrt( gamma\u00b2 - 1 )) )\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can relate beta and gamma in a way that simplifies the expression.\n\nSo, the fraction f is exp( - 30/(v gamma tau) ) = exp( -30/( beta c gamma tau ) )\n\nWait, but since beta c gamma = gamma v, and v gamma = gamma^2 beta.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me try to plug in numbers.\n\nIn the initial case, when gamma is 20, the fraction f is 1/3. So,\n\n1/3 = exp( - 30/( beta * c * gamma * tau ) )\n\nHmm, but I don't know the value of tau. So, perhaps I can set up a ratio.\n\nLet\u2019s denote gamma_initial = 20, and f_initial = 1/3.\n\nSo,\n\n1/3 = exp( - 30/( beta_initial * c * gamma_initial * tau ) )\n\nSimilarly, for the new gamma, gamma_new, f_new = 2/3.\n\n2/3 = exp( - 30/( beta_new * c * gamma_new * tau ) )\n\nIf I take the ratio of these two equations:\n\n(2/3)/(1/3) = exp( [ -30/( beta_new c gamma_new tau ) ] + [ 30/( beta_initial c gamma_initial tau ) ] )\n\nSo,\n\n2 = exp( 30/(c tau) [ 1/(beta_initial gamma_initial ) - 1/(beta_new gamma_new) ] )\n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:\n\nln 2 = (30/(c tau)) [ 1/(beta_initial gamma_initial ) - 1/(beta_new gamma_new) ]\n\nHmm, but I don't know c, tau, or the beta values. So, perhaps I need to find a relationship between gamma_initial and gamma_new that makes the fraction f change from 1/3 to 2/3.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find a way to eliminate tau and c.\n\nLet me define a term K = 30/(c tau).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me read it again. So, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.\n\nWait, I think I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma relates to how much time dilation occurs. Oh right, but wait, particles moving at high speeds will experience less time, so from the lab frame (the detector's frame), they'll travel a certain distance before decaying.\n\nSo, the key here is the proper time versus the lab frame time. The particles are moving at a speed where their lifetime is longer in the lab frame due to gamma. That allows them to reach the detector walls.\n\nLet me think. The radius is 30 meters. So, the distance from the center to the wall is 30 m. The particles are moving at speed v, which is related to gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nSo, in the lab frame, the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by the speed. So, t = 30 / v.\n\nThe particle's lifetime in its rest frame is tau (proper time), and in the lab frame, it's gamma * tau. So, the particle will decay if the time t is greater than gamma * tau. Wait, no, wait: the lifetime in the lab is longer. So, the condition for the particle to reach the detector wall is that the time it takes to reach the wall is less than its lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nWait, no, the other way around. The particle's lifetime is tau in its rest frame. So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So, the time available (t) must be less than gamma * tau for the particle to reach the detector. Because if t < gamma tau, then the particle has enough time to reach the wall before decaying.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. If the time taken t is less than gamma tau, then the particle will reach the wall. Because the particle's lifetime is longer from our frame's perspective.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So, the time available for the particle to reach the wall is t = 30/(v). So, if t < gamma tau, then the particle doesn't have enough time to reach the wall before decaying. Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, if the particle's lifetime is gamma tau, then the maximum distance it can travel before decaying is v * gamma tau. So, the maximum distance is v * gamma tau.\n\nSo, for the particle to reach the detector wall, the distance (30 m) must be less than or equal to v * gamma tau. So, 30 <= v gamma tau.\n\nWait, but what's tau? Tau is the proper lifetime of the particle. So, for the initial case, when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the wall. So, that suggests that only one third have a lifetime long enough to reach the wall. Wait, but that's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of particles that reach the wall depends on the fraction that have a lifetime longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.\n\nSo, the fraction f is the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than t, which is the time to reach the wall.\n\nSo, f = P(tau > t / gamma) ?\n\nWait, no. Let's think in terms of the lab frame. The particle's lifetime is gamma tau. So, the time it has to reach the wall is t = 30 / v.\n\nSo, if t < gamma tau, the particle will decay before reaching the wall. So, the fraction that reach the wall is the fraction of particles whose gamma tau > t.\n\nWait, no, that's the opposite. Because if the particle's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall, it will reach the wall. So, the probability that the particle lives longer than t is the fraction that reach the wall.\n\nSo, f = P(gamma tau > t).\n\nWait, but tau is a fixed value for the particle. So, maybe it's the distribution of the particle's proper lifetimes. Hmm, perhaps we can model this as a decay process where the lifetime in the lab is gamma tau, and the particles are moving at speed v.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the survival probability. The number of particles that reach the wall is the number of particles whose lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall. So, if the particle's proper lifetime is tau, then the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. The time to reach the wall is t = 30 / v.\n\nSo, the condition is gamma tau > t. So, gamma tau > 30 / v.\n\nWait, but v is related to gamma. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), so v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) * c.\n\nAssuming c is approximately 3e8 m/s, but maybe we can work in terms of beta, where beta = v/c. So, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo, t = 30 / (beta c).\n\nSo, the condition becomes gamma tau > 30/(beta c).\n\nBut tau is the proper lifetime, which is fixed for the particle. So, when gamma is 20, the fraction of particles that reach the wall is 1/3. So, perhaps this is a Poisson process or exponential decay, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a simple ratio based on gamma.\n\nWait, maybe the fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on how much their gamma tau exceeds the time t. So, for a given gamma, the fraction f is the probability that tau > t/(gamma). But since tau is a fixed proper lifetime, perhaps it's more about the fraction of particles that have a lifetime longer than t/gamma. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction is determined by the ratio of the maximum possible distance a particle can travel before decaying, divided by the detector radius. So, the maximum distance is v gamma tau. So, the fraction f is (v gamma tau) / (30 m) >= 1? No, because that would be 100% if the maximum distance is >= 30 m.\n\nBut in the problem, when gamma is 20, only one third reach the wall. So, perhaps the average is considered. Wait, maybe the particles are distributed in their decay lengths, and the fraction that reach the wall is the probability that their decay length is longer than 30 m.\n\nSo, the decay length L is v gamma tau. So, the fraction f is the probability that L > 30 m.\n\nBut how do we model that? If L is a random variable, perhaps it's a Gaussian distribution or something else. But I think in this problem, we can model it as the average.\n\nWait, maybe the number of particles that reach the wall is proportional to the decay length divided by the detector radius. So, if L is the average decay length, then the fraction f is L / R, where R is 30 m.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So, when L > R, the fraction f is (L/R) * some function. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the decay length is L = v gamma tau, then the fraction f is the probability that L >= R. But if L is fixed, then f is 1 if L >= R, else 0. But in reality, perhaps the decay length is a random variable, so the fraction f would be the ratio of L to R. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the initial scenario. Gamma is 20, and one third (1/3) reach the wall. So, maybe the fraction is (gamma) / (gamma_initial) ) * something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction of particles that reach the wall is f = 1 - (R / L), where L is the average decay length. So, when L is much larger than R, almost all particles reach the wall.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose L is the average decay length. Then, the number of particles that decay before reaching the wall would be proportional to (R / L), assuming that the decay follows an exponential distribution.\n\nWait, perhaps the fraction that decay before reaching the wall is (1 - exp(-R/(L)) ), but that's getting into more complex probability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for a simple case, the fraction that reach the wall is (L / (L + R)), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this from the time perspective. The time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is t = R/(v) = 30/(v).\n\nThe lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is gamma tau. So, the probability that the particle survives (i.e., doesn't decay) during time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, that's the exponential decay formula. So, the probability of the particle not decaying (surviving) is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo, the fraction f of particles that reach the wall is exp(- t/(gamma tau) ) = exp( - (30/(v)) / (gamma tau) ).\n\nBut tau is the proper lifetime, which is a fixed value for the particles. So, the expression simplifies to exp( -30/(v gamma tau) ).\n\nWait, but v is related to gamma. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)), so v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo, beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo, v = beta c.\n\nPutting that into the time expression: t = 30/(beta c).\n\nSo, the exponent becomes:\n\n30/(beta c) / (gamma tau) = 30/(beta c gamma tau).\n\nWait, but beta c gamma is equal to gamma\u00b2, because beta c = v, and gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta c gamma = v gamma = (v)/(sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) ) = v/(sqrt( (c\u00b2 - v\u00b2)/c\u00b2 )) ) = v c / sqrt(c\u00b2 - v\u00b2) ) = v c / (c sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) ) = v / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) ) = gamma v. Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nAlternatively, let's express beta in terms of gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo, beta = sqrt( (gamma\u00b2 - 1)/gamma\u00b2 ) ) = sqrt( gamma\u00b2 - 1 ) / gamma.\n\nSo, beta c = c sqrt( gamma\u00b2 - 1 ) / gamma.\n\nSo, 30/(v) = 30/(beta c) = 30 gamma / (c sqrt( gamma\u00b2 - 1 )) )\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can relate beta and gamma in a way that simplifies the expression.\n\nSo, the fraction f is exp( - 30/(v gamma tau) ) = exp( -30/( beta c gamma tau ) )\n\nWait, but since beta c gamma = gamma v, and v gamma = gamma^2 beta.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me try to plug in numbers.\n\nIn the initial case, when gamma is 20, the fraction f is 1/3. So,\n\n1/3 = exp( - 30/( beta * c * gamma * tau ) )\n\nHmm, but I don't know the value of tau. So, perhaps I can set up a ratio.\n\nLet\u2019s denote gamma_initial = 20, and f_initial = 1/3.\n\nSo,\n\n1/3 = exp( - 30/( beta_initial * c * gamma_initial * tau ) )\n\nSimilarly, for the new gamma, gamma_new, f_new = 2/3.\n\n2/3 = exp( - 30/( beta_new * c * gamma_new * tau ) )\n\nIf I take the ratio of these two equations:\n\n(2/3)/(1/3) = exp( [ -30/( beta_new c gamma_new tau ) ] + [ 30/( beta_initial c gamma_initial tau ) ] )\n\nSo,\n\n2 = exp( 30/(c tau) [ 1/(beta_initial gamma_initial ) - 1/(beta_new gamma_new) ] )\n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:\n\nln 2 = (30/(c tau)) [ 1/(beta_initial gamma_initial ) - 1/(beta_new gamma_new) ]\n\nHmm, but I don't know c, tau, or the beta values. So, perhaps I need to find a relationship between gamma_initial and gamma_new that makes the fraction f change from 1/3 to 2/3.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find a way to eliminate tau and c.\n\nLet me define a term K = 30/(c tau). Then,\n\nln 2 = K [ 1/( beta_initial gamma_initial ) - 1/( beta_new gamma_new ) ]\n\nBut K is a constant for a given setup, so it's the same for both cases.\n\nBut I don't know K. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's compute the term for the initial case.\n\nIn the initial case, gamma_initial =20.\n\nSo,\n\n1/3 = exp( - K / ( beta_initial gamma_initial ) )\n\nTake natural log:\n\nln(1/3) = - K / ( beta_initial gamma_initial )\n\nSo,\n\nK = - beta_initial gamma_initial / ln(3)\n\nWait, ln(1/3) is -ln 3, so that becomes K = beta_initial gamma_initial ln 3 / 1.\n\nWait,\n\nln(1/3) = - ln 3, so:\n\n- ln 3 = - K / ( beta_initial gamma_initial )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nln 3 = K / ( beta_initial gamma_initial )\n\nSo,\n\nK = beta_initial gamma_initial ln 3\n\nNow, substituting into the second equation (for gamma_new):\n\nln 2 = K [ 1/( beta_initial gamma_initial ) - 1/( beta_new gamma_new ) ]\n\nSubstituting K:\n\nln 2 = (beta_initial gamma_initial ln3 ) [ 1/(beta_initial gamma_initial) - 1/(beta_new gamma_new) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nln 2 = ln3 [ 1 - (beta_initial gamma_initial )/(beta_new gamma_new) ) ]\n\nHmm, that's:\n\nln 2 / ln 3 = 1 - [ (beta_initial gamma_initial ) / ( beta_new gamma_new ) ]\n\nSo,\n\n[ (beta_initial gamma_initial ) / ( beta_new gamma_new ) ] = 1 - (ln 2 / ln 3 )\n\nCompute the right-hand side:\n\nln 2 \u2248 0.6931, ln3 \u2248 1.0986.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.\n\nHmm. So I think this has to do with how far the particles travel before decaying. Because if a particle decays, it won't reach the detector walls. So, the particles that reach the walls must have a longer lifetime, which is affected by their Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, right. The proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma to get the dilated lifetime in the lab frame. So, the lifetime in the lab is gamma times the proper lifetime.\n\nSo the particles are moving at a speed where their gamma is 20. Now, the ones that reach the detector walls must have a longer lifetime such that they can travel the distance before decaying.\n\nWait, but the problem states that at gamma=20, only one third reach the inner walls. So maybe the probability of reaching is related to the ratio of the lifetime to the time it takes to reach the wall.\n\nLet me think. The particles are produced at the center of the detector, so the distance they need to travel to reach the inner wall is the radius, which is 30 meters. So the time they have to reach the wall is the distance divided by their speed.\n\nWait, but since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So the time t is approximately (30 m) / (c). Let me compute that. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds. So t \u2248 1e-7 seconds.\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime, tau. So t_lab = gamma * tau.\n\nBut for the particles to reach the wall, their lifetime must be at least the time it takes to reach the wall. Wait, no. Actually, the particles have a probability of decaying at any point in their lifetime. So the number that reach the wall depends on the ratio of the distance they can travel before decaying.\n\nWait, another approach. The average distance a particle travels before decaying is the product of its speed and its lifetime. So L = v * gamma * tau. But since v is approximately c, L = c * gamma * tau.\n\nWait, but the average lifetime is gamma tau, so the average distance is c * gamma tau. So if the average distance is larger than the detector's radius, more particles will reach the walls.\n\nWait, but the problem says that at gamma=20, one third reach the walls. So for gamma=20, the average distance they travel is c * 20 tau. If the detector radius is 30 meters, then the average distance when gamma is 20 is 30 meters times 3? Because only one third reach. Hmm, wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the fraction that reach the wall is the ratio of the detector radius to the average decay length. So if L is the average decay length, then the fraction f is (R / L) * something. Or perhaps, the probability that a particle doesn't decay before reaching the wall is e^(-R/(c gamma tau)).\n\nWait, right! The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-t/(tau_lab)), where tau_lab = gamma tau. But the time t it takes to reach the wall is R/(c beta), but since beta is approximately 1 for ultra-relativistic speeds, t \u2248 R/(c).\n\nSo the survival probability P is e^(-R/(c gamma tau)).\n\nSo, when gamma is 20, the survival probability is e^(-30/(c *20 * tau)) = 1/3. Because one third reach the wall.\n\nWait, so let me write that equation. Let me define some variables.\n\nLet me set R = 30 m.\n\nAt gamma = gamma1 = 20, the survival probability P1 = 1/3.\n\nSo,\n\nP1 = exp( - R/(c * gamma1 * tau) ) = 1/3.\n\nWe can take the natural log of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = - R/(c gamma1 tau )\n\nSo,\n\nR/(c gamma1 tau ) = ln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nWait, because ln(1/3) = - ln(3), so negative of that is ln(3).\n\nSo,\n\nR/(c gamma1 tau ) = ln(3).\n\nThen, for the new gamma, gamma2, we want the survival probability P2 = 2/3.\n\nSo,\n\nP2 = exp( - R/(c gamma2 tau) ) = 2/3.\n\nTaking natural logs:\n\nln(2/3) = - R/(c gamma2 tau )\n\nWhich gives:\n\nR/(c gamma2 tau ) = ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nWait, wait, because ln(2/3) is negative, so:\n\n- R/(c gamma2 tau) = ln(2/3) \u2192 R/(c gamma2 tau) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nBut from the first equation, R/(c gamma tau) for gamma1=20 is ln(3). So,\n\nFor gamma1:\n\nR/(c * gamma1 tau) = ln(3).\n\nFor gamma2:\n\nR/(c gamma2 tau) = ln(3/2).\n\nSo, taking the ratio of these two equations:\n\n(R/(c gamma2 tau)) / (R/(c gamma1 tau)) ) = [ln(3/2)] / [ln(3)].\n\nSimplify:\n\n( gamma1 / gamma2 ) = [ ln(3) ] / [ ln(3/2) ]\n\nBecause R, c, tau are the same in both.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma2 = gamma1 * [ ln(3/2) / ln(3) ]\n\nLet me compute the values.\n\nln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma2 = 20 * (0.4055 / 1.0986) \u2248 20 * 0.369 \u2248 7.38.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the original gamma is 20, and the new gamma is lower? But wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Wait, because when gamma increases, the survival probability increases because the particles live longer. So if we want more particles (two-thirds) to reach the wall, the survival probability must be higher. So gamma needs to be higher than 20.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, in the first case, when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So to have a higher survival probability (2/3), gamma must be higher. So I think I might have messed up the equations.\n\nWait, let's reevaluate.\n\nThe survival probability is P = e^(-R/(c gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no, wait: the proper lifetime is tau, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. The time for the particle to reach the wall is R/(c beta). Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, beta \u2248 1, so t = R/(c).\n\nSo, the decay probability is proportional to t/(gamma tau). So the survival probability is e^(- t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo,\n\nP = e^(- R/(c gamma tau)).\n\nSo, for gamma=20, P=1/3.\n\nSo,\n\nln(1/3) = - R/(c * 20 tau )\n\n\u2192 R/(c * 20 tau ) = ln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nNow, for the new gamma, gamma2, we want P2 = 2/3.\n\nSo,\n\nln(2/3) = - R/(c gamma2 tau )\n\n\u2192 R/(c gamma2 tau ) = ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nSo, from the first equation, R/(c tau) = 20 * 1.0986.\n\nThen, in the second equation, R/(c gamma2 tau) = 0.4055 \u2192 (R/(c tau)) = gamma2 * 0.4055.\n\nBut R/(c tau) is 20 * 1.0986. So,\n\n20 * 1.0986 = gamma2 * 0.4055.\n\nSolving for gamma2:\n\ngamma2 = (20 * 1.0986 ) / 0.4055.\n\nCompute that:\n\n20 * 1.0986 \u2248 21.972.\n\nDivide by 0.4055: 21.972 / 0.4055 \u2248 54.16.\n\nSo gamma2 \u224854.16.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54.\n\nSo the answer should be A)54.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. It's about particles being collided in a detector and their Lorentz factors. I remember that Lorentz factor is gamma, which relates to how much time dilation and length contraction happens for moving objects.\n\nAlright, let me read the problem again. So, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and these are fast-decaying, moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters. The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds reach the walls?\n\nWait, so initially, with gamma ~20, only 1/3 make it. We want to find the gamma where 2/3 make it. I guess this has to do with how long the particles live before decaying. Because if they live longer, they can travel further.\n\nSo, the idea is that the particles' lifetime as measured in the lab frame is gamma times their proper lifetime. Proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So, the longer the lifetime (higher gamma), the further they can travel before decaying.\n\nThe detector's radius is 30 meters. So, the distance the particles need to travel is 30 meters. The time they have is the proper lifetime divided by gamma? Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nIn the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So, t_lab = gamma * t_proper. The speed of the particles is v, which is approximately c since they're ultra-relativistic. So, the distance they can travel is v * t_lab = c * gamma * t_proper.\n\nWait, but the particle's speed is v \u2248 c, so the distance they can move before decaying is roughly c * gamma * t_proper.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that only a third reach the walls when gamma is 20. So, maybe the distance they can travel is 30 meters for the particles that reach the walls. So, the faster they are (higher gamma), the more likely they are to reach the walls.\n\nWait, but the fraction that reach the walls depends on the product of speed and lifetime. Hmm, but since they're moving at speed v, and their lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime, the time they have is t = gamma * t_proper.\n\nSo, the particles that reach the walls must have their travel time less than or equal to their lifetime. So, the time to reach the wall is the distance divided by speed. Since v is approximately c, it's 30 m / c.\n\nSo, for a particle to reach the wall, gamma * t_proper must be >= 30/(c). Wait, but t_proper is the proper lifetime, which is a fixed value for each particle type.\n\nSo, when gamma is 20, only one third of the particles reach the wall. So, perhaps the proper lifetime is such that only a fraction of particles have gamma enough to reach the wall.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall. The decay is a Poisson process, so the probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(tau)), where tau is the mean lifetime.\n\nIn the lab frame, the mean lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau_proper.\n\nSo, the probability that a particle hasn't decayed when it's about to reach the wall (t = 30/c) is exp( - (30/c) / (gamma tau_proper) ).\n\nWait, but the problem states that one third reach the walls when gamma is 20. So, the probability is 1/3 when gamma is 20.\n\nSo, 1/3 = exp( - (30/c) / (gamma tau_proper) ), with gamma =20.\n\nThen, for the desired condition, the probability is 2/3, so 2/3 = exp( - (30/c) / (gamma_new tau_proper) ).\n\nI can set up the two equations:\n\nFor gamma =20: 1/3 = exp( - (30)/(20 tau_proper c) )\n\nFor gamma = gamma_new: 2/3 = exp( - (30)/(gamma_new tau_proper c) )\n\nWait, let me write that more clearly.\n\nLet me denote tau_proper as tau. So, when gamma is 20, the probability is 1/3.\n\nSo,\n\n1/3 = exp( - (30 m) / (gamma c tau) )\n\nWait, units: 30 m is distance. c is m/s. gamma is unitless. tau is in seconds.\n\nSo, the exponent is (30) / (gamma * c * tau) ) \u2192 units: (m) / ( (m/s) * s ) \u2192 m / (m) \u2192 unitless. That's correct.\n\nSo, equation 1: ln(1/3) = - (30)/(gamma c tau )\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: ln(2/3) = - (30)/(gamma_new c tau )\n\nSo, from equation 1: (30)/(gamma c tau ) = - ln(1/3) = ln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nFrom equation 2: (30)/(gamma_new c tau ) = ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nWait, because equation 2's right side is ln(2/3) \u2192 which is negative, so the left side is positive. So,\n\nEquation 2: (30)/(gamma_new c tau ) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nSo, let me write both:\n\nEquation 1: 30/(20 c tau) ) = ln(3) \u2192 30/(20 c tau) ) \u2248 1.0986 \u2192 c tau \u2248 30/(20 * 1.0986 ) \u2192 let's compute that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should relate equation 1 and equation 2.\n\nFrom equation 1: 30/(20 c tau) ) = ln(3) \u2192 30/(20 c tau) ) = a, where a is ln(3).\n\nEquation 2: 30/(gamma_new c tau) ) = ln(3/2) \u2192 let me write this as 30/(gamma_new c tau) ) = b, where b is ln(3/2).\n\nSo, from equation 1, c tau = 30/(20 a ) = 3/(2a )\n\nFrom equation 2, c tau = 30/(gamma_new b )\n\nSo, 3/(2a ) = 30/(gamma_new b )\n\nSolve for gamma_new.\n\nMultiply both sides by gamma_new b:\n\n3/(2a ) * gamma_new b = 30\n\ngamma_new = (30 * 2a ) / (3 b )\n\nSimplify:\n\ngamma_new = (60 a ) / (3 b ) ) \u2192 20 a / b.\n\nBecause a is ln(3) \u2248 1.0986, b is ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nSo, gamma_new = 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 \u2192 compute that.\n\nCompute 1.0986 / 0.4055 \u2248 2.708.\n\nSo, 20 * 2.708 \u2248 54.16.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 1.0986 / 0.4055:\n\nLet me do this division: 1.0986 \u00f7 0.4055.\n\nWell, 0.4055 * 2.7 = 1.09485. That's very close to 1.0986.\n\nThe difference is 1.0986 - 1.09485 = 0.00375.\n\nSo, 0.4055 * 2.7 + 0.4055 * x = 1.0986.\n\nSo, 0.4055 x = 0.00375 \u2192 x \u2248 0.00375 / 0.4055 \u2248 0.00925.\n\nSo, x\u22480.00925 \u2192 so 2.7 +0.00925 \u22482.70925.\n\nSo, 1.0986 / 0.4055 \u2248 2.70925.\n\nSo, gamma_new = 20 * 2.70925 \u2248 54.185.\n\nSo, approximately 54.185, so the closest option is A) 54.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, the initial setup: when gamma is 20, 1/3 reach the wall. So, the probability is 1/3.\n\nThe probability that a particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the wall is 1/3.\n\nSo, exp(-t/(tau_lab)) = 1/3.\n\nBut tau_lab is gamma * tau_proper.\n\nt is the time it takes to reach the wall, which is 30 m / (v), and v is approximately c. So, t\u224830/(c).\n\nSo, exp( - (30/(c)) / (gamma tau_proper) ) = 1/3.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for the new gamma, we have the same setup but the probability is 2/3.\n\nSo, 2/3 = exp( - (30/(c)) / (gamma_new tau_proper) )\n\nTaking natural logs:\n\nln(2/3) = - (30) / (gamma_new c tau_proper )\n\nWhich is the same as equation 2.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct. Thus, gamma_new is approximately 54.18, so the answer is A) 54.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.\n\nThe problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.\n\nNow, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.\n\nHmm, okay. So I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that the Lorentz factor (gamma) relates to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. The particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, so gamma is large.\n\nThe key here seems to be figuring out how the Lorentz factor affects the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls and whether they decay before doing so. Because if the particles decay, they won't reach the detector, right? So the number that reach the walls depends on their lifetime as observed in the lab frame.\n\nWait, the problem says that one third reach the walls when gamma is 20. So when gamma increases, more particles reach the walls. That makes sense because a higher gamma means less time dilation, or wait no\u2014time dilation makes the particles' lifetime longer from the lab's perspective. So with higher gamma, the particles live longer, so more of them have time to reach the walls.\n\nWait, no, the particles are moving at speed v, and the time they have to reach the wall is the lab frame's time. Let me think: The proper lifetime of the particle (in its rest frame) is tau. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the time available for the particle to travel from the center to the wall is t = R / v, where R is the radius of the detector (30 meters) and v is the particle's speed.\n\nThe particles will decay if their lifetime in the lab frame is less than the time it takes to reach the wall. So the probability of a particle decaying before reaching the wall is the ratio of the proper lifetime to the available time. Or wait, maybe the other way around. Let me get this straight.\n\nThe proper lifetime is tau. The lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma * tau. The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = R / v. If t < gamma * tau, then the particle doesn't decay and reaches the wall. Or wait, wait, no. If the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall, then it will reach the wall before decaying. Because if the particle lives longer, it has more time to travel. So the condition for reaching the wall is that gamma * tau >= t. So the fraction that reach the wall is the probability that the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the travel time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's modeled as a decay process, where the probability of a particle decaying before reaching the wall is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). But I'm not sure about the exact model. Alternatively, maybe it's approximated as the ratio of the travel time to the mean lifetime.\n\nWait, but in the given scenario, when gamma is 20, one third reach the walls. So the fraction that reach is 1/3. So the fraction that decay is 2/3. If the particles decay exponentially, the probability of decay before time t is P = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So P = 2/3 when gamma is 20. So 2/3 = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)), which implies exp(-t/(gamma tau)) = 1/3. Taking natural logs: -t/(gamma tau) = ln(1/3) = -ln3. So t/(gamma tau) = ln3.\n\nSo when gamma is 20, t/(20 tau) = ln3. So t = 20 tau ln3.\n\nBut wait, what's t? t is the time it takes to reach the wall, which is R/(v). Let me think about v in terms of gamma. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), but for ultra-relativistic speeds, v \u2248 c. So maybe we can approximate v \u2248 c, which would make the calculation easier.\n\nSo, t \u2248 R / c. So for R = 30 meters, t \u2248 30 / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds. Wait, but that's a very short time. Let me compute that:\n\n30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds. So t = 1e-7 s.\n\nWait, but then when gamma is 20, t = 20 tau ln3. So tau = t/(20 ln3). Let me compute tau.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering the ratio of the required gamma to the original gamma.\n\nIn the original case, gamma is 20, and 1/3 reach the wall. So the fraction that reach the wall is 1/3. So the fraction that decay is 2/3.\n\nThe probability of decay is P = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So 2/3 = 1 - exp(-t/(20 tau)) \u2192 exp(-t/(20 tau)) = 1/3 \u2192 -t/(20 tau) = ln(1/3) \u2192 t/(20 tau) = ln3 \u2192 tau = t/(20 ln3).\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the correct model. Alternatively, maybe the fraction is t/(gamma tau), but that would make sense if the decay follows an exponential distribution and the time is much less than the lifetime. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: The particles are moving at a speed v, and their lifetime is gamma tau. The time to reach the wall is t = R/(v). The probability that the particle doesn't decay before reaching the wall is P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, that makes sense because the decay follows an exponential process. So the probability of not decaying is exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So when gamma is 20, P = 1/3. So:\n\n1/3 = exp(- t/(20 tau)) \u2192 ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau) \u2192 t/(20 tau) = ln3 \u2192 t = 20 tau ln3.\n\nNow, the problem wants to find the gamma (let's say gamma') such that P' = 2/3. So:\n\n2/3 = exp(- t/(gamma' tau)) \u2192 ln(2/3) = -t/(gamma' tau) \u2192 t/(gamma' tau) = ln(3/2) \u2192 t = gamma' tau ln(3/2).\n\nWait, but from the first case, we have t = 20 tau ln3. So equate the two expressions for t:\n\n20 tau ln3 = gamma' tau ln(3/2) \u2192 20 ln3 = gamma' ln(3/2) \u2192 gamma' = [20 ln3 ] / ln(3/2)\n\nCompute that:\n\nln3 \u2248 1.0986\n\nln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055\n\nSo:\n\ngamma' = (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 \u2248 (21.972) / 0.4055 \u2248 54.15.\n\nWait, so about 54. So the answer would be option A)54.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me recheck the setup.\n\nIn the original case, 1/3 reach the wall, so P = 1/3. So exp(-t/(gamma tau)) = 1/3. So t/(gamma tau) = ln3.\n\nIn the new case, we want P_new = 2/3. So exp(-t/(gamma' tau)) = 2/3 \u2192 t/(gamma' tau) = ln(3/2).\n\nSo from the first equation: t = gamma tau ln3.\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n(gamma tau ln3) / (gamma' tau) ) = ln(3/2) \u2192 (gamma ln3) / gamma' = ln(3/2).\n\nSo gamma' = gamma * (ln3) / (ln(3/2)).\n\nGiven gamma is 20, so gamma' = 20 * (ln3)/(ln(3/2)).\n\nCalculating ln3 \u22481.0986, ln(3/2)\u22480.4055.\n\nSo 1.0986 / 0.4055 \u2248 2.708.\n\nSo gamma' \u224820 * 2.708 \u224854.16.\n\nWhich is approximately 54. So the correct answer is A)54.\n\nWait, but why is the original gamma 20 giving 1/3? Because when gamma is 20, the probability to reach the wall is 1/3, so the probability to decay is 2/3.\n\nWait, but according to the setup, when gamma is 20, 1/3 reach the walls, so P=1/3. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction is inversely proportional to gamma. But wait, the calculation gives 54, which is option A. So the answer should be A.\n",

So, the main idea here seems to be about the relationship between the particles' speed, their lifetime (due to time dilation), and the distance they travel before decaying. Since they're moving at relativistic speeds, time dilation must be a factor. \n\nI remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). At high velocities, gamma becomes large. Gamma affects time experienced by the moving particles, which would affect how far they travel before decaying.\n\nSo, particles with a higher gamma (higher velocity) will have a longer lifetime from our lab frame perspective. That means they can travel a longer distance before decaying. So, if a particle has a higher gamma, more of them might reach the detector's walls, because they take longer to decay and thus have more time to move further.\n\nWait, but in the problem, initially, at gamma = 20, only one third reach the walls. We need to find the gamma where two-thirds reach the walls. So, that suggests that at the higher gamma, more particles make it, which aligns with my previous thought.\n\nLet me think about the decay process. The proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is tau. From our lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. The distance a particle travels before decaying is v * t, where t is the lab frame lifetime. So, distance = v * gamma * tau.\n\nBut wait, v is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles. So, distance \u2248 c * gamma * tau.\n\nThe detector's radius is 30 meters, so particles that travel 30 meters or more reach the wall. So, for a particle to reach the wall, its decay length must be at least 30 meters. \n\nBut how does this relate to the fraction of particles that reach the wall? I think the fraction depends on the probability that the particle's decay occurs after it has traveled at least 30 meters. \n\nIn particle physics, the decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)). But since the particles are moving at speed v, the time t is distance/(v). So, the probability that a particle hasn't decayed when it's traveled a distance L is exp(-L/(v gamma tau)).\n\nWait, but v is approximately c, so L/(v gamma tau) \u2248 L/(c gamma tau). \n\nThe problem states that when gamma is 20, the average fraction reaching the wall is 1/3. So, 1/3 = exp(-30/(c * 20 * tau)).\n\nWait, let me clarify. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So, the probability P that a particle travels a distance L without decaying is P = exp(-L/(gamma tau c)), since distance L = v t, and t = gamma tau (if tau is the proper lifetime). But since v \u2248 c, L \u2248 c gamma tau t'.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. The average distance a particle travels before decaying is v * gamma * tau. Since v is approximately c, the average decay length is approximately c gamma tau.\n\nSo, for a given gamma, the average decay length is L_avg = c gamma tau.\n\nThe probability that a particle's decay length is greater than or equal to 30 meters is the same as the fraction that reaches the wall. So, that probability P is equal to the fraction reaching the wall.\n\nBut the decay follows an exponential distribution, so P = exp(-30 / L_avg) = exp(-30 / (c gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The decay length is a random variable. The probability that the decay occurs after traveling distance L is P = exp(-L/(c gamma tau)). Because the decay rate is 1/(gamma tau), so the survival probability after time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), and since t = L/c, it becomes exp(-L/(c gamma tau)).\n\nSo, when gamma = 20, the fraction reaching the wall is 1/3. So,\n\n1/3 = exp( -30 / (c * 20 * tau) )\n\nSimilarly, when gamma is higher, say gamma', the fraction becomes 2/3.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait a second, the problem states that when gamma is 20, one third reach the inner walls. So, that means P = 1/3 when gamma =20. We need to find gamma' where P =2/3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem is the opposite. At gamma=20, 1/3 reach the wall. We need to find the gamma where 2/3 reach the wall. So, that would happen when the decay length is longer, so higher gamma.\n\nSo, let's write the equations.\n\nAt gamma=20:\n\n1/3 = exp(-30/(c * 20 * tau)).\n\nWe can take the natural logarithm of both sides.\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 * tau)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n- ln(3) = -30/(20 c tau)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nln(3) = 30/(20 c tau)\n\nSo,\n\nln(3) = (3)/(2 c tau)\n\nSo, 2 c tau = 3 / ln(3)\n\nHmm, maybe we can compute 3/ln(3). Let's compute ln(3) \u2248 1.0986, so 3 / 1.0986 \u2248 2.73.\n\nSo,\n\n2 c tau \u2248 2.73\n\nThus,\n\nc tau \u2248 2.73 / 2 \u2248 1.365\n\nSo, c tau \u2248 1.365 meters.\n\nWait, but that's just a number, but perhaps we don't need to compute the exact value because we can set up a ratio.\n\nNow, for the new gamma', we have:\n\n2/3 = exp( -30/(c gamma' tau) )\n\nTake the natural log of both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(c gamma' tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n- ln(2/3) = 30/(c gamma' tau )\n\nBut ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 - 1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055. So, -ln(2/3) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\n0.4055 = 30/(c gamma' tau )\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for gamma':\n\ngamma' = 30/(0.4055 c tau )\n\nBut from earlier, we have c tau \u2248 1.365 meters.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = 30 / (0.4055 * 1.365 )\n\nCompute denominator: 0.4055 * 1.365 \u2248 Let's compute 0.4 *1.365 is 0.546, 0.0055*1.365 \u2248 0.0075, so total \u2248 0.5535.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' \u2248 30 / 0.5535 \u2248 Let's compute that.\n\n30 / 0.55 is approximately 54.545. Since 0.5535 is a bit more than 0.55, the actual value would be a bit less than 54.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, option C is 40, etc.\n\nWait, so approximately 54.5 would be close to option A (54) or B (68). Hmm. Wait, but wait, maybe my approximation is a bit rough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should do this algebraically without plugging in numbers early on.\n\nLet me write the two equations again.\n\nAt gamma = 20:\n\nP1 = 1/3 = exp( -30/(c gamma tau) )\n\nAt gamma' = ?:\n\nP2 = 2/3 = exp( -30/(c gamma' tau) )\n\nTake the ratio of P2 to P1:\n\n(2/3)/(1/3) = [exp( -30/(c gamma' tau) )] / [exp( -30/(c gamma tau) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 = exp( [ -30/(c gamma' tau) + 30/(c gamma tau) ] )\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\nln(2) = [30/(c gamma tau) - 30/(c gamma' tau) ]\n\nFactor out 30/(c tau):\n\nln(2) = (30/(c tau)) [ 1/(gamma) - 1/(gamma') ]\n\nFrom the first equation, when gamma=20:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c*20 tau )\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n30/(c tau) = - ln(1/3) * 20\n\nBut ln(1/3) is -ln(3), so:\n\n30/(c tau) = (ln(3)) * 20\n\nSo,\n\n30/(c tau) = 20 ln(3)\n\nPlugging this into the equation for ln(2):\n\nln(2) = [20 ln(3)] [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nBecause 1/gamma = 1/20.\n\nSo,\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nln(2) \u2248 0.6931\n\nln(3) \u2248 1.0986\n\nSo,\n\n0.6931 = 1.0986 [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nDivide both sides by 1.0986:\n\n0.6931 / 1.0986 \u2248 (1/20 - 1/gamma')\n\nCompute 0.6931/1.0986 \u2248 0.631.\n\nSo,\n\n0.631 \u2248 (0.05) - (1/gamma')\n\nRearranging:\n\n1/gamma' \u2248 0.05 - 0.631 \u2248 -0.581\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 1/gamma' is negative, which would imply gamma' is negative, which is impossible. I must have made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, let's retrace. The equation after substitution was:\n\nln(2) = [20 ln(3)] [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nWait, let me compute the right-hand side again.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in substitution.\n\nWait, I have:\n\nln(2) = [20 ln(3)] [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me go back.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, the substitution was:\n\n30/(c tau) = 20 ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\nln(2) = (30/(c tau)) [ 1/(gamma) - 1/(gamma') ]\n\nWhich is:\n\nln(2) = [20 ln(3)] [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nSo,\n\nln(2) = 20 ln(3) * [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nCompute 20 ln(3) * (1/20) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\nln(2) = ln(3) - [20 ln(3) * (1/gamma') ]\n\nRearranging,\n\nln(3) - ln(2) = [20 ln(3) ] * (1/gamma' )\n\nSo,\n\nln(3/2) = [20 ln(3) ] * (1/gamma' )\n\nBecause ln(3) - ln(2) = ln(3/2).\n\nSo,\n\n1/gamma' = ln(3/2) / [ 20 ln(3) ]\n\nCompute ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055\n\nSo,\n\n1/gamma' \u2248 0.4055 / (20 * 1.0986 )\n\nCompute denominator: 20 * 1.0986 \u2248 21.972\n\nSo,\n\n1/gamma' \u2248 0.4055 / 21.972 \u2248 approx 0.01845\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' \u2248 1 / 0.01845 \u2248 54.2\n\nSo, approximately 54.2.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option A) 54.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the algebra.\n\nWe had:\n\nln(2) = [20 ln(3)] [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nWhich is:\n\nln(2) = [ ln(3) ) - (20 ln(3) )/(gamma') ]\n\nThen,\n\nln(2) - ln(3) = - (20 ln(3) )/(gamma') \n\nWait, that gives:\n\nln(2/3) = - (20 ln(3) )/(gamma' )\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = - (20 ln(3) ) / ln(2/3)\n\nWait, ln(2/3) is negative, so the negatives cancel.\n\ngamma' = (20 ln(3) ) / |ln(2/3)|\n\nCompute:\n\nln(3) \u2248 1.0986\n\nln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055, so absolute value is 0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = (20 * 1.0986 ) / 0.4055 \u2248 (21.972) / 0.4055 \u2248 approx 54.2.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So the correct gamma is approximately 54.2, which would correspond to option A) 54.\n\nSo, the answer should be A) 54.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.\n\nThe problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.\n\nHmm. So, the main idea here seems to be about the relationship between the particles' speed, their lifetime (due to time dilation), and the distance they travel before decaying. Since they're moving at relativistic speeds, time dilation must be a factor. \n\nI remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). At high velocities, gamma becomes large. Gamma affects time experienced by the moving particles, which would affect how far they travel before decaying.\n\nSo, particles with a higher gamma (higher velocity) will have a longer lifetime from our lab frame perspective. That means they can travel a longer distance before decaying. So, if a particle has a higher gamma, more of them might reach the detector's walls, because they take longer to decay and thus have more time to move further.\n\nWait, but in the problem, initially, at gamma = 20, only one third reach the walls. We need to find the gamma where two-thirds reach the walls. So, that suggests that at the higher gamma, more particles make it, which aligns with my previous thought.\n\nLet me think about the decay process. The proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is tau. From our lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. The distance a particle travels before decaying is v * t, where t is the lab frame lifetime. So, distance = v * gamma * tau.\n\nBut wait, v is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles. So, distance \u2248 c * gamma * tau.\n\nThe detector's radius is 30 meters, so particles that travel 30 meters or more reach the wall. So, for a particle to reach the wall, its decay length must be at least 30 meters. \n\nBut how does this relate to the fraction of particles that reach the wall? I think the fraction depends on the probability that the particle's decay occurs after it has traveled at least 30 meters. \n\nIn particle physics, the decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)). But since the particles are moving at speed v, the time t is distance/(v). So, the probability that a particle hasn't decayed when it's traveled a distance L is exp(-L/(v gamma tau)).\n\nWait, but v is approximately c, so L/(v gamma tau) \u2248 L/(c gamma tau). \n\nThe problem states that when gamma is 20, the average fraction reaching the wall is 1/3. So, 1/3 = exp(-30/(c * 20 * tau)).\n\nWait, let me clarify. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So, the probability P that a particle travels a distance L without decaying is P = exp(-L/(gamma tau c)), since distance L = v t, and t = gamma tau (if tau is the proper lifetime). But since v \u2248 c, L \u2248 c gamma tau t'.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. The average distance a particle travels before decaying is v * gamma * tau. Since v is approximately c, the average decay length is approximately c gamma tau.\n\nSo, for a given gamma, the average decay length is L_avg = c gamma tau.\n\nThe probability that a particle's decay length is greater than or equal to 30 meters is the same as the fraction that reaches the wall. So, that probability P is equal to the fraction reaching the wall.\n\nBut the decay follows an exponential distribution, so P = exp(-30 / L_avg) = exp(-30 / (c gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The decay length is a random variable. The probability that the decay occurs after traveling distance L is P = exp(-L/(c gamma tau)). Because the decay rate is 1/(gamma tau), so the survival probability after time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), and since t = L/c, it becomes exp(-L/(c gamma tau)).\n\nSo, when gamma = 20, the fraction reaching the wall is 1/3. So,\n\n1/3 = exp( -30 / (c * 20 * tau) )\n\nSimilarly, when gamma is higher, say gamma', the fraction becomes 2/3.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait a second, the problem states that when gamma is 20, one third reach the inner walls. So, that means P = 1/3 when gamma =20. We need to find gamma' where P =2/3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem is the opposite. At gamma=20, 1/3 reach the wall. We need to find the gamma where 2/3 reach the wall. So, that would happen when the decay length is longer, so higher gamma.\n\nSo, let's write the equations.\n\nAt gamma=20:\n\n1/3 = exp(-30/(c * 20 * tau)).\n\nWe can take the natural logarithm of both sides.\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 * tau)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n- ln(3) = -30/(20 c tau)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nln(3) = 30/(20 c tau)\n\nSo,\n\nln(3) = (3)/(2 c tau)\n\nSo, 2 c tau = 3 / ln(3)\n\nHmm, maybe we can compute 3/ln(3). Let's compute ln(3) \u2248 1.0986, so 3 / 1.0986 \u2248 2.73.\n\nSo,\n\n2 c tau \u2248 2.73\n\nThus,\n\nc tau \u2248 2.73 / 2 \u2248 1.365\n\nSo, c tau \u2248 1.365 meters.\n\nWait, but that's just a number, but perhaps we don't need to compute the exact value because we can set up a ratio.\n\nNow, for the new gamma', we have:\n\n2/3 = exp( -30/(c gamma' tau) )\n\nTake the natural log of both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(c gamma' tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n- ln(2/3) = 30/(c gamma' tau )\n\nBut ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 - 1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055.

Hmm. Wait, but wait, maybe my approximation is a bit rough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should do this algebraically without plugging in numbers early on.\n\nLet me write the two equations again.\n\nAt gamma = 20:\n\nP1 = 1/3 = exp( -30/(c gamma tau) )\n\nAt gamma' = ?:\n\nP2 = 2/3 = exp( -30/(c gamma' tau) )\n\nTake the ratio of P2 to P1:\n\n(2/3)/(1/3) = [exp( -30/(c gamma' tau) )] / [exp( -30/(c gamma tau) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 = exp( [ -30/(c gamma' tau) + 30/(c gamma tau) ] )\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\nln(2) = [30/(c gamma tau) - 30/(c gamma' tau) ]\n\nFactor out 30/(c tau):\n\nln(2) = (30/(c tau)) [ 1/(gamma) - 1/(gamma') ]\n\nFrom the first equation, when gamma=20:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c*20 tau )\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n30/(c tau) = - ln(1/3) * 20\n\nBut ln(1/3) is -ln(3), so:\n\n30/(c tau) = (ln(3)) * 20\n\nSo,\n\n30/(c tau) = 20 ln(3)\n\nPlugging this into the equation for ln(2):\n\nln(2) = [20 ln(3)] [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nBecause 1/gamma = 1/20.\n\nSo,\n\nln(2) = ln(3) [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nln(2) \u2248 0.6931\n\nln(3) \u2248 1.0986\n\nSo,\n\n0.6931 = 1.0986 [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nDivide both sides by 1.0986:\n\n0.6931 / 1.0986 \u2248 (1/20 - 1/gamma')\n\nCompute 0.6931/1.0986 \u2248 0.631.\n\nSo,\n\n0.631 \u2248 (0.05) - (1/gamma')\n\nRearranging:\n\n1/gamma' \u2248 0.05 - 0.631 \u2248 -0.581\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 1/gamma' is negative, which would imply gamma' is negative, which is impossible. I must have made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, let's retrace. The equation after substitution was:\n\nln(2) = [20 ln(3)] [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nWait, let me compute the right-hand side again.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in substitution.\n\nWait, I have:\n\nln(2) = [20 ln(3)] [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me go back.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, the substitution was:\n\n30/(c tau) = 20 ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\nln(2) = (30/(c tau)) [ 1/(gamma) - 1/(gamma') ]\n\nWhich is:\n\nln(2) = [20 ln(3)] [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nSo,\n\nln(2) = 20 ln(3) * [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nCompute 20 ln(3) * (1/20) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\nln(2) = ln(3) - [20 ln(3) * (1/gamma') ]\n\nRearranging,\n\nln(3) - ln(2) = [20 ln(3) ] * (1/gamma' )\n\nSo,\n\nln(3/2) = [20 ln(3) ] * (1/gamma' )\n\nBecause ln(3) - ln(2) = ln(3/2).\n\nSo,\n\n1/gamma' = ln(3/2) / [ 20 ln(3) ]\n\nCompute ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055\n\nSo,\n\n1/gamma' \u2248 0.4055 / (20 * 1.0986 )\n\nCompute denominator: 20 * 1.0986 \u2248 21.972\n\nSo,\n\n1/gamma' \u2248 0.4055 / 21.972 \u2248 approx 0.01845\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' \u2248 1 / 0.01845 \u2248 54.2\n\nSo, approximately 54.2.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option A) 54.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the algebra.\n\nWe had:\n\nln(2) = [20 ln(3)] [ (1/20) - (1/gamma') ]\n\nWhich is:\n\nln(2) = [ ln(3) ) - (20 ln(3) )/(gamma') ]\n\nThen,\n\nln(2) - ln(3) = - (20 ln(3) )/(gamma') \n\nWait, that gives:\n\nln(2/3) = - (20 ln(3) )/(gamma' )\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = - (20 ln(3) ) / ln(2/3)\n\nWait, ln(2/3) is negative, so the negatives cancel.\n\ngamma' = (20 ln(3) ) / |ln(2/3)|\n\nCompute:\n\nln(3) \u2248 1.0986\n\nln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055, so absolute value is 0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = (20 * 1.0986 ) / 0.4055 \u2248 (21.972) / 0.4055 \u2248 approx 54.2.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So the correct gamma is approximately 54.2, which would correspond to option A) 54.\n\nSo, the answer should be A) 54.\n\n\nTo determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the particles' decay length and their Lorentz factor. The decay length is influenced by the Lorentz factor, which affects the particles' lifetime due to time dilation. The survival probability of a particle traveling a distance \\( L \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\gamma \\tau c}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor, \\( \\tau \\) is the proper lifetime of the particle, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light. For the detector with a radius of 30 meters, the fraction of particles reaching the inner walls corresponds to the probability \\( P \\) that the decay length is at least 30 meters.\n\n### Step 1: Relating the given conditions\nAt \\( \\gamma = 20 \\), one-third of the particles reach the walls, so:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{30}{20 \\tau c}\\right).\n\\]\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{30}{20 \\tau c}.\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n-\\ln(3) = -\\frac{30}{20 \\tau c}.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\ln(3) = \\frac{30}{20 \\tau c}.\n\\]\n\\[\n20 \\tau c = \\frac{30}{\\ln(3)}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solving for the new Lorentz factor\nWe need to find \\( \\gamma' \\) such that two-thirds of the particles reach the walls:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{30}{\\gamma' \\tau c}\\right).\n\\]\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{30}{\\gamma' \\tau c}.\n\\]\n\\[\n-\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{30}{\\gamma' \\tau c}.\n\\]\nUsing \\( \\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\ln(2) - \\ln(3) \\approx 0.6931 - 1.0986 = -0.4055 \\), we have:\n\\[\n0.4055 = \\frac{30}{\\gamma' \\tau c}.\n\\]\n\nFrom Step 1, \\( 20 \\tau c = \\frac{30}{\\ln(3)} \\), so \\( \\tau c = \\frac{30}{20 \\ln(3)} \\). Substituting this into the equation for \\( \\gamma' \\):\n\\[\n0.4055 = \\frac{30}{\\gamma' \\cdot \\frac{30}{20 \\ln(3)}}.\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n0.4055 = \\frac{20 \\ln(3)}{\\gamma'}.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\gamma' = \\frac{20 \\ln(3)}{0.4055}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Numerical calculation\nUsing \\( \\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986 \\):\n\\[\n\\gamma' = \\frac{20 \\cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \\approx \\frac{21.972}{0.4055} \\approx 54.2.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is approximately \\( 54 \\), which corresponds to **Option A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
