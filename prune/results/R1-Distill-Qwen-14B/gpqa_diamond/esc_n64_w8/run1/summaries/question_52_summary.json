      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and see what it's about.\n\nThe question is about a star whose surface temperature changes when spots cover part of it. When 40% of the surface is covered by dark spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find by what factor this ratio changes\u2014specifically, the factor when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.\n\nHmm. So, the star's Teff changes, and that affects the ionization and excitation states of the atoms in the photosphere. Since the photosphere is in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the conditions in the star's atmosphere can be modeled using the Boltzmann equation for the population of energy levels.\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution: (n2/n1) = exp(-\u0394E/(k T)), where \u0394E is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWait, wait. The transition between the levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5. That's in the ultraviolet range, I think. So that's probably a specific spectral line. But maybe the exact wavelength isn't critical for calculating the ratio change here.\n\nThe key here is that when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature drops. But wait, the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So, when spots cover part of the surface, the overall emission is less. But the problem says that the effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Because if the spots are cooler, the average temperature should be lower than 6000 K. So the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when spots are present.\n\nWait, but how does that affect the individual regions? The unspotted regions would be hotter than 6000 K? Or no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Because when spots cover 40% of the surface, the effective temperature (which is an average) is 5500 K. So the rest of the surface must be hotter than 6000 K? Or perhaps the star's photosphere is not isothermal, but the effective temperature is a blackbody average.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when the surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So, the overall emission is lower because of the spots. But the spots are cooler regions. So the unspotted regions might be at a higher temperature than 6000 K, but the average is 5500 K. Or perhaps the Teff is just the average of the entire surface, so the star as a whole is at 5500 K when 40% of its surface is spotted.\n\nWait, but stars are not usually thought of as having different regions with different temperatures. But in reality, starspots are cooler, so the overall effective temperature would be lower. But the problem is giving a scenario where the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is spotted. So perhaps the star's overall photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that would imply that the unspotted regions are at a higher temperature, which might not be the case. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the problem as the star's overall Teff being 5500 K when 40% of the surface is spotted, but the actual photosphere has regions with higher and lower temperatures.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the photosphere's effective temperature decreases when spots are present. So maybe the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. So, the star as a whole is cooler. But that might not make sense because the unspotted regions would be hotter, but perhaps the question is considering the average.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots are cooler regions, so when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the average Teff is 5500 K. So the unspotted regions must be hotter than 6000 K. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star as a blackbody with an effective temperature that's an average of the spotted and unspotted areas. So the overall Teff is a combination of the two areas.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when the surface isn't covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the Teff is calculated as the average of the spotted and unspotted regions.\n\nWait, but in reality, starspots are cooler regions, so the presence of spots lowers the overall effective temperature. But the way it's presented here, the effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered. So perhaps the rest of the surface (60%) is at a higher temperature than 6000 K. But that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, but the unspotted regions are at a higher temperature.\n\nBut maybe the problem is more straightforward. The key point is that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So in that scenario, the photosphere (the entire surface) is at 5500 K. But wait, that doesn't make sense because starspots are cooler regions, so the surrounding photosphere would be hotter. So perhaps the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K, but the unspotted regions are at a higher temperature, and the spotted regions are lower.\n\nBut the question is about the photosphere. So perhaps when 40% of the surface is spotted, the effective temperature of the photosphere (the entire surface) is 5500 K. So the average is 5500 K, but the unspotted regions are at a higher temperature. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is considering that the star's Teff is 5500 K, and the unspotted regions are at a higher temperature. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when 40% is covered, but that seems counterintuitive. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it from another angle.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. I need to find the factor by which the ratio changes. So I'm looking for (Ratio without spots) / (Ratio with spots) = factor.\n\nThe ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )\n\nSince E2 > E1 (because the transition is from a lower to higher energy, or vice versa?), wait, the transition corresponds to a specific wavelength. Let me think: the energy difference \u0394E = h c / \u03bb, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nWait, but the transition from level 1 to level 2 (or vice versa) corresponds to 1448 \u00c5. Let me compute \u0394E. But maybe I don't need the exact value because it might cancel out.\n\nWait, the ratio is n2/n1 = exp( (E1 - E2) / (k T) ) because E2 > E1, so E1 - E2 is negative. So the ratio would decrease as temperature decreases because the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The Boltzmann factor is (n2)/(n1) = exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )\n\nIf E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive, so the exponent is negative. So as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases. So higher T makes the ratio higher.\n\nIn the problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). So the ratio n2/n1 should be lower when T is lower. Which matches the observation in the problem: the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the ratio without spots (T=6000 K) is higher than when spots are present (T=5500 K).\n\nSo the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.\n\nSo factor = [exp( - (E2-E1)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k * 5500) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to exp( (E2-E1) [ 1/(5500 k) - 1/(6000 k) ] )\n\nWait, let me compute the exponent:\n\nLet me factor out (E2 - E1)/(k). So,\n\nExponent = (E2 - E1)/(k) * [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ]\n\nWhich is (\u0394E/k) * [ (6000 -5500) / (5500 *6000) ) ]\n\nCompute the denominator: 5500 *6000 = 33,000,000.\n\nThe numerator: 6000-5500=500.\n\nSo the term becomes (\u0394E/k) * (500 / 33,000,000) = (\u0394E/k) * (1/66,000 )\n\nWait, 500 /33e6 is 5e2 / 3.3e7 = approx 1.515e-5.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, 500/(5500 *6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 5/(330,000) = 1/(66,000) \u2248 1.515e-5.\n\nSo the exponent is (\u0394E/k) * 1.515e-5.\n\nBut what's \u0394E? Since \u0394E = h c / \u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J s.\n\nc is speed of light: 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u03bb is 1448 \u00c5. 1 \u00c5 is 1e-10 meters, so \u03bb = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo \u0394E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) \n\nCalculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.\n\nDivide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nSo \u0394E \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nNow, k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.\n\nSo (\u0394E)/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) \u2248 (1.373 /1.38) * 1e5 \u2248 approx 0.995 * 1e5 \u2248 99,500 K.\n\nSo (\u0394E/k) \u2248 1e5 K.\n\nWait, more accurately: 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 /1.38) * (1e5) \u2248 (0.995) * 1e5 = 99,500 K.\n\nSo the exponent becomes 99,500 K * 1.515e-5 = let's compute that.\n\n99,500 * 1.515e-5 = (99,500) * (1.515e-5) \n\nLet me compute 99,500 * 1.515e-5.\n\n99,500 = 9.95e4.\n\nSo 9.95e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.95 * 1.515 * 1e-1.\n\n9.95 * 1.515 \u2248 15.07425.\n\nMultiply by 0.1: 1.507425.\n\nSo exponent is approximately 1.507.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.507) \u2248 e^1.507.\n\nWhat's e^1.5? e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817.\n\ne^1.507 is a bit higher. Let's compute 1.507:\n\ne^1.5 = 4.4817\n\ne^0.007: since 0.007 is small, we can approximate e^x \u2248 1 + x + x\u00b2/2. So e^0.007 \u2248 1.007 + (0.007)^2 /2 \u2248 1.00700049 \u2248 1.007.\n\nSo e^1.507 \u2248 e^1.5 * e^0.007 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.007 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.007.\n\nCompute that:\n\n4.4817 * 1 =4.4817\n\n4.4817 * 0.007= ~0.03137\n\nTotal \u22484.513.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.51.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5, so that's the answer.\n",

Since \u0394E = h c / \u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J s.\n\nc is speed of light: 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u03bb is 1448 \u00c5. 1 \u00c5 is 1e-10 meters, so \u03bb = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo \u0394E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) \n\nCalculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.\n\nDivide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nSo \u0394E \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nNow, k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.\n\nSo (\u0394E)/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) \u2248 (1.373 /1.38) * 1e5 \u2248 approx 0.995 * 1e5 \u2248 99,500 K.\n\nSo (\u0394E/k) \u2248 1e5 K.\n\nWait, more accurately: 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 /1.38) * (1e5) \u2248 (0.995) * 1e5 = 99,500 K.\n\nSo the exponent becomes 99,500 K * 1.515e-5 = let's compute that.\n\n99,500 * 1.515e-5 = (99,500) * (1.515e-5) \n\nLet me compute 99,500 * 1.515e-5.\n\n99,500 = 9.95e4.\n\nSo 9.95e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.95 * 1.515 * 1e-1.\n\n9.95 * 1.515 \u2248 15.07425.\n\nMultiply by 0.1: 1.507425.\n\nSo exponent is approximately 1.507.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.507) \u2248 e^1.507.\n\nWhat's e^1.5? e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817.\n\ne^1.507 is a bit higher. Let's compute 1.507:\n\ne^1.5 = 4.4817\n\ne^0.007: since 0.007 is small, we can approximate e^x \u2248 1 + x + x\u00b2/2. So e^0.007 \u2248 1.007 + (0.007)^2 /2 \u2248 1.00700049 \u2248 1.007.\n\nSo e^1.507 \u2248 e^1.5 * e^0.007 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.007 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.007.\n\nCompute that:\n\n4.4817 * 1 =4.4817\n\n4.4817 * 0.007= ~0.03137\n\nTotal \u22484.513.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.51.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5, so that's the answer.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \\( T = 6000 \\, \\text{K} \\)) to having spots (effective temperature \\( T = 5500 \\, \\text{K} \\)).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of stellar atmospheres and stuff. Let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels in a star's photosphere. The star's effective temperature changes when spots cover part of its surface. Without spots, Teff is 6000 K, and when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. We need to find out how the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels changes between these two scenarios.\n\nHmm, I remember that the ratio of populations in different energy levels in a star's atmosphere is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. Oh right, that's in the ultraviolet range. But wait, Ti lines are typically in the optical for neutral Ti. Maybe this is a specific transition. Anyway, the exact wavelength might relate to the energy difference between the levels.\n\nSo the energy difference \u0394E can be calculated using the relation E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and \u03bb is wavelength. Let me note that down.\n\nBut wait, since the ratio depends on the exponential of (-\u0394E)/(kT), maybe we can express this ratio in terms of the temperatures. Let me think about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.\n\nWait, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. So without spots, T is 6000 K, and with spots, T drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2. Let's denote the ratio as R = N2/N1. Wait, no, the ratio observed is N1/N2? Wait the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, R is lower. So we're looking at R = (N_level1)/(N_level2). And when the temperature decreases, this ratio decreases. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Boltzmann factor: N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). So if E2 > E1, then higher energy level 2 is less populated than level 1. So when the temperature decreases, the exponential term gets smaller, meaning N2/N1 decreases. So if the ratio of N2/N1 goes down, that would mean the ratio of N1/N2 goes up. But the problem states that the observed ratio decreases. So wait, the observed ratio is which one?\n\nThe problem says the ratio of the number of Ti in level 1 and level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So observed ratio R = N1/N2. Without spots, R is higher, and with spots, it's lower. So that makes sense because when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, so exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)) is smaller. So N2/N1 is smaller, meaning N1/N2 is larger. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify:\n\nIf R = N1/N2, then without spots, R is higher. Because when T is higher (6000 K), the exponent -(\u0394E)/(kT) is less negative, so the exponential is larger. So N2/N1 is larger, which makes R = N1/N2 smaller? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let's suppose E2 > E1, so \u0394E = E2 - E1 is positive. Then:\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-\u0394E/(k T)).\n\nAt higher T, the exponential is larger because the denominator is bigger, making the exponent less negative. So higher T means more N2/N1. So R = N1/N2 would be lower.\n\nWait, but the problem says when the star has spots (lower T), the observed ratio R decreases. So R is N1/N2. So when T is lower, R is lower. Because N2/N1 is higher when T is higher, so N1/N2 is lower. Wait, that's conflicting with the problem statement. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I have the ratio inverted. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio is lower than when it doesn't (T=6000 K). So if without spots, the ratio is R1, with spots it's R2, and R1 > R2.\n\nWait, let me think about R as N1/N2. When T increases, the exponential term increases because denominator is bigger, so exp(-\u0394E/(kT)) is larger. So N2/N1 increases, meaning N1/N2 decreases. So R = N1/N2 would be lower when T is higher.\n\nWait, that's not matching the problem. Let me make it concrete. Let's say when T increases from 5500 to 6000 K, R (N1/N2) should decrease because N2/N1 increases.\n\nBut the problem says when the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio is lower. So when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K), the ratio is higher. So R(T=6000) > R(T=5500). So if R is N1/N2, then that's the case. Because at higher T, N2 increases relative to N1, so N1/N2 decreases. Wait, that's conflicting because when T is higher, the ratio R would be lower. So when T is higher (no spots), R is lower. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which would mean R is lower when T is lower, which can't be if R is N1/N2.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's say the ratio in question is (N_level1)/(N_level2). Without spots, this ratio is higher. With spots, lower. So when T is higher, the ratio is higher. So that would imply that when T increases, (N1/N2) increases. Which can't be right because, according to Boltzmann, higher T would cause more population in higher energy levels. So N2 would be higher than N1, so N1/N2 would be lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the ratio the other way around. Maybe the ratio is (N_level2)/(N_level1). Let me see. Without spots, T is higher, so N2/N1 is higher. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so N2/N1 is lower. So the ratio (N2/N1) would be lower when the star has spots. But the problem says the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if the observed ratio is (N2/N1), then when the star has spots, the ratio is lower, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So if the ratio is N2/N1, then when T decreases, this ratio decreases. Because the exponential term becomes smaller. So yes, that would make sense. So the ratio is N2/N1.\n\nWait, but the problem states: \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.\" So the observed ratio is N1/N2 or N2/N1? The wording says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio is N1/N2, then a lower temperature would make N1/N2 higher. Because when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, so N2/N1 is smaller, so N1/N2 is larger. But the problem says the ratio decreases, which would imply that when the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio is lower. So if the ratio is N2/N1, then when T is lower, N2/N1 is lower, which aligns with the problem. So the ratio in question is N2/N1.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me rephrase.\n\nScenario 1: No spots. T = 6000 K. Ratio R1 = N2/N1.\n\nScenario 2: Spots. T =5500 K. Ratio R2 = N2/N1.\n\nProblem states R decreases, so R1 > R2.\n\nBecause when T is higher, the exponential term is larger, so R = N2/N1 is higher. So yes, R1/R2 is greater than 1.\n\nThe question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So factor = R1 / R2.\n\nBecause R1 is higher than R2, the factor is greater than 1.\n\nSo now, how to calculate R1/R2.\n\nR = (g2/g1) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = [ (g2/g1) exp(-\u0394E/(k T1)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-\u0394E/(k T2)) ] = exp( [\u0394E/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\n\u0394E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nBut wait, since we have the same transition, \u0394E is the same for both cases.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nLet me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1.\n\nWait, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nSo 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(5500 *6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 5/(330,000) \u2248 0.0000151515.\n\nSo the exponent is (\u0394E/k) * (0.0000151515).\n\nNow, \u0394E is hc/\u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo \u0394E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) \u2248 1.372e-18 J.\n\nBut wait, I might have miscalculated that. Let me compute it again.\n\nWait, 1448 \u00c5 = 1448 * 1e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo \u0394E = (6.626e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s) ) / (1.448e-7 m) \n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.\n\nDivide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nNow, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K.\n\nSo \u0394E/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) \u2248 9.955e4 \u2248 99550 K.\n\nWait, that's a big number. So (\u0394E)/(k) \u2248 99550 K.\n\nSo the exponent becomes (99550 K) * (1.51515e-5) \u2248 99550 * 1.51515e-5 \u2248 99550 * 0.0000151515.\n\nLet me compute that: 99550 * 0.0000151515.\n\nHmm, 100,000 * 0.000015 is 1.5. So 99550 is 99.55% of 100,000.\n\nSo 0.0000151515 * 100000 = 1.51515.\n\nSo 0.9955 * 1.51515 \u2248 approximately 1.507.\n\nSo the exponent is about 1.507.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp(1.507) \u2248 e^1.507.\n\nWhat's e^1.5? e^1 is ~2.718, e^0.5 is ~1.648. So e^1.5 \u2248 4.48. And e^1.507 would be a bit higher, maybe around 4.53 or so.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which seems close.\n\nWait, but let me be more precise. Let me compute 1.507:\n\ne^1.507 = e^(1 + 0.507) = e * e^0.507.\n\ne is about 2.71828.\n\ne^0.5 is about 1.64872, e^0.507 is slightly higher. Let's compute 0.507:\n\nUsing the Taylor series or calculator approach, but maybe I'll approximate. 0.507 is 0.5 + 0.007.\n\nWe can use e^x \u2248 1 + x + x\u00b2/2 for small x. But x is 0.007, so:\n\ne^0.007 \u2248 1 + 0.007 + (0.007)^2 / 2 \u2248 1.007 + 0.0000245 \u2248 1.0070245.\n\nSo e^0.507 \u2248 e^0.5 * e^0.007 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.0070245 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.007 \u2248 1.64872 + (1.64872 * 0.007) = 1.64872 + 0.01154 \u2248 1.66026.\n\nSo e^1.507 \u2248 e * 1.66026 \u2248 2.71828 * 1.66026 \u2248 Let's compute that:\n\n2.718 * 1.660 = \n\n2 * 1.660 = 3.32\n\n0.7 * 1.660 = 1.162\n\n0.018 *1.660 \u2248 0.030.\n\nAdding up: 3.32 +1.162=4.482 + 0.03=4.512.\n\nSo e^1.507 \u2248 4.512.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of stellar atmospheres and stuff. Let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels in a star's photosphere. The star's effective temperature changes when spots cover part of its surface. Without spots, Teff is 6000 K, and when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. We need to find out how the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels changes between these two scenarios.\n\nHmm, I remember that the ratio of populations in different energy levels in a star's atmosphere is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. Oh right, that's in the ultraviolet range. But wait, Ti lines are typically in the optical for neutral Ti. Maybe this is a specific transition. Anyway, the exact wavelength might relate to the energy difference between the levels.\n\nSo the energy difference \u0394E can be calculated using the relation E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and \u03bb is wavelength. Let me note that down.\n\nBut wait, since the ratio depends on the exponential of (-\u0394E)/(kT), maybe we can express this ratio in terms of the temperatures. Let me think about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.\n\nWait, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. So without spots, T is 6000 K, and with spots, T drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2. Let's denote the ratio as R = N2/N1. Wait, no, the ratio observed is N1/N2? Wait the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, R is lower. So we're looking at R = (N_level1)/(N_level2). And when the temperature decreases, this ratio decreases. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Boltzmann factor: N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). So if E2 > E1, then higher energy level 2 is less populated than level 1. So when the temperature decreases, the exponential term gets smaller, meaning N2/N1 decreases. So if the ratio of N2/N1 goes down, that would mean the ratio of N1/N2 goes up. But the problem states that the observed ratio decreases. So wait, the observed ratio is which one?\n\nThe problem says the ratio of the number of Ti in level 1 and level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So observed ratio R = N1/N2. Without spots, R is higher, and with spots, it's lower. So that makes sense because when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, so exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)) is smaller. So N2/N1 is smaller, meaning N1/N2 is larger. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify:\n\nIf R = N1/N2, then without spots, R is higher. Because when T is higher (6000 K), the exponent -(\u0394E)/(kT) is less negative, so the exponential is larger. So N2/N1 is larger, which makes R = N1/N2 smaller? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let's suppose E2 > E1, so \u0394E = E2 - E1 is positive. Then:\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-\u0394E/(k T)).\n\nAt higher T, the exponential is larger because the denominator is bigger, making the exponent less negative. So higher T means more N2/N1. So R = N1/N2 would be lower.\n\nWait, but the problem says when the star has spots (lower T), the observed ratio R decreases. So R is N1/N2. So when T is lower, R is lower. Because N2/N1 is higher when T is higher, so N1/N2 is lower. Wait, that's conflicting with the problem statement. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I have the ratio inverted. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio is lower than when it doesn't (T=6000 K). So if without spots, the ratio is R1, with spots it's R2, and R1 > R2.\n\nWait, let me think about R as N1/N2. When T increases, the exponential term increases because denominator is bigger, so exp(-\u0394E/(kT)) is larger. So N2/N1 increases, meaning N1/N2 decreases. So R = N1/N2 would be lower when T is higher.\n\nWait, that's not matching the problem. Let me make it concrete. Let's say when T increases from 5500 to 6000 K, R (N1/N2) should decrease because N2/N1 increases.\n\nBut the problem says when the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio is lower. So when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K), the ratio is higher. So R(T=6000) > R(T=5500). So if R is N1/N2, then that's the case. Because at higher T, N2 increases relative to N1, so N1/N2 decreases. Wait, that's conflicting because when T is higher, the ratio R would be lower. So when T is higher (no spots), R is lower. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which would mean R is lower when T is lower, which can't be if R is N1/N2.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's say the ratio in question is (N_level1)/(N_level2). Without spots, this ratio is higher. With spots, lower. So when T is higher, the ratio is higher. So that would imply that when T increases, (N1/N2) increases. Which can't be right because, according to Boltzmann, higher T would cause more population in higher energy levels. So N2 would be higher than N1, so N1/N2 would be lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the ratio the other way around. Maybe the ratio is (N_level2)/(N_level1). Let me see. Without spots, T is higher, so N2/N1 is higher. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so N2/N1 is lower. So the ratio (N2/N1) would be lower when the star has spots. But the problem says the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if the observed ratio is (N2/N1), then when the star has spots, the ratio is lower, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So if the ratio is N2/N1, then when T decreases, this ratio decreases. Because the exponential term becomes smaller. So yes, that would make sense. So the ratio is N2/N1.\n\nWait, but the problem states: \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.\" So the observed ratio is N1/N2 or N2/N1? The wording says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio is N1/N2, then a lower temperature would make N1/N2 higher. Because when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, so N2/N1 is smaller, so N1/N2 is larger. But the problem says the ratio decreases, which would imply that when the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio is lower. So if the ratio is N2/N1, then when T is lower, N2/N1 is lower, which aligns with the problem. So the ratio in question is N2/N1.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me rephrase.\n\nScenario 1: No spots. T = 6000 K. Ratio R1 = N2/N1.\n\nScenario 2: Spots. T =5500 K. Ratio R2 = N2/N1.\n\nProblem states R decreases, so R1 > R2.\n\nBecause when T is higher, the exponential term is larger, so R = N2/N1 is higher. So yes, R1/R2 is greater than 1.\n\nThe question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So factor = R1 / R2.\n\nBecause R1 is higher than R2, the factor is greater than 1.\n\nSo now, how to calculate R1/R2.\n\nR = (g2/g1) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = [ (g2/g1) exp(-\u0394E/(k T1)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-\u0394E/(k T2)) ] = exp( [\u0394E/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\n\u0394E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nBut wait, since we have the same transition, \u0394E is the same for both cases.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nLet me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1.\n\nWait, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nSo 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(5500 *6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 5/(330,000) \u2248 0.0000151515.\n\nSo the exponent is (\u0394E/k) * (0.0000151515).\n\nNow, \u0394E is hc/\u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo \u0394E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) \u2248 1.372e-18 J.\n\nBut wait, I might have miscalculated that. Let me compute it again.\n\nWait, 1448 \u00c5 = 1448 * 1e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo \u0394E = (6.626e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s) ) / (1.448e-7 m) \n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.\n\nDivide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nNow, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K.\n\nSo \u0394E/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) \u2248 9.955e4 \u2248 99550 K.\n\nWait, that's a big number. So (\u0394E)/(k) \u2248 99550 K.\n\nSo the exponent becomes (99550 K) * (1.51515e-5) \u2248 99550 * 1.51515e-5 \u2248 99550 * 0.0000151515.\n\nLet me compute that: 99550 * 0.0000151515.\n\nHmm, 100,000 * 0.000015 is 1.5. So 99550 is 99.55% of 100,000.\n\nSo 0.0000151515 * 100000 = 1.51515.\n\nSo 0.9955 * 1.51515 \u2248 approximately 1.507.\n\nSo the exponent is about 1.507.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp(1.507) \u2248 e^1.507.\n\nWhat's e^1.5? e^1 is ~2.718, e^0.5 is ~1.648. So e^1.5 \u2248 4.48. And e^1.507 would be a bit higher, maybe around 4.53 or so.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which seems close.\n\nWait, but let me be more precise. Let me compute 1.507:\n\ne^1.507 = e^(1 + 0.507) = e * e^0.507.\n\ne is about 2.71828.\n\ne^0.5 is about 1.64872, e^0.507 is slightly higher. Let's compute 0.507:\n\nUsing the Taylor series or calculator approach, but maybe I'll approximate. 0.507 is 0.5 + 0.007.\n\nWe can use e^x \u2248 1 + x + x\u00b2/2 for small x. But x is 0.007, so:\n\ne^0.007 \u2248 1 + 0.007 + (0.007)^2 / 2 \u2248 1.007 + 0.0000245 \u2248 1.0070245.\n\nSo e^0.507 \u2248 e^0.5 * e^0.007 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.0070245 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.007 \u2248 1.64872 + (1.64872 * 0.007) = 1.64872 + 0.01154 \u2248 1.66026.\n\nSo e^1.507 \u2248 e * 1.66026 \u2248 2.71828 * 1.66026 \u2248 Let's compute that:\n\n2.718 * 1.660 = \n\n2 * 1.660 = 3.32\n\n0.7 * 1.660 = 1.162\n\n0.018 *1.660 \u2248 0.030.\n\nAdding up: 3.32 +1.162=4.482 + 0.03=4.512.\n\nSo e^1.507 \u2248 4.512. So the ratio R1/R2 is approximately 4.51.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is the closest.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \\(\\Delta E = h c / \\lambda\\) is the energy difference between the levels, \\(k\\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nSo, the problem is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when it does have spots.\n\nHmm, okay. So the key points are:\n\n1. The star's Teff changes when spots are present.\n2. The ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) is being observed.\n3. When the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when there are no spots, the ratio is higher.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify: when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So without spots, Teff is 6000 K; with spots, 5500 K.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is n1/n2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when Teff is lower (with spots), n1/n2 is lower. So, without spots, n1/n2 is higher.\n\nIn LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5. So that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe extreme UV? I'm not sure, but the exact wavelength might relate to the energy difference between the levels.\n\nWait, the energy of a photon is E = hc/\u03bb. So E2 - E1 = hc/\u03bb. Let me compute that. H is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. Let me think about the numbers.\n\nBut wait, since we're dealing with the ratio, perhaps I can express the ratio in terms of temperatures.\n\nLet me denote the two temperatures as T1 = 6000 K (no spots) and T2 = 5500 K (with spots).\n\nThe ratio without spots is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ), and with spots, it's R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ).\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R1 (without spots) is larger than R2 (with spots). So the factor is R1/R2.\n\nSo, R1/R2 = exp( [\u0394E/(k T1) - \u0394E/(k T2) ] ) = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nBut wait, \u0394E = hc/\u03bb. So substituting that:\n\nR1/R2 = exp( (hc/(\u03bb k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nHmm, okay. Let me compute this.\n\nGiven \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6ms. 1 \u00c5 is 1e-10 meters. So \u03bb = 1448e-10 m.\n\nh = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = speed of light = 3e8 m/s\n\nk = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nSo, let's compute (h c)/(\u03bb k):\n\nh c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDivide by \u03bb k: (1.9878e-25) / (1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K )\n\nWait, let me compute denominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K.\n\n1448e-10 is 1.448e-7 m.\n\n1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 2.003e-30 J\u00b7m/K.\n\nSo h c/(\u03bb k) = (1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (2.003e-30 J\u00b7m/K) ) \u2248 (1.9878 / 2.003 )e5 K \u2248 approximately 1e5 K? Wait, wait, let's compute it exactly.\n\n1.9878e-25 / 2.003e-30 = (1.9878 / 2.003) * 1e5 \u2248 (approx 0.992) * 1e5 \u2248 99,200 K.\n\nSo approximately 9.92e4 K.\n\nSo (h c)/(\u03bb k) \u2248 9.92e4 K.\n\nNow, compute (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) K^-1.\n\nCompute 1/6000 = 0.000166666..., 1/5500\u22480.000181818.\n\nSo 0.000166666 - 0.000181818 \u2248 -0.000015152.\n\nWait, wait, wait, no. Because when T decreases, 1/T increases. So 5500 is lower than 6000, so 1/5500 is higher than 1/6000. So 1/6000 is 0.000166666..., 1/5500 is 0.000181818. So the difference is 0.000166666 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015152.\n\nSo (1/T1 -1/T2) = -0.000015152 K^-1.\n\nMultiply by (h c)/(\u03bb k) \u22489.92e4 K:\n\nSo (9.92e4 K) * (-0.000015152 K^-1) = 9.92e4 * (-1.5152e-5) = approximately -1.505.\n\nSo the exponent is -1.505.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp(-1.505) \u2248 e^-1.505. Let's compute that. e^-1 is about 0.3679, e^-1.5 is about 0.2231, e^-1.505 is a bit less than that.\n\nAlternatively, exact calculation:\n\n1.505: e^-1.5 is 0.22313, e^-0.005 is about 0.99501. So e^-1.505 \u2248 0.22313 * 0.99501 \u2248 0.222.\n\nWait, but wait: our exponent is (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )= (h c/(\u03bb k)) (1/T1 -1/T2) ), which is negative. So R1/R2 = exp( negative number ), which is less than 1. But wait, the ratio R1 is without spots, which is higher than R2. So R1/R2 is greater than 1.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the ratio R is n1/n2. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), since E2 > E1, because the transition is from level 1 to level 2, so E2 is higher. So E2 - E1 is positive.\n\nSo when T increases, the exponential becomes smaller. So for higher T, the ratio n1/n2 decreases.\n\nWait, because as T increases, the denominator increases, so the exponent becomes more negative, making the exponential smaller.\n\nWait, but wait, let's see: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo if T increases, the exponential term decreases. So n1/n2 decreases when T increases.\n\nSo when the star has spots, the Teff is lower. So T2 =5500 K is lower than T1=6000 K. So without spots, the T is higher, so the exponential term is smaller, making n1/n2 lower. Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Wait, that's conflicting with my current understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me double-check.\n\nThe observed ratio R = n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower (with spots), R is lower. So when T is lower, R is smaller.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T makes the exponential term smaller. So if T decreases, the exponential term is larger.\n\nWait, let's think: if T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases. So exp( -x ) decreases as x increases. So if T increases, the exponential term decreases.\n\nSo n1/n2 is proportional to exp(-x). So when T increases, n1/n2 decreases.\n\nBut in the problem, when T decreases (spots present), the ratio R (n1/n2) decreases. That contradicts. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the levels wrong. The transition is from level 1 to level 2. So the photon emitted corresponds to E2 - E1. So in the Boltzmann equation, n2 is higher than n1 if E2 > E1, because the higher energy level is less populated.\n\nWait, but in the ratio n1/n2, if E2 > E1, then higher T would make n1/n2 smaller because n2 is more populated.\n\nSo without spots, T is higher (6000 K) \u2192 n1/n2 is lower. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower. But according to our previous analysis, higher T leads to lower n1/n2. So if T is lower, n1/n2 would be higher. So that would mean that without spots (T higher), n1/n2 is lower, and with spots (T lower), n1/n2 is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases, which suggests that the ratio is lower when T is lower. So this is a contradiction.\n\nHmm, perhaps I have the levels inverted. Maybe the transition is from level 2 to level 1, meaning E1 > E2. So if E1 is higher than E2, then the Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ) \u2192 which becomes exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ), which is exp( positive value ). So when T increases, the exponent increases, so the ratio n1/n2 increases.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if E1 is higher than E2, then E2 - E1 is negative. So -(E2 - E1) is positive. So the Boltzmann factor becomes exp( positive value ), which increases with T.\n\nSo when T increases, n1/n2 increases.\n\nIn the problem, when the star has spots, T is lower. So n1/n2 would be lower when T is lower, which aligns with the problem statement.\n\nSo in that case, when T is higher (no spots), n1/n2 is higher. So the ratio R1 (no spots) is higher than R2 (with spots).\n\nSo the factor is R1/R2 = exp( [ (E1 - E2)/(k) ] (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, no, let's re-express it.\n\nWait, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nIf E2 < E1, then E2-E1 is negative. So -(E2-E1) is positive.\n\nSo n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T increases, (E1 - E2)/(k T) decreases, so exp() decreases. So n1/n2 decreases. Hmm, this doesn't make sense with the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.\n\nThe ratio n1/n2 depends on the temperature. The question is, when the temperature decreases, does the ratio increase or decrease?\n\nIf E2 > E1, then the Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T decreases, the denominator is smaller, so the exponent is larger. So exp(-x) becomes smaller as x increases. So when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp( -x ) decreases. So n1/n2 decreases.\n\nWhich aligns with the problem statement: when T decreases (with spots), n1/n2 decreases.\n\nSo in this case, E2 > E1. So when T is higher (no spots), (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so exp(-x) is larger. So n1/n2 is larger.\n\nSo the factor R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, let me recompute the exponent correctly.\n\nWe have R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) )\n\nR2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) + (E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\nFactor out (E2-E1)/(k):\n\n= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBecause 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1 since T2 < T1.\n\nSo (1/T2 -1/T1) is positive, so the exponent is positive.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBut E2-E1 is equal to hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo let's compute this.\n\nWe have:\n\n(E2-E1)/(k) = hc/(\u03bb k)\n\nSo, (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = (hc/(\u03bb k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )\n\nEarlier, I computed (hc/(\u03bb k)) as approximately 9.92e4 K.\n\nNow, (1/T2 -1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1.\n\nCompute that:\n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818\n\n1/6000 \u2248 0.000166667\n\nDifference is 0.000015151 K^-1.\n\nSo 9.92e4 K * 0.000015151 K^-1 = 9.92e4 * 1.5151e-5 \u2248 approx 1.505.\n\nSo the exponent is 1.505.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp(1.505) \u2248 e^1.505 \u2248 ?\n\nWe know that e^1 = 2.718, e^1.5 \u2248 4.4817, e^1.505 is a bit more than that.\n\nCompute e^1.505:\n\nWe can use the Taylor expansion around 1.5.\n\nLet me think, e^1.5 is 4.4816890703.\n\nNow, e^1.505 = e^(1.5 + 0.005) = e^1.5 * e^0.005.\n\ne^0.005 is approximately 1 + 0.005 + (0.005)^2/2 + ... \u2248 1.0050125.\n\nSo e^1.505 \u2248 4.481689 * 1.0050125 \u2248 4.481689 * 1.005 \u2248 4.481689 + (4.481689 * 0.005) = 4.481689 + 0.022408 \u2248 4.504.\n\nSo approximately 4.5.\n\nSo R1/R2 \u2248 4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor is approximately 4.5.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nSo, the problem is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when it does have spots.\n\nHmm, okay. So the key points are:\n\n1. The star's Teff changes when spots are present.\n2. The ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) is being observed.\n3. When the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when there are no spots, the ratio is higher.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify: when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So without spots, Teff is 6000 K; with spots, 5500 K.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is n1/n2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when Teff is lower (with spots), n1/n2 is lower. So, without spots, n1/n2 is higher.\n\nIn LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5. So that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe extreme UV? I'm not sure, but the exact wavelength might relate to the energy difference between the levels.\n\nWait, the energy of a photon is E = hc/\u03bb. So E2 - E1 = hc/\u03bb. Let me compute that. H is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. Let me think about the numbers.\n\nBut wait, since we're dealing with the ratio, perhaps I can express the ratio in terms of temperatures.\n\nLet me denote the two temperatures as T1 = 6000 K (no spots) and T2 = 5500 K (with spots).\n\nThe ratio without spots is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ), and with spots, it's R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ).\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R1 (without spots) is larger than R2 (with spots). So the factor is R1/R2.\n\nSo, R1/R2 = exp( [\u0394E/(k T1) - \u0394E/(k T2) ] ) = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nBut wait, \u0394E = hc/\u03bb. So substituting that:\n\nR1/R2 = exp( (hc/(\u03bb k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nHmm, okay. Let me compute this.\n\nGiven \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6ms. 1 \u00c5 is 1e-10 meters. So \u03bb = 1448e-10 m.\n\nh = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = speed of light = 3e8 m/s\n\nk = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nSo, let's compute (h c)/(\u03bb k):\n\nh c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDivide by \u03bb k: (1.9878e-25) / (1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K )\n\nWait, let me compute denominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K.\n\n1448e-10 is 1.448e-7 m.\n\n1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 2.003e-30 J\u00b7m/K.\n\nSo h c/(\u03bb k) = (1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (2.003e-30 J\u00b7m/K) ) \u2248 (1.9878 / 2.003 )e5 K \u2248 approximately 1e5 K? Wait, wait, let's compute it exactly.\n\n1.9878e-25 / 2.003e-30 = (1.9878 / 2.003) * 1e5 \u2248 (approx 0.992) * 1e5 \u2248 99,200 K.\n\nSo approximately 9.92e4 K.\n\nSo (h c)/(\u03bb k) \u2248 9.92e4 K.\n\nNow, compute (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) K^-1.\n\nCompute 1/6000 = 0.000166666..., 1/5500\u22480.000181818.\n\nSo 0.000166666 - 0.000181818 \u2248 -0.000015152.\n\nWait, wait, wait, no. Because when T decreases, 1/T increases. So 5500 is lower than 6000, so 1/5500 is higher than 1/6000. So 1/6000 is 0.000166666..., 1/5500 is 0.000181818. So the difference is 0.000166666 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015152.\n\nSo (1/T1 -1/T2) = -0.000015152 K^-1.\n\nMultiply by (h c)/(\u03bb k) \u22489.92e4 K:\n\nSo (9.92e4 K) * (-0.000015152 K^-1) = 9.92e4 * (-1.5152e-5) = approximately -1.505.\n\nSo the exponent is -1.505.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp(-1.505) \u2248 e^-1.505. Let's compute that. e^-1 is about 0.3679, e^-1.5 is about 0.2231, e^-1.505 is a bit less than that.\n\nAlternatively, exact calculation:\n\n1.505: e^-1.5 is 0.22313, e^-0.005 is about 0.99501. So e^-1.505 \u2248 0.22313 * 0.99501 \u2248 0.222.\n\nWait, but wait: our exponent is (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )= (h c/(\u03bb k)) (1/T1 -1/T2) ), which is negative. So R1/R2 = exp( negative number ), which is less than 1. But wait, the ratio R1 is without spots, which is higher than R2. So R1/R2 is greater than 1.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the ratio R is n1/n2. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), since E2 > E1, because the transition is from level 1 to level 2, so E2 is higher. So E2 - E1 is positive.\n\nSo when T increases, the exponential becomes smaller. So for higher T, the ratio n1/n2 decreases.\n\nWait, because as T increases, the denominator increases, so the exponent becomes more negative, making the exponential smaller.\n\nWait, but wait, let's see: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo if T increases, the exponential term decreases. So n1/n2 decreases when T increases.\n\nSo when the star has spots, the Teff is lower. So T2 =5500 K is lower than T1=6000 K. So without spots, the T is higher, so the exponential term is smaller, making n1/n2 lower. Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Wait, that's conflicting with my current understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me double-check.\n\nThe observed ratio R = n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower (with spots), R is lower. So when T is lower, R is smaller.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T makes the exponential term smaller. So if T decreases, the exponential term is larger.\n\nWait, let's think: if T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases. So exp( -x ) decreases as x increases. So if T increases, the exponential term decreases.\n\nSo n1/n2 is proportional to exp(-x). So when T increases, n1/n2 decreases.\n\nBut in the problem, when T decreases (spots present), the ratio R (n1/n2) decreases. That contradicts. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the levels wrong. The transition is from level 1 to level 2. So the photon emitted corresponds to E2 - E1. So in the Boltzmann equation, n2 is higher than n1 if E2 > E1, because the higher energy level is less populated.\n\nWait, but in the ratio n1/n2, if E2 > E1, then higher T would make n1/n2 smaller because n2 is more populated.\n\nSo without spots, T is higher (6000 K) \u2192 n1/n2 is lower. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower. But according to our previous analysis, higher T leads to lower n1/n2. So if T is lower, n1/n2 would be higher. So that would mean that without spots (T higher), n1/n2 is lower, and with spots (T lower), n1/n2 is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases, which suggests that the ratio is lower when T is lower. So this is a contradiction.\n\nHmm, perhaps I have the levels inverted. Maybe the transition is from level 2 to level 1, meaning E1 > E2. So if E1 is higher than E2, then the Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ) \u2192 which becomes exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ), which is exp( positive value ). So when T increases, the exponent increases, so the ratio n1/n2 increases.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if E1 is higher than E2, then E2 - E1 is negative. So -(E2 - E1) is positive. So the Boltzmann factor becomes exp( positive value ), which increases with T.\n\nSo when T increases, n1/n2 increases.\n\nIn the problem, when the star has spots, T is lower. So n1/n2 would be lower when T is lower, which aligns with the problem statement.\n\nSo in that case, when T is higher (no spots), n1/n2 is higher. So the ratio R1 (no spots) is higher than R2 (with spots).\n\nSo the factor is R1/R2 = exp( [ (E1 - E2)/(k) ] (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, no, let's re-express it.\n\nWait, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nIf E2 < E1, then E2-E1 is negative. So -(E2-E1) is positive.\n\nSo n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T increases, (E1 - E2)/(k T) decreases, so exp() decreases. So n1/n2 decreases. Hmm, this doesn't make sense with the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.\n\nThe ratio n1/n2 depends on the temperature. The question is, when the temperature decreases, does the ratio increase or decrease?\n\nIf E2 > E1, then the Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T decreases, the denominator is smaller, so the exponent is larger. So exp(-x) becomes smaller as x increases. So when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp( -x ) decreases. So n1/n2 decreases.\n\nWhich aligns with the problem statement: when T decreases (with spots), n1/n2 decreases.\n\nSo in this case, E2 > E1. So when T is higher (no spots), (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so exp(-x) is larger. So n1/n2 is larger.\n\nSo the factor R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, let me recompute the exponent correctly.\n\nWe have R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) )\n\nR2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) + (E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\nFactor out (E2-E1)/(k):\n\n= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBecause 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1 since T2 < T1.\n\nSo (1/T2 -1/T1) is positive, so the exponent is positive.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBut E2-E1 is equal to hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo let's compute this.\n\nWe have:\n\n(E2-E1)/(k) = hc/(\u03bb k)\n\nSo, (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = (hc/(\u03bb k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )\n\nEarlier, I computed (hc/(\u03bb k)) as approximately 9.92e4 K.\n\nNow, (1/T2 -1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1.\n\nCompute that:\n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818\n\n1/6000 \u2248 0.000166667\n\nDifference is 0.000015151 K^-1.\n\nSo 9.92e4 K * 0.000015151 K^-1 = 9.92e4 * 1.5151e-5 \u2248 approx 1.505.\n\nSo the exponent is 1.505.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp(1.505) \u2248 e^1.505 \u2248 ?\n\nWe know that e^1 = 2.718, e^1.5 \u2248 4.4817, e^1.505 is a bit more than that.\n\nCompute e^1.505:\n\nWe can use the Taylor expansion around 1.5.\n\nLet me think, e^1.5 is 4.4816890703.\n\nNow, e^1.505 = e^(1.5 + 0.005) = e^1.5 * e^0.005.\n\ne^0.005 is approximately 1 + 0.005 + (0.005)^2/2 + ... \u2248 1.0050125.\n\nSo e^1.505 \u2248 4.481689 * 1.0050125 \u2248 4.481689 * 1.005 \u2248 4.481689 + (4.481689 * 0.005) = 4.481689 + 0.022408 \u2248 4.504.\n\nSo approximately 4.5.\n\nSo R1/R2 \u2248 4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation in the context of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully and breaking it down.\n\nThe question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. \n\nThe problem is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They want to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 \u00c5, and we can assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) holds in the photosphere.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the key here is to find the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels before and after the star develops spots. The ratio decreases when there are spots, so I'm looking for how much it changes.\n\nI remember from my studies that the ratio of populations of two energy levels in LTE is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the overall photospheric effective temperature changes when the star has spots. So, the temperature of the photosphere when the star has spots is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K).\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. The star's surface isn't uniformly at the same temperature when spots are present. Because the spots are cooler regions, the overall average temperature would drop. But when considering the photosphere, the regions without spots are at 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, say maybe a lower temperature like 5000 K or something? But the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature becomes 5500 K. So the average is lower, but each region (spot and non-spot) has its own temperature.\n\nWait, but the problem says to examine the ratio in the stellar photosphere. And it says the photosphere is in LTE. So, I'm a bit confused about whether the temperature used in the Boltzmann factor is the average or the temperature of the regions without spots. Or perhaps the spots are just a fraction of the surface, but the photospheric temperature overall is 5500 K when spots are present.\n\nWait, the problem says, when the surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the effective temperature is an average, but the photosphere is a mix of regions at 6000 K and cooler regions (spots) at a lower temperature, say T_spot.\n\nBut the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere. So, the photosphere's temperature is the effective temperature when considering all regions. Hmm, but wait, that might not be the case. Because when a star has spots, the total flux (which determines Teff) is lower, but the photospheric regions themselves may have different temperatures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying things by considering that the photosphere as a whole is now at 5500 K when spots are present. Or maybe each region (spot and non-spot) has its own temperature, and the overall photosphere is a mix.\n\nBut the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, which suggests that each region is in LTE, but the overall photosphere's average may not be the same as the temperature used in the Boltzmann factor.\n\nWait, but the ratio of Ti levels would depend on the local temperature where those Ti atoms are. So, if the photosphere is a mix of hot (6000 K) and cool (lower T) regions, then the overall ratio would be a combination of the ratios from each region.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is approximating that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, so the average T is used for the calculation.\n\nWait, the question says that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff drops to 5500 K. So, perhaps when the star has spots, the average T of the photosphere is 5500 K. So, the photosphere's temperature in the presence of spots is 5500 K, and without spots, it's 6000 K.\n\nWait, but no, because the presence of spots would cause the star to emit less flux, hence a lower Teff. So, in reality, the non-spotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at a lower temperature, say T_spot. The effective temperature is the area-weighted average, so when 40% is covered, the effective temperature is 5500 K.\n\nBut the problem is about the photosphere. So, when spots are present, the photosphere's regions are a mix of 60% at 6000 K and 40% at T_spot.\n\nBut the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So, perhaps the overall ratio is an average based on the areas. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the effective temperature is the one to use in the Boltzmann equation, which would be 5500 K when spots are present.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, the problem is considering that the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So, perhaps we should use 5500 K for the Boltzmann factor when spots are present, and 6000 K when they are not.\n\nSo, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 2 to level 1 is given by:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )\n\nBut the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when T decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K, the ratio n2/n1 would decrease because the exponential term would be smaller.\n\nWait, let me think. The energy difference between levels 2 and 1 is E2 - E1. Let's denote \u0394E = E2 - E1. So, the exponent is -\u0394E/(k*T). As T decreases, the denominator becomes smaller, making the exponent more negative. So, exp(-\u0394E/(k T)) becomes smaller, which means n2/n1 becomes smaller. So, when T drops, the ratio decreases, which aligns with the problem statement.\n\nSo, the factor by which the ratio changes is the ratio of (n2/n1) without spots to (n2/n1) with spots.\n\nSo, factor = [ (g2/g1) exp(-\u0394E/(k*6000)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-\u0394E/(k*5500)) ] )\n\nWait, wait, no. Because when the star doesn't have spots, the temperature is 6000 K, so T1 = 6000 K. When it has spots, T2 = 5500 K.\n\nSo, the ratio without spots is R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) )\n\nThe ratio with spots is R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) )\n\nThe factor is R1 / R2 = [ (g2/g1) exp(-\u0394E/(k T1)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-\u0394E/(k T2)) ] )\n\nThe g2/g1 terms cancel out, so factor = exp[ (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nFactor = exp( \u0394E/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the exponents are subtracted.\n\nWait, in the ratio R1/R2, the exponents are:\n\nexp(-\u0394E/(k T1)) / exp(-\u0394E/(k T2)) ) = exp( [ -\u0394E/(k T1) + \u0394E/(k T2) ] )\n\nFactor = exp( \u0394E/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )\n\nWait, yes.\n\nSo, factor = exp( (\u0394E/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBut wait, I need to compute that. However, I don't know \u0394E. But I do have the wavelength of the transition, which is 1448 \u00c5. That corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels.\n\nEnergy difference \u0394E can be found using the relation E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, \u0394E = hc / \u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.\n\nLet me compute \u0394E.\n\nh = 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 2.99792458e8 m/s\n\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s) * (2.998e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m )\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 = approx 1.986e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDivide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.986e-25 / 1.448e-7 \u2248 1.371e-18 J.\n\nBut wait, let me compute this more accurately.\n\nWait, 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 = ?\n\n6.626 * 2.998 \u2248 19.858. So, 19.858e-26 = 1.9858e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDivide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9858e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9858 / 1.448) * 1e-18.\n\n1.9858 / 1.448 \u2248 approx 1.371. So, \u0394E \u2248 1.371e-18 J.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to express this in terms of eV, since Boltzmann's constant is often used with eV.\n\nAlternatively, compute \u0394E in Joules, then convert to eV using 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent term in terms of eV and temperature.\n\nAlternatively, use the relation between wavelength and energy in terms of eV.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the exponent term without explicitly calculating \u0394E.\n\nWait, because the factor is exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBut since \u0394E = hc/\u03bb, we can write:\n\n(\u0394E)/(k) = (hc)/(\u03bb k)\n\nSo, the exponent becomes [ (hc)/(\u03bb k) ) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]\n\nSo,\n\nFactor = exp( (hc)/(\u03bb k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nLet me compute this value.\n\nBut let me compute each part step by step.\n\nCompute hc/(\u03bb k):\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\n\u03bb = 1448e-10 m\n\nk = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nSo,\n\nhc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\n\u03bb k = 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 2.000e-29 J\u00b7m/K\n\nWait,\n\nWait, let me compute hc/(\u03bb k):\n\n(1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K ) )\n\nWait, let's compute denominator: 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = (1.448 * 1.38) e-30.\n\n1.448 * 1.38 \u2248 2.000 (approx 2).\n\nSo denominator \u2248 2e-30 J\u00b7m/K.\n\nNumerator is 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo hc/(\u03bb k) = (1.9878e-25) / (2e-30) ) = approx (1.9878 / 2) * 1e5 \u2248 0.9939e5 \u2248 9.939e4 K.\n\nWait, so hc/(\u03bb k) \u2248 9.939e4 K.\n\nWait, but let me compute more accurately.\n\nCompute 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23:\n\n1.448 *1.38 = let's calculate:\n\n1.4 *1.38 = 1.932\n\n0.048 *1.38= 0.06624 \u2192 total 1.932 + 0.06624 = 1.99824.\n\nSo, 1.448 *1.38 = approx 1.99824.\n\nSo denominator is 1.99824e-30 J\u00b7m/K.\n\nNumerator is 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo hc/(\u03bb k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.99824e-30) ) = (1.9878 / 1.99824 ) * 1e5.\n\n1.9878 / 1.99824 \u2248 0.9947.\n\nSo, approximately 0.9947e5 = 99470 K.\n\nWait, so hc/(\u03bb k) \u2248 99470 K.\n\nSo, the exponent is [ 99470 K * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]\n\nT1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nSo,\n\n1/T2 = 1/5500 \u2248 1.818e-4 K^-1\n\n1/T1 = 1/6000 \u2248 1.6667e-4 K^-1\n\nDifference: 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1513e-4 K^-1 = 1.513e-5 K^-1.\n\nMultiply by 99470 K:\n\n99470 * 1.513e-5 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n99470 * 1.513e-5 = 99470 * (1.513 / 1e5 )\n\nCompute 99470 * 1.513 = ?\n\nWell, 1e5 is 100,000.\n\nSo, 99470 * 1.513 = approx 99470 * 1.5 = 149205, but more accurately:\n\n1.513 * 99470 = ?\n\nLet me compute 99470 * 1.5 = 149205.\n\n99470 * 0.013 = 1293.11.\n\nSo total is 149205 + 1293.11 = 150498.11.\n\nSo, 150498.11 / 1e5 = 1.50498.\n\nSo, the exponent is approximately 1.505.\n\nSo, factor = exp(1.505) \u2248 e^1.505.\n\nWhat's e^1.5? e^1 is about 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.6487.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully and breaking it down.\n\nThe question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. \n\nThe problem is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They want to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 \u00c5, and we can assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) holds in the photosphere.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the key here is to find the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels before and after the star develops spots. The ratio decreases when there are spots, so I'm looking for how much it changes.\n\nI remember from my studies that the ratio of populations of two energy levels in LTE is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the overall photospheric effective temperature changes when the star has spots. So, the temperature of the photosphere when the star has spots is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K).\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. The star's surface isn't uniformly at the same temperature when spots are present. Because the spots are cooler regions, the overall average temperature would drop. But when considering the photosphere, the regions without spots are at 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, say maybe a lower temperature like 5000 K or something? But the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature becomes 5500 K. So the average is lower, but each region (spot and non-spot) has its own temperature.\n\nWait, but the problem says to examine the ratio in the stellar photosphere. And it says the photosphere is in LTE. So, I'm a bit confused about whether the temperature used in the Boltzmann factor is the average or the temperature of the regions without spots. Or perhaps the spots are just a fraction of the surface, but the photospheric temperature overall is 5500 K when spots are present.\n\nWait, the problem says, when the surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the effective temperature is an average, but the photosphere is a mix of regions at 6000 K and cooler regions (spots) at a lower temperature, say T_spot.\n\nBut the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere. So, the photosphere's temperature is the effective temperature when considering all regions. Hmm, but wait, that might not be the case. Because when a star has spots, the total flux (which determines Teff) is lower, but the photospheric regions themselves may have different temperatures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying things by considering that the photosphere as a whole is now at 5500 K when spots are present. Or maybe each region (spot and non-spot) has its own temperature, and the overall photosphere is a mix.\n\nBut the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, which suggests that each region is in LTE, but the overall photosphere's average may not be the same as the temperature used in the Boltzmann factor.\n\nWait, but the ratio of Ti levels would depend on the local temperature where those Ti atoms are. So, if the photosphere is a mix of hot (6000 K) and cool (lower T) regions, then the overall ratio would be a combination of the ratios from each region.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is approximating that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, so the average T is used for the calculation.\n\nWait, the question says that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff drops to 5500 K. So, perhaps when the star has spots, the average T of the photosphere is 5500 K. So, the photosphere's temperature in the presence of spots is 5500 K, and without spots, it's 6000 K.\n\nWait, but no, because the presence of spots would cause the star to emit less flux, hence a lower Teff. So, in reality, the non-spotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at a lower temperature, say T_spot. The effective temperature is the area-weighted average, so when 40% is covered, the effective temperature is 5500 K.\n\nBut the problem is about the photosphere. So, when spots are present, the photosphere's regions are a mix of 60% at 6000 K and 40% at T_spot.\n\nBut the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So, perhaps the overall ratio is an average based on the areas. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the effective temperature is the one to use in the Boltzmann equation, which would be 5500 K when spots are present.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, the problem is considering that the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So, perhaps we should use 5500 K for the Boltzmann factor when spots are present, and 6000 K when they are not.\n\nSo, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 2 to level 1 is given by:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )\n\nBut the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when T decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K, the ratio n2/n1 would decrease because the exponential term would be smaller.\n\nWait, let me think. The energy difference between levels 2 and 1 is E2 - E1. Let's denote \u0394E = E2 - E1. So, the exponent is -\u0394E/(k*T). As T decreases, the denominator becomes smaller, making the exponent more negative. So, exp(-\u0394E/(k T)) becomes smaller, which means n2/n1 becomes smaller. So, when T drops, the ratio decreases, which aligns with the problem statement.\n\nSo, the factor by which the ratio changes is the ratio of (n2/n1) without spots to (n2/n1) with spots.\n\nSo, factor = [ (g2/g1) exp(-\u0394E/(k*6000)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-\u0394E/(k*5500)) ] )\n\nWait, wait, no. Because when the star doesn't have spots, the temperature is 6000 K, so T1 = 6000 K. When it has spots, T2 = 5500 K.\n\nSo, the ratio without spots is R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) )\n\nThe ratio with spots is R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) )\n\nThe factor is R1 / R2 = [ (g2/g1) exp(-\u0394E/(k T1)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-\u0394E/(k T2)) ] )\n\nThe g2/g1 terms cancel out, so factor = exp[ (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nFactor = exp( \u0394E/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the exponents are subtracted.\n\nWait, in the ratio R1/R2, the exponents are:\n\nexp(-\u0394E/(k T1)) / exp(-\u0394E/(k T2)) ) = exp( [ -\u0394E/(k T1) + \u0394E/(k T2) ] )\n\nFactor = exp( \u0394E/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )\n\nWait, yes.\n\nSo, factor = exp( (\u0394E/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBut wait, I need to compute that. However, I don't know \u0394E. But I do have the wavelength of the transition, which is 1448 \u00c5. That corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels.\n\nEnergy difference \u0394E can be found using the relation E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, \u0394E = hc / \u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.\n\nLet me compute \u0394E.\n\nh = 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 2.99792458e8 m/s\n\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s) * (2.998e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m )\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 = approx 1.986e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDivide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.986e-25 / 1.448e-7 \u2248 1.371e-18 J.\n\nBut wait, let me compute this more accurately.\n\nWait, 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 = ?\n\n6.626 * 2.998 \u2248 19.858. So, 19.858e-26 = 1.9858e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDivide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9858e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9858 / 1.448) * 1e-18.\n\n1.9858 / 1.448 \u2248 approx 1.371. So, \u0394E \u2248 1.371e-18 J.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to express this in terms of eV, since Boltzmann's constant is often used with eV.\n\nAlternatively, compute \u0394E in Joules, then convert to eV using 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent term in terms of eV and temperature.\n\nAlternatively, use the relation between wavelength and energy in terms of eV.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the exponent term without explicitly calculating \u0394E.\n\nWait, because the factor is exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBut since \u0394E = hc/\u03bb, we can write:\n\n(\u0394E)/(k) = (hc)/(\u03bb k)\n\nSo, the exponent becomes [ (hc)/(\u03bb k) ) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]\n\nSo,\n\nFactor = exp( (hc)/(\u03bb k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nLet me compute this value.\n\nBut let me compute each part step by step.\n\nCompute hc/(\u03bb k):\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\n\u03bb = 1448e-10 m\n\nk = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nSo,\n\nhc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\n\u03bb k = 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 2.000e-29 J\u00b7m/K\n\nWait,\n\nWait, let me compute hc/(\u03bb k):\n\n(1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K ) )\n\nWait, let's compute denominator: 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = (1.448 * 1.38) e-30.\n\n1.448 * 1.38 \u2248 2.000 (approx 2).\n\nSo denominator \u2248 2e-30 J\u00b7m/K.\n\nNumerator is 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo hc/(\u03bb k) = (1.9878e-25) / (2e-30) ) = approx (1.9878 / 2) * 1e5 \u2248 0.9939e5 \u2248 9.939e4 K.\n\nWait, so hc/(\u03bb k) \u2248 9.939e4 K.\n\nWait, but let me compute more accurately.\n\nCompute 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23:\n\n1.448 *1.38 = let's calculate:\n\n1.4 *1.38 = 1.932\n\n0.048 *1.38= 0.06624 \u2192 total 1.932 + 0.06624 = 1.99824.\n\nSo, 1.448 *1.38 = approx 1.99824.\n\nSo denominator is 1.99824e-30 J\u00b7m/K.\n\nNumerator is 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo hc/(\u03bb k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.99824e-30) ) = (1.9878 / 1.99824 ) * 1e5.\n\n1.9878 / 1.99824 \u2248 0.9947.\n\nSo, approximately 0.9947e5 = 99470 K.\n\nWait, so hc/(\u03bb k) \u2248 99470 K.\n\nSo, the exponent is [ 99470 K * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]\n\nT1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nSo,\n\n1/T2 = 1/5500 \u2248 1.818e-4 K^-1\n\n1/T1 = 1/6000 \u2248 1.6667e-4 K^-1\n\nDifference: 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1513e-4 K^-1 = 1.513e-5 K^-1.\n\nMultiply by 99470 K:\n\n99470 * 1.513e-5 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n99470 * 1.513e-5 = 99470 * (1.513 / 1e5 )\n\nCompute 99470 * 1.513 = ?\n\nWell, 1e5 is 100,000.\n\nSo, 99470 * 1.513 = approx 99470 * 1.5 = 149205, but more accurately:\n\n1.513 * 99470 = ?\n\nLet me compute 99470 * 1.5 = 149205.\n\n99470 * 0.013 = 1293.11.\n\nSo total is 149205 + 1293.11 = 150498.11.\n\nSo, 150498.11 / 1e5 = 1.50498.\n\nSo, the exponent is approximately 1.505.\n\nSo, factor = exp(1.505) \u2248 e^1.505.\n\nWhat's e^1.5? e^1 is about 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.6487.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about stars with dark spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, okay, I remember a bit about stellar atmospheres and the Boltzmann equation from my studies.\n\nAlright, let's break down the problem. So, there's a star with 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When it doesn't have spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They say that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when it has spots.\n\nWait, so the ratio N1/N2 (where N1 is the number of atoms in level 1 and N2 in level 2) decreases when there are spots. So normally, without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. We need to find how much higher it is without spots.\n\nI remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)). So the ratio depends on the statistical weights (g factors) and the temperature.\n\nBut wait, the transition wavelength is given as about 1448 \u00c5. That's in the near-ultraviolet range. I think the energy difference between the levels can be found using the relation E = hc/\u03bb. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given data:\n\n- Teff without spots (T1) = 6000 K\n- Teff with spots (T2) = 5500 K\n- Fraction of surface covered by spots = 40% (but I'm not sure if that affects this particular calculation)\n- Wavelength \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 meters\n- The ratio N1/N2 decreases when there are spots, so N1/N2 is higher without spots.\n\nWait, but the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, N1/N2 is lower. So without spots, the ratio is higher, so the factor is N1/N2 (without spots) divided by N1/N2 (with spots), which would be greater than 1.\n\nWait, no, wait. The ratio is N1/N2. Without spots, the ratio is higher, so the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots = some number greater than 1. But the options are given as the factor, so we need to compute that.\n\nSo, using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ) / (g1/g2). Wait, let me get this right. The Boltzmann factor is for the population ratio. So the equation is:\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, rearranged, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nIf E2 > E1, then the exponential term would be positive. So when T increases, the exponential term increases, making N1/N2 larger if E2 > E1. Because higher temperature would make higher energy states more populated, so N2 increases relative to N1, but in this case, the ratio is N1/N2. Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, when T increases, the exponential term (E2-E1)/(k T) is a positive number divided by a larger denominator, so it's smaller. So exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases as T increases because the exponent becomes smaller but positive. Wait no, wait. Let's think in terms of (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. When T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, so exp(smaller positive) is larger because it's closer to 1. So, for example, exp(0.1) is about 1.105, exp(0.05) is about 1.051. So as T increases, exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases, because the exponent is smaller, so the value approaches 1 from above.\n\nSo, if T increases, N1/N2 increases, because the exponential term is getting larger. Wait no, because N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, no, let's make it precise. Let me compute the ratio.\n\nLet me define \u0394E = E2 - E1. If \u0394E is positive, which it is because level 2 is higher in energy.\n\nSo N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( \u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo if T increases, \u0394E/(k T) decreases, so exp(\u0394E/(k T)) increases (since the exponent is smaller but still positive, e^x increases as x increases, but wait wait no, wait. Wait, if x is smaller, e^x is smaller. Wait, no. Let me think. For example, when x is 0.1, e^x is 1.105. When x is 0.05, e^x is 1.051. So when x decreases, e^x decreases. Oh wait, I'm getting this wrong. So when T increases, \u0394E/(k T) decreases, so exp(\u0394E/(k T)) decreases. So N1/N2 would decrease because the exponential term is smaller. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it another way. When temperature is higher, more atoms can be excited to higher energy levels. So level 2 is higher than level 1. So at higher T, more atoms are in level 2, so N2 increases relative to N1. Therefore, N1/N2 decreases when T increases. Oh wait, that makes sense. So if T increases, N2 increases more than N1, so N1/N2 decreases.\n\nSo in our problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K) compared to when it's spotless (6000 K). So without spots, the Teff is higher, leading to a lower N1/N2 ratio. Wait, no: when Teff is higher, N1/N2 is lower, as we just saw. So when the star has spots, Teff is 5500 K, which is lower. So N1/N2 would be higher because T is lower, making the exponential term smaller, so N1/N2 is higher.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the problem statement. The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. But according to this, when T is lower, N1/N2 is higher. So that's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So without spots, T is 6000 K. Then, the ratio N1/N2 is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So when T is lower (5500 K), N1/N2 is lower. But according to the earlier reasoning, lower T would lead to higher N1/N2. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps I messed up the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the equation correctly. Let me double-check.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by:\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\nN1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1) / (k T) )\n\nSo, E2 > E1, so the exponent is positive. When T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) decreases, making N1/N2 smaller. So when T increases, N1/N2 decreases.\n\nAh, okay, that's correct. So when T increases, N1/N2 decreases. So when the star has spots, T drops to 5500 K. So N1/N2 increases because T is lower. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that suggests that when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower. Which contradicts the equation. So perhaps I've got the ratio backwards.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio as N2/N1. Let me read the problem again. The question says, 'the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)'. It says the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\n\nSo, the ratio is N1/N2. When the star has spots, this ratio is lower. But according to the equation, when T decreases, N1/N2 increases. So this seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the effect. Let me think again.\n\nIf T increases, then (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller, so exp(\u0394E/(k T)) is smaller. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(\u0394E/(k T)) is smaller. So higher T leads to smaller N1/N2. So when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K), so N1/N2 should be higher. But the problem says it's lower when the star has spots.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. That suggests that the ratio N1/N2 is lower when T is lower. But according to the equation, that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe I've got the ratio backwards. Suppose the problem is considering N2/N1. Because if N2/N1 increases when T increases, then when the star has spots, T is lower, so N2/N1 would be lower. Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says the ratio of N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So that would mean that when T is lower, the ratio is lower. But according to our equation, when T is lower, N1/N2 is higher. So perhaps I'm getting the ratio wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually considering the inverse ratio, N2/N1. Let's think again.\n\nLet me suppose that the observed ratio is N2/N1. Then, when the star has spots, T is lower, so N2/N1 would be lower, because when T decreases, the exponential term in N2/N1 would decrease.\n\nWait, let's see. N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T is lower, -\u0394E/(k T) is a more negative number (since T is smaller, denominator is smaller, so the whole term is more negative). So exp(negative number) becomes smaller. So N2/N1 would decrease as T decreases. So if the ratio is N2/N1, then when T is lower, the ratio is lower. Which matches the problem statement.\n\nBut the problem says the ratio of N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So that would mean that N1/N2 is higher when T is lower. Which doesn't match the equation unless the ratio is N2/N1.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should re-examine the question.\n\nThe problem says: 'the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.' So the ratio is N1/N2.\n\nSo, according to the equation, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo when T decreases, \u0394E/(k T) increases (since denominator is smaller), so exp(\u0394E/(k T)) increases. So N1/N2 increases when T decreases. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so N1/N2 is higher, which contradicts the problem statement which says the ratio decreases.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding which level is which.\n\nWait, perhaps level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. No, the problem says 'energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)'. It doesn't specify which is higher. Oh, that's a crucial point. I assumed that level 2 is higher than level 1, but maybe level 1 is higher. Because the problem doesn't specify, I have to make an assumption. Let me think.\n\nWait, in spectroscopy, usually, when you talk about a transition from a lower to a higher energy level, you have an absorption line. So the lower level is level 1 and the higher is level 2. So if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E2 > E1.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify that. Hmm. So perhaps I should think about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me proceed under the assumption that E2 > E1. So level 2 is higher in energy. So, according to the equation, when T decreases, N1/N2 increases. But the problem says that N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots (i.e., when T is lower). So this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is actually N2/N1. Let me assume that the observed ratio is N2/N1. Then, when T decreases, N2/N1 would decrease, which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo perhaps the question has a typo, and the ratio is N2/N1. Or perhaps I misread it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference is E1 - E2. Let me think. Suppose E1 > E2. So \u0394E = E2 - E1 would be negative. So then, the exponential term would be exp(\u0394E/(k T)) = exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo in that case, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential increases (since it's exp of a negative number). So N1/N2 would be (g1/g2) * exp(\u0394E/(k T)) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nWhich, when E1 > E2 and T increases, -(E1-E2)/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp increases. So N1/N2 increases. But that would mean that when T increases, N1/N2 increases, which is the opposite of what we saw earlier.\n\nBut this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that E2 > E1 and see where that leads me, despite the contradiction.\n\nSo, given that, when the star has spots, T drops to 5500 K, so N1/N2 increases. But the problem says that N1/N2 decreases. So perhaps the assumption is incorrect, and the observed ratio is N2/N1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, which would imply that the energy difference is E1 - E2. So let's proceed with that.\n\nWait, no, the transition's wavelength is given. The wavelength corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels. So regardless of which level is higher, the energy difference can be calculated.\n\nSo, let's compute the energy difference \u0394E between the two levels.\n\nUsing the equation E = hc / \u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nc is the speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo, E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J per photon.\n\nWait, that's a very small energy. But that's okay.\n\nWe can also express this energy in terms of eV, since we're dealing with atomic transitions.\n\n1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nWait, that's a big jump. Wait, 1.372e-18 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV is (1.372 / 0.1602) eV \u2248 8.56 eV. Hmm, that's a large energy difference for a transition in neutral Ti. Titanium's ionization energy is about 6.9 eV, so neutral Ti can't have a transition of 8.56 eV because that's higher than the ionization energy. So that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate.\n\nWait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDivided by 1.448e-7 m (since 1448e-10 is 1.448e-7 meters).\n\nSo E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 J.\n\n1.9878 / 1.448 is approximately 1.373, so E \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 8.57 eV.\n\nHmm, that's way too high. So perhaps I made a mistake in the wavelength. Wait, 1448 \u00c5 is 1448 Angstroms, which is 0.1448 nanometers. Wait, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 1448 Angstroms is 144.8 nm. Hmm, that's in the UV range. So the energy should be in the eV range, but perhaps 8.5 eV is too high.\n\nWait, let me think. The energy levels in atoms are typically a few eV. For example, hydrogen's highest energy level in the visible spectrum is about 10.2 eV (from n=1 to n=2 is about 10.2 eV, but that's ionization). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, hydrogen's ionization energy is about 13.6 eV. The transition from n=2 to n=1 is 10.2 eV, which is in the UV (about 121 nm). So 1448 \u00c5 is about 144.8 nm, which is longer than 121 nm, so the energy should be lower than 10.2 eV.\n\nWait, my calculation gave me 8.5 eV, which is about 144 nm. Hmm, that seems correct because 144 nm is in the UV. But why is the energy so high for neutral Ti?\n\nWait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me try again.\n\nCompute E in Joules:\n\nE = hc / \u03bb\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\n\u03bb = 1448e-10 m\n\nSo, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10)\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo, E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.57 eV.\n\nHmm, that's correct. But as I thought, for neutral Ti, the ionization energy is around 6.9 eV, so the transition energy of 8.5 eV would require ionization. So perhaps the levels are from neutral Ti to singly ionized Ti. But the problem states that we're considering neutral Ti atoms, so perhaps the energy difference is lower. Wait, but the problem says 'neutral atoms of Ti', so the transition must be within neutral Ti.\n\nSo I'm confused. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it again.\n\nWait, 1448 Angstroms is 1448 * 1e-10 meters, which is 1.448e-7 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem has a mistake, but I'll proceed.\n\nNow, the Boltzmann factor is (E2-E1)/(k T). Let's compute (E2-E1)/(k T) for both temperatures.\n\nk is Boltzmann's constant, 1.380649e-23 J/K.\n\nSo, for T1 = 6000 K:\n\n\u0394E/(k T1) = (8.57 eV) * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K)\n\nWait, because E is in eV, we need to convert it to Joules.\n\nSo, E = 8.57 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E/(k T) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T)\n\nSo for T1 = 6000 K:\n\nDenominator: 1.38e-23 * 6000 = 8.28e-20\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E/(k T1) = 1.373e-18 / 8.28e-20 \u2248 16.58.\n\nSimilarly, for T2 = 5500 K:\n\nDenominator: 1.38e-23 *5500 = 7.59e-20.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E/(k T2) = 1.373e-18 /7.59e-20 \u2248 18.06.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because as T decreases, \u0394E/(k T) increases. So for T1=6000 K, it's about 16.58, and T2=5500 K, it's about 18.06. So the exponent is larger for T2.\n\nWait, but that's a huge exponent. For example, exp(16.58) is a gigantic number. But in reality, the energy levels can't have such a high ratio.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, E is 8.57 eV. To convert to Joules, 8.57 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E/(k T) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T)\n\nSo for T=6000 K:\n\n1.38e-23 *6000 = 8.28e-20.\n\nSo 1.373e-18 /8.28e-20 = (1.373 / 8.28) * 1e2 \u2248 0.1658 * 100 \u2248 16.58.\n\nSimilarly, for T=5500 K:\n\n1.38e-23 *5500 = 7.59e-20.\n\n1.373e-18 /7.59e-20 = (1.373 /7.59) * 1e2 \u2248 0.1806 *100\u224818.06.\n\nSo, the exponents are 16.58 and 18.06.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because these exponents are way beyond any practical values. For example, exp(16) is about 1e7, but exp(16.58) is about 1e7.18, which is around 1.5e7. So the ratio N1/N2 would be (g1/g2) multiplied by exp(\u0394E/(k T)).\n\nBut for T=6000 K, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(16.58). For T=5500 K, it's (g1/g2) * exp(18.06). So the ratio would be (exp(18.06)/exp(16.58)) = exp(1.48) \u2248 4.38.\n\nWait, but that would mean that N1/N2 is higher when T is lower, which contradicts the problem statement. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So according to this, the ratio increases when T decreases, which contradicts the observation.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is considering the inverse ratio, N2/N1. Let me think.\n\nIf the ratio is N2/N1, then the ratio would be (g2/g1) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo, for T1=6000 K:\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -16.58 )\n\nSimilarly, for T2=5500 K:\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -18.06 )\n\nSo, the ratio at T1 is much larger than at T2. Because exp(-16.58) is about 2.7e-7, and exp(-18.06) is about 1.4e-8.\n\nSo, the ratio N2/N1 is higher when T is higher, and lower when T is lower. So if the problem observes that N1/N2 decreases when spots are present (T is lower), that would imply that N2/N1 increases when T is lower, which is not the case. Wait, no, if N1/N2 decreases, then N2/N1 increases.\n\nWait, let me think. If N1/N2 decreases, then N2/N1 increases.\n\nSo, when the star has spots (lower T), N1/N2 is lower. So, N2/N1 is higher.\n\nBut according to the calculation, N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nAt T=6000 K, exp(-16.58) = 2.7e-7.\n\nAt T=5500 K, exp(-18.06)=1.4e-8.\n\nSo N2/N1 is lower at T=5500 K than at T=6000 K.\n\nWait, no, 1.4e-8 is smaller than 2.7e-7, so N2/N1 is lower when T is lower.\n\nBut the problem says that when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower, which implies N2/N1 is higher. So that's a contradiction.\n\nI'm getting really stuck here. Maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the problem is not about the ratio of N1 to N2, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the ratios. Let me denote the ratio R = N1/N2.\n\nWithout spots, R1 = (g1/g2) * exp(\u0394E/(k T1) )\n\nWith spots, R2 = (g1/g2) * exp(\u0394E/(k T2) )\n\nSo the factor by which R changes is R1/R2 = exp(\u0394E/(k T1) - \u0394E/(k T2) )\n\n= exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\u0394E = 8.57 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nk = 1.38e-23 J/K.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) \u2248 9.955e4 K.\n\nSo,\n\n(1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 *5500) )\n\n= (-500) / (33,000,000) ) = -5e2 / 3.3e7 = approx -1.515e-5.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) = 9.955e4 K * (-1.515e-5) \u2248 -1.506.\n\nSo,\n\nR1/R2 = exp(-1.506) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo, the ratio R1/R2 is about 0.221, which is less than 1. So the ratio without spots is 0.221 times the ratio with spots. That would mean that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which matches the problem statement.\n\nWait, but according to this, R1 = N1/N2 without spots, R2 = N1/N2 with spots. So R1/R2 is the factor by which the ratio changes. So if R1/R2 is 0.221, that would mean that without spots, the ratio is 0.221 times the ratio when there are spots. So the ratio is smaller without spots, which contradicts the problem statement which says the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\n\nWait, no, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So R2 < R1.\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, R1/R2 = 0.221, which is less than 1, implying R1 < R2. That's the opposite of what the problem states.\n\nHmm, this is getting too confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the sign. Let me compute (1/T1 - 1/T2).\n\nT1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\n1/T1 = 1/6000 \u2248 1.6667e-4.\n\n1/T2 = 1/5500 \u2248 1.8182e-4.\n\nSo,\n\n1/T1 - 1/T2 = 1.6667e-4 - 1.8182e-4 = -1.515e-5.\n\nSo, the exponent is \u0394E/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) = 9.955e4 * (-1.515e-5) \u2248 -1.506.\n\nSo exp(-1.506) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo R1/R2 = 0.221.\n\nWhich implies R1 = 0.221 * R2.\n\nSo R1 < R2. Which means that without spots, the ratio is lower than when there are spots. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases, meaning R2 < R1.\n\nSo this suggests that my calculation is wrong, or perhaps I've misapplied the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is N2/N1. Let me compute that.\n\nIf R = N2/N1, then R1/R2 = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBecause R = (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( (-\u0394E/(k T1)) - (-\u0394E/(k T2)) ) )\n\n= exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )\n\nWhich is exp( \u0394E/(k) ( - (1/T1 -1/T2) ) )\n\nWhich is exp( - (\u0394E/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) ) )\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) = 9.955e4 * (-1.515e-5) \u2248 -1.506.\n\nSo,\n\nR1/R2 = exp( 1.506 ) \u2248 4.50.\n\nSo, the factor by which R changes is about 4.5. So R1 = 4.5 * R2.\n\nWhich would mean that without spots, the ratio R = N2/N1 is higher than when there are spots. So when the star has spots, R decreases, which matches the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem states that the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So if R = N2/N1, then R increases when the star has spots, which would mean that N1/N2 decreases.\n\nWait, no, R = N2/N1. If R increases, then N2/N1 increases, so N1/N2 decreases.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the problem says N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So R = N2/N1 increases, so R1/R2 = 4.5. So the factor is 4.5.\n\nSo the factor by which the ratio changes (R1/R2) is 4.5.\n\nSo looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about stars with dark spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, okay, I remember a bit about stellar atmospheres and the Boltzmann equation from my studies.\n\nAlright, let's break down the problem. So, there's a star with 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When it doesn't have spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They say that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when it has spots.\n\nWait, so the ratio N1/N2 (where N1 is the number of atoms in level 1 and N2 in level 2) decreases when there are spots. So normally, without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. We need to find how much higher it is without spots.\n\nI remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)). So the ratio depends on the statistical weights (g factors) and the temperature.\n\nBut wait, the transition wavelength is given as about 1448 \u00c5. That's in the near-ultraviolet range. I think the energy difference between the levels can be found using the relation E = hc/\u03bb. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given data:\n\n- Teff without spots (T1) = 6000 K\n- Teff with spots (T2) = 5500 K\n- Fraction of surface covered by spots = 40% (but I'm not sure if that affects this particular calculation)\n- Wavelength \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 meters\n- The ratio N1/N2 decreases when there are spots, so N1/N2 is higher without spots.\n\nWait, but the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, N1/N2 is lower. So without spots, the ratio is higher, so the factor is N1/N2 (without spots) divided by N1/N2 (with spots), which would be greater than 1.\n\nWait, no, wait. The ratio is N1/N2. Without spots, the ratio is higher, so the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots = some number greater than 1. But the options are given as the factor, so we need to compute that.\n\nSo, using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ) / (g1/g2). Wait, let me get this right. The Boltzmann factor is for the population ratio. So the equation is:\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, rearranged, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nIf E2 > E1, then the exponential term would be positive. So when T increases, the exponential term increases, making N1/N2 larger if E2 > E1. Because higher temperature would make higher energy states more populated, so N2 increases relative to N1, but in this case, the ratio is N1/N2. Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, when T increases, the exponential term (E2-E1)/(k T) is a positive number divided by a larger denominator, so it's smaller. So exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases as T increases because the exponent becomes smaller but positive. Wait no, wait. Let's think in terms of (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. When T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, so exp(smaller positive) is larger because it's closer to 1. So, for example, exp(0.1) is about 1.105, exp(0.05) is about 1.051. So as T increases, exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases, because the exponent is smaller, so the value approaches 1 from above.\n\nSo, if T increases, N1/N2 increases, because the exponential term is getting larger. Wait no, because N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, no, let's make it precise. Let me compute the ratio.\n\nLet me define \u0394E = E2 - E1. If \u0394E is positive, which it is because level 2 is higher in energy.\n\nSo N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( \u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo if T increases, \u0394E/(k T) decreases, so exp(\u0394E/(k T)) increases (since the exponent is smaller but still positive, e^x increases as x increases, but wait wait no, wait. Wait, if x is smaller, e^x is smaller. Wait, no. Let me think. For example, when x is 0.1, e^x is 1.105. When x is 0.05, e^x is 1.051. So when x decreases, e^x decreases. Oh wait, I'm getting this wrong. So when T increases, \u0394E/(k T) decreases, so exp(\u0394E/(k T)) decreases. So N1/N2 would decrease because the exponential term is smaller. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it another way. When temperature is higher, more atoms can be excited to higher energy levels. So level 2 is higher than level 1. So at higher T, more atoms are in level 2, so N2 increases relative to N1. Therefore, N1/N2 decreases when T increases. Oh wait, that makes sense. So if T increases, N2 increases more than N1, so N1/N2 decreases.\n\nSo in our problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K) compared to when it's spotless (6000 K). So without spots, the Teff is higher, leading to a lower N1/N2 ratio. Wait, no: when Teff is higher, N1/N2 is lower, as we just saw. So when the star has spots, Teff is 5500 K, which is lower. So N1/N2 would be higher because T is lower, making the exponential term smaller, so N1/N2 is higher.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the problem statement. The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. But according to this, when T is lower, N1/N2 is higher. So that's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So without spots, T is 6000 K. Then, the ratio N1/N2 is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So when T is lower (5500 K), N1/N2 is lower. But according to the earlier reasoning, lower T would lead to higher N1/N2. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps I messed up the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the equation correctly. Let me double-check.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by:\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\nN1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1) / (k T) )\n\nSo, E2 > E1, so the exponent is positive. When T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) decreases, making N1/N2 smaller. So when T increases, N1/N2 decreases.\n\nAh, okay, that's correct. So when T increases, N1/N2 decreases. So when the star has spots, T drops to 5500 K. So N1/N2 increases because T is lower. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that suggests that when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower. Which contradicts the equation. So perhaps I've got the ratio backwards.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio as N2/N1. Let me read the problem again. The question says, 'the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)'. It says the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\n\nSo, the ratio is N1/N2. When the star has spots, this ratio is lower. But according to the equation, when T decreases, N1/N2 increases. So this seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the effect. Let me think again.\n\nIf T increases, then (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller, so exp(\u0394E/(k T)) is smaller. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(\u0394E/(k T)) is smaller. So higher T leads to smaller N1/N2. So when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K), so N1/N2 should be higher. But the problem says it's lower when the star has spots.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. That suggests that the ratio N1/N2 is lower when T is lower. But according to the equation, that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe I've got the ratio backwards. Suppose the problem is considering N2/N1. Because if N2/N1 increases when T increases, then when the star has spots, T is lower, so N2/N1 would be lower. Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says the ratio of N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So that would mean that when T is lower, the ratio is lower. But according to our equation, when T is lower, N1/N2 is higher. So perhaps I'm getting the ratio wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually considering the inverse ratio, N2/N1. Let's think again.\n\nLet me suppose that the observed ratio is N2/N1. Then, when the star has spots, T is lower, so N2/N1 would be lower, because when T decreases, the exponential term in N2/N1 would decrease.\n\nWait, let's see. N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T is lower, -\u0394E/(k T) is a more negative number (since T is smaller, denominator is smaller, so the whole term is more negative). So exp(negative number) becomes smaller. So N2/N1 would decrease as T decreases. So if the ratio is N2/N1, then when T is lower, the ratio is lower. Which matches the problem statement.\n\nBut the problem says the ratio of N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So that would mean that N1/N2 is higher when T is lower. Which doesn't match the equation unless the ratio is N2/N1.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should re-examine the question.\n\nThe problem says: 'the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.' So the ratio is N1/N2.\n\nSo, according to the equation, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo when T decreases, \u0394E/(k T) increases (since denominator is smaller), so exp(\u0394E/(k T)) increases. So N1/N2 increases when T decreases. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so N1/N2 is higher, which contradicts the problem statement which says the ratio decreases.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding which level is which.\n\nWait, perhaps level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. No, the problem says 'energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)'. It doesn't specify which is higher. Oh, that's a crucial point. I assumed that level 2 is higher than level 1, but maybe level 1 is higher. Because the problem doesn't specify, I have to make an assumption. Let me think.\n\nWait, in spectroscopy, usually, when you talk about a transition from a lower to a higher energy level, you have an absorption line. So the lower level is level 1 and the higher is level 2. So if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E2 > E1.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify that. Hmm. So perhaps I should think about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me proceed under the assumption that E2 > E1. So level 2 is higher in energy. So, according to the equation, when T decreases, N1/N2 increases. But the problem says that N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots (i.e., when T is lower). So this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is actually N2/N1. Let me assume that the observed ratio is N2/N1. Then, when T decreases, N2/N1 would decrease, which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo perhaps the question has a typo, and the ratio is N2/N1. Or perhaps I misread it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference is E1 - E2. Let me think. Suppose E1 > E2. So \u0394E = E2 - E1 would be negative. So then, the exponential term would be exp(\u0394E/(k T)) = exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo in that case, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential increases (since it's exp of a negative number). So N1/N2 would be (g1/g2) * exp(\u0394E/(k T)) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nWhich, when E1 > E2 and T increases, -(E1-E2)/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp increases. So N1/N2 increases. But that would mean that when T increases, N1/N2 increases, which is the opposite of what we saw earlier.\n\nBut this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that E2 > E1 and see where that leads me, despite the contradiction.\n\nSo, given that, when the star has spots, T drops to 5500 K, so N1/N2 increases. But the problem says that N1/N2 decreases. So perhaps the assumption is incorrect, and the observed ratio is N2/N1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, which would imply that the energy difference is E1 - E2. So let's proceed with that.\n\nWait, no, the transition's wavelength is given. The wavelength corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels. So regardless of which level is higher, the energy difference can be calculated.\n\nSo, let's compute the energy difference \u0394E between the two levels.\n\nUsing the equation E = hc / \u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nc is the speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo, E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J per photon.\n\nWait, that's a very small energy. But that's okay.\n\nWe can also express this energy in terms of eV, since we're dealing with atomic transitions.\n\n1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nWait, that's a big jump. Wait, 1.372e-18 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV is (1.372 / 0.1602) eV \u2248 8.56 eV. Hmm, that's a large energy difference for a transition in neutral Ti. Titanium's ionization energy is about 6.9 eV, so neutral Ti can't have a transition of 8.56 eV because that's higher than the ionization energy. So that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate.\n\nWait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDivided by 1.448e-7 m (since 1448e-10 is 1.448e-7 meters).\n\nSo E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 J.\n\n1.9878 / 1.448 is approximately 1.373, so E \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 8.57 eV.\n\nHmm, that's way too high. So perhaps I made a mistake in the wavelength. Wait, 1448 \u00c5 is 1448 Angstroms, which is 0.1448 nanometers. Wait, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 1448 Angstroms is 144.8 nm. Hmm, that's in the UV range. So the energy should be in the eV range, but perhaps 8.5 eV is too high.\n\nWait, let me think. The energy levels in atoms are typically a few eV. For example, hydrogen's highest energy level in the visible spectrum is about 10.2 eV (from n=1 to n=2 is about 10.2 eV, but that's ionization). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, hydrogen's ionization energy is about 13.6 eV. The transition from n=2 to n=1 is 10.2 eV, which is in the UV (about 121 nm). So 1448 \u00c5 is about 144.8 nm, which is longer than 121 nm, so the energy should be lower than 10.2 eV.\n\nWait, my calculation gave me 8.5 eV, which is about 144 nm. Hmm, that seems correct because 144 nm is in the UV. But why is the energy so high for neutral Ti?\n\nWait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me try again.\n\nCompute E in Joules:\n\nE = hc / \u03bb\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\n\u03bb = 1448e-10 m\n\nSo, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10)\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo, E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.57 eV.\n\nHmm, that's correct. But as I thought, for neutral Ti, the ionization energy is around 6.9 eV, so the transition energy of 8.5 eV would require ionization. So perhaps the levels are from neutral Ti to singly ionized Ti. But the problem states that we're considering neutral Ti atoms, so perhaps the energy difference is lower. Wait, but the problem says 'neutral atoms of Ti', so the transition must be within neutral Ti.\n\nSo I'm confused. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it again.\n\nWait, 1448 Angstroms is 1448 * 1e-10 meters, which is 1.448e-7 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem has a mistake, but I'll proceed.\n\nNow, the Boltzmann factor is (E2-E1)/(k T). Let's compute (E2-E1)/(k T) for both temperatures.\n\nk is Boltzmann's constant, 1.380649e-23 J/K.\n\nSo, for T1 = 6000 K:\n\n\u0394E/(k T1) = (8.57 eV) * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K)\n\nWait, because E is in eV, we need to convert it to Joules.\n\nSo, E = 8.57 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E/(k T) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T)\n\nSo for T1 = 6000 K:\n\nDenominator: 1.38e-23 * 6000 = 8.28e-20\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E/(k T1) = 1.373e-18 / 8.28e-20 \u2248 16.58.\n\nSimilarly, for T2 = 5500 K:\n\nDenominator: 1.38e-23 *5500 = 7.59e-20.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E/(k T2) = 1.373e-18 /7.59e-20 \u2248 18.06.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because as T decreases, \u0394E/(k T) increases. So for T1=6000 K, it's about 16.58, and T2=5500 K, it's about 18.06. So the exponent is larger for T2.\n\nWait, but that's a huge exponent. For example, exp(16.58) is a gigantic number. But in reality, the energy levels can't have such a high ratio.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, E is 8.57 eV. To convert to Joules, 8.57 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E/(k T) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T)\n\nSo for T=6000 K:\n\n1.38e-23 *6000 = 8.28e-20.\n\nSo 1.373e-18 /8.28e-20 = (1.373 / 8.28) * 1e2 \u2248 0.1658 * 100 \u2248 16.58.\n\nSimilarly, for T=5500 K:\n\n1.38e-23 *5500 = 7.59e-20.\n\n1.373e-18 /7.59e-20 = (1.373 /7.59) * 1e2 \u2248 0.1806 *100\u224818.06.\n\nSo, the exponents are 16.58 and 18.06.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because these exponents are way beyond any practical values. For example, exp(16) is about 1e7, but exp(16.58) is about 1e7.18, which is around 1.5e7. So the ratio N1/N2 would be (g1/g2) multiplied by exp(\u0394E/(k T)).\n\nBut for T=6000 K, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(16.58). For T=5500 K, it's (g1/g2) * exp(18.06). So the ratio would be (exp(18.06)/exp(16.58)) = exp(1.48) \u2248 4.38.\n\nWait, but that would mean that N1/N2 is higher when T is lower, which contradicts the problem statement. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So according to this, the ratio increases when T decreases, which contradicts the observation.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is considering the inverse ratio, N2/N1. Let me think.\n\nIf the ratio is N2/N1, then the ratio would be (g2/g1) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo, for T1=6000 K:\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -16.58 )\n\nSimilarly, for T2=5500 K:\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -18.06 )\n\nSo, the ratio at T1 is much larger than at T2. Because exp(-16.58) is about 2.7e-7, and exp(-18.06) is about 1.4e-8.\n\nSo, the ratio N2/N1 is higher when T is higher, and lower when T is lower. So if the problem observes that N1/N2 decreases when spots are present (T is lower), that would imply that N2/N1 increases when T is lower, which is not the case. Wait, no, if N1/N2 decreases, then N2/N1 increases.\n\nWait, let me think. If N1/N2 decreases, then N2/N1 increases.\n\nSo, when the star has spots (lower T), N1/N2 is lower. So, N2/N1 is higher.\n\nBut according to the calculation, N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nAt T=6000 K, exp(-16.58) = 2.7e-7.\n\nAt T=5500 K, exp(-18.06)=1.4e-8.\n\nSo N2/N1 is lower at T=5500 K than at T=6000 K.\n\nWait, no, 1.4e-8 is smaller than 2.7e-7, so N2/N1 is lower when T is lower.\n\nBut the problem says that when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower, which implies N2/N1 is higher. So that's a contradiction.\n\nI'm getting really stuck here. Maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the problem is not about the ratio of N1 to N2, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the ratios. Let me denote the ratio R = N1/N2.\n\nWithout spots, R1 = (g1/g2) * exp(\u0394E/(k T1) )\n\nWith spots, R2 = (g1/g2) * exp(\u0394E/(k T2) )\n\nSo the factor by which R changes is R1/R2 = exp(\u0394E/(k T1) - \u0394E/(k T2) )\n\n= exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\u0394E = 8.57 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nk = 1.38e-23 J/K.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) \u2248 9.955e4 K.\n\nSo,\n\n(1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 *5500) )\n\n= (-500) / (33,000,000) ) = -5e2 / 3.3e7 = approx -1.515e-5.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) = 9.955e4 K * (-1.515e-5) \u2248 -1.506.\n\nSo,\n\nR1/R2 = exp(-1.506) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo, the ratio R1/R2 is about 0.221, which is less than 1. So the ratio without spots is 0.221 times the ratio with spots. That would mean that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which matches the problem statement.\n\nWait, but according to this, R1 = N1/N2 without spots, R2 = N1/N2 with spots. So R1/R2 is the factor by which the ratio changes. So if R1/R2 is 0.221, that would mean that without spots, the ratio is 0.221 times the ratio when there are spots. So the ratio is smaller without spots, which contradicts the problem statement which says the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\n\nWait, no, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So R2 < R1.\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, R1/R2 = 0.221, which is less than 1, implying R1 < R2. That's the opposite of what the problem states.\n\nHmm, this is getting too confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the sign. Let me compute (1/T1 - 1/T2).\n\nT1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\n1/T1 = 1/6000 \u2248 1.6667e-4.\n\n1/T2 = 1/5500 \u2248 1.8182e-4.\n\nSo,\n\n1/T1 - 1/T2 = 1.6667e-4 - 1.8182e-4 = -1.515e-5.\n\nSo, the exponent is \u0394E/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) = 9.955e4 * (-1.515e-5) \u2248 -1.506.\n\nSo exp(-1.506) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo R1/R2 = 0.221.\n\nWhich implies R1 = 0.221 * R2.\n\nSo R1 < R2. Which means that without spots, the ratio is lower than when there are spots. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases, meaning R2 < R1.\n\nSo this suggests that my calculation is wrong, or perhaps I've misapplied the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is N2/N1. Let me compute that.\n\nIf R = N2/N1, then R1/R2 = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBecause R = (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( (-\u0394E/(k T1)) - (-\u0394E/(k T2)) ) )\n\n= exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )\n\nWhich is exp( \u0394E/(k) ( - (1/T1 -1/T2) ) )\n\nWhich is exp( - (\u0394E/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) ) )\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) = 9.955e4 * (-1.515e-5) \u2248 -1.506.\n\nSo,\n\nR1/R2 = exp( 1.506 ) \u2248 4.50.\n\nSo, the factor by which R changes is about 4.5. So R1 = 4.5 * R2.\n\nWhich would mean that without spots, the ratio R = N2/N1 is higher than when there are spots. So when the star has spots, R decreases, which matches the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem states that the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So if R = N2/N1, then R increases when the star has spots, which would mean that N1/N2 decreases.\n\nWait, no, R = N2/N1. If R increases, then N2/N1 increases, so N1/N2 decreases.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the problem says N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So R = N2/N1 increases, so R1/R2 = 4.5. So the factor is 4.5.\n\nSo the factor by which the ratio changes (R1/R2) is 4.5.\n\nSo looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, \\( N_1/N_2 \\), using the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K.\n\nThe main part of the question involves the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.\n\nThe transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range, I think. And the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the usual equations for LTE apply.\n\nHmm. So, I remember that the ratio of populations of two energy levels in LTE is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWait, but in this case, the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower (5500 K), and the ratio n1/n2 (if level 1 is lower energy than level 2) would decrease because the exponential term would be smaller.\n\nWait no, let's clarify. If the transition is between level 1 and level 2, with wavelength 1448 \u00c5, which is ionizing? I'm not sure. But for the ratio, let's say level 2 is higher energy than level 1. So n2 is the number in level 2, n1 in level 1. The ratio n2/n1 would be proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(kT) ), where \u0394E is E2 - E1.\n\nSo when the temperature is lower, the exponential factor becomes smaller, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, the ratio of n1/n2 would increase because that's the inverse.\n\nWait, wait. Let me get this right. Suppose the ratio is n1/n2. Since n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(kT) ), then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( \u0394E/(kT) ). So if the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes a smaller value, so n1/n2 increases. Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots (lower Teff), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Hmm, that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, no, the question says when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So maybe I had the levels wrong. Maybe level 1 is higher than level 2. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the transition from level 1 to level 2 emits a photon of wavelength 1448 \u00c5. So the energy difference \u0394E = hc/(\u03bb). Let's compute that. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, c is 3e8 m/s. \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1.448e-7 meters.\n\n\u0394E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) \u2248 1.373e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut wait, that's per photon. To get the energy difference per atom, it's the same. But for the Boltzmann factor, we can compute \u0394E/(kT), where k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38e-23 J/K) and T is the temperature.\n\nSo, for the two cases: when T is 6000 K and when it's 5500 K.\n\nLet me compute (\u0394E)/(k*T) for both cases.\n\nFirst, T1 = 6000 K. T2 =5500 K.\n\nCompute for each:\n\nCase 1: T1=6000 K.\n\n\u0394E/(k*T1) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K) )\n\nCalculating denominator: 1.38e-23 *6e3 = 8.28e-20.\n\nSo \u0394E/(k*T1) \u2248 1.373e-18 /8.28e-20 \u2248 16.58.\n\nSimilarly for T2=5500 K.\n\n\u0394E/(k*T2) = 1.373e-18 / (1.38e-23 *5500 )\n\nDenominator: 1.38e-23 *5.5e3 = 7.59e-20.\n\nSo 1.373e-18 /7.59e-20 \u2248 18.08.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, but that can't be. Because 1.373e-18 / 7.59e-20 is about 18.08.\n\nWait, but that would imply that the exponent is positive and larger. So the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp(\u0394E/(kT)), which would be exp(16.58) and exp(18.08) when T is 6000 and 5500 K, respectively.\n\nWait, but those exponents are huge, which would make the ratios (n1/n2) extremely large. But wait, that doesn't make sense because such a high ratio would imply almost all atoms are in the lower energy level. But the problem says that when the temperature is lower, the ratio decreases. Hmm, maybe I got the levels reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon. So level 2 is higher energy than level 1. So n2 is higher than n1. The ratio n2/n1 would be proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(kT) ). So when T decreases, the exponential term decreases, so n2/n1 decreases, meaning more in level 1, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. That contradicts what I just thought.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the energy calculation. Let me recheck the wavelength and the energy.\n\nWait, 1448 \u00c5 is about 0.1448 microns, which is in the near UV. So the energy is higher than visible light. For example, visible light is around 400-700 nm (4000-7000 \u00c5), so 1448 \u00c5 is about 0.1448 microns, so higher energy. So the transition requires higher energy, so \u0394E is positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the energy difference more accurately.\n\nCompute \u0394E in terms of eV for easier handling. Because 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J.\n\nSo, hc = 12400 eV\u00b7\u00c5 (approximately). So, hc/\u03bb = 12400 / 1448 \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E is about 8.56 eV. So that's per photon. So for each atom, the energy difference is 8.56 eV.\n\nWait, that's a big energy difference. So at higher temperatures, the probability of being in the higher energy level is higher.\n\nBut let's think about the Boltzmann factor.\n\nThe ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(kT) )\n\nBut for such a high \u0394E, even at 6000 K, the exponent is going to be a big negative number. Let me compute it.\n\n\u0394E/(kT) in eV/(eV/K * T) is (\u0394E in eV) / ( (k in eV/K) * T )\n\nk is 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo, for T=6000 K:\n\n\u0394E/(k*T) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K )\n\n= 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *6e3 )\n\n= 8.56 / (0.517) \u2248 16.56.\n\nSimilarly, for T=5500 K:\n\n\u0394E/(k*T) =8.56/(8.617e-5 *5500 )\n\n=8.56/(0.4739)\u224818.07.\n\nSo, the exponent is about 16.56 for T=6000 K and 18.07 for T=5500 K.\n\nSo, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -16.56 ) and exp( -18.07 ), respectively.\n\nBut exp(-16.56) is a very small number, like approximately 1.2e-7.\n\nSimilarly, exp(-18.07) is about 2.5e-8.\n\nSo, when the temperature decreases, the ratio n2/n1 becomes even smaller, because the exponent becomes more negative. So, n2/n1 decreases, meaning n1/n2 increases. But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that's the opposite of what we're getting.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So perhaps the levels are in reverse. Maybe level 1 is higher than level 2. Because then, the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which would mean the photon emitted has energy \u0394E = E1 - E2.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, let's correct that.\n\nSo, if level 1 is higher in energy than level 2, then \u0394E = E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV. Then, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( \u0394E/(kT) )\n\nWait, no. The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) )\n\nIf E1 > E2, then E2 - E1 is negative, so -(E2-E1) is positive. So, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(kT) )\n\nBut in this case, n1 is the higher energy level. So, for a higher temperature, more atoms would be in the higher energy level (n1), so n1/n2 would be higher.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So if the temperature is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower, meaning more atoms are in the lower level (n2), which makes sense because at lower T, the fraction in higher energy levels is less.\n\nWait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, the exponent (\u0394E/(kT)) becomes larger, so exp(\u0394E/(kT)) increases, which would make n1/n2 larger. But the problem says it's smaller when T is lower. So that's a contradiction.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting the ratio backwards. Let me re-express the ratio correctly.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLevel 1: higher energy (E1)\nLevel 2: lower energy (E2)\n\nSo, E1 > E2.\n\nThe transition from level 1 to level 2 emits a photon of energy \u0394E = E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV.\n\nThe ratio of the populations is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) )^{-1} ?\n\nWait, no. Let's get the correct expression.\n\nThe Boltzmann factor for the ratio n_j/n_i is (g_j/g_i) exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(kT) )\n\nSo, if we have n1 and n2, with E1 > E2, then:\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(kT) )\n\nBecause E_j is E1 and E_i is E2.\n\nSo, E1 - E2 is positive, so the exponent is negative. So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(kT) )\n\nSo, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-\u0394E/(kT)) increases, which would make n1/n2 larger.\n\nWait, but if T decreases, exp(-\u0394E/(kT)) decreases, so n1/n2 decreases. Which matches the problem statement: when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases.\n\nYes, that makes sense now.\n\nSo, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(kT) )\n\nWe can ignore the statistical weights if they are the same for both levels, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume g1 = g2. Or maybe the question doesn't require us to consider them because they might cancel out when taking the ratio of ratios.\n\nSo, the ratio of n1/n2 when there are no spots (T1=6000 K) to when there are spots (T2=5500 K) is:\n\nRatio = [exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute that.\n\nLet me compute (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )\n\nWe have \u0394E=8.56 eV, k=8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nCompute (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )\n\nFirst, 8.56 / 8.617e-5 = approximately 8.56 / 0.00008617 \u2248 99327 K.\n\nWait, because 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617, so 8.56 / 0.00008617 \u2248 99327.\n\nThen, 1/6000 \u2248 0.00016667, 1/5500 \u2248 0.00018182.\n\nThe difference is (0.00018182 - 0.00016667) = 0.00001515.\n\nMultiply that by 99327 K:\n\n99327 * 0.00001515 \u2248 1.505.\n\nSo, the exponent is about 1.505.\n\nSo, the ratio is exp(1.505) \u2248 e^1.505.\n\nCalculating e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.505 is a bit more, maybe about 4.5.\n\nWait, e^1.505 \u2248 4.505.\n\nSo the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = e^{1.505} \u2248 4.5.\n\nSo, the factor is about 4.5, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the math.\n\nCompute 1/T1 - 1/T2:\n\n1/6000 = 0.0001666667\n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.0001818182\n\nDifference: 0.0001818182 - 0.0001666667 = 0.0000151515\n\nMultiply by (\u0394E/(k)):\n\n\u0394E/(k) = 8.56 / 8.617e-5 = let's compute more accurately.\n\n8.56 / 0.00008617 \u2248 8.56 / 0.00008617.\n\nWell, 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617.\n\n8.56 / 0.00008617 = 8.56 / 8.617e-5.\n\nLet me compute 8.56 / 0.00008617.\n\nCompute 8.56 / 0.00008617 \u2248 8.56 / 8.617e-5 = 8.56 / (8.617 * 1e-5) ) = (8.56 / 8.617) * 1e5 \u2248 (0.993) * 1e5 \u2248 99300.\n\nSo, 99300 * 0.0000151515 = ?\n\nCompute 99300 * 0.0000151515.\n\n0.0000151515 is approximately 1.51515e-5.\n\nSo, 99300 * 1.51515e-5 = (99300 * 1.51515 ) * 1e-5.\n\nCompute 99300 * 1.51515:\n\nWell, 100,000 * 1.51515 = 151,515. So 99300 is 700 less than 100,000. So 99300 *1.51515 = 151,515 - (700 * 1.51515 )\n\n700 *1.51515 = 1060.605.\n\nSo, 151,515 - 1,060.605 \u2248 150,454.395.\n\nMultiply by 1e-5: 150,454.395 * 1e-5 = 15.0454.\n\nWait, wait a second. That's not right because 99300 * 1.51515e-5 is 99300 * 1.51515 * 1e-5.\n\nWait, 99300 * 1.51515e-5 = 99300 * (1.51515 *1e-5) )\n\nWhich is 99300 * 0.0000151515.\n\nWhich is (99300 * 0.0000151515 ) = (99300 * 1.51515e-5 ) \n\nLet me compute 99300 * 1.51515e-5.\n\nAlternatively, 99300 * 0.0000151515 = 99300 * 1.51515e-5 = \n\n= (99300 *1.51515 ) *1e-5.\n\nCompute 99300 * 1.51515.\n\nWell, 99300 is approximately 1e5 - 700. So, 99300 *1.51515 = 1e5 *1.51515 -700 *1.51515.\n\nWhich is 151515 - (700 *1.51515 )\n\n700 *1.51515 = 1060.605.\n\nSo 151515 - 1060.605 = 150454.395.\n\nMultiply by 1e-5: 150454.395 *1e-5 = 15.0454.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the exponent earlier was around 1.5. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation when I did it the first time. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, \u0394E/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) = 8.56 / 8.617e-5 = approx 99327 K.\n\nThen, (1/T1 - 1/T2 ) = (1/6000 - 1/5500 ) = (5500 -6000 )/(6000 *5500 ) )= (-500)/(33,000,000 )= -500/(3.3e7 )= -0.0000151515.\n\nWait, wait, wait. I think I made a mistake in the sign earlier. Because T2 is lower than T1, so 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1. So, 1/6000 is 0.0001666667, 1/5500 is 0.0001818182. So, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.0000151515.\n\nWait, but in the equation, it's (1/T1 -1/T2 ) = (0.000166667 - 0.000181818) = -0.0000151515.\n\nSo, (\u0394E/k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2 ) = (99327 K) * ( -0.0000151515 ) = -1.505.\n\nSo, the exponent is -1.505.\n\nWait, wait, but earlier when I thought it was positive, I got about 1.5, but now the calculation is negative.\n\nWait, let's re-express the ratio.\n\nThe ratio is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( (8.56 eV / 8.617e-5 eV/K ) * (1/6000 -1/5500 ) )\n\nSo, 1/6000 -1/5500 = (5500-6000)/(6000*5500 )= (-500)/(33,000,000 )= -1/(66,000 )\n\nSo, the product is:\n\n(8.56 /8.617e-5 ) * (-1/66,000 )\n\nWhich is approximately (99327) * (-1.51515e-5 )\n\n= 99327 * (-0.0000151515 ) \u2248 -1.505.\n\nSo, the exponent is -1.505.\n\nSo, the ratio is exp( -1.505 ) \u2248 e^-1.505 \u2248 0.221.\n\nWait, that's the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.221.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots.\n\nSo, the ratio (no spots / spots) would be greater than 1, because the numerator is larger. So if the calculation gives 0.221, that would imply that (no spots) is 0.221 times (spots), which would mean that when there are no spots, the ratio is lower, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the exponent.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nThe ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\n= exp( (8.56 eV /8.617e-5 eV/K ) * (1/6000 -1/5500) )\n\nWe computed (1/6000 -1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33e6 )= -0.0000151515.\n\nSo, the exponent is (99327 K) * (-0.0000151515 )= -1.505.\n\nSo, the ratio is exp(-1.505) \u2248 0.221.\n\nWhich would mean that (n1/n2)_no_spots is 0.221 times (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots.\n\nSo, (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.221 implies (n1/n2)_no_spots = 0.221 * (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nWhich would imply (n1/n2)_spots = (n1/n2)_no_spots / 0.221 \u2248 4.53 times higher.\n\nWhich would mean that when spots are present, (n1/n2) is higher, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states: \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.\"\n\nSo, the ratio is (n1/n2)_no_spots > (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nSo, the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots is greater than 1.\n\nBut according to the calculation, it's about 0.221, which is less than 1. So something's wrong.\n\nAh, perhaps I mixed up the levels. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon. So level 2 is higher than level 1.\n\nSo, in that case, E2 > E1.\n\nSo, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) )\n\nSo, when T is lower, exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ) becomes smaller, so n2/n1 decreases. So, n1/n2 increases.\n\nBut the problem says when there are spots (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe ratio (n1/n2) when no spots (T1) to when spots (T2) is:\n\nRatio = [n1/n2 at T1 ] / [n1/n2 at T2 ]\n\nBut n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(kT) )\n\nAssuming g1 = g2, which I think is a fair assumption unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, Ratio = [ exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T2) ) ]\n\n= exp( (E1 - E2)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) )\n\n= exp( (\u0394E)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) )\n\nSo, compute this:\n\n(\u0394E)/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K ) \u2248 99327 K.\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1/5500 - 1/6000 ) = (6000 -5500 )/(5500 *6000 ) = 500/(33,000,000 )= 1/(66,000 ) \u2248 1.515e-5.\n\nSo, (\u0394E)/(k) * (1/T2 -1/T1 ) = 99327 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 1.505.\n\nSo, Ratio = exp(1.505 ) \u2248 4.5.\n\nSo, the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 4.5.\n\nWhich means when there are no spots, the ratio is 4.5 times higher than when there are spots. So, the factor is 4.5, which is option C.\n\nSo, the answer should be option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K.\n\nThe main part of the question involves the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.\n\nThe transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range, I think. And the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the usual equations for LTE apply.\n\nHmm. So, I remember that the ratio of populations of two energy levels in LTE is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWait, but in this case, the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower (5500 K), and the ratio n1/n2 (if level 1 is lower energy than level 2) would decrease because the exponential term would be smaller.\n\nWait no, let's clarify. If the transition is between level 1 and level 2, with wavelength 1448 \u00c5, which is ionizing? I'm not sure. But for the ratio, let's say level 2 is higher energy than level 1. So n2 is the number in level 2, n1 in level 1. The ratio n2/n1 would be proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(kT) ), where \u0394E is E2 - E1.\n\nSo when the temperature is lower, the exponential factor becomes smaller, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, the ratio of n1/n2 would increase because that's the inverse.\n\nWait, wait. Let me get this right. Suppose the ratio is n1/n2. Since n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(kT) ), then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( \u0394E/(kT) ). So if the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes a smaller value, so n1/n2 increases. Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots (lower Teff), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Hmm, that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, no, the question says when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So maybe I had the levels wrong. Maybe level 1 is higher than level 2. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the transition from level 1 to level 2 emits a photon of wavelength 1448 \u00c5. So the energy difference \u0394E = hc/(\u03bb). Let's compute that. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, c is 3e8 m/s. \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1.448e-7 meters.\n\n\u0394E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) \u2248 1.373e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut wait, that's per photon. To get the energy difference per atom, it's the same. But for the Boltzmann factor, we can compute \u0394E/(kT), where k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38e-23 J/K) and T is the temperature.\n\nSo, for the two cases: when T is 6000 K and when it's 5500 K.\n\nLet me compute (\u0394E)/(k*T) for both cases.\n\nFirst, T1 = 6000 K. T2 =5500 K.\n\nCompute for each:\n\nCase 1: T1=6000 K.\n\n\u0394E/(k*T1) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K) )\n\nCalculating denominator: 1.38e-23 *6e3 = 8.28e-20.\n\nSo \u0394E/(k*T1) \u2248 1.373e-18 /8.28e-20 \u2248 16.58.\n\nSimilarly for T2=5500 K.\n\n\u0394E/(k*T2) = 1.373e-18 / (1.38e-23 *5500 )\n\nDenominator: 1.38e-23 *5.5e3 = 7.59e-20.\n\nSo 1.373e-18 /7.59e-20 \u2248 18.08.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, but that can't be. Because 1.373e-18 / 7.59e-20 is about 18.08.\n\nWait, but that would imply that the exponent is positive and larger. So the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp(\u0394E/(kT)), which would be exp(16.58) and exp(18.08) when T is 6000 and 5500 K, respectively.\n\nWait, but those exponents are huge, which would make the ratios (n1/n2) extremely large. But wait, that doesn't make sense because such a high ratio would imply almost all atoms are in the lower energy level. But the problem says that when the temperature is lower, the ratio decreases. Hmm, maybe I got the levels reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon. So level 2 is higher energy than level 1. So n2 is higher than n1. The ratio n2/n1 would be proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(kT) ). So when T decreases, the exponential term decreases, so n2/n1 decreases, meaning more in level 1, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. That contradicts what I just thought.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the energy calculation. Let me recheck the wavelength and the energy.\n\nWait, 1448 \u00c5 is about 0.1448 microns, which is in the near UV. So the energy is higher than visible light. For example, visible light is around 400-700 nm (4000-7000 \u00c5), so 1448 \u00c5 is about 0.1448 microns, so higher energy. So the transition requires higher energy, so \u0394E is positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the energy difference more accurately.\n\nCompute \u0394E in terms of eV for easier handling. Because 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J.\n\nSo, hc = 12400 eV\u00b7\u00c5 (approximately). So, hc/\u03bb = 12400 / 1448 \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E is about 8.56 eV. So that's per photon. So for each atom, the energy difference is 8.56 eV.\n\nWait, that's a big energy difference. So at higher temperatures, the probability of being in the higher energy level is higher.\n\nBut let's think about the Boltzmann factor.\n\nThe ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(kT) )\n\nBut for such a high \u0394E, even at 6000 K, the exponent is going to be a big negative number. Let me compute it.\n\n\u0394E/(kT) in eV/(eV/K * T) is (\u0394E in eV) / ( (k in eV/K) * T )\n\nk is 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo, for T=6000 K:\n\n\u0394E/(k*T) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K )\n\n= 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *6e3 )\n\n= 8.56 / (0.517) \u2248 16.56.\n\nSimilarly, for T=5500 K:\n\n\u0394E/(k*T) =8.56/(8.617e-5 *5500 )\n\n=8.56/(0.4739)\u224818.07.\n\nSo, the exponent is about 16.56 for T=6000 K and 18.07 for T=5500 K.\n\nSo, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -16.56 ) and exp( -18.07 ), respectively.\n\nBut exp(-16.56) is a very small number, like approximately 1.2e-7.\n\nSimilarly, exp(-18.07) is about 2.5e-8.\n\nSo, when the temperature decreases, the ratio n2/n1 becomes even smaller, because the exponent becomes more negative. So, n2/n1 decreases, meaning n1/n2 increases. But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that's the opposite of what we're getting.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So perhaps the levels are in reverse. Maybe level 1 is higher than level 2. Because then, the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which would mean the photon emitted has energy \u0394E = E1 - E2.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, let's correct that.\n\nSo, if level 1 is higher in energy than level 2, then \u0394E = E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV. Then, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( \u0394E/(kT) )\n\nWait, no. The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) )\n\nIf E1 > E2, then E2 - E1 is negative, so -(E2-E1) is positive. So, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(kT) )\n\nBut in this case, n1 is the higher energy level. So, for a higher temperature, more atoms would be in the higher energy level (n1), so n1/n2 would be higher.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So if the temperature is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower, meaning more atoms are in the lower level (n2), which makes sense because at lower T, the fraction in higher energy levels is less.\n\nWait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, the exponent (\u0394E/(kT)) becomes larger, so exp(\u0394E/(kT)) increases, which would make n1/n2 larger. But the problem says it's smaller when T is lower. So that's a contradiction.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting the ratio backwards. Let me re-express the ratio correctly.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLevel 1: higher energy (E1)\nLevel 2: lower energy (E2)\n\nSo, E1 > E2.\n\nThe transition from level 1 to level 2 emits a photon of energy \u0394E = E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV.\n\nThe ratio of the populations is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) )^{-1} ?\n\nWait, no. Let's get the correct expression.\n\nThe Boltzmann factor for the ratio n_j/n_i is (g_j/g_i) exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(kT) )\n\nSo, if we have n1 and n2, with E1 > E2, then:\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(kT) )\n\nBecause E_j is E1 and E_i is E2.\n\nSo, E1 - E2 is positive, so the exponent is negative. So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(kT) )\n\nSo, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-\u0394E/(kT)) increases, which would make n1/n2 larger.\n\nWait, but if T decreases, exp(-\u0394E/(kT)) decreases, so n1/n2 decreases. Which matches the problem statement: when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases.\n\nYes, that makes sense now.\n\nSo, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(kT) )\n\nWe can ignore the statistical weights if they are the same for both levels, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume g1 = g2. Or maybe the question doesn't require us to consider them because they might cancel out when taking the ratio of ratios.\n\nSo, the ratio of n1/n2 when there are no spots (T1=6000 K) to when there are spots (T2=5500 K) is:\n\nRatio = [exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute that.\n\nLet me compute (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )\n\nWe have \u0394E=8.56 eV, k=8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nCompute (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )\n\nFirst, 8.56 / 8.617e-5 = approximately 8.56 / 0.00008617 \u2248 99327 K.\n\nWait, because 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617, so 8.56 / 0.00008617 \u2248 99327.\n\nThen, 1/6000 \u2248 0.00016667, 1/5500 \u2248 0.00018182.\n\nThe difference is (0.00018182 - 0.00016667) = 0.00001515.\n\nMultiply that by 99327 K:\n\n99327 * 0.00001515 \u2248 1.505.\n\nSo, the exponent is about 1.505.\n\nSo, the ratio is exp(1.505) \u2248 e^1.505.\n\nCalculating e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.505 is a bit more, maybe about 4.5.\n\nWait, e^1.505 \u2248 4.505.\n\nSo the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = e^{1.505} \u2248 4.5.\n\nSo, the factor is about 4.5, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the math.\n\nCompute 1/T1 - 1/T2:\n\n1/6000 = 0.0001666667\n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.0001818182\n\nDifference: 0.0001818182 - 0.0001666667 = 0.0000151515\n\nMultiply by (\u0394E/(k)):\n\n\u0394E/(k) = 8.56 / 8.617e-5 = let's compute more accurately.\n\n8.56 / 0.00008617 \u2248 8.56 / 0.00008617.\n\nWell, 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617.\n\n8.56 / 0.00008617 = 8.56 / 8.617e-5.\n\nLet me compute 8.56 / 0.00008617.\n\nCompute 8.56 / 0.00008617 \u2248 8.56 / 8.617e-5 = 8.56 / (8.617 * 1e-5) ) = (8.56 / 8.617) * 1e5 \u2248 (0.993) * 1e5 \u2248 99300.\n\nSo, 99300 * 0.0000151515 = ?\n\nCompute 99300 * 0.0000151515.\n\n0.0000151515 is approximately 1.51515e-5.\n\nSo, 99300 * 1.51515e-5 = (99300 * 1.51515 ) * 1e-5.\n\nCompute 99300 * 1.51515:\n\nWell, 100,000 * 1.51515 = 151,515. So 99300 is 700 less than 100,000. So 99300 *1.51515 = 151,515 - (700 * 1.51515 )\n\n700 *1.51515 = 1060.605.\n\nSo, 151,515 - 1,060.605 \u2248 150,454.395.\n\nMultiply by 1e-5: 150,454.395 * 1e-5 = 15.0454.\n\nWait, wait a second. That's not right because 99300 * 1.51515e-5 is 99300 * 1.51515 * 1e-5.\n\nWait, 99300 * 1.51515e-5 = 99300 * (1.51515 *1e-5) )\n\nWhich is 99300 * 0.0000151515.\n\nWhich is (99300 * 0.0000151515 ) = (99300 * 1.51515e-5 ) \n\nLet me compute 99300 * 1.51515e-5.\n\nAlternatively, 99300 * 0.0000151515 = 99300 * 1.51515e-5 = \n\n= (99300 *1.51515 ) *1e-5.\n\nCompute 99300 * 1.51515.\n\nWell, 99300 is approximately 1e5 - 700. So, 99300 *1.51515 = 1e5 *1.51515 -700 *1.51515.\n\nWhich is 151515 - (700 *1.51515 )\n\n700 *1.51515 = 1060.605.\n\nSo 151515 - 1060.605 = 150454.395.\n\nMultiply by 1e-5: 150454.395 *1e-5 = 15.0454.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the exponent earlier was around 1.5. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation when I did it the first time. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, \u0394E/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) = 8.56 / 8.617e-5 = approx 99327 K.\n\nThen, (1/T1 - 1/T2 ) = (1/6000 - 1/5500 ) = (5500 -6000 )/(6000 *5500 ) )= (-500)/(33,000,000 )= -500/(3.3e7 )= -0.0000151515.\n\nWait, wait, wait. I think I made a mistake in the sign earlier. Because T2 is lower than T1, so 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1. So, 1/6000 is 0.0001666667, 1/5500 is 0.0001818182. So, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.0000151515.\n\nWait, but in the equation, it's (1/T1 -1/T2 ) = (0.000166667 - 0.000181818) = -0.0000151515.\n\nSo, (\u0394E/k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2 ) = (99327 K) * ( -0.0000151515 ) = -1.505.\n\nSo, the exponent is -1.505.\n\nWait, wait, but earlier when I thought it was positive, I got about 1.5, but now the calculation is negative.\n\nWait, let's re-express the ratio.\n\nThe ratio is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( (8.56 eV / 8.617e-5 eV/K ) * (1/6000 -1/5500 ) )\n\nSo, 1/6000 -1/5500 = (5500-6000)/(6000*5500 )= (-500)/(33,000,000 )= -1/(66,000 )\n\nSo, the product is:\n\n(8.56 /8.617e-5 ) * (-1/66,000 )\n\nWhich is approximately (99327) * (-1.51515e-5 )\n\n= 99327 * (-0.0000151515 ) \u2248 -1.505.\n\nSo, the exponent is -1.505.\n\nSo, the ratio is exp( -1.505 ) \u2248 e^-1.505 \u2248 0.221.\n\nWait, that's the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.221.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots.\n\nSo, the ratio (no spots / spots) would be greater than 1, because the numerator is larger. So if the calculation gives 0.221, that would imply that (no spots) is 0.221 times (spots), which would mean that when there are no spots, the ratio is lower, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the exponent.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nThe ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\n= exp( (8.56 eV /8.617e-5 eV/K ) * (1/6000 -1/5500) )\n\nWe computed (1/6000 -1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33e6 )= -0.0000151515.\n\nSo, the exponent is (99327 K) * (-0.0000151515 )= -1.505.\n\nSo, the ratio is exp(-1.505) \u2248 0.221.\n\nWhich would mean that (n1/n2)_no_spots is 0.221 times (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots.\n\nSo, (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.221 implies (n1/n2)_no_spots = 0.221 * (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nWhich would imply (n1/n2)_spots = (n1/n2)_no_spots / 0.221 \u2248 4.53 times higher.\n\nWhich would mean that when spots are present, (n1/n2) is higher, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states: \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.\"\n\nSo, the ratio is (n1/n2)_no_spots > (n1/n2)_spots.\n\nSo, the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots is greater than 1.\n\nBut according to the calculation, it's about 0.221, which is less than 1. So something's wrong.\n\nAh, perhaps I mixed up the levels. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon. So level 2 is higher than level 1.\n\nSo, in that case, E2 > E1.\n\nSo, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) )\n\nSo, when T is lower, exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ) becomes smaller, so n2/n1 decreases. So, n1/n2 increases.\n\nBut the problem says when there are spots (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe ratio (n1/n2) when no spots (T1) to when spots (T2) is:\n\nRatio = [n1/n2 at T1 ] / [n1/n2 at T2 ]\n\nBut n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(kT) )\n\nAssuming g1 = g2, which I think is a fair assumption unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, Ratio = [ exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T2) ) ]\n\n= exp( (E1 - E2)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) )\n\n= exp( (\u0394E)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) )\n\nSo, compute this:\n\n(\u0394E)/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K ) \u2248 99327 K.\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1/5500 - 1/6000 ) = (6000 -5500 )/(5500 *6000 ) = 500/(33,000,000 )= 1/(66,000 ) \u2248 1.515e-5.\n\nSo, (\u0394E)/(k) * (1/T2 -1/T1 ) = 99327 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 1.505.\n\nSo, Ratio = exp(1.505 ) \u2248 4.5.\n\nSo, the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 4.5.\n\nWhich means when there are no spots, the ratio is 4.5 times higher than when there are spots. So, the factor is 4.5, which is option C.\n\nSo, the answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation in the context of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are the statistical weights, \\(\\Delta E\\) is the energy difference between the levels, \\(k\\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Energy Difference (\\(\\Delta E\\))**: The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \\(1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, alright, so the question is about a star's effective temperature and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels.\n\nThe star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? I remember that starspots are cooler regions, so when a star has spots, the overall brightness changes. But in this problem, they're talking about the effective temperature decreasing, so that makes sense.\n\nThe main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes\u2014comparing the case without spots to when it has spots.\n\nI think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas in thermal equilibrium. The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.\n\nWait, the ratio is n1/n2 or n2/n1? Because the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, Teff is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. So let's see: when the temperature is lower, how does the population ratio change?\n\nWait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ) ). So if E2 > E1, then the exponent is positive. So as temperature T decreases, the exponential term decreases because (E2-E1)/(kT) is a larger positive number, so exp of that becomes smaller. So n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) times a smaller number. So if g1/g2 is fixed, a lower T would make the ratio n1/n2 smaller.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots (Teff is 5500 K), the observed ratio of n1/n2 decreases compared to when there are no spots (6000 K). So let's think: when T is 6000, what's the ratio, and when T is 5500, how does it change?\n\nWait, the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when Teff is 5500 K, the ratio is lower than when it's 6000 K. So that would imply that at 5500 K, the ratio is lower than at 6000 K. So, the ratio without spots is higher than with.\n\nSo the ratio is n1/n2. So when T increases, the ratio n1/n2 increases? Let me see: because if T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) becomes smaller, so the exponential is larger. So (g1/g2) multiplied by a larger number, so n1/n2 is larger. So higher T would mean higher ratio.\n\nSo without spots (T=6000), the ratio is higher than when there are spots (T=5500). So the ratio decreases when T decreases.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the spots are present, Teff is lower, and ratio is lower. So the factor by which the ratio changes is the ratio of the two cases: without spots divided by with spots. So we need to compute (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the energy levels. The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 \u00c5. So that's in the ultraviolet range. Hmm, but how does that affect the calculation? Maybe not directly, unless we need to find the energy difference between the levels.\n\nWait, the energy difference E2 - E1 can be found using the wavelength. The energy of a photon is E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. So E = hc/(\u03bb). But wait, the energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1 = hc/\u03bb.\n\nWait, but I think the energy levels are such that the transition from level 1 to level 2 emits a photon of wavelength 1448 \u00c5. So if an atom is in level 2, it can drop to level 1 and emit a photon. So E2 - E1 = hc/(lambda).\n\nSo, let me compute E2 - E1. Let me get the constants:\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\nc = 3e8 m/s\nlambda = 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo E = hc/lambda = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) J.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.\n\nWait, but that's per photon. But we can also express this in terms of eV, because Boltzmann's constant is in eV/K units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the energy in terms of eV, because then we can relate it to the thermal energy kT.\n\nSo, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, 1448 \u00c5 is 1.448e-7 meters.\n\nSo E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) = let me compute 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nNow, 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.57 eV. Hmm, that's about 8.57 eV. Okay.\n\nSo E2 - E1 = 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, that's a significant energy difference. So when T is 6000 K, how does the Boltzmann factor look?\n\nLet me compute the exponent term (E2-E1)/(k*T). Let's compute this for both T=6000 K and T=5500 K.\n\nk is Boltzmann's constant: 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo (E2 - E1) is 8.57 eV.\n\nSo for T=6000 K:\n\n(E2-E1)/(k*T) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 6000) \u2248 8.57 / (0.517) \u2248 16.58.\n\nSimilarly, for T=5500 K:\n\n(E2-E1)/(k*T) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 *5500) \u2248 8.57 / (0.4739) \u2248 18.09.\n\nWait, wait a second. Because E2 is higher than E1, the energy difference is positive, so the exponent is positive, and thus the exponential is exp(-16.58) for T=6000, and exp(-18.09) for T=5500.\n\nWait, but the Boltzmann factor in the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) ). Or wait, is it (E1 - E2) in the exponent? Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the Boltzmann distribution is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j) / (k T) ) )\n\nSo, for n1 and n2, if E2 > E1, then E_i is E1 when i=1, E_j = E2 when j=2.\n\nSo n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nWhich is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo yes, the exponent is positive.\n\nSo for T=6000 K:\n\nexp( (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K *6000 K) )\n\nWait, 8.617e-5 eV/K *6000 K = 0.51702 eV.\n\nSo 8.57 eV / 0.51702 eV \u2248 16.58.\n\nSo the exponent is exp(16.58). Wait, that's a huge number. Similarly, for T=5500 K:\n\n8.617e-5 *5500 = 0.473935 eV.\n\n8.57 / 0.473935 \u2248 18.09.\n\nSo the exponents are 16.58 and 18.09.\n\nBut wait, these numbers are in the exponent, and exp(16.58) is a huge number. But let's think about this.\n\nWait, but for the ratio n1/n2, when T is lower, the exponent is larger, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is larger, so n1/n2 is larger. So without spots, the ratio is higher than when there are spots.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when spots are present (T=5500 K), the ratio is lower than without (6000 K). That's consistent with what I found.\n\nBut the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So we need to compute (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.\n\nWhich is [ (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\nThe (g1/g2) terms cancel out, so it's exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) / exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nWait, E2-E1 is 8.57 eV.\n\n1/T1 is 1/6000 = 0.00016667 K^-1.\n\n1/T2 is 1/5500 \u2248 0.00018182 K^-1.\n\nSo 1/T1 -1/T2 = (0.00018182 - 0.00016667) = 0.00001515 K^-1.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * 0.00001515 K^-1.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = approximately 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 99433. So that's (E2-E1)/(k) \u2248 99433 K.\n\nThen multiply by (1/T1 -1/T2) \u2248 0.00001515 K^-1.\n\nSo 99433 * 0.00001515 \u2248 Let's compute:\n\n99433 * 0.00001515 = 99433 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 Let's compute 1e5 * 1.5e-5 is 1.5, but 99433 is approx 1e5.\n\nWait, 99433 * 1.515e-5 = (approx 1e5) * 1.515e-5 = 1.515.\n\nBut more accurately:\n\n99433 * 0.00001515 = 99433 * 0.000015 + 99433 * 0.00000015.\n\n99433 * 0.000015 = 1.491495\n\n99433 * 0.00000015 = 0.01491495\n\nAdding together: approx 1.5064.\n\nSo the exponent is 1.5064.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.5064) \u2248 e^1.5064.\n\nWhat's e^1.5? e is about 2.718. e^1=2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.648, so e^1.5 is 2.718 * 1.648 \u2248 4.48.\n\nWait, but let's compute e^1.5064 accurately.\n\nUsing calculator-like approach:\n\nWe can compute 1.5064:\n\nWe know that ln(4.5) is around 1.504, since ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504. So e^1.504 \u22484.5. So e^1.5064 is a bit higher than 4.5.\n\nWait, let's compute 1.5064:\n\ne^1.5064 = e^(1.504 + 0.0024) \u2248 e^1.504 * e^0.0024.\n\ne^1.504 \u22484.5.\n\ne^0.0024 \u22481 +0.0024 + (0.0024)^2/2 \u22481.002403.\n\nSo 4.5 * 1.002403 \u22484.5108.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.51.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, E2-E1 is 8.57 eV. Correct.\n\nk is 8.617e-5 eV/K. Correct.\n\nThen, (E2-E1)/(k) = 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 99433 K. Correct.\n\nThen, (1/T1 -1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500-6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -500/(3.3e7)= approximately -1.515e-5 K^-1.\n\nWait, wait wait, I think I might have messed up the sign here.\n\nWait, 1/T1 is 1/6000, and 1/T2 is 1/5500. Since 5500 <6000, 1/5500 >1/6000. So (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative. Because 1/6000 is less than 1/5500, so 1/T1 -1/T2 = (1/6000 -1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000)= -1.515e-5.\n\nSo in the previous calculation, I have (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) = 99433 K * (-1.515e-5 K^-1) ) = -1.5064.\n\nWait, wait a second! Oh, I see now. I think I made a mistake in the sign earlier. Because (1/T1 -1/T2) is negative, so the overall exponent becomes negative.\n\nWait, wait, let me re-express the formula.\n\nThe factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) )\n\nWhich is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/6000 -1/5500) = (8.57 / 8.617e-5) ) * ( -1.515e-5 )\n\nSo that's 99433 * (-1.515e-5) = -1.5064.\n\nSo the exponent is -1.5064.\n\nSo the factor is exp(-1.5064) \u2248 1 / exp(1.5064) \u2248 1/4.51 \u2248 0.2217.\n\nWait, but that's the factor of the ratio when going from no spots to spots. Wait, let me think again.\n\nThe ratio without spots is (n1/n2)_6000, and with spots is (n1/n2)_5500. The question is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So it's (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) / exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\n= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\n= exp( (8.57 eV)/(8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\n= exp( 99433 K * (-1.515e-5 K^-1) )\n\n= exp( -1.5064 )\n\nWhich is about 0.2217.\n\nSo the ratio without spots is 0.2217 times the ratio with spots. Or, the ratio with spots is higher than without.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me re-express this.\n\nLet me denote R1 = (n1/n2) at T1 (6000 K)\n\nR2 = (n1/n2) at T2 (5500 K)\n\nWe have R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )\n\nR2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) ( (1/6000 -1/5500) ) )\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5) )\n\n= exp( -1.5064 ) \u2248 0.2217.\n\nSo R1 is 0.2217 times R2. So R1 = 0.2217 * R2.\n\nWhich means that R1 is smaller than R2.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because when T increases, the ratio R1 should increase, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, because when T is higher, the exponential term (E2-E1)/(kT) is smaller, so the exponent is smaller, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is larger, so R = (g1/g2) * exp(...) would be larger.\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, R1 is 0.2217 * R2. So if R2 is larger, then R1 is smaller.\n\nWhich would imply that when T decreases, the ratio R increases. But according to earlier analysis, when T increases, the ratio R (n1/n2) increases.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is:\n\nn_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(kT) )\n\nIn our case, i=1 and j=2.\n\nSo, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\n= (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo for T1=6000 K, R1 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )\n\nFor T2=5500 K, R2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nBut 1/T1 -1/T2 is negative, so (1/T1 -1/T2) = -1.515e-5.\n\nSo the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5) )= -1.5064.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp(-1.5064) \u2248 0.2217.\n\nSo R1 = 0.2217 * R2.\n\nWhich means that when the star doesn't have spots (R1), the ratio is 0.2217 times R2, which is the ratio when the star has spots.\n\nSo R1 is lower than R2. Wait, but this contradicts the earlier analysis.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because if T is higher, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) is smaller, so exp( that ) is larger. So R1 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k *6000) )\n\nWhich is (g1/g2) * exp( a smaller number ) \u2192 larger value.\n\nWait, so R1 is larger than R2. Because T1 is higher than T2.\n\nSo why is the calculation showing R1/R2 = 0.2217, which is less than 1?\n\nHmm, that suggests that R1 is smaller than R2, which would be the opposite of what I thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me re-express R1/R2.\n\nR1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )\n\nBut since 1/T1 < 1/T2 (because T1 > T2), (1/T1 -1/T2) is negative.\n\nSo the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (negative number), which is negative.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( negative ) \u2192 less than 1.\n\nWhich implies R1 < R2.\n\nSo when T increases, R increases, but according to the calculation, R1 is less than R2, which would imply that R increases as T decreases. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the definition of R1 and R2.\n\nWait, R1 is (n1/n2) at T1=6000 K.\n\nR2 is (n1/n2) at T2=5500 K.\n\nIf T increases, n1/n2 increases, so R1 should be larger than R2.\n\nBut according to the calculation, R1/R2 is 0.2217, which is less than 1. So R1 < R2.\n\nThat's a contradiction.\n\nWait, I think the mistake is in the formula. Let me re-express the Boltzmann equation.\n\nn_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(kT) )\n\nIf E_i > E_j, then (E_i - E_j) is positive, so -(E_i - E_j) is negative. So exp(negative) is less than 1.\n\nWait, but in our case, E2 > E1, so E_i (for i=2) is higher than E_j (for j=1). Wait, no, no. Wait, I'm comparing n1 and n2.\n\nWait, if E2 > E1, then for the ratio n1/n2, which is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), because n1 is lower energy.\n\nWait, let's take a simple example. Suppose E2 is higher than E1.\n\nAt higher T, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller (since T is larger), so exp( that ) is larger.\n\nSo n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo if T increases, the ratio n1/n2 increases, assuming g1/g2 is fixed.\n\nSo if T1 > T2, then R1 = (n1/n2)_T1 > R2 = (n1/n2)_T2.\n\nSo in our case, T1=6000 K, R1 is higher than R2.\n\nBut according to the calculation, R1/R2 = 0.2217 <1, which implies R1 < R2. That can't be.\n\nSo where is the mistake?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the calculation of (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) is incorrect.\n\nWait, 1/T1 -1/T2 is negative, so the product is negative.\n\nSo the exponent is negative, so exp(negative) is less than 1. So R1/R2 = exp(negative) \u2192 R1 < R2.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, when T increases, the ratio R should increase. So this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I have a sign error in the formula.\n\nWait, let me re-derive the formula.\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo the ratio is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo for T1=6000 K, it's exp( (E2 - E1)/(k *6000) )\n\nFor T2=5500 K, it's exp( (E2 - E1)/(k *5500) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\n= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5) )\n\nWhich is exp( -1.5064 ) \u22480.2217.\n\nSo R1 = 0.2217 * R2.\n\nWhich implies R1 < R2.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T should lead to higher R, so R1 should be larger than R2.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the ratio backwards.\n\nWait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than without. So R2 (with spots) is lower than R1 (without spots).\n\nBut according to the calculation, R1 = 0.2217 * R2 \u2192 R1 < R2. So this contradicts the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused n1 and n2 in the ratio. Maybe the ratio observed is n2/n1, not n1/n2.\n\nLet me reevaluate.\n\nThe problem says: the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots.\n\nSo when the star has spots, the ratio is lower.\n\nIf the ratio is n1/n2, then when the star has spots (T=5500 K), n1/n2 is lower than when T=6000 K.\n\nWhich would imply that R1 (T=6000) > R2 (T=5500).\n\nSo according to our earlier calculation, R1/R2 = 0.2217 \u2192 R1 = 0.2217 R2 \u2192 R1 < R2.\n\nWhich contradicts the problem statement.\n\nSo perhaps the ratio is n2/n1 instead.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf the ratio is n2/n1, then when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.\n\nSo n2/n1 is higher when T is higher.\n\nLet me compute (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.\n\nWhich is [ (n2/n1) at T=6000 ] / [ (n2/n1) at T=5500 ]\n\n= [ (g2/g1) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T2) ) ]\n\nThe (g2/g1) cancels, so it's exp( (E1-E2)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )\n\n= exp( -(E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )\n\n= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )\n\nWhich is the reciprocal of the previous factor.\n\nSo if R1/R2 (n1/n2) was 0.2217, then (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 = 1/0.2217 \u22484.51.\n\nSo if the ratio observed is n2/n1, then when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Because (n2/n1)_5500 is lower than (n2/n1)_6000.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIf the ratio observed is n2/n1, then when T increases, the ratio increases.\n\nSo when T=6000, n2/n1 is higher than when T=5500. So (n2/n1)_6000 > (n2/n1)_5500.\n\nWhich is the case if the factor (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 is greater than 1.\n\nWhich is indeed 4.51.\n\nSo the factor by which the ratio changes is 4.51, meaning that without spots, the ratio is 4.51 times higher than when it has spots.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5.\n\nSo the answer should be C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, alright, so the question is about a star's effective temperature and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels.\n\nThe star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? I remember that starspots are cooler regions, so when a star has spots, the overall brightness changes. But in this problem, they're talking about the effective temperature decreasing, so that makes sense.\n\nThe main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes\u2014comparing the case without spots to when it has spots.\n\nI think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas in thermal equilibrium. The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.\n\nWait, the ratio is n1/n2 or n2/n1? Because the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, Teff is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. So let's see: when the temperature is lower, how does the population ratio change?\n\nWait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ) ). So if E2 > E1, then the exponent is positive. So as temperature T decreases, the exponential term decreases because (E2-E1)/(kT) is a larger positive number, so exp of that becomes smaller. So n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) times a smaller number. So if g1/g2 is fixed, a lower T would make the ratio n1/n2 smaller.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots (Teff is 5500 K), the observed ratio of n1/n2 decreases compared to when there are no spots (6000 K). So let's think: when T is 6000, what's the ratio, and when T is 5500, how does it change?\n\nWait, the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when Teff is 5500 K, the ratio is lower than when it's 6000 K. So that would imply that at 5500 K, the ratio is lower than at 6000 K. So, the ratio without spots is higher than with.\n\nSo the ratio is n1/n2. So when T increases, the ratio n1/n2 increases? Let me see: because if T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) becomes smaller, so the exponential is larger. So (g1/g2) multiplied by a larger number, so n1/n2 is larger. So higher T would mean higher ratio.\n\nSo without spots (T=6000), the ratio is higher than when there are spots (T=5500). So the ratio decreases when T decreases.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the spots are present, Teff is lower, and ratio is lower. So the factor by which the ratio changes is the ratio of the two cases: without spots divided by with spots. So we need to compute (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the energy levels. The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 \u00c5. So that's in the ultraviolet range. Hmm, but how does that affect the calculation? Maybe not directly, unless we need to find the energy difference between the levels.\n\nWait, the energy difference E2 - E1 can be found using the wavelength. The energy of a photon is E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. So E = hc/(\u03bb). But wait, the energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1 = hc/\u03bb.\n\nWait, but I think the energy levels are such that the transition from level 1 to level 2 emits a photon of wavelength 1448 \u00c5. So if an atom is in level 2, it can drop to level 1 and emit a photon. So E2 - E1 = hc/(lambda).\n\nSo, let me compute E2 - E1. Let me get the constants:\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\nc = 3e8 m/s\nlambda = 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo E = hc/lambda = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) J.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.\n\nWait, but that's per photon. But we can also express this in terms of eV, because Boltzmann's constant is in eV/K units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the energy in terms of eV, because then we can relate it to the thermal energy kT.\n\nSo, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, 1448 \u00c5 is 1.448e-7 meters.\n\nSo E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) = let me compute 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nNow, 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.57 eV. Hmm, that's about 8.57 eV. Okay.\n\nSo E2 - E1 = 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, that's a significant energy difference. So when T is 6000 K, how does the Boltzmann factor look?\n\nLet me compute the exponent term (E2-E1)/(k*T). Let's compute this for both T=6000 K and T=5500 K.\n\nk is Boltzmann's constant: 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo (E2 - E1) is 8.57 eV.\n\nSo for T=6000 K:\n\n(E2-E1)/(k*T) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 6000) \u2248 8.57 / (0.517) \u2248 16.58.\n\nSimilarly, for T=5500 K:\n\n(E2-E1)/(k*T) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 *5500) \u2248 8.57 / (0.4739) \u2248 18.09.\n\nWait, wait a second. Because E2 is higher than E1, the energy difference is positive, so the exponent is positive, and thus the exponential is exp(-16.58) for T=6000, and exp(-18.09) for T=5500.\n\nWait, but the Boltzmann factor in the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) ). Or wait, is it (E1 - E2) in the exponent? Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the Boltzmann distribution is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j) / (k T) ) )\n\nSo, for n1 and n2, if E2 > E1, then E_i is E1 when i=1, E_j = E2 when j=2.\n\nSo n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nWhich is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo yes, the exponent is positive.\n\nSo for T=6000 K:\n\nexp( (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K *6000 K) )\n\nWait, 8.617e-5 eV/K *6000 K = 0.51702 eV.\n\nSo 8.57 eV / 0.51702 eV \u2248 16.58.\n\nSo the exponent is exp(16.58). Wait, that's a huge number. Similarly, for T=5500 K:\n\n8.617e-5 *5500 = 0.473935 eV.\n\n8.57 / 0.473935 \u2248 18.09.\n\nSo the exponents are 16.58 and 18.09.\n\nBut wait, these numbers are in the exponent, and exp(16.58) is a huge number. But let's think about this.\n\nWait, but for the ratio n1/n2, when T is lower, the exponent is larger, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is larger, so n1/n2 is larger. So without spots, the ratio is higher than when there are spots.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when spots are present (T=5500 K), the ratio is lower than without (6000 K). That's consistent with what I found.\n\nBut the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So we need to compute (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.\n\nWhich is [ (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\nThe (g1/g2) terms cancel out, so it's exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) / exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nWait, E2-E1 is 8.57 eV.\n\n1/T1 is 1/6000 = 0.00016667 K^-1.\n\n1/T2 is 1/5500 \u2248 0.00018182 K^-1.\n\nSo 1/T1 -1/T2 = (0.00018182 - 0.00016667) = 0.00001515 K^-1.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * 0.00001515 K^-1.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = approximately 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 99433. So that's (E2-E1)/(k) \u2248 99433 K.\n\nThen multiply by (1/T1 -1/T2) \u2248 0.00001515 K^-1.\n\nSo 99433 * 0.00001515 \u2248 Let's compute:\n\n99433 * 0.00001515 = 99433 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 Let's compute 1e5 * 1.5e-5 is 1.5, but 99433 is approx 1e5.\n\nWait, 99433 * 1.515e-5 = (approx 1e5) * 1.515e-5 = 1.515.\n\nBut more accurately:\n\n99433 * 0.00001515 = 99433 * 0.000015 + 99433 * 0.00000015.\n\n99433 * 0.000015 = 1.491495\n\n99433 * 0.00000015 = 0.01491495\n\nAdding together: approx 1.5064.\n\nSo the exponent is 1.5064.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.5064) \u2248 e^1.5064.\n\nWhat's e^1.5? e is about 2.718. e^1=2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.648, so e^1.5 is 2.718 * 1.648 \u2248 4.48.\n\nWait, but let's compute e^1.5064 accurately.\n\nUsing calculator-like approach:\n\nWe can compute 1.5064:\n\nWe know that ln(4.5) is around 1.504, since ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504. So e^1.504 \u22484.5. So e^1.5064 is a bit higher than 4.5.\n\nWait, let's compute 1.5064:\n\ne^1.5064 = e^(1.504 + 0.0024) \u2248 e^1.504 * e^0.0024.\n\ne^1.504 \u22484.5.\n\ne^0.0024 \u22481 +0.0024 + (0.0024)^2/2 \u22481.002403.\n\nSo 4.5 * 1.002403 \u22484.5108.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.51.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, E2-E1 is 8.57 eV. Correct.\n\nk is 8.617e-5 eV/K. Correct.\n\nThen, (E2-E1)/(k) = 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 99433 K. Correct.\n\nThen, (1/T1 -1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500-6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -500/(3.3e7)= approximately -1.515e-5 K^-1.\n\nWait, wait wait, I think I might have messed up the sign here.\n\nWait, 1/T1 is 1/6000, and 1/T2 is 1/5500. Since 5500 <6000, 1/5500 >1/6000. So (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative. Because 1/6000 is less than 1/5500, so 1/T1 -1/T2 = (1/6000 -1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000)= -1.515e-5.\n\nSo in the previous calculation, I have (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) = 99433 K * (-1.515e-5 K^-1) ) = -1.5064.\n\nWait, wait a second! Oh, I see now. I think I made a mistake in the sign earlier. Because (1/T1 -1/T2) is negative, so the overall exponent becomes negative.\n\nWait, wait, let me re-express the formula.\n\nThe factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) )\n\nWhich is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/6000 -1/5500) = (8.57 / 8.617e-5) ) * ( -1.515e-5 )\n\nSo that's 99433 * (-1.515e-5) = -1.5064.\n\nSo the exponent is -1.5064.\n\nSo the factor is exp(-1.5064) \u2248 1 / exp(1.5064) \u2248 1/4.51 \u2248 0.2217.\n\nWait, but that's the factor of the ratio when going from no spots to spots. Wait, let me think again.\n\nThe ratio without spots is (n1/n2)_6000, and with spots is (n1/n2)_5500. The question is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So it's (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) / exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\n= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\n= exp( (8.57 eV)/(8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\n= exp( 99433 K * (-1.515e-5 K^-1) )\n\n= exp( -1.5064 )\n\nWhich is about 0.2217.\n\nSo the ratio without spots is 0.2217 times the ratio with spots. Or, the ratio with spots is higher than without.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me re-express this.\n\nLet me denote R1 = (n1/n2) at T1 (6000 K)\n\nR2 = (n1/n2) at T2 (5500 K)\n\nWe have R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )\n\nR2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) ( (1/6000 -1/5500) ) )\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5) )\n\n= exp( -1.5064 ) \u2248 0.2217.\n\nSo R1 is 0.2217 times R2. So R1 = 0.2217 * R2.\n\nWhich means that R1 is smaller than R2.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because when T increases, the ratio R1 should increase, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, because when T is higher, the exponential term (E2-E1)/(kT) is smaller, so the exponent is smaller, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is larger, so R = (g1/g2) * exp(...) would be larger.\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, R1 is 0.2217 * R2. So if R2 is larger, then R1 is smaller.\n\nWhich would imply that when T decreases, the ratio R increases. But according to earlier analysis, when T increases, the ratio R (n1/n2) increases.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is:\n\nn_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(kT) )\n\nIn our case, i=1 and j=2.\n\nSo, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\n= (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo for T1=6000 K, R1 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )\n\nFor T2=5500 K, R2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nBut 1/T1 -1/T2 is negative, so (1/T1 -1/T2) = -1.515e-5.\n\nSo the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5) )= -1.5064.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp(-1.5064) \u2248 0.2217.\n\nSo R1 = 0.2217 * R2.\n\nWhich means that when the star doesn't have spots (R1), the ratio is 0.2217 times R2, which is the ratio when the star has spots.\n\nSo R1 is lower than R2. Wait, but this contradicts the earlier analysis.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because if T is higher, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) is smaller, so exp( that ) is larger. So R1 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k *6000) )\n\nWhich is (g1/g2) * exp( a smaller number ) \u2192 larger value.\n\nWait, so R1 is larger than R2. Because T1 is higher than T2.\n\nSo why is the calculation showing R1/R2 = 0.2217, which is less than 1?\n\nHmm, that suggests that R1 is smaller than R2, which would be the opposite of what I thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me re-express R1/R2.\n\nR1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )\n\nBut since 1/T1 < 1/T2 (because T1 > T2), (1/T1 -1/T2) is negative.\n\nSo the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (negative number), which is negative.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( negative ) \u2192 less than 1.\n\nWhich implies R1 < R2.\n\nSo when T increases, R increases, but according to the calculation, R1 is less than R2, which would imply that R increases as T decreases. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the definition of R1 and R2.\n\nWait, R1 is (n1/n2) at T1=6000 K.\n\nR2 is (n1/n2) at T2=5500 K.\n\nIf T increases, n1/n2 increases, so R1 should be larger than R2.\n\nBut according to the calculation, R1/R2 is 0.2217, which is less than 1. So R1 < R2.\n\nThat's a contradiction.\n\nWait, I think the mistake is in the formula. Let me re-express the Boltzmann equation.\n\nn_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(kT) )\n\nIf E_i > E_j, then (E_i - E_j) is positive, so -(E_i - E_j) is negative. So exp(negative) is less than 1.\n\nWait, but in our case, E2 > E1, so E_i (for i=2) is higher than E_j (for j=1). Wait, no, no. Wait, I'm comparing n1 and n2.\n\nWait, if E2 > E1, then for the ratio n1/n2, which is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), because n1 is lower energy.\n\nWait, let's take a simple example. Suppose E2 is higher than E1.\n\nAt higher T, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller (since T is larger), so exp( that ) is larger.\n\nSo n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo if T increases, the ratio n1/n2 increases, assuming g1/g2 is fixed.\n\nSo if T1 > T2, then R1 = (n1/n2)_T1 > R2 = (n1/n2)_T2.\n\nSo in our case, T1=6000 K, R1 is higher than R2.\n\nBut according to the calculation, R1/R2 = 0.2217 <1, which implies R1 < R2. That can't be.\n\nSo where is the mistake?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the calculation of (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) is incorrect.\n\nWait, 1/T1 -1/T2 is negative, so the product is negative.\n\nSo the exponent is negative, so exp(negative) is less than 1. So R1/R2 = exp(negative) \u2192 R1 < R2.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, when T increases, the ratio R should increase. So this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I have a sign error in the formula.\n\nWait, let me re-derive the formula.\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo the ratio is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo for T1=6000 K, it's exp( (E2 - E1)/(k *6000) )\n\nFor T2=5500 K, it's exp( (E2 - E1)/(k *5500) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\n= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5) )\n\nWhich is exp( -1.5064 ) \u22480.2217.\n\nSo R1 = 0.2217 * R2.\n\nWhich implies R1 < R2.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T should lead to higher R, so R1 should be larger than R2.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the ratio backwards.\n\nWait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than without. So R2 (with spots) is lower than R1 (without spots).\n\nBut according to the calculation, R1 = 0.2217 * R2 \u2192 R1 < R2. So this contradicts the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused n1 and n2 in the ratio. Maybe the ratio observed is n2/n1, not n1/n2.\n\nLet me reevaluate.\n\nThe problem says: the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots.\n\nSo when the star has spots, the ratio is lower.\n\nIf the ratio is n1/n2, then when the star has spots (T=5500 K), n1/n2 is lower than when T=6000 K.\n\nWhich would imply that R1 (T=6000) > R2 (T=5500).\n\nSo according to our earlier calculation, R1/R2 = 0.2217 \u2192 R1 = 0.2217 R2 \u2192 R1 < R2.\n\nWhich contradicts the problem statement.\n\nSo perhaps the ratio is n2/n1 instead.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf the ratio is n2/n1, then when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.\n\nSo n2/n1 is higher when T is higher.\n\nLet me compute (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.\n\nWhich is [ (n2/n1) at T=6000 ] / [ (n2/n1) at T=5500 ]\n\n= [ (g2/g1) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T2) ) ]\n\nThe (g2/g1) cancels, so it's exp( (E1-E2)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )\n\n= exp( -(E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )\n\n= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )\n\nWhich is the reciprocal of the previous factor.\n\nSo if R1/R2 (n1/n2) was 0.2217, then (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 = 1/0.2217 \u22484.51.\n\nSo if the ratio observed is n2/n1, then when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Because (n2/n1)_5500 is lower than (n2/n1)_6000.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIf the ratio observed is n2/n1, then when T increases, the ratio increases.\n\nSo when T=6000, n2/n1 is higher than when T=5500. So (n2/n1)_6000 > (n2/n1)_5500.\n\nWhich is the case if the factor (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 is greater than 1.\n\nWhich is indeed 4.51.\n\nSo the factor by which the ratio changes is 4.51, meaning that without spots, the ratio is 4.51 times higher than when it has spots.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5.\n\nSo the answer should be C.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \\frac{g_1}{g_2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \\(E_2 - E_1\\) is the energy difference between the levels, \\(k\\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is proportional to \\(\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\\right)\\).\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Energy Difference**: The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \\(1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\). Using the relation \\(E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\), the energy difference is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   E_2 - E_1 = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34})(3 \\times 10^8)}{1448 \\times 10^{-10}} \\approx 8.57 \\, \\text{eV}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Temperatures**:\n   - Without spots: \\(T_1 = 6000 \\, \\text{K}\\),\n   - With spots: \\(T_2 = 5500 \\, \\text{K}\\).\n\n3. **Boltzmann Factor**:\n   The ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels changes by a factor:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{T_1}}{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{T_2}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)\\right).\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the values:\n   - \\(k = 8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/K}\\),\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{6000} - \\frac{1}{5500} \\approx -1.515 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{K}^{-1}\\),\n   - \\(\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \\frac{8.57}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 99433 \\, \\text{K}\\).\n\n   The exponent becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right) = 99433 \\times (-1.515 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx -1.5064.\n   \\]\n\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{T_1}}{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{T_2}} = \\exp(-1.5064) \\approx 0.2217.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Interpretation**:\n   The ratio \\(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\) decreases when the star has spots (lower temperature). The factor by which the ratio changes is the reciprocal of this value, as the problem asks for the ratio when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{T_1}}{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{T_2}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.2217} \\approx 4.5.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**, corresponding to **Option C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll walk through my thoughts step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. \n\nThe question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nHmm, okay. So I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when spots are present, the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases. But wait, are the spots affecting the overall photospheric temperature? Or do they just block some light and thus lower the observed effective temperature? Oh, wait, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So I think the spots cause part of the surface to be cooler, but the question is about the photosphere as a whole. Or maybe the spots are at a lower temperature, so when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is lower. But the problem says that in the photosphere, when examining the ratio, it decreases when the star has spots. So I think the effective temperature here refers to the temperature of the photosphere, which is lower when spots are present.\n\nWait, but when spots are present, the average temperature of the photosphere goes down. So the temperature T in the Boltzmann equation would be lower when there are spots. So the ratio n2/n1 would depend on T. Let me think: the energy difference between levels 1 and 2 can be found from the wavelength of the transition. Since the transition corresponds to 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near-infrared. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/\u03bb. So E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m). Let me compute that.\n\nBut wait, the energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1. So let's compute that. But maybe I can express it in terms of kT, since that's what will be in the exponent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the Boltzmann factors when T is 6000 K and when T is 5500 K. Since the problem says the ratio n2/n1 decreases when there are spots. So when T decreases, the ratio n2/n1 goes down. Because the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller.\n\nWait, but the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( - (\u0394E)/(k T) ). So if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio decreases. That matches the observation in the problem.\n\nSo the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it does (T=5500 K). So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.\n\nUsing the Boltzmann equation: (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nAssuming that the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same for both cases (which isn't stated, but perhaps they are considering only the ratio, so g2/g1 would be a constant factor and cancel out when taking the ratio of the ratios. So the factor we're looking for is exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k T_5500) ) - (E2-E1)/(k T_6000) ) ] ) )\n\nWait, let's see: the ratio (n2/n1) at T1 is (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ), and at T2 it's (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ). So the ratio of these two is exp( (\u0394E/(k T2) ) - (\u0394E/(k T1) )) ) = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )\n\nBut wait, because when T decreases, the exponent is more negative, making the ratio smaller. So the factor (n2/n1)_T1 / (n2/n1)_T2 would be exp( [ (\u0394E/(k T2) ) - (\u0394E/(k T1) ) ] )\n\nWait, no, wait: Let me think again. The ratio is (n2/n1)_T1 divided by (n2/n1)_T2. So it's [ (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ] ) ] = exp( [ -\u0394E/(k T1) + \u0394E/(k T2) ) ] ) ) = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )\n\nYes. So that's the factor.\n\nSo we can compute this exponent. Let's compute the value.\n\nFirst, we need to find \u0394E = E2 - E1. We can compute this from the wavelength \u03bb=1448 \u00c5. Using E = hc/\u03bb. Let's calculate \u0394E.\n\nBut since we'll be dealing with ratios involving T, perhaps it's easier to compute \u0394E/(k) in terms of energy per temperature. Let's compute \u0394E/(k) in units of Kelvin.\n\nWait, because the exponent is (\u0394E/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). So let's compute (\u0394E/(k)).\n\nGiven \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 meters.\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nk = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nSo E = hc/\u03bb = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) \n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J.\n\nNow, \u0394E/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) \u2248 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = approximately (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 \u2248 approximately 0.995 * 1e5 \u2248 99500 K.\n\nWait, 1e5 is 100,000. So about 99500 K.\n\nWait, but let me be precise. Let me compute 1.373 / 1.38.\n\n1.373 / 1.38 \u2248 0.995 approximately. So 0.995e5 is 99500 K.\n\nSo \u0394E/(k) \u2248 99500 K.\n\nSo the exponent is 99500 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) K.\n\nCompute 1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818 per K.\n\n1/6000 \u2248 0.000166667 per K.\n\nSo the difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 \u2248 0.000015151 per K.\n\nMultiply by 99500:\n\n99500 * 0.000015151 \u2248 Let me compute 99500 * 0.000015151.\n\nHmm, 99500 * 1.5151e-5 = 99500 * 0.000015151.\n\nLet me compute 100,000 * 0.000015151 = 1.5151. But since it's 99500, which is 99.5% of 100,000, so 1.5151 * 0.995 \u2248 approximately 1.507.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.507.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.507) \u2248 e^1.507.\n\nWe know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817, and e^1.6 is about 4.953. Let me compute e^1.507.\n\nLet me compute it more accurately.\n\nWe can approximate e^1.507.\n\n1.507 is 1.5 + 0.007.\n\ne^1.5 \u2248 4.4817.\n\nThe derivative of e^x at x=1.5 is e^1.5 \u2248 4.4817.\n\nSo the increase from 1.5 to 1.507 is 0.007 in x, so the approximate increase in e^x is 4.4817 * 0.007 \u2248 0.03137.\n\nSo e^1.507 \u2248 4.4817 + 0.03137 \u2248 4.513.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator: e^1.507 \u2248 4.513.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation. Did I make any mistake in the steps?\n\nLet me go back. The exponent was 99500 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 99500 * ( (6000 - 5500) ) / (5500 * 6000) ) )\n\nWhich is 99500 * (500) / (5500 * 6000) )\n\n500/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 5/(330,000) ) \u2248 1.515e-5.\n\nThen 99500 * 1.515e-5 = ?\n\nLet me compute 99500 * 1.515e-5.\n\n99500 is 9.95e4.\n\nMultiply by 1.515e-5: 9.95e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.95 * 1.515) * 1e-1.\n\nCompute 9.95 * 1.515.\n\nWell, 10 * 1.515 is 15.15. Subtract 0.05 *1.515=0.07575, so 15.15 - 0.07575 = 15.07425.\n\nMultiply by 0.1: 1.507425.\n\nSo the exponent is 1.507425.\n\ne^1.507425 \u2248 e^1.5 * e^0.007425.\n\ne^1.5 is 4.481689.\n\ne^0.007425 \u2248 1 + 0.007425 + (0.007425)^2/2 \u2248 1.007443 (since 0.007425^2 is about 5.5e-5, so 0.000055, and 0.000055/2 is 0.0000275. So 1 + 0.007425 = 1.007425 + 0.0000275 \u2248 1.0074525.)\n\nSo e^1.507425 \u2248 4.481689 * 1.0074525 \u2248 let's compute 4.481689 * 1.0074525.\n\nCompute 4.481689 * 1.007 = approximately 4.481689 + (4.481689 * 0.007) = 4.481689 + 0.0313718 \u2248 4.51306.\n\nAnd 0.0004525 more. So 4.51306 * (1 + 0.0004525) \u2248 4.51306 + (4.51306 * 0.0004525) \u2248 4.51306 + 0.00204 \u2248 4.5151.\n\nSo approximately 4.515.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is very close.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5, so the answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll walk through my thoughts step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. \n\nThe question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nHmm, okay. So I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when spots are present, the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases. But wait, are the spots affecting the overall photospheric temperature? Or do they just block some light and thus lower the observed effective temperature? Oh, wait, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So I think the spots cause part of the surface to be cooler, but the question is about the photosphere as a whole. Or maybe the spots are at a lower temperature, so when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is lower. But the problem says that in the photosphere, when examining the ratio, it decreases when the star has spots. So I think the effective temperature here refers to the temperature of the photosphere, which is lower when spots are present.\n\nWait, but when spots are present, the average temperature of the photosphere goes down. So the temperature T in the Boltzmann equation would be lower when there are spots. So the ratio n2/n1 would depend on T. Let me think: the energy difference between levels 1 and 2 can be found from the wavelength of the transition. Since the transition corresponds to 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near-infrared. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/\u03bb. So E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m). Let me compute that.\n\nBut wait, the energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1. So let's compute that. But maybe I can express it in terms of kT, since that's what will be in the exponent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the Boltzmann factors when T is 6000 K and when T is 5500 K. Since the problem says the ratio n2/n1 decreases when there are spots. So when T decreases, the ratio n2/n1 goes down. Because the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller.\n\nWait, but the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( - (\u0394E)/(k T) ). So if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio decreases. That matches the observation in the problem.\n\nSo the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it does (T=5500 K). So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.\n\nUsing the Boltzmann equation: (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nAssuming that the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same for both cases (which isn't stated, but perhaps they are considering only the ratio, so g2/g1 would be a constant factor and cancel out when taking the ratio of the ratios. So the factor we're looking for is exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k T_5500) ) - (E2-E1)/(k T_6000) ) ] ) )\n\nWait, let's see: the ratio (n2/n1) at T1 is (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ), and at T2 it's (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ). So the ratio of these two is exp( (\u0394E/(k T2) ) - (\u0394E/(k T1) )) ) = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )\n\nBut wait, because when T decreases, the exponent is more negative, making the ratio smaller. So the factor (n2/n1)_T1 / (n2/n1)_T2 would be exp( [ (\u0394E/(k T2) ) - (\u0394E/(k T1) ) ] )\n\nWait, no, wait: Let me think again. The ratio is (n2/n1)_T1 divided by (n2/n1)_T2. So it's [ (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ] ) ] = exp( [ -\u0394E/(k T1) + \u0394E/(k T2) ) ] ) ) = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )\n\nYes. So that's the factor.\n\nSo we can compute this exponent. Let's compute the value.\n\nFirst, we need to find \u0394E = E2 - E1. We can compute this from the wavelength \u03bb=1448 \u00c5. Using E = hc/\u03bb. Let's calculate \u0394E.\n\nBut since we'll be dealing with ratios involving T, perhaps it's easier to compute \u0394E/(k) in terms of energy per temperature. Let's compute \u0394E/(k) in units of Kelvin.\n\nWait, because the exponent is (\u0394E/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). So let's compute (\u0394E/(k)).\n\nGiven \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 meters.\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nk = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nSo E = hc/\u03bb = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) \n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J.\n\nNow, \u0394E/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) \u2248 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = approximately (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 \u2248 approximately 0.995 * 1e5 \u2248 99500 K.\n\nWait, 1e5 is 100,000. So about 99500 K.\n\nWait, but let me be precise. Let me compute 1.373 / 1.38.\n\n1.373 / 1.38 \u2248 0.995 approximately. So 0.995e5 is 99500 K.\n\nSo \u0394E/(k) \u2248 99500 K.\n\nSo the exponent is 99500 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) K.\n\nCompute 1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818 per K.\n\n1/6000 \u2248 0.000166667 per K.\n\nSo the difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 \u2248 0.000015151 per K.\n\nMultiply by 99500:\n\n99500 * 0.000015151 \u2248 Let me compute 99500 * 0.000015151.\n\nHmm, 99500 * 1.5151e-5 = 99500 * 0.000015151.\n\nLet me compute 100,000 * 0.000015151 = 1.5151. But since it's 99500, which is 99.5% of 100,000, so 1.5151 * 0.995 \u2248 approximately 1.507.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.507.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.507) \u2248 e^1.507.\n\nWe know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817, and e^1.6 is about 4.953. Let me compute e^1.507.\n\nLet me compute it more accurately.\n\nWe can approximate e^1.507.\n\n1.507 is 1.5 + 0.007.\n\ne^1.5 \u2248 4.4817.\n\nThe derivative of e^x at x=1.5 is e^1.5 \u2248 4.4817.\n\nSo the increase from 1.5 to 1.507 is 0.007 in x, so the approximate increase in e^x is 4.4817 * 0.007 \u2248 0.03137.\n\nSo e^1.507 \u2248 4.4817 + 0.03137 \u2248 4.513.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator: e^1.507 \u2248 4.513.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation. Did I make any mistake in the steps?\n\nLet me go back. The exponent was 99500 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 99500 * ( (6000 - 5500) ) / (5500 * 6000) ) )\n\nWhich is 99500 * (500) / (5500 * 6000) )\n\n500/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 5/(330,000) ) \u2248 1.515e-5.\n\nThen 99500 * 1.515e-5 = ?\n\nLet me compute 99500 * 1.515e-5.\n\n99500 is 9.95e4.\n\nMultiply by 1.515e-5: 9.95e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.95 * 1.515) * 1e-1.\n\nCompute 9.95 * 1.515.\n\nWell, 10 * 1.515 is 15.15. Subtract 0.05 *1.515=0.07575, so 15.15 - 0.07575 = 15.07425.\n\nMultiply by 0.1: 1.507425.\n\nSo the exponent is 1.507425.\n\ne^1.507425 \u2248 e^1.5 * e^0.007425.\n\ne^1.5 is 4.481689.\n\ne^0.007425 \u2248 1 + 0.007425 + (0.007425)^2/2 \u2248 1.007443 (since 0.007425^2 is about 5.5e-5, so 0.000055, and 0.000055/2 is 0.0000275. So 1 + 0.007425 = 1.007425 + 0.0000275 \u2248 1.0074525.)\n\nSo e^1.507425 \u2248 4.481689 * 1.0074525 \u2248 let's compute 4.481689 * 1.0074525.\n\nCompute 4.481689 * 1.007 = approximately 4.481689 + (4.481689 * 0.007) = 4.481689 + 0.0313718 \u2248 4.51306.\n\nAnd 0.0004525 more. So 4.51306 * (1 + 0.0004525) \u2248 4.51306 + (4.51306 * 0.0004525) \u2248 4.51306 + 0.00204 \u2248 4.5151.\n\nSo approximately 4.515.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is very close.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5, so the answer is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2, under the influence of the star's changing effective temperature.
