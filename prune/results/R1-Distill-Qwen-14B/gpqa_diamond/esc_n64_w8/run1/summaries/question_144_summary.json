      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? And this one is a resonance, which I think means it's a short-lived particle. The question is asking about the mean decay distance. Oh right, that's the average distance the particle travels before decaying.\n\nThe given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so the answer is going to be a very small distance.\n\nWait, how do I calculate the mean decay distance? I think it involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, how do I get the lifetime from the given parameters?\n\nI remember that the width \u0393 is related to the particle's lifetime \u03c4 by the uncertainty principle. The relation is \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4, so \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 has units of energy times time, so I need to make sure the units match.\n\nWait, let me think again. The natural units in particle physics often use \u0127 = 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm, where fm is femtometers (10^-15 meters). So perhaps I can use that. But first, I need to find the lifetime \u03c4, then multiply by velocity to get the decay length.\n\nAlternatively, the mean decay distance can be calculated using the formula: L = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2, where \u03b2 is v/c. But I need to find \u03b2, the velocity of the particle. Since the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, I should use the relativistic formulas.\n\nThe energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So I can find the Lorentz factor \u03b3. Gamma is E/(m c\u00b2), but since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c\u00b2, I can just compute \u03b3 as E/(m) because the c\u00b2 cancels out in the units. So \u03b3 = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... or 20/3.\n\nNow, the velocity \u03b2 is sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). Let me compute that. \u03b3 is 20/3 \u2248 6.6667. So 1/\u03b3\u00b2 is (9/400) = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Taking the square root, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So \u03b2 \u2248 0.9887c.\n\nNow, onto the lifetime. The width \u0393 is 320 MeV. Since \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But \u0127 is about 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Wait, let me get the correct value. I think \u0127 is approximately 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm, but when converted to GeV, it's 0.19733 GeV\u00b7fm. Alternatively, \u0127 in units of GeV\u00b7seconds is 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, let me be precise. The reduced Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7seconds. So if \u0393 is given in GeV, I can compute \u03c4.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32 ) \u00d7 1e-25 s \u2248 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, 6.582 divided by 0.32. Let me calculate that: 0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 6.582 /0.32 is about 20.56875.\n\nSo \u03c4 \u2248 20.56875 \u00d7 1e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, wait, no: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25. So 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, but that seems extremely short. Let me double-check the calculation. Oh, no, wait: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, multiplied by 1e-25, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.\n\nNow, the mean decay length is L = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2. Let me compute that.\n\nc is approximately 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) * 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute the numbers step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875e-16 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nThen multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 approximately 6.108e-16 m.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the options are in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 m range.\n\nWait, my calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m. But the options are A) 5.02e-16, D) 4.06e-16, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let's recompute beta.\n\nBeta = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)) )\n\nWait, but in natural units where c=1, it's sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2)/(E\u00b2)).\n\nGiven E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV.\n\nSo m\u00b2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44, E\u00b2 is 64.\n\n1 - 1.44 /64 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. That part is correct.\n\nSo beta is about 0.9887.\n\nNow, the calculation of L:\n\nL = c * tau * beta.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo c * tau is 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nMultiply by beta (0.9887): 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 let me compute this more accurately.\n\n6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6.170625 * 0.9887.\n\n6 * 0.9887 is 5.9322.\n\n0.170625 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.170625 * ~0.99 = 0.169.\n\nSo approximately 5.9322 + 0.169 = 6.1012.\n\nSo L \u2248 6.1012e-16 m.\n\nWait, but the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nHmm, my calculation is around 6.1e-16 m, but the closest option is A (5.02e-16) or D (4.06e-16). So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation of tau. Let me recheck that step.\n\nTau is \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nI used \u0127 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. \u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25.\n\n6.582 divided by 0.32: 0.32 *20 =6.4. 0.32 *20.56875=6.582.\n\nSo 6.582/0.32 =20.56875.\n\nSo tau =20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should use \u0127 in different units? Because sometimes people use different units for \u0127, like 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo \u0127 = 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm.\n\nBut the width \u0393 is 320 MeV, so tau = \u0127 / \u0393 = (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm) / (320 MeV) )= (197.33 /320) fm.\n\n197.33 /320 is approximately 0.61665 fm. So tau is 0.61665 fm.\n\nWait, but 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. So tau is 0.61665e-15 meters. But wait, that's time, right? No, wait, no, because I think I confused units. Because \u0127 is in MeV\u00b7fm, and \u0393 is in MeV, so when I divide, the units would be fm, but that can't be correct because tau is a time.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use \u0127 in units of GeV\u00b7seconds.\n\nAh, perhaps that's where I went wrong. Let me try again.\n\nSo \u0127 = 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\n\u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWhich is what I did before.\n\nSo then, L = c * tau * beta.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\ntau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo c * tau is 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nThen multiply by beta, 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.10e-16 meters.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another approach: The decay length is given by L = (c * tau) * beta.\n\nBut maybe I should compute it using the relation involving the particle's lifetime and velocity. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for the mean lifetime.\n\nWait, another formula I recall is the decay length L = (gamma * c * tau) * beta, but wait, gamma is 1/(sqrt(1-beta^2)), so gamma beta is (beta / sqrt(1-beta^2)) )= (gamma * beta) = (E/(m c^2)) * beta.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find L using gamma, beta, and the mean proper lifetime tau_0.\n\nWait, the proper lifetime tau_0 is tau when the particle is at rest, which is tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma. Wait, but earlier I used tau = \u0127 / Gamma, which would be the lifetime in the lab frame, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm mixing proper time and lab time.\n\nWait, no, the width \u0393 is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime as Gamma = \u0127 / tau. So tau is the mean lifetime in the lab frame. So perhaps I shouldn't apply any gamma factor here, because tau is already the lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nThe width Gamma is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime is tau = \u0127 / Gamma. But this tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). Because when a particle decays, the decay width is the same in all frames. So to get the lifetime in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the particle, I need to consider time dilation. So the lab frame lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime.\n\nSo tau_lab = gamma * (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nAh, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier by not including the gamma factor. Because I used tau = \u0127 / Gamma as the proper lifetime, but then used it in the lab frame.\n\nWait, so the correct approach would be:\n\ntau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = gamma * (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nSo the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime by a factor of gamma.\n\nSo that changes the calculation.\n\nSo let me recalculate.\n\nGamma (\u03b3) is E/(m c^2) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.\n\nTau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nTau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\n20/3 is approximately 6.666666667.\n\nSo 6.666666667 * 2.056875e-24 s = let's compute that.\n\n2.056875e-24 * 6.666666667 \u2248 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nWait, that's much bigger than before. So tau_lab is 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nNow, the decay length L is c * tau_lab * beta.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s * beta.\n\nBeta is 0.9887.\n\nSo compute 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (3 *1.37125) * 1e-15 = 4.11375e-15 m.\n\nThen multiply by 0.9887: 4.11375e-15 * 0.9887 \u2248 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's option B: 4.0655e-15 m. Or wait, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, but looking back, the options are:\n\nA) 5.0223 *1e-16\n\nB)4.0655e-15\n\nC)5.0223e-15\n\nD)4.0655e-16\n\nSo the calculation gives 4.0655e-15 m, which is option B.\n\nWait, but earlier when I didn't include gamma, I got about 6e-16 m. So that was a mistake because I forgot to account for time dilation.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the proper lifetime tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma, then multiply by gamma to get the lab frame lifetime, then compute L = c * tau_lab * beta.\n\nSo with that, the answer would be option B, 4.0655e-15 m.\n",

Let me compute that.\n\nc is approximately 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) * 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute the numbers step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875e-16 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nThen multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 approximately 6.108e-16 m.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the options are in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 m range.\n\nWait, my calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m. But the options are A) 5.02e-16, D) 4.06e-16, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let's recompute beta.\n\nBeta = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)) )\n\nWait, but in natural units where c=1, it's sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2)/(E\u00b2)).\n\nGiven E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV.\n\nSo m\u00b2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44, E\u00b2 is 64.\n\n1 - 1.44 /64 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. That part is correct.\n\nSo beta is about 0.9887.\n\nNow, the calculation of L:\n\nL = c * tau * beta.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo c * tau is 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nMultiply by beta (0.9887): 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 let me compute this more accurately.\n\n6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6.170625 * 0.9887.\n\n6 * 0.9887 is 5.9322.\n\n0.170625 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.170625 * ~0.99 = 0.169.\n\nSo approximately 5.9322 + 0.169 = 6.1012.\n\nSo L \u2248 6.1012e-16 m.\n\nWait, but the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nHmm, my calculation is around 6.1e-16 m, but the closest option is A (5.02e-16) or D (4.06e-16). So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation of tau. Let me recheck that step.\n\nTau is \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nI used \u0127 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. \u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25.\n\n6.582 divided by 0.32: 0.32 *20 =6.4. 0.32 *20.56875=6.582.\n\nSo 6.582/0.32 =20.56875.\n\nSo tau =20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should use \u0127 in different units? Because sometimes people use different units for \u0127, like 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo \u0127 = 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm.\n\nBut the width \u0393 is 320 MeV, so tau = \u0127 / \u0393 = (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm) / (320 MeV) )= (197.33 /320) fm.\n\n197.33 /320 is approximately 0.61665 fm. So tau is 0.61665 fm.\n\nWait, but 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. So tau is 0.61665e-15 meters. But wait, that's time, right? No, wait, no, because I think I confused units. Because \u0127 is in MeV\u00b7fm, and \u0393 is in MeV, so when I divide, the units would be fm, but that can't be correct because tau is a time.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use \u0127 in units of GeV\u00b7seconds.\n\nAh, perhaps that's where I went wrong. Let me try again.\n\nSo \u0127 = 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\n\u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWhich is what I did before.\n\nSo then, L = c * tau * beta.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\ntau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo c * tau is 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nThen multiply by beta, 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.10e-16 meters.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another approach: The decay length is given by L = (c * tau) * beta.\n\nBut maybe I should compute it using the relation involving the particle's lifetime and velocity. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for the mean lifetime.\n\nWait, another formula I recall is the decay length L = (gamma * c * tau) * beta, but wait, gamma is 1/(sqrt(1-beta^2)), so gamma beta is (beta / sqrt(1-beta^2)) )= (gamma * beta) = (E/(m c^2)) * beta.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find L using gamma, beta, and the mean proper lifetime tau_0.\n\nWait, the proper lifetime tau_0 is tau when the particle is at rest, which is tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma. Wait, but earlier I used tau = \u0127 / Gamma, which would be the lifetime in the lab frame, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm mixing proper time and lab time.\n\nWait, no, the width \u0393 is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime as Gamma = \u0127 / tau. So tau is the mean lifetime in the lab frame. So perhaps I shouldn't apply any gamma factor here, because tau is already the lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nThe width Gamma is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime is tau = \u0127 / Gamma. But this tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). Because when a particle decays, the decay width is the same in all frames. So to get the lifetime in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the particle, I need to consider time dilation. So the lab frame lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime.\n\nSo tau_lab = gamma * (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nAh, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier by not including the gamma factor. Because I used tau = \u0127 / Gamma as the proper lifetime, but then used it in the lab frame.\n\nWait, so the correct approach would be:\n\ntau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = gamma * (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nSo the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime by a factor of gamma.\n\nSo that changes the calculation.\n\nSo let me recalculate.\n\nGamma (\u03b3) is E/(m c^2) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.\n\nTau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nTau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\n20/3 is approximately 6.666666667.\n\nSo 6.666666667 * 2.056875e-24 s = let's compute that.\n\n2.056875e-24 * 6.666666667 \u2248 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nWait, that's much bigger than before. So tau_lab is 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nNow, the decay length L is c * tau_lab * beta.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s * beta.\n\nBeta is 0.9887.\n\nSo compute 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (3 *1.37125) * 1e-15 = 4.11375e-15 m.\n\nThen multiply by 0.9887: 4.11375e-15 * 0.9887 \u2248 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's option B: 4.0655e-15 m. Or wait, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, but looking back, the options are:\n\nA) 5.0223 *1e-16\n\nB)4.0655e-15\n\nC)5.0223e-15\n\nD)4.0655e-16\n\nSo the calculation gives 4.0655e-15 m, which is option B.\n\nWait, but earlier when I didn't include gamma, I got about 6e-16 m. So that was a mistake because I forgot to account for time dilation.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the proper lifetime tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma, then multiply by gamma to get the lab frame lifetime, then compute L = c * tau_lab * beta.\n\nSo with that, the answer would be option B, 4.0655e-15 m.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nL = c \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}} \\cdot \\beta\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is the speed of light, \\( \\tau_{\\text{lab}} \\) is the lifetime of the particle in the lab frame, and \\( \\beta = v/c \\) is the velocity of the particle relative to the speed of light.\n\n### Step 1: Relating lifetime and decay width\nThe mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck constant (\\( \\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s} \\)) and \\( \\Gamma \\) is the total decay width.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are particles, right? Like, they're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about the mean decay distance. I think that has to do with how far the meson travels before it decays.\n\nSo the given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.\n\nWait, I think the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like L = gamma * c * tau. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Because particles moving at relativistic speeds have their lifetimes dilated.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the lifetime tau? I remember that the width \u0393 is related to the lifetime. Oh right, the uncertainty principle: \u0393 is the total decay width, and the lifetime tau is inversely proportional to \u0393. Specifically, tau is equal to \u0127 divided by \u0393. But wait, I should make sure about the units here.\n\nLet me think. Gamma (\u0393) is the decay rate, and it's related to the mean lifetime by \u0393 = \u0127 / tau. So tau = \u0127 / \u0393. Then, gamma (Lorentz factor) is E / (m c\u00b2), but wait, E is the energy of the particle, which for a relativistic particle is gamma m c\u00b2. So E_X is given as 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So gamma would be E_X / (m_X c\u00b2), but wait, since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, when I divide E by m, the c\u00b2 cancels out, right?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify units. E = gamma m c\u00b2. So gamma is E / (m c\u00b2). But when using E in GeV and m in GeV/c\u00b2, let me see: Let's calculate gamma.\n\nE_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So gamma = E_X / (m_X c\u00b2) \u2192 but wait, E is in GeV, and m c\u00b2 is in GeV as well. Because m_X c\u00b2 is 1.2 GeV, so gamma would be 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nWait, but wait, GeV and GeV/c\u00b2. Let me think: E = gamma m c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = E / (m c\u00b2). So units-wise, E is GeV, m c\u00b2 is GeV, so gamma is unitless, which is correct.\n\nSo gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666..., which is approximately 6.6667.\n\nNow, the lifetime tau is \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, I need to make sure about the units. Gamma is given in MeV, so I should convert that to GeV to match units. \u0393_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau = \u0127 / (\u0393_X). Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So tau = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) seconds.\n\nCalculating that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, no, wait, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no, wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.\n\nLet me compute 6.582 / 0.32. Let's see: 0.32 \u00d7 20 = 6.4, so 20.5625 would be 0.32 \u00d7 20.5625 = 6.58, which is close to 6.582. So 6.582 / 0.32 \u2248 20.56875. So tau \u2248 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. So 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so tau is 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no, wait, 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s = 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, that can't be right because 20e-25 is 2e-24, which seems too long for a meson lifetime. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused tau with something else. Let me think again. The width \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = \u0127 / \u0393. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32:\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = (6.582 * 1000) / 320 = 6582 / 320 \u2248 20.56875. So tau \u2248 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, that's 2.05e-24 seconds. But that seems too long. Because particles with GeV-scale masses usually have lifetimes on the order of 1e-24 seconds, but maybe that's okay. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, the mean decay length L is gamma * c * tau.\n\nWait, but gamma is the Lorentz factor. So L = gamma * v * tau. Wait, but v is approximately c for high-energy particles, so L \u2248 gamma * c * tau.\n\nSo putting it all together: L = gamma * c * tau.\n\nGamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2 = (8 / 1.2) c\u00b2 = 6.6667 c\u00b2? Wait no, that's not right. Wait, gamma is E/(m c\u00b2), which is (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 /1.2 = 6.6667. So gamma is 6.6667.\n\nNow, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 meters per second. Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nSo L = 6.6667 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply 6.6667 by 3e8: 6.6667 * 3e8 = 2e9? Wait, 6.6667 is approximately 20/3, so 20/3 * 3e8 = 20e8 = 2e9 m/s.\n\nThen, multiply by tau: 2e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2e9 * 2.056875e-24 m.\n\nMultiplying 2e9 and 2.056875e-24 gives 4.11375e-15 meters.\n\nWait, so L \u2248 4.11375e-15 meters. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.\n\nWait, so my calculation gives approximately 4.11e-15 m, but the closest option is B) 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check the numbers again. Maybe I approximated too much. Let's compute more accurately.\n\nGamma is exactly 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... = 20/3.\n\nTau calculation: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25.\n\n6.582 / 0.32: Let's compute that exactly.\n\n0.32 * 20 = 6.4.\n\n6.582 - 6.4 = 0.182.\n\n0.32 * 0.56875 = 0.182. Because 0.32 * 0.5 = 0.16, 0.32 * 0.06875 = 0.022, so 0.16 + 0.022 = 0.182.\n\nSo 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.\n\nSo tau is 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nNow, L = gamma * c * tau.\n\nGamma is 20/3 \u22486.666666667.\n\nc is 299792458 m/s, but for approximation, 3e8 m/s is fine.\n\nSo:\n\n6.666666667 * 3e8 m/s = 2e9 m/s.\n\nMultiply by tau: 2e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\n2e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (2 * 2.056875) * 1e-15 = 4.11375e-15 m.\n\nHmm, so that's approximately 4.11375e-15 m. But the options are A:5.02e-16, B:4.065e-15, C:5.02e-15, D:4.06e-16.\n\nSo my calculation is 4.11e-15, which is close to option B (4.065e-15) but a bit higher.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.\n\nE_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nGamma = E/(m c\u00b2). So E is in GeV, m c\u00b2 is in GeV, so gamma is E/(m) =8/1.2 = 6.6666666667.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the precise value of \u0127 is important. I used 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Maybe the exact value is 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s, but perhaps a more precise calculation would adjust this.\n\nWait, let me compute the exact value of tau again.\n\nTau = \u0127 / (Gamma). So:\n\n\u0127 = 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\nTau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = let's compute this precisely.\n\n6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32 ) \u00d7 1e-25.\n\n6.582 \u00f7 0.32: Let's compute 6.582 / 0.32.\n\n0.32 \u00d7 20 = 6.4 \u2192 6.582-6.4=0.182.\n\n0.182 \u00f7 0.32 = 0.56875.\n\nSo 20.56875 \u2192 so 20.56875 \u00d7 1e-25 \u2192 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's compute L exactly:\n\nL = gamma * c * tau.\n\nGamma: 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666666666667.\n\nc: 2.99792458e8 m/s \u2192 perhaps using 2.9979e8 for more accurate calculation.\n\nSo:\n\n6.666666666666667 * 2.99792458e8 m/s = ?\n\nLet me compute 6.666666666666667 * 2.99792458e8.\n\n6.666666666666667 is 20/3.\n\n20/3 * 2.99792458e8 = (20 * 2.99792458e8) /3.\n\n20 * 2.99792458e8 = 5.99584916e9.\n\nDivide by 3: 5.99584916e9 /3 \u2248 1.998616387e9 m/s.\n\nSo velocity factor is approximately 1.9986e9 m/s.\n\nNow multiply by tau (2.056875e-24 s):\n\n1.998616387e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (1.998616387 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.\n\nCalculating 1.998616387 * 2.056875.\n\nApproximating:\n\n2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.\n\nBut 1.9986 is slightly less than 2, so 1.9986 * 2.056875 \u2248 4.11375 - (0.0014 * 2.056875) = 4.11375 - 0.00288 = ~4.11087.\n\nSo L \u2248 4.11087e-15 m.\n\nHmm, that's about 4.11e-15 meters. But the options are B:4.0655e-15 and C:5.02e-15. So my calculation is 4.11e-15, which is closer to B but not exactly matching. Did I make a mistake in the calculation somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I should use more precise values for \u0127 and c. Let me try that.\n\nThe value of \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. But perhaps more accurately, it's 6.5823 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nTau = 6.5823e-25 / 0.32 = (6.5823 / 0.32 )e-25 s.\n\n6.5823 / 0.32 = 20.5696875 \u2192 so tau is 20.5696875e-25 s = 2.05696875e-24 s.\n\nNow, gamma is 6.666666666666667.\n\nc is exactly 299792458 m/s.\n\nSo, gamma * c = 6.666666666666667 * 299792458 m/s.\n\nCompute this:\n\n6.666666666666667 is 20/3, so 20/3 * 299792458 = (20 * 299792458) /3.\n\n20 * 299,792,458 = 5,995,849,160.\n\nDivide by 3: 5,995,849,160 /3 = 1,998,616,386.666... m/s.\n\nSo gamma * c = 1,998,616,386.666 m/s.\n\nNow, multiply by tau: 1,998,616,386.666 m/s * 2.05696875e-24 s.\n\nSo 1,998,616,386.666 * 2.05696875e-24 = ?\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFirst, 1.998616386e9 m/s * 2.05696875e-24 s.\n\n1.998616386e9 * 2.05696875e-24 = (1.998616386 * 2.05696875) * 1e-15.\n\nCompute 1.998616386 * 2.05696875.\n\nLet me compute it precisely:\n\n1.998616386 * 2.05696875 = ?\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1.998616386 \u2248 2 - 0.001383614.\n\nSo, (2 - 0.001383614) * 2.05696875 = 2 * 2.05696875 - 0.001383614 * 2.05696875.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2 * 2.05696875 = 4.1139375.\n\n0.001383614 * 2.05696875 \u2248 0.002847.\n\nSo 4.1139375 - 0.002847 \u2248 4.1110905.\n\nSo, approximately 4.11109e-15 meters.\n\nHmm, that's 4.11109e-15 m, which is about 4.11e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA) 5.0223e-16 m \u2192 5e-16, which is smaller by a factor of about 8.\n\nB) 4.0655e-15 m \u2192 4.0655e-15.\n\nC) 5.0223e-15 m \u2192 5e-15.\n\nD)4.0655e-16 m \u2192 4e-16, much smaller.\n\nSo my calculation is about 4.11e-15, which is closer to option B (4.0655e-15). But why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Wait, let me think. The production energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, which is the total energy. So E = gamma m c\u00b2. So gamma is E / (m c\u00b2) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) ) = 6.6667, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the particle is produced, it's moving, so maybe the velocity isn't exactly c, but close. So perhaps I should compute beta instead of assuming v = c. Because when gamma is 6.6667, beta (v/c) is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) = sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2) ) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) )= sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So v is 0.9887c. So maybe I should use beta * c instead of c.\n\nAh, right! I think I made a mistake here. Because the meson's velocity isn't exactly c, it's beta * c. So the decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nOh, so I forgot to include the beta factor. That's a crucial mistake. So I have to correct that.\n\nSo the formula should be L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nSo let's recompute.\n\nGamma is 6.6667, so beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2) ))^2 )\n\nWait, gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.6667, so (1/gamma)^2 is (1/6.6667)^2 \u2248 (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nAlternatively, beta can be calculated as sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)) ) \u2192 but perhaps it's easier to compute as beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nSo beta \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nGamma is 6.6667, beta is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo:\n\nL = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCompute step by step.\n\nFirst, 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.6667 * 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute that: 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322; 0.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.6585. So total is about 5.9322 + 0.6585 = 6.5907.\n\nSo gamma * beta \u22486.5907.\n\nNow, multiply by c: 6.5907 * 3e8 m/s = 1.97721e9 m/s.\n\nNow, multiply by tau (2.056875e-24 s):\n\n1.97721e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (1.97721 * 2.056875 ) * 1e-15.\n\nCompute 1.97721 * 2.056875.\n\nApproximate:\n\n1.97721 * 2 = 3.95442.\n\n1.97721 * 0.056875 \u2248 0.1123.\n\nTotal \u22483.95442 + 0.1123 = 4.06672.\n\nSo L \u22484.06672e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.0667e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are particles, right? Like, they're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about the mean decay distance. I think that has to do with how far the meson travels before it decays.\n\nSo the given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.\n\nWait, I think the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like L = gamma * c * tau. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Because particles moving at relativistic speeds have their lifetimes dilated.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the lifetime tau? I remember that the width \u0393 is related to the lifetime. Oh right, the uncertainty principle: \u0393 is the total decay width, and the lifetime tau is inversely proportional to \u0393. Specifically, tau is equal to \u0127 divided by \u0393. But wait, I should make sure about the units here.\n\nLet me think. Gamma (\u0393) is the decay rate, and it's related to the mean lifetime by \u0393 = \u0127 / tau. So tau = \u0127 / \u0393. Then, gamma (Lorentz factor) is E / (m c\u00b2), but wait, E is the energy of the particle, which for a relativistic particle is gamma m c\u00b2. So E_X is given as 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So gamma would be E_X / (m_X c\u00b2), but wait, since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, when I divide E by m, the c\u00b2 cancels out, right?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify units. E = gamma m c\u00b2. So gamma is E / (m c\u00b2). But when using E in GeV and m in GeV/c\u00b2, let me see: Let's calculate gamma.\n\nE_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So gamma = E_X / (m_X c\u00b2) \u2192 but wait, E is in GeV, and m c\u00b2 is in GeV as well. Because m_X c\u00b2 is 1.2 GeV, so gamma would be 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nWait, but wait, GeV and GeV/c\u00b2. Let me think: E = gamma m c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = E / (m c\u00b2). So units-wise, E is GeV, m c\u00b2 is GeV, so gamma is unitless, which is correct.\n\nSo gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666..., which is approximately 6.6667.\n\nNow, the lifetime tau is \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, I need to make sure about the units. Gamma is given in MeV, so I should convert that to GeV to match units. \u0393_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau = \u0127 / (\u0393_X). Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So tau = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) seconds.\n\nCalculating that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, no, wait, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no, wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.\n\nLet me compute 6.582 / 0.32. Let's see: 0.32 \u00d7 20 = 6.4, so 20.5625 would be 0.32 \u00d7 20.5625 = 6.58, which is close to 6.582. So 6.582 / 0.32 \u2248 20.56875. So tau \u2248 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. So 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so tau is 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no, wait, 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s = 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, that can't be right because 20e-25 is 2e-24, which seems too long for a meson lifetime. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused tau with something else. Let me think again. The width \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = \u0127 / \u0393. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32:\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = (6.582 * 1000) / 320 = 6582 / 320 \u2248 20.56875. So tau \u2248 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, that's 2.05e-24 seconds. But that seems too long. Because particles with GeV-scale masses usually have lifetimes on the order of 1e-24 seconds, but maybe that's okay. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, the mean decay length L is gamma * c * tau.\n\nWait, but gamma is the Lorentz factor. So L = gamma * v * tau. Wait, but v is approximately c for high-energy particles, so L \u2248 gamma * c * tau.\n\nSo putting it all together: L = gamma * c * tau.\n\nGamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2 = (8 / 1.2) c\u00b2 = 6.6667 c\u00b2? Wait no, that's not right. Wait, gamma is E/(m c\u00b2), which is (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 /1.2 = 6.6667. So gamma is 6.6667.\n\nNow, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 meters per second. Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nSo L = 6.6667 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply 6.6667 by 3e8: 6.6667 * 3e8 = 2e9? Wait, 6.6667 is approximately 20/3, so 20/3 * 3e8 = 20e8 = 2e9 m/s.\n\nThen, multiply by tau: 2e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2e9 * 2.056875e-24 m.\n\nMultiplying 2e9 and 2.056875e-24 gives 4.11375e-15 meters.\n\nWait, so L \u2248 4.11375e-15 meters. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.\n\nWait, so my calculation gives approximately 4.11e-15 m, but the closest option is B) 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check the numbers again. Maybe I approximated too much. Let's compute more accurately.\n\nGamma is exactly 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... = 20/3.\n\nTau calculation: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25.\n\n6.582 / 0.32: Let's compute that exactly.\n\n0.32 * 20 = 6.4.\n\n6.582 - 6.4 = 0.182.\n\n0.32 * 0.56875 = 0.182. Because 0.32 * 0.5 = 0.16, 0.32 * 0.06875 = 0.022, so 0.16 + 0.022 = 0.182.\n\nSo 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.\n\nSo tau is 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nNow, L = gamma * c * tau.\n\nGamma is 20/3 \u22486.666666667.\n\nc is 299792458 m/s, but for approximation, 3e8 m/s is fine.\n\nSo:\n\n6.666666667 * 3e8 m/s = 2e9 m/s.\n\nMultiply by tau: 2e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\n2e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (2 * 2.056875) * 1e-15 = 4.11375e-15 m.\n\nHmm, so that's approximately 4.11375e-15 m. But the options are A:5.02e-16, B:4.065e-15, C:5.02e-15, D:4.06e-16.\n\nSo my calculation is 4.11e-15, which is close to option B (4.065e-15) but a bit higher.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.\n\nE_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nGamma = E/(m c\u00b2). So E is in GeV, m c\u00b2 is in GeV, so gamma is E/(m) =8/1.2 = 6.6666666667.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the precise value of \u0127 is important. I used 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Maybe the exact value is 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s, but perhaps a more precise calculation would adjust this.\n\nWait, let me compute the exact value of tau again.\n\nTau = \u0127 / (Gamma). So:\n\n\u0127 = 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\nTau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = let's compute this precisely.\n\n6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32 ) \u00d7 1e-25.\n\n6.582 \u00f7 0.32: Let's compute 6.582 / 0.32.\n\n0.32 \u00d7 20 = 6.4 \u2192 6.582-6.4=0.182.\n\n0.182 \u00f7 0.32 = 0.56875.\n\nSo 20.56875 \u2192 so 20.56875 \u00d7 1e-25 \u2192 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's compute L exactly:\n\nL = gamma * c * tau.\n\nGamma: 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666666666667.\n\nc: 2.99792458e8 m/s \u2192 perhaps using 2.9979e8 for more accurate calculation.\n\nSo:\n\n6.666666666666667 * 2.99792458e8 m/s = ?\n\nLet me compute 6.666666666666667 * 2.99792458e8.\n\n6.666666666666667 is 20/3.\n\n20/3 * 2.99792458e8 = (20 * 2.99792458e8) /3.\n\n20 * 2.99792458e8 = 5.99584916e9.\n\nDivide by 3: 5.99584916e9 /3 \u2248 1.998616387e9 m/s.\n\nSo velocity factor is approximately 1.9986e9 m/s.\n\nNow multiply by tau (2.056875e-24 s):\n\n1.998616387e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (1.998616387 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.\n\nCalculating 1.998616387 * 2.056875.\n\nApproximating:\n\n2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.\n\nBut 1.9986 is slightly less than 2, so 1.9986 * 2.056875 \u2248 4.11375 - (0.0014 * 2.056875) = 4.11375 - 0.00288 = ~4.11087.\n\nSo L \u2248 4.11087e-15 m.\n\nHmm, that's about 4.11e-15 meters. But the options are B:4.0655e-15 and C:5.02e-15. So my calculation is 4.11e-15, which is closer to B but not exactly matching. Did I make a mistake in the calculation somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I should use more precise values for \u0127 and c. Let me try that.\n\nThe value of \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. But perhaps more accurately, it's 6.5823 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nTau = 6.5823e-25 / 0.32 = (6.5823 / 0.32 )e-25 s.\n\n6.5823 / 0.32 = 20.5696875 \u2192 so tau is 20.5696875e-25 s = 2.05696875e-24 s.\n\nNow, gamma is 6.666666666666667.\n\nc is exactly 299792458 m/s.\n\nSo, gamma * c = 6.666666666666667 * 299792458 m/s.\n\nCompute this:\n\n6.666666666666667 is 20/3, so 20/3 * 299792458 = (20 * 299792458) /3.\n\n20 * 299,792,458 = 5,995,849,160.\n\nDivide by 3: 5,995,849,160 /3 = 1,998,616,386.666... m/s.\n\nSo gamma * c = 1,998,616,386.666 m/s.\n\nNow, multiply by tau: 1,998,616,386.666 m/s * 2.05696875e-24 s.\n\nSo 1,998,616,386.666 * 2.05696875e-24 = ?\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFirst, 1.998616386e9 m/s * 2.05696875e-24 s.\n\n1.998616386e9 * 2.05696875e-24 = (1.998616386 * 2.05696875) * 1e-15.\n\nCompute 1.998616386 * 2.05696875.\n\nLet me compute it precisely:\n\n1.998616386 * 2.05696875 = ?\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1.998616386 \u2248 2 - 0.001383614.\n\nSo, (2 - 0.001383614) * 2.05696875 = 2 * 2.05696875 - 0.001383614 * 2.05696875.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2 * 2.05696875 = 4.1139375.\n\n0.001383614 * 2.05696875 \u2248 0.002847.\n\nSo 4.1139375 - 0.002847 \u2248 4.1110905.\n\nSo, approximately 4.11109e-15 meters.\n\nHmm, that's 4.11109e-15 m, which is about 4.11e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA) 5.0223e-16 m \u2192 5e-16, which is smaller by a factor of about 8.\n\nB) 4.0655e-15 m \u2192 4.0655e-15.\n\nC) 5.0223e-15 m \u2192 5e-15.\n\nD)4.0655e-16 m \u2192 4e-16, much smaller.\n\nSo my calculation is about 4.11e-15, which is closer to option B (4.0655e-15). But why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Wait, let me think. The production energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, which is the total energy. So E = gamma m c\u00b2. So gamma is E / (m c\u00b2) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) ) = 6.6667, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the particle is produced, it's moving, so maybe the velocity isn't exactly c, but close. So perhaps I should compute beta instead of assuming v = c. Because when gamma is 6.6667, beta (v/c) is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) = sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2) ) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) )= sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So v is 0.9887c. So maybe I should use beta * c instead of c.\n\nAh, right! I think I made a mistake here. Because the meson's velocity isn't exactly c, it's beta * c. So the decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nOh, so I forgot to include the beta factor. That's a crucial mistake. So I have to correct that.\n\nSo the formula should be L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nSo let's recompute.\n\nGamma is 6.6667, so beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2) ))^2 )\n\nWait, gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.6667, so (1/gamma)^2 is (1/6.6667)^2 \u2248 (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nAlternatively, beta can be calculated as sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)) ) \u2192 but perhaps it's easier to compute as beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nSo beta \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nGamma is 6.6667, beta is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo:\n\nL = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCompute step by step.\n\nFirst, 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.6667 * 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute that: 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322; 0.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.6585. So total is about 5.9322 + 0.6585 = 6.5907.\n\nSo gamma * beta \u22486.5907.\n\nNow, multiply by c: 6.5907 * 3e8 m/s = 1.97721e9 m/s.\n\nNow, multiply by tau (2.056875e-24 s):\n\n1.97721e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (1.97721 * 2.056875 ) * 1e-15.\n\nCompute 1.97721 * 2.056875.\n\nApproximate:\n\n1.97721 * 2 = 3.95442.\n\n1.97721 * 0.056875 \u2248 0.1123.\n\nTotal \u22483.95442 + 0.1123 = 4.06672.\n\nSo L \u22484.06672e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.0667e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the formula for the decay length:\n\n\\[\nL = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor,\n- \\( \\beta = v/c \\) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light (\\( c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)),\n- \\( \\tau \\) is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\( \\gamma \\)\nThe Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) and \\( m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2 \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate \\( \\beta \\)\nThe velocity \\( \\beta \\) is related to \\( \\gamma \\) by:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\gamma = 6.6667 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{44.4444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \\sqrt{0.9775} \\approx 0.9887\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate \\( \\tau \\)\nThe mean lifetime \\( \\tau \\) is related to the decay width \\( \\Gamma_X \\) by:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( \\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) and \\( \\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{s} \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \\approx 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate \\( L \\)\nSubstituting \\( \\gamma = 6.6667 \\), \\( \\beta = 0.9887 \\), \\( c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\), and \\( \\tau = 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s} \\) into the formula for \\( L \\):\n\n\\[\nL = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau\n\\]\n\n\\[\nL = 6.6667 \\cdot 0.9887 \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8) \\cdot (2.056875 \\times 10^{-24})\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( \\gamma \\beta \\):\n\n\\[\n\\gamma \\beta = 6.6667 \\cdot 0.9887 \\approx 6.5907\n\\]\n\nThen, calculate \\( \\gamma \\beta c \\):\n\n\\[\n\\gamma \\beta c = 6.5907 \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8) \\approx 1.97721 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{m/s}\n\\]\n\nFinally, calculate \\( L \\):\n\n\\[\nL = 1.97721 \\times 10^9 \\cdot 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\approx 4.0667 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options\nThe calculated decay length \\( L \\approx 4.0667 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m} \\) is closest to option **B) \\( 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m} \\)**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.\n\nThe question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X as 320 MeV. They're asking for the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.\n\nWait, I remember that the decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay length L is given by L = \u03b3 * c * \u03c4, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and \u03c4 is the proper lifetime.\n\nBut how do I find \u03c4? I think \u03c4 is related to the width \u0393 through the uncertainty principle. The width \u0393 is the total decay width, which is connected to the mean lifetime by the relation \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, let me get the units right. Since \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s, I need to convert units properly.\n\nLet me jot down the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the Lorentz factor \u03b3.\n2. Find the proper lifetime \u03c4 using \u0393.\n3. Compute the mean lifetime as \u03b3 * \u03c4.\n4. Multiply by c to get the decay distance.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. The mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is \u03b3 * \u03c4, and the decay length is c multiplied by that. So L = \u03b3 * c * \u03c4.\n\nBut wait, the width \u0393 is in units of energy. I think the relation between \u0393 and \u03c4 is \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4, so \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut let me double-check. The natural line width is given by \u0393 = \u0127 * (\u0394f), where \u0394f is the uncertainty in the frequency. But for decay width, \u0393 is the total decay rate, so \u03c4 is the mean lifetime, and \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4. So yes, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure about the units. \u0127 is approximately 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Oh wait, no, let me get the value right. I think \u0127 is about 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7seconds. But wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is around 4.135667696\u00d710^-15 eV\u00b7s for \u0127, so converting that to GeV\u00b7s would be 4.135667696e-15 eV\u00b7s * (1 GeV / 1e9 eV) ) = 4.135667696e-24 GeV\u00b7s. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 1 eV is 1e-9 GeV. So 4.135667696e-15 eV\u00b7s = 4.135667696e-15 * 1e-9 GeV\u00b7s = 4.135667696e-24 GeV\u00b7s. Hmm, so \u0127 is approximately 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look it up mentally. Oh wait, I remember that \u0127 c is about 197 MeV\u00b7fm. But I think for this problem, we'll use \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use natural units where \u0127 = c = 1, but then I have to convert back to meters.\n\nWait, no, let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the Lorentz factor \u03b3.\n\nThe particle's energy E is given as 8 GeV, and its rest mass m is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. Wait, in units where c=1, E=\u03b3 m. So \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2) \u2192 but again, with c=1, \u03b3 = E/(m).\n\nSo \u03b3 = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... \u2248 6.6667.\n\nSo \u03b3 is about 6.6667.\n\nNext, compute the proper lifetime \u03c4. As I thought earlier, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So \u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nWait, but units matter. \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s, \u0393 is in GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32 ) s.\n\nCalculating that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 \u2192 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nSo \u03c4 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nNow, the lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 * \u03c4. So \u03b3 is 6.6667, so lab \u03c4 is 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s \u2248 ?\n\n6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 \u2192 Let me compute 2.056875e-24 * 6.6667.\n\nHmm, 2 * 6.6667 is about 13.3334, so 2e-24 *6.6667 is about 1.3333e-23.\n\nWait, but 2.056875 is 2 + 0.056875. So 6.6667 * 2 =13.3334e-24, and 6.6667 *0.056875 \u2248 0.3779e-24. So total is approx 13.3334e-24 + 0.3779e-24 = 13.7113e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate 6.6667 * 2.056875.\n\n6 * 2.056875 = 12.34125.\n\n0.6667 * 2.056875 \u2248 1.37125.\n\nSo total is 12.34125 + 1.37125 = 13.7125, so 13.7125e-24 seconds.\n\nSo lab frame lifetime \u03c4_lab = 1.37125e-23 seconds? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 13.7125e-24 is 1.37125e-23 seconds, yes.\n\nWait, no, 13.7125e-24 is 1.37125e-23.\n\nWait, 1e-23 is 0.1e-22, so 1.37e-23 is 1.37e-23 s.\n\nThen, the decay length L is c multiplied by \u03c4_lab.\n\nc is approximately 3e8 meters per second.\n\nSo L = c * \u03c4_lab = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nMultiply 3e8 by 1.37125e-23.\n\n3e8 is 3 * 1e8 = 3e8.\n\n3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = 3 * 1.37125 * 1e8 * 1e-23 = 4.11375e-15 meters.\n\nWait, 3 * 1.37125 is approximately 4.11375.\n\nSo L \u2248 4.11375e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15. Hmm, I got about 4.11e-15, but the closest option is B (4.0655e-15) or C.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nFirst, calculate \u03b3.\n\nE = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.\n\n\u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2) \u2192 but since c=1 in natural units, \u03b3 = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, calculate \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\n\u0127 is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s.\n\nCompute 6.582 / 0.32.\n\n0.32 * 20 = 6.4. 6.582 is 0.182 more than 6.4. So 0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875.\n\nSo 20.56875 \u2192 20.56875e-25 s \u2192 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 \u2192 20.56875 * 1e-25 \u2192 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, lab frame \u03c4 is \u03b3 * \u03c4 = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute that: 6.6666667 * 2.056875.\n\nLet me compute 2.056875 * 6 = 12.34125.\n\n2.056875 * 0.6666667 \u2248 1.37125.\n\nSo total is 12.34125 +1.37125 = 13.7125.\n\nSo 13.7125e-24 s \u2192 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nWait, no: 6.6666667 is 20/3. So 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) /3 ) e-24.\n\n20 *2.056875 = 41.1375.\n\nDivide by 3 \u2192 13.7125e-24 \u2192 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nThen, L = c * \u03c4_lab.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.\n\n3e8 *1.37125e-23 = 3 *1.37125 * 1e8 *1e-23.\n\n3 *1.37125 = 4.11375.\n\n1e8 *1e-23 = 1e-15.\n\nSo L = 4.11375e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.0223e-15.\n\nHmm, my calculation gives 4.11375e-15, but none of the options match exactly. The closest is B at 4.0655e-15. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation of \u0127. Let me recheck the value of \u0127.\n\nI thought \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Wait, but another source I remember says \u0127 \u2248 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps using natural units where \u0127 = 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate more precisely.\n\nLet me compute 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = ?\n\n0.32 *20 =6.4, which is 0.182 less than 6.582.\n\nSo 0.182 /0.32 = 0.56875.\n\nSo 20.56875 \u2192 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise value of \u0127. Let's see, \u0127 is approximately 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So that's precise enough.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the relation between \u0393 and \u03c4.\n\nWait, the relation is \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the width \u0393 is given in MeV, not GeV. So 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV, correct.\n\nWait, but in the calculation, perhaps I should use \u0393 in GeV. Let me double-check.\n\nYes, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So correct.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the decay width is given as the total width, which is related to the lifetime via \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the velocity is a factor? Oh, wait, in the decay length, it's L = \u03b3 c \u03c4. But wait, that's the same as what I did.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for the decay length.\n\nThe formula is L = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2 \u03b3, where \u03b2 is v/c.\n\nWait, because \u03c4 is the proper lifetime, and the lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4, and velocity is v = \u03b2 c. So L = v * (\u03b3 \u03c4) ) = \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nWait, wait, wait. So L = v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame. t = \u03b3 \u03c4. So L = v * \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nv is beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau.\n\nWait, but earlier I computed L as c * gamma tau, which is same as beta c gamma tau only if beta is 1. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake here.\n\nAh, that's a big mistake. So I should have included beta in the calculation.\n\nWait, so let's correct that.\n\nThe decay length is L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nSo I missed the beta factor earlier.\n\nSo I need to calculate beta.\n\nBeta is v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)).\n\nBecause \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2).\n\nSo beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(\u03b3\u00b2)).\n\nGiven that gamma is 6.6667, let's compute beta.\n\ngamma^2 is (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u224844.4444.\n\nSo 1/(gamma^2) = 9/400 = 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - 1/(gamma^2) = 0.9775.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nApproximately 0.9887.\n\nSo beta \u22480.9887.\n\nSo then, L = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nEarlier, I computed c * gamma tau as 4.11375e-15 m, but I forgot to multiply by beta.\n\nSo now, L = 0.9887 * 4.11375e-15 m.\n\nCompute that: 4.11375e-15 * 0.9887 \u2248 ?\n\nWell, 4.11375 * 0.9887 \u22484.065.\n\nSo 4.065e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that matches.\n\nAh! So that was the missing piece. I forgot to include beta in the calculation.\n\nSo the correct decay length is approximately 4.065e-15 meters, which is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.\n\nThe question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X as 320 MeV. They're asking for the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.\n\nWait, I remember that the decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay length L is given by L = \u03b3 * c * \u03c4, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and \u03c4 is the proper lifetime.\n\nBut how do I find \u03c4? I think \u03c4 is related to the width \u0393 through the uncertainty principle. The width \u0393 is the total decay width, which is connected to the mean lifetime by the relation \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, let me get the units right. Since \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s, I need to convert units properly.\n\nLet me jot down the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the Lorentz factor \u03b3.\n2. Find the proper lifetime \u03c4 using \u0393.\n3. Compute the mean lifetime as \u03b3 * \u03c4.\n4. Multiply by c to get the decay distance.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. The mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is \u03b3 * \u03c4, and the decay length is c multiplied by that. So L = \u03b3 * c * \u03c4.\n\nBut wait, the width \u0393 is in units of energy. I think the relation between \u0393 and \u03c4 is \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4, so \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut let me double-check. The natural line width is given by \u0393 = \u0127 * (\u0394f), where \u0394f is the uncertainty in the frequency. But for decay width, \u0393 is the total decay rate, so \u03c4 is the mean lifetime, and \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4. So yes, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure about the units. \u0127 is approximately 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Oh wait, no, let me get the value right. I think \u0127 is about 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7seconds. But wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is around 4.135667696\u00d710^-15 eV\u00b7s for \u0127, so converting that to GeV\u00b7s would be 4.135667696e-15 eV\u00b7s * (1 GeV / 1e9 eV) ) = 4.135667696e-24 GeV\u00b7s. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 1 eV is 1e-9 GeV. So 4.135667696e-15 eV\u00b7s = 4.135667696e-15 * 1e-9 GeV\u00b7s = 4.135667696e-24 GeV\u00b7s. Hmm, so \u0127 is approximately 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look it up mentally. Oh wait, I remember that \u0127 c is about 197 MeV\u00b7fm. But I think for this problem, we'll use \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use natural units where \u0127 = c = 1, but then I have to convert back to meters.\n\nWait, no, let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the Lorentz factor \u03b3.\n\nThe particle's energy E is given as 8 GeV, and its rest mass m is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. Wait, in units where c=1, E=\u03b3 m. So \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2) \u2192 but again, with c=1, \u03b3 = E/(m).\n\nSo \u03b3 = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... \u2248 6.6667.\n\nSo \u03b3 is about 6.6667.\n\nNext, compute the proper lifetime \u03c4. As I thought earlier, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So \u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nWait, but units matter. \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s, \u0393 is in GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32 ) s.\n\nCalculating that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 \u2192 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nSo \u03c4 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nNow, the lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 * \u03c4. So \u03b3 is 6.6667, so lab \u03c4 is 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s \u2248 ?\n\n6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 \u2192 Let me compute 2.056875e-24 * 6.6667.\n\nHmm, 2 * 6.6667 is about 13.3334, so 2e-24 *6.6667 is about 1.3333e-23.\n\nWait, but 2.056875 is 2 + 0.056875. So 6.6667 * 2 =13.3334e-24, and 6.6667 *0.056875 \u2248 0.3779e-24. So total is approx 13.3334e-24 + 0.3779e-24 = 13.7113e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate 6.6667 * 2.056875.\n\n6 * 2.056875 = 12.34125.\n\n0.6667 * 2.056875 \u2248 1.37125.\n\nSo total is 12.34125 + 1.37125 = 13.7125, so 13.7125e-24 seconds.\n\nSo lab frame lifetime \u03c4_lab = 1.37125e-23 seconds? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 13.7125e-24 is 1.37125e-23 seconds, yes.\n\nWait, no, 13.7125e-24 is 1.37125e-23.\n\nWait, 1e-23 is 0.1e-22, so 1.37e-23 is 1.37e-23 s.\n\nThen, the decay length L is c multiplied by \u03c4_lab.\n\nc is approximately 3e8 meters per second.\n\nSo L = c * \u03c4_lab = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nMultiply 3e8 by 1.37125e-23.\n\n3e8 is 3 * 1e8 = 3e8.\n\n3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = 3 * 1.37125 * 1e8 * 1e-23 = 4.11375e-15 meters.\n\nWait, 3 * 1.37125 is approximately 4.11375.\n\nSo L \u2248 4.11375e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15. Hmm, I got about 4.11e-15, but the closest option is B (4.0655e-15) or C.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nFirst, calculate \u03b3.\n\nE = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.\n\n\u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2) \u2192 but since c=1 in natural units, \u03b3 = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, calculate \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\n\u0127 is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s.\n\nCompute 6.582 / 0.32.\n\n0.32 * 20 = 6.4. 6.582 is 0.182 more than 6.4. So 0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875.\n\nSo 20.56875 \u2192 20.56875e-25 s \u2192 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 \u2192 20.56875 * 1e-25 \u2192 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, lab frame \u03c4 is \u03b3 * \u03c4 = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute that: 6.6666667 * 2.056875.\n\nLet me compute 2.056875 * 6 = 12.34125.\n\n2.056875 * 0.6666667 \u2248 1.37125.\n\nSo total is 12.34125 +1.37125 = 13.7125.\n\nSo 13.7125e-24 s \u2192 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nWait, no: 6.6666667 is 20/3. So 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) /3 ) e-24.\n\n20 *2.056875 = 41.1375.\n\nDivide by 3 \u2192 13.7125e-24 \u2192 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nThen, L = c * \u03c4_lab.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.\n\n3e8 *1.37125e-23 = 3 *1.37125 * 1e8 *1e-23.\n\n3 *1.37125 = 4.11375.\n\n1e8 *1e-23 = 1e-15.\n\nSo L = 4.11375e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.0223e-15.\n\nHmm, my calculation gives 4.11375e-15, but none of the options match exactly. The closest is B at 4.0655e-15. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation of \u0127. Let me recheck the value of \u0127.\n\nI thought \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Wait, but another source I remember says \u0127 \u2248 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps using natural units where \u0127 = 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate more precisely.\n\nLet me compute 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = ?\n\n0.32 *20 =6.4, which is 0.182 less than 6.582.\n\nSo 0.182 /0.32 = 0.56875.\n\nSo 20.56875 \u2192 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise value of \u0127. Let's see, \u0127 is approximately 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So that's precise enough.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the relation between \u0393 and \u03c4.\n\nWait, the relation is \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the width \u0393 is given in MeV, not GeV. So 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV, correct.\n\nWait, but in the calculation, perhaps I should use \u0393 in GeV. Let me double-check.\n\nYes, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So correct.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the decay width is given as the total width, which is related to the lifetime via \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the velocity is a factor? Oh, wait, in the decay length, it's L = \u03b3 c \u03c4. But wait, that's the same as what I did.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for the decay length.\n\nThe formula is L = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2 \u03b3, where \u03b2 is v/c.\n\nWait, because \u03c4 is the proper lifetime, and the lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4, and velocity is v = \u03b2 c. So L = v * (\u03b3 \u03c4) ) = \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nWait, wait, wait. So L = v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame. t = \u03b3 \u03c4. So L = v * \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nv is beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau.\n\nWait, but earlier I computed L as c * gamma tau, which is same as beta c gamma tau only if beta is 1. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake here.\n\nAh, that's a big mistake. So I should have included beta in the calculation.\n\nWait, so let's correct that.\n\nThe decay length is L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nSo I missed the beta factor earlier.\n\nSo I need to calculate beta.\n\nBeta is v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)).\n\nBecause \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2).\n\nSo beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(\u03b3\u00b2)).\n\nGiven that gamma is 6.6667, let's compute beta.\n\ngamma^2 is (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u224844.4444.\n\nSo 1/(gamma^2) = 9/400 = 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - 1/(gamma^2) = 0.9775.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nApproximately 0.9887.\n\nSo beta \u22480.9887.\n\nSo then, L = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nEarlier, I computed c * gamma tau as 4.11375e-15 m, but I forgot to multiply by beta.\n\nSo now, L = 0.9887 * 4.11375e-15 m.\n\nCompute that: 4.11375e-15 * 0.9887 \u2248 ?\n\nWell, 4.11375 * 0.9887 \u22484.065.\n\nSo 4.065e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that matches.\n\nAh! So that was the missing piece. I forgot to include beta in the calculation.\n\nSo the correct decay length is approximately 4.065e-15 meters, which is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance \\( L \\) of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nL = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\beta = v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} \\),\n- \\( \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} \\),\n- \\( \\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} \\),\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light,\n- \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck constant,\n- \\( E \\), \\( m \\), and \\( \\Gamma \\) are the production energy, mass, and decay width of the particle, respectively.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\( \\gamma \\)\nThe Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( E = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) and \\( m = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate \\( \\beta \\)\nThe velocity factor \\( \\beta \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\gamma = 6.6667 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\gamma^2 = \\left(\\frac{8}{1.2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{64}{1.44} \\approx 44.4444, \\quad \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} = \\frac{1}{44.4444} \\approx 0.0225\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \\sqrt{0.9775} \\approx 0.9887\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate \\( \\tau \\)\nThe proper lifetime \\( \\tau \\) is related to the decay width \\( \\Gamma \\) by:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( \\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s} \\) and \\( \\Gamma = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \\approx 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate \\( L \\)\nThe mean decay distance \\( L \\) is:\n\n\\[\nL = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\beta \\approx 0.9887 \\), \\( \\gamma = 6.6667 \\), \\( c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\), and \\( \\tau \\approx 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s} \\):\n\n\\[\nL = 0.9887 \\cdot 6.6667 \\cdot 3 \\times 10^8 \\cdot 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( \\gamma \\tau \\):\n\n\\[\n\\gamma \\tau = 6.6667 \\cdot 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\approx 1.37125 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\nThen, calculate \\( c \\cdot \\gamma \\tau \\):\n\n\\[\nc \\cdot \\gamma \\tau = 3 \\times 10^8 \\cdot 1.37125 \\times 10^{-23} \\approx 4.11375 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nFinally, include \\( \\beta \\):\n\n\\[\nL = 0.9887 \\cdot 4.11375 \\times 10^{-15} \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe mean decay distance is approximately \\( 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m} \\), which corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. So, the question says X is a meson resonance, and we need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various values in meters.\n\nWait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula should be something like distance = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2, where \u03c4 is the mean lifetime, c is the speed of light, and \u03b2 is the velocity in units of c. But how do I find \u03c4 from the given parameters?\n\nOh, right! The width \u0393 is related to the lifetime \u03c4. The uncertainty principle tells us that \u0393 \u2248 \u0127/\u03c4, so \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, I need to make sure about the units here. \u0393 is given in MeV, and I think I should convert that to energy units compatible with \u0127. \n\nWait, \u0127 has units of GeV\u00b7s, right? Because the Planck constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s, and \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0), so same units. But 1 GeV is 1.602 x 10^-10 J. Hmm, maybe I can express \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s terms. I think \u0127 is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, that's the value I remember. \n\nSo, \u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, \u0393 = 0.32 GeV. Therefore, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. Let me plug in the numbers: 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s divided by 0.32 GeV. That should give me \u03c4 in seconds. Let me compute that. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is roughly 2.056875e-24 seconds. So, \u03c4 \u2248 2.057e-24 s.\n\nNext, I need to find the velocity \u03b2. \u03b2 is v/c. How do I find that? I think it's related to the energy and mass of the particle. The energy E is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So, the total energy is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. So, \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2). Wait, but E is already given in GeV and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, because E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2 implies that E in GeV equals \u03b3 m (in GeV/c\u00b2) times c\u00b2. Wait, maybe I should calculate gamma as E / m. Because E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). But since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, let's see. Let me think in terms of units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation between energy, mass, and velocity. The relativistic energy is E\u00b2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. So, p is the momentum, which is gamma m v. So, perhaps I can find the velocity from that.\n\nAlternatively, beta can be found using beta = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)). Let me write that as beta = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E^2)). Wait, but E is the total energy, so yes, that should work. Let's plug in the numbers.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So, m^2 c^4 would be (1.2)^2 (GeV\u00b2/c^4) * c^4 \u2192 (1.44 GeV\u00b2). E squared is (8)^2 =64 GeV\u00b2. So, m\u00b2 c^4 / E\u00b2 = (1.44)/(64) = 0.0225. Then 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So, beta is about 0.9887. So, \u03b2 \u2248 0.9887.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.9775 under square root. Let me think. 0.988 squared is 0.976144. 0.989 squared is 0.978121. Hmm, 0.9775 is between them. Let me compute 0.9887^2: (0.988)^2 is 0.976144. 0.9887 is 0.988 + 0.0007. So, (0.988 + 0.0007)^2 = 0.988\u00b2 + 2*0.988*0.0007 + (0.0007)^2. That's 0.976144 + 0.0013832 + 0.00000049 \u2248 0.9775277. Oh, very close to 0.9775. So, sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So, beta is about 0.9887. So, v \u2248 0.9887 c.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the mean decay distance is c * \u03c4 * beta. So, let's compute that.\n\nc is approximately 3e8 m/s. \u03c4 is 2.057e-24 s. beta is 0.9887.\n\nSo, distance = c * \u03c4 * beta \u2248 (3e8 m/s) * (2.057e-24 s) * 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute this step by step. First, multiply c and tau: 3e8 * 2.057e-24 = 3 * 2.057e-16 = 6.171e-16 m. Then multiply by beta: 6.171e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.105e-16 m.\n\nWait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 range. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating tau. Let me double-check that. Gamma is 0.32 GeV. So, tau is \u0127 / Gamma. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6.582e-25 / 0.32. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So, 20.56875e-25 \u2192 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the decay width is given in MeV, and I converted it correctly to GeV. Yes, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So that part is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta. Let me re-calculate that. Beta squared is 1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E^2). Wait, but in units where c=1, E and m have units GeV and GeV/c\u00b2. Hmm, perhaps I should express everything in terms of c=1, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2. So, (pc)^2 = E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2. Then, p = sqrt( (E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4) ) / c. Then, beta = v/c = p c / E. So, beta = [sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4)] / E.\n\nWait, because p = gamma m v. And beta = v/c. So, p c = gamma m v c = gamma m c\u00b2 beta. Hmm, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, let me express beta as (p c)/E. Because E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 ), so E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + m\u00b2 c^4 ). Then, (pc) = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4). So, beta = (sqrt(E\u00b2 - m^2 c^4 )) / (c E) ) * c. Wait, maybe that's not right. Wait, beta is v/c, so beta = (v) / c. And from p = gamma m v, so v = p c\u00b2/(gamma m c) )? Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute beta as sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)) ? Wait, no, perhaps I should write beta as sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) )? Wait, when E is in energy units, and m is in mass units (GeV/c\u00b2), then E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2. So, (pc)^2 = E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2. Then, p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2) / c.\n\nThen, since p = gamma m v, and gamma = E/(m c\u00b2), then v = (p c)/(gamma m). Substituting p, we get v = [ sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2) / c ] * c / (gamma m ). Simplify: v = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc^2)^2 ) / (gamma m ). But gamma is E/(m c\u00b2), so gamma m = E/(c\u00b2). So, v = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m^2 c^4)) / (E/(c\u00b2) )) \u2192 v = c\u00b2 sqrt( (E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4) ) / E.\n\nWait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Alternatively, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)). Because E = gamma m c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = E/(m c\u00b2). So, gamma = E/(m c\u00b2). Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ) \u2192 sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nYes, that's correct. So, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nWait, but m is in GeV/c\u00b2, and E is in GeV. So, m c\u00b2 is GeV. So, (m c\u00b2)^2 is (GeV)^2, and E is GeV, so E squared is (GeV)^2. So, the ratio is (m c\u00b2)^2 / E^2 = (1.2 GeV)^2 / (8 GeV)^2 = (1.44)/(64) = 0.0225. So, 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root is about 0.9887, as before. So, beta is correct.\n\nSo, back to distance: c * tau * beta. c is 3e8 m/s. tau is 2.057e-24 s. beta is ~0.9887.\n\nSo, distance \u2248 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s * 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute 3e8 * 2.057e-24 = 6.171e-16 meters. Then multiply by 0.9887: 6.171e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.104e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but the options are A) 5.0223e-16 m, B)4.0655e-15 m, etc. Hmm, my calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m, which isn't among the options. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me double-check the beta calculation.\n\nE =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So, (m c^2) = 1.2 GeV. E =8 GeV. So, (m c^2)^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2. E\u00b2 =64 (GeV)^2. So, (m c^2)^2 / E\u00b2 = 1.44/64 = 0.0225. 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root is about 0.9887, which I think is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating tau. Let me check that again. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, tau = \u0127 / Gamma. \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6.582e-25 / 0.32. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So, 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24 s. That seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for decay length isn't just c * tau * beta. Maybe I'm missing a factor. Oh wait! The decay length is c multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau) multiplied by beta. So, L = c * tau * beta. Hmm, that's what I used.\n\nWait, but in some cases, when the particle is moving, the lifetime is dilated. So, the mean lifetime is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. Oh wait, no, the mean lifetime is tau = tau_0 * gamma, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. But in our case, tau is already the mean lifetime, so perhaps I don't need to adjust anything else.\n\nWait, no, because the tau we have is the mean lifetime, which is gamma times the proper lifetime. So, when calculating the decay length, we have L = v * tau. But v is beta c. So, L = beta c tau. Which is what I did.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the energy E is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh! Oh wait, that's a possibility. The question says production energy is 8 GeV. Is that the kinetic energy or the total energy? Because that would change things. If E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be E_total = K + m c^2. But if E is the total energy, then I was correct. \n\nLooking back at the question: it says production energy is 8 GeV. In particle physics, production energy usually refers to the total energy of the particle, not just the kinetic. So I think I was correct to use E as the total energy.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me try an alternative approach. Let me compute gamma first. Gamma = E/(m c^2) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8/1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nThen, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), so 1 - beta^2 = 1/(gamma^2) = 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) = (1.2^2)/(8^2) )= 1.44/64 = 0.0225. So, beta^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775, beta = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. Same result as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of \u0127. Let me check the value of \u0127. I thought it's approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Let me verify that. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. Then \u0127 = h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. To convert to GeV\u00b7s, since 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J, then 1 J = 1/(1.602e-10) GeV. So, 1 J\u00b7s = (1 GeV)/(1.602e-10) ) s. Therefore, \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s is 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 GeV)/(1.602e-10 J) ) \u2192 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-10 \u2248 6.586e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, my value was correct.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is that I should use the width in the denominator as Gamma = 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, tau = \u0127 / Gamma \u2192 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the decay length more accurately. Let me compute each part step by step.\n\nCompute c * tau: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s \u2192 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen, multiply by beta (0.9887): 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2192 let me compute that. 6.170625 * 0.9887 \u2248 approximately 6.104e-16 m.\n\nHmm, but the options are A)5.02e-16, C)5.02e-15, etc. So none match. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of beta? Or perhaps I forgot to account for something else?\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the decay width is given as \u0393 = 320 MeV, which is the total width, and the mean lifetime is tau = \u0127 / (Gamma). But wait, in some conventions, the width is Gamma = \u0127 / tau, so tau = \u0127 / Gamma. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me compute beta^2 again. m is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV. So, (m c^2)^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44. E^2 is 64. So, 1.44/64 = 0.0225. 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root is approximately 0.9887. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the relativistic relation involving the velocity. Let me think again about the decay length formula. Decay length L = c * tau * beta. So, L = c * (\u0127 / Gamma) * beta. Let me express everything in terms of \u0127 c.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can write it as L = (c * \u0127 / Gamma) * beta. Let me plug in the numbers: c is 3e8 m/s, \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, Gamma is 0.32 GeV. So, 3e8 * 6.582e-25 / 0.32 \u2192 3e8 * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) \u2192 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 \u2192 6.1706e-16 m. Then multiply by beta (0.9887) \u2192 ~6.104e-16 m. Still not matching any options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately. 0.9887^2 is 0.97752, which is very close to 0.9775. So, beta is 0.9887.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the units. Let me recheck the units for \u0127. \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s is approximately 6.582e-25. So, when I compute tau = \u0127 / Gamma, the units are (GeV\u00b7s) / GeV = s. Correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the error is elsewhere. Let me think about the problem again. The decay length is L = c * tau * beta. So, perhaps I should express everything in natural units to see if that helps.\n\nIn natural units, c=1, \u0127=1. So, tau = \u0127 / Gamma \u2192 1 / Gamma. But Gamma is given in GeV, so 0.32 GeV. So, tau in natural units is 1 / 0.32 \u2248 3.125. But to convert to seconds, since \u0127 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, so tau in seconds is (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the decay length in natural units and then convert. So, L in natural units is (tau) * beta. So, 3.125 * 0.9887 \u2248 3.090. Then, convert to meters. Natural unit conversion: 1 (natural unit length) = 197.3 MeV^-1 \u2248 1.973e-16 m (since 1 MeV^-1 is 1.973e-16 m). Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 GeV^-1 is 1.973e-16 m * (1 GeV/1 MeV) ) \u2192 197.3 MeV^-1 = 1.973e-16 m \u2192 so 1 GeV^-1 is (1.973e-16 m) * (1 MeV/1 GeV) ) \u2192 1.973e-16 * 1e-3 = 1.973e-19 m. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, 1 meter is about 5.07e+15 GeV^-1. Because 1 m = 1.973e-16 m\u00b7GeV \u2192 So, 1 GeV^-1 = (1.973e-16 m) * (1 GeV) ) \u2192 Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the conversion factor.\n\nThe conversion factor from natural units (GeV^-1) to meters is 197.327 MeV^-1 = 1.97327e-16 m. So, 1 GeV^-1 = 0.197327e-15 m.\n\nWait, 1 MeV^-1 is 1.973e-16 m. So, 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV, so 1 GeV^-1 = (1e-3) MeV^-1. So, 1 GeV^-1 = 1.973e-19 m.\n\nSo, L in natural units is 3.090 GeV^-1. To convert to meters: 3.090 * 1.973e-19 m. Let me compute that.\n\n3.090 * 1.973e-19 \u2248 6.10e-19 m? No, wait, 3.09 * 1.973 is about 6.104, so 6.104e-19 m. Wait, that's way smaller than the options, which are ~e-15 or e-16. Hmm, that can't be right. So, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion.\n\nWait, no, in natural units, L = c * tau * beta. But perhaps I should have L = tau * beta in natural units, since c=1. So, tau in natural units is 1 / (Gamma in GeV) \u2192 1 / 0.32 \u22483.125 GeV^-1. Multiply by beta (0.9887) \u2192 3.125 *0.9887 \u22483.09 GeV^-1. Then, 1 GeV^-1 is 1.973e-16 m * (1 GeV/1 MeV) ) \u2192 wait, no, 1 GeV^-1 is 1.973e-16 m / 1000 \u2192 1.973e-19 m.\n\nWait, so 3.09 GeV^-1 = 3.09 * 1.973e-19 m \u22486.10e-19 m. That's way smaller than the options. So, I must have done something wrong.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I messed up the natural unit conversion. Let me think again. 1 GeV^-1 equals 197.3 MeV^-1. Since 1 MeV^-1 is 1.973e-16 m, then 1 GeV^-1 = 197.3e-3 * 1.973e-16 m. Wait, no: 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV \u2192 1 GeV^-1 = 1e-3 MeV^-1. So, 1 GeV^-1 = 1e-3 * 1.973e-16 m = 1.973e-19 m. So, 3.09 GeV^-1 is 3.09 * 1.973e-19 \u2248 6.10e-19 m. Which is way smaller than the options. So, I must have a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the answer isn't among the options, which suggests that I made a mistake in the initial approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Let me think of another way.\n\nWait, another approach: The mean path length is given by L = c * tau * beta. So, if I can compute tau and beta correctly, I can find L.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma. Gamma is 0.32 GeV. So, tau = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nBeta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) \u2192 sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) \u2192 sqrt(1 - 0.0225) \u2192 sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo, L = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.9887 \u2192 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.1706e-16 m. Multiply by 0.9887 \u2192 6.104e-16 m.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have this. The closest is option A:5.0223e-16, which is about 0.82 times my result. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate beta more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) precisely.\n\n0.9887^2 = 0.97752. That's very close to 0.9775. So, beta is approximately 0.9887.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise values for \u0127. Let's take \u0127 as 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 \u2192 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approximation for beta. Let me compute beta using more precise numbers.\n\nE =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.\n\nE\u00b2 =64, m\u00b2=1.44.\n\nSo, m\u00b2/(E\u00b2) = 0.0225.\n\nSo, 1 - m\u00b2/E\u00b2 = 0.9775.\n\nWhat's the square root of 0.9775? Let me compute it accurately.\n\nLet me compute 0.9887^2 \u2192 0.97752. So, 0.9887^2 =0.97752. So, 0.9775 is slightly less than that, so beta is a bit less than 0.9887. Let me compute 0.9887^2 =0.97752. We have 0.9775, which is 0.9775 = 0.97752 - 0.00002. So, it's 0.9887 - delta, where delta is small.\n\nLet me compute delta. Let x=0.9887 - delta. Then x^2 = (0.9887 - delta)^2 \u2248 0.97752 - 2*0.9887*delta = 0.9775. So,\n\n0.97752 - 2 * 0.9887 * delta = 0.9775.\n\nSo, 2 * 0.9887 * delta = 0.00002.\n\ndelta = 0.00002/(2 * 0.9887) \u2248 0.000010115.\n\nSo, beta \u2248 0.9887 - 0.000010115 \u2248 0.988689885.\n\nSo, approximately 0.98869.\n\nSo, beta is about 0.98869.\n\nSo, when I compute L = c * tau * beta, let's see:\n\nc =3e8 m/s, tau=2.056875e-24 s, beta=0.98869.\n\nSo, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 0.98869: 6.170625e-16 * 0.98869 \u2248 6.103e-16 m.\n\nStill not matching any options. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, which is an order of magnitude higher than my result. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the decay width is given in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a different formula. Let me think: The decay length can also be calculated using the formula L = (c * \u0127) / (Gamma) * beta. Because L = c * tau * beta, and tau = \u0127/(Gamma), so L = c * \u0127 * beta / Gamma.\n\nSo, let's compute that. c is 3e8 m/s, \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV s, Gamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, (c * \u0127) / Gamma = (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) \u2192 3e8 * 6.582e-25 /0.32.\n\nCompute that: 3e8 * 6.582e-25 = 1.9746e-16. Divide by 0.32: 1.9746e-16 / 0.32 =6.1706e-16 m. Then multiply by beta (0.98869): 6.1706e-16 * 0.98869 \u22486.104e-16 m. Same result as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that I'm using E as the total energy, but maybe it's the kinetic energy. Let me recalculate beta assuming E is the kinetic energy.\n\nIf E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy E_total = K + m c^2 =8 GeV +1.2 GeV=9.2 GeV.\n\nThen, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E_total^2)).\n\nSo, (m c^2)^2 = (1.2)^2 =1.44. E_total^2 = (9.2)^2=84.64.\n\nSo, (m c^2)^2 / E_total^2 =1.44/84.64\u22480.017004. 1-0.017004=0.982996. Square root is approximately 0.99145.\n\nSo, beta is about 0.99145.\n\nThen, L =c * tau * beta \u2192 3e8 *2.056875e-24 *0.99145 \u2192 3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.1706e-16 m. Multiply by 0.99145 \u21926.11e-16 m. Still not matching.\n\nHmm, but the options are either around 4e-15 or 5e-16. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the width is given as the full width at half maximum (FWHM), but I think the formula uses the same Gamma. I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the relation L = (c * \u0127) * beta / (Gamma). Which is what I did.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is using the natural unit conversion differently. Let me think again about the unit conversion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula L = (c * \u0127) * beta / (Gamma * c), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is L = (c * \u0127 * beta) / (Gamma * m), but I don't think that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the mean decay distance is given by L = (c * tau) * beta. So, that's what I've done.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So, perhaps I should use 0.32 GeV as Gamma. Which I did.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption A:5.0223e-16 m.\n\nOption C:5.0223e-15 m.\n\nWait, my calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m. None of the options match. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for velocity. Let me compute gamma again.\n\nGamma = E/(m c^2) \u2192 E is 8 GeV, m c^2 is 1.2 GeV. So, gamma =8/1.2\u22486.6667.\n\nThen, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) \u2192 sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444))) ) \u2192 sqrt(1 -0.0225) \u2192 sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887. So, same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question has a typo and the options are wrong. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using a different approach.\n\nWait, another formula: The mean decay length can be expressed as L = (c * \u0127 * beta) / (Gamma). So, L = (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) * beta / (0.32 GeV).\n\nSo, 3e8 *6.582e-25 = 1.9746e-16. Divide by 0.32: 6.1706e-16. Multiply by beta (0.9887): 6.104e-16 m.\n\nHmm, same result. So, perhaps I should check the options again. Are there any options close to 6e-16? No. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the production energy is the energy in the lab frame, and perhaps I should calculate the velocity differently. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is given in GeV/c\u00b2, so when I compute E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, the units should be consistent.\n\nWait, let's try expressing everything in terms of GeV and c=1.\n\nE =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So, E\u00b2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 \u2192 (p c)^2 = E\u00b2 - m^2 c^4 \u2192 (p c)^2 =64 -1.44 \u219262.56. So, p c = sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.\n\nSo, p =7.91 GeV / c.\n\nThen, beta = v/c = (p c)/(E) \u2192 (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) )=0.98875. So, beta is 0.98875.\n\nWait, so using this approach, beta is approximately 0.98875. So, that's the same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me compute the velocity v = beta c =0.98875 c.\n\nThen, the time dilation factor gamma is E/(m c^2) =8/(1.2)=6.6667.\n\nThen, the lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. So, tau_0 = \u0127 / (Gamma) \u2192 6.582e-25 GeV s /0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. The mean lifetime is tau = \u0127 / Gamma, which is already in the lab frame. So, tau =2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo, the decay length is L = v * tau = beta c tau =0.98875 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCompute that: 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 =6.1706e-16 m. Multiply by 0.98875 \u21926.104e-16 m. Same as before.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are A:5.02e-16, B:4.0655e-15, C:5.02e-15, D:4.0655e-16.\n\nWait, option D is 4.0655e-16 m. Which is about 0.666 times my result. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.\n\nWait, let me compute beta more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) using a calculator approach.\n\nI can use the binomial expansion for sqrt(1 - x), where x is small. So, sqrt(1 -x) \u22481 -x/2 -x^2/8 - ... For x=0.0225, which is not very small, but perhaps this can give a better approximation.\n\nSo, sqrt(0.9775) = sqrt(1 -0.0225)=1 -0.0225/2 - (0.0225)^2/(8) - ... \u21921 -0.01125 - (0.00050625)/8 \u21921 -0.01125 -0.00006328125\u22480.98868671875.\n\nSo, beta \u22480.98868671875.\n\nNow, compute L =3e8 *2.056875e-24 *0.98868671875.\n\nCompute 3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 0.98868671875: 6.170625e-16 *0.98868671875.\n\nLet me compute this: 6.170625 * 0.98868671875 \u22486.103e-16 m.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think about the formula again. Decay length L = c * tau * beta.\n\nAnother approach: Let me compute using the natural unit conversion factor.\n\nIn natural units, c=1, \u0127=1, and the conversion from GeV^-1 to meters is 197.327 MeV^-1 = 1.97327e-16 m. So, 1 GeV^-1 = 0.197327e-15 m.\n\nSo, L in natural units is (tau) * beta. Tau is \u0127 / Gamma \u2192 1 / 0.32 GeV \u22483.125 GeV^-1.\n\nSo, L =3.125 *0.9887 \u22483.09 GeV^-1.\n\nConvert to meters: 3.09 GeV^-1 * 0.197327e-15 m/GeV^-1 \u21923.09 *0.197327e-15 \u2192 6.103e-16 m. Again, same result.\n\nHmm, I'm not seeing any error in my calculations. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that can't be, so I must have missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the width in MeV without converting to GeV. Let me try that.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV =0.32 GeV, so that's correct. Wait, no, perhaps I should keep Gamma in MeV and adjust the units accordingly. Let me try that.\n\nSo, tau = \u0127 / Gamma. But \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Gamma is 320 MeV =0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, tau =6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV =2.056875e-24 s. Same as before.\n\nHmm, same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for \u0127. Let me try using \u0127=6.58e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Let's see.\n\nTau =6.58e-25 /0.32 =2.05625e-24 s.\n\nThen, L=3e8 *2.05625e-24 *0.9887 \u2192 3e8 *2.05625e-24 =6.16875e-16 m. Multiply by 0.9887 \u21926.103e-16 m.\n\nStill same result.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me think about the possible answers. The options are:\n\nA)5.0223e-16 m\n\nB)4.0655e-15 m\n\nC)5.0223e-15 m\n\nD)4.0655e-16 m\n\nIf I take my result of 6.103e-16 m and compare to the options, perhaps the closest is option A (5.02e-16), which is about 80% of my result. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta, but I can't see where.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the decay width as Gamma = 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, but perhaps the formula uses Gamma in units of GeV. So, tau = \u0127 / Gamma \u2192 6.582e-25 / 0.32 =2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of beta. Let me compute beta using more precise numbers.\n\nCompute beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nm=1.2 GeV/c\u00b2, E=8 GeV.\n\nSo, (m c^2)^2 = (1.2)^2 =1.44.\n\nE^2 =8^2=64.\n\nSo, (m c^2)^2 /E^2 =1.44/64=0.0225.\n\nSo, 1-0.0225=0.9775.\n\nThe square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) using a calculator.\n\n0.9887^2=0.97752.\n\nSo, 0.9775 is 0.97752 -0.00002. So, let me use the linear approximation.\n\nsqrt(0.9775) = sqrt(0.97752 -0.00002) \u2248 sqrt(0.97752) - (0.00002)/(2 * sqrt(0.97752)).\n\nWhich is approximately 0.9887 - (0.00002)/(2 * 0.9887) \u2192 0.9887 - (1e-5)/0.9887 \u2248 0.9887 - 1.0115e-5 \u22480.988698885.\n\nSo, beta is approximately 0.988698885.\n\nNow, compute L =3e8 *2.056875e-24 *0.988698885.\n\n3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 0.988698885 \u21926.170625e-16 *0.988698885 \u22486.103e-16 m.\n\nStill the same.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider that the width is given in MeV, and perhaps I should use Gamma in MeV in the formula. But that would require converting \u0127 to MeV\u00b7s, which would change the calculation.\n\nLet me try that. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s =658.2 MeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV.\n\nSo, tau = \u0127 / Gamma =658.2 MeV\u00b7s / 320 MeV =2.056875e-24 s. Same result.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic gamma factor in a different way. Let me think about the formula again.\n\nL = c * tau * beta = c * ( \u0127 / Gamma ) * beta.\n\nSo, perhaps I can write this as (c * \u0127 * beta) / Gamma.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nc=3e8 m/s,\n\n\u0127=6.582e-25 GeV s,\n\nGamma=0.32 GeV,\n\nbeta=0.9887.\n\nSo,\n\n(3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) * 0.9887 / 0.32 GeV.\n\nCompute numerator: 3e8 *6.582e-25 =1.9746e-16.\n\nMultiply by 0.9887: 1.9746e-16 *0.9887 \u22481.953e-16.\n\nDivide by 0.32: 1.953e-16 /0.32 \u22486.103e-16 m.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the decay width is given as the total width, but perhaps I should use the natural line width formula, which is Gamma = \u0127/tau. So, tau = \u0127/Gamma. Which is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, and I should use Gamma in MeV without converting to GeV. Let me try that.\n\nSo, Gamma =320 MeV.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nBut \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV s. So, to convert to MeV, \u0127 =658.2 MeV s.\n\nSo, tau =658.2 MeV s /320 MeV =2.056875e-24 s. Same as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects me to ignore the velocity factor (beta), which would give L= c * tau =3e8 *2.056875e-24 \u21926.17e-16 m. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, the options include 4.0655e-16 m, which is about 0.66 times my result. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.\n\nWait, let me compute beta again. E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. So, (m c^2)^2 =1.44 GeV^2. E^2=64 GeV^2. So, (m c^2)^2/E^2 =0.0225. 1-0.0225=0.9775. Square root is approximately 0.9887. So, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem uses a different value for \u0127, like 6.58e-25 instead of 6.582e-25. Let me try that.\n\nTau=6.58e-25 /0.32 \u21922.05625e-24 s.\n\nThen, L=3e8 *2.05625e-24 *0.9887 \u21926.103e-16 m.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 5.02e-16 m, but I can't see where I went wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the decay length formula uses the velocity as v = beta c, but perhaps I should use beta gamma instead. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay length is c multiplied by the mean lifetime (tau) multiplied by beta, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mean proper lifetime, tau_0, instead of the dilated tau. So, tau_0 = tau / gamma.\n\nSo, L = c * tau_0 * beta * gamma.\n\nBut gamma is E/(m c^2) =8/1.2\u22486.6667.\n\nSo, tau_0 = tau /gamma = 2.056875e-24 /6.6667\u22483.0853e-25 s.\n\nThen, L =c * tau_0 * beta * gamma \u21923e8 *3.0853e-25 *0.9887 *6.6667.\n\nCompute this:\n\n3e8 *3.0853e-25 =9.2559e-17.\n\nMultiply by 0.9887 \u21929.2559e-17 *0.9887\u22489.135e-17.\n\nMultiply by 6.6667 \u21929.135e-17 *6.6667\u22486.1e-16 m. Same result.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute beta using more precise numbers.\n\nE=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.\n\nE\u00b2=64 GeV\u00b2.\n\nm\u00b2=1.44 GeV\u00b2.\n\nSo, (m c\u00b2)^2 =1.44 GeV\u00b2.\n\nE\u00b2 =64 GeV\u00b2.\n\nSo, (m c^2)^2/E\u00b2=0.0225.\n\n1 -0.0225=0.9775.\n\nThe square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a calculator for sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.988686.\n\nSo, beta=0.988686.\n\nSo, L=3e8 *2.056875e-24 *0.988686.\n\nCompute 3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 0.988686 \u21926.170625e-16 *0.988686 \u22486.103e-16 m.\n\nHmm, same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:5.0223e-16 m. But why is there such a discrepancy? Maybe I should check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says 'mean decay distance'. Oh! Wait a second. The mean decay distance is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm making a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses a different value for the speed of light. For example, c=3e8 m/s, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the decay width is given as 320 MeV, but in the calculation, I should use Gamma in GeV. So, Gamma=0.32 GeV. Correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not seeing why. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the width is given as the full width at half maximum (FWHM), which is 2 Gamma. So, perhaps I should use Gamma=160 MeV. Let me try that.\n\nGamma=160 MeV=0.16 GeV.\n\nTau=6.582e-25 /0.16 \u21924.11375e-24 s.\n\nBeta is same as before, 0.9887.\n\nL=3e8 *4.11375e-24 *0.9887 \u21923e8 *4.11375e-24=1.2341e-15 m. Multiply by 0.9887 \u21921.219e-15 m.\n\nThat's about 1.2e-15 m, which is close to option B (4.06e-15) or option C (5.02e-15). But not matching exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the width is given as the natural linewidth, which is Gamma=320 MeV. So, I think I did the correct calculation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width.\n\nWait, perhaps the decay width is given as the total width, but I should use the natural line width formula, which is Gamma = \u0127/tau. So, tau = \u0127/Gamma. Which I did.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with my calculation, even though it doesn't match the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the beta calculation.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should compute beta using the momentum.\n\nE =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.\n\np = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c \u2192 sqrt(64 -1.44) \u2192 sqrt(62.56) \u21927.91 GeV/c.\n\nSo, beta = p c / E \u2192 (7.91 GeV/c * c ) /8 GeV \u21927.91/8=0.98875.\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A:5.0223e-16 m. But I can't see where I went wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula L = (c * \u0127) * beta / (Gamma * m), but I don't think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay length is given by L = (c * \u0127 * beta) / (Gamma * m c^2). No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option A:5.0223e-16 m, but I'm not sure why.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. So, the question says X is a meson resonance, and we need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various values in meters.\n\nWait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula should be something like distance = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2, where \u03c4 is the mean lifetime, c is the speed of light, and \u03b2 is the velocity in units of c. But how do I find \u03c4 from the given parameters?\n\nOh, right! The width \u0393 is related to the lifetime \u03c4. The uncertainty principle tells us that \u0393 \u2248 \u0127/\u03c4, so \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, I need to make sure about the units here. \u0393 is given in MeV, and I think I should convert that to energy units compatible with \u0127. \n\nWait, \u0127 has units of GeV\u00b7s, right? Because the Planck constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s, and \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0), so same units. But 1 GeV is 1.602 x 10^-10 J. Hmm, maybe I can express \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s terms. I think \u0127 is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, that's the value I remember. \n\nSo, \u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, \u0393 = 0.32 GeV. Therefore, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. Let me plug in the numbers: 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s divided by 0.32 GeV. That should give me \u03c4 in seconds. Let me compute that. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is roughly 2.056875e-24 seconds. So, \u03c4 \u2248 2.057e-24 s.\n\nNext, I need to find the velocity \u03b2. \u03b2 is v/c. How do I find that? I think it's related to the energy and mass of the particle. The energy E is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So, the total energy is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. So, \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2). Wait, but E is already given in GeV and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, because E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2 implies that E in GeV equals \u03b3 m (in GeV/c\u00b2) times c\u00b2. Wait, maybe I should calculate gamma as E / m. Because E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). But since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, let's see. Let me think in terms of units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation between energy, mass, and velocity. The relativistic energy is E\u00b2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. So, p is the momentum, which is gamma m v. So, perhaps I can find the velocity from that.\n\nAlternatively, beta can be found using beta = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)). Let me write that as beta = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E^2)). Wait, but E is the total energy, so yes, that should work. Let's plug in the numbers.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So, m^2 c^4 would be (1.2)^2 (GeV\u00b2/c^4) * c^4 \u2192 (1.44 GeV\u00b2). E squared is (8)^2 =64 GeV\u00b2. So, m\u00b2 c^4 / E\u00b2 = (1.44)/(64) = 0.0225. Then 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So, beta is about 0.9887. So, \u03b2 \u2248 0.9887.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.9775 under square root. Let me think. 0.988 squared is 0.976144. 0.989 squared is 0.978121. Hmm, 0.9775 is between them. Let me compute 0.9887^2: (0.988)^2 is 0.976144. 0.9887 is 0.988 + 0.0007. So, (0.988 + 0.0007)^2 = 0.988\u00b2 + 2*0.988*0.0007 + (0.0007)^2. That's 0.976144 + 0.0013832 + 0.00000049 \u2248 0.9775277. Oh, very close to 0.9775. So, sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So, beta is about 0.9887. So, v \u2248 0.9887 c.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the mean decay distance is c * \u03c4 * beta. So, let's compute that.\n\nc is approximately 3e8 m/s. \u03c4 is 2.057e-24 s. beta is 0.9887.\n\nSo, distance = c * \u03c4 * beta \u2248 (3e8 m/s) * (2.057e-24 s) * 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute this step by step. First, multiply c and tau: 3e8 * 2.057e-24 = 3 * 2.057e-16 = 6.171e-16 m. Then multiply by beta: 6.171e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.105e-16 m.\n\nWait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 range. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating tau. Let me double-check that. Gamma is 0.32 GeV. So, tau is \u0127 / Gamma. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6.582e-25 / 0.32. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So, 20.56875e-25 \u2192 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the decay width is given in MeV, and I converted it correctly to GeV. Yes, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So that part is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta. Let me re-calculate that. Beta squared is 1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E^2). Wait, but in units where c=1, E and m have units GeV and GeV/c\u00b2. Hmm, perhaps I should express everything in terms of c=1, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2. So, (pc)^2 = E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2. Then, p = sqrt( (E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4) ) / c. Then, beta = v/c = p c / E. So, beta = [sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4)] / E.\n\nWait, because p = gamma m v. And beta = v/c. So, p c = gamma m v c = gamma m c\u00b2 beta. Hmm, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, let me express beta as (p c)/E. Because E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 ), so E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + m\u00b2 c^4 ). Then, (pc) = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4). So, beta = (sqrt(E\u00b2 - m^2 c^4 )) / (c E) ) * c. Wait, maybe that's not right. Wait, beta is v/c, so beta = (v) / c. And from p = gamma m v, so v = p c\u00b2/(gamma m c) )? Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute beta as sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)) ? Wait, no, perhaps I should write beta as sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) )? Wait, when E is in energy units, and m is in mass units (GeV/c\u00b2), then E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2. So, (pc)^2 = E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2. Then, p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2) / c.\n\nThen, since p = gamma m v, and gamma = E/(m c\u00b2), then v = (p c)/(gamma m). Substituting p, we get v = [ sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2) / c ] * c / (gamma m ). Simplify: v = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc^2)^2 ) / (gamma m ). But gamma is E/(m c\u00b2), so gamma m = E/(c\u00b2). So, v = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m^2 c^4)) / (E/(c\u00b2) )) \u2192 v = c\u00b2 sqrt( (E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4) ) / E.\n\nWait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Alternatively, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)). Because E = gamma m c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = E/(m c\u00b2). So, gamma = E/(m c\u00b2). Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ) \u2192 sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nYes, that's correct. So, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nWait, but m is in GeV/c\u00b2, and E is in GeV. So, m c\u00b2 is GeV. So, (m c\u00b2)^2 is (GeV)^2, and E is GeV, so E squared is (GeV)^2. So, the ratio is (m c\u00b2)^2 / E^2 = (1.2 GeV)^2 / (8 GeV)^2 = (1.44)/(64) = 0.0225. So, 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root is about 0.9887, as before. So, beta is correct.\n\nSo, back to distance: c * tau * beta. c is 3e8 m/s. tau is 2.057e-24 s. beta is ~0.9887.\n\nSo, distance \u2248 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s * 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute 3e8 * 2.057e-24 = 6.171e-16 meters. Then multiply by 0.9887: 6.171e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.104e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but the options are A) 5.0223e-16 m, B)4.0655e-15 m, etc. Hmm, my calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m, which isn't among the options. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me double-check the beta calculation.\n\nE =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So, (m c^2) = 1.2 GeV. E =8 GeV. So, (m c^2)^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2. E\u00b2 =64 (GeV)^2. So, (m c^2)^2 / E\u00b2 = 1.44/64 = 0.0225. 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root is about 0.9887, which I think is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating tau. Let me check that again. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, tau = \u0127 / Gamma. \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6.582e-25 / 0.32. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So, 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24 s. That seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for decay length isn't just c * tau * beta. Maybe I'm missing a factor. Oh wait! The decay length is c multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau) multiplied by beta. So, L = c * tau * beta. Hmm, that's what I used.\n\nWait, but in some cases, when the particle is moving, the lifetime is dilated. So, the mean lifetime is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. Oh wait, no, the mean lifetime is tau = tau_0 * gamma, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. But in our case, tau is already the mean lifetime, so perhaps I don't need to adjust anything else.\n\nWait, no, because the tau we have is the mean lifetime, which is gamma times the proper lifetime. So, when calculating the decay length, we have L = v * tau. But v is beta c. So, L = beta c tau. Which is what I did.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the energy E is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh! Oh wait, that's a possibility. The question says production energy is 8 GeV. Is that the kinetic energy or the total energy? Because that would change things. If E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be E_total = K + m c^2. But if E is the total energy, then I was correct. \n\nLooking back at the question: it says production energy is 8 GeV. In particle physics, production energy usually refers to the total energy of the particle, not just the kinetic. So I think I was correct to use E as the total energy.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me try an alternative approach. Let me compute gamma first. Gamma = E/(m c^2) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8/1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nThen, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), so 1 - beta^2 = 1/(gamma^2) = 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) = (1.2^2)/(8^2) )= 1.44/64 = 0.0225. So, beta^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775, beta = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. Same result as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of \u0127. Let me check the value of \u0127. I thought it's approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Let me verify that. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. Then \u0127 = h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. To convert to GeV\u00b7s, since 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J, then 1 J = 1/(1.602e-10) GeV. So, 1 J\u00b7s = (1 GeV)/(1.602e-10) ) s. Therefore, \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s is 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 GeV)/(1.602e-10 J) ) \u2192 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-10 \u2248 6.586e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, my value was correct.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is that I should use the width in the denominator as Gamma = 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, tau = \u0127 / Gamma \u2192 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the decay length more accurately. Let me compute each part step by step.\n\nCompute c * tau: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s \u2192 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen, multiply by beta (0.9887): 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2192 let me compute that. 6.170625 * 0.9887 \u2248 approximately 6.104e-16 m.\n\nHmm, but the options are A)5.02e-16, C)5.02e-15, etc. So none match. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of beta? Or perhaps I forgot to account for something else?\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the decay width is given as \u0393 = 320 MeV, which is the total width, and the mean lifetime is tau = \u0127 / (Gamma). But wait, in some conventions, the width is Gamma = \u0127 / tau, so tau = \u0127 / Gamma. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me compute beta^2 again. m is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV. So, (m c^2)^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44. E^2 is 64. So, 1.44/64 = 0.0225. 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root is approximately 0.9887. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the relativistic relation involving the velocity. Let me think again about the decay length formula. Decay length L = c * tau * beta. So, L = c * (\u0127 / Gamma) * beta. Let me express everything in terms of \u0127 c.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can write it as L = (c * \u0127 / Gamma) * beta. Let me plug in the numbers: c is 3e8 m/s, \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, Gamma is 0.32 GeV. So, 3e8 * 6.582e-25 / 0.32 \u2192 3e8 * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) \u2192 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 \u2192 6.1706e-16 m. Then multiply by beta (0.9887) \u2192 ~6.104e-16 m. Still not matching any options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately. 0.9887^2 is 0.97752, which is very close to 0.9775. So, beta is 0.9887.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the units. Let me recheck the units for \u0127. \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s is approximately 6.582e-25. So, when I compute tau = \u0127 / Gamma, the units are (GeV\u00b7s) / GeV = s. Correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the error is elsewhere. Let me think about the problem again. The decay length is L = c * tau * beta. So, perhaps I should express everything in natural units to see if that helps.\n\nIn natural units, c=1, \u0127=1. So, tau = \u0127 / Gamma \u2192 1 / Gamma. But Gamma is given in GeV, so 0.32 GeV. So, tau in natural units is 1 / 0.32 \u2248 3.125. But to convert to seconds, since \u0127 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, so tau in seconds is (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the decay length in natural units and then convert. So, L in natural units is (tau) * beta. So, 3.125 * 0.9887 \u2248 3.090. Then, convert to meters. Natural unit conversion: 1 (natural unit length) = 197.3 MeV^-1 \u2248 1.973e-16 m (since 1 MeV^-1 is 1.973e-16 m). Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 GeV^-1 is 1.973e-16 m * (1 GeV/1 MeV) ) \u2192 197.3 MeV^-1 = 1.973e-16 m \u2192 so 1 GeV^-1 is (1.973e-16 m) * (1 MeV/1 GeV) ) \u2192 1.973e-16 * 1e-3 = 1.973e-19 m. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, 1 meter is about 5.07e+15 GeV^-1. Because 1 m = 1.973e-16 m\u00b7GeV \u2192 So, 1 GeV^-1 = (1.973e-16 m) * (1 GeV) ) \u2192 Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the conversion factor.\n\nThe conversion factor from natural units (GeV^-1) to meters is 197.327 MeV^-1 = 1.97327e-16 m. So, 1 GeV^-1 = 0.197327e-15 m.\n\nWait, 1 MeV^-1 is 1.973e-16 m. So, 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV, so 1 GeV^-1 = (1e-3) MeV^-1. So, 1 GeV^-1 = 1.973e-19 m.\n\nSo, L in natural units is 3.090 GeV^-1. To convert to meters: 3.090 * 1.973e-19 m. Let me compute that.\n\n3.090 * 1.973e-19 \u2248 6.10e-19 m? No, wait, 3.09 * 1.973 is about 6.104, so 6.104e-19 m. Wait, that's way smaller than the options, which are ~e-15 or e-16. Hmm, that can't be right. So, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion.\n\nWait, no, in natural units, L = c * tau * beta. But perhaps I should have L = tau * beta in natural units, since c=1. So, tau in natural units is 1 / (Gamma in GeV) \u2192 1 / 0.32 \u22483.125 GeV^-1. Multiply by beta (0.9887) \u2192 3.125 *0.9887 \u22483.09 GeV^-1. Then, 1 GeV^-1 is 1.973e-16 m * (1 GeV/1 MeV) ) \u2192 wait, no, 1 GeV^-1 is 1.973e-16 m / 1000 \u2192 1.973e-19 m.\n\nWait, so 3.09 GeV^-1 = 3.09 * 1.973e-19 m \u22486.10e-19 m. That's way smaller than the options. So, I must have done something wrong.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I messed up the natural unit conversion. Let me think again. 1 GeV^-1 equals 197.3 MeV^-1. Since 1 MeV^-1 is 1.973e-16 m, then 1 GeV^-1 = 197.3e-3 * 1.973e-16 m. Wait, no: 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV \u2192 1 GeV^-1 = 1e-3 MeV^-1. So, 1 GeV^-1 = 1e-3 * 1.973e-16 m = 1.973e-19 m. So, 3.09 GeV^-1 is 3.09 * 1.973e-19 \u2248 6.10e-19 m. Which is way smaller than the options. So, I must have a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the answer isn't among the options, which suggests that I made a mistake in the initial approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Let me think of another way.\n\nWait, another approach: The mean path length is given by L = c * tau * beta. So, if I can compute tau and beta correctly, I can find L.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma. Gamma is 0.32 GeV. So, tau = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nBeta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) \u2192 sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) \u2192 sqrt(1 - 0.0225) \u2192 sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo, L = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.9887 \u2192 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.1706e-16 m. Multiply by 0.9887 \u2192 6.104e-16 m.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have this. The closest is option A:5.0223e-16, which is about 0.82 times my result. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate beta more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) precisely.\n\n0.9887^2 = 0.97752. That's very close to 0.9775. So, beta is approximately 0.9887.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise values for \u0127. Let's take \u0127 as 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 \u2192 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approximation for beta. Let me compute beta using more precise numbers.\n\nE =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.\n\nE\u00b2 =64, m\u00b2=1.44.\n\nSo, m\u00b2/(E\u00b2) = 0.0225.\n\nSo, 1 - m\u00b2/E\u00b2 = 0.9775.\n\nWhat's the square root of 0.9775? Let me compute it accurately.\n\nLet me compute 0.9887^2 \u2192 0.97752. So, 0.9887^2 =0.97752. So, 0.9775 is slightly less than that, so beta is a bit less than 0.9887. Let me compute 0.9887^2 =0.97752. We have 0.9775, which is 0.9775 = 0.97752 - 0.00002. So, it's 0.9887 - delta, where delta is small.\n\nLet me compute delta. Let x=0.9887 - delta. Then x^2 = (0.9887 - delta)^2 \u2248 0.97752 - 2*0.9887*delta = 0.9775. So,\n\n0.97752 - 2 * 0.9887 * delta = 0.9775.\n\nSo, 2 * 0.9887 * delta = 0.00002.\n\ndelta = 0.00002/(2 * 0.9887) \u2248 0.000010115.\n\nSo, beta \u2248 0.9887 - 0.000010115 \u2248 0.988689885.\n\nSo, approximately 0.98869.\n\nSo, beta is about 0.98869.\n\nSo, when I compute L = c * tau * beta, let's see:\n\nc =3e8 m/s, tau=2.056875e-24 s, beta=0.98869.\n\nSo, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 0.98869: 6.170625e-16 * 0.98869 \u2248 6.103e-16 m.\n\nStill not matching any options. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, which is an order of magnitude higher than my result. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the decay width is given in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a different formula. Let me think: The decay length can also be calculated using the formula L = (c * \u0127) / (Gamma) * beta. Because L = c * tau * beta, and tau = \u0127/(Gamma), so L = c * \u0127 * beta / Gamma.\n\nSo, let's compute that. c is 3e8 m/s, \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV s, Gamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, (c * \u0127) / Gamma = (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) \u2192 3e8 * 6.582e-25 /0.32.\n\nCompute that: 3e8 * 6.582e-25 = 1.9746e-16. Divide by 0.32: 1.9746e-16 / 0.32 =6.1706e-16 m. Then multiply by beta (0.98869): 6.1706e-16 * 0.98869 \u22486.104e-16 m. Same result as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that I'm using E as the total energy, but maybe it's the kinetic energy. Let me recalculate beta assuming E is the kinetic energy.\n\nIf E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy E_total = K + m c^2 =8 GeV +1.2 GeV=9.2 GeV.\n\nThen, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E_total^2)).\n\nSo, (m c^2)^2 = (1.2)^2 =1.44. E_total^2 = (9.2)^2=84.64.\n\nSo, (m c^2)^2 / E_total^2 =1.44/84.64\u22480.017004. 1-0.017004=0.982996. Square root is approximately 0.99145.\n\nSo, beta is about 0.99145.\n\nThen, L =c * tau * beta \u2192 3e8 *2.056875e-24 *0.99145 \u2192 3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.1706e-16 m. Multiply by 0.99145 \u21926.11e-16 m. Still not matching.\n\nHmm, but the options are either around 4e-15 or 5e-16. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the width is given as the full width at half maximum (FWHM), but I think the formula uses the same Gamma. I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the relation L = (c * \u0127) * beta / (Gamma). Which is what I did.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is using the natural unit conversion differently. Let me think again about the unit conversion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula L = (c * \u0127) * beta / (Gamma * c), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is L = (c * \u0127 * beta) / (Gamma * m), but I don't think that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the mean decay distance is given by L = (c * tau) * beta. So, that's what I've done.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So, perhaps I should use 0.32 GeV as Gamma. Which I did.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption A:5.0223e-16 m.\n\nOption C:5.0223e-15 m.\n\nWait, my calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m. None of the options match. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for velocity. Let me compute gamma again.\n\nGamma = E/(m c^2) \u2192 E is 8 GeV, m c^2 is 1.2 GeV. So, gamma =8/1.2\u22486.6667.\n\nThen, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) \u2192 sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444))) ) \u2192 sqrt(1 -0.0225) \u2192 sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887. So, same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question has a typo and the options are wrong. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using a different approach.\n\nWait, another formula: The mean decay length can be expressed as L = (c * \u0127 * beta) / (Gamma). So, L = (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) * beta / (0.32 GeV).\n\nSo, 3e8 *6.582e-25 = 1.9746e-16. Divide by 0.32: 6.1706e-16. Multiply by beta (0.9887): 6.104e-16 m.\n\nHmm, same result. So, perhaps I should check the options again. Are there any options close to 6e-16? No. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the production energy is the energy in the lab frame, and perhaps I should calculate the velocity differently. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is given in GeV/c\u00b2, so when I compute E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, the units should be consistent.\n\nWait, let's try expressing everything in terms of GeV and c=1.\n\nE =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So, E\u00b2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 \u2192 (p c)^2 = E\u00b2 - m^2 c^4 \u2192 (p c)^2 =64 -1.44 \u219262.56. So, p c = sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.\n\nSo, p =7.91 GeV / c.\n\nThen, beta = v/c = (p c)/(E) \u2192 (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) )=0.98875. So, beta is 0.98875.\n\nWait, so using this approach, beta is approximately 0.98875. So, that's the same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me compute the velocity v = beta c =0.98875 c.\n\nThen, the time dilation factor gamma is E/(m c^2) =8/(1.2)=6.6667.\n\nThen, the lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. So, tau_0 = \u0127 / (Gamma) \u2192 6.582e-25 GeV s /0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. The mean lifetime is tau = \u0127 / Gamma, which is already in the lab frame. So, tau =2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo, the decay length is L = v * tau = beta c tau =0.98875 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCompute that: 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 =6.1706e-16 m. Multiply by 0.98875 \u21926.104e-16 m. Same as before.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are A:5.02e-16, B:4.0655e-15, C:5.02e-15, D:4.0655e-16.\n\nWait, option D is 4.0655e-16 m. Which is about 0.666 times my result. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.\n\nWait, let me compute beta more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) using a calculator approach.\n\nI can use the binomial expansion for sqrt(1 - x), where x is small. So, sqrt(1 -x) \u22481 -x/2 -x^2/8 - ... For x=0.0225, which is not very small, but perhaps this can give a better approximation.\n\nSo, sqrt(0.9775) = sqrt(1 -0.0225)=1 -0.0225/2 - (0.0225)^2/(8) - ... \u21921 -0.01125 - (0.00050625)/8 \u21921 -0.01125 -0.00006328125\u22480.98868671875.\n\nSo, beta \u22480.98868671875.\n\nNow, compute L =3e8 *2.056875e-24 *0.98868671875.\n\nCompute 3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 0.98868671875: 6.170625e-16 *0.98868671875.\n\nLet me compute this: 6.170625 * 0.98868671875 \u22486.103e-16 m.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think about the formula again. Decay length L = c * tau * beta.\n\nAnother approach: Let me compute using the natural unit conversion factor.\n\nIn natural units, c=1, \u0127=1, and the conversion from GeV^-1 to meters is 197.327 MeV^-1 = 1.97327e-16 m. So, 1 GeV^-1 = 0.197327e-15 m.\n\nSo, L in natural units is (tau) * beta. Tau is \u0127 / Gamma \u2192 1 / 0.32 GeV \u22483.125 GeV^-1.\n\nSo, L =3.125 *0.9887 \u22483.09 GeV^-1.\n\nConvert to meters: 3.09 GeV^-1 * 0.197327e-15 m/GeV^-1 \u21923.09 *0.197327e-15 \u2192 6.103e-16 m. Again, same result.\n\nHmm, I'm not seeing any error in my calculations. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that can't be, so I must have missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the width in MeV without converting to GeV. Let me try that.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV =0.32 GeV, so that's correct. Wait, no, perhaps I should keep Gamma in MeV and adjust the units accordingly. Let me try that.\n\nSo, tau = \u0127 / Gamma. But \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Gamma is 320 MeV =0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, tau =6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV =2.056875e-24 s. Same as before.\n\nHmm, same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for \u0127. Let me try using \u0127=6.58e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Let's see.\n\nTau =6.58e-25 /0.32 =2.05625e-24 s.\n\nThen, L=3e8 *2.05625e-24 *0.9887 \u2192 3e8 *2.05625e-24 =6.16875e-16 m. Multiply by 0.9887 \u21926.103e-16 m.\n\nStill same result.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me think about the possible answers. The options are:\n\nA)5.0223e-16 m\n\nB)4.0655e-15 m\n\nC)5.0223e-15 m\n\nD)4.0655e-16 m\n\nIf I take my result of 6.103e-16 m and compare to the options, perhaps the closest is option A (5.02e-16), which is about 80% of my result. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta, but I can't see where.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the decay width as Gamma = 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, but perhaps the formula uses Gamma in units of GeV. So, tau = \u0127 / Gamma \u2192 6.582e-25 / 0.32 =2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of beta. Let me compute beta using more precise numbers.\n\nCompute beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nm=1.2 GeV/c\u00b2, E=8 GeV.\n\nSo, (m c^2)^2 = (1.2)^2 =1.44.\n\nE^2 =8^2=64.\n\nSo, (m c^2)^2 /E^2 =1.44/64=0.0225.\n\nSo, 1-0.0225=0.9775.\n\nThe square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) using a calculator.\n\n0.9887^2=0.97752.\n\nSo, 0.9775 is 0.97752 -0.00002. So, let me use the linear approximation.\n\nsqrt(0.9775) = sqrt(0.97752 -0.00002) \u2248 sqrt(0.97752) - (0.00002)/(2 * sqrt(0.97752)).\n\nWhich is approximately 0.9887 - (0.00002)/(2 * 0.9887) \u2192 0.9887 - (1e-5)/0.9887 \u2248 0.9887 - 1.0115e-5 \u22480.988698885.\n\nSo, beta is approximately 0.988698885.\n\nNow, compute L =3e8 *2.056875e-24 *0.988698885.\n\n3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 0.988698885 \u21926.170625e-16 *0.988698885 \u22486.103e-16 m.\n\nStill the same.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider that the width is given in MeV, and perhaps I should use Gamma in MeV in the formula. But that would require converting \u0127 to MeV\u00b7s, which would change the calculation.\n\nLet me try that. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s =658.2 MeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV.\n\nSo, tau = \u0127 / Gamma =658.2 MeV\u00b7s / 320 MeV =2.056875e-24 s. Same result.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic gamma factor in a different way. Let me think about the formula again.\n\nL = c * tau * beta = c * ( \u0127 / Gamma ) * beta.\n\nSo, perhaps I can write this as (c * \u0127 * beta) / Gamma.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nc=3e8 m/s,\n\n\u0127=6.582e-25 GeV s,\n\nGamma=0.32 GeV,\n\nbeta=0.9887.\n\nSo,\n\n(3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) * 0.9887 / 0.32 GeV.\n\nCompute numerator: 3e8 *6.582e-25 =1.9746e-16.\n\nMultiply by 0.9887: 1.9746e-16 *0.9887 \u22481.953e-16.\n\nDivide by 0.32: 1.953e-16 /0.32 \u22486.103e-16 m.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the decay width is given as the total width, but perhaps I should use the natural line width formula, which is Gamma = \u0127/tau. So, tau = \u0127/Gamma. Which is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, and I should use Gamma in MeV without converting to GeV. Let me try that.\n\nSo, Gamma =320 MeV.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nBut \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV s. So, to convert to MeV, \u0127 =658.2 MeV s.\n\nSo, tau =658.2 MeV s /320 MeV =2.056875e-24 s. Same as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects me to ignore the velocity factor (beta), which would give L= c * tau =3e8 *2.056875e-24 \u21926.17e-16 m. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, the options include 4.0655e-16 m, which is about 0.66 times my result. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.\n\nWait, let me compute beta again. E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. So, (m c^2)^2 =1.44 GeV^2. E^2=64 GeV^2. So, (m c^2)^2/E^2 =0.0225. 1-0.0225=0.9775. Square root is approximately 0.9887. So, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem uses a different value for \u0127, like 6.58e-25 instead of 6.582e-25. Let me try that.\n\nTau=6.58e-25 /0.32 \u21922.05625e-24 s.\n\nThen, L=3e8 *2.05625e-24 *0.9887 \u21926.103e-16 m.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 5.02e-16 m, but I can't see where I went wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the decay length formula uses the velocity as v = beta c, but perhaps I should use beta gamma instead. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay length is c multiplied by the mean lifetime (tau) multiplied by beta, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mean proper lifetime, tau_0, instead of the dilated tau. So, tau_0 = tau / gamma.\n\nSo, L = c * tau_0 * beta * gamma.\n\nBut gamma is E/(m c^2) =8/1.2\u22486.6667.\n\nSo, tau_0 = tau /gamma = 2.056875e-24 /6.6667\u22483.0853e-25 s.\n\nThen, L =c * tau_0 * beta * gamma \u21923e8 *3.0853e-25 *0.9887 *6.6667.\n\nCompute this:\n\n3e8 *3.0853e-25 =9.2559e-17.\n\nMultiply by 0.9887 \u21929.2559e-17 *0.9887\u22489.135e-17.\n\nMultiply by 6.6667 \u21929.135e-17 *6.6667\u22486.1e-16 m. Same result.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute beta using more precise numbers.\n\nE=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.\n\nE\u00b2=64 GeV\u00b2.\n\nm\u00b2=1.44 GeV\u00b2.\n\nSo, (m c\u00b2)^2 =1.44 GeV\u00b2.\n\nE\u00b2 =64 GeV\u00b2.\n\nSo, (m c^2)^2/E\u00b2=0.0225.\n\n1 -0.0225=0.9775.\n\nThe square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a calculator for sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.988686.\n\nSo, beta=0.988686.\n\nSo, L=3e8 *2.056875e-24 *0.988686.\n\nCompute 3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 0.988686 \u21926.170625e-16 *0.988686 \u22486.103e-16 m.\n\nHmm, same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:5.0223e-16 m. But why is there such a discrepancy? Maybe I should check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says 'mean decay distance'. Oh! Wait a second. The mean decay distance is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm making a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses a different value for the speed of light. For example, c=3e8 m/s, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the decay width is given as 320 MeV, but in the calculation, I should use Gamma in GeV. So, Gamma=0.32 GeV. Correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not seeing why. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the width is given as the full width at half maximum (FWHM), which is 2 Gamma. So, perhaps I should use Gamma=160 MeV. Let me try that.\n\nGamma=160 MeV=0.16 GeV.\n\nTau=6.582e-25 /0.16 \u21924.11375e-24 s.\n\nBeta is same as before, 0.9887.\n\nL=3e8 *4.11375e-24 *0.9887 \u21923e8 *4.11375e-24=1.2341e-15 m. Multiply by 0.9887 \u21921.219e-15 m.\n\nThat's about 1.2e-15 m, which is close to option B (4.06e-15) or option C (5.02e-15). But not matching exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the width is given as the natural linewidth, which is Gamma=320 MeV. So, I think I did the correct calculation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width.\n\nWait, perhaps the decay width is given as the total width, but I should use the natural line width formula, which is Gamma = \u0127/tau. So, tau = \u0127/Gamma. Which I did.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with my calculation, even though it doesn't match the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the beta calculation.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should compute beta using the momentum.\n\nE =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.\n\np = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c \u2192 sqrt(64 -1.44) \u2192 sqrt(62.56) \u21927.91 GeV/c.\n\nSo, beta = p c / E \u2192 (7.91 GeV/c * c ) /8 GeV \u21927.91/8=0.98875.\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A:5.0223e-16 m. But I can't see where I went wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula L = (c * \u0127) * beta / (Gamma * m), but I don't think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay length is given by L = (c * \u0127 * beta) / (Gamma * m c^2). No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option A:5.0223e-16 m, but I'm not sure why.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the formula for the decay length:\n\n\\[\nL = c \\cdot \\tau \\cdot \\beta\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light (\\( 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)),\n- \\( \\tau \\) is the mean lifetime of the particle,\n- \\( \\beta = v/c \\) is the velocity of the particle in units of \\( c \\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the mean lifetime (\\( \\tau \\))\nThe mean lifetime \\( \\tau \\) is related to the decay width \\( \\Gamma \\) by:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( \\Gamma = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\),\n- \\( \\hbar = 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s} \\),\n\nwe calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the velocity factor (\\( \\beta \\))\nThe velocity factor \\( \\beta \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{m^2 c^4}{E^2}}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( m = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2 \\),\n- \\( E = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\),\n\nwe compute:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m^2 c^4}{E^2} = \\frac{(1.2)^2}{(8)^2} = \\frac{1.44}{64} = 0.0225,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \\sqrt{0.9775} \\approx 0.9887.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the decay length (\\( L \\))\nSubstituting into the formula for \\( L \\):\n\n\\[\nL = c \\cdot \\tau \\cdot \\beta\n\\]\n\n\\[\nL = (3 \\times 10^8) \\cdot (2.056875 \\times 10^{-24}) \\cdot 0.9887\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( c \\cdot \\tau \\):\n\n\\[\nc \\cdot \\tau = 3 \\times 10^8 \\cdot 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} = 6.170625 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by \\( \\beta \\):\n\n\\[\nL = 6.170625 \\times 10^{-16} \\cdot 0.9887 \\approx 6.103 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the options\nThe calculated decay length is approximately \\( 6.103 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.\n\nThe question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and their mean decay distance depends on their lifetime and speed. Oh right, the mean decay length is the product of the lifetime and the velocity multiplied by the speed of light, I think. So the formula should be something like L = gamma * v * c * tau, where tau is the lifetime.\n\nWait, but how do I find the lifetime tau? Oh, right, the width \u0393 is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (which is \u0393/2 for a resonance) and the time uncertainty (tau) is on the order of \u0127. So the equation is \u0393 * tau \u2248 \u0127. So tau is approximately \u0127/(\u0393). But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship. Let me think: the width \u0393 is the total decay width, and the lifetime tau is inversely proportional to \u0393. So tau = \u0127/(\u0393). Right.\n\nSo first, I need to calculate the lifetime tau. Then, find the velocity of the meson. Wait, the production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. Hmm, I think I need to find the velocity using the relativistic energy equations. Oh, right, the total energy E is gamma times m c squared. So E = gamma m c^2.\n\nSo gamma is E/(m c^2). Let me compute that. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.\n\nBut wait, gamma is also related to velocity. The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). So from gamma, I can solve for v.\n\nLet me compute gamma first. 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666... So gamma = 6.6667. Then, 1/gamma squared is (1/6.6667)^2. Let's see, 1/6.6667 is 0.15, so squared is 0.0225. So 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/(gamma^2) = 0.0225. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking square root, v/c is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887c.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute 6.6667 squared. 6.6667^2 is about (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u224844.444. So 1/gamma squared is 1/44.444 \u2248 0.0225. So 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.0225 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.9775 \u2192 v = sqrt(0.9775) * c.\n\nCalculating sqrt(0.9775): let's see, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887c.\n\nNow, the lifetime tau is \u0127 divided by \u0393. But wait, the units need to match. The width \u0393 is given as 320 MeV. So I need to convert that into energy in the same units as \u0127. Oh wait, \u0127 has units of GeV\u00b7s or something? Let me think. The natural unit system often uses \u0127 = c = 1, but when calculating with SI units, I need to be careful.\n\nWait, \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, but converting eV to J: 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. So \u0127 is (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s) * (1.6e-19 J/eV)^-1 * (1 GeV = 1e9 eV) \u2192 but this might get messy. Alternatively, I remember that \u0127 c is about 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm, but maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe I should use natural units where \u0127 = c = 1. But in that case, the lifetime would be in inverse energy. So to get the lifetime in seconds, I need to multiply by \u0127. So let me see. Let's convert \u0393 into GeV.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = \u0127 / \u0393. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s. Let me compute that.\n\n6.582e-25 / 0.32 \u2248 (6.582 / 0.32) ) * 1e-25 = approximately 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 \u00d7 20 = 6.4. 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182. So 0.32 \u00d7 20.56875 = 6.582. So yes, 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo tau \u2248 2.057e-24 seconds.\n\nNow, the velocity v is approximately 0.9887c. So the mean decay length is L = gamma * v * c * tau. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The mean decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nBeta is v/c, so beta is 0.9887. So beta * gamma is (0.9887) * (6.6667). Let me compute that: 0.9887 * 6.6667 \u2248 approximately 6.6 (since 6.6667 * 0.9887 is roughly 6.6). Let me calculate it more accurately.\n\n6.6667 * 0.9887:\n\n6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.\n\n0.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.6591.\n\nSo total is approximately 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.\n\nSo beta * gamma \u2248 6.5913.\n\nThen, L = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nc is approximately 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nMultiply 6.5913 by 3e8: 6.5913 * 3e8 = 1.97739e9.\n\nThen multiply by 2.057e-24 s:\n\n1.97739e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.057) ) * 1e-15.\n\nCompute 1.97739 * 2.057: let's see.\n\n2 * 1.97739 \u2248 3.95478.\n\n0.057 * 1.97739 \u2248 approx 0.057 * 2 = 0.114, but let me do it more accurately:\n\n0.057 * 1.97739 = 0.112268.\n\nSo total is approx 3.95478 + 0.112268 = 4.06705.\n\nSo L \u2248 4.067e-15 meters.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact calculation. 1.97739 * 2.057.\n\nLet me compute 1.97739 * 2 = 3.95478.\n\n1.97739 * 0.057 = let's compute 1.97739 * 0.05 = 0.0988695 and 1.97739 * 0.007 = 0.01384173. Sum: 0.11271123.\n\nSo 3.95478 + 0.11271123 = 4.06749123.\n\nSo L = 4.0675e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15, which is about 5e-15, and option B is 4.0655e-15. Hmm, our calculation is about 4.0675e-15 m, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m. But wait, perhaps I made a slight approximation in the beta*gamma term.\n\nWait, let me double-check the beta*gamma calculation. Beta was approximately 0.9887, and gamma is 6.6667.\n\nBeta * gamma = 0.9887 * (8/1.2) = 0.9887 * (6.6666667) \u2248 let me compute this accurately.\n\n6.6666667 * 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.\n\n0.6666667 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.6666667 * 0.9887 = (2/3) * 0.9887 \u2248 0.6591.\n\nSo 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.\n\nSo beta*gamma \u2248 6.5913.\n\nThen, L = beta gamma * c tau.\n\nWait, c tau is the speed of light multiplied by the lifetime. Let me compute c * tau: 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = 6.171e-16 meters.\n\nThen, beta gamma * c tau = 6.5913 * 6.171e-16 m.\n\nCompute 6.5913 * 6.171e-16:\n\n6 * 6.171e-16 = 3.7026e-15.\n\n0.5913 * 6.171e-16 \u2248 3.652e-16.\n\nSo total is approximately 3.7026e-15 + 3.652e-16 = 3.7026 + 0.3652 = 4.0678e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's what I had before. So that's 4.0678e-15 meters, which is approximately 4.068e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption B is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nOption C is 5.0223e-15 m.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation of beta*gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps using more precise values for beta and gamma would get a more accurate result.\n\nLet me recalculate gamma. Gamma is E/(m c^2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) )= 8/1.2 = 6.666666666666667.\n\nBeta is v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nSo 1/gamma^2 is 1/(44.4444444) = 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(0.9775) = let me compute this accurately.\n\nsqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, but let's compute it more precisely.\n\n0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2.\n\n0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2*0.98*0.0087 = 2 * 0.008526 = 0.017052.\n\n0.0087^2 = 0.00007569.\n\nAdding up: 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452 + 0.00007569 = 0.97752769.\n\nBut 0.9775 is what we have. So 0.9887^2 is 0.97752769, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So perhaps beta is a bit less than 0.9887. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.\n\nAnother approach: Let me use the Taylor expansion or some approximation for sqrt near x=0.9775.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that 0.988^2 = (0.988)^2.\n\n0.988 * 0.988 = (1 - 0.012)^2 = 1 - 0.024 + 0.000144 = 0.976144.\n\nWait, that's less than 0.9775. So 0.988^2 is 0.976144, which is less than 0.9775.\n\nSo 0.988^2 = 0.976144.\n\nWhat about 0.989^2?\n\n(0.989)^2 = (0.98 + 0.009)^2 = 0.9604 + 2*0.98*0.009 + 0.009^2.\n\n= 0.9604 + 0.01764 + 0.000081 = 0.9604 + 0.01764 = 0.97804 + 0.000081 = 0.978121.\n\nWhich is higher than 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is between 0.988 and 0.989.\n\nLet me compute 0.9885^2.\n\n0.9885 * 0.9885.\n\n= (0.988 + 0.0005)^2.\n\n= 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.\n\n= 0.976144 + 0.000988 + 0.00000025 = 0.97713225.\n\nStill less than 0.9775.\n\n0.9886^2:\n\n= (0.9885 + 0.0001)^2 = 0.97713225 + 2*0.9885*0.0001 + 0.00000001.\n\n= 0.97713225 + 0.0001977 + 0.00000001 \u2248 0.97732996.\n\nStill less than 0.9775.\n\n0.9887^2: as we saw earlier, about 0.97752769.\n\nWhich is a bit higher than 0.9775.\n\nSo sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.98865.\n\nSo beta is approximately 0.98865.\n\nSo beta * gamma is 0.98865 * 6.666666667.\n\nLet me compute that more accurately.\n\n0.98865 * 6.666666667.\n\n= 0.98865 * (20/3) = (0.98865 * 20) / 3.\n\n0.98865 * 20 = 19.773.\n\n19.773 / 3 = 6.591.\n\nSo beta*gamma is approximately 6.591.\n\nSo L = beta gamma * c tau.\n\nc tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = 6.171e-16 m.\n\nSo L = 6.591 * 6.171e-16 m.\n\nCompute 6.591 * 6.171e-16.\n\n6 * 6.171e-16 = 3.7026e-15.\n\n0.591 * 6.171e-16 = let's compute 0.5 * 6.171e-16 = 3.0855e-16, and 0.091 * 6.171e-16 \u2248 5.619e-17.\n\nAdding those: 3.0855e-16 + 5.619e-17 = 3.6474e-16.\n\nSo total L = 3.7026e-15 + 3.6474e-16 = 3.7026e-15 + 0.36474e-15 = (3.7026 + 0.36474) e-15 = 4.06734e-15 m.\n\nSo approximately 4.0673e-15 m. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating tau. Let me double-check that.\n\nTau is \u0127 / \u0393. So \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. \u0393 is 0.32 GeV. So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?\n\n6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875.\n\nSo tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what about the calculation of c * tau?\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nc * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen, beta gamma is 6.591, so L = 6.591 * 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nCompute 6.591 * 6.170625e-16.\n\n6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.591 * 6.170625e-16 = let's calculate:\n\n0.5 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.0853125e-16.\n\n0.091 * 6.170625e-16 = 0.091 * 6.170625 = approx 0.561666...e-16.\n\nSo 3.0853125e-16 + 0.561666e-16 = 3.646978e-16.\n\nSo total L = 3.702375e-15 + 3.646978e-16 = 4.067073e-15 m.\n\nWhich is about 4.067e-15 m. So the option closest is B: 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, a slight discrepancy. Maybe I made a miscalculation in beta*gamma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using more precise values for \u0127.\n\nWait, \u0127 is 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo tau = \u0127 / \u0393 = 6.582e-25 / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 s.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.\n\nSo tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute beta*gamma more accurately.\n\nBeta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).\n\ngamma = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 \u22486.666666666666667.\n\ngamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u224844.4444444444.\n\nSo 1/(gamma^2) is 9/400 = 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 0.9775.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(0.9775) = approx 0.988675.\n\nSo beta * gamma = 0.988675 * 6.666666666666667.\n\nCompute that: 0.988675 * 6.666666666666667.\n\n= 0.988675 * (20/3) = (0.988675 *20)/3 = 19.7735 /3 = 6.591166666666666666666666666...\n\nSo beta*gamma \u22486.5911666666666666667.\n\nThen, L = 6.591166666666667 * c * tau.\n\nc * tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nSo L = 6.591166666666667 * 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nCompute 6 *6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.591166666666667 *6.170625e-16 = let's compute:\n\n0.5 *6.170625e-16=3.0853125e-16.\n\n0.091166666666667 *6.170625e-16.\n\nCompute 0.09 *6.170625e-16 = 0.55535625e-16.\n\n0.001166666666667 *6.170625e-16 \u22487.189e-19.\n\nSo 0.091166666666667 *6.170625e-16 \u22480.55535625e-16 + 7.189e-19 = approx 0.55607515e-16.\n\nSo total 0.5 part is 3.0853125e-16, plus 0.55607515e-16 = 3.64138765e-16.\n\nSo L =3.702375e-15 +3.64138765e-16 = (3.702375 +0.364138765)e-15 = 4.066513765e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.0665e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close, so perhaps I should choose that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation expects us to approximate beta*gamma as 6.59, leading to 6.59 *6.170625e-16 = ?\n\n6 *6.170625e-16 =3.702375e-15.\n\n0.59 *6.170625e-16 = 3.63062e-16.\n\nSo 3.702375e-15 +3.63062e-16 = 4.065437e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.0654e-15 m, which matches option B exactly (4.0655e-15 m).\n\nAh, so that's why option B is the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.\n\nThe question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and their mean decay distance depends on their lifetime and speed. Oh right, the mean decay length is the product of the lifetime and the velocity multiplied by the speed of light, I think. So the formula should be something like L = gamma * v * c * tau, where tau is the lifetime.\n\nWait, but how do I find the lifetime tau? Oh, right, the width \u0393 is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (which is \u0393/2 for a resonance) and the time uncertainty (tau) is on the order of \u0127. So the equation is \u0393 * tau \u2248 \u0127. So tau is approximately \u0127/(\u0393). But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship. Let me think: the width \u0393 is the total decay width, and the lifetime tau is inversely proportional to \u0393. So tau = \u0127/(\u0393). Right.\n\nSo first, I need to calculate the lifetime tau. Then, find the velocity of the meson. Wait, the production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. Hmm, I think I need to find the velocity using the relativistic energy equations. Oh, right, the total energy E is gamma times m c squared. So E = gamma m c^2.\n\nSo gamma is E/(m c^2). Let me compute that. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.\n\nBut wait, gamma is also related to velocity. The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). So from gamma, I can solve for v.\n\nLet me compute gamma first. 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666... So gamma = 6.6667. Then, 1/gamma squared is (1/6.6667)^2. Let's see, 1/6.6667 is 0.15, so squared is 0.0225. So 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/(gamma^2) = 0.0225. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking square root, v/c is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887c.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute 6.6667 squared. 6.6667^2 is about (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u224844.444. So 1/gamma squared is 1/44.444 \u2248 0.0225. So 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.0225 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.9775 \u2192 v = sqrt(0.9775) * c.\n\nCalculating sqrt(0.9775): let's see, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887c.\n\nNow, the lifetime tau is \u0127 divided by \u0393. But wait, the units need to match. The width \u0393 is given as 320 MeV. So I need to convert that into energy in the same units as \u0127. Oh wait, \u0127 has units of GeV\u00b7s or something? Let me think. The natural unit system often uses \u0127 = c = 1, but when calculating with SI units, I need to be careful.\n\nWait, \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, but converting eV to J: 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. So \u0127 is (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s) * (1.6e-19 J/eV)^-1 * (1 GeV = 1e9 eV) \u2192 but this might get messy. Alternatively, I remember that \u0127 c is about 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm, but maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe I should use natural units where \u0127 = c = 1. But in that case, the lifetime would be in inverse energy. So to get the lifetime in seconds, I need to multiply by \u0127. So let me see. Let's convert \u0393 into GeV.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = \u0127 / \u0393. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s. Let me compute that.\n\n6.582e-25 / 0.32 \u2248 (6.582 / 0.32) ) * 1e-25 = approximately 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 \u00d7 20 = 6.4. 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182. So 0.32 \u00d7 20.56875 = 6.582. So yes, 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo tau \u2248 2.057e-24 seconds.\n\nNow, the velocity v is approximately 0.9887c. So the mean decay length is L = gamma * v * c * tau. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The mean decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nBeta is v/c, so beta is 0.9887. So beta * gamma is (0.9887) * (6.6667). Let me compute that: 0.9887 * 6.6667 \u2248 approximately 6.6 (since 6.6667 * 0.9887 is roughly 6.6). Let me calculate it more accurately.\n\n6.6667 * 0.9887:\n\n6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.\n\n0.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.6591.\n\nSo total is approximately 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.\n\nSo beta * gamma \u2248 6.5913.\n\nThen, L = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nc is approximately 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nMultiply 6.5913 by 3e8: 6.5913 * 3e8 = 1.97739e9.\n\nThen multiply by 2.057e-24 s:\n\n1.97739e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.057) ) * 1e-15.\n\nCompute 1.97739 * 2.057: let's see.\n\n2 * 1.97739 \u2248 3.95478.\n\n0.057 * 1.97739 \u2248 approx 0.057 * 2 = 0.114, but let me do it more accurately:\n\n0.057 * 1.97739 = 0.112268.\n\nSo total is approx 3.95478 + 0.112268 = 4.06705.\n\nSo L \u2248 4.067e-15 meters.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact calculation. 1.97739 * 2.057.\n\nLet me compute 1.97739 * 2 = 3.95478.\n\n1.97739 * 0.057 = let's compute 1.97739 * 0.05 = 0.0988695 and 1.97739 * 0.007 = 0.01384173. Sum: 0.11271123.\n\nSo 3.95478 + 0.11271123 = 4.06749123.\n\nSo L = 4.0675e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15, which is about 5e-15, and option B is 4.0655e-15. Hmm, our calculation is about 4.0675e-15 m, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m. But wait, perhaps I made a slight approximation in the beta*gamma term.\n\nWait, let me double-check the beta*gamma calculation. Beta was approximately 0.9887, and gamma is 6.6667.\n\nBeta * gamma = 0.9887 * (8/1.2) = 0.9887 * (6.6666667) \u2248 let me compute this accurately.\n\n6.6666667 * 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.\n\n0.6666667 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.6666667 * 0.9887 = (2/3) * 0.9887 \u2248 0.6591.\n\nSo 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.\n\nSo beta*gamma \u2248 6.5913.\n\nThen, L = beta gamma * c tau.\n\nWait, c tau is the speed of light multiplied by the lifetime. Let me compute c * tau: 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = 6.171e-16 meters.\n\nThen, beta gamma * c tau = 6.5913 * 6.171e-16 m.\n\nCompute 6.5913 * 6.171e-16:\n\n6 * 6.171e-16 = 3.7026e-15.\n\n0.5913 * 6.171e-16 \u2248 3.652e-16.\n\nSo total is approximately 3.7026e-15 + 3.652e-16 = 3.7026 + 0.3652 = 4.0678e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's what I had before. So that's 4.0678e-15 meters, which is approximately 4.068e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption B is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nOption C is 5.0223e-15 m.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation of beta*gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps using more precise values for beta and gamma would get a more accurate result.\n\nLet me recalculate gamma. Gamma is E/(m c^2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) )= 8/1.2 = 6.666666666666667.\n\nBeta is v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nSo 1/gamma^2 is 1/(44.4444444) = 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(0.9775) = let me compute this accurately.\n\nsqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, but let's compute it more precisely.\n\n0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2.\n\n0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2*0.98*0.0087 = 2 * 0.008526 = 0.017052.\n\n0.0087^2 = 0.00007569.\n\nAdding up: 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452 + 0.00007569 = 0.97752769.\n\nBut 0.9775 is what we have. So 0.9887^2 is 0.97752769, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So perhaps beta is a bit less than 0.9887. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.\n\nAnother approach: Let me use the Taylor expansion or some approximation for sqrt near x=0.9775.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that 0.988^2 = (0.988)^2.\n\n0.988 * 0.988 = (1 - 0.012)^2 = 1 - 0.024 + 0.000144 = 0.976144.\n\nWait, that's less than 0.9775. So 0.988^2 is 0.976144, which is less than 0.9775.\n\nSo 0.988^2 = 0.976144.\n\nWhat about 0.989^2?\n\n(0.989)^2 = (0.98 + 0.009)^2 = 0.9604 + 2*0.98*0.009 + 0.009^2.\n\n= 0.9604 + 0.01764 + 0.000081 = 0.9604 + 0.01764 = 0.97804 + 0.000081 = 0.978121.\n\nWhich is higher than 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is between 0.988 and 0.989.\n\nLet me compute 0.9885^2.\n\n0.9885 * 0.9885.\n\n= (0.988 + 0.0005)^2.\n\n= 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.\n\n= 0.976144 + 0.000988 + 0.00000025 = 0.97713225.\n\nStill less than 0.9775.\n\n0.9886^2:\n\n= (0.9885 + 0.0001)^2 = 0.97713225 + 2*0.9885*0.0001 + 0.00000001.\n\n= 0.97713225 + 0.0001977 + 0.00000001 \u2248 0.97732996.\n\nStill less than 0.9775.\n\n0.9887^2: as we saw earlier, about 0.97752769.\n\nWhich is a bit higher than 0.9775.\n\nSo sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.98865.\n\nSo beta is approximately 0.98865.\n\nSo beta * gamma is 0.98865 * 6.666666667.\n\nLet me compute that more accurately.\n\n0.98865 * 6.666666667.\n\n= 0.98865 * (20/3) = (0.98865 * 20) / 3.\n\n0.98865 * 20 = 19.773.\n\n19.773 / 3 = 6.591.\n\nSo beta*gamma is approximately 6.591.\n\nSo L = beta gamma * c tau.\n\nc tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = 6.171e-16 m.\n\nSo L = 6.591 * 6.171e-16 m.\n\nCompute 6.591 * 6.171e-16.\n\n6 * 6.171e-16 = 3.7026e-15.\n\n0.591 * 6.171e-16 = let's compute 0.5 * 6.171e-16 = 3.0855e-16, and 0.091 * 6.171e-16 \u2248 5.619e-17.\n\nAdding those: 3.0855e-16 + 5.619e-17 = 3.6474e-16.\n\nSo total L = 3.7026e-15 + 3.6474e-16 = 3.7026e-15 + 0.36474e-15 = (3.7026 + 0.36474) e-15 = 4.06734e-15 m.\n\nSo approximately 4.0673e-15 m. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating tau. Let me double-check that.\n\nTau is \u0127 / \u0393. So \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. \u0393 is 0.32 GeV. So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?\n\n6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875.\n\nSo tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what about the calculation of c * tau?\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nc * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen, beta gamma is 6.591, so L = 6.591 * 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nCompute 6.591 * 6.170625e-16.\n\n6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.591 * 6.170625e-16 = let's calculate:\n\n0.5 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.0853125e-16.\n\n0.091 * 6.170625e-16 = 0.091 * 6.170625 = approx 0.561666...e-16.\n\nSo 3.0853125e-16 + 0.561666e-16 = 3.646978e-16.\n\nSo total L = 3.702375e-15 + 3.646978e-16 = 4.067073e-15 m.\n\nWhich is about 4.067e-15 m. So the option closest is B: 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, a slight discrepancy. Maybe I made a miscalculation in beta*gamma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using more precise values for \u0127.\n\nWait, \u0127 is 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo tau = \u0127 / \u0393 = 6.582e-25 / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 s.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.\n\nSo tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute beta*gamma more accurately.\n\nBeta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).\n\ngamma = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 \u22486.666666666666667.\n\ngamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u224844.4444444444.\n\nSo 1/(gamma^2) is 9/400 = 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 0.9775.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(0.9775) = approx 0.988675.\n\nSo beta * gamma = 0.988675 * 6.666666666666667.\n\nCompute that: 0.988675 * 6.666666666666667.\n\n= 0.988675 * (20/3) = (0.988675 *20)/3 = 19.7735 /3 = 6.591166666666666666666666666...\n\nSo beta*gamma \u22486.5911666666666666667.\n\nThen, L = 6.591166666666667 * c * tau.\n\nc * tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nSo L = 6.591166666666667 * 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nCompute 6 *6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.591166666666667 *6.170625e-16 = let's compute:\n\n0.5 *6.170625e-16=3.0853125e-16.\n\n0.091166666666667 *6.170625e-16.\n\nCompute 0.09 *6.170625e-16 = 0.55535625e-16.\n\n0.001166666666667 *6.170625e-16 \u22487.189e-19.\n\nSo 0.091166666666667 *6.170625e-16 \u22480.55535625e-16 + 7.189e-19 = approx 0.55607515e-16.\n\nSo total 0.5 part is 3.0853125e-16, plus 0.55607515e-16 = 3.64138765e-16.\n\nSo L =3.702375e-15 +3.64138765e-16 = (3.702375 +0.364138765)e-15 = 4.066513765e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.0665e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close, so perhaps I should choose that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation expects us to approximate beta*gamma as 6.59, leading to 6.59 *6.170625e-16 = ?\n\n6 *6.170625e-16 =3.702375e-15.\n\n0.59 *6.170625e-16 = 3.63062e-16.\n\nSo 3.702375e-15 +3.63062e-16 = 4.065437e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.0654e-15 m, which matches option B exactly (4.0655e-15 m).\n\nAh, so that's why option B is the correct answer.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nL = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\beta = v/c \\), \\( \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m c^2} \\), \\( c \\) is the speed of light, and \\( \\tau \\) is the lifetime of the particle.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.\n\nThe question says X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances usually refer to unstable particles that don't exist for very long, right? So their decay distance would depend on how long they live before decaying.\n\nThe problem gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, which are really tiny distances, so I think this involves some quantum mechanics or particle physics concepts.\n\nWait, mean decay distance... I think it's related to the particle's lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. So the mean decay distance would be the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. But how do I find the lifetime?\n\nOh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (\u0394t) is approximately \u0127 (the reduced Planck constant). But in particle physics, the width \u0393 is related to the lifetime \u03c4 by \u0393 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4. So \u03c4 is \u0127 divided by \u0393.\n\nWait, let me get that straight. The natural linewidth or width \u0393 is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4. Therefore, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nOnce I have the lifetime, I can find the decay distance. The decay distance L would be the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime \u03c4. So L = v * \u03c4.\n\nBut wait, the velocity of the particle. How do I find that? The particle is produced with a certain energy, which is given as E_X =8 GeV. But the mass is 1.2 GeV. So I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation to find the velocity.\n\nThe total energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2. Let's compute p.\n\nSo E =8 GeV, m =1.2 GeV. Let me convert GeV to Joules for calculations, but maybe I can work in natural units where c=1 and \u0127=1 to simplify. Hmm, but perhaps it's better to calculate in terms of units that can give me the velocity in terms of c.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute beta, which is v/c. Because in relativity, beta is often used as v = \u03b2c.\n\nSo, let's compute beta (\u03b2) as the ratio of momentum to energy. Wait, no. The correct formula is \u03b2 = p c / E. Because E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and p = \u03b3 m v, so v = (p c\u00b2) / (E). So \u03b2 = v/c = (p c) / E.\n\nSo I can find p from E and m. Let's compute p.\n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nLet me rearrange this to solve for pc:\n\n(pc)\u00b2 = E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nTaking square root,\n\npc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2).\n\nBut since I'm working in units where c is a constant, maybe I can just compute (pc) as sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2), but I need to make sure the units are consistent.\n\nWait, let's do this properly. Let me convert E and m into the same units. Let's use GeV and GeV/c\u00b2 for mass. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So m c\u00b2 is 1.2 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\n(pc)^2 = (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 = (64 - 1.44) GeV\u00b2 = 62.56 GeV\u00b2.\n\nSo pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo, p = (7.91 GeV) / c.\n\nNow, beta (\u03b2) = (pc) / E = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) \u2248 0.98875.\n\nSo \u03b2 \u2248 0.98875, which is about 0.989c.\n\nSo v \u2248 0.989c.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should compute this more accurately. Let me calculate 7.91 /8 = 0.98875. So yes, beta is approximately 0.98875.\n\nNow, the lifetime \u03c4 is \u0127 / \u0393. Wait, but \u0393 is given in MeV. Let me convert \u0393 into GeV. \u0393 = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u0393 = 0.32 GeV. Now, \u0127 in units of GeV\u00b7s. I remember that \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Let me confirm that: yes, because Planck constant h is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, and \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0), so about 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. But when converted into GeV\u00b7s, since 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 1 GeV is 1.6e-10 J. So, \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 /0.32 ) * 1e-25 s \u2248 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, wait, no: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875e-25 s? No, wait: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 /0.32 ) * 1e-25 = approx 20.56875 * 1e-25 s.\n\nWait, 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 * 20 =6.4. 6.582 -6.4=0.182 left. 0.182 /0.32 = approx 0.56875. So yes, 20.56875e-25 s. So \u03c4 \u2248 2.056875e-24 s? Wait, no, wait: 20.56875e-25 s is the same as 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, but 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s. Yes.\n\nSo \u03c4 \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nNow, the decay distance L is v * \u03c4. v is \u03b2c, so L = \u03b2 c \u03c4.\n\nCompute this:\n\n\u03b2 = 0.98875,\n\nc is approximately 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 0.98875 *3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nThen, multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:\n\n2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 m.\n\nCalculate 2.966 * 2.056875.\n\nHmm, 2.966 * 2 = 5.932,\n\n2.966 * 0.056875 \u2248 0.1684.\n\nSo total is approximately 5.932 + 0.1684 = 6.1004.\n\nSo 6.1004e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nA) 5.0223 *1e-16 m\n\nB)4.0655e-15\n\nC)5.0223e-15\n\nD)4.0655e-16\n\nHmm, none of these match 6.1e-16. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation for beta. Let me double-check the beta calculation.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So, E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.\n\nSo (pc)^2 = 8\u00b2 -1.2\u00b2 =64 -1.44=62.56 (GeV)^2.\n\nSo pc = sqrt(62.56) = approx 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo beta = (pc)/(E) =7.91 /8 = 0.98875. That part seems correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake with the calculation of the lifetime.\n\nWait, \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So in the calculation, \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393).\n\nWait, I used \u0127 =6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Let me confirm that value.\n\nYes, because \u0127 in J\u00b7s is about 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. And since 1 GeV is 1.60218e-10 J, then 1 GeV\u00b7s is 1.60218e-10 J\u00b7s. So,\n\n\u0127 in GeV\u00b7s = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1.60218e-10 J/GeV) ) \u2248 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. That seems correct.\n\nSo \u03c4 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That seems right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the relativistic lifetime. Because the lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor gamma.\n\nWait a second, no. Because tau is the lifetime in the rest frame. Or wait, is the width \u0393 the total decay width, which is related to the proper lifetime. Because the width is given as \u0393, so the relation is \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4, where \u03c4 is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). But in the lab frame, the lifetime observed is longer by gamma, so the mean decay length would be v * gamma tau.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I messed that up. Let me think again.\n\nThe width \u0393 is related to the proper lifetime \u03c4_0: \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4_0.\n\nBut when the particle is moving with velocity v, its lifetime in the lab frame is dilated: \u03c4 = gamma * tau_0.\n\nSo the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma, so the decay distance is v * gamma tau_0.\n\nWait, no. Because tau_0 is the proper lifetime, and in the lab frame, tau = gamma tau_0.\n\nSo the decay length L = v * tau = v gamma tau_0.\n\nBut tau_0 is \u0127/(Gamma), so:\n\nL = v gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in considering whether tau is the proper time or not. Let me clarify.\n\nThe width \u0393 is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime in the rest frame. So \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4_0. So the mean lifetime in the rest frame is \u03c4_0 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nWhen the particle is moving, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0.\n\nSo the decay length is v * tau = v gamma tau_0 = v gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nBut earlier, I didn't include the gamma factor. Oh! So that's where I went wrong. I only calculated v * tau_0, but I should have multiplied by gamma.\n\nSo I need to calculate gamma, the Lorentz factor.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).\n\nBeta is 0.98875. So beta squared is about (0.98875)^2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.98875^2 = (1 - 0.01125)^2 \u2248 1 - 2 * 0.01125 + (0.01125)^2 \u2248 0.97771875.\n\nSo 1 - beta^2 \u2248 1 - 0.97771875 = 0.02228125.\n\nsqrt(0.02228125) \u2248 0.14927.\n\nSo gamma = 1 / 0.14927 \u2248 6.69.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately.\n\nCompute beta = 0.98875.\n\nbeta^2 = (0.98875)^2 = let's compute it as (0.98 + 0.00875)^2.\n\n0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n0.00875^2 \u2248 0.00007656.\n\nCross terms: 2*0.98 *0.00875= 0.01715.\n\nSo total beta^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01715 + 0.00007656 \u2248 0.97762656.\n\nSo 1 - beta^2 = 1 - 0.97762656 = 0.02237344.\n\nsqrt(0.02237344) \u2248 0.149578.\n\nSo gamma is 1 / 0.149578 \u2248 6.685.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 6.685.\n\nSo now, L = v gamma tau_0.\n\nBut v is beta c, and tau_0 is \u0127/(Gamma).\n\nSo L = beta c * gamma * (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nbeta = 0.98875,\n\ngamma \u22486.685,\n\n\u0127 =6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s,\n\nGamma =0.32 GeV,\n\nc =3e8 m/s.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.98875 * 6.685 * (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV) * 3e8 m/s.\n\nWait, let me break that down.\n\nFirst, compute the terms step by step.\n\nCompute gamma * beta:\n\ngamma * beta = 6.685 * 0.98875 \u2248 approx 6.685 * 0.98875.\n\nLet me compute that: 6.685 *0.98 =6.5513, 6.685*0.00875= approx 0.05848. So total is about 6.6098.\n\nSo gamma beta \u22486.61.\n\nNow, (gamma beta) * (\u0127 / Gamma) = 6.61 * (6.582e-25 /0.32).\n\nCompute 6.582e-25 /0.32 = approx 20.56875e-25.\n\nSo 6.61 * 20.56875e-25 \u2248 136.2e-25 = 1.362e-23.\n\nMultiply by c (3e8 m/s):\n\n1.362e-23 *3e8 = 4.086e-15 meters.\n\nWait, that's 4.086e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me recompute that precisely.\n\nWait, let me redo the calculation step by step.\n\ngamma =6.685.\n\nbeta=0.98875.\n\ngamma * beta =6.685 * 0.98875.\n\nCompute 6 *0.98875=5.9325.\n\n0.685 *0.98875: 0.6 *0.98875=0.59325, 0.08 *0.98875=0.0791, 0.005 *0.98875=0.00494375. So sum: 0.59325 +0.0791=0.67235 +0.00494375=0.67729375.\n\nTotal gamma beta =5.9325 +0.67729375=6.60979375.\n\nSo gamma beta \u22486.60979375.\n\nNow, (gamma beta) * (\u0127 / Gamma) =6.60979375 * (6.582e-25 /0.32).\n\nCompute 6.582e-25 /0.32 = 20.56875e-25.\n\nMultiply by 6.60979375:\n\n6.60979375 *20.56875e-25 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6.60979375 *20.56875 = ?\n\nCompute 6 *20.56875=123.4125.\n\n0.60979375 *20.56875 \u2248 12.56 (since 0.6 *20.56875=12.34125; 0.00979375 *20.56875\u22480.201).\n\nSo total \u2248123.4125 +12.34125 +0.201 \u2248 135.95475.\n\nSo approximately 135.955e-25 = 1.35955e-23.\n\nMultiply by c =3e8 m/s:\n\n1.35955e-23 *3e8 = 4.07865e-15 meters.\n\nHmm, that's approximately 4.079e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Close, but not exactly. Maybe due to more precise calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places.\n\nLet me recompute gamma * beta accurately.\n\ngamma =6.685.\n\nbeta =0.98875.\n\ngamma * beta =6.685 *0.98875.\n\nCalculating:\n\n6.685 *0.98875.\n\nLet me compute 6.685 * (1 - 0.01125) )=6.685 - (6.685 *0.01125).\n\nCompute 6.685 *0.01125:\n\n0.01 *6.685=0.06685.\n\n0.00125 *6.685=0.00835625.\n\nSo 0.06685 +0.00835625=0.07520625.\n\nSo 6.685 -0.07520625 =6.60979375.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nNow, compute (6.60979375) * (6.582e-25 /0.32) =6.60979375 * (20.56875e-25).\n\nWait, 20.56875e-25 =2.056875e-24.\n\n6.60979375 *2.056875e-24 = ?\n\nCompute 6 *2.056875e-24 =1.234125e-23.\n\n0.60979375 *2.056875e-24 = ?\n\n0.6 *2.056875e-24 =1.234125e-24.\n\n0.00979375 *2.056875e-24 \u2248 2.013e-26.\n\nSo total is 1.234125e-23 +1.234125e-24 +2.013e-26.\n\nConvert to same exponent:\n\n1.234125e-23 =12.34125e-24.\n\n1.234125e-24 =1.234125e-24.\n\n2.013e-26 =0.02013e-24.\n\nAdding them: 12.34125 +1.234125 +0.02013 =13.5955e-24.\n\nSo 13.5955e-24 =1.35955e-23.\n\nMultiply by c (3e8 m/s):\n\n1.35955e-23 *3e8 =4.07865e-15 m.\n\nWait, but the option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Close, but not exactly. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nWait, beta is 0.98875, so beta squared is (0.98875)^2.\n\nLet me compute that precisely.\n\n0.98875 *0.98875.\n\n= (0.98 + 0.00875) * (0.98 +0.00875)\n\n= 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.00875 + 0.00875^2\n\n= 0.9604 + 0.01715 + 0.0000765625\n\n= 0.9604 +0.01715=0.97755 + 0.0000765625=0.9776265625.\n\nSo 1 - beta^2 =1 -0.9776265625=0.0223734375.\n\nsqrt(0.0223734375) = ?\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.0223734375).\n\nI know that 0.15^2 =0.0225, which is a bit higher than 0.0223734.\n\nSo 0.15^2 =0.0225.\n\n0.149^2= (0.15 -0.001)^2=0.0225 - 2*0.15*0.001 +0.000001=0.0225 -0.0003 +0.000001=0.02220001.\n\nHmm, 0.149^2=0.02220001, which is less than 0.0223734.\n\n0.1495^2: (0.149 +0.0005)^2 =0.149^2 + 2*0.149*0.0005 +0.00000025.\n\n=0.02220001 + 0.000149 +0.00000025=0.0223490125.\n\nStill less than 0.0223734375.\n\n0.1496^2: (0.1495 +0.0001)^2 =0.1495^2 + 2*0.1495*0.0001 +0.00000001.\n\n=0.0223490125 +0.0000299 +0.00000001\u22480.0223789.\n\nBut our target is 0.0223734375, which is between 0.1495^2 (0.0223490125) and 0.1496^2 (0.0223789).\n\nThe difference between 0.0223734375 and 0.0223490125 is about 0.000024425.\n\nThe difference between 0.1496^2 and 0.1495^2 is 0.0000299.\n\nSo, 0.000024425 /0.0000299 \u2248 0.816. So sqrt is approximately 0.1495 +0.816*(0.0001) =0.1495816.\n\nSo sqrt(0.0223734375)\u22480.1495816.\n\nSo gamma=1/0.1495816\u22486.6855.\n\nHmm, more accurately, 1/0.1495816 is approximately 6.6855.\n\nSo gamma=6.6855.\n\nNow, recalculating gamma * beta: 6.6855 *0.98875.\n\nCompute 6.6855 *0.98875.\n\n=6.6855*(1 -0.01125) =6.6855 -6.6855*0.01125.\n\nCompute 6.6855 *0.01125: 0.07534875.\n\nSo gamma * beta=6.6855 -0.07534875=6.61015125.\n\nSo now, (gamma beta) =6.61015125.\n\nNow, (gamma beta) * (\u0127 / Gamma) =6.61015125 * (6.582e-25 /0.32).\n\nCompute 6.582e-25 /0.32=20.56875e-25.\n\nSo 6.61015125 *20.56875e-25= ?\n\nCompute 6 *20.56875e-25=123.4125e-25.\n\n0.61015125 *20.56875e-25.\n\nCompute 0.6 *20.56875e-25=12.34125e-25.\n\n0.01015125 *20.56875e-25\u22480.2085e-25.\n\nSo sum:123.4125e-25 +12.34125e-25 +0.2085e-25 =135.96225e-25 =1.3596225e-23.\n\nMultiply by c (3e8 m/s):\n\n1.3596225e-23 *3e8 =4.0788675e-15 m.\n\nHmm, that's approximately 4.0789e-15 m.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m.\n\nHmm, 4.0789e-15 is close to 4.0655e-15, but not exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere, perhaps in the value of \u0127.\n\nWait, let me double-check the value of \u0127. I used 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, but perhaps it's more precise. Let me look up the exact value.\n\nThe exact value of \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s is approximately 6.582 \u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is due to the approximation of gamma. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation expects us to use the relativistic expression for lifetime without considering gamma, which would give a different result.\n\nWait, earlier I didn't include gamma and got 6.1e-16, but the options don't have that. Then when including gamma, I got 4.07e-15, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15). Maybe with more precise calculations, it aligns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the correct formula. Let me think about it again.\n\nWait, another approach: the mean path L is given by L = (c * tau) * beta gamma.\n\nBecause tau is the proper lifetime, the observed lifetime is tau_obs = tau * gamma.\n\nSo, L = v * tau_obs = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nBut tau is the proper lifetime, which is \u0127/(Gamma).\n\nSo,\n\nL = beta c gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation should use natural units and then convert to meters.\n\nWait, another approach: using natural units where c=1, \u0127=1.\n\nIn natural units, the decay length is L = beta gamma tau.\n\nBut tau is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nWait, in natural units, \u0127=1, so tau =1/Gamma.\n\nWait, but units can be tricky. Alternatively, let's compute everything in natural units and then convert to meters.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute everything in terms of GeV and inverse GeV, then convert to meters.\n\nLet me try this.\n\nIn natural units (c=1, \u0127=1), the mean lifetime tau is 1/Gamma.\n\nSo tau =1/(0.32 GeV).\n\nBut to convert tau from inverse GeV to seconds: since 1 GeV = 1.60218e-10 J, and \u0127=6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, so 1 GeV^{-1} = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) * (1 GeV^{-1}) ) =6.582e-25 s.\n\nWait, because 1 GeV^{-1} = (\u0127 c )/(1 GeV) * (1/(c^2)) ), but perhaps it's easier to think that in natural units, 1 GeV^{-1} corresponds to 6.582e-25 s.\n\nSo tau =1/(0.32 GeV) = (1/0.32) *6.582e-25 s \u224820.56875e-25 s=2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, same as before.\n\nNow, the observed lifetime in the lab frame is tau_lab = gamma tau.\n\nSo L = beta c tau_lab = beta c gamma tau.\n\nWhich again brings us back to the same formula.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate everything accurately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial approach of not considering the gamma factor was wrong, and the correct formula includes gamma.\n\nWait, let's think about the decay width and lifetime. The decay width \u0393 is related to the mean lifetime \u03c4 (proper time) as \u0393 = \u0127/\u03c4. So \u03c4 = \u0127/\u0393.\n\nIn the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, so the mean decay length is L = v * gamma tau = beta c gamma tau.\n\nSo, with tau = \u0127/(Gamma), we have L = beta c gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nSo, substituting the numbers:\n\nbeta =0.98875,\n\ngamma \u22486.685,\n\n\u0127=6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s,\n\nGamma=0.32 GeV,\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\nSo,\n\nL =0.98875 * 6.685 * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) *3e8.\n\nCompute each part:\n\nCompute 0.98875 *6.685 = approx 6.6098.\n\nCompute 6.582e-25 /0.32=20.56875e-25.\n\nMultiply 6.6098 *20.56875e-25 =136.2e-25=1.362e-23.\n\nMultiply by 3e8 m/s: 1.362e-23 *3e8 =4.086e-15 m.\n\nHmm, same result as before.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nHmm, perhaps the precise calculation with more accurate gamma would yield exactly option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nCompute gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).\n\nbeta =0.98875.\n\nbeta^2 = (0.98875)^2 =0.9776265625.\n\nSo 1 - beta^2=0.0223734375.\n\nsqrt(0.0223734375) = sqrt(223734375e-11) ?\n\nAlternatively, compute sqrt(0.0223734375) precisely.\n\nLet me compute it as follows:\n\nWe can write 0.0223734375 =223734375e-11.\n\nBut perhaps using a calculator approach.\n\nWe know that 0.1495^2=0.02235025.\n\nWait, 0.1495^2= (0.149)^2 + 2*0.149*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.\n\nWait, 0.149^2=0.022201.\n\n2*0.149 *0.0005=0.000149.\n\n(0.0005)^2=0.00000025.\n\nSo 0.022201 +0.000149 =0.02235 +0.00000025=0.02235025.\n\nSo 0.1495^2=0.02235025.\n\nOur target is 0.0223734375, which is larger.\n\nThe difference between target and 0.02235025 is 0.0000231875.\n\nWe can use linear approximation.\n\nLet x =0.1495,\n\nf(x) =x^2=0.02235025.\n\nWe need f(x + delta) =0.0223734375.\n\ndelta \u2248 (0.0223734375 -0.02235025)/(2x) )= (0.0000231875)/(2 *0.1495)= 0.0000231875/(0.299)\u22480.0000775.\n\nSo x + delta \u22480.1495 +0.0000775=0.1495775.\n\nSo sqrt(0.0223734375)\u22480.1495775.\n\nThus, gamma=1/0.1495775\u22486.6855.\n\nSo gamma=6.6855.\n\nNow, beta * gamma =0.98875 *6.6855.\n\nCompute 0.98875 *6.6855.\n\nLet me compute 6.6855 *0.98875.\n\n=6.6855*(1 - 0.01125) =6.6855 - (6.6855 *0.01125).\n\nCompute 6.6855 *0.01125:\n\n6.6855 *0.01 =0.066855.\n\n6.6855 *0.00125=0.008356875.\n\nSo total is 0.066855 +0.008356875=0.075211875.\n\nSo 6.6855 -0.075211875=6.610288125.\n\nSo beta gamma=6.610288125.\n\nNow, compute beta gamma * (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\n=6.610288125 * (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s /0.32 GeV )\n\n=6.610288125 * (20.56875e-25 s)\n\n=6.610288125 *20.56875e-25 = 136.2e-25=1.362e-23 s.\n\nMultiply by c=3e8 m/s:\n\n1.362e-23 s *3e8 m/s=4.086e-15 m.\n\nHmm, same result as before.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option B:4.0655e-15 m.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact calculation would give 4.0655e-15 m. Maybe I'm missing something in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the formula.\n\nWait, another approach: calculate the velocity using E and m, then find gamma, then compute L.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that I'm using GeV and not converting correctly. Let me re-express the decay width in the correct units.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for decay length is L = (c * \u0127) / (Gamma * m) ) * beta gamma.\n\nWait, no, perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of the formula for the decay length: L = (c * tau) * beta gamma.\n\nWhich is what I've been using.\n\nBut let me see if I can find a formula that might lead to the options given.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation expects the use of the natural unit conversion where c=3e8 m/s and \u0127=6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, let me compute everything in terms of GeV and then convert.\n\nCompute L = beta gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma ) * c.\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.\n\nBut perhaps the calculation should be:\n\nL = (beta gamma) * ( \u0127 c ) / Gamma.\n\nBecause c is in m/s, and \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, let's compute ( \u0127 c ) =6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s =1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m.\n\nBecause 6.582e-25 *3e8= (6.582 *3) *1e-17 =19.746e-17 =1.9746e-16.\n\nSo,\n\nL = (beta gamma) * (1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m ) / (Gamma GeV )\n\n= (beta gamma) * (1.9746e-16 m ) / (Gamma )\n\nGamma is in GeV, so units cancel.\n\nSo,\n\nL= (beta gamma) * (1.9746e-16 m ) / 0.32 GeV.\n\nWait, no, because (1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m ) / (0.32 GeV ) = (1.9746e-16 /0.32 ) m \u22486.1706e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by beta gamma=6.610288.\n\nSo,\n\nL\u22486.610288 *6.1706e-16 m \u22484.086e-15 m.\n\nSame result again.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the correct answer is option B:4.0655e-15 m.\n\nWait, but why is my calculation giving 4.086e-15 and the option is 4.0655e-15?\n\nAh, perhaps the exact calculation with precise gamma and beta would give that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(1 - beta^2) with more precision.\n\nBeta=0.98875.\n\nBeta squared=0.9776265625.\n\n1 - beta^2=0.0223734375.\n\nCompute sqrt(0.0223734375).\n\nLet me use more precise method.\n\nWe can use the Newton-Raphson method to compute sqrt(0.0223734375).\n\nLet x0=0.1495.\n\nx0^2=0.02235025.\n\nf(x)=x^2 -0.0223734375=0.\n\nf'(x)=2x.\n\nCompute f(x0)=0.02235025 -0.0223734375= -0.0000231875.\n\nNext approximation: x1 =x0 - f(x0)/(2x0) )=0.1495 - (-0.0000231875)/(2*0.1495).\n\n=0.1495 + 0.0000231875/(0.299).\n\nCompute 0.0000231875 /0.299 \u22487.7525e-5.\n\nSo x1=0.1495 +0.000077525=0.149577525.\n\nCompute x1^2= (0.149577525)^2.\n\n=0.149577525 *0.149577525.\n\nCompute:\n\n0.1495 *0.1495 =0.02235025.\n\nNow, 0.149577525 =0.1495 +0.000077525.\n\nSo (a +b)^2 =a^2 + 2ab +b^2.\n\na=0.1495, b=0.000077525.\n\na^2=0.02235025.\n\n2ab=2 *0.1495 *0.000077525 \u22480.00002319.\n\nb^2\u2248(0.000077525)^2\u22486.01e-9.\n\nSo total x1^2=0.02235025 +0.00002319 +6.01e-9 \u22480.02237344.\n\nWhich is very close to our target 0.0223734375.\n\nSo sqrt(0.0223734375)=x1\u22480.149577525.\n\nSo gamma=1/x1\u22481/0.149577525\u22486.68555.\n\nSo gamma=6.68555.\n\nNow, beta gamma=0.98875 *6.68555.\n\nCompute 0.98875 *6.68555.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n0.98875 *6=5.9325.\n\n0.98875 *0.68555= ?\n\nCompute 0.98875 *0.6=0.59325.\n\n0.98875 *0.08=0.0791.\n\n0.98875 *0.00555= approx 0.005489.\n\nAdding these: 0.59325 +0.0791=0.67235 +0.005489=0.677839.\n\nSo total beta gamma=5.9325 +0.677839=6.610339.\n\nNow, compute L= beta gamma * ( \u0127 c ) / Gamma.\n\n( \u0127 c )=6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s *3e8 m/s =1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m.\n\nGamma=0.32 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL=6.610339 * (1.9746e-16 m ) /0.32.\n\nCompute 1.9746e-16 /0.32=6.170625e-16.\n\nMultiply by 6.610339: 6.610339 *6.170625e-16 \u22484.086e-15 m.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nBut the option is 4.0655e-15, which is a bit lower.

No, 6.1e-16 is not an option. The options have 5.02e-16 as option A.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to compute L = (c * tau) * beta.\n\nBut that would be without considering gamma, which is incorrect.\n\nSo I'm confident that including gamma gives L\u22484.08e-15 m, but the closest option is B:4.0655e-15 m.\n\nPerhaps the exact calculation gives that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the error comes from using GeV and not MeV correctly.\n\nWait, Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the full expression without approximations.\n\nL = (beta gamma) * ( \u0127 c ) / (Gamma )\n\n= (beta gamma) * (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s *3e8 m/s) / (0.32 GeV )\n\n= (beta gamma) * (1.9746e-16 m) /0.32\n\n= (beta gamma) *6.170625e-16 m.\n\nNow, compute beta gamma accurately.\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 )).\n\nWait, E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4 )/(E^2 )) = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2 )) = sqrt(1 -1.44/64)=sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=approx 0.9887.\n\nWait, precise calculation:\n\n1.2^2=1.44.\n\n8^2=64.\n\n1.44/64=0.0225.\n\n1-0.0225=0.9775.\n\nsqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately.\n\nCompute sqrt(0.9775).\n\nWe know that 0.988^2=0.976144.\n\n0.989^2=0.978121.\n\n0.9885^2= (0.988 +0.0005)^2=0.988\u00b2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 +0.00000025=0.976144 +0.000988 +0.00000025=0.97713225.\n\nWait, 0.9885^2=0.97713225.\n\nWhich is less than 0.9775.\n\nThe difference is 0.9775 -0.97713225=0.00036775.\n\nSo, how much more than 0.9885 do we need?\n\nLet me compute (0.9885 + x)^2 =0.9775.\n\nExpanding: (0.9885)^2 + 2*0.9885 x +x^2 =0.9775.\n\nWe have 0.97713225 + 1.977 x +x^2 =0.9775.\n\nAssume x is small, so x^2 negligible.\n\nSo 1.977 x \u22480.00036775.\n\nx\u22480.00036775/1.977\u22480.0001863.\n\nSo sqrt(0.9775)=0.9885 +0.0001863\u22480.9886863.\n\nSo beta\u22480.9886863.\n\nNow, compute gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).\n\nWe have beta^2=0.9775.\n\nSo 1 - beta^2=0.0225.\n\nsqrt(0.0225)=0.15.\n\nSo gamma=1/0.15\u22486.6666667.\n\nWait, this is a big change. So if beta^2=0.9775, then 1-beta^2=0.0225, whose square root is 0.15.\n\nSo gamma=1/0.15=6.6666667.\n\nWait, wait a second. That's a different approach. Let me see.\n\nEarlier, I computed beta as sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 )).\n\nWhich is correct.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.\n\nThe question says X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances usually refer to unstable particles that don't exist for very long, right? So their decay distance would depend on how long they live before decaying.\n\nThe problem gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, which are really tiny distances, so I think this involves some quantum mechanics or particle physics concepts.\n\nWait, mean decay distance... I think it's related to the particle's lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. So the mean decay distance would be the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. But how do I find the lifetime?\n\nOh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (\u0394t) is approximately \u0127 (the reduced Planck constant). But in particle physics, the width \u0393 is related to the lifetime \u03c4 by \u0393 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4. So \u03c4 is \u0127 divided by \u0393.\n\nWait, let me get that straight. The natural linewidth or width \u0393 is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4. Therefore, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nOnce I have the lifetime, I can find the decay distance. The decay distance L would be the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime \u03c4. So L = v * \u03c4.\n\nBut wait, the velocity of the particle. How do I find that? The particle is produced with a certain energy, which is given as E_X =8 GeV. But the mass is 1.2 GeV. So I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation to find the velocity.\n\nThe total energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2. Let's compute p.\n\nSo E =8 GeV, m =1.2 GeV. Let me convert GeV to Joules for calculations, but maybe I can work in natural units where c=1 and \u0127=1 to simplify. Hmm, but perhaps it's better to calculate in terms of units that can give me the velocity in terms of c.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute beta, which is v/c. Because in relativity, beta is often used as v = \u03b2c.\n\nSo, let's compute beta (\u03b2) as the ratio of momentum to energy. Wait, no. The correct formula is \u03b2 = p c / E. Because E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and p = \u03b3 m v, so v = (p c\u00b2) / (E). So \u03b2 = v/c = (p c) / E.\n\nSo I can find p from E and m. Let's compute p.\n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nLet me rearrange this to solve for pc:\n\n(pc)\u00b2 = E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nTaking square root,\n\npc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2).\n\nBut since I'm working in units where c is a constant, maybe I can just compute (pc) as sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2), but I need to make sure the units are consistent.\n\nWait, let's do this properly. Let me convert E and m into the same units. Let's use GeV and GeV/c\u00b2 for mass. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So m c\u00b2 is 1.2 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\n(pc)^2 = (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 = (64 - 1.44) GeV\u00b2 = 62.56 GeV\u00b2.\n\nSo pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo, p = (7.91 GeV) / c.\n\nNow, beta (\u03b2) = (pc) / E = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) \u2248 0.98875.\n\nSo \u03b2 \u2248 0.98875, which is about 0.989c.\n\nSo v \u2248 0.989c.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should compute this more accurately. Let me calculate 7.91 /8 = 0.98875. So yes, beta is approximately 0.98875.\n\nNow, the lifetime \u03c4 is \u0127 / \u0393. Wait, but \u0393 is given in MeV. Let me convert \u0393 into GeV. \u0393 = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u0393 = 0.32 GeV. Now, \u0127 in units of GeV\u00b7s. I remember that \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Let me confirm that: yes, because Planck constant h is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, and \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0), so about 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. But when converted into GeV\u00b7s, since 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 1 GeV is 1.6e-10 J. So, \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 /0.32 ) * 1e-25 s \u2248 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, wait, no: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875e-25 s? No, wait: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 /0.32 ) * 1e-25 = approx 20.56875 * 1e-25 s.\n\nWait, 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 * 20 =6.4. 6.582 -6.4=0.182 left. 0.182 /0.32 = approx 0.56875. So yes, 20.56875e-25 s. So \u03c4 \u2248 2.056875e-24 s? Wait, no, wait: 20.56875e-25 s is the same as 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, but 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s. Yes.\n\nSo \u03c4 \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nNow, the decay distance L is v * \u03c4. v is \u03b2c, so L = \u03b2 c \u03c4.\n\nCompute this:\n\n\u03b2 = 0.98875,\n\nc is approximately 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 0.98875 *3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nThen, multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:\n\n2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 m.\n\nCalculate 2.966 * 2.056875.\n\nHmm, 2.966 * 2 = 5.932,\n\n2.966 * 0.056875 \u2248 0.1684.\n\nSo total is approximately 5.932 + 0.1684 = 6.1004.\n\nSo 6.1004e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nA) 5.0223 *1e-16 m\n\nB)4.0655e-15\n\nC)5.0223e-15\n\nD)4.0655e-16\n\nHmm, none of these match 6.1e-16. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation for beta. Let me double-check the beta calculation.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So, E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.\n\nSo (pc)^2 = 8\u00b2 -1.2\u00b2 =64 -1.44=62.56 (GeV)^2.\n\nSo pc = sqrt(62.56) = approx 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo beta = (pc)/(E) =7.91 /8 = 0.98875. That part seems correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake with the calculation of the lifetime.\n\nWait, \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So in the calculation, \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393).\n\nWait, I used \u0127 =6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Let me confirm that value.\n\nYes, because \u0127 in J\u00b7s is about 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. And since 1 GeV is 1.60218e-10 J, then 1 GeV\u00b7s is 1.60218e-10 J\u00b7s. So,\n\n\u0127 in GeV\u00b7s = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1.60218e-10 J/GeV) ) \u2248 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. That seems correct.\n\nSo \u03c4 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That seems right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the relativistic lifetime. Because the lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor gamma.\n\nWait a second, no. Because tau is the lifetime in the rest frame. Or wait, is the width \u0393 the total decay width, which is related to the proper lifetime. Because the width is given as \u0393, so the relation is \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4, where \u03c4 is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). But in the lab frame, the lifetime observed is longer by gamma, so the mean decay length would be v * gamma tau.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I messed that up. Let me think again.\n\nThe width \u0393 is related to the proper lifetime \u03c4_0: \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4_0.\n\nBut when the particle is moving with velocity v, its lifetime in the lab frame is dilated: \u03c4 = gamma * tau_0.\n\nSo the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma, so the decay distance is v * gamma tau_0.\n\nWait, no. Because tau_0 is the proper lifetime, and in the lab frame, tau = gamma tau_0.\n\nSo the decay length L = v * tau = v gamma tau_0.\n\nBut tau_0 is \u0127/(Gamma), so:\n\nL = v gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in considering whether tau is the proper time or not. Let me clarify.\n\nThe width \u0393 is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime in the rest frame. So \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4_0. So the mean lifetime in the rest frame is \u03c4_0 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nWhen the particle is moving, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0.\n\nSo the decay length is v * tau = v gamma tau_0 = v gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nBut earlier, I didn't include the gamma factor. Oh! So that's where I went wrong. I only calculated v * tau_0, but I should have multiplied by gamma.\n\nSo I need to calculate gamma, the Lorentz factor.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).\n\nBeta is 0.98875. So beta squared is about (0.98875)^2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.98875^2 = (1 - 0.01125)^2 \u2248 1 - 2 * 0.01125 + (0.01125)^2 \u2248 0.97771875.\n\nSo 1 - beta^2 \u2248 1 - 0.97771875 = 0.02228125.\n\nsqrt(0.02228125) \u2248 0.14927.\n\nSo gamma = 1 / 0.14927 \u2248 6.69.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately.\n\nCompute beta = 0.98875.\n\nbeta^2 = (0.98875)^2 = let's compute it as (0.98 + 0.00875)^2.\n\n0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n0.00875^2 \u2248 0.00007656.\n\nCross terms: 2*0.98 *0.00875= 0.01715.\n\nSo total beta^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01715 + 0.00007656 \u2248 0.97762656.\n\nSo 1 - beta^2 = 1 - 0.97762656 = 0.02237344.\n\nsqrt(0.02237344) \u2248 0.149578.\n\nSo gamma is 1 / 0.149578 \u2248 6.685.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 6.685.\n\nSo now, L = v gamma tau_0.\n\nBut v is beta c, and tau_0 is \u0127/(Gamma).\n\nSo L = beta c * gamma * (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nbeta = 0.98875,\n\ngamma \u22486.685,\n\n\u0127 =6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s,\n\nGamma =0.32 GeV,\n\nc =3e8 m/s.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.98875 * 6.685 * (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV) * 3e8 m/s.\n\nWait, let me break that down.\n\nFirst, compute the terms step by step.\n\nCompute gamma * beta:\n\ngamma * beta = 6.685 * 0.98875 \u2248 approx 6.685 * 0.98875.\n\nLet me compute that: 6.685 *0.98 =6.5513, 6.685*0.00875= approx 0.05848. So total is about 6.6098.\n\nSo gamma beta \u22486.61.\n\nNow, (gamma beta) * (\u0127 / Gamma) = 6.61 * (6.582e-25 /0.32).\n\nCompute 6.582e-25 /0.32 = approx 20.56875e-25.\n\nSo 6.61 * 20.56875e-25 \u2248 136.2e-25 = 1.362e-23.\n\nMultiply by c (3e8 m/s):\n\n1.362e-23 *3e8 = 4.086e-15 meters.\n\nWait, that's 4.086e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me recompute that precisely.\n\nWait, let me redo the calculation step by step.\n\ngamma =6.685.\n\nbeta=0.98875.\n\ngamma * beta =6.685 * 0.98875.\n\nCompute 6 *0.98875=5.9325.\n\n0.685 *0.98875: 0.6 *0.98875=0.59325, 0.08 *0.98875=0.0791, 0.005 *0.98875=0.00494375.

So sqrt is approximately 0.1495 +0.816*(0.0001) =0.1495816.\n\nSo sqrt(0.0223734375)\u22480.1495816.\n\nSo gamma=1/0.1495816\u22486.6855.\n\nHmm, more accurately, 1/0.1495816 is approximately 6.6855.\n\nSo gamma=6.6855.\n\nNow, recalculating gamma * beta: 6.6855 *0.98875.\n\nCompute 6.6855 *0.98875.\n\n=6.6855*(1 -0.01125) =6.6855 -6.6855*0.01125.\n\nCompute 6.6855 *0.01125: 0.07534875.\n\nSo gamma * beta=6.6855 -0.07534875=6.61015125.\n\nSo now, (gamma beta) =6.61015125.\n\nNow, (gamma beta) * (\u0127 / Gamma) =6.61015125 * (6.582e-25 /0.32).\n\nCompute 6.582e-25 /0.32=20.56875e-25.\n\nSo 6.61015125 *20.56875e-25= ?\n\nCompute 6 *20.56875e-25=123.4125e-25.\n\n0.61015125 *20.56875e-25.\n\nCompute 0.6 *20.56875e-25=12.34125e-25.\n\n0.01015125 *20.56875e-25\u22480.2085e-25.\n\nSo sum:123.4125e-25 +12.34125e-25 +0.2085e-25 =135.96225e-25 =1.3596225e-23.\n\nMultiply by c (3e8 m/s):\n\n1.3596225e-23 *3e8 =4.0788675e-15 m.\n\nHmm, that's approximately 4.0789e-15 m.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m.\n\nHmm, 4.0789e-15 is close to 4.0655e-15, but not exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere, perhaps in the value of \u0127.\n\nWait, let me double-check the value of \u0127. I used 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, but perhaps it's more precise. Let me look up the exact value.\n\nThe exact value of \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s is approximately 6.582 \u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is due to the approximation of gamma. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation expects us to use the relativistic expression for lifetime without considering gamma, which would give a different result.\n\nWait, earlier I didn't include gamma and got 6.1e-16, but the options don't have that. Then when including gamma, I got 4.07e-15, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15). Maybe with more precise calculations, it aligns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the correct formula. Let me think about it again.\n\nWait, another approach: the mean path L is given by L = (c * tau) * beta gamma.\n\nBecause tau is the proper lifetime, the observed lifetime is tau_obs = tau * gamma.\n\nSo, L = v * tau_obs = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nBut tau is the proper lifetime, which is \u0127/(Gamma).\n\nSo,\n\nL = beta c gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation should use natural units and then convert to meters.\n\nWait, another approach: using natural units where c=1, \u0127=1.\n\nIn natural units, the decay length is L = beta gamma tau.\n\nBut tau is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nWait, in natural units, \u0127=1, so tau =1/Gamma.\n\nWait, but units can be tricky. Alternatively, let's compute everything in natural units and then convert to meters.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute everything in terms of GeV and inverse GeV, then convert to meters.\n\nLet me try this.\n\nIn natural units (c=1, \u0127=1), the mean lifetime tau is 1/Gamma.\n\nSo tau =1/(0.32 GeV).\n\nBut to convert tau from inverse GeV to seconds: since 1 GeV = 1.60218e-10 J, and \u0127=6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, so 1 GeV^{-1} = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) * (1 GeV^{-1}) ) =6.582e-25 s.\n\nWait, because 1 GeV^{-1} = (\u0127 c )/(1 GeV) * (1/(c^2)) ), but perhaps it's easier to think that in natural units, 1 GeV^{-1} corresponds to 6.582e-25 s.\n\nSo tau =1/(0.32 GeV) = (1/0.32) *6.582e-25 s \u224820.56875e-25 s=2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, same as before.\n\nNow, the observed lifetime in the lab frame is tau_lab = gamma tau.\n\nSo L = beta c tau_lab = beta c gamma tau.\n\nWhich again brings us back to the same formula.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate everything accurately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial approach of not considering the gamma factor was wrong, and the correct formula includes gamma.\n\nWait, let's think about the decay width and lifetime. The decay width \u0393 is related to the mean lifetime \u03c4 (proper time) as \u0393 = \u0127/\u03c4. So \u03c4 = \u0127/\u0393.\n\nIn the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, so the mean decay length is L = v * gamma tau = beta c gamma tau.\n\nSo, with tau = \u0127/(Gamma), we have L = beta c gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nSo, substituting the numbers:\n\nbeta =0.98875,\n\ngamma \u22486.685,\n\n\u0127=6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s,\n\nGamma=0.32 GeV,\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\nSo,\n\nL =0.98875 * 6.685 * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) *3e8.\n\nCompute each part:\n\nCompute 0.98875 *6.685 = approx 6.6098.\n\nCompute 6.582e-25 /0.32=20.56875e-25.\n\nMultiply 6.6098 *20.56875e-25 =136.2e-25=1.362e-23.\n\nMultiply by 3e8 m/s: 1.362e-23 *3e8 =4.086e-15 m.\n\nHmm, same result as before.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nHmm, perhaps the precise calculation with more accurate gamma would yield exactly option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nCompute gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).\n\nbeta =0.98875.\n\nbeta^2 = (0.98875)^2 =0.9776265625.\n\nSo 1 - beta^2=0.0223734375.\n\nsqrt(0.0223734375) = sqrt(223734375e-11) ?\n\nAlternatively, compute sqrt(0.0223734375) precisely.\n\nLet me compute it as follows:\n\nWe can write 0.0223734375 =223734375e-11.\n\nBut perhaps using a calculator approach.\n\nWe know that 0.1495^2=0.02235025.\n\nWait, 0.1495^2= (0.149)^2 + 2*0.149*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.\n\nWait, 0.149^2=0.022201.\n\n2*0.149 *0.0005=0.000149.\n\n(0.0005)^2=0.00000025.\n\nSo 0.022201 +0.000149 =0.02235 +0.00000025=0.02235025.\n\nSo 0.1495^2=0.02235025.\n\nOur target is 0.0223734375, which is larger.\n\nThe difference between target and 0.02235025 is 0.0000231875.\n\nWe can use linear approximation.\n\nLet x =0.1495,\n\nf(x) =x^2=0.02235025.\n\nWe need f(x + delta) =0.0223734375.\n\ndelta \u2248 (0.0223734375 -0.02235025)/(2x) )= (0.0000231875)/(2 *0.1495)= 0.0000231875/(0.299)\u22480.0000775.\n\nSo x + delta \u22480.1495 +0.0000775=0.1495775.\n\nSo sqrt(0.0223734375)\u22480.1495775.\n\nThus, gamma=1/0.1495775\u22486.6855.\n\nSo gamma=6.6855.\n\nNow, beta * gamma =0.98875 *6.6855.\n\nCompute 0.98875 *6.6855.\n\nLet me compute 6.6855 *0.98875.\n\n=6.6855*(1 - 0.01125) =6.6855 - (6.6855 *0.01125).\n\nCompute 6.6855 *0.01125:\n\n6.6855 *0.01 =0.066855.\n\n6.6855 *0.00125=0.008356875.\n\nSo total is 0.066855 +0.008356875=0.075211875.\n\nSo 6.6855 -0.075211875=6.610288125.\n\nSo beta gamma=6.610288125.\n\nNow, compute beta gamma * (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\n=6.610288125 * (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s /0.32 GeV )\n\n=6.610288125 * (20.56875e-25 s)\n\n=6.610288125 *20.56875e-25 = 136.2e-25=1.362e-23 s.\n\nMultiply by c=3e8 m/s:\n\n1.362e-23 s *3e8 m/s=4.086e-15 m.\n\nHmm, same result as before.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option B:4.0655e-15 m.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact calculation would give 4.0655e-15 m. Maybe I'm missing something in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the formula.\n\nWait, another approach: calculate the velocity using E and m, then find gamma, then compute L.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that I'm using GeV and not converting correctly. Let me re-express the decay width in the correct units.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for decay length is L = (c * \u0127) / (Gamma * m) ) * beta gamma.\n\nWait, no, perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of the formula for the decay length: L = (c * tau) * beta gamma.\n\nWhich is what I've been using.\n\nBut let me see if I can find a formula that might lead to the options given.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation expects the use of the natural unit conversion where c=3e8 m/s and \u0127=6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, let me compute everything in terms of GeV and then convert.\n\nCompute L = beta gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma ) * c.\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.\n\nBut perhaps the calculation should be:\n\nL = (beta gamma) * ( \u0127 c ) / Gamma.\n\nBecause c is in m/s, and \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, let's compute ( \u0127 c ) =6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s =1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m.\n\nBecause 6.582e-25 *3e8= (6.582 *3) *1e-17 =19.746e-17 =1.9746e-16.\n\nSo,\n\nL = (beta gamma) * (1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m ) / (Gamma GeV )\n\n= (beta gamma) * (1.9746e-16 m ) / (Gamma )\n\nGamma is in GeV, so units cancel.\n\nSo,\n\nL= (beta gamma) * (1.9746e-16 m ) / 0.32 GeV.\n\nWait, no, because (1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m ) / (0.32 GeV ) = (1.9746e-16 /0.32 ) m \u22486.1706e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by beta gamma=6.610288.\n\nSo,\n\nL\u22486.610288 *6.1706e-16 m \u22484.086e-15 m.\n\nSame result again.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the correct answer is option B:4.0655e-15 m.\n\nWait, but why is my calculation giving 4.086e-15 and the option is 4.0655e-15?\n\nAh, perhaps the exact calculation with precise gamma and beta would give that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(1 - beta^2) with more precision.\n\nBeta=0.98875.\n\nBeta squared=0.9776265625.\n\n1 - beta^2=0.0223734375.\n\nCompute sqrt(0.0223734375).\n\nLet me use more precise method.\n\nWe can use the Newton-Raphson method to compute sqrt(0.0223734375).\n\nLet x0=0.1495.\n\nx0^2=0.02235025.\n\nf(x)=x^2 -0.0223734375=0.\n\nf'(x)=2x.\n\nCompute f(x0)=0.02235025 -0.0223734375= -0.0000231875.\n\nNext approximation: x1 =x0 - f(x0)/(2x0) )=0.1495 - (-0.0000231875)/(2*0.1495).\n\n=0.1495 + 0.0000231875/(0.299).\n\nCompute 0.0000231875 /0.299 \u22487.7525e-5.\n\nSo x1=0.1495 +0.000077525=0.149577525.\n\nCompute x1^2= (0.149577525)^2.\n\n=0.149577525 *0.149577525.\n\nCompute:\n\n0.1495 *0.1495 =0.02235025.\n\nNow, 0.149577525 =0.1495 +0.000077525.\n\nSo (a +b)^2 =a^2 + 2ab +b^2.\n\na=0.1495, b=0.000077525.\n\na^2=0.02235025.\n\n2ab=2 *0.1495 *0.000077525 \u22480.00002319.\n\nb^2\u2248(0.000077525)^2\u22486.01e-9.\n\nSo total x1^2=0.02235025 +0.00002319 +6.01e-9 \u22480.02237344.\n\nWhich is very close to our target 0.0223734375.\n\nSo sqrt(0.0223734375)=x1\u22480.149577525.\n\nSo gamma=1/x1\u22481/0.149577525\u22486.68555.\n\nSo gamma=6.68555.\n\nNow, beta gamma=0.98875 *6.68555.\n\nCompute 0.98875 *6.68555.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n0.98875 *6=5.9325.\n\n0.98875 *0.68555= ?\n\nCompute 0.98875 *0.6=0.59325.\n\n0.98875 *0.08=0.0791.\n\n0.98875 *0.00555= approx 0.005489.\n\nAdding these: 0.59325 +0.0791=0.67235 +0.005489=0.677839.\n\nSo total beta gamma=5.9325 +0.677839=6.610339.\n\nNow, compute L= beta gamma * ( \u0127 c ) / Gamma.\n\n( \u0127 c )=6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s *3e8 m/s =1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m.\n\nGamma=0.32 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL=6.610339 * (1.9746e-16 m ) /0.32.\n\nCompute 1.9746e-16 /0.32=6.170625e-16.\n\nMultiply by 6.610339: 6.610339 *6.170625e-16 \u22484.086e-15 m.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nBut the option is 4.0655e-15, which is a bit lower.

No, 6.1e-16 is not an option.

So if beta^2=0.9775, then 1-beta^2=0.0225, whose square root is 0.15.\n\nSo gamma=1/0.15=6.6666667.\n\nWait, wait a second. That's a different approach. Let me see.\n\nEarlier, I computed beta as sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 )).\n\nWhich is correct. So beta= sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2 )) = sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.9887.\n\nBut wait, 0.9775 is 0.9775.\n\nWait, 0.9887^2=0.9775?\n\nWait, 0.9887*0.9887= let's compute:\n\n0.98 *0.98=0.9604.\n\n0.0087 *0.98=0.008526.\n\n0.98 *0.0087=0.008526.\n\n0.0087^2=0.00007569.\n\nSo adding up: 0.9604 + 0.008526 +0.008526 +0.00007569 =0.9604 + 0.017052 +0.00007569=0.97752769.\n\nWhich is very close to 0.9775.\n\nSo beta=0.9887.\n\nWait, but 0.9887^2=0.97752769, which is 0.97752769, not 0.9775.\n\nSo 1 - beta^2=1 -0.97752769=0.02247231.\n\nSo sqrt(0.02247231)= approx 0.1499.\n\nSo gamma=1/0.1499\u22486.669.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 1 - beta^2 was 0.0225, leading to gamma=6.6667.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake earlier in computing 1 - beta^2.\n\nWait, E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.\n\nSo E\u00b2=64 GeV\u00b2, m\u00b2=1.44 GeV\u00b2.\n\nSo (m c^2 )\u00b2= (1.2 GeV )^2 =1.44 GeV\u00b2.\n\nSo (pc )\u00b2=E\u00b2 - (m c^2 )^2 =64 -1.44=62.56 GeV\u00b2.\n\nSo pc= sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.\n\nSo beta= (pc )/ E =7.91/8=0.98875.\n\nSo beta=0.98875.\n\nWait, but earlier I computed beta as sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2 ))=sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887, which is the same as 7.91/8=0.98875.\n\nWait, so beta is 0.98875.\n\nSo beta^2= (0.98875)^2=0.9776265625.\n\nSo 1 - beta^2=0.0223734375.\n\nSo sqrt(0.0223734375)=0.1495775.\n\nSo gamma=1/0.1495775\u22486.6855.\n\nSo earlier calculations were correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is option B:4.0655e-15 m.\n\nBut my calculation gives 4.086e-15 m.\n\nBut perhaps the correct answer is option B, so I'll go with that.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the relativistic relation for the decay length:\n\n\\[\nL = \\beta \\gamma \\tau\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\beta = v/c \\) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light,\n- \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} \\) is the Lorentz factor,\n- \\( \\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} \\) is the proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( \\beta \\)\nThe energy \\( E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) and mass \\( m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2 \\) are given.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through.\n\nThe question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X as 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nWait, I remember that the decay length of a particle is related to its lifetime and velocity. The formula I think is something like L = v * \u03c4, where \u03c4 is the proper lifetime. But wait, what's the proper lifetime? Oh right, that's the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But since the particle is moving at high speeds, we'll have to consider time dilation when calculating the mean lifetime observed in the lab frame.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the lifetime \u03c4? I think the width \u0393 is related to the lifetime. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The natural linewidth is \u0393, and the mean lifetime \u03c4 is given by \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, wait, units. Let me make sure. \u0393 is the total decay width, and \u03c4 is the mean lifetime. So \u03c4 is inversely proportional to \u0393.\n\nSo first, let me convert all the units into something manageable. Let's see, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV, and \u0393 is 320 MeV. Oh, wait, I need to make sure all are in the same units. Let's convert everything to GeV for consistency. \u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. The production energy is 8 GeV. I thought that for a resonance, the energy is around its mass. But the mass is 1.2 GeV, so why is the production energy higher? Maybe because it's produced via some high-energy collision, but that's probably not directly relevant here.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the velocity of the meson. To find the velocity, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass m is 1.2 GeV. So, the energy E is the total energy, which is gamma (\u03b3) times m c\u00b2. But since we're working in natural units where c=1, E = \u03b3 m. So \u03b3 is E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So \u03b3 is approximately 6.6667.\n\nNow, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta squared), where beta is v/c. So, solving for beta:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2)\nsqrt(1 - beta\u00b2) = 1/gamma\n1 - beta\u00b2 = 1/(gamma\u00b2)\nbeta\u00b2 = 1 - 1/(gamma\u00b2)\ngamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is about (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u2248 44.444. So 1/(gamma\u00b2) is 9/400 = 0.0225. So beta squared is 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root, beta \u2248 sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So beta is roughly 0.9887, which is about 0.99c.\n\nSo the velocity is about 0.9887c.\n\nNext, I need to find the lifetime \u03c4. As I said earlier, \u03c4 is \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, the units are in GeV and MeV. Let's get all the constants right.\n\nThe reduced Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, \u0393 is given in GeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) \u00d7 1e-25 s \u2248 20.56875 \u00d7 1e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. 6.582 divided by 0.32. 0.32 goes into 6.582 about 20.56875 times, right? So yeah, that's 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nBut wait, no, because 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Yep.\n\nNow, but that's the proper lifetime \u03c4. The lab frame lifetime is longer due to time dilation. The lab frame lifetime \u03c4_lab is \u03b3 * \u03c4. Because \u03c4_lab = \u03b3 * \u03c4_rest.\n\nSo \u03c4_lab = gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = ?\n\nLet me calculate 2 * 6.6667 is about 13.3334, but 2.056875 is 2 + 0.056875. 0.056875 *6.6667 is approx 0.3792. So total is 13.3334 + 0.3792 = 13.7126e-24 s.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 2.056875e-24 * 6.6667:\n\nLet me do it more accurately. 2.056875 * 6.6667 \u2248 let's compute 2 *6.6667 is 13.3334, 0.056875 *6.6667 is approx 0.3792. So total is 13.7126. So 13.7126e-24 s.\n\nSo \u03c4_lab \u2248 1.37126e-23 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. 2.056875 * 6.6667:\n\n2.056875 * 6 = 12.34125\n\n2.056875 * 0.6667 \u2248 1.37125.\n\nSo total is 12.34125 + 1.37125 = 13.7125. So yes, 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused. Because 2.056875e-24 multiplied by 6.6667 is (2.056875 * 6.6667) )e-24.\n\nSo 2.056875 * 6.6667 \u2248 13.7126, so 13.7126e-24 s = 1.37126e-23 s.\n\nNow, the decay length L is v * \u03c4_lab.\n\nv is beta * c. Beta is approx 0.9887, so v = 0.9887 * c. Let's take c as approximately 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo, L = v * \u03c4_lab = (0.9887 * 3e8 m/s) * (1.37126e-23 s).\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.9661e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply that by 1.37126e-23 s.\n\nSo 2.9661e8 * 1.37126e-23 = let's compute the exponents first: 1e8 *1e-23 = 1e-15.\n\nSo 2.9661 *1.37126 \u2248 let's calculate that.\n\n2.9661 * 1 = 2.9661\n2.9661 * 0.3 = 0.88983\n2.9661 *0.07 = 0.207627\n2.9661 *0.00126 = approx 0.003748\nAdding up: 2.9661 + 0.88983 = 3.85593; +0.207627=4.063557; +0.003748=4.067305.\n\nSo approximately 4.0673, multiplied by 1e-15 m. So L \u2248 4.0673e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, and option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, my calculation is about 4.067e-15, which is very close to option B, 4.0655e-15.\n\nWait, but why is my calculation getting about 4.067e-15, and option B is 4.0655e-15. That's very close. Maybe I made a minor approximation in the beta value.\n\nWait, let me double-check the beta calculation. Gamma was 8 /1.2 = 6.666... So gamma = 20/3.\n\nSo gamma squared is (400/9) = approx 44.4444.\n\nSo beta squared is 1 - (1/(gamma squared)) = 1 - (9/400) = (400 -9)/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.\n\nLet me think, sqrt(0.9775) is sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = approx 1 - (0.0225)/(2*1) = 0.98875, but that's a rough approximation. Alternatively, using a calculator approach.\n\nLet me compute 0.9775:\n\nWhat's 0.9887 squared? 0.9887^2 = (approx) (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2.\n\n0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2*0.98*0.0087 = 0.0172.\n\n0.0087^2 \u2248 0.00007569.\n\nSo total is 0.9604 + 0.0172 = 0.9776 + 0.00007569 = 0.97767569.\n\nWait, but beta squared is 0.9775, so 0.9887^2 is 0.97767569, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So beta is a bit less than 0.9887.\n\nLet me find a better approximation. Let me set x = beta, so x^2 = 0.9775.\n\nWe can write x = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887, but perhaps a little less.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute sqrt(0.9775):\n\nWe can use the Newton-Raphson method. Let's approximate.\n\nLet me make an initial guess. Let me take x0 = 0.9887.\n\nCompute x0^2 = 0.97767569.\n\nWe need x where x\u00b2 = 0.9775.\n\nCompute the difference: 0.97767569 - 0.9775 = 0.00017569.\n\nSo, f(x) = x\u00b2 - 0.9775 = 0.\n\nf(x0) = 0.97767569 -0.9775=0.00017569.\n\nf'(x0)=2x0= 2*0.9887=1.9774.\n\nWe want to find delta x such that f(x0 + delta x) \u2248 f(x0) + f'(x0) delta x =0.\n\nSo 0.00017569 + 1.9774 * delta x \u2248 0 \u2192 delta x \u2248 -0.00017569 / 1.9774 \u2248 -0.0000888.\n\nSo x \u2248 x0 + delta x = 0.9887 - 0.0000888 \u2248 0.988611.\n\nSo beta \u2248 0.988611.\n\nSo more accurately, beta is about 0.988611.\n\nSo, v = beta c \u2248 0.988611 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9658e8 m/s.\n\nNow, let me recalculate L = v * \u03c4_lab.\n\nEarlier, I had \u03c4_lab \u2248 1.37126e-23 s.\n\nv is 2.9658e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = (2.9658e8 m/s) * (1.37126e-23 s) = 2.9658e8 *1.37126e-23 = 2.9658 *1.37126 *1e-15.\n\nCalculating 2.9658 *1.37126:\n\nLet me compute 2.9658 * 1.37126.\n\nHmm, 2.9658 * 1 = 2.9658.\n\n2.9658 * 0.3 = 0.88974.\n\n2.9658 * 0.07 = 0.207606.\n\n2.9658 * 0.00126 \u2248 0.003742.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n2.9658 + 0.88974 = 3.85554.\n\n3.85554 + 0.207606 = 4.063146.\n\n4.063146 + 0.003742 \u2248 4.066888.\n\nSo approximately 4.0669e-15 meters.\n\nWait, but option B is 4.0655e-15, and option C is 5.0223e-15. Hmm, our calculation is about 4.0669e-15, which is very close to option B.\n\nBut wait, why is there a discrepancy? Because perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma and beta.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculation of gamma.\n\nE = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.\n\ngamma = E / m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... which is correct.\n\nGamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 = approx 44.4444.\n\nSo beta squared is 1 - (9/400) = 391/400 = 0.9775, correct.\n\nSo beta is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.988611.\n\nSo v = 0.988611 c \u2248 2.9658e8 m/s.\n\nTau_rest is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV s.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau_rest = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nTau_lab is gamma * tau_rest = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nSo L = v * tau_lab = (2.9658e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s) = (2.9658 *1.37125) *1e-15 m.\n\nCompute 2.9658 *1.37125.\n\nLet me compute more accurately:\n\n1.37125 = 1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.00125.\n\n2.9658 * 1 = 2.9658.\n\n2.9658 * 0.3 = 0.88974.\n\n2.9658 * 0.07 = 0.207606.\n\n2.9658 * 0.00125 = 0.00370725.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n2.9658 + 0.88974 = 3.85554.\n\n3.85554 + 0.207606 = 4.063146.\n\n4.063146 + 0.00370725 = 4.066853.\n\nSo approximately 4.06685e-15 m.\n\nHmm, the options are B) 4.0655e-15 m and C) 5.0223e-15 m.\n\nOur calculation is about 4.06685e-15, which is very close to option B, but a little higher. But perhaps due to more precise calculations, it might be a bit lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the constants. Let's check.\n\nWait, the Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Let me use more precise value: \u0127 = 6.582 \u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau_rest = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nGamma is 8 /1.2 = 6.666666... So tau_lab = 6.666666... * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute that exactly.\n\n6.666666... is 20/3, so 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875 ) /3 * 1e-24.\n\n20 * 2.056875 = 41.1375.\n\n41.1375 / 3 = 13.7125.\n\nSo tau_lab = 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nv is 0.988611 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96583e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = v * tau_lab = (2.96583e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s) = (2.96583 * 1.37125) \u00d7 1e-15 m.\n\nCalculating 2.96583 *1.37125.\n\nLet me compute 2.96583 *1.37125.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1.37125 = 1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.00125.\n\n2.96583 *1 = 2.96583.\n\n2.96583 *0.3 = 0.889749.\n\n2.96583 *0.07 = 0.2076081.\n\n2.96583 *0.00125 = 0.0037072875.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n2.96583 + 0.889749 = 3.855579.\n\n3.855579 + 0.2076081 = 4.0631871.\n\n4.0631871 + 0.0037072875 = 4.0668944.\n\nSo, approximately 4.0668944e-15 m.\n\nWait, but option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So our calculation is about 4.0669e-15, which is 4.0669e-15, so that's about 4.067e-15.\n\nBut the option B is 4.0655e-15, which is slightly smaller. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise beta.\n\nWait, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nGamma is 20/3, so gamma^2 is 400/9.\n\nSo 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) = let's compute this more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a calculator, but since I don't have one, I can use a better approximation.\n\nAnother approach: Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) using a Taylor expansion around x=1.\n\nLet me set x=1, and delta x = -0.0225.\n\nSo sqrt(x + delta x) \u2248 sqrt(x) + (delta x)/(2 sqrt(x)) - (delta x)^2/(8 x^(3/2)) + ... \n\nSo sqrt(1 -0.0225) \u2248 1 + (-0.0225)/(2*1) - ( (-0.0225)^2 )/(8*1) + ... \n\n= 1 - 0.01125 - (0.00050625)/8 + ... \n\n= 1 - 0.01125 - 0.00006328125.\n\n= 1 - 0.01131328125.\n\n= 0.98868671875.\n\nWait, but earlier using Newton-Raphson, I got beta as approximately 0.988611, but this method gives 0.9886867.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me compute which is more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.\n\nCompute sqrt(0.9775):\n\nLet me think of 0.9886^2: 0.9886 * 0.9886.\n\nCompute 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.\n\n0.98 * 0.0086 = 0.008428.\n\n0.0086 * 0.98 = 0.008428.\n\n0.0086 * 0.0086 = 0.00007396.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute 0.9886^2:\n\n(0.98 + 0.0086)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0086 + 0.0086^2.\n\n0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2*0.98*0.0086 = 0.017152.\n\n0.0086^2 = 0.00007396.\n\nSum: 0.9604 + 0.017152 = 0.977552 + 0.00007396 = 0.97762596.\n\nBut we need 0.9775. So 0.9886^2 is 0.97762596, which is higher than 0.9775.\n\nSo we need a beta a bit less than 0.9886.\n\nLet me compute 0.9885^2.\n\n0.9885^2: (0.988 + 0.0005)^2.\n\n= 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 + 0.0005^2.\n\n0.988^2 = (0.98 + 0.008)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144.\n\nThen, 2*0.988 * 0.0005 = 0.000988.\n\n0.0005^2 = 0.00000025.\n\nSo total 0.976144 +0.000988 = 0.977132 + 0.00000025= 0.97713225.\n\nWait, but we're looking for 0.9775. So 0.9885^2 is 0.97713225, which is lower than 0.9775.\n\nSo between 0.9885 and 0.9886, the square crosses 0.9775.\n\nAt 0.9885: 0.97713225.\n\nAt 0.9886: 0.97762596.\n\nWe need the value x where x^2=0.9775.\n\nThe difference between 0.9775 and 0.97713225 is 0.00036775.\n\nThe range between 0.9885 and 0.9886 is 0.0001 in x, which leads to an increase of 0.97762596 - 0.97713225 = 0.00049371 in x\u00b2.\n\nWe need an increase of 0.00036775 from 0.97713225.\n\nSo the fraction is 0.00036775 / 0.00049371 \u2248 0.745.\n\nSo x \u2248 0.9885 + 0.745 * 0.0001 = 0.9885 + 0.0000745 = 0.9885745.\n\nSo beta \u2248 0.9885745.\n\nSo v = beta c \u2248 0.9885745 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9657235e8 m/s.\n\nNow, recalculate L:\n\nL = v * tau_lab = (2.9657235e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s) = (2.9657235 * 1.37125) * 1e-15 m.\n\nCompute 2.9657235 * 1.37125.\n\nLet me compute this accurately:\n\n2.9657235 *1.37125.\n\nBreakdown:\n\n1.37125 = 1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.00125.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n2.9657235 * 1 = 2.9657235.\n\n2.9657235 * 0.3 = 0.88971705.\n\n2.9657235 *0.07 = 0.207600645.\n\n2.9657235 *0.00125 = 0.003707154375.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n2.9657235 + 0.88971705 = 3.85544055.\n\n3.85544055 + 0.207600645 = 4.063041195.\n\n4.063041195 + 0.003707154375 = 4.06674835.\n\nSo L \u2248 4.06674835e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.0667e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The slight difference might be due to more precise values of the constants or more accurate beta.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the tau_lab.\n\nWait, let's check the tau_rest calculation again. Tau_rest is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nWait, the width is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau_rest = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24.\n\n20/3 is approximately 6.6666667.\n\n20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) /3 * 1e-24.\n\n20 * 2.056875 = 41.1375.\n\n41.1375 /3 = 13.7125.\n\nSo, tau_lab = 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the option B is the correct one, given the approximated calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the decay length formula more precisely.\n\nWait, another approach: decay length L = (c * tau_lab) * beta.\n\nBecause L = v * tau_lab = beta c * tau_lab.\n\nSo L = beta c tau_lab.\n\nBut tau_lab = gamma tau_rest.\n\nSo L = beta c gamma tau_rest.\n\nAnd tau_rest is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo,\n\nL = beta c gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\nbeta \u2248 0.9885745.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\ngamma = 20/3 \u22486.6666667.\n\n\u0127 =6.582e-25 GeV s.\n\nGamma = 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9885745 * 3e8 m/s * (20/3) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV).\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nThe 3 in numerator and denominator cancel out.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9885745 * (20) * (6.582e-25) * (3e8) / 0.32.\n\nCompute each part:\n\nFirst, 20 * 6.582e-25 = 131.64e-25 = 1.3164e-23.\n\nMultiply by 3e8: 1.3164e-23 * 3e8 = 3.9492e-15.\n\nMultiply by 0.9885745: 3.9492e-15 * 0.9885745 \u2248 3.9492 *0.9885745 \u2248 approx 3.906e-15.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute step by step.\n\nCompute L = (0.9885745) * (3e8) * (20/3) * (6.582e-25) / (0.32).\n\nThe (3e8) * (20/3) is (3e8)*(20/3)= 20e8.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9885745 * 20e8 * 6.582e-25 / 0.32.\n\nCompute 20e8 *6.582e-25 = 20 *6.582e-17 = 131.64e-17 = 1.3164e-15.\n\nMultiply by 0.9885745: 1.3164e-15 *0.9885745 \u2248 1.304e-15.\n\nThen divide by 0.32: 1.304e-15 / 0.32 \u22484.075e-15.\n\nWait, that's 4.075e-15 meters, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15) and option C is 5.02e-15.\n\nBut this approach gives around 4.075e-15, which is a bit higher than option B. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.\n\nLet me recalculate L:\n\nL = (beta c) * (gamma tau_rest).\n\ngamma tau_rest = gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nSo,\n\nL = beta c (gamma \u0127) / Gamma.\n\nCompute each part:\n\nbeta = 0.9885745.\n\nc =3e8 m/s.\n\ngamma =20/3.\n\n\u0127=6.582e-25 GeV s.\n\nGamma=0.32 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9885745 * 3e8 * (20/3) * 6.582e-25 / 0.32.\n\nThe 3 in numerator and denominator cancel.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9885745 * 20 * 6.582e-25 *3e8 / 0.32.\n\nCompute 20 *6.582e-25 = 131.64e-25 =1.3164e-23.\n\nMultiply by 3e8: 1.3164e-23 *3e8 = 3.9492e-15.\n\nMultiply by 0.9885745: 3.9492e-15 * 0.9885745 \u22483.906e-15.\n\nDivide by 0.32: 3.906e-15 / 0.32 \u224812.206e-15 m.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier calculations gave about 4e-15, but this gives 12e-15. That's a problem. I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recompute.\n\nWait, 20 *6.582e-25 =131.64e-25=1.3164e-23.\n\nMultiply by 3e8: 1.3164e-23 *3e8 = (1.3164 *3) *1e-23 *1e8 =3.9492 *1e-15=3.9492e-15.\n\nMultiply by beta (0.9885745): 3.9492e-15 *0.9885745 \u22483.906e-15.\n\nDivide by Gamma (0.32):\n\n3.906e-15 / 0.32 = 12.206e-15? That's 1.2206e-14 meters. That's way too big, which can't be correct because the options are around 1e-15.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the formula is L = beta c gamma tau_rest.\n\nBut tau_rest is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo,\n\nL = beta c gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nSo substituting the numbers:\n\nbeta=0.9885745,\n\nc=3e8 m/s,\n\ngamma=20/3,\n\n\u0127=6.582e-25 GeV s,\n\nGamma=0.32 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9885745 * 3e8 * (20/3) * (6.582e-25) / 0.32.\n\nThe 3 in numerator and denominator cancels.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9885745 * 20 * 6.582e-25 *3e8 / 0.32.\n\nNow, compute each step:\n\nCompute 20 *6.582e-25 = 131.64e-25 =1.3164e-23.\n\nMultiply by 3e8: 1.3164e-23 *3e8 =3.9492e-15.\n\nMultiply by 0.9885745: 3.9492e-15 *0.9885745\u22483.906e-15.\n\nDivide by 0.32: 3.906e-15 /0.32=12.206e-15 m=1.2206e-14 m.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier calculations with a different approach gave about 4e-15 m. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a unit conversion somewhere. Because \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s, and c is in m/s, so units need to be compatible.\n\nWait, perhaps I should convert \u0127 to units that make the calculation correct.\n\nWait, let me think about the units.\n\nEnergy in GeV, time in seconds.\n\nc is in m/s.\n\nSo, beta is unitless, gamma is unitless.\n\nSo, tau_rest is in seconds.\n\nSo, the calculation should work out.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm messing up the exponents.\n\nWait, let me compute each multiplication step carefully.\n\nCompute 0.9885745 * 20 =19.77149.\n\nMultiply by 6.582e-25: 19.77149 *6.582e-25 \u2248 (19.77149 *6.582) *1e-25.\n\n19.77149 *6.582 \u2248 let me compute:\n\n20 *6.582=131.64. Subtract 0.22851*6.582.\n\n0.22851 *6.582 \u2248 1.506.\n\nSo 131.64 -1.506=130.134.\n\nSo 19.77149 *6.582e-25 \u2248130.134e-25=1.30134e-23.\n\nMultiply by 3e8: 1.30134e-23 *3e8=3.90402e-15.\n\nDivide by 0.32:3.90402e-15 /0.32=12.2000625e-15 m=1.22000625e-14 m.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before, which is way larger than the options. This can't be correct. There must be a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that the units for \u0127 are in GeV\u00b7s, which is correct, but when multiplying by c (m/s), the units should cancel correctly.\n\nWait, let me recompute the entire formula with units in mind.\n\nL has units of meters.\n\nbeta is unitless.\n\nc is m/s.\n\ngamma is unitless.\n\ntau_rest is seconds.\n\nGamma is in GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL = beta * c * gamma * (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nCompute each part:\n\nbeta =0.9885745.\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\ngamma=20/3.\n\n\u0127=6.582e-25 GeV s.\n\nGamma=0.32 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nbeta * c = 0.9885745 *3e8 m/s \u22482.9657235e8 m/s.\n\ngamma * (\u0127 / Gamma) = (20/3) * (6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV) = (20/3) * (6.582e-25 /0.32) s.\n\nCompute 6.582e-25 /0.32 =2.056875e-24 s.\n\nMultiply by (20/3): 2.056875e-24 *20/3 = (20 *2.056875e-24)/3 =41.1375e-24 /3 =13.7125e-24 s=1.37125e-23 s.\n\nSo, gamma * (\u0127 / Gamma) = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nNow, L = (beta c) * (gamma tau_rest) = (2.9657235e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s) = 2.9657235e8 *1.37125e-23 m.\n\nMultiply 2.9657235e8 by 1.37125e-23:\n\n= (2.9657235 *1.37125) * 1e8 *1e-23 = (4.0667) * 1e-15 m =4.0667e-15 m.\n\nAh, okay, that makes sense. So the correct calculation gives L\u22484.0667e-15 m, which is very close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through.\n\nThe question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X as 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nWait, I remember that the decay length of a particle is related to its lifetime and velocity. The formula I think is something like L = v * \u03c4, where \u03c4 is the proper lifetime. But wait, what's the proper lifetime? Oh right, that's the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But since the particle is moving at high speeds, we'll have to consider time dilation when calculating the mean lifetime observed in the lab frame.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the lifetime \u03c4? I think the width \u0393 is related to the lifetime. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The natural linewidth is \u0393, and the mean lifetime \u03c4 is given by \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, wait, units. Let me make sure. \u0393 is the total decay width, and \u03c4 is the mean lifetime. So \u03c4 is inversely proportional to \u0393.\n\nSo first, let me convert all the units into something manageable. Let's see, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV, and \u0393 is 320 MeV. Oh, wait, I need to make sure all are in the same units. Let's convert everything to GeV for consistency. \u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. The production energy is 8 GeV. I thought that for a resonance, the energy is around its mass. But the mass is 1.2 GeV, so why is the production energy higher? Maybe because it's produced via some high-energy collision, but that's probably not directly relevant here.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the velocity of the meson. To find the velocity, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass m is 1.2 GeV. So, the energy E is the total energy, which is gamma (\u03b3) times m c\u00b2. But since we're working in natural units where c=1, E = \u03b3 m. So \u03b3 is E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So \u03b3 is approximately 6.6667.\n\nNow, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta squared), where beta is v/c. So, solving for beta:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2)\nsqrt(1 - beta\u00b2) = 1/gamma\n1 - beta\u00b2 = 1/(gamma\u00b2)\nbeta\u00b2 = 1 - 1/(gamma\u00b2)\ngamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is about (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u2248 44.444. So 1/(gamma\u00b2) is 9/400 = 0.0225. So beta squared is 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root, beta \u2248 sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So beta is roughly 0.9887, which is about 0.99c.\n\nSo the velocity is about 0.9887c.\n\nNext, I need to find the lifetime \u03c4. As I said earlier, \u03c4 is \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, the units are in GeV and MeV. Let's get all the constants right.\n\nThe reduced Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, \u0393 is given in GeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) \u00d7 1e-25 s \u2248 20.56875 \u00d7 1e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. 6.582 divided by 0.32. 0.32 goes into 6.582 about 20.56875 times, right? So yeah, that's 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nBut wait, no, because 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Yep.\n\nNow, but that's the proper lifetime \u03c4. The lab frame lifetime is longer due to time dilation. The lab frame lifetime \u03c4_lab is \u03b3 * \u03c4. Because \u03c4_lab = \u03b3 * \u03c4_rest.\n\nSo \u03c4_lab = gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = ?\n\nLet me calculate 2 * 6.6667 is about 13.3334, but 2.056875 is 2 + 0.056875. 0.056875 *6.6667 is approx 0.3792. So total is 13.3334 + 0.3792 = 13.7126e-24 s.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 2.056875e-24 * 6.6667:\n\nLet me do it more accurately. 2.056875 * 6.6667 \u2248 let's compute 2 *6.6667 is 13.3334, 0.056875 *6.6667 is approx 0.3792. So total is 13.7126. So 13.7126e-24 s.\n\nSo \u03c4_lab \u2248 1.37126e-23 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. 2.056875 * 6.6667:\n\n2.056875 * 6 = 12.34125\n\n2.056875 * 0.6667 \u2248 1.37125.\n\nSo total is 12.34125 + 1.37125 = 13.7125. So yes, 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused. Because 2.056875e-24 multiplied by 6.6667 is (2.056875 * 6.6667) )e-24.\n\nSo 2.056875 * 6.6667 \u2248 13.7126, so 13.7126e-24 s = 1.37126e-23 s.\n\nNow, the decay length L is v * \u03c4_lab.\n\nv is beta * c. Beta is approx 0.9887, so v = 0.9887 * c. Let's take c as approximately 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo, L = v * \u03c4_lab = (0.9887 * 3e8 m/s) * (1.37126e-23 s).\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.9661e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply that by 1.37126e-23 s.\n\nSo 2.9661e8 * 1.37126e-23 = let's compute the exponents first: 1e8 *1e-23 = 1e-15.\n\nSo 2.9661 *1.37126 \u2248 let's calculate that.\n\n2.9661 * 1 = 2.9661\n2.9661 * 0.3 = 0.88983\n2.9661 *0.07 = 0.207627\n2.9661 *0.00126 = approx 0.003748\nAdding up: 2.9661 + 0.88983 = 3.85593; +0.207627=4.063557; +0.003748=4.067305.\n\nSo approximately 4.0673, multiplied by 1e-15 m. So L \u2248 4.0673e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, and option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, my calculation is about 4.067e-15, which is very close to option B, 4.0655e-15.\n\nWait, but why is my calculation getting about 4.067e-15, and option B is 4.0655e-15. That's very close. Maybe I made a minor approximation in the beta value.\n\nWait, let me double-check the beta calculation. Gamma was 8 /1.2 = 6.666... So gamma = 20/3.\n\nSo gamma squared is (400/9) = approx 44.4444.\n\nSo beta squared is 1 - (1/(gamma squared)) = 1 - (9/400) = (400 -9)/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.\n\nLet me think, sqrt(0.9775) is sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = approx 1 - (0.0225)/(2*1) = 0.98875, but that's a rough approximation. Alternatively, using a calculator approach.\n\nLet me compute 0.9775:\n\nWhat's 0.9887 squared? 0.9887^2 = (approx) (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2.\n\n0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2*0.98*0.0087 = 0.0172.\n\n0.0087^2 \u2248 0.00007569.\n\nSo total is 0.9604 + 0.0172 = 0.9776 + 0.00007569 = 0.97767569.\n\nWait, but beta squared is 0.9775, so 0.9887^2 is 0.97767569, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So beta is a bit less than 0.9887.\n\nLet me find a better approximation. Let me set x = beta, so x^2 = 0.9775.\n\nWe can write x = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887, but perhaps a little less.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute sqrt(0.9775):\n\nWe can use the Newton-Raphson method. Let's approximate.\n\nLet me make an initial guess. Let me take x0 = 0.9887.\n\nCompute x0^2 = 0.97767569.\n\nWe need x where x\u00b2 = 0.9775.\n\nCompute the difference: 0.97767569 - 0.9775 = 0.00017569.\n\nSo, f(x) = x\u00b2 - 0.9775 = 0.\n\nf(x0) = 0.97767569 -0.9775=0.00017569.\n\nf'(x0)=2x0= 2*0.9887=1.9774.\n\nWe want to find delta x such that f(x0 + delta x) \u2248 f(x0) + f'(x0) delta x =0.\n\nSo 0.00017569 + 1.9774 * delta x \u2248 0 \u2192 delta x \u2248 -0.00017569 / 1.9774 \u2248 -0.0000888.\n\nSo x \u2248 x0 + delta x = 0.9887 - 0.0000888 \u2248 0.988611.\n\nSo beta \u2248 0.988611.\n\nSo more accurately, beta is about 0.988611.\n\nSo, v = beta c \u2248 0.988611 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9658e8 m/s.\n\nNow, let me recalculate L = v * \u03c4_lab.\n\nEarlier, I had \u03c4_lab \u2248 1.37126e-23 s.\n\nv is 2.9658e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = (2.9658e8 m/s) * (1.37126e-23 s) = 2.9658e8 *1.37126e-23 = 2.9658 *1.37126 *1e-15.\n\nCalculating 2.9658 *1.37126:\n\nLet me compute 2.9658 * 1.37126.\n\nHmm, 2.9658 * 1 = 2.9658.\n\n2.9658 * 0.3 = 0.88974.\n\n2.9658 * 0.07 = 0.207606.\n\n2.9658 * 0.00126 \u2248 0.003742.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n2.9658 + 0.88974 = 3.85554.\n\n3.85554 + 0.207606 = 4.063146.\n\n4.063146 + 0.003742 \u2248 4.066888.\n\nSo approximately 4.0669e-15 meters.\n\nWait, but option B is 4.0655e-15, and option C is 5.0223e-15. Hmm, our calculation is about 4.0669e-15, which is very close to option B.\n\nBut wait, why is there a discrepancy? Because perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma and beta.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculation of gamma.\n\nE = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.\n\ngamma = E / m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... which is correct.\n\nGamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 = approx 44.4444.\n\nSo beta squared is 1 - (9/400) = 391/400 = 0.9775, correct.\n\nSo beta is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.988611.\n\nSo v = 0.988611 c \u2248 2.9658e8 m/s.\n\nTau_rest is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV s.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau_rest = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nTau_lab is gamma * tau_rest = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nSo L = v * tau_lab = (2.9658e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s) = (2.9658 *1.37125) *1e-15 m.\n\nCompute 2.9658 *1.37125.\n\nLet me compute more accurately:\n\n1.37125 = 1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.00125.\n\n2.9658 * 1 = 2.9658.\n\n2.9658 * 0.3 = 0.88974.\n\n2.9658 * 0.07 = 0.207606.\n\n2.9658 * 0.00125 = 0.00370725.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n2.9658 + 0.88974 = 3.85554.\n\n3.85554 + 0.207606 = 4.063146.\n\n4.063146 + 0.00370725 = 4.066853.\n\nSo approximately 4.06685e-15 m.\n\nHmm, the options are B) 4.0655e-15 m and C) 5.0223e-15 m.\n\nOur calculation is about 4.06685e-15, which is very close to option B, but a little higher. But perhaps due to more precise calculations, it might be a bit lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the constants. Let's check.\n\nWait, the Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Let me use more precise value: \u0127 = 6.582 \u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau_rest = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nGamma is 8 /1.2 = 6.666666... So tau_lab = 6.666666... * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute that exactly.\n\n6.666666... is 20/3, so 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875 ) /3 * 1e-24.\n\n20 * 2.056875 = 41.1375.\n\n41.1375 / 3 = 13.7125.\n\nSo tau_lab = 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nv is 0.988611 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96583e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = v * tau_lab = (2.96583e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s) = (2.96583 * 1.37125) \u00d7 1e-15 m.\n\nCalculating 2.96583 *1.37125.\n\nLet me compute 2.96583 *1.37125.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1.37125 = 1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.00125.\n\n2.96583 *1 = 2.96583.\n\n2.96583 *0.3 = 0.889749.\n\n2.96583 *0.07 = 0.2076081.\n\n2.96583 *0.00125 = 0.0037072875.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n2.96583 + 0.889749 = 3.855579.\n\n3.855579 + 0.2076081 = 4.0631871.\n\n4.0631871 + 0.0037072875 = 4.0668944.\n\nSo, approximately 4.0668944e-15 m.\n\nWait, but option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So our calculation is about 4.0669e-15, which is 4.0669e-15, so that's about 4.067e-15.\n\nBut the option B is 4.0655e-15, which is slightly smaller. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise beta.\n\nWait, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nGamma is 20/3, so gamma^2 is 400/9.\n\nSo 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) = let's compute this more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a calculator, but since I don't have one, I can use a better approximation.\n\nAnother approach: Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) using a Taylor expansion around x=1.\n\nLet me set x=1, and delta x = -0.0225.\n\nSo sqrt(x + delta x) \u2248 sqrt(x) + (delta x)/(2 sqrt(x)) - (delta x)^2/(8 x^(3/2)) + ... \n\nSo sqrt(1 -0.0225) \u2248 1 + (-0.0225)/(2*1) - ( (-0.0225)^2 )/(8*1) + ... \n\n= 1 - 0.01125 - (0.00050625)/8 + ... \n\n= 1 - 0.01125 - 0.00006328125.\n\n= 1 - 0.01131328125.\n\n= 0.98868671875.\n\nWait, but earlier using Newton-Raphson, I got beta as approximately 0.988611, but this method gives 0.9886867.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me compute which is more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.\n\nCompute sqrt(0.9775):\n\nLet me think of 0.9886^2: 0.9886 * 0.9886.\n\nCompute 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.\n\n0.98 * 0.0086 = 0.008428.\n\n0.0086 * 0.98 = 0.008428.\n\n0.0086 * 0.0086 = 0.00007396.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute 0.9886^2:\n\n(0.98 + 0.0086)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0086 + 0.0086^2.\n\n0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2*0.98*0.0086 = 0.017152.\n\n0.0086^2 = 0.00007396.\n\nSum: 0.9604 + 0.017152 = 0.977552 + 0.00007396 = 0.97762596.\n\nBut we need 0.9775. So 0.9886^2 is 0.97762596, which is higher than 0.9775.\n\nSo we need a beta a bit less than 0.9886.\n\nLet me compute 0.9885^2.\n\n0.9885^2: (0.988 + 0.0005)^2.\n\n= 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 + 0.0005^2.\n\n0.988^2 = (0.98 + 0.008)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144.\n\nThen, 2*0.988 * 0.0005 = 0.000988.\n\n0.0005^2 = 0.00000025.\n\nSo total 0.976144 +0.000988 = 0.977132 + 0.00000025= 0.97713225.\n\nWait, but we're looking for 0.9775. So 0.9885^2 is 0.97713225, which is lower than 0.9775.\n\nSo between 0.9885 and 0.9886, the square crosses 0.9775.\n\nAt 0.9885: 0.97713225.\n\nAt 0.9886: 0.97762596.\n\nWe need the value x where x^2=0.9775.\n\nThe difference between 0.9775 and 0.97713225 is 0.00036775.\n\nThe range between 0.9885 and 0.9886 is 0.0001 in x, which leads to an increase of 0.97762596 - 0.97713225 = 0.00049371 in x\u00b2.\n\nWe need an increase of 0.00036775 from 0.97713225.\n\nSo the fraction is 0.00036775 / 0.00049371 \u2248 0.745.\n\nSo x \u2248 0.9885 + 0.745 * 0.0001 = 0.9885 + 0.0000745 = 0.9885745.\n\nSo beta \u2248 0.9885745.\n\nSo v = beta c \u2248 0.9885745 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9657235e8 m/s.\n\nNow, recalculate L:\n\nL = v * tau_lab = (2.9657235e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s) = (2.9657235 * 1.37125) * 1e-15 m.\n\nCompute 2.9657235 * 1.37125.\n\nLet me compute this accurately:\n\n2.9657235 *1.37125.\n\nBreakdown:\n\n1.37125 = 1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.00125.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n2.9657235 * 1 = 2.9657235.\n\n2.9657235 * 0.3 = 0.88971705.\n\n2.9657235 *0.07 = 0.207600645.\n\n2.9657235 *0.00125 = 0.003707154375.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n2.9657235 + 0.88971705 = 3.85544055.\n\n3.85544055 + 0.207600645 = 4.063041195.\n\n4.063041195 + 0.003707154375 = 4.06674835.\n\nSo L \u2248 4.06674835e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.0667e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The slight difference might be due to more precise values of the constants or more accurate beta.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the tau_lab.\n\nWait, let's check the tau_rest calculation again. Tau_rest is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nWait, the width is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau_rest = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24.\n\n20/3 is approximately 6.6666667.\n\n20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) /3 * 1e-24.\n\n20 * 2.056875 = 41.1375.\n\n41.1375 /3 = 13.7125.\n\nSo, tau_lab = 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the option B is the correct one, given the approximated calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the decay length formula more precisely.\n\nWait, another approach: decay length L = (c * tau_lab) * beta.\n\nBecause L = v * tau_lab = beta c * tau_lab.\n\nSo L = beta c tau_lab.\n\nBut tau_lab = gamma tau_rest.\n\nSo L = beta c gamma tau_rest.\n\nAnd tau_rest is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo,\n\nL = beta c gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\nbeta \u2248 0.9885745.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\ngamma = 20/3 \u22486.6666667.\n\n\u0127 =6.582e-25 GeV s.\n\nGamma = 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9885745 * 3e8 m/s * (20/3) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV).\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nThe 3 in numerator and denominator cancel out.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9885745 * (20) * (6.582e-25) * (3e8) / 0.32.\n\nCompute each part:\n\nFirst, 20 * 6.582e-25 = 131.64e-25 = 1.3164e-23.\n\nMultiply by 3e8: 1.3164e-23 * 3e8 = 3.9492e-15.\n\nMultiply by 0.9885745: 3.9492e-15 * 0.9885745 \u2248 3.9492 *0.9885745 \u2248 approx 3.906e-15.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute step by step.\n\nCompute L = (0.9885745) * (3e8) * (20/3) * (6.582e-25) / (0.32).\n\nThe (3e8) * (20/3) is (3e8)*(20/3)= 20e8.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9885745 * 20e8 * 6.582e-25 / 0.32.\n\nCompute 20e8 *6.582e-25 = 20 *6.582e-17 = 131.64e-17 = 1.3164e-15.\n\nMultiply by 0.9885745: 1.3164e-15 *0.9885745 \u2248 1.304e-15.\n\nThen divide by 0.32: 1.304e-15 / 0.32 \u22484.075e-15.\n\nWait, that's 4.075e-15 meters, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15) and option C is 5.02e-15.\n\nBut this approach gives around 4.075e-15, which is a bit higher than option B. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.\n\nLet me recalculate L:\n\nL = (beta c) * (gamma tau_rest).\n\ngamma tau_rest = gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nSo,\n\nL = beta c (gamma \u0127) / Gamma.\n\nCompute each part:\n\nbeta = 0.9885745.\n\nc =3e8 m/s.\n\ngamma =20/3.\n\n\u0127=6.582e-25 GeV s.\n\nGamma=0.32 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9885745 * 3e8 * (20/3) * 6.582e-25 / 0.32.\n\nThe 3 in numerator and denominator cancel.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9885745 * 20 * 6.582e-25 *3e8 / 0.32.\n\nCompute 20 *6.582e-25 = 131.64e-25 =1.3164e-23.\n\nMultiply by 3e8: 1.3164e-23 *3e8 = 3.9492e-15.\n\nMultiply by 0.9885745: 3.9492e-15 * 0.9885745 \u22483.906e-15.\n\nDivide by 0.32: 3.906e-15 / 0.32 \u224812.206e-15 m.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier calculations gave about 4e-15, but this gives 12e-15. That's a problem. I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recompute.\n\nWait, 20 *6.582e-25 =131.64e-25=1.3164e-23.\n\nMultiply by 3e8: 1.3164e-23 *3e8 = (1.3164 *3) *1e-23 *1e8 =3.9492 *1e-15=3.9492e-15.\n\nMultiply by beta (0.9885745): 3.9492e-15 *0.9885745 \u22483.906e-15.\n\nDivide by Gamma (0.32):\n\n3.906e-15 / 0.32 = 12.206e-15? That's 1.2206e-14 meters. That's way too big, which can't be correct because the options are around 1e-15.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the formula is L = beta c gamma tau_rest.\n\nBut tau_rest is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo,\n\nL = beta c gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nSo substituting the numbers:\n\nbeta=0.9885745,\n\nc=3e8 m/s,\n\ngamma=20/3,\n\n\u0127=6.582e-25 GeV s,\n\nGamma=0.32 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9885745 * 3e8 * (20/3) * (6.582e-25) / 0.32.\n\nThe 3 in numerator and denominator cancels.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9885745 * 20 * 6.582e-25 *3e8 / 0.32.\n\nNow, compute each step:\n\nCompute 20 *6.582e-25 = 131.64e-25 =1.3164e-23.\n\nMultiply by 3e8: 1.3164e-23 *3e8 =3.9492e-15.\n\nMultiply by 0.9885745: 3.9492e-15 *0.9885745\u22483.906e-15.\n\nDivide by 0.32: 3.906e-15 /0.32=12.206e-15 m=1.2206e-14 m.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier calculations with a different approach gave about 4e-15 m. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a unit conversion somewhere. Because \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s, and c is in m/s, so units need to be compatible.\n\nWait, perhaps I should convert \u0127 to units that make the calculation correct.\n\nWait, let me think about the units.\n\nEnergy in GeV, time in seconds.\n\nc is in m/s.\n\nSo, beta is unitless, gamma is unitless.\n\nSo, tau_rest is in seconds.\n\nSo, the calculation should work out.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm messing up the exponents.\n\nWait, let me compute each multiplication step carefully.\n\nCompute 0.9885745 * 20 =19.77149.\n\nMultiply by 6.582e-25: 19.77149 *6.582e-25 \u2248 (19.77149 *6.582) *1e-25.\n\n19.77149 *6.582 \u2248 let me compute:\n\n20 *6.582=131.64. Subtract 0.22851*6.582.\n\n0.22851 *6.582 \u2248 1.506.\n\nSo 131.64 -1.506=130.134.\n\nSo 19.77149 *6.582e-25 \u2248130.134e-25=1.30134e-23.\n\nMultiply by 3e8: 1.30134e-23 *3e8=3.90402e-15.\n\nDivide by 0.32:3.90402e-15 /0.32=12.2000625e-15 m=1.22000625e-14 m.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before, which is way larger than the options. This can't be correct. There must be a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that the units for \u0127 are in GeV\u00b7s, which is correct, but when multiplying by c (m/s), the units should cancel correctly.\n\nWait, let me recompute the entire formula with units in mind.\n\nL has units of meters.\n\nbeta is unitless.\n\nc is m/s.\n\ngamma is unitless.\n\ntau_rest is seconds.\n\nGamma is in GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL = beta * c * gamma * (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nCompute each part:\n\nbeta =0.9885745.\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\ngamma=20/3.\n\n\u0127=6.582e-25 GeV s.\n\nGamma=0.32 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nbeta * c = 0.9885745 *3e8 m/s \u22482.9657235e8 m/s.\n\ngamma * (\u0127 / Gamma) = (20/3) * (6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV) = (20/3) * (6.582e-25 /0.32) s.\n\nCompute 6.582e-25 /0.32 =2.056875e-24 s.\n\nMultiply by (20/3): 2.056875e-24 *20/3 = (20 *2.056875e-24)/3 =41.1375e-24 /3 =13.7125e-24 s=1.37125e-23 s.\n\nSo, gamma * (\u0127 / Gamma) = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nNow, L = (beta c) * (gamma tau_rest) = (2.9657235e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s) = 2.9657235e8 *1.37125e-23 m.\n\nMultiply 2.9657235e8 by 1.37125e-23:\n\n= (2.9657235 *1.37125) * 1e8 *1e-23 = (4.0667) * 1e-15 m =4.0667e-15 m.\n\nAh, okay, that makes sense. So the correct calculation gives L\u22484.0667e-15 m, which is very close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the formula for the decay length:\n\n\\[\nL = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the velocity of the particle and \\( \\tau_{\\text{lab}} \\) is the lifetime in the lab frame.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some numbers in meters.\n\nWait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. Because the decay distance is how far the particle travels before decaying, which depends on its speed and lifetime. Oh right, the formula for mean decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime gamma factor multiplied by the lifetime. Or wait, more accurately, the mean proper lifetime is \u03c4, and the lifetime observed is gamma \u03c4. Then the speed is beta c, so the distance would be beta gamma c tau.\n\nBut wait, first I need to find the lifetime of the meson. The lifetime is related to the width. The width \u0393 is the total decay width, which is connected to the mean lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The relation is \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nWait, but I have to be careful with units here. Let me think about the units. \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 is in units of GeV\u00b7s or something? Or maybe I should convert everything into compatible units.\n\nSo, the Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Because \u0127 = h/(2\u03c0), and h is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. But when dealing with GeV, we need to convert everything into appropriate units.\n\nSo, \u0393 is given as 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV: 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. So \u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. Plugging in the numbers: \u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 2.056875e-24? Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = approximately 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yes.\n\nNext, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So, the energy is much larger than the mass, so it's probably ultra-relativistic. But let's do it properly.\n\nThe relativistic energy is E = gamma m c\u00b2. Wait, but in units where c=1, E = gamma m. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) but since we're using GeV and GeV/c\u00b2 for mass, the c's are accounted for. So gamma = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 6.6667. Then, the velocity beta is v/c, and beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2)). Wait, no, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Let me compute that.\n\nWait, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))). So gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.6667. So gamma squared is (6.6667)^2 \u2248 44.4444. So 1/(gamma^2) is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to use beta = (p c^2)/(E), where p is momentum. Because E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So, p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) GeV. Wait, but units-wise, perhaps I should think in terms of GeV. So p c is in GeV.\n\nWait, E = 8 GeV, m c\u00b2 = 1.2 GeV. So E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c^4 \u2192 p c = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV = sqrt(62.56) GeV \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo, p c = 7.91 GeV.\n\nBut p is gamma m v. So, p = gamma m v. So, p c = gamma m v c.\n\nWait, let me think again. p c = gamma m v c\u00b2. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, since beta = v/c, then beta = (p c)/(E). Because E = gamma m c\u00b2, and p = gamma m v. So, p c = gamma m v c\u00b2 = gamma m c\u00b2 (v/c) = E beta.\n\nSo beta = (p c)/(E). Since p c is sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4), but we've already calculated p c as sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 0.98875. So that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo beta is approximately 0.98875 c.\n\nNow, the lifetime is tau, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau. Because of time dilation. So the mean lifetime is gamma tau. So the mean distance is speed multiplied by lifetime.\n\nSo distance L = beta c gamma tau.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The mean decay distance is c multiplied by the lifetime gamma tau, multiplied by beta. Because the particle is moving at speed beta c, and it lives for gamma tau time, so distance is beta c * gamma tau.\n\nWait, but the lifetime is tau, so the observed lifetime is gamma tau. So the distance is v * t = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nYes, so L = beta c gamma tau.\n\nWe have all the parts now.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nBeta is 0.98875.\n\nGamma is 6.66667.\n\nSo, let's compute L.\n\nFirst, compute beta gamma: 0.98875 * 6.66667 \u2248 6.591666.\n\nThen multiply by c: c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.\n\nSo, L = 6.591666 * 3e8 m/s * tau.\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase: L = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nSo, putting numbers in:\n\nbeta * gamma = 0.98875 * 6.66667 \u2248 6.591666.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\ntau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo, L = 6.591666 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 6.591666 * 3e8 = 1.9775e9.\n\nThen, multiply by 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the units are (m/s) * s, so the seconds cancel.\n\nWait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, beta is dimensionless, gamma is dimensionless, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is in seconds.\n\nSo L = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nSo:\n\nbeta * gamma = 6.591666.\n\nc * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nWait, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen multiply by beta gamma (6.591666):\n\n6.591666 * 6.170625e-16 m \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute 6.591666 * 6.170625e-16.\n\n6 * 6 is 36, so 6.59 * 6.17 is approximately:\n\n6 * 6 =36, 6 *0.17=1.02; 0.59 *6=3.54; 0.59 *0.17\u22480.10.\n\nAdding up: 36 +1.02 +3.54 +0.10 \u2248 40.66.\n\nWait, but 6.591666 * 6.170625 = ?\n\nLet me compute it more accurately.\n\n6.591666 * 6.170625:\n\nWell, 6 *6 =36, 6*0.170625=1.02375; 0.591666 *6=3.55; 0.591666 *0.170625\u22480.10086.\n\nSo 36 +1.02375 +3.55 +0.10086 \u2248 40.6746.\n\nWait, that's 40.6746, but that's 6.591666 *6.170625 \u2248 40.6746.\n\nBut wait, no, wait. 6.591666 *6.170625 is:\n\nLet me compute 6.591666 *6.170625.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n6.591666 * 6 = 39.55\n\n6.591666 * 0.170625 = approx 1.125.\n\nSo total approx 40.675.\n\nSo 40.675e-16 meters.\n\nWait, wait, no, because 6.591666 *6.170625e-16 is 40.675e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but 40.675e-16 meters is 4.0675e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.0223e-15.\n\nWait, my calculation gives about 4.0675e-15 m, which is close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nBut wait, let's be more precise in the calculations.\n\nLet me compute beta gamma more accurately.\n\nBeta is 7.91 GeV /8 GeV = 0.98875.\n\nGamma is 8/1.2=6.6666666667.\n\nSo beta gamma = 0.98875 *6.6666666667.\n\nLet me compute 0.98875 *6.6666666667.\n\n0.98875 *6 = 5.9325.\n\n0.98875 *0.6666666667 \u2248 0.6591666667.\n\nSo total beta gamma = 5.9325 + 0.6591666667 \u2248 6.5916666667.\n\nSo beta gamma is exactly 6.5916666667.\n\nNow, c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 *2.056875e-24.\n\n3e8 is 3 *1e8.\n\n2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 *1e-24.\n\nMultiply: 3*2.056875 = 6.170625.\n\nExponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.\n\nSo c * tau = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nThen, L = beta gamma * (c tau) = 6.5916666667 *6.170625e-16.\n\nMultiply 6.5916666667 *6.170625.\n\nLet me compute this more accurately.\n\n6.5916666667 *6.170625:\n\n= (6 + 0.5916666667) * (6 + 0.170625)\n= 6*6 +6*0.170625 +0.5916666667 *6 + 0.5916666667 *0.170625\n=36 + 1.02375 + 3.55 + 0.1008625\nAdding them up:\n\n36 +1.02375 =37.02375\n\n37.02375 +3.55=40.57375\n\n40.57375 +0.1008625 \u224840.6746125.\n\nSo 40.6746125e-16 meters.\n\nWhich is 4.06746125e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nOption C is 5.0223e-15 m.\n\nSo my calculation is approximately 4.0675e-15, which is very close to option B.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should check the calculation for tau again.\n\nTau = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\n\u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me make sure about the formula. Because sometimes the width is given as the total decay width, and the lifetime is tau=\u0127/(Gamma), right. So that part is correct.\n\nSo, the mean decay length is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is option B: 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nBut wait, the options are A:5.0223e-16, B:4.0655e-15, C:5.0223e-15, D:4.0655e-16.\n\nSo, my calculation is 4.067e-15, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some numbers in meters.\n\nWait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. Because the decay distance is how far the particle travels before decaying, which depends on its speed and lifetime. Oh right, the formula for mean decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime gamma factor multiplied by the lifetime. Or wait, more accurately, the mean proper lifetime is \u03c4, and the lifetime observed is gamma \u03c4. Then the speed is beta c, so the distance would be beta gamma c tau.\n\nBut wait, first I need to find the lifetime of the meson. The lifetime is related to the width. The width \u0393 is the total decay width, which is connected to the mean lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The relation is \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nWait, but I have to be careful with units here. Let me think about the units. \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 is in units of GeV\u00b7s or something? Or maybe I should convert everything into compatible units.\n\nSo, the Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Because \u0127 = h/(2\u03c0), and h is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. But when dealing with GeV, we need to convert everything into appropriate units.\n\nSo, \u0393 is given as 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV: 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. So \u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. Plugging in the numbers: \u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 2.056875e-24? Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = approximately 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yes.\n\nNext, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So, the energy is much larger than the mass, so it's probably ultra-relativistic. But let's do it properly.\n\nThe relativistic energy is E = gamma m c\u00b2. Wait, but in units where c=1, E = gamma m. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) but since we're using GeV and GeV/c\u00b2 for mass, the c's are accounted for. So gamma = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 6.6667. Then, the velocity beta is v/c, and beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2)). Wait, no, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Let me compute that.\n\nWait, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))). So gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.6667. So gamma squared is (6.6667)^2 \u2248 44.4444. So 1/(gamma^2) is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to use beta = (p c^2)/(E), where p is momentum. Because E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So, p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) GeV. Wait, but units-wise, perhaps I should think in terms of GeV. So p c is in GeV.\n\nWait, E = 8 GeV, m c\u00b2 = 1.2 GeV. So E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c^4 \u2192 p c = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV = sqrt(62.56) GeV \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo, p c = 7.91 GeV.\n\nBut p is gamma m v. So, p = gamma m v. So, p c = gamma m v c.\n\nWait, let me think again. p c = gamma m v c\u00b2. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, since beta = v/c, then beta = (p c)/(E). Because E = gamma m c\u00b2, and p = gamma m v. So, p c = gamma m v c\u00b2 = gamma m c\u00b2 (v/c) = E beta.\n\nSo beta = (p c)/(E). Since p c is sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4), but we've already calculated p c as sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 0.98875. So that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo beta is approximately 0.98875 c.\n\nNow, the lifetime is tau, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau. Because of time dilation. So the mean lifetime is gamma tau. So the mean distance is speed multiplied by lifetime.\n\nSo distance L = beta c gamma tau.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The mean decay distance is c multiplied by the lifetime gamma tau, multiplied by beta. Because the particle is moving at speed beta c, and it lives for gamma tau time, so distance is beta c * gamma tau.\n\nWait, but the lifetime is tau, so the observed lifetime is gamma tau. So the distance is v * t = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nYes, so L = beta c gamma tau.\n\nWe have all the parts now.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nBeta is 0.98875.\n\nGamma is 6.66667.\n\nSo, let's compute L.\n\nFirst, compute beta gamma: 0.98875 * 6.66667 \u2248 6.591666.\n\nThen multiply by c: c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.\n\nSo, L = 6.591666 * 3e8 m/s * tau.\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase: L = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nSo, putting numbers in:\n\nbeta * gamma = 0.98875 * 6.66667 \u2248 6.591666.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\ntau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo, L = 6.591666 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 6.591666 * 3e8 = 1.9775e9.\n\nThen, multiply by 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the units are (m/s) * s, so the seconds cancel.\n\nWait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, beta is dimensionless, gamma is dimensionless, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is in seconds.\n\nSo L = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nSo:\n\nbeta * gamma = 6.591666.\n\nc * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nWait, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen multiply by beta gamma (6.591666):\n\n6.591666 * 6.170625e-16 m \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute 6.591666 * 6.170625e-16.\n\n6 * 6 is 36, so 6.59 * 6.17 is approximately:\n\n6 * 6 =36, 6 *0.17=1.02; 0.59 *6=3.54; 0.59 *0.17\u22480.10.\n\nAdding up: 36 +1.02 +3.54 +0.10 \u2248 40.66.\n\nWait, but 6.591666 * 6.170625 = ?\n\nLet me compute it more accurately.\n\n6.591666 * 6.170625:\n\nWell, 6 *6 =36, 6*0.170625=1.02375; 0.591666 *6=3.55; 0.591666 *0.170625\u22480.10086.\n\nSo 36 +1.02375 +3.55 +0.10086 \u2248 40.6746.\n\nWait, that's 40.6746, but that's 6.591666 *6.170625 \u2248 40.6746.\n\nBut wait, no, wait. 6.591666 *6.170625 is:\n\nLet me compute 6.591666 *6.170625.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n6.591666 * 6 = 39.55\n\n6.591666 * 0.170625 = approx 1.125.\n\nSo total approx 40.675.\n\nSo 40.675e-16 meters.\n\nWait, wait, no, because 6.591666 *6.170625e-16 is 40.675e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but 40.675e-16 meters is 4.0675e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.0223e-15.\n\nWait, my calculation gives about 4.0675e-15 m, which is close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nBut wait, let's be more precise in the calculations.\n\nLet me compute beta gamma more accurately.\n\nBeta is 7.91 GeV /8 GeV = 0.98875.\n\nGamma is 8/1.2=6.6666666667.\n\nSo beta gamma = 0.98875 *6.6666666667.\n\nLet me compute 0.98875 *6.6666666667.\n\n0.98875 *6 = 5.9325.\n\n0.98875 *0.6666666667 \u2248 0.6591666667.\n\nSo total beta gamma = 5.9325 + 0.6591666667 \u2248 6.5916666667.\n\nSo beta gamma is exactly 6.5916666667.\n\nNow, c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 *2.056875e-24.\n\n3e8 is 3 *1e8.\n\n2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 *1e-24.\n\nMultiply: 3*2.056875 = 6.170625.\n\nExponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.\n\nSo c * tau = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nThen, L = beta gamma * (c tau) = 6.5916666667 *6.170625e-16.\n\nMultiply 6.5916666667 *6.170625.\n\nLet me compute this more accurately.\n\n6.5916666667 *6.170625:\n\n= (6 + 0.5916666667) * (6 + 0.170625)\n= 6*6 +6*0.170625 +0.5916666667 *6 + 0.5916666667 *0.170625\n=36 + 1.02375 + 3.55 + 0.1008625\nAdding them up:\n\n36 +1.02375 =37.02375\n\n37.02375 +3.55=40.57375\n\n40.57375 +0.1008625 \u224840.6746125.\n\nSo 40.6746125e-16 meters.\n\nWhich is 4.06746125e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nOption C is 5.0223e-15 m.\n\nSo my calculation is approximately 4.0675e-15, which is very close to option B.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should check the calculation for tau again.\n\nTau = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\n\u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me make sure about the formula. Because sometimes the width is given as the total decay width, and the lifetime is tau=\u0127/(Gamma), right. So that part is correct.\n\nSo, the mean decay length is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is option B: 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nBut wait, the options are A:5.0223e-16, B:4.0655e-15, C:5.0223e-15, D:4.0655e-16.\n\nSo, my calculation is 4.067e-15, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we start by calculating its proper lifetime \\( \\tau \\), which is related to the total decay width \\( \\Gamma \\) by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( \\hbar = 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s} \\) and \\( \\Gamma = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \\approx 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\), which is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) and \\( m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think it through.\n\nThe question says X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. \n\nWait, mean decay distance. I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its decay width. The formula, I think, is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393, where \u0393 is the total decay width. But wait, the decay distance would be the mean lifetime multiplied by the particle's velocity, right? Because distance is velocity times time. So, d = v * \u03c4.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check the formula. The mean lifetime \u03c4 is indeed \u0127 divided by the total decay width \u0393. Since \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. Okay, so first I need to calculate \u03c4, then multiply by v to get the decay length.\n\nBut wait, particles like mesons, their velocity depends on their mass and energy. Since the production energy E is given, which is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much higher than the rest mass. So the particle is moving relativistically, meaning v is approximately c. So maybe I can approximate v as the speed of light, c = 3e8 m/s. That would simplify the calculation.\n\nWait, but to be precise, maybe I should compute the velocity using the relativistic energy formula. The total energy E is gamma * m c\u00b2. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). But since m is in GeV/c\u00b2, and E is also in GeV, maybe it's easier to calculate gamma as E/(m) since units would work out in natural units where c=1.\n\nWait, natural units: in particle physics, c=1 and \u0127=1 in appropriate units. But when converting to meters, I have to use actual constants.\n\nWait, let's get the units straight. The mass m_X is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2, E_X is 8 GeV. So the gamma factor is E/(m c\u00b2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 /1.2 \u22486.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.\n\nSo gamma is 6.6667, so the velocity v is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) * c. Let's compute that.\n\nGamma squared is (6.6667)^2 \u224844.444. So 1/gamma\u00b2 is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887 * c. So about 0.9887 times 3e8 m/s. That's roughly 2.966e8 m/s. Close enough to c for estimation purposes, but maybe I should keep it precise for the calculation.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of this problem, considering the options are in the same order of magnitude, using v = c is acceptable. Let's proceed with that approximation unless I see a reason not to.\n\nSo first, compute the mean lifetime \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But \u0393 is given as 320 MeV. Wait, but \u0127 has units of GeV\u00b7s when considering natural units. Wait, no, let me think.\n\nWait, Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Because \u0127 = h/(2\u03c0), and h is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. But when we convert J to GeV, since 1 GeV is about 1.602e-10 J, so h is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s = (6.626e-34) / (1.602e-10) GeV\u00b7s \u22484.136e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Wait, no, maybe I should look it up. Wait, I think \u0127 is about 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, to compute \u03c4: \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, and \u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) )= (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 s \u224820.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. Let me do this step carefully.\n\n6.582 divided by 0.32. 0.32 * 20 =6.4. So 20 gives 6.4, so 20.5 would be 6.52 (0.32*20.5=6.56). Hmm, maybe better to compute 6.582 / 0.32:\n\n0.32 * 20 = 6.4 \u2192 6.582-6.4=0.182. 0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875. So total is 20.56875. So 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.\n\nSo tau is 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, but wait, the decay width \u0393 is given in MeV, which is 320 MeV. So yes, 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nNow, the decay length is d = v * tau.\n\nIf v is approximately c, which is 3e8 m/s, then d = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are around 4e-15 to 5e-15 m, or 4e-16 to 5e-16.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, 6.582e-25 GeV s divided by 0.32 GeV gives (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s \u2192 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nMultiply by c, 3e8 m/s:\n\n2.056875e-24 s * 3e8 m/s = 6.170625e-16 m. Hmm, but that's 6e-16, which isn't one of the options. The options are A) 5.02e-16, B)4.06e-15, C)5.02e-15, D)4.06e-16.\n\nHmm, none of the options match 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the velocity more accurately. Because if the velocity isn't exactly c, that could change the result.\n\nEarlier, I approximated gamma as 6.6667, and v \u2248 0.9887c. Let's compute it more precisely.\n\nGamma is E/(m c\u00b2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) )= 8/1.2 = 6.6666667.\n\nSo gamma is 6.6666667.\n\nv = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) * c.\n\ngamma^2 = (6.6666667)^2 = 44.444444.\n\n1/gamma^2 = 0.0225.\n\n1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.\n\nsqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, but perhaps more accurately, let's compute it.\n\nWhat's sqrt(0.9775)?\n\nLet me think, sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887? Let me compute 0.9887^2: (0.9887)^2 \u2248 0.9775. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo v is approximately 0.9887 c.\n\nSo v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.\n\nSo the decay length d = v * tau.\n\ntau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nd = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.\n\n2.9661 * 2.056875 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322\n\n2.9661 * 0.056875 \u2248 2.9661 * 0.05 is 0.1483, 2.9661 * 0.006875 \u2248 0.0204. So total \u2248 0.1687.\n\nSo total is approximately 5.9322 + 0.1687 = 6.1009.\n\nSo 6.1009e-16 meters. Which is about 6.1e-16 m.\n\nStill, none of the options match that. The closest option is A)5.02e-16. Hmm, but that's about 1.1e-16 less.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV.\n\ngamma = E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 but since in natural units, c=1, so E/(m) is gamma. So gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.6666667. That part seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for tau is not \u0127/(\u0393), but something else.\n\nWait, the decay width \u0393 is related to the mean lifetime by \u0393 = \u0127 / tau. So tau = \u0127 / \u0393. That part I think is correct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I forgot that for a resonance, the width is \u0393 = \u0127 c / \u03c4, but wait, units can get tricky here.\n\nWait, let me re-express the units.\n\nGamma (\u0393) has units of energy (MeV). \u0127 has units of GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo when computing \u0127 / \u0393, the units are (GeV\u00b7s) / (GeV) ) = s. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps in particle physics, the width is given in MeV, but when calculating with \u0127, perhaps it's more appropriate to express \u0127 in MeV\u00b7s units.\n\nBecause 1 GeV = 1000 MeV. So \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s = 6.582e-22 MeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, yes, because 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV. So 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s = 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV\u00b7s = 6.582e-22 MeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo tau = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV.\n\nSo tau = (6.582e-22 MeV\u00b7s) / (320 MeV) ) = (6.582e-22 / 320) s.\n\n6.582e-22 / 320 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Same as before. So no error here.\n\nHmm, but the decay length is 6e-16 m. None of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe the calculation is correct, but the options have a typo? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, but the formula requires it in GeV. Let me see.\n\nWait, no, because I converted \u0127 to MeV\u00b7s, and \u0393 is in MeV, so the units cancel correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recompute 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s divided by 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that.\n\n6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s \u2192 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nSo decay length is v * tau = 0.9887c * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s. So 0.9887 *3e8 \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.\n\n2.966 *2.056875 \u2248 6.1009.\n\nSo 6.1009e-16 meters.\n\nHmm, so 6.1e-16 m, but the options don't have that. Let's look again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 5.0223e-16 m\n\nB)4.0655e-15 m\n\nC)5.0223e-15 m\n\nD)4.0655e-16 m\n\nHmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot to include the velocity correctly. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the mean lifetime is tau = \u0127 / (\u0393 c^2) ?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because the units wouldn't match. Let me think: \u0393 has units of energy, and \u0127 has units of energy \u00d7 time. So \u0127 / \u0393 gives time. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for lifetime. Because the particle is moving, but the decay width is in its rest frame. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. Because proper time is shorter. So tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point I may have missed earlier. Because the mean lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime by gamma factor.\n\nWait, so the proper lifetime is tau_rest = \u0127 / (\u0393 c^2) ?\n\nWait, no, let's get this right. The decay width \u0393 is related to the mean lifetime tau_rest in the rest frame via \u0393 = \u0127 / tau_rest. So tau_rest = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut when the particle is moving with a Lorentz factor gamma, the lifetime in the lab frame is tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest = gamma * (\u0127 / \u0393).\n\nSo then the mean decay length is d = v * tau_lab = v * gamma * (\u0127 / \u0393).\n\nWait, that changes everything! I think that's where I went wrong earlier. I forgot to multiply by gamma.\n\nAh, so earlier calculation only used tau = \u0127 / \u0393, but the lab frame tau is gamma times that. So I should have done tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.\n\nSo let's redo the calculation with this correction.\n\nTau_rest = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nTau_lab = gamma * tau_rest = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\n6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 \u2248 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nThen decay length d = v * tau_lab.\n\nv is 0.9887c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s \u22482.966e8 m/s.\n\nSo d = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = 2.966 * 1.37125e-15 m.\n\nCompute 2.966 *1.37125.\n\nLet me compute 3 *1.37125 =4.11375. Subtract (0.034 *1.37125) \u2192 0.034 *1.37125\u22480.0466. So 4.11375 - 0.0466 \u22484.067.\n\nSo d \u22484.067e-15 meters. Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think it through.\n\nThe question says X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. \n\nWait, mean decay distance. I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its decay width. The formula, I think, is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393, where \u0393 is the total decay width. But wait, the decay distance would be the mean lifetime multiplied by the particle's velocity, right? Because distance is velocity times time. So, d = v * \u03c4.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check the formula. The mean lifetime \u03c4 is indeed \u0127 divided by the total decay width \u0393. Since \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. Okay, so first I need to calculate \u03c4, then multiply by v to get the decay length.\n\nBut wait, particles like mesons, their velocity depends on their mass and energy. Since the production energy E is given, which is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much higher than the rest mass. So the particle is moving relativistically, meaning v is approximately c. So maybe I can approximate v as the speed of light, c = 3e8 m/s. That would simplify the calculation.\n\nWait, but to be precise, maybe I should compute the velocity using the relativistic energy formula. The total energy E is gamma * m c\u00b2. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). But since m is in GeV/c\u00b2, and E is also in GeV, maybe it's easier to calculate gamma as E/(m) since units would work out in natural units where c=1.\n\nWait, natural units: in particle physics, c=1 and \u0127=1 in appropriate units. But when converting to meters, I have to use actual constants.\n\nWait, let's get the units straight. The mass m_X is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2, E_X is 8 GeV. So the gamma factor is E/(m c\u00b2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 /1.2 \u22486.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.\n\nSo gamma is 6.6667, so the velocity v is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) * c. Let's compute that.\n\nGamma squared is (6.6667)^2 \u224844.444. So 1/gamma\u00b2 is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887 * c. So about 0.9887 times 3e8 m/s. That's roughly 2.966e8 m/s. Close enough to c for estimation purposes, but maybe I should keep it precise for the calculation.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of this problem, considering the options are in the same order of magnitude, using v = c is acceptable. Let's proceed with that approximation unless I see a reason not to.\n\nSo first, compute the mean lifetime \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But \u0393 is given as 320 MeV. Wait, but \u0127 has units of GeV\u00b7s when considering natural units. Wait, no, let me think.\n\nWait, Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Because \u0127 = h/(2\u03c0), and h is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. But when we convert J to GeV, since 1 GeV is about 1.602e-10 J, so h is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s = (6.626e-34) / (1.602e-10) GeV\u00b7s \u22484.136e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Wait, no, maybe I should look it up. Wait, I think \u0127 is about 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, to compute \u03c4: \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, and \u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) )= (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 s \u224820.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. Let me do this step carefully.\n\n6.582 divided by 0.32. 0.32 * 20 =6.4. So 20 gives 6.4, so 20.5 would be 6.52 (0.32*20.5=6.56). Hmm, maybe better to compute 6.582 / 0.32:\n\n0.32 * 20 = 6.4 \u2192 6.582-6.4=0.182. 0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875. So total is 20.56875.

So 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s = 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV\u00b7s = 6.582e-22 MeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo tau = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV.\n\nSo tau = (6.582e-22 MeV\u00b7s) / (320 MeV) ) = (6.582e-22 / 320) s.\n\n6.582e-22 / 320 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Same as before. So no error here.\n\nHmm, but the decay length is 6e-16 m. None of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe the calculation is correct, but the options have a typo? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, but the formula requires it in GeV. Let me see.\n\nWait, no, because I converted \u0127 to MeV\u00b7s, and \u0393 is in MeV, so the units cancel correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recompute 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s divided by 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that.\n\n6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s \u2192 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nSo decay length is v * tau = 0.9887c * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s. So 0.9887 *3e8 \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.\n\n2.966 *2.056875 \u2248 6.1009.\n\nSo 6.1009e-16 meters.\n\nHmm, so 6.1e-16 m, but the options don't have that. Let's look again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 5.0223e-16 m\n\nB)4.0655e-15 m\n\nC)5.0223e-15 m\n\nD)4.0655e-16 m\n\nHmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot to include the velocity correctly. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the mean lifetime is tau = \u0127 / (\u0393 c^2) ?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because the units wouldn't match. Let me think: \u0393 has units of energy, and \u0127 has units of energy \u00d7 time. So \u0127 / \u0393 gives time. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for lifetime. Because the particle is moving, but the decay width is in its rest frame. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. Because proper time is shorter. So tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point I may have missed earlier. Because the mean lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime by gamma factor.\n\nWait, so the proper lifetime is tau_rest = \u0127 / (\u0393 c^2) ?\n\nWait, no, let's get this right. The decay width \u0393 is related to the mean lifetime tau_rest in the rest frame via \u0393 = \u0127 / tau_rest. So tau_rest = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut when the particle is moving with a Lorentz factor gamma, the lifetime in the lab frame is tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest = gamma * (\u0127 / \u0393).\n\nSo then the mean decay length is d = v * tau_lab = v * gamma * (\u0127 / \u0393).\n\nWait, that changes everything! I think that's where I went wrong earlier. I forgot to multiply by gamma.\n\nAh, so earlier calculation only used tau = \u0127 / \u0393, but the lab frame tau is gamma times that. So I should have done tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.\n\nSo let's redo the calculation with this correction.\n\nTau_rest = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nTau_lab = gamma * tau_rest = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\n6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 \u2248 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nThen decay length d = v * tau_lab.\n\nv is 0.9887c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s \u22482.966e8 m/s.\n\nSo d = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = 2.966 * 1.37125e-15 m.\n\nCompute 2.966 *1.37125.\n\nLet me compute 3 *1.37125 =4.11375. Subtract (0.034 *1.37125) \u2192 0.034 *1.37125\u22480.0466. So 4.11375 - 0.0466 \u22484.067.\n\nSo d \u22484.067e-15 meters. Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the relationship between the mean lifetime \\( \\tau \\), the decay width \\( \\Gamma \\), and the velocity \\( v \\) of the particle.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the question says X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles, right? They decay quickly. So the mean decay distance must be related to how long the particle lives before decaying.\n\nThe given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. Wait, I should probably convert all these into the same units. Oh, \u0393 is 320 MeV which is 0.32 GeV. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, \u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nI think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime. Because the decay distance is how far it travels before it decays. So the formula should be something like distance = velocity * lifetime.\n\nRight, the lifetime \u03c4 is related to the width \u0393 by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the lifetime and energy (or mass) have a relationship. The formula I remember is \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, I should make sure. Since \u0393 is the decay width, which is related to the uncertainty in energy, so \u03c4 is inversely proportional to \u0393.\n\nBut wait, wait. The particle has a certain energy, so maybe its velocity isn't just the speed of light? Or is it? Well, for high-energy particles, they are moving relativistically, so maybe we can approximate their speed as the speed of light. That might simplify things.\n\nSo first, let's compute the lifetime \u03c4. \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But I need to make sure about the units. Let's see, \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. Its value is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So \u0393 is in GeV, so the units would be GeV\u00b7s divided by GeV, so seconds. Correct.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let's compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, but that seems really short. Wait, is that right? Because the width is \u0393, so the lifetime is inversely proportional to \u0393. Since \u0393 is 0.32 GeV, which is a large width, the lifetime should be short. That makes sense.\n\nNext, the velocity. I think for high-energy particles, we can approximate v \u2248 c, where c is the speed of light. Let me check if that's a valid assumption. The energy E is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the rest mass is 1.2 GeV, and the kinetic energy is E - m c\u00b2, but wait, the units are in GeV, and mass is in GeV/c\u00b2, so perhaps we should consider relativistic factors.\n\nWait, the energy E is the total energy, which is \u03b3 m c\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. So gamma would be E/(m c\u00b2). But since the units are in GeV, and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, E is in GeV. So E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2 \u2192 \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). Wait, but since the units are all in energy terms, maybe it's easier to compute gamma as E/m. Let me see: E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 but since E is in GeV and m c\u00b2 would be in GeV as well (because m is GeV/c\u00b2, c\u00b2 is (m/s)^2, but when multiplied by m, it's GeV), so yeah, \u03b3 = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.\n\nBut for the velocity, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Hmm. Let's compute that. 1/\u03b3 is 1/6.6667 \u2248 0.15. So 1/\u03b3 squared is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is about 0.9887. So v \u2248 c * 0.9887. That's pretty close to c. So for the purpose of calculating the mean decay distance, which is v * \u03c4, we can probably approximate v as c.\n\nSo now, the mean decay distance L is v * \u03c4 \u2248 c * \u03c4. c is about 3e8 meters per second.\n\nSo L = c * \u03c4 = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s. Let me compute that.\n\n3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I see options in 1e-15 and 1e-16 m. Hmm. Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the tau. Let me recheck.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nTau = \u0127 / \u0393. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = let's compute that more accurately.\n\n0.32 \u00d7 20 = 6.4, 6.4 + 0.182 is 6.582. So 20.56875.\n\nSo 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nSo L = c * tau \u2248 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 4.0655e-16 m, option A is 5.0223e-16 m. Hmm, my calculation gives around 6.17e-16, but none of the options match. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the energy is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the particle is moving at a certain velocity, but perhaps I shouldn't approximate v as c. Let me think again.\n\nThe total energy E is given, and the mass is m. So the velocity can be found from relativistic equations. Let's see.\n\nE\u00b2 = (p c)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nSo p = sqrt( (E/(c\u00b2))\u00b2 - m\u00b2 ) / c.\n\nWait, let me get that right. E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.\n\nSo (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.\n\nThus, p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2).\n\nBut I'm not sure about the units here. Alternatively, perhaps I can find gamma in terms of E and m.\n\nAs I did before, gamma is E/(m c^2), but since E and m are in GeV and GeV/c\u00b2, I think gamma is just E/m. Because E = gamma m c\u00b2, so gamma = E/(m c\u00b2). But since m c\u00b2 is (GeV/c\u00b2)*c\u00b2 = GeV, so gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 6.666..., as I found earlier.\n\nSo gamma = 6.6667.\n\nThen, the velocity v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) = c * sqrt(1 - (1/(6.6667)^2)).\n\n1/(6.6667)^2 = 1/(44.444) \u2248 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.\n\nsqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887 c.\n\nSo when I compute L = v * tau, it's 0.9887 c * tau.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I used c * tau, but actually it's 0.9887 c * tau.\n\nSo L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCompute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 approximately 6.1e-16 * 0.99 \u2248 6.04e-16 m. Still around 6e-16, which isn't matching any of the options.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau. Let me think again about the formula. The mean lifetime is tau = \u0127 / (Gamma), right? Gamma is the total decay width, which is related to the uncertainty in energy, so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, but I converted it to GeV. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is in the calculation of the velocity. Alternatively, perhaps the mean decay length formula is different. Wait, another approach: the decay length can be calculated using L = c * tau * beta gamma, where beta is v/c and gamma is the Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed a factor of gamma in the velocity.\n\nWait, another formula for the mean decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nBecause tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. And the velocity is beta c, so L = v * (gamma tau) ) = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nWait, wait, let's clarify. The proper lifetime is tau. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. So the particle is moving for a time gamma tau. So the distance is v * gamma tau.\n\nBut v = beta c. So L = beta c gamma tau.\n\nBut gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2), so beta gamma = gamma beta.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is L = gamma * beta c * tau.\n\nWait, let me think. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. The velocity is beta c. So distance is v * t_lab = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nSo L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nHmm, but earlier I thought of L = beta c * tau, but that was incorrect because tau is the proper lifetime. So the correct formula is L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nSo I need to compute beta and gamma. Gamma is 6.6667, as before. Beta is v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo beta gamma = 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.6667 * approx 0.9887. Let me compute that.\n\n6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.6667 * (1 - 0.0113) = 6.6667 - (6.6667 * 0.0113) \u2248 6.6667 - 0.0754 \u2248 6.5913.\n\nSo beta gamma is approximately 6.5913.\n\nThen L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nMultiply 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 6.5913: 6.170625e-16 *6.5913 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n6 * 6.5913 is 39.5478. 0.170625 *6.5913 \u2248 approx 1.123.\n\nSo total is about 39.5478 + 1.123 \u2248 40.67e-16 m, which is 4.067e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's 4.067e-15 meters, which is close to option C (5.02e-15) and option B (4.065e-15). Hmm, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this.\n\nWait, so let's compute it more accurately.\n\n6.5913 * 6.170625e-16.\n\nLet me compute 6.5913 * 6.170625.\n\n6 * 6.170625 = 37.02375.\n\n0.5913 *6.170625: Let's compute 0.5 *6.170625 =3.0853125, 0.0913 *6.170625 \u2248 0.563.\n\nSo total for 0.5913 *6.170625 is approx 3.0853 + 0.563 \u22483.6483.\n\nSo 37.02375 +3.6483 \u224840.67205.\n\nSo 40.67205e-16 m is 4.067205e-15 m.\n\nWhich matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check all the steps because the initial approach gave a different result.\n\nSo the crucial point was realizing that the decay length isn't just v * tau, but v * gamma tau. Because tau is the proper lifetime, and the lab frame lifetime is longer by gamma. So L = v * gamma tau.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute gamma: gamma = E/m =8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 6.6667.\n\n2. Compute beta: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) \u2248 0.9887.\n\n3. Compute tau: tau = \u0127 / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\n4.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the question says X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles, right? They decay quickly. So the mean decay distance must be related to how long the particle lives before decaying.\n\nThe given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. Wait, I should probably convert all these into the same units. Oh, \u0393 is 320 MeV which is 0.32 GeV. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, \u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nI think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime. Because the decay distance is how far it travels before it decays. So the formula should be something like distance = velocity * lifetime.\n\nRight, the lifetime \u03c4 is related to the width \u0393 by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the lifetime and energy (or mass) have a relationship. The formula I remember is \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, I should make sure. Since \u0393 is the decay width, which is related to the uncertainty in energy, so \u03c4 is inversely proportional to \u0393.\n\nBut wait, wait. The particle has a certain energy, so maybe its velocity isn't just the speed of light? Or is it? Well, for high-energy particles, they are moving relativistically, so maybe we can approximate their speed as the speed of light. That might simplify things.\n\nSo first, let's compute the lifetime \u03c4. \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But I need to make sure about the units. Let's see, \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. Its value is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So \u0393 is in GeV, so the units would be GeV\u00b7s divided by GeV, so seconds. Correct.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let's compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, but that seems really short. Wait, is that right? Because the width is \u0393, so the lifetime is inversely proportional to \u0393. Since \u0393 is 0.32 GeV, which is a large width, the lifetime should be short. That makes sense.\n\nNext, the velocity. I think for high-energy particles, we can approximate v \u2248 c, where c is the speed of light. Let me check if that's a valid assumption. The energy E is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the rest mass is 1.2 GeV, and the kinetic energy is E - m c\u00b2, but wait, the units are in GeV, and mass is in GeV/c\u00b2, so perhaps we should consider relativistic factors.\n\nWait, the energy E is the total energy, which is \u03b3 m c\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. So gamma would be E/(m c\u00b2). But since the units are in GeV, and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, E is in GeV. So E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2 \u2192 \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). Wait, but since the units are all in energy terms, maybe it's easier to compute gamma as E/m. Let me see: E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 but since E is in GeV and m c\u00b2 would be in GeV as well (because m is GeV/c\u00b2, c\u00b2 is (m/s)^2, but when multiplied by m, it's GeV), so yeah, \u03b3 = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.\n\nBut for the velocity, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Hmm. Let's compute that. 1/\u03b3 is 1/6.6667 \u2248 0.15. So 1/\u03b3 squared is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is about 0.9887. So v \u2248 c * 0.9887. That's pretty close to c. So for the purpose of calculating the mean decay distance, which is v * \u03c4, we can probably approximate v as c.\n\nSo now, the mean decay distance L is v * \u03c4 \u2248 c * \u03c4. c is about 3e8 meters per second.\n\nSo L = c * \u03c4 = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s. Let me compute that.\n\n3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I see options in 1e-15 and 1e-16 m. Hmm. Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the tau. Let me recheck.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nTau = \u0127 / \u0393. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = let's compute that more accurately.\n\n0.32 \u00d7 20 = 6.4, 6.4 + 0.182 is 6.582. So 20.56875.\n\nSo 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nSo L = c * tau \u2248 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 4.0655e-16 m, option A is 5.0223e-16 m. Hmm, my calculation gives around 6.17e-16, but none of the options match. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the energy is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the particle is moving at a certain velocity, but perhaps I shouldn't approximate v as c. Let me think again.\n\nThe total energy E is given, and the mass is m. So the velocity can be found from relativistic equations. Let's see.\n\nE\u00b2 = (p c)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nSo p = sqrt( (E/(c\u00b2))\u00b2 - m\u00b2 ) / c.\n\nWait, let me get that right. E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.\n\nSo (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.\n\nThus, p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2).\n\nBut I'm not sure about the units here. Alternatively, perhaps I can find gamma in terms of E and m.\n\nAs I did before, gamma is E/(m c^2), but since E and m are in GeV and GeV/c\u00b2, I think gamma is just E/m. Because E = gamma m c\u00b2, so gamma = E/(m c\u00b2). But since m c\u00b2 is (GeV/c\u00b2)*c\u00b2 = GeV, so gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 6.666..., as I found earlier.\n\nSo gamma = 6.6667.\n\nThen, the velocity v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) = c * sqrt(1 - (1/(6.6667)^2)).\n\n1/(6.6667)^2 = 1/(44.444) \u2248 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.\n\nsqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887 c.\n\nSo when I compute L = v * tau, it's 0.9887 c * tau.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I used c * tau, but actually it's 0.9887 c * tau.\n\nSo L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCompute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 approximately 6.1e-16 * 0.99 \u2248 6.04e-16 m. Still around 6e-16, which isn't matching any of the options.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau. Let me think again about the formula. The mean lifetime is tau = \u0127 / (Gamma), right? Gamma is the total decay width, which is related to the uncertainty in energy, so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, but I converted it to GeV. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is in the calculation of the velocity. Alternatively, perhaps the mean decay length formula is different. Wait, another approach: the decay length can be calculated using L = c * tau * beta gamma, where beta is v/c and gamma is the Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed a factor of gamma in the velocity.\n\nWait, another formula for the mean decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nBecause tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. And the velocity is beta c, so L = v * (gamma tau) ) = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nWait, wait, let's clarify. The proper lifetime is tau. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. So the particle is moving for a time gamma tau. So the distance is v * gamma tau.\n\nBut v = beta c. So L = beta c gamma tau.\n\nBut gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2), so beta gamma = gamma beta.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is L = gamma * beta c * tau.\n\nWait, let me think. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. The velocity is beta c. So distance is v * t_lab = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nSo L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nHmm, but earlier I thought of L = beta c * tau, but that was incorrect because tau is the proper lifetime. So the correct formula is L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nSo I need to compute beta and gamma. Gamma is 6.6667, as before. Beta is v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo beta gamma = 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.6667 * approx 0.9887. Let me compute that.\n\n6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.6667 * (1 - 0.0113) = 6.6667 - (6.6667 * 0.0113) \u2248 6.6667 - 0.0754 \u2248 6.5913.\n\nSo beta gamma is approximately 6.5913.\n\nThen L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nMultiply 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 6.5913: 6.170625e-16 *6.5913 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n6 * 6.5913 is 39.5478. 0.170625 *6.5913 \u2248 approx 1.123.\n\nSo total is about 39.5478 + 1.123 \u2248 40.67e-16 m, which is 4.067e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's 4.067e-15 meters, which is close to option C (5.02e-15) and option B (4.065e-15). Hmm, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this.\n\nWait, so let's compute it more accurately.\n\n6.5913 * 6.170625e-16.\n\nLet me compute 6.5913 * 6.170625.\n\n6 * 6.170625 = 37.02375.\n\n0.5913 *6.170625: Let's compute 0.5 *6.170625 =3.0853125, 0.0913 *6.170625 \u2248 0.563.\n\nSo total for 0.5913 *6.170625 is approx 3.0853 + 0.563 \u22483.6483.\n\nSo 37.02375 +3.6483 \u224840.67205.\n\nSo 40.67205e-16 m is 4.067205e-15 m.\n\nWhich matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check all the steps because the initial approach gave a different result.\n\nSo the crucial point was realizing that the decay length isn't just v * tau, but v * gamma tau. Because tau is the proper lifetime, and the lab frame lifetime is longer by gamma. So L = v * gamma tau.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute gamma: gamma = E/m =8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 6.6667.\n\n2. Compute beta: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) \u2248 0.9887.\n\n3. Compute tau: tau = \u0127 / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\n4. Compute L = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nBeta * gamma \u2248 6.5913.\n\nc * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen, L = 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 \u224840.67e-16 m = 4.067e-15 m.\n\nWhich matches option B, 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the formula for the decay length:\n\n\\[\nL = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\beta = v/c \\) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,\n- \\( \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} \\) is the Lorentz factor,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light,\n- \\( \\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} \\) is the proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( \\gamma \\)\nThe total energy \\( E \\) and mass \\( m \\) are given as \\( E = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) and \\( m = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember from my classes that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're usually made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about a meson resonance, X. I think resonances are particles that exist for a very short time because they're unstable.\n\nThe question is asking for the mean decay distance of this meson. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are A through D, with various distances in meters.\n\nI remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh wait, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is approximately h-bar. So, \u0393 is the uncertainty in energy, which relates to the mean lifetime \u03c4. The formula should be \u0393 * \u03c4 \u2248 h-bar, so \u03c4 \u2248 h-bar / \u0393. \n\nBut wait, I also need to consider units. Let me think: \u0393 is given in MeV, and I need to convert that into compatible units with Planck's constant. Because h-bar is usually expressed in units like J\u00b7s, but I need to convert everything to the same system.\n\nWait, I think the formula for the mean lifetime \u03c4 is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But since \u0393 is the total decay width, which has units of energy, and \u0127 has units of J\u00b7s, I'll need to convert \u0393 from MeV to Joules.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to use natural units first. Natural units are where \u0127 = c = 1. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach here. Alternatively, I can convert the units properly.\n\nSo, first, let's compute the mean lifetime \u03c4. \u0393 is 320 MeV. I need to convert \u0393 to Joules. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. Let's compute that:\n\n\u0393 (Joules) = 320e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = let's see, 320e6 is 3.2e8, so 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-11 J.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation. 320 MeV is 320 * 10^6 eV. So 320e6 eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = (320 * 1.602) * 1e6 * 1e-19 = 512.64 * 1e-13 = 5.1264e-11 J.\n\nNow, \u0127 (h-bar) is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.1264e-11 J) = let's compute that.\n\n1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = approximately (1.0545718 / 5.1264) * 1e-23. Let me compute 1.0545718 / 5.1264. Hmm, 5.1264 is roughly 5, so 1.05/5 is about 0.21. Let me get more precise. 5.1264 * 0.205 is about 1.055, so that's close. So 0.2056. So \u03c4 \u2248 0.2056e-23 seconds, which is 2.056e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, that seems really short. Did I do the exponents right? Let me recalculate:\n\n1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = (1.0545718 / 5.1264) * 1e-34 / 1e-11 = (approx 0.2056) * 1e-23 = 2.056e-24 seconds.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the mean lifetime is about 2.056e-24 seconds.\n\nBut wait, the mean decay distance isn't just the lifetime multiplied by the speed, right? Because the particle is moving, so the distance it travels before decaying is v * \u03c4.\n\nSo I need to find the velocity of the meson. To find v, I can use the relativistic energy formula. The production energy is E_X = 8 GeV, and the rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the total energy is 8 GeV, and the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. Let's compute the gamma factor (Lorentz factor) gamma = E / (m c\u00b2). But since we're working in units where c=1 (as in natural units), gamma is just E / m.\n\nSo gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nGamma is 6.6667. Then, the velocity v can be found using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Since c=1 in natural units, it's 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute beta (\u03b2) which is v/c. So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)). Let's compute 1/gamma\u00b2: 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) = 1/( (6.6667)^2 ) = 1/(44.4444) \u2248 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887c.\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately. Gamma is 8/1.2 = 20/3 \u22486.6667. So gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u224844.4444. So 1/gamma\u00b2 is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - (1/gamma\u00b2) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887c.\n\nThe speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.\n\nSo v \u2248 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance is L = v * \u03c4.\n\nWe have v \u2248 2.966e8 m/s, and \u03c4 \u2248 2.056e-24 s.\n\nSo L \u2248 2.966e8 * 2.056e-24 = Let's compute that. 2.966e8 * 2.056e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056) * 1e8-24 = (approx 6.11) * 1e-16 = 6.11e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but none of the options are around 6e-16 meters. The options are A:5.02e-16, B:4.06e-15, etc. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me check each step.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me recompute beta.\n\nGamma is E/(m c^2), but in units where c=1, it's E/m. So gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.\n\nGamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So, sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2) = 1/gamma = 3/20 = 0.15. So 1 - beta^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. Therefore, beta^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) = approximately 0.9887. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should use more precise numbers. Let me calculate sqrt(0.9775) more accurately. Let's compute 0.9775. Let me think: 0.9887^2 is (0.9887)^2 = 0.9775 approximately, but let's compute 0.9887 squared:\n\n0.9887 * 0.9887:\n\nCalculate 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.\n\nBut 0.9887 is 0.98 + 0.0087.\n\nSo (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2 = 0.9604 + 0.0172 + 0.00007569 \u2248 0.97767569, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So perhaps the actual beta is a bit less than 0.9887, maybe 0.9885 or so. But for the purposes of this calculation, perhaps it's better to compute beta exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate beta as sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nGamma is 6.6667, so 1/gamma^2 is (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.\n\nTaking the square root of 0.9775.\n\nI can compute sqrt(0.9775) as follows: sqrt(0.9775) = approximately 0.9887 as I thought before. Let's just go with that for now.\n\nSo v is 0.9887c, which is about 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nNow, the mean lifetime \u03c4 is 2.056e-24 seconds.\n\nSo L = v * \u03c4 = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056) * 1e8-24 = let's compute 2.966 * 2.056.\n\n2.966 * 2 = 5.932.\n\n2.966 * 0.056 = approximately 0.1657.\n\nSo total is about 5.932 + 0.1657 = 6.0977.\n\nSo L \u2248 6.0977e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but the options don't have that. Hmm. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nHmm, none of them are 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the lifetime.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should use the formula for the mean path, which is L = (E * c * \u03c4) / m.\n\nWait, but let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the mean decay length is given by L = (gamma * beta * c) * tau.\n\nBecause gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, so gamma beta c is v. So yeah, L = v * tau.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute gamma beta c tau. Let me think.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the mean path can be calculated using the relation:\n\nL = (E^2) / (m * c^2 * \u0393) ) * c * tau ?\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the decay length, which is L = (gamma * beta * c) * tau.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the decay length is given by L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Because gamma is the time dilation factor, so the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. Then, the decay length is v * (gamma tau_0) = gamma beta c tau_0.\n\nWait, but tau is the mean lifetime, which is gamma tau_0. So tau = gamma tau_0. So L = v tau = gamma beta c tau_0 * gamma tau_0? No, that would be L = gamma^2 beta c tau_0^2. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start over.\n\nThe proper mean lifetime tau_0 is h-bar / Gamma. Then, the mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0.\n\nThen, the mean decay distance is L = v * tau = gamma beta c * tau_0.\n\nSo, L = gamma beta c (h-bar / Gamma).\n\nWait, Gamma is given in MeV, but we have to make sure the units are correct. Alternatively, perhaps using natural units where c=1, h-bar=1, and so on, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for the decay length.\n\nThe decay length L is given by L = (E^2)/(m * Gamma) * (c tau), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the mean decay length: L = (E * c * tau) / m.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV.\n\nE/m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667, same as gamma.\n\nSo L = (E c tau) / m = gamma c tau.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated tau as h-bar / Gamma. So L = gamma c (h-bar / Gamma).\n\nHmm, let me compute that.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Gamma = 0.32 GeV.\n\nh-bar is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s (I remember that in particle physics, h-bar is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s).\n\nSo tau = h-bar / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s \u2248 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo tau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nThen, L = gamma * c * tau.\n\ngamma is 6.6667, c is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 6.6667 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCompute 6.6667 * 3e8 = 2e9 (approx). 2e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 4.11375e-15 meters.\n\nWait, that's 4.11375e-15 m. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15. Hmm, but 4.11e-15 is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nBut wait, perhaps my approximation of h-bar as 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s is correct.\n\nWait, let me compute it more precisely.\n\nh-bar = 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau = h-bar / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo tau = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nThen, L = gamma * c * tau.\n\ngamma is 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 \u22486.6666667.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = (20/3) * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, 20/3 * 3e8 is 20e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 20e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 20e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 = 41.1375e-16 m = 4.11375e-15 m.\n\nWhich is 4.11375e-15 meters, which is approximately 4.11e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15 m. So 4.11e-15 is closer to option B.\n\nWait, but in the initial calculation when I used v = 0.9887c and multiplied by tau, I got around 6e-16 m. But this approach using L = gamma * c * tau gives about 4.11e-15 m. So which is correct?\n\nHmm, I think I must have made a mistake in the first approach. Because when I did the first method, I used v = beta c and tau, but perhaps I forgot that tau is the mean lifetime in the rest frame, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, not tau. Wait, no: in the first approach, I calculated tau as the mean lifetime in the lab frame, right? Because I used the uncertainty principle in the lab frame, perhaps.\n\nWait, no. The mean lifetime tau is the proper lifetime, as observed in the rest frame. So when the particle is moving, its lifetime is gamma tau. So the mean decay distance is v * gamma tau. So that would be L = v gamma tau.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe proper mean lifetime tau_0 is h-bar / Gamma. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0.\n\nSo the decay length is L = v tau = v gamma tau_0.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I calculated tau as h-bar / Gamma, which is tau_0, the proper lifetime. Then, I used v * tau_0, but that's incorrect because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the correct decay length is L = v * tau = v gamma tau_0.\n\nAlternatively, in the first approach, I used tau = tau_0, which is incorrect. So perhaps in the first calculation, I should have multiplied by gamma.\n\nWait, in the first calculation, I used tau as 2.056e-24 s, which is tau_0. But in reality, the lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma tau_0, so the decay length is v * gamma tau_0.\n\nWait, that's where I made a mistake earlier. I calculated tau as tau_0, but it should have been gamma tau_0.\n\nSo let's redo that.\n\ntau_0 = h-bar / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nThen, tau = gamma tau_0 = (8 GeV / 1.2 GeV) * 2.056875e-24 s = (6.6667) * 2.056875e-24 s \u2248 1.371e-23 s.\n\nWait, no, 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 is approximately 13.71e-24 s, which is 1.371e-23 s.\n\nThen, L = v * tau = (0.9887 * 3e8 m/s) * 1.371e-23 s.\n\nCompute 0.9887 * 3e8 \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 1.371e-23 s: 2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 = (2.966 * 1.371) * 1e-15 \u2248 4.065 * 1e-15 m. So L \u2248 4.065e-15 m.\n\nWhich matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nAh, that makes sense now. So I must have forgotten to multiply by gamma in the first approach, leading to an incorrect L of around 6e-16. But when I properly account for the lab frame lifetime being gamma times longer, I get L \u22484.065e-15 m, which is option B.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember from my classes that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're usually made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about a meson resonance, X. I think resonances are particles that exist for a very short time because they're unstable.\n\nThe question is asking for the mean decay distance of this meson. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are A through D, with various distances in meters.\n\nI remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh wait, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is approximately h-bar. So, \u0393 is the uncertainty in energy, which relates to the mean lifetime \u03c4. The formula should be \u0393 * \u03c4 \u2248 h-bar, so \u03c4 \u2248 h-bar / \u0393. \n\nBut wait, I also need to consider units. Let me think: \u0393 is given in MeV, and I need to convert that into compatible units with Planck's constant. Because h-bar is usually expressed in units like J\u00b7s, but I need to convert everything to the same system.\n\nWait, I think the formula for the mean lifetime \u03c4 is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But since \u0393 is the total decay width, which has units of energy, and \u0127 has units of J\u00b7s, I'll need to convert \u0393 from MeV to Joules.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to use natural units first. Natural units are where \u0127 = c = 1. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach here. Alternatively, I can convert the units properly.\n\nSo, first, let's compute the mean lifetime \u03c4. \u0393 is 320 MeV. I need to convert \u0393 to Joules. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. Let's compute that:\n\n\u0393 (Joules) = 320e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = let's see, 320e6 is 3.2e8, so 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-11 J.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation. 320 MeV is 320 * 10^6 eV. So 320e6 eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = (320 * 1.602) * 1e6 * 1e-19 = 512.64 * 1e-13 = 5.1264e-11 J.\n\nNow, \u0127 (h-bar) is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.1264e-11 J) = let's compute that.\n\n1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = approximately (1.0545718 / 5.1264) * 1e-23. Let me compute 1.0545718 / 5.1264. Hmm, 5.1264 is roughly 5, so 1.05/5 is about 0.21. Let me get more precise. 5.1264 * 0.205 is about 1.055, so that's close. So 0.2056. So \u03c4 \u2248 0.2056e-23 seconds, which is 2.056e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, that seems really short. Did I do the exponents right? Let me recalculate:\n\n1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = (1.0545718 / 5.1264) * 1e-34 / 1e-11 = (approx 0.2056) * 1e-23 = 2.056e-24 seconds.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the mean lifetime is about 2.056e-24 seconds.\n\nBut wait, the mean decay distance isn't just the lifetime multiplied by the speed, right? Because the particle is moving, so the distance it travels before decaying is v * \u03c4.\n\nSo I need to find the velocity of the meson. To find v, I can use the relativistic energy formula. The production energy is E_X = 8 GeV, and the rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the total energy is 8 GeV, and the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. Let's compute the gamma factor (Lorentz factor) gamma = E / (m c\u00b2). But since we're working in units where c=1 (as in natural units), gamma is just E / m.\n\nSo gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nGamma is 6.6667. Then, the velocity v can be found using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Since c=1 in natural units, it's 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute beta (\u03b2) which is v/c. So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)). Let's compute 1/gamma\u00b2: 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) = 1/( (6.6667)^2 ) = 1/(44.4444) \u2248 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887c.\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately. Gamma is 8/1.2 = 20/3 \u22486.6667. So gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u224844.4444. So 1/gamma\u00b2 is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - (1/gamma\u00b2) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887c.\n\nThe speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.\n\nSo v \u2248 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance is L = v * \u03c4.\n\nWe have v \u2248 2.966e8 m/s, and \u03c4 \u2248 2.056e-24 s.\n\nSo L \u2248 2.966e8 * 2.056e-24 = Let's compute that. 2.966e8 * 2.056e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056) * 1e8-24 = (approx 6.11) * 1e-16 = 6.11e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but none of the options are around 6e-16 meters. The options are A:5.02e-16, B:4.06e-15, etc. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me check each step.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me recompute beta.\n\nGamma is E/(m c^2), but in units where c=1, it's E/m. So gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.\n\nGamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So, sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2) = 1/gamma = 3/20 = 0.15. So 1 - beta^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. Therefore, beta^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) = approximately 0.9887. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should use more precise numbers. Let me calculate sqrt(0.9775) more accurately. Let's compute 0.9775. Let me think: 0.9887^2 is (0.9887)^2 = 0.9775 approximately, but let's compute 0.9887 squared:\n\n0.9887 * 0.9887:\n\nCalculate 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.\n\nBut 0.9887 is 0.98 + 0.0087.\n\nSo (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2 = 0.9604 + 0.0172 + 0.00007569 \u2248 0.97767569, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So perhaps the actual beta is a bit less than 0.9887, maybe 0.9885 or so. But for the purposes of this calculation, perhaps it's better to compute beta exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate beta as sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nGamma is 6.6667, so 1/gamma^2 is (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.\n\nTaking the square root of 0.9775.\n\nI can compute sqrt(0.9775) as follows: sqrt(0.9775) = approximately 0.9887 as I thought before. Let's just go with that for now.\n\nSo v is 0.9887c, which is about 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nNow, the mean lifetime \u03c4 is 2.056e-24 seconds.\n\nSo L = v * \u03c4 = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056) * 1e8-24 = let's compute 2.966 * 2.056.\n\n2.966 * 2 = 5.932.\n\n2.966 * 0.056 = approximately 0.1657.\n\nSo total is about 5.932 + 0.1657 = 6.0977.\n\nSo L \u2248 6.0977e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but the options don't have that. Hmm. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nHmm, none of them are 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the lifetime.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should use the formula for the mean path, which is L = (E * c * \u03c4) / m.\n\nWait, but let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the mean decay length is given by L = (gamma * beta * c) * tau.\n\nBecause gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, so gamma beta c is v. So yeah, L = v * tau.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute gamma beta c tau. Let me think.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the mean path can be calculated using the relation:\n\nL = (E^2) / (m * c^2 * \u0393) ) * c * tau ?\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the decay length, which is L = (gamma * beta * c) * tau.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the decay length is given by L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Because gamma is the time dilation factor, so the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. Then, the decay length is v * (gamma tau_0) = gamma beta c tau_0.\n\nWait, but tau is the mean lifetime, which is gamma tau_0. So tau = gamma tau_0. So L = v tau = gamma beta c tau_0 * gamma tau_0? No, that would be L = gamma^2 beta c tau_0^2. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start over.\n\nThe proper mean lifetime tau_0 is h-bar / Gamma. Then, the mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0.\n\nThen, the mean decay distance is L = v * tau = gamma beta c * tau_0.\n\nSo, L = gamma beta c (h-bar / Gamma).\n\nWait, Gamma is given in MeV, but we have to make sure the units are correct. Alternatively, perhaps using natural units where c=1, h-bar=1, and so on, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for the decay length.\n\nThe decay length L is given by L = (E^2)/(m * Gamma) * (c tau), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the mean decay length: L = (E * c * tau) / m.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV.\n\nE/m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667, same as gamma.\n\nSo L = (E c tau) / m = gamma c tau.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated tau as h-bar / Gamma. So L = gamma c (h-bar / Gamma).\n\nHmm, let me compute that.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Gamma = 0.32 GeV.\n\nh-bar is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s (I remember that in particle physics, h-bar is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s).\n\nSo tau = h-bar / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s \u2248 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo tau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nThen, L = gamma * c * tau.\n\ngamma is 6.6667, c is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 6.6667 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCompute 6.6667 * 3e8 = 2e9 (approx). 2e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 4.11375e-15 meters.\n\nWait, that's 4.11375e-15 m. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15. Hmm, but 4.11e-15 is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nBut wait, perhaps my approximation of h-bar as 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s is correct.\n\nWait, let me compute it more precisely.\n\nh-bar = 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau = h-bar / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo tau = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nThen, L = gamma * c * tau.\n\ngamma is 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 \u22486.6666667.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = (20/3) * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, 20/3 * 3e8 is 20e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 20e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 20e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 = 41.1375e-16 m = 4.11375e-15 m.\n\nWhich is 4.11375e-15 meters, which is approximately 4.11e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15 m. So 4.11e-15 is closer to option B.\n\nWait, but in the initial calculation when I used v = 0.9887c and multiplied by tau, I got around 6e-16 m. But this approach using L = gamma * c * tau gives about 4.11e-15 m. So which is correct?\n\nHmm, I think I must have made a mistake in the first approach. Because when I did the first method, I used v = beta c and tau, but perhaps I forgot that tau is the mean lifetime in the rest frame, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, not tau. Wait, no: in the first approach, I calculated tau as the mean lifetime in the lab frame, right? Because I used the uncertainty principle in the lab frame, perhaps.\n\nWait, no. The mean lifetime tau is the proper lifetime, as observed in the rest frame. So when the particle is moving, its lifetime is gamma tau. So the mean decay distance is v * gamma tau. So that would be L = v gamma tau.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe proper mean lifetime tau_0 is h-bar / Gamma. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0.\n\nSo the decay length is L = v tau = v gamma tau_0.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I calculated tau as h-bar / Gamma, which is tau_0, the proper lifetime. Then, I used v * tau_0, but that's incorrect because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the correct decay length is L = v * tau = v gamma tau_0.\n\nAlternatively, in the first approach, I used tau = tau_0, which is incorrect. So perhaps in the first calculation, I should have multiplied by gamma.\n\nWait, in the first calculation, I used tau as 2.056e-24 s, which is tau_0. But in reality, the lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma tau_0, so the decay length is v * gamma tau_0.\n\nWait, that's where I made a mistake earlier. I calculated tau as tau_0, but it should have been gamma tau_0.\n\nSo let's redo that.\n\ntau_0 = h-bar / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nThen, tau = gamma tau_0 = (8 GeV / 1.2 GeV) * 2.056875e-24 s = (6.6667) * 2.056875e-24 s \u2248 1.371e-23 s.\n\nWait, no, 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 is approximately 13.71e-24 s, which is 1.371e-23 s.\n\nThen, L = v * tau = (0.9887 * 3e8 m/s) * 1.371e-23 s.\n\nCompute 0.9887 * 3e8 \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 1.371e-23 s: 2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 = (2.966 * 1.371) * 1e-15 \u2248 4.065 * 1e-15 m. So L \u2248 4.065e-15 m.\n\nWhich matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nAh, that makes sense now. So I must have forgotten to multiply by gamma in the first approach, leading to an incorrect L of around 6e-16. But when I properly account for the lab frame lifetime being gamma times longer, I get L \u22484.065e-15 m, which is option B.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the following data:\n\n- Production energy: \\( E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\)\n- Mass: \\( m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} \\)\n- Decay width: \\( \\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\)\n\n### Step 1: Proper Mean Lifetime\nThe proper mean lifetime \\( \\tau_0 \\) is related to the decay width \\( \\Gamma \\) via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n\\[\n\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\n\\]\nIn natural units where \\( \\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s} \\), we calculate:\n\\[\n\\tau_0 = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \\approx 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Lorentz Factor\nThe Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X} = \\frac{8}{1.2} \\approx 6.6667\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Lab Frame Mean Lifetime\nThe mean lifetime in the lab frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor:\n\\[\n\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 6.6667 \\times 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\approx 1.371 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Decay Distance\nThe mean decay distance \\( L \\) is the product of the velocity \\( v \\) and the lab frame lifetime \\( \\tau \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.\n\nThe question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. So, I'm dealing with very tiny distances, which makes sense for particles decaying quickly.\n\nWait, mesons are bosons, right? And they have a short lifetime, which would mean a small decay distance. But how do I calculate that?\n\nI remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula I think is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393, where \u0393 is the decay width. Oh, but wait, \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 is in units of GeV\u00b7s or something like that. I need to make sure the units match.\n\nLet me jot down the constants. Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7seconds. Oh, right, because \u0127 is about 197 MeV\u00b7fm, but converting that into GeV and seconds might be better here.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, \u0393 is given in MeV. Let's convert \u0393 into GeV. \u0393_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 seconds. Let me calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So, 20.56875e-25 seconds. Which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's the lifetime.\n\nNow, the decay distance is the mean lifetime multiplied by the velocity of the particle. So, I need to find the velocity. But how?\n\nThe velocity can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X, and its mass is m_X, I can find its momentum and then its velocity.\n\nThe energy E is given by E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2. Let me solve for p.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So, E\u00b2 = (8)^2 = 64 (GeV)^2. m\u00b2c^4 is (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2. So, (pc)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So, pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV. What's the square root of 62.56? Let me see, 7.91 squared is 62.56, because 7.9^2 is 62.41, 7.91^2 is 62.5681, which is close enough. So, pc \u2248 7.91 GeV. Therefore, p = 7.91 GeV / c.\n\nWait, but I need the velocity v. The velocity can be found from the relation p = gamma m v. Or perhaps using beta (\u03b2 = v/c) in terms of momentum and energy.\n\nAnother approach: beta (\u03b2) is p c / E. Because p c is in units of GeV when E is in GeV.\n\nSo, beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) ) = 7.91 / 8 \u2248 0.98875. So, v is approximately 0.98875 c.\n\nSo, the velocity is about 0.98875 times the speed of light. Now, the speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. So, v \u2248 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance is L = v * \u03c4. So, let's compute that.\n\nWe have \u03c4 as 2.056875e-24 seconds. Multiply by v.\n\nL = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = let's compute that.\n\n2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (6.108) * 1e-16 m. So, approximately 6.108e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but none of the options are near 6e-16. Hmm, the options are A) 5.02e-16, B)4.06e-15, C)5.02e-15, D)4.06e-16. So, my calculation isn't matching any. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me check my steps again.\n\nFirst, calculation of \u03c4: 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That seems right.\n\nCalculating beta: p c is 7.91 GeV, E is 8 GeV, so beta is 7.91/8 = 0.98875. So v is 0.98875c. Correct.\n\nThen, v is 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by \u03c4: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.108e-16 m.\n\nHmm, but that's not matching any options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating p.\n\nWait, let's recalculate p.\n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So,\n\n(pc)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.\n\nSo, pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV. Let me compute sqrt(62.56). Hmm, 7.9^2 = 62.41, 7.91^2=62.5681. So yes, pc=7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should use natural units where c=1, but when converting to velocity, I have to remember to multiply by c.\n\nWait, another thought. Maybe I should compute the lifetime differently. Oh, wait, no, the formula \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 is correct, I think.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me think again. Beta is p c / E, which is (7.91 GeV)/(8 GeV) = 0.98875. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use gamma instead. Gamma is E/(m c^2) = 8/(1.2) = 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.\n\nThen, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nSo, 1/gamma^2 is 1/(44.444) \u2248 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. Which matches the previous beta. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so my calculation of L is about 6.1e-16 meters. But the options are all lower than that. Wait, the options are 4e-15, 5e-15, 4e-16, 5e-16.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width. Oh wait, the width is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So that's correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I should calculate the mean decay length using the total decay width, but sometimes the width is given as the total width, which is the same as the decay rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the decay length is L = c * \u03c4 * beta. Which is what I did.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the product. Let me compute 2.966e8 m/s multiplied by 2.056875e-24 s.\n\n2.966e8 is 2.966 * 1e8 = 2.966 * 10^8.\n\n2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 * 10^-24.\n\nMultiplying them: 2.966 * 2.056875 = let's compute that.\n\n2.966 * 2 = 5.932.\n\n2.966 * 0.056875 = Let's see:\n\n0.056875 is approximately 0.056875.\n\n2.966 * 0.05 is 0.1483.\n\n2.966 * 0.006875 = approximately 0.02036.\n\nAdding, 0.1483 + 0.02036 = 0.16866.\n\nSo total is 5.932 + 0.16866 = 6.10066.\n\nSo, 6.10066e(8-24) = 6.10066e-16 meters. So about 6.1e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but none of the options are near that. The closest is option A:5.02e-16, and option D:4.06e-16. So why am I getting a value higher than the options?\n\nHmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of the lifetime? Let me check that.\n\nWait, the formula for lifetime is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But \u0393 is the total decay width. Wait, but I think I used the correct value, 0.32 GeV.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the natural unit system where \u0127 = 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm. Maybe I should recompute using that.\n\nWait, let's try this approach. Let's compute the lifetime using \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut \u0127 in MeV\u00b7fm is 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm. \u0393 is 320 MeV.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm) / (320 MeV) )= (197.33 / 320) fm.\n\n197.33 / 320 is approximately 0.61665 fm. 1 fm is 1e-15 m. So, \u03c4 \u2248 0.61665e-15 seconds. Wait, no, that's the lifetime in fm/c units? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps using natural units where c=1, so tau would be in units of fm, but I need to convert it into seconds.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The unit of \u0127 is MeV\u00b7fm. So, tau = \u0127/(\u0393) \u2192 units are (MeV\u00b7fm) / (MeV) ) = fm. So tau is 0.61665 fm. 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so tau is 0.61665e-15 m? No, wait, no. Because tau is a time, so 1 fm is 1e-15 m, but time is in seconds. So I must convert fm into seconds.\n\nWait, 1 fm is 1e-15 m, and speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So, 1 fm = c * (1e-15 s) \u2192 time in fm is (distance in fm) / c.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute tau in seconds.\n\nWait, Planck's constant \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, using that, tau = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Which is what I did earlier.\n\nSo, tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's correct.\n\nNow, the velocity is 0.98875c, so about 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nSo, L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCalculating that again: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.966 * 2.056875 * 1e-16.\n\n2.966 * 2.056875 \u2248 6.104.\n\nSo, 6.104e-16 meters. So, approximately 6.1e-16 m.\n\nBut none of the options are close to that. So maybe I made a mistake in beta.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should compute beta using the relativistic relation E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2.\n\nWait, beta is (pc)/(E) \u2192 p c = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4) \u2192 so beta = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)).\n\nWait, but in natural units where c=1 and E and m are in GeV, beta = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2)/(E\u00b2)).\n\nSo, m is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV.\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay length because the production energy is higher than the mass, so the meson is moving relativistically. So the mean decay length is L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nWait, gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 since E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, gamma = 8 /1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nSo, beta gamma = beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 \u2248 6.578.\n\nWait, but then L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nWait, but earlier I used L = beta c tau. Wait, because L = v * tau = (beta c) * tau = beta c tau.\n\nBut I think I should have included gamma as well. Because in terms of proper time, tau is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame, but when you observe it in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau.\n\nWait, wait, no. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So, the mean lifetime is longer by gamma. So, the decay length is L = v * gamma tau.\n\nWait, that's a critical point. I think I missed the gamma factor earlier. Oh no! That's where I went wrong.\n\nSo, the correct formula is L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nBecause the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, and velocity is beta c. So, L = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nAh! So I forgot to multiply by gamma, which is about 6.6667.\n\nSo let me recalculate.\n\nGamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.\n\nBeta is 0.98875.\n\nSo, beta gamma = 0.98875 * 6.6667 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n6.6667 * 0.98875 \u2192 6.6667 * 0.98875.\n\nLet me compute 6 * 0.98875 = 5.9325.\n\n0.6667 * 0.98875 \u2248 0.6667 * 1 is 0.6667, minus 0.6667 * 0.01125 \u2192 approximately 0.6667 - 0.0075 = 0.6592.\n\nSo total is 5.9325 + 0.6592 = 6.5917. So beta gamma \u22486.5917.\n\nSo, L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo, L = 6.5917 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, multiply 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 \u2192 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen multiply by 6.5917:\n\n6.5917 * 6.170625e-16 \u2192 let's compute 6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.5917 *6.170625e-16 \u2248 approximately 3.647e-16.\n\nAdding, 3.702375e-15 + 3.647e-16 = 4.067e-15 meters.\n\nWait, that's approximately 4.067e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close.\n\nSo, the correct answer must be option B: 4.0655 *10^-15 m.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculation.\n\nWait, 6.5917 * (3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s) \u2192 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 6.5917:\n\n6.5917 * 6.170625e-16 = Let's compute 6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.5917 *6.170625e-16 \u2192 0.5917 *6.170625 = 3.647e0 \u2192 3.647e0 *1e-16 = 3.647e-16.\n\nSo, 3.702375e-15 + 3.647e-16 = 3.702375e-15 + 0.3647e-15 = 4.067075e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.067e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close, considering rounding in intermediate steps.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.\n\nThe question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. So, I'm dealing with very tiny distances, which makes sense for particles decaying quickly.\n\nWait, mesons are bosons, right? And they have a short lifetime, which would mean a small decay distance. But how do I calculate that?\n\nI remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula I think is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393, where \u0393 is the decay width. Oh, but wait, \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 is in units of GeV\u00b7s or something like that. I need to make sure the units match.\n\nLet me jot down the constants. Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7seconds. Oh, right, because \u0127 is about 197 MeV\u00b7fm, but converting that into GeV and seconds might be better here.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, \u0393 is given in MeV. Let's convert \u0393 into GeV. \u0393_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 seconds. Let me calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So, 20.56875e-25 seconds. Which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's the lifetime.\n\nNow, the decay distance is the mean lifetime multiplied by the velocity of the particle. So, I need to find the velocity. But how?\n\nThe velocity can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X, and its mass is m_X, I can find its momentum and then its velocity.\n\nThe energy E is given by E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2. Let me solve for p.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So, E\u00b2 = (8)^2 = 64 (GeV)^2. m\u00b2c^4 is (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2. So, (pc)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So, pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV. What's the square root of 62.56? Let me see, 7.91 squared is 62.56, because 7.9^2 is 62.41, 7.91^2 is 62.5681, which is close enough. So, pc \u2248 7.91 GeV. Therefore, p = 7.91 GeV / c.\n\nWait, but I need the velocity v. The velocity can be found from the relation p = gamma m v. Or perhaps using beta (\u03b2 = v/c) in terms of momentum and energy.\n\nAnother approach: beta (\u03b2) is p c / E. Because p c is in units of GeV when E is in GeV.\n\nSo, beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) ) = 7.91 / 8 \u2248 0.98875. So, v is approximately 0.98875 c.\n\nSo, the velocity is about 0.98875 times the speed of light. Now, the speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. So, v \u2248 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance is L = v * \u03c4. So, let's compute that.\n\nWe have \u03c4 as 2.056875e-24 seconds. Multiply by v.\n\nL = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = let's compute that.\n\n2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (6.108) * 1e-16 m. So, approximately 6.108e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but none of the options are near 6e-16. Hmm, the options are A) 5.02e-16, B)4.06e-15, C)5.02e-15, D)4.06e-16. So, my calculation isn't matching any. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me check my steps again.\n\nFirst, calculation of \u03c4: 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That seems right.\n\nCalculating beta: p c is 7.91 GeV, E is 8 GeV, so beta is 7.91/8 = 0.98875. So v is 0.98875c. Correct.\n\nThen, v is 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by \u03c4: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.108e-16 m.\n\nHmm, but that's not matching any options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating p.\n\nWait, let's recalculate p.\n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So,\n\n(pc)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.\n\nSo, pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV. Let me compute sqrt(62.56). Hmm, 7.9^2 = 62.41, 7.91^2=62.5681. So yes, pc=7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should use natural units where c=1, but when converting to velocity, I have to remember to multiply by c.\n\nWait, another thought. Maybe I should compute the lifetime differently. Oh, wait, no, the formula \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 is correct, I think.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me think again. Beta is p c / E, which is (7.91 GeV)/(8 GeV) = 0.98875. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use gamma instead. Gamma is E/(m c^2) = 8/(1.2) = 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.\n\nThen, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nSo, 1/gamma^2 is 1/(44.444) \u2248 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. Which matches the previous beta. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so my calculation of L is about 6.1e-16 meters. But the options are all lower than that. Wait, the options are 4e-15, 5e-15, 4e-16, 5e-16.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width. Oh wait, the width is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So that's correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I should calculate the mean decay length using the total decay width, but sometimes the width is given as the total width, which is the same as the decay rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the decay length is L = c * \u03c4 * beta. Which is what I did.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the product. Let me compute 2.966e8 m/s multiplied by 2.056875e-24 s.\n\n2.966e8 is 2.966 * 1e8 = 2.966 * 10^8.\n\n2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 * 10^-24.\n\nMultiplying them: 2.966 * 2.056875 = let's compute that.\n\n2.966 * 2 = 5.932.\n\n2.966 * 0.056875 = Let's see:\n\n0.056875 is approximately 0.056875.\n\n2.966 * 0.05 is 0.1483.\n\n2.966 * 0.006875 = approximately 0.02036.\n\nAdding, 0.1483 + 0.02036 = 0.16866.\n\nSo total is 5.932 + 0.16866 = 6.10066.\n\nSo, 6.10066e(8-24) = 6.10066e-16 meters. So about 6.1e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but none of the options are near that. The closest is option A:5.02e-16, and option D:4.06e-16. So why am I getting a value higher than the options?\n\nHmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of the lifetime? Let me check that.\n\nWait, the formula for lifetime is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But \u0393 is the total decay width. Wait, but I think I used the correct value, 0.32 GeV.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the natural unit system where \u0127 = 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm. Maybe I should recompute using that.\n\nWait, let's try this approach. Let's compute the lifetime using \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut \u0127 in MeV\u00b7fm is 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm. \u0393 is 320 MeV.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm) / (320 MeV) )= (197.33 / 320) fm.\n\n197.33 / 320 is approximately 0.61665 fm. 1 fm is 1e-15 m. So, \u03c4 \u2248 0.61665e-15 seconds. Wait, no, that's the lifetime in fm/c units? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps using natural units where c=1, so tau would be in units of fm, but I need to convert it into seconds.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The unit of \u0127 is MeV\u00b7fm. So, tau = \u0127/(\u0393) \u2192 units are (MeV\u00b7fm) / (MeV) ) = fm. So tau is 0.61665 fm. 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so tau is 0.61665e-15 m? No, wait, no. Because tau is a time, so 1 fm is 1e-15 m, but time is in seconds. So I must convert fm into seconds.\n\nWait, 1 fm is 1e-15 m, and speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So, 1 fm = c * (1e-15 s) \u2192 time in fm is (distance in fm) / c.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute tau in seconds.\n\nWait, Planck's constant \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, using that, tau = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Which is what I did earlier.\n\nSo, tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's correct.\n\nNow, the velocity is 0.98875c, so about 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nSo, L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCalculating that again: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.966 * 2.056875 * 1e-16.\n\n2.966 * 2.056875 \u2248 6.104.\n\nSo, 6.104e-16 meters. So, approximately 6.1e-16 m.\n\nBut none of the options are close to that. So maybe I made a mistake in beta.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should compute beta using the relativistic relation E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2.\n\nWait, beta is (pc)/(E) \u2192 p c = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4) \u2192 so beta = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)).\n\nWait, but in natural units where c=1 and E and m are in GeV, beta = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2)/(E\u00b2)).\n\nSo, m is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV.\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay length because the production energy is higher than the mass, so the meson is moving relativistically. So the mean decay length is L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nWait, gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 since E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, gamma = 8 /1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nSo, beta gamma = beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 \u2248 6.578.\n\nWait, but then L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nWait, but earlier I used L = beta c tau. Wait, because L = v * tau = (beta c) * tau = beta c tau.\n\nBut I think I should have included gamma as well. Because in terms of proper time, tau is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame, but when you observe it in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau.\n\nWait, wait, no. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So, the mean lifetime is longer by gamma. So, the decay length is L = v * gamma tau.\n\nWait, that's a critical point. I think I missed the gamma factor earlier. Oh no! That's where I went wrong.\n\nSo, the correct formula is L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nBecause the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, and velocity is beta c. So, L = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nAh! So I forgot to multiply by gamma, which is about 6.6667.\n\nSo let me recalculate.\n\nGamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.\n\nBeta is 0.98875.\n\nSo, beta gamma = 0.98875 * 6.6667 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n6.6667 * 0.98875 \u2192 6.6667 * 0.98875.\n\nLet me compute 6 * 0.98875 = 5.9325.\n\n0.6667 * 0.98875 \u2248 0.6667 * 1 is 0.6667, minus 0.6667 * 0.01125 \u2192 approximately 0.6667 - 0.0075 = 0.6592.\n\nSo total is 5.9325 + 0.6592 = 6.5917. So beta gamma \u22486.5917.\n\nSo, L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo, L = 6.5917 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, multiply 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 \u2192 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen multiply by 6.5917:\n\n6.5917 * 6.170625e-16 \u2192 let's compute 6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.5917 *6.170625e-16 \u2248 approximately 3.647e-16.\n\nAdding, 3.702375e-15 + 3.647e-16 = 4.067e-15 meters.\n\nWait, that's approximately 4.067e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close.\n\nSo, the correct answer must be option B: 4.0655 *10^-15 m.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculation.\n\nWait, 6.5917 * (3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s) \u2192 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 6.5917:\n\n6.5917 * 6.170625e-16 = Let's compute 6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.5917 *6.170625e-16 \u2192 0.5917 *6.170625 = 3.647e0 \u2192 3.647e0 *1e-16 = 3.647e-16.\n\nSo, 3.702375e-15 + 3.647e-16 = 3.702375e-15 + 0.3647e-15 = 4.067075e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.067e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close, considering rounding in intermediate steps.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the mean lifetime (\u03c4):**  \n   The mean lifetime is given by the formula:  \n   \\[\n   \\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\n   \\]  \n   where \\(\\hbar = 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s}\\) and \\(\\Gamma = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV}\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.\n\nThe question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are: production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all on the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. \n\nI remember that particles like mesons can decay, and their mean lifetime is related to their width. The mean lifetime \u03c4 is given by the uncertainty principle, where \u03c4 is inversely proportional to the width \u0393. The formula I think is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, since \u0393 is given in MeV, I need to convert units properly.\n\nWait, but also, the decay distance would be the product of the velocity of the particle and the mean lifetime. So the mean decay distance L = v * \u03c4. That makes sense because the particle travels a certain distance before it decays.\n\nSo first, I'll compute the lifetime \u03c4. Let me get the units right. The reduced Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Since \u0393 is given in MeV, I should convert that to GeV to match the units. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. Plugging in the numbers: 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately (6.582 / 0.32) \u00d7 1e-25. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is about 20.56875. So \u03c4 \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, that seems really small, but I think it's right because particles with higher mass and width have shorter lifetimes. \n\nNext, I need to find the velocity v of the meson. The meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much higher than the rest mass, meaning it's moving relativistically. \n\nThe energy of a relativistic particle is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. The momentum p is \u03b3 m v, and since E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2, perhaps I can find \u03b3 from E and m.\n\nAlternatively, since E is much larger than m, we can approximate E \u2248 pc. Because for high energies, the rest mass is negligible compared to the kinetic energy, so E \u2248 pc \u2192 p \u2248 E/(c). Then, since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and p = \u03b3 m v, we can write v \u2248 (p c)/E. Wait, maybe I should think more carefully.\n\nLet me calculate the Lorentz factor \u03b3. E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2). Since E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, \u03b3 = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667. \n\nSo \u03b3 is about 6.6667. Then, the velocity v can be found from \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let's solve for v. \n\nAlternatively, using the approximation for v when \u03b3 is large: v \u2248 c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)}. But since \u03b3 is 6.6667, which isn't super large but manageable. \n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute \u03b2 = v/c. Since \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2\u00b2), we can rearrange to find \u03b2. \n\nLet me compute \u03b2:\n\n\u03b3 = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03b3\u00b2 = (8/1.2)^2 = (6.6667)^2 \u2248 44.4444.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03b3\u00b2 (1 - \u03b2\u00b2) = 1 \u2192 44.4444 (1 - \u03b2\u00b2) = 1 \u2192 1 - \u03b2\u00b2 = 1/44.4444 \u2248 0.0225 \u2192 \u03b2\u00b2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 \u2192 \u03b2 = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo v \u2248 0.9887 c. That's about 0.9887 times the speed of light.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance L is v * \u03c4. So L = v * \u03c4 = 0.9887 c * \u03c4.\n\nBut wait, let me compute \u03c4 again. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate:\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. \u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo L = 0.9887 * c * \u03c4. c is about 3e8 m/s. So:\n\nL \u2248 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 3e8 m/s multiplied by 2.056875e-24 s is 3 * 2.056875e-16 \u2192 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.110e-16 m.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, that's about 6e-16 meters, but the options are around 4e-15 or 5e-15 m. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, let's double-check the steps.\n\nFirst, calculation of \u03c4:\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.\n\nThen, v \u2248 0.9887 c. So L = v * \u03c4 = 0.9887 c \u03c4.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s. So 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters. Multiply by 0.9887 gives about 6.11e-16 m.\n\nBut the options don't have anything like that. The options are A) 5.02e-16, B)4.06e-15, etc. Hmm. So either I made a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the decay length formula differently. Another approach is using the formula for the mean proper lifetime \u03c4, and then considering the particle's velocity to get the lab frame lifetime. But wait, I think I did that correctly.\n\nWait, another thought: the width \u0393 is related to the mean lifetime by \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. Correct.\n\nWait, but another possibility: perhaps I should compute the velocity using the relativistic relation between energy and momentum.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The energy E is given, and the mass m is given. So the momentum p can be found using E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. Let me compute p.\n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 \u2192 (pc)^2 = E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2.\n\nBut since E and m are in GeV, and c is in m/s, perhaps I should convert units carefully.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute \u03b2 using E and m.\n\nThe energy E is the total energy, so E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. The momentum p = \u03b3 m v. So, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). Alternatively, I can write E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and p = \u03b3 m v.\n\nWe can find \u03b2 = v/c = p c / E.\n\nSo, let's compute p c / E.\n\np c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )\n\nWait, but E and m are in GeV, so I need to be careful about units. Let's convert them to the same units, perhaps to eV.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute p c in units where c=1. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, let's compute p c as sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2). So, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So, (m c^2) is 1.2 GeV. So (m c\u00b2)^2 is (1.2)^2 (GeV)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2.\n\nE^2 is 64 (GeV)^2. So p c = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV = sqrt(62.56) GeV \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo p c \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo \u03b2 = (p c) / E = 7.91 / 8 \u2248 0.98875. So \u03b2 is about 0.98875, which matches what I found earlier. So v \u2248 0.98875 c. So that part is correct.\n\nSo the calculation of L = v \u03c4 is correct, but the result is about 6.1e-16 m, which doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of \u03c4.\n\nWait, let me recalculate \u03c4. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. \u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u03c4 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute that more accurately. 6.582 divided by 0.32.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = let me compute 6.582 / 0.32.\n\n0.32 * 20 = 6.4 \u2192 6.582 - 6.4 = 0.182. So 20 + (0.182 / 0.32) \u2192 0.182 /0.32 \u2248 0.56875. So total is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s \u2192 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.\n\nSo L = v \u03c4 = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCalculating 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m. Multiply by 0.98875: 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875 \u2248 6.11e-16 m.\n\nHmm, but none of the options match that. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nSo my calculation gives approximately 6.1e-16 m, but the closest option is A) 5.02e-16 m. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the decay length formula more precisely. The mean decay length is given by L = c\u03c4 \u03b2 \u03b3, because the mean lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4, and the velocity is \u03b2 c. So L = \u03b2 \u03b3 c \u03c4.\n\nWait, that's another formula I've heard of. Let me think. The mean proper lifetime is \u03c4, so the lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4. So the decay length is L = v * (\u03b3 \u03c4) = \u03b2 c * \u03b3 \u03c4 = \u03b2 \u03b3 c \u03c4.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake by not including the \u03b3 factor earlier.\n\nOh wait, I think I did include the \u03b3 in a way. Because earlier, when I computed \u03c4, that was the proper lifetime. So the lab frame lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4. So the decay length is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is \u03b2 c * \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nWait, earlier I used \u03c4 as the proper lifetime, and then multiplied by v, which is \u03b2 c. So perhaps I should have used L = v * \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The proper lifetime is \u03c4. The lab frame sees the particle's lifetime as \u03b3 \u03c4. The distance it travels is velocity times lifetime in the lab frame. So L = v * \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nSo v is \u03b2 c. So L = \u03b2 c * \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nSo perhaps I should have used this formula.\n\nSo let me recalculate using this approach.\n\nFirst, compute \u03b3: E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2 \u2192 \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). But since E and m are in GeV, and c is in m/s, perhaps I should compute it in terms of energy units.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute \u03b3 as E/(m). Because if E and m are both in GeV, then E/(m) gives \u03b3, since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and when E and m are in GeV, and c\u00b2 is in (m/s)^2, but perhaps it's easier to ignore the units for this ratio.\n\nSo \u03b3 = E/m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667.\n\nSo \u03b3 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nThen, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L = \u03b2 \u03b3 c \u03c4.\n\nWait, but \u03b2 is 0.98875, \u03b3 is 6.6667.\n\nSo L = 0.98875 * 6.6667 * c * \u03c4.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u03c4 is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo c * \u03c4 = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen multiply by \u03b2 \u03b3: 0.98875 * 6.6667 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\n0.98875 * 6.6667 \u2192 approximately 6.6 (since 0.98875 is almost 1, so 6.6667 * 0.98875 \u2248 6.5944).\n\nSo 6.5944 * 6.170625e-16 m \u2192 6.5944 * 6.170625 \u2248 40.546e-16 m \u2192 4.0546e-15 m.\n\nHmm, that's about 4.05e-15 meters, which matches option B) 4.0655 *10^-15 m.\n\nWait, but let me compute 0.98875 * 6.6666667 more accurately.\n\n6.6666667 * 0.98875 = ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n6.6666667 * 0.98875 = 6.6666667 * (1 - 0.01125) = 6.6666667 - (6.6666667 * 0.01125).\n\nCompute 6.6666667 * 0.01125:\n\n0.01125 is 1/88, but perhaps it's easier to calculate:\n\n6.6666667 * 0.01 = 0.066666667.\n\n6.6666667 * 0.00125 = 0.0083333334.\n\nSo total 0.066666667 + 0.0083333334 \u2248 0.075.\n\nSo 6.6666667 - 0.075 = 6.5916667.\n\nSo 6.5916667.\n\nSo L = 6.5916667 * 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nCompute 6.5916667 * 6.170625.\n\n6 * 6.170625 = 37.02375.\n\n0.5916667 * 6.170625 \u2248 approx 3.641.\n\nSo total is approximately 37.02375 + 3.641 \u2248 40.66475.\n\nSo 40.66475e-16 m = 4.066475e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.066e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.\n\nThe question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are: production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all on the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. \n\nI remember that particles like mesons can decay, and their mean lifetime is related to their width. The mean lifetime \u03c4 is given by the uncertainty principle, where \u03c4 is inversely proportional to the width \u0393. The formula I think is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, since \u0393 is given in MeV, I need to convert units properly.\n\nWait, but also, the decay distance would be the product of the velocity of the particle and the mean lifetime. So the mean decay distance L = v * \u03c4. That makes sense because the particle travels a certain distance before it decays.\n\nSo first, I'll compute the lifetime \u03c4. Let me get the units right. The reduced Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Since \u0393 is given in MeV, I should convert that to GeV to match the units. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. Plugging in the numbers: 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately (6.582 / 0.32) \u00d7 1e-25. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is about 20.56875. So \u03c4 \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, that seems really small, but I think it's right because particles with higher mass and width have shorter lifetimes. \n\nNext, I need to find the velocity v of the meson. The meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much higher than the rest mass, meaning it's moving relativistically. \n\nThe energy of a relativistic particle is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. The momentum p is \u03b3 m v, and since E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2, perhaps I can find \u03b3 from E and m.\n\nAlternatively, since E is much larger than m, we can approximate E \u2248 pc. Because for high energies, the rest mass is negligible compared to the kinetic energy, so E \u2248 pc \u2192 p \u2248 E/(c). Then, since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and p = \u03b3 m v, we can write v \u2248 (p c)/E. Wait, maybe I should think more carefully.\n\nLet me calculate the Lorentz factor \u03b3. E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2). Since E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, \u03b3 = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667. \n\nSo \u03b3 is about 6.6667. Then, the velocity v can be found from \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let's solve for v. \n\nAlternatively, using the approximation for v when \u03b3 is large: v \u2248 c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)}. But since \u03b3 is 6.6667, which isn't super large but manageable. \n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute \u03b2 = v/c. Since \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2\u00b2), we can rearrange to find \u03b2. \n\nLet me compute \u03b2:\n\n\u03b3 = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03b3\u00b2 = (8/1.2)^2 = (6.6667)^2 \u2248 44.4444.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03b3\u00b2 (1 - \u03b2\u00b2) = 1 \u2192 44.4444 (1 - \u03b2\u00b2) = 1 \u2192 1 - \u03b2\u00b2 = 1/44.4444 \u2248 0.0225 \u2192 \u03b2\u00b2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 \u2192 \u03b2 = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo v \u2248 0.9887 c. That's about 0.9887 times the speed of light.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance L is v * \u03c4. So L = v * \u03c4 = 0.9887 c * \u03c4.\n\nBut wait, let me compute \u03c4 again. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate:\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. \u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo L = 0.9887 * c * \u03c4. c is about 3e8 m/s. So:\n\nL \u2248 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 3e8 m/s multiplied by 2.056875e-24 s is 3 * 2.056875e-16 \u2192 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.110e-16 m.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, that's about 6e-16 meters, but the options are around 4e-15 or 5e-15 m. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, let's double-check the steps.\n\nFirst, calculation of \u03c4:\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.\n\nThen, v \u2248 0.9887 c. So L = v * \u03c4 = 0.9887 c \u03c4.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s. So 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters. Multiply by 0.9887 gives about 6.11e-16 m.\n\nBut the options don't have anything like that. The options are A) 5.02e-16, B)4.06e-15, etc. Hmm. So either I made a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the decay length formula differently. Another approach is using the formula for the mean proper lifetime \u03c4, and then considering the particle's velocity to get the lab frame lifetime. But wait, I think I did that correctly.\n\nWait, another thought: the width \u0393 is related to the mean lifetime by \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. Correct.\n\nWait, but another possibility: perhaps I should compute the velocity using the relativistic relation between energy and momentum.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The energy E is given, and the mass m is given. So the momentum p can be found using E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. Let me compute p.\n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 \u2192 (pc)^2 = E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2.\n\nBut since E and m are in GeV, and c is in m/s, perhaps I should convert units carefully.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute \u03b2 using E and m.\n\nThe energy E is the total energy, so E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. The momentum p = \u03b3 m v. So, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). Alternatively, I can write E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and p = \u03b3 m v.\n\nWe can find \u03b2 = v/c = p c / E.\n\nSo, let's compute p c / E.\n\np c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )\n\nWait, but E and m are in GeV, so I need to be careful about units. Let's convert them to the same units, perhaps to eV.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute p c in units where c=1. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, let's compute p c as sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2). So, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So, (m c^2) is 1.2 GeV. So (m c\u00b2)^2 is (1.2)^2 (GeV)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2.\n\nE^2 is 64 (GeV)^2. So p c = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV = sqrt(62.56) GeV \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo p c \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo \u03b2 = (p c) / E = 7.91 / 8 \u2248 0.98875. So \u03b2 is about 0.98875, which matches what I found earlier. So v \u2248 0.98875 c. So that part is correct.\n\nSo the calculation of L = v \u03c4 is correct, but the result is about 6.1e-16 m, which doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of \u03c4.\n\nWait, let me recalculate \u03c4. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. \u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u03c4 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute that more accurately. 6.582 divided by 0.32.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = let me compute 6.582 / 0.32.\n\n0.32 * 20 = 6.4 \u2192 6.582 - 6.4 = 0.182. So 20 + (0.182 / 0.32) \u2192 0.182 /0.32 \u2248 0.56875. So total is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s \u2192 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.\n\nSo L = v \u03c4 = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCalculating 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m. Multiply by 0.98875: 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875 \u2248 6.11e-16 m.\n\nHmm, but none of the options match that. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nSo my calculation gives approximately 6.1e-16 m, but the closest option is A) 5.02e-16 m. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the decay length formula more precisely. The mean decay length is given by L = c\u03c4 \u03b2 \u03b3, because the mean lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4, and the velocity is \u03b2 c. So L = \u03b2 \u03b3 c \u03c4.\n\nWait, that's another formula I've heard of. Let me think. The mean proper lifetime is \u03c4, so the lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4. So the decay length is L = v * (\u03b3 \u03c4) = \u03b2 c * \u03b3 \u03c4 = \u03b2 \u03b3 c \u03c4.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake by not including the \u03b3 factor earlier.\n\nOh wait, I think I did include the \u03b3 in a way. Because earlier, when I computed \u03c4, that was the proper lifetime. So the lab frame lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4. So the decay length is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is \u03b2 c * \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nWait, earlier I used \u03c4 as the proper lifetime, and then multiplied by v, which is \u03b2 c. So perhaps I should have used L = v * \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The proper lifetime is \u03c4. The lab frame sees the particle's lifetime as \u03b3 \u03c4. The distance it travels is velocity times lifetime in the lab frame. So L = v * \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nSo v is \u03b2 c. So L = \u03b2 c * \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nSo perhaps I should have used this formula.\n\nSo let me recalculate using this approach.\n\nFirst, compute \u03b3: E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2 \u2192 \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). But since E and m are in GeV, and c is in m/s, perhaps I should compute it in terms of energy units.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute \u03b3 as E/(m). Because if E and m are both in GeV, then E/(m) gives \u03b3, since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and when E and m are in GeV, and c\u00b2 is in (m/s)^2, but perhaps it's easier to ignore the units for this ratio.\n\nSo \u03b3 = E/m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667.\n\nSo \u03b3 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nThen, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L = \u03b2 \u03b3 c \u03c4.\n\nWait, but \u03b2 is 0.98875, \u03b3 is 6.6667.\n\nSo L = 0.98875 * 6.6667 * c * \u03c4.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u03c4 is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo c * \u03c4 = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen multiply by \u03b2 \u03b3: 0.98875 * 6.6667 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\n0.98875 * 6.6667 \u2192 approximately 6.6 (since 0.98875 is almost 1, so 6.6667 * 0.98875 \u2248 6.5944).\n\nSo 6.5944 * 6.170625e-16 m \u2192 6.5944 * 6.170625 \u2248 40.546e-16 m \u2192 4.0546e-15 m.\n\nHmm, that's about 4.05e-15 meters, which matches option B) 4.0655 *10^-15 m.\n\nWait, but let me compute 0.98875 * 6.6666667 more accurately.\n\n6.6666667 * 0.98875 = ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n6.6666667 * 0.98875 = 6.6666667 * (1 - 0.01125) = 6.6666667 - (6.6666667 * 0.01125).\n\nCompute 6.6666667 * 0.01125:\n\n0.01125 is 1/88, but perhaps it's easier to calculate:\n\n6.6666667 * 0.01 = 0.066666667.\n\n6.6666667 * 0.00125 = 0.0083333334.\n\nSo total 0.066666667 + 0.0083333334 \u2248 0.075.\n\nSo 6.6666667 - 0.075 = 6.5916667.\n\nSo 6.5916667.\n\nSo L = 6.5916667 * 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nCompute 6.5916667 * 6.170625.\n\n6 * 6.170625 = 37.02375.\n\n0.5916667 * 6.170625 \u2248 approx 3.641.\n\nSo total is approximately 37.02375 + 3.641 \u2248 40.66475.\n\nSo 40.66475e-16 m = 4.066475e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.066e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the formula for the decay length:\n\n\\[\nL = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\beta = v/c \\) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,\n- \\( \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} \\) is the Lorentz factor,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light,\n- \\( \\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} \\) is the mean proper lifetime, and\n- \\( \\Gamma \\) is the width of the particle.\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( \\tau \\)\nThe reduced Planck constant is \\( \\hbar = 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s} \\), and the width is \\( \\Gamma = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about meson resonance and decay distance. I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonance... I think that has something to do with particles that don't exist long enough to be observed directly, so they're kind of like virtual particles.\n\nThe question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are given, so I guess I have to calculate it and see which one matches.\n\nWait, what's the formula for the mean decay distance? I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. So for a particle, the lifetime \u03c4 is approximately \u0127 divided by the width \u0393. Because \u0393 is the energy width, which is related to the uncertainty in energy, and \u03c4 would be the uncertainty in time.\n\nSo \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, I think the actual formula is \u03c4 = \u0127 / (\u0393/2), because the width \u0393 is the total decay width, and the uncertainty in energy is \u0393. So \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393), or maybe \u0127/(2\u0393)? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. I think the correct formula is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. Because \u0393 is the total decay width, which is the energy uncertainty, and the time uncertainty is \u0127 over that. Yeah, I'll go with \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nOnce I have the lifetime \u03c4, the mean decay distance is the speed of the particle multiplied by \u03c4. But wait, the particle is moving at relativistic speeds. So I can't just use the speed from non-relativistic mechanics. I need to calculate the relativistic velocity. Alternatively, since the particle's lifetime is dilated due to its high speed, maybe I should compute the proper lifetime and then multiply by velocity and Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, no, the mean lifetime \u03c4 is already the dilated lifetime. Because in particle physics, the lifetime given is usually the proper lifetime multiplied by the Lorentz factor \u03b3. So when I calculate the mean decay distance, it's v * \u03c4, since \u03c4 is the time experienced in the lab frame.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider the velocity as a function of the particle's energy. Because E is given as 8 GeV, which is much larger than the rest mass of 1.2 GeV. So the particle is ultra-relativistic, meaning v is approximately the speed of light c. So for calculation purposes, v \u2248 c = 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo putting it together, the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the mean lifetime \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n2. Multiply \u03c4 by the speed v (approx c) to get the mean decay distance.\n\nWait, but \u0393 is given in MeV. Oh right, I need to make sure the units are consistent. \u0127 has units of GeV\u00b7s or something like that? Let me check the value of \u0127 in units that match.\n\nI remember that \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So that's a useful number here. Because \u0393 is given in GeV, so when I divide \u0127 by \u0393 (in GeV), I'll get seconds.\n\nSo let's plug in the numbers. \u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s.\n\nCalculating that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, let me do that division properly. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance L is v * \u03c4. Since v \u2248 c, L \u2248 c * \u03c4.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s. So L = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?\n\nMultiplying those together: 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nWait, that's 6.17e-16 meters. But looking at the options, the closest is option A) 5.0223e-16 m or option D) 4.0655e-16 m. Hmm, none match 6e-16.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the units for \u0127. Let me confirm. \u0127 is 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. That's correct.\n\nWait, but the mass is 1.2 GeV, which is probably the rest mass. But in the decay, does the energy matter? Oh wait, in the problem statement, production energy is 8 GeV. Hmm, but for decay width, I think the energy is related to the mass. Wait, no, the width is a property of the particle, so it should be independent of the production energy. So perhaps the production energy is a red herring, or maybe it's needed for something else.\n\nWait, no, wait. The mean decay length depends on the velocity of the particle. So if the particle is moving at a high energy, its velocity is high. But earlier, I assumed v \u2248 c. But perhaps I should compute the velocity more accurately, using the energy.\n\nSo, the energy E is 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV. The energy of a relativistic particle is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). Wait, but E is given in GeV, and m is in GeV/c\u00b2. So when we write E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, in units where c=1, it's E = \u03b3 m. So \u03b3 = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So \u03b3 is approximately 6.6667.\n\nNow, \u03b2 = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). Since \u03b3 is large, \u03b2 is approximately 1. Let's compute it precisely. So 1/\u03b3\u00b2 is 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So \u03b2 \u2248 0.9887, so v \u2248 0.9887 c.\n\nSo L = v \u03c4 = \u03b2 c \u03c4.\n\nWait, earlier I calculated \u03c4 as 2.056875e-24 seconds. So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.056875e-24 s:\n\n2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?\n\nLet me compute 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.966 * 2.056875 * 1e8-24 = (about 6.115) * 1e-16.\n\nSo 6.115e-16 meters. That's approximately 6.1e-16 m.\n\nBut the options are A:5.02e-16, C:5.02e-15, B:4.06e-15, D:4.06e-16.\n\nHmm, my calculation is 6e-16, but none of the options match that. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of \u03c4. Let me recalculate \u03c4.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\n\u0127 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\n\u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute that precisely.\n\n6.582 divided by 0.32 equals: 6.582 / 0.32.\n\n0.32 * 20 = 6.4, which is less than 6.582. 20 * 0.32 = 6.4. 6.582 -6.4= 0.182. So 0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875.\n\nSo 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 GeV\u00b7s / GeV = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That part was correct.\n\nSo L = \u03b2 c \u03c4 = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3 * 2.056875e-16 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nThen multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 ?\n\n6.170625 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.108.\n\nSo 6.108e-16 meters. Still, none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Oh, wait! Because the particle is a resonance, it's off-shell, meaning it's not a stable particle. But when calculating decay length, perhaps I should use the mean lifetime of the particle, which is related to the width.\n\nWait, another thought: The mean lifetime \u03c4 is \u0127/(\u0393). But sometimes, people use the total decay width \u0393 and the natural line width formula, which is \u0393 = \u0127/\u03c4. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nWait, that's correct. So maybe the calculation is right.\n\nBut the options are lower. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the particle's velocity is not exactly c but less, but earlier calculation gave v about 0.9887 c. But that only reduces the distance from 6.1e-16 to about 6e-16, but the options are lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the energy. Wait, the production energy is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is 8 GeV minus rest mass energy (which is 1.2 GeV). So the kinetic energy is 6.8 GeV. But in relativistic terms, E = gamma m c^2. So gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667, which is what I did before. So that's correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the mean decay distance is calculated using the velocity of the particle, which is found from its energy. Let me think about that again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mean decay distance is given by L = c * tau * (1 - beta), but I don't think that's right. Or maybe L = gamma * beta * c * tau, but wait, tau is already multiplied by gamma. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So perhaps I was correct earlier.\n\nWait, another approach: The mean decay length is given by L = (v * gamma) * (c tau_0), where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. Wait, no, I think I'm getting mixed up.\n\nProper lifetime tau_0 is related to tau by tau = gamma tau_0. So tau_0 = tau / gamma.\n\nSo the mean decay length is v * tau_0 = v * (tau / gamma).\n\nWait, but v is beta c, so v * tau_0 = beta c * tau / gamma.\n\nBut tau is \u0127/(\u0393). So L = beta c * ( \u0127/(\u0393) ) / gamma.\n\nBut since gamma is E/(m c^2) = (8 GeV)/(1.2 GeV) ) = 6.6667.\n\nWait, let's compute this.\n\nL = (beta c) * ( \u0127/(\u0393) ) / gamma.\n\nBeta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 - (1/ (8/1.2)^2 )) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nGamma is 6.6667.\n\nSo L = (0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ) * (6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV ) / 6.6667.\n\nWait, let's compute each part.\n\nFirst, (6.582e-25 / 0.32) is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo,\n\n(0.9887 * 3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) / 6.6667.\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: 0.9887 *3e8 = 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.11e-16 m.\n\nNow divide by 6.6667: 6.11e-16 / 6.6667 \u2248 0.916e-16 = 9.16e-17 m. That's way smaller than before. But this doesn't make sense because earlier, I thought the decay length was 6e-16 m. So this approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the proper lifetime and the dilated lifetime. Let me think again.\n\nThe mean decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0. So the decay length is v * tau = v gamma tau_0.\n\nBut tau_0 is the proper lifetime, which is tau_0 = \u0127/(Gamma). So L = v gamma tau_0 = beta c gamma * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nBut beta gamma is gamma beta, which is (gamma) * (v/c) = (E/mc\u00b2) * (v/c). Hmm, but in any case, I think the correct approach is to use L = v * tau, where tau is the lifetime in the lab frame. Because tau already accounts for the time dilation. So earlier calculation of L \u2248 6.1e-16 m is correct.\n\nBut none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the width is given in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV, but wait, maybe I should convert it to the same units as \u0127. Let me check:\n\nNo, I think I did that correctly. Because \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s, and \u0393 is 0.32 GeV, so when I divide, the GeV cancels.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the possible mistakes.\n\nWait, perhaps the width is given as the natural width, which is 2\u0393. Because sometimes, the width is given as \u0393, but the actual line width is 2\u0393. Wait, no, I think that in particle physics, the width \u0393 is the total decay width, and the lifetime is \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the natural line width formula, where \u0393 = \u0127/tau. So tau = \u0127/\u0393. That's what I did earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the production energy affects the calculation. But the decay width is a property of the particle, so it should be independent of the production energy. So perhaps the production energy isn't needed for calculating the decay length. Hmm. So why is it given?\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the velocity using the production energy and the rest mass.\n\nWait, production energy E is 8 GeV, which is the total energy of the particle. So E = gamma m c^2. So gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) ) = 6.6667.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo v = beta c \u2248 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo using E, I correctly found beta and v.\n\nHmm, perhaps the error is that I should have used the natural unit conversion factors correctly. Let me check the value of \u0127 in units of GeV\u00b7s.\n\nYes, \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, all calculations look correct, but the result is 6.1e-16 m, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the mean decay length is not v * tau, but (v * gamma) * (tau_0), where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. But then tau_0 is \u0127 / Gamma, so L = v gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma ).\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\nv gamma = beta c gamma. Since beta gamma = gamma * v/c.\n\nBeta gamma is (gamma) * (v/c) = (gamma) * (sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) )\n\nWhich is approximately sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, gamma is 6.6667, so beta gamma = 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.583.\n\nSo L = beta gamma * c * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo beta gamma is approx 6.583.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo L = 6.583 * 3e8 m/s * (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV )\n\nCompute denominator: 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, compute numerator: 6.583 *3e8 *6.582e-25 = ?\n\nFirst, 6.583 *3e8 = 1.9749e9.\n\n1.9749e9 *6.582e-25 = (1.9749 *6.582) * 1e-16.\n\n1.9749 *6.582 \u2248 13.007.\n\nSo 13.007e-16 m.\n\nThen divide by 0.32 GeV: 13.007e-16 /0.32 = 40.646e-16 = 4.0646e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's 4.0646e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So that would be option B.\n\nWait, but why did this approach give a different result?\n\nAh, because when I used L = v * tau, I took tau as the dilated lifetime. But perhaps I should have used the proper lifetime. Let me clarify.\n\nThe mean lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0.\n\nThe proper lifetime tau_0 is tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nThe mean decay length is L = v tau = v gamma tau_0.\n\nWhich is the same as v gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo, L = (beta c gamma) * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is the same as beta gamma c * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is what I computed earlier.\n\nSo, according to this, L is about 4.064e-15 m, which matches option B.\n\nSo why did the initial approach give a different answer?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering that the velocity was used correctly. Let me see:\n\nIn the initial approach, I said L = v * tau.\n\nBut tau is the dilated lifetime, which is gamma tau_0.\n\nSo L = v * gamma tau_0.\n\nWhich is the same as beta c gamma tau_0.\n\nWhich is the same as beta gamma c * tau_0.\n\nBut tau_0 is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo L = beta gamma c * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is exactly what I did in the second approach, leading to 4.06e-15 m.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated L as v * tau, I used v as approximately c and tau as \u0127/(Gamma), which gave me 6e-16 m, which was incorrect.\n\nAh, so I think I messed up the initial approach because I didn't account for the fact that tau is already the dilated lifetime. So when I use v * tau, it's correct, but I have to ensure that the tau is the correct one.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I had:\n\ntau = \u0127 / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nThen L = v * tau = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWhich gave me 6.1e-16 m.\n\nBut according to the second approach, the correct way is L = beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma ), which gave me 4.06e-15 m.\n\nSo why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, because in the first approach, I used tau as the dilated lifetime, but I think I forgot that tau = gamma tau_0, and in the second approach, I used tau_0 = \u0127/Gamma, leading to the correct formula.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe proper lifetime tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nThe lab frame lifetime tau = gamma tau_0.\n\nSo the decay length is L = v tau = v gamma tau_0 = v gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is the same as beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo in the second approach, I correctly used beta gamma c * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nBut in the first approach, I used tau as the dilated lifetime, which is correct, but when I multiplied by v (which is beta c), I think I was correct.\n\nWait, but if I calculate L = v * tau = beta c * gamma tau_0 = beta gamma c tau_0.\n\nWhich is the same as beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo both approaches should give the same result. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, in the first approach:\n\nv = beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L = v * tau = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.\n\n2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.\n\n2.966 * 2.056875 \u2248 6.107.\n\nSo 6.107e-16 m.\n\nBut according to the second approach, I get 4.06e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's a factor of about 6.6 difference. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the second approach.\n\nWait, in the second approach, L = beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nbeta gamma is 6.583.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, 6.583 * 3e8 = 1.9749e9.\n\nMultiply by 6.582e-25: 1.9749e9 *6.582e-25 = 1.3007e-15.\n\nDivide by 0.32: 1.3007e-15 / 0.32 = 4.0646e-15 m.\n\nSo 4.0646e-15 m is option B.\n\nBut according to the first approach, I have 6.107e-16 m, which is 0.61e-15 m, which is about 1/6.6 of the second approach.\n\nSo where's the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps in the second approach, I forgot that tau_0 is \u0127 / (Gamma), but tau is gamma tau_0.\n\nSo L = v tau = v gamma tau_0.\n\nWhich is v gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo, v = beta c.\n\nThus, L = beta c gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nBut in the first approach, I have L = v tau = beta c * (gamma tau_0 ) = beta c gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma ), same as above.\n\nWait, but when I calculated it with the first approach, I got 6.1e-16, and with the second approach, 4.06e-15.\n\nSo that's a factor of 6.6 difference.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.\n\nWait, let's recompute the first approach:\n\nv = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.966e8 m/s.\n\ntau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?\n\nLet me compute 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.966 * 2.056875 * 1e-16.\n\n2.966 * 2.056875 = ?\n\nCalculating 2 *2.056875 =4.11375.\n\n0.966 *2.056875 \u2248 approx 2.000.\n\nSo total about 6.11375.\n\nSo 6.11375e-16 m.\n\nBut according to the second approach, it's 4.0646e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's a discrepancy of about a factor of 6.6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of \u0127. Let me check: \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used the total decay width as \u0393 = 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, but maybe it's given in the natural unit system where \u0127=1, and I'm supposed to adjust the units accordingly. Hmm, no, I think the approach was correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a miscalculation. Let me compute 6.583 *3e8 = ?\n\n6.583 *3e8 = 1.9749e9 m/s.\n\nThen, 1.9749e9 * 6.582e-25 = ?\n\n1.9749e9 *6.582e-25 = 1.9749 *6.582 = approx 13.007.\n\nSo 13.007e-16.\n\nThen, 13.007e-16 / 0.32 = 40.646e-16 = 4.0646e-15 m.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut the first approach gives 6.1e-16 m.\n\nWait, so the same calculation using two different methods gives two different results. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in the first approach, tau is the lab frame lifetime, so when I multiply by v, I get the correct decay length. But why does the second approach give a different result?\n\nAh! I think I see the mistake. In the second approach, I used L = beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma ), but beta gamma is (gamma) * (v/c) = gamma * beta.\n\nWait, but gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) = 8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 6.6667.\n\nBeta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444)) ) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo beta gamma is 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.583.\n\nSo, L = beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is 6.583 *3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV.\n\nWait, let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 6.583 *3e8 = 1.9749e9.\n\nMultiply by 6.582e-25: 1.9749e9 *6.582e-25 = (1.9749 *6.582) *1e-16 = approx 13.007 * 1e-16 = 1.3007e-15.\n\nDivide by 0.32: 1.3007e-15 / 0.32 = 4.0646e-15 m.\n\nBut in the first approach, the calculation was 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.107e-16 m.\n\nSo why the discrepancy? Because the first approach is correct? Or the second?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach. Let's think again.\n\nThe formula for decay length is L = v * tau.\n\nTau is the lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma * tau_0.\n\nTau_0 is the proper lifetime, which is tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo L = v * gamma * tau_0 = beta c * gamma * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is the same as beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is the same as (beta gamma) c ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut in the first approach, I computed L = v * tau, which is beta c * gamma tau_0 = beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is the same as the second approach.\n\nWait, so both approaches should give the same result. But why are they giving different results?\n\nAh! I think I made a mistake in the first approach's calculation. Let me recompute it.\n\nIn the first approach:\n\nv = beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nMultiply 2.966e8 by 2.056875e-24:\n\n2.966e8 = 2.966 * 1e8.\n\n2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 *1e-24.\n\nMultiply 2.966 * 2.056875 = let me compute:\n\n2.966 * 2 = 5.932.\n\n2.966 * 0.056875 \u2248 0.1684.\n\nTotal \u2248 6.1004.\n\nSo 6.1004e8-24 = 6.1004e-16 m.\n\nSo 6.1004e-16 m.\n\nBut according to the second approach, it's 4.0646e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's a factor of ~6.6667 difference. Which is exactly gamma (6.6667).\n\nWait, this suggests that in the first approach, I forgot to multiply by gamma.\n\nWait, no, because tau already includes gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.\n\nWait, tau is the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma * tau_0.\n\nTau_0 is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo tau = gamma * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo L = v * tau = v gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is beta c gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is the same as the second approach.\n\nSo why is the first approach giving me a different answer?\n\nWait, I think I see the mistake. In the first approach, I computed tau as \u0127 / Gamma, which is correct for tau_0, the proper lifetime. But in reality, tau is gamma * tau_0, so tau = gamma * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo when I compute L = v * tau, it's v * gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is the same as the second approach.\n\nSo in the first approach, I must have used tau_0 instead of tau.\n\nWait, no, because I computed tau as 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWhich is tau_0, not tau.\n\nAh! That's the mistake. Because tau_0 is the proper lifetime, and tau is gamma * tau_0.\n\nSo in the first approach, I mistakenly used tau_0 as the lab frame lifetime.\n\nSo I should have computed tau as gamma * tau_0 = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s = 1.371e-23 s.\n\nThen L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s = ?\n\n2.966e8 *1.371e-23 = (2.966 *1.371) *1e-15.\n\n2.966 *1.371 \u2248 4.064.\n\nSo 4.064e-15 m, which matches option B.\n\nAh, that's the mistake! In the first approach, I used tau_0 as tau, but I should have used tau = gamma * tau_0.\n\nSo the correct calculation is:\n\ntau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\ntau = gamma * tau_0 = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.371e-23 s.\n\nL = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s = 4.064e-15 m.\n\nWhich matches option B.\n\nSo the correct answer is B) 4.0655e-15 m.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about meson resonance and decay distance. I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonance... I think that has something to do with particles that don't exist long enough to be observed directly, so they're kind of like virtual particles.\n\nThe question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are given, so I guess I have to calculate it and see which one matches.\n\nWait, what's the formula for the mean decay distance? I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. So for a particle, the lifetime \u03c4 is approximately \u0127 divided by the width \u0393. Because \u0393 is the energy width, which is related to the uncertainty in energy, and \u03c4 would be the uncertainty in time.\n\nSo \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, I think the actual formula is \u03c4 = \u0127 / (\u0393/2), because the width \u0393 is the total decay width, and the uncertainty in energy is \u0393. So \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393), or maybe \u0127/(2\u0393)? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. I think the correct formula is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. Because \u0393 is the total decay width, which is the energy uncertainty, and the time uncertainty is \u0127 over that. Yeah, I'll go with \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nOnce I have the lifetime \u03c4, the mean decay distance is the speed of the particle multiplied by \u03c4. But wait, the particle is moving at relativistic speeds. So I can't just use the speed from non-relativistic mechanics. I need to calculate the relativistic velocity. Alternatively, since the particle's lifetime is dilated due to its high speed, maybe I should compute the proper lifetime and then multiply by velocity and Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, no, the mean lifetime \u03c4 is already the dilated lifetime. Because in particle physics, the lifetime given is usually the proper lifetime multiplied by the Lorentz factor \u03b3. So when I calculate the mean decay distance, it's v * \u03c4, since \u03c4 is the time experienced in the lab frame.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider the velocity as a function of the particle's energy. Because E is given as 8 GeV, which is much larger than the rest mass of 1.2 GeV. So the particle is ultra-relativistic, meaning v is approximately the speed of light c. So for calculation purposes, v \u2248 c = 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo putting it together, the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the mean lifetime \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n2. Multiply \u03c4 by the speed v (approx c) to get the mean decay distance.\n\nWait, but \u0393 is given in MeV. Oh right, I need to make sure the units are consistent. \u0127 has units of GeV\u00b7s or something like that? Let me check the value of \u0127 in units that match.\n\nI remember that \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So that's a useful number here. Because \u0393 is given in GeV, so when I divide \u0127 by \u0393 (in GeV), I'll get seconds.\n\nSo let's plug in the numbers. \u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s.\n\nCalculating that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, let me do that division properly. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance L is v * \u03c4. Since v \u2248 c, L \u2248 c * \u03c4.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s. So L = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?\n\nMultiplying those together: 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nWait, that's 6.17e-16 meters. But looking at the options, the closest is option A) 5.0223e-16 m or option D) 4.0655e-16 m. Hmm, none match 6e-16.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the units for \u0127. Let me confirm. \u0127 is 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. That's correct.\n\nWait, but the mass is 1.2 GeV, which is probably the rest mass. But in the decay, does the energy matter? Oh wait, in the problem statement, production energy is 8 GeV. Hmm, but for decay width, I think the energy is related to the mass. Wait, no, the width is a property of the particle, so it should be independent of the production energy. So perhaps the production energy is a red herring, or maybe it's needed for something else.\n\nWait, no, wait. The mean decay length depends on the velocity of the particle. So if the particle is moving at a high energy, its velocity is high. But earlier, I assumed v \u2248 c. But perhaps I should compute the velocity more accurately, using the energy.\n\nSo, the energy E is 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV. The energy of a relativistic particle is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). Wait, but E is given in GeV, and m is in GeV/c\u00b2. So when we write E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, in units where c=1, it's E = \u03b3 m. So \u03b3 = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So \u03b3 is approximately 6.6667.\n\nNow, \u03b2 = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). Since \u03b3 is large, \u03b2 is approximately 1. Let's compute it precisely. So 1/\u03b3\u00b2 is 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So \u03b2 \u2248 0.9887, so v \u2248 0.9887 c.\n\nSo L = v \u03c4 = \u03b2 c \u03c4.\n\nWait, earlier I calculated \u03c4 as 2.056875e-24 seconds. So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.056875e-24 s:\n\n2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?\n\nLet me compute 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.966 * 2.056875 * 1e8-24 = (about 6.115) * 1e-16.\n\nSo 6.115e-16 meters. That's approximately 6.1e-16 m.\n\nBut the options are A:5.02e-16, C:5.02e-15, B:4.06e-15, D:4.06e-16.\n\nHmm, my calculation is 6e-16, but none of the options match that. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of \u03c4. Let me recalculate \u03c4.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\n\u0127 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\n\u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute that precisely.\n\n6.582 divided by 0.32 equals: 6.582 / 0.32.\n\n0.32 * 20 = 6.4, which is less than 6.582. 20 * 0.32 = 6.4. 6.582 -6.4= 0.182. So 0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875.\n\nSo 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 GeV\u00b7s / GeV = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That part was correct.\n\nSo L = \u03b2 c \u03c4 = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3 * 2.056875e-16 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nThen multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 ?\n\n6.170625 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.108.\n\nSo 6.108e-16 meters. Still, none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Oh, wait! Because the particle is a resonance, it's off-shell, meaning it's not a stable particle. But when calculating decay length, perhaps I should use the mean lifetime of the particle, which is related to the width.\n\nWait, another thought: The mean lifetime \u03c4 is \u0127/(\u0393). But sometimes, people use the total decay width \u0393 and the natural line width formula, which is \u0393 = \u0127/\u03c4. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nWait, that's correct. So maybe the calculation is right.\n\nBut the options are lower. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the particle's velocity is not exactly c but less, but earlier calculation gave v about 0.9887 c. But that only reduces the distance from 6.1e-16 to about 6e-16, but the options are lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the energy. Wait, the production energy is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is 8 GeV minus rest mass energy (which is 1.2 GeV). So the kinetic energy is 6.8 GeV. But in relativistic terms, E = gamma m c^2. So gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667, which is what I did before. So that's correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the mean decay distance is calculated using the velocity of the particle, which is found from its energy. Let me think about that again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mean decay distance is given by L = c * tau * (1 - beta), but I don't think that's right. Or maybe L = gamma * beta * c * tau, but wait, tau is already multiplied by gamma. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So perhaps I was correct earlier.\n\nWait, another approach: The mean decay length is given by L = (v * gamma) * (c tau_0), where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. Wait, no, I think I'm getting mixed up.\n\nProper lifetime tau_0 is related to tau by tau = gamma tau_0. So tau_0 = tau / gamma.\n\nSo the mean decay length is v * tau_0 = v * (tau / gamma).\n\nWait, but v is beta c, so v * tau_0 = beta c * tau / gamma.\n\nBut tau is \u0127/(\u0393). So L = beta c * ( \u0127/(\u0393) ) / gamma.\n\nBut since gamma is E/(m c^2) = (8 GeV)/(1.2 GeV) ) = 6.6667.\n\nWait, let's compute this.\n\nL = (beta c) * ( \u0127/(\u0393) ) / gamma.\n\nBeta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 - (1/ (8/1.2)^2 )) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nGamma is 6.6667.\n\nSo L = (0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ) * (6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV ) / 6.6667.\n\nWait, let's compute each part.\n\nFirst, (6.582e-25 / 0.32) is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo,\n\n(0.9887 * 3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) / 6.6667.\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: 0.9887 *3e8 = 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.11e-16 m.\n\nNow divide by 6.6667: 6.11e-16 / 6.6667 \u2248 0.916e-16 = 9.16e-17 m. That's way smaller than before. But this doesn't make sense because earlier, I thought the decay length was 6e-16 m. So this approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the proper lifetime and the dilated lifetime. Let me think again.\n\nThe mean decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0. So the decay length is v * tau = v gamma tau_0.\n\nBut tau_0 is the proper lifetime, which is tau_0 = \u0127/(Gamma). So L = v gamma tau_0 = beta c gamma * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nBut beta gamma is gamma beta, which is (gamma) * (v/c) = (E/mc\u00b2) * (v/c). Hmm, but in any case, I think the correct approach is to use L = v * tau, where tau is the lifetime in the lab frame. Because tau already accounts for the time dilation. So earlier calculation of L \u2248 6.1e-16 m is correct.\n\nBut none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the width is given in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV, but wait, maybe I should convert it to the same units as \u0127. Let me check:\n\nNo, I think I did that correctly. Because \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s, and \u0393 is 0.32 GeV, so when I divide, the GeV cancels.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the possible mistakes.\n\nWait, perhaps the width is given as the natural width, which is 2\u0393. Because sometimes, the width is given as \u0393, but the actual line width is 2\u0393. Wait, no, I think that in particle physics, the width \u0393 is the total decay width, and the lifetime is \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the natural line width formula, where \u0393 = \u0127/tau. So tau = \u0127/\u0393. That's what I did earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the production energy affects the calculation. But the decay width is a property of the particle, so it should be independent of the production energy. So perhaps the production energy isn't needed for calculating the decay length. Hmm. So why is it given?\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the velocity using the production energy and the rest mass.\n\nWait, production energy E is 8 GeV, which is the total energy of the particle. So E = gamma m c^2. So gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) ) = 6.6667.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo v = beta c \u2248 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo using E, I correctly found beta and v.\n\nHmm, perhaps the error is that I should have used the natural unit conversion factors correctly. Let me check the value of \u0127 in units of GeV\u00b7s.\n\nYes, \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, all calculations look correct, but the result is 6.1e-16 m, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the mean decay length is not v * tau, but (v * gamma) * (tau_0), where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. But then tau_0 is \u0127 / Gamma, so L = v gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma ).\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\nv gamma = beta c gamma. Since beta gamma = gamma * v/c.\n\nBeta gamma is (gamma) * (v/c) = (gamma) * (sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) )\n\nWhich is approximately sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, gamma is 6.6667, so beta gamma = 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.583.\n\nSo L = beta gamma * c * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo beta gamma is approx 6.583.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo L = 6.583 * 3e8 m/s * (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV )\n\nCompute denominator: 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, compute numerator: 6.583 *3e8 *6.582e-25 = ?\n\nFirst, 6.583 *3e8 = 1.9749e9.\n\n1.9749e9 *6.582e-25 = (1.9749 *6.582) * 1e-16.\n\n1.9749 *6.582 \u2248 13.007.\n\nSo 13.007e-16 m.\n\nThen divide by 0.32 GeV: 13.007e-16 /0.32 = 40.646e-16 = 4.0646e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's 4.0646e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So that would be option B.\n\nWait, but why did this approach give a different result?\n\nAh, because when I used L = v * tau, I took tau as the dilated lifetime. But perhaps I should have used the proper lifetime. Let me clarify.\n\nThe mean lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0.\n\nThe proper lifetime tau_0 is tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nThe mean decay length is L = v tau = v gamma tau_0.\n\nWhich is the same as v gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo, L = (beta c gamma) * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is the same as beta gamma c * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is what I computed earlier.\n\nSo, according to this, L is about 4.064e-15 m, which matches option B.\n\nSo why did the initial approach give a different answer?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering that the velocity was used correctly. Let me see:\n\nIn the initial approach, I said L = v * tau.\n\nBut tau is the dilated lifetime, which is gamma tau_0.\n\nSo L = v * gamma tau_0.\n\nWhich is the same as beta c gamma tau_0.\n\nWhich is the same as beta gamma c * tau_0.\n\nBut tau_0 is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo L = beta gamma c * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is exactly what I did in the second approach, leading to 4.06e-15 m.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated L as v * tau, I used v as approximately c and tau as \u0127/(Gamma), which gave me 6e-16 m, which was incorrect.\n\nAh, so I think I messed up the initial approach because I didn't account for the fact that tau is already the dilated lifetime. So when I use v * tau, it's correct, but I have to ensure that the tau is the correct one.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I had:\n\ntau = \u0127 / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nThen L = v * tau = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWhich gave me 6.1e-16 m.\n\nBut according to the second approach, the correct way is L = beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma ), which gave me 4.06e-15 m.\n\nSo why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, because in the first approach, I used tau as the dilated lifetime, but I think I forgot that tau = gamma tau_0, and in the second approach, I used tau_0 = \u0127/Gamma, leading to the correct formula.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe proper lifetime tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nThe lab frame lifetime tau = gamma tau_0.\n\nSo the decay length is L = v tau = v gamma tau_0 = v gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is the same as beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo in the second approach, I correctly used beta gamma c * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nBut in the first approach, I used tau as the dilated lifetime, which is correct, but when I multiplied by v (which is beta c), I think I was correct.\n\nWait, but if I calculate L = v * tau = beta c * gamma tau_0 = beta gamma c tau_0.\n\nWhich is the same as beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo both approaches should give the same result. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, in the first approach:\n\nv = beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L = v * tau = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.\n\n2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.\n\n2.966 * 2.056875 \u2248 6.107.\n\nSo 6.107e-16 m.\n\nBut according to the second approach, I get 4.06e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's a factor of about 6.6 difference. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the second approach.\n\nWait, in the second approach, L = beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nbeta gamma is 6.583.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, 6.583 * 3e8 = 1.9749e9.\n\nMultiply by 6.582e-25: 1.9749e9 *6.582e-25 = 1.3007e-15.\n\nDivide by 0.32: 1.3007e-15 / 0.32 = 4.0646e-15 m.\n\nSo 4.0646e-15 m is option B.\n\nBut according to the first approach, I have 6.107e-16 m, which is 0.61e-15 m, which is about 1/6.6 of the second approach.\n\nSo where's the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps in the second approach, I forgot that tau_0 is \u0127 / (Gamma), but tau is gamma tau_0.\n\nSo L = v tau = v gamma tau_0.\n\nWhich is v gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo, v = beta c.\n\nThus, L = beta c gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nBut in the first approach, I have L = v tau = beta c * (gamma tau_0 ) = beta c gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma ), same as above.\n\nWait, but when I calculated it with the first approach, I got 6.1e-16, and with the second approach, 4.06e-15.\n\nSo that's a factor of 6.6 difference.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.\n\nWait, let's recompute the first approach:\n\nv = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.966e8 m/s.\n\ntau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?\n\nLet me compute 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.966 * 2.056875 * 1e-16.\n\n2.966 * 2.056875 = ?\n\nCalculating 2 *2.056875 =4.11375.\n\n0.966 *2.056875 \u2248 approx 2.000.\n\nSo total about 6.11375.\n\nSo 6.11375e-16 m.\n\nBut according to the second approach, it's 4.0646e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's a discrepancy of about a factor of 6.6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of \u0127. Let me check: \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used the total decay width as \u0393 = 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, but maybe it's given in the natural unit system where \u0127=1, and I'm supposed to adjust the units accordingly. Hmm, no, I think the approach was correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a miscalculation. Let me compute 6.583 *3e8 = ?\n\n6.583 *3e8 = 1.9749e9 m/s.\n\nThen, 1.9749e9 * 6.582e-25 = ?\n\n1.9749e9 *6.582e-25 = 1.9749 *6.582 = approx 13.007.\n\nSo 13.007e-16.\n\nThen, 13.007e-16 / 0.32 = 40.646e-16 = 4.0646e-15 m.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut the first approach gives 6.1e-16 m.\n\nWait, so the same calculation using two different methods gives two different results. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in the first approach, tau is the lab frame lifetime, so when I multiply by v, I get the correct decay length. But why does the second approach give a different result?\n\nAh! I think I see the mistake. In the second approach, I used L = beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma ), but beta gamma is (gamma) * (v/c) = gamma * beta.\n\nWait, but gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) = 8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 6.6667.\n\nBeta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444)) ) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo beta gamma is 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.583.\n\nSo, L = beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is 6.583 *3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV.\n\nWait, let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 6.583 *3e8 = 1.9749e9.\n\nMultiply by 6.582e-25: 1.9749e9 *6.582e-25 = (1.9749 *6.582) *1e-16 = approx 13.007 * 1e-16 = 1.3007e-15.\n\nDivide by 0.32: 1.3007e-15 / 0.32 = 4.0646e-15 m.\n\nBut in the first approach, the calculation was 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.107e-16 m.\n\nSo why the discrepancy? Because the first approach is correct? Or the second?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach. Let's think again.\n\nThe formula for decay length is L = v * tau.\n\nTau is the lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma * tau_0.\n\nTau_0 is the proper lifetime, which is tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo L = v * gamma * tau_0 = beta c * gamma * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is the same as beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is the same as (beta gamma) c ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut in the first approach, I computed L = v * tau, which is beta c * gamma tau_0 = beta gamma c ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is the same as the second approach.\n\nWait, so both approaches should give the same result. But why are they giving different results?\n\nAh! I think I made a mistake in the first approach's calculation. Let me recompute it.\n\nIn the first approach:\n\nv = beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nMultiply 2.966e8 by 2.056875e-24:\n\n2.966e8 = 2.966 * 1e8.\n\n2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 *1e-24.\n\nMultiply 2.966 * 2.056875 = let me compute:\n\n2.966 * 2 = 5.932.\n\n2.966 * 0.056875 \u2248 0.1684.\n\nTotal \u2248 6.1004.\n\nSo 6.1004e8-24 = 6.1004e-16 m.\n\nSo 6.1004e-16 m.\n\nBut according to the second approach, it's 4.0646e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's a factor of ~6.6667 difference. Which is exactly gamma (6.6667).\n\nWait, this suggests that in the first approach, I forgot to multiply by gamma.\n\nWait, no, because tau already includes gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.\n\nWait, tau is the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma * tau_0.\n\nTau_0 is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo tau = gamma * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo L = v * tau = v gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is beta c gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is the same as the second approach.\n\nSo why is the first approach giving me a different answer?\n\nWait, I think I see the mistake. In the first approach, I computed tau as \u0127 / Gamma, which is correct for tau_0, the proper lifetime. But in reality, tau is gamma * tau_0, so tau = gamma * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nSo when I compute L = v * tau, it's v * gamma ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWhich is the same as the second approach.\n\nSo in the first approach, I must have used tau_0 instead of tau.\n\nWait, no, because I computed tau as 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWhich is tau_0, not tau.\n\nAh! That's the mistake. Because tau_0 is the proper lifetime, and tau is gamma * tau_0.\n\nSo in the first approach, I mistakenly used tau_0 as the lab frame lifetime.\n\nSo I should have computed tau as gamma * tau_0 = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s = 1.371e-23 s.\n\nThen L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s = ?\n\n2.966e8 *1.371e-23 = (2.966 *1.371) *1e-15.\n\n2.966 *1.371 \u2248 4.064.\n\nSo 4.064e-15 m, which matches option B.\n\nAh, that's the mistake! In the first approach, I used tau_0 as tau, but I should have used tau = gamma * tau_0.\n\nSo the correct calculation is:\n\ntau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\ntau = gamma * tau_0 = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.371e-23 s.\n\nL = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s = 4.064e-15 m.\n\nWhich matches option B.\n\nSo the correct answer is B) 4.0655e-15 m.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the following steps:\n\n1. **Key Formula**: The mean decay distance \\( L \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   L = v \\cdot \\tau\n   \\]\n   where \\( v \\) is the particle's velocity and \\( \\tau \\) is the lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n2. **Lifetime in the Lab Frame**: The lifetime \\( \\tau \\) is related to the total decay width \\( \\Gamma \\) by:\n   \\[\n   \\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hbar \\) is approximately \\( 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s} \\), and \\( \\Gamma = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\). Substituting:\n   \\[\n   \\tau = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Relating Proper Lifetime to Lab Frame Lifetime**: The proper lifetime \\( \\tau_0 \\) is related to \\( \\tau \\) by the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\):\n   \\[\n   \\tau = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} \\). Since \\( \\tau \\) already accounts for time dilation, no further adjustment is needed.\n\n4. **Velocity of the Particle**: The particle's velocity \\( v \\) is determined from its energy \\( E = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) and rest mass \\( m = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} \\). Using the relativistic relation \\( E = \\gamma m \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} = \\frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.\n   \\]\n   The velocity \\( v \\) is then:\n   \\[\n   v = \\beta c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} \\cdot c.\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( \\gamma = 6.6667 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \\sqrt{0.9775} \\approx 0.9887.\n   \\]\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   v \\approx 0.9887 \\cdot c = 0.9887 \\cdot 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} = 2.966 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Mean Decay Distance**: Substituting \\( v \\) and \\( \\tau \\) into \\( L = v \\cdot \\tau \\):\n   \\[\n   L = (2.966 \\times 10^8) \\cdot (2.056875 \\times 10^{-24}) = 6.107 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Adjusting for Proper Lifetime**: To ensure consistency, the proper lifetime \\( \\tau_0 \\) is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}.\n   \\]\n   The lab frame lifetime \\( \\tau \\) is then:\n   \\[\n   \\tau = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0 = 6.6667 \\cdot 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} = 1.371 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{s}.\n   \\]\n   Using this \\( \\tau \\), the decay distance is:\n   \\[\n   L = v \\cdot \\tau = (2.966 \\times 10^8) \\cdot (1.371 \\times 10^{-23}) = 4.064 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Final Answer**: Comparing with the options, the closest match is:\n   \\[\n   L = 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe question gives me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. And I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so it's a very small distance, which makes sense because particles decay quickly.\n\nWait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and speed. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2, where c is the speed of light, \u03c4 is the mean lifetime, and \u03b2 is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light.\n\nSo first, I need to find the lifetime \u03c4. The mean lifetime is related to the width \u0393 by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. I think the relation is \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, but wait, units! I need to make sure all the units are compatible.\n\nLet me jot down the constants I'll need. Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Oh wait, yeah, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and I think \u0127 is about 197 MeV\u00b7fm, but maybe it's easier to use the value in GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation: 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should write that as 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 goes into 6.582 about 20.56875 times. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Okay.\n\nNext, I need to find the velocity \u03b2 of the meson. Since it's a resonance, I think it's moving relativistically. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV. So I can use the energy-momentum relation. The total energy E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. But since E is given, I can find \u03b3. Wait, but I'm not sure if I need to consider units correctly. Let me think in natural units where c=1 and \u0127=1, but maybe I should handle the units carefully.\n\nAlternatively, the energy E is the total energy, so E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ) / c\u00b2 ? Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the velocity using the energy and mass.\n\nWait, the relativistic energy is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2). But wait, since E and m are in GeV and GeV/c\u00b2, perhaps it's easier to work in units where c=1. So E = \u03b3 m. So \u03b3 = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667. So \u03b3 is about 6.6667.\n\nThen, the velocity \u03b2 is sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). Let me compute that. So 1/\u03b3\u00b2 is (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So \u03b2 \u2248 0.9887.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.9775 is under the square root. Let me see, 0.9887 squared is approximately (0.9887)^2 \u2248 0.9775? Let me compute 0.9887 * 0.9887: 0.9887 * 0.9887. Let me do it step by step: 0.98 * 0.98 is 0.9604. Then 0.0087 * 0.98 is about 0.008526. Wait, maybe a better way is to compute (1 - 0.0113)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0113 + (0.0113)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.0226 + 0.00012769 \u2248 0.97752769. So yeah, \u03b2 is about 0.9887.\n\nWait, another approach: Since \u03b3 = 6.6667, then \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444))) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. Yep.\n\nSo now, putting it all together, the mean decay distance is c * \u03c4 * \u03b2.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure the units are correct. Let me get the units right.\n\nSo, \u03c4 is in seconds, c is in m/s, \u03b2 is dimensionless. So distance would be (m/s) * s * (dimensionless) \u2192 meters.\n\nSo let's compute each part.\n\nFirst, c is approximately 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u03c4 is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\n\u03b2 is approximately 0.9887.\n\nSo distance = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2 = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 first. 3e8 is 3 * 10^8, 2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 * 10^-24.\n\nMultiply them: 3 * 2.056875 \u2248 6.170625, and 10^8 * 10^-24 is 10^-16. So that part is 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nNow multiply by \u03b2 (0.9887): 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 let's compute 6.170625 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.170625 * 0.9887 \u2248 let's see, 6 * 0.9887 is 5.9322. 0.170625 * 0.9887 \u2248 approx 0.169. So total is around 5.9322 + 0.169 = 6.1012, so 6.1012e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 m, option C is 5.0223e-15 m. Hmm, but my calculation here gives around 6e-16 m, which isn't matching any option. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation of \u03c4. Let me double-check that step.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32.\n\nWait, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating \u03b3 or \u03b2. Let me recalculate \u03b3 and \u03b2.\n\n\u03b3 = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666666..., which is 20/3, so approximately 6.6667.\n\nThen, \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(400/9))) )= sqrt(1 - 9/400) )= sqrt( (400-9)/400 )= sqrt(391/400) )= sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let's compute 391/400 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775. Let me use a calculator-like approach. Let me think, sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887, as I had before.\n\nHmm, maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let me compute 0.9887^2 = 0.9775, so that's correct.\n\nSo then the distance is c * tau * beta = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.9887.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.\n\n3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 = 6.170625, and 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16, so 6.170625e-16 m. Then multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 (6.170625 * 0.9887) e-16.\n\nCalculating 6.170625 * 0.9887:\n\nLet me compute 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.\n\n0.170625 * 0.9887: Let me compute 0.1 * 0.9887 = 0.09887, 0.07 * 0.9887 = ~0.069209, 0.000625 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.000618.\n\nAdding those: 0.09887 + 0.069209 = 0.168079, plus 0.000618 is 0.168697.\n\nSo total is 5.9322 + 0.168697 \u2248 6.0999, which is approximately 6.100e-16 meters.\n\nBut looking at the options, the closest is option A (5.0223e-16) and option D (4.0655e-16). Hmm, none of the options are near 6e-16. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the formula, the decay width is \u0393, which is related to the total decay rate. Also, the mean lifetime is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393, but sometimes \u0393 is given in the same units as \u0127. Wait, but I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me think: E is the total energy, so E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So, E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c^4.\n\nAlternatively, E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. So, let's compute p = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) ) / c^2. Wait, but I'm using natural units where c=1, so E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m\u00b2. So p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2) = sqrt( (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 ) GeV. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. sqrt(62.56) \u2248 7.91 GeV/c. So p = 7.91 GeV/c.\n\nThen, the velocity \u03b2 = (p c) / E = (7.91 GeV/c * c ) / 8 GeV ) = 7.91 / 8 \u2248 0.98875. So that's the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width. Oh wait, the mean decay length is also sometimes approximated using the formula L = (c * tau) * beta gamma. Wait, no, that's for the proper lifetime. Wait, no, wait. The mean lifetime \u03c4 is the proper lifetime, and the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4. Oh wait, no. No, wait. The mean lifetime \u03c4 is the proper lifetime, so the lifetime observed in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nWait, but in the decay length calculation, the formula is L = beta gamma c tau. Because the particle is moving at velocity beta c, and its lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the distance would be beta c * gamma tau.\n\nWait, wait, so maybe I missed the gamma factor earlier. Because tau is the proper lifetime, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau. So the decay length is L = beta c * (gamma tau).\n\nSo that would change things. So I think I made a mistake earlier by not including the gamma factor in the lab frame lifetime.\n\nSo let me recalculate that.\n\nSo the correct formula is L = beta * c * gamma * tau.\n\nWait, but tau is the proper lifetime, so yes. Because in the particle's rest frame, it lives for tau, but in the lab frame, it's moving, so it lives longer, gamma times longer. So the decay length is beta c multiplied by gamma tau.\n\nWait, so in my initial calculation, I used L = c * tau * beta, but I forgot to include gamma. So I should have used L = beta * c * gamma * tau.\n\nSo I need to recalculate with that in mind.\n\nSo gamma is 6.6667, as before.\n\nSo let's compute:\n\nL = beta * c * gamma * tau.\n\nSo let's plug in the numbers.\n\nBeta is 0.9887.\n\nGamma is 6.6667.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 0.9887 * 6.6667 \u2248 6.6 (since 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.6).\n\nWait, let me compute 6.6667 * 0.9887:\n\n6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.\n\n0.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 approximately 0.6598.\n\nSo total is 5.9322 + 0.6598 \u2248 6.592.\n\nSo 0.9887 * 6.6667 \u2248 6.592.\n\nThen, 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nNow multiply this by 6.592:\n\n6.170625e-16 m * 6.592 \u2248 ?\n\n6 * 6.170625e-16 is 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.592 * 6.170625e-16 \u2248 approximately 3.654e-16.\n\nAdding together: 3.702375e-15 + 3.654e-16 = 3.702375e-15 + 0.3654e-15 = 4.067775e-15 m.\n\nHmm, that's about 4.068e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So the calculation gives approximately 4.0678e-15 m, which is very close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nWait, why is this happening? Because I initially forgot the gamma factor, which made the distance longer than my first calculation.

Let me recompute beta * gamma more accurately.\n\nGamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.66666667.\n\nBeta is sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) )= sqrt(1 - 0.0225) )= sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo beta * gamma is 0.9887 * 6.66666667.\n\nCompute 0.9887 * 6 = 5.9322.\n\n0.9887 * 0.66666667 = approximately 0.6591.\n\nAdding: 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.\n\nSo beta * gamma \u2248 6.5913.\n\nNow, c * tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nSo 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 = ?\n\n6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.5913 * 6.170625e-16 = let's compute:\n\n0.5 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.0853125e-16.\n\n0.0913 * 6.170625e-16 \u2248 0.0913 * 6.170625 = approximately 0.562e-15.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 0.5913 * 6.170625e-16.\n\n6.170625e-16 * 0.5913 = ?\n\nWell, 6.170625 * 0.5913 \u2248 let's compute 6 * 0.5913 = 3.5478, 0.170625 * 0.5913 \u2248 0.1009.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe question gives me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. And I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so it's a very small distance, which makes sense because particles decay quickly.\n\nWait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and speed. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2, where c is the speed of light, \u03c4 is the mean lifetime, and \u03b2 is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light.\n\nSo first, I need to find the lifetime \u03c4. The mean lifetime is related to the width \u0393 by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. I think the relation is \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, but wait, units! I need to make sure all the units are compatible.\n\nLet me jot down the constants I'll need. Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Oh wait, yeah, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and I think \u0127 is about 197 MeV\u00b7fm, but maybe it's easier to use the value in GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation: 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should write that as 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 goes into 6.582 about 20.56875 times. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Okay.\n\nNext, I need to find the velocity \u03b2 of the meson. Since it's a resonance, I think it's moving relativistically. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV. So I can use the energy-momentum relation. The total energy E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. But since E is given, I can find \u03b3. Wait, but I'm not sure if I need to consider units correctly. Let me think in natural units where c=1 and \u0127=1, but maybe I should handle the units carefully.\n\nAlternatively, the energy E is the total energy, so E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ) / c\u00b2 ? Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the velocity using the energy and mass.\n\nWait, the relativistic energy is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2). But wait, since E and m are in GeV and GeV/c\u00b2, perhaps it's easier to work in units where c=1. So E = \u03b3 m. So \u03b3 = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667. So \u03b3 is about 6.6667.\n\nThen, the velocity \u03b2 is sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). Let me compute that. So 1/\u03b3\u00b2 is (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So \u03b2 \u2248 0.9887.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.9775 is under the square root. Let me see, 0.9887 squared is approximately (0.9887)^2 \u2248 0.9775? Let me compute 0.9887 * 0.9887: 0.9887 * 0.9887. Let me do it step by step: 0.98 * 0.98 is 0.9604. Then 0.0087 * 0.98 is about 0.008526. Wait, maybe a better way is to compute (1 - 0.0113)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0113 + (0.0113)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.0226 + 0.00012769 \u2248 0.97752769. So yeah, \u03b2 is about 0.9887.\n\nWait, another approach: Since \u03b3 = 6.6667, then \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444))) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. Yep.\n\nSo now, putting it all together, the mean decay distance is c * \u03c4 * \u03b2.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure the units are correct. Let me get the units right.\n\nSo, \u03c4 is in seconds, c is in m/s, \u03b2 is dimensionless. So distance would be (m/s) * s * (dimensionless) \u2192 meters.\n\nSo let's compute each part.\n\nFirst, c is approximately 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u03c4 is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\n\u03b2 is approximately 0.9887.\n\nSo distance = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2 = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 first. 3e8 is 3 * 10^8, 2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 * 10^-24.\n\nMultiply them: 3 * 2.056875 \u2248 6.170625, and 10^8 * 10^-24 is 10^-16. So that part is 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nNow multiply by \u03b2 (0.9887): 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 let's compute 6.170625 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.170625 * 0.9887 \u2248 let's see, 6 * 0.9887 is 5.9322. 0.170625 * 0.9887 \u2248 approx 0.169. So total is around 5.9322 + 0.169 = 6.1012, so 6.1012e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 m, option C is 5.0223e-15 m. Hmm, but my calculation here gives around 6e-16 m, which isn't matching any option. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation of \u03c4. Let me double-check that step.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32.\n\nWait, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating \u03b3 or \u03b2. Let me recalculate \u03b3 and \u03b2.\n\n\u03b3 = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666666..., which is 20/3, so approximately 6.6667.\n\nThen, \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(400/9))) )= sqrt(1 - 9/400) )= sqrt( (400-9)/400 )= sqrt(391/400) )= sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let's compute 391/400 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775. Let me use a calculator-like approach. Let me think, sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887, as I had before.\n\nHmm, maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let me compute 0.9887^2 = 0.9775, so that's correct.\n\nSo then the distance is c * tau * beta = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.9887.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.\n\n3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 = 6.170625, and 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16, so 6.170625e-16 m. Then multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 (6.170625 * 0.9887) e-16.\n\nCalculating 6.170625 * 0.9887:\n\nLet me compute 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.\n\n0.170625 * 0.9887: Let me compute 0.1 * 0.9887 = 0.09887, 0.07 * 0.9887 = ~0.069209, 0.000625 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.000618.\n\nAdding those: 0.09887 + 0.069209 = 0.168079, plus 0.000618 is 0.168697.\n\nSo total is 5.9322 + 0.168697 \u2248 6.0999, which is approximately 6.100e-16 meters.\n\nBut looking at the options, the closest is option A (5.0223e-16) and option D (4.0655e-16). Hmm, none of the options are near 6e-16. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the formula, the decay width is \u0393, which is related to the total decay rate. Also, the mean lifetime is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393, but sometimes \u0393 is given in the same units as \u0127. Wait, but I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me think: E is the total energy, so E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So, E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c^4.\n\nAlternatively, E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. So, let's compute p = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) ) / c^2. Wait, but I'm using natural units where c=1, so E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m\u00b2. So p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2) = sqrt( (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 ) GeV. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. sqrt(62.56) \u2248 7.91 GeV/c. So p = 7.91 GeV/c.\n\nThen, the velocity \u03b2 = (p c) / E = (7.91 GeV/c * c ) / 8 GeV ) = 7.91 / 8 \u2248 0.98875. So that's the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width. Oh wait, the mean decay length is also sometimes approximated using the formula L = (c * tau) * beta gamma. Wait, no, that's for the proper lifetime. Wait, no, wait. The mean lifetime \u03c4 is the proper lifetime, and the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4. Oh wait, no. No, wait. The mean lifetime \u03c4 is the proper lifetime, so the lifetime observed in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nWait, but in the decay length calculation, the formula is L = beta gamma c tau. Because the particle is moving at velocity beta c, and its lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the distance would be beta c * gamma tau.\n\nWait, wait, so maybe I missed the gamma factor earlier. Because tau is the proper lifetime, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau. So the decay length is L = beta c * (gamma tau).\n\nSo that would change things. So I think I made a mistake earlier by not including the gamma factor in the lab frame lifetime.\n\nSo let me recalculate that.\n\nSo the correct formula is L = beta * c * gamma * tau.\n\nWait, but tau is the proper lifetime, so yes. Because in the particle's rest frame, it lives for tau, but in the lab frame, it's moving, so it lives longer, gamma times longer. So the decay length is beta c multiplied by gamma tau.\n\nWait, so in my initial calculation, I used L = c * tau * beta, but I forgot to include gamma. So I should have used L = beta * c * gamma * tau.\n\nSo I need to recalculate with that in mind.\n\nSo gamma is 6.6667, as before.\n\nSo let's compute:\n\nL = beta * c * gamma * tau.\n\nSo let's plug in the numbers.\n\nBeta is 0.9887.\n\nGamma is 6.6667.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 0.9887 * 6.6667 \u2248 6.6 (since 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.6).\n\nWait, let me compute 6.6667 * 0.9887:\n\n6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.\n\n0.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 approximately 0.6598.\n\nSo total is 5.9322 + 0.6598 \u2248 6.592.\n\nSo 0.9887 * 6.6667 \u2248 6.592.\n\nThen, 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nNow multiply this by 6.592:\n\n6.170625e-16 m * 6.592 \u2248 ?\n\n6 * 6.170625e-16 is 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.592 * 6.170625e-16 \u2248 approximately 3.654e-16.\n\nAdding together: 3.702375e-15 + 3.654e-16 = 3.702375e-15 + 0.3654e-15 = 4.067775e-15 m.\n\nHmm, that's about 4.068e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So the calculation gives approximately 4.0678e-15 m, which is very close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nWait, why is this happening? Because I initially forgot the gamma factor, which made the distance longer than my first calculation. So the correct approach includes gamma in the lifetime.\n\nSo the correct formula is L = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nSo let me recheck the calculations with this corrected approach.\n\nCompute tau: 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nGamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666... \u2248 6.6667.\n\nBeta is sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))) = sqrt(1 - (1/44.4444)) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo L = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nbeta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 \u2248 6.592.\n\nc * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nSo 6.592 * 6.170625e-16 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.592 * 6.170625e-16 = approximately 3.654e-16.\n\nAdding together gives 3.702375e-15 + 3.654e-16 = 4.067775e-15 m.\n\nWhich is very close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m. So the correct answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nB)4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nC)5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n\nD)4.0655 * 10^-16 m.\n\nSo my calculation gives 4.0678e-15, which is approximately option B.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recompute beta * gamma more accurately.\n\nGamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.66666667.\n\nBeta is sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) )= sqrt(1 - 0.0225) )= sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo beta * gamma is 0.9887 * 6.66666667.\n\nCompute 0.9887 * 6 = 5.9322.\n\n0.9887 * 0.66666667 = approximately 0.6591.\n\nAdding: 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.\n\nSo beta * gamma \u2248 6.5913.\n\nNow, c * tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nSo 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 = ?\n\n6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.5913 * 6.170625e-16 = let's compute:\n\n0.5 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.0853125e-16.\n\n0.0913 * 6.170625e-16 \u2248 0.0913 * 6.170625 = approximately 0.562e-15.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 0.5913 * 6.170625e-16.\n\n6.170625e-16 * 0.5913 = ?\n\nWell, 6.170625 * 0.5913 \u2248 let's compute 6 * 0.5913 = 3.5478, 0.170625 * 0.5913 \u2248 0.1009. So total is about 3.6487.\n\nSo 3.6487e-16.\n\nAdding to the 3.702375e-15:\n\n3.702375e-15 + 3.6487e-16 = 3.702375e-15 + 0.36487e-15 = 4.067245e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.067e-15 m, very close to option B's 4.0655e-15 m. So that must be the correct answer.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nL = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\beta \\) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,\n- \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light (\\( 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)),\n- \\( \\tau \\) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the proper mean lifetime \\( \\tau \\)\nThe proper mean lifetime \\( \\tau \\) is related to the decay width \\( \\Gamma \\) by:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( \\hbar = 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s} \\) and \\( \\Gamma = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\)\nThe Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( E = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) is the total energy and \\( m = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) is the mass.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with a different value in meters.\n\nWait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) is related to how long a particle lives before decaying. The longer the lifetime, the further it can travel before breaking apart. But how do I calculate that?\n\nI think the formula involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay distance L is given by L = \u03b3 * \u03b2 * c * \u03c4, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, \u03b2 is the velocity over the speed of light, c is the speed of light, and \u03c4 is the proper lifetime.\n\nBut wait, do I have all these values? Hmm. I have E_X, m_X, and \u0393_X. How do these relate to \u03c4?\n\nOh, right! The width \u0393 is related to the lifetime \u03c4 through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is \u0393 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4, so \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, units are important here. \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 has units of GeV\u00b7s when using natural units, but I think I need to convert everything properly.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The natural units where \u0127 = c = 1 are often used in particle physics. But when calculating real-world quantities like distance, I need to convert back to SI units.\n\nSo first, let's find the lifetime \u03c4. \u0393 is the total decay width, and \u03c4 is the mean lifetime, which is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But since \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 is usually expressed in units like GeV\u00b7s, I need to handle the units carefully.\n\nWait, let me get the units right. \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, if \u0393 is in GeV, then \u03c4 would be in seconds. But \u0393 here is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, that seems very small. Is that right? Because \u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So yes, dividing 6.58e-25 by 0.32 gives roughly 2e-24 seconds. That makes sense because the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width.\n\nNext, I need to find the velocity \u03b2. Since the particle is a meson, I can probably assume it's moving relativistically. To find \u03b2, I can use the energy and mass.\n\nEnergy E is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass m is 1.2 GeV. The total energy E is related to the rest mass and the momentum. The formula is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. But since I'm using natural units (c=1), this simplifies to E^2 = p^2 + m^2.\n\nSo, p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) GeV. Let's compute that. 8 squared is 64, 1.2 squared is 1.44. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p = sqrt(62.56) GeV. The square root of 62.56 is about 7.91 GeV. Because 7.91^2 is approximately 62.56.\n\nNow, \u03b2 is p c / E. But again, in natural units, c=1, so \u03b2 = p / E. So beta is 7.91 / 8 \u2248 0.98875. That's a pretty high speed, as expected.\n\nNext, the Lorentz factor \u03b3 is E / (m c^2), but again, in natural units, \u03b3 = E / m. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so \u03b3 = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nSo putting it all together, the mean decay distance L is \u03b3 * \u03b2 * c * \u03c4.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, \u03c4 is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nc is the speed of light, which is approximately 3e8 meters per second.\n\nSo c * \u03c4 is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nThen multiply by \u03b3 (6.6667) and \u03b2 (0.98875).\n\nSo 6.6667 * 0.98875 \u2248 6.600 (approximately). Let me compute that more accurately.\n\n0.98875 * 6.6667:\n\n6.6667 * 0.98875 \u2248 6.6667*(1 - 0.01125) = 6.6667 - 6.6667*0.01125.\n\n6.6667 * 0.01125 = approximately 0.075.\n\nSo 6.6667 - 0.075 \u2248 6.5917.\n\nSo the product \u03b3*\u03b2 is about 6.5917.\n\nMultiply this by c*\u03c4 (6.170625e-16 m) to get L.\n\n6.5917 * 6.170625e-16 = let's calculate that.\n\n6 * 6.1706e-16 is about 3.7e-15. But more accurately, 6.5917 * 6.170625e-16.\n\nLet me compute 6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.5917 *6.170625e-16 = let's see.\n\n0.5 *6.1706e-16=3.0853e-16.\n\n0.0917 *6.1706e-16 \u2248 5.65e-17.\n\nSo 3.0853e-16 +5.65e-17=3.6503e-16.\n\nSo total is 3.702375e-15 + 3.6503e-16 = 4.0674e-15 meters.\n\nWait, that's approximately 4.067e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. Hmm, but my calculation here gives about 4.067e-15, which is close to option B.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me double-check that.\n\nE =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.\n\nGamma is E/(m c\u00b2) but since c=1 in natural units, it's 8 /1.2 = 6.666666...\n\nYes, that's correct. Beta was p/E, which I calculated as 7.91/8=0.98875.\n\nSo gamma*beta is 6.66667 * 0.98875 = approximately 6.591666...\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\n6.666666... * 0.98875.\n\nLet me compute 6.666666... * 0.98875.\n\n0.98875 = 1 - 0.01125.\n\nSo 6.666666 * 1 =6.666666.\n\n6.666666 * 0.01125 = 0.075.\n\nSo 6.666666 -0.075 =6.591666...\n\nSo gamma*beta is approximately 6.59166667.\n\nThen, c*tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply 6.59166667 by 6.170625e-16.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6.59166667 * 6.170625e-16.\n\n6 *6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.59166667 *6.170625e-16 = let's compute 0.5*6.170625e-16 =3.0853125e-16.\n\n0.09166667 *6.170625e-16 = approximately 0.09166667 *6.170625e-16.\n\n0.09 *6.170625e-16 = 5.5535625e-17.\n\n0.00166667 *6.170625e-16 \u2248 1.0284375e-18.\n\nAdding these together: 5.5535625e-17 + 1.0284375e-18 \u2248 5.65640625e-17.\n\nSo 3.0853125e-16 +5.65640625e-17 = 3.650953125e-16.\n\nNow, adding that to the 3.702375e-15:\n\n3.702375e-15 +3.650953125e-16 = 4.0674703125e-15 m.\n\nSo approximately 4.0675e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B: 4.0655 *10^-15 m.\n\nOption C:5.0223 *10^-15 m.\n\nHmm, the closest is option B. But wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation of c*tau?\n\nWait, let me recheck that.\n\nTau is \u0127 / \u0393.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo tau = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo c*tau is 3e8 *2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nGamma is 8 /1.2 =6.666666...\n\nBeta is sqrt( (E^2 - m^2)/E^2 ) = sqrt( (64 - 1.44)/64 )=sqrt(62.56/64)=sqrt(0.977375)=approx 0.98875.\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(62.56) more accurately.\n\nWait, 62.56 is between 7.9^2=62.41 and 7.92^2=62.7264.\n\nWait, 7.91^2 = (7.9 +0.01)^2 =7.9^2 + 2*7.9*0.01 +0.01^2 =62.41 +0.158 +0.0001=62.5681.\n\nSo 7.91^2 is 62.5681, which is just a bit above 62.56. So sqrt(62.56)= approximately 7.91 - a tiny bit.\n\nSo p=7.91 GeV/c approximately.\n\nSo beta= p/E =7.91/8=0.98875.\n\nSo I think the calculation is correct, leading to L\u22484.067e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close.\n\nWait, but why is option C about 5e-15? Maybe I made a miscalculation in gamma or beta.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the energy E is not the total energy but something else? Wait, the problem states E_X=8 GeV, which is the production energy. So that's the total energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nThe mean decay length is L= gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother point: perhaps the lifetime is calculated as tau= \u0127/(Gamma), but sometimes people use tau= \u0127/(Gamma/2), but I think that's only when the width is given as the natural linewidth (like in resonance peaks). Wait, in particle physics, the width Gamma is related to the lifetime by Gamma = \u0127 / tau. So yes, tau= \u0127/Gamma.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-calculate the exact numbers with more precision.\n\nLet me recompute gamma*beta*c*tau.\n\nGamma: 8 /1.2 = 6.66666666667.\n\nBeta: sqrt( (8^2 -1.2^2 ) ) /8 = sqrt(62.56)/8.\n\nCompute sqrt(62.56) accurately. Let's see, 7.91^2 is 62.5681, so 7.91^2=62.5681. Our value is 62.56, which is 0.0081 less.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with a different value in meters.\n\nWait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) is related to how long a particle lives before decaying. The longer the lifetime, the further it can travel before breaking apart. But how do I calculate that?\n\nI think the formula involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay distance L is given by L = \u03b3 * \u03b2 * c * \u03c4, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, \u03b2 is the velocity over the speed of light, c is the speed of light, and \u03c4 is the proper lifetime.\n\nBut wait, do I have all these values? Hmm. I have E_X, m_X, and \u0393_X. How do these relate to \u03c4?\n\nOh, right! The width \u0393 is related to the lifetime \u03c4 through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is \u0393 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4, so \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, units are important here. \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 has units of GeV\u00b7s when using natural units, but I think I need to convert everything properly.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The natural units where \u0127 = c = 1 are often used in particle physics. But when calculating real-world quantities like distance, I need to convert back to SI units.\n\nSo first, let's find the lifetime \u03c4. \u0393 is the total decay width, and \u03c4 is the mean lifetime, which is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But since \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 is usually expressed in units like GeV\u00b7s, I need to handle the units carefully.\n\nWait, let me get the units right. \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So, if \u0393 is in GeV, then \u03c4 would be in seconds. But \u0393 here is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, that seems very small. Is that right? Because \u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So yes, dividing 6.58e-25 by 0.32 gives roughly 2e-24 seconds. That makes sense because the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width.\n\nNext, I need to find the velocity \u03b2. Since the particle is a meson, I can probably assume it's moving relativistically. To find \u03b2, I can use the energy and mass.\n\nEnergy E is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass m is 1.2 GeV. The total energy E is related to the rest mass and the momentum. The formula is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. But since I'm using natural units (c=1), this simplifies to E^2 = p^2 + m^2.\n\nSo, p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) GeV. Let's compute that. 8 squared is 64, 1.2 squared is 1.44. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p = sqrt(62.56) GeV. The square root of 62.56 is about 7.91 GeV. Because 7.91^2 is approximately 62.56.\n\nNow, \u03b2 is p c / E. But again, in natural units, c=1, so \u03b2 = p / E. So beta is 7.91 / 8 \u2248 0.98875. That's a pretty high speed, as expected.\n\nNext, the Lorentz factor \u03b3 is E / (m c^2), but again, in natural units, \u03b3 = E / m. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so \u03b3 = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nSo putting it all together, the mean decay distance L is \u03b3 * \u03b2 * c * \u03c4.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, \u03c4 is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nc is the speed of light, which is approximately 3e8 meters per second.\n\nSo c * \u03c4 is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nThen multiply by \u03b3 (6.6667) and \u03b2 (0.98875).\n\nSo 6.6667 * 0.98875 \u2248 6.600 (approximately). Let me compute that more accurately.\n\n0.98875 * 6.6667:\n\n6.6667 * 0.98875 \u2248 6.6667*(1 - 0.01125) = 6.6667 - 6.6667*0.01125.\n\n6.6667 * 0.01125 = approximately 0.075.\n\nSo 6.6667 - 0.075 \u2248 6.5917.\n\nSo the product \u03b3*\u03b2 is about 6.5917.\n\nMultiply this by c*\u03c4 (6.170625e-16 m) to get L.\n\n6.5917 * 6.170625e-16 = let's calculate that.\n\n6 * 6.1706e-16 is about 3.7e-15. But more accurately, 6.5917 * 6.170625e-16.\n\nLet me compute 6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.5917 *6.170625e-16 = let's see.\n\n0.5 *6.1706e-16=3.0853e-16.\n\n0.0917 *6.1706e-16 \u2248 5.65e-17.\n\nSo 3.0853e-16 +5.65e-17=3.6503e-16.\n\nSo total is 3.702375e-15 + 3.6503e-16 = 4.0674e-15 meters.\n\nWait, that's approximately 4.067e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. Hmm, but my calculation here gives about 4.067e-15, which is close to option B.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me double-check that.\n\nE =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.\n\nGamma is E/(m c\u00b2) but since c=1 in natural units, it's 8 /1.2 = 6.666666...\n\nYes, that's correct. Beta was p/E, which I calculated as 7.91/8=0.98875.\n\nSo gamma*beta is 6.66667 * 0.98875 = approximately 6.591666...\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\n6.666666... * 0.98875.\n\nLet me compute 6.666666... * 0.98875.\n\n0.98875 = 1 - 0.01125.\n\nSo 6.666666 * 1 =6.666666.\n\n6.666666 * 0.01125 = 0.075.\n\nSo 6.666666 -0.075 =6.591666...\n\nSo gamma*beta is approximately 6.59166667.\n\nThen, c*tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply 6.59166667 by 6.170625e-16.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6.59166667 * 6.170625e-16.\n\n6 *6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.59166667 *6.170625e-16 = let's compute 0.5*6.170625e-16 =3.0853125e-16.\n\n0.09166667 *6.170625e-16 = approximately 0.09166667 *6.170625e-16.\n\n0.09 *6.170625e-16 = 5.5535625e-17.\n\n0.00166667 *6.170625e-16 \u2248 1.0284375e-18.\n\nAdding these together: 5.5535625e-17 + 1.0284375e-18 \u2248 5.65640625e-17.\n\nSo 3.0853125e-16 +5.65640625e-17 = 3.650953125e-16.\n\nNow, adding that to the 3.702375e-15:\n\n3.702375e-15 +3.650953125e-16 = 4.0674703125e-15 m.\n\nSo approximately 4.0675e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B: 4.0655 *10^-15 m.\n\nOption C:5.0223 *10^-15 m.\n\nHmm, the closest is option B. But wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation of c*tau?\n\nWait, let me recheck that.\n\nTau is \u0127 / \u0393.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo tau = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo c*tau is 3e8 *2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nGamma is 8 /1.2 =6.666666...\n\nBeta is sqrt( (E^2 - m^2)/E^2 ) = sqrt( (64 - 1.44)/64 )=sqrt(62.56/64)=sqrt(0.977375)=approx 0.98875.\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(62.56) more accurately.\n\nWait, 62.56 is between 7.9^2=62.41 and 7.92^2=62.7264.\n\nWait, 7.91^2 = (7.9 +0.01)^2 =7.9^2 + 2*7.9*0.01 +0.01^2 =62.41 +0.158 +0.0001=62.5681.\n\nSo 7.91^2 is 62.5681, which is just a bit above 62.56. So sqrt(62.56)= approximately 7.91 - a tiny bit.\n\nSo p=7.91 GeV/c approximately.\n\nSo beta= p/E =7.91/8=0.98875.\n\nSo I think the calculation is correct, leading to L\u22484.067e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close.\n\nWait, but why is option C about 5e-15? Maybe I made a miscalculation in gamma or beta.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the energy E is not the total energy but something else? Wait, the problem states E_X=8 GeV, which is the production energy. So that's the total energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nThe mean decay length is L= gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother point: perhaps the lifetime is calculated as tau= \u0127/(Gamma), but sometimes people use tau= \u0127/(Gamma/2), but I think that's only when the width is given as the natural linewidth (like in resonance peaks). Wait, in particle physics, the width Gamma is related to the lifetime by Gamma = \u0127 / tau. So yes, tau= \u0127/Gamma.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-calculate the exact numbers with more precision.\n\nLet me recompute gamma*beta*c*tau.\n\nGamma: 8 /1.2 = 6.66666666667.\n\nBeta: sqrt( (8^2 -1.2^2 ) ) /8 = sqrt(62.56)/8.\n\nCompute sqrt(62.56) accurately. Let's see, 7.91^2 is 62.5681, so 7.91^2=62.5681. Our value is 62.56, which is 0.0081 less. So sqrt(62.56)=7.91 - delta.\n\nWe can approximate using a Taylor expansion.\n\nLet f(x)=sqrt(x). f'(x)=1/(2 sqrt(x)).\n\nWe know f(62.5681)=7.91. Let x=62.5681, and we want f(x -0.0081) = f(x) - delta.\n\ndelta \u2248 (0.0081) * f'(x) = 0.0081 * (1/(2*7.91)) )=0.0081/(15.82) \u2248 0.000511.\n\nSo sqrt(62.56)=7.91 -0.000511\u22487.909489.\n\nSo beta=7.909489 /8 = approx 0.988686.\n\nSo gamma*beta=6.6666667 *0.988686.\n\nLet me compute 6.6666667 *0.988686.\n\n6 *0.988686 =5.932116.\n\n0.6666667 *0.988686 \u2248 approx 0.6666667 *0.988686.\n\n0.6666667 *0.988686 \u2248 0.660457.\n\nSo total is 5.932116 +0.660457=6.592573.\n\nSo gamma*beta \u22486.592573.\n\nNow, c*tau=3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s=6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply gamma*beta (6.592573) by 6.170625e-16.\n\n6.592573 *6.170625e-16 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6 *6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.\n\n0.592573 *6.170625e-16.\n\n0.5 *6.170625e-16=3.0853125e-16.\n\n0.092573 *6.170625e-16.\n\nCompute 0.09 *6.170625e-16=5.5535625e-17.\n\n0.002573 *6.170625e-16 \u2248 1.580e-18.\n\nSo 5.5535625e-17 +1.580e-18 = 5.7115e-17.\n\nAdding to the 3.0853125e-16: 3.0853125e-16 +5.7115e-17 =3.6564625e-16.\n\nSo total is 3.702375e-15 +3.6564625e-16 =4.067, which is 4.067e-15 meters.\n\nWait, that's 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B:4.0655e-15.\n\nBut perhaps the precise calculation with exact numbers would bring it to 4.0655e-15.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the constants.\n\nLet me re-calculate tau using more precise \u0127.\n\nThe value of \u0127 is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo tau=6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 /0.32 )e-25 =20.56875e-25 =2.056875e-24 s.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nc is 2.99792458e8 m/s, but using 3e8 is an approximation. Let me use more precise c.\n\nc=2.99792458e8 m/s.\n\nSo c*tau=2.99792458e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s = ?\n\n2.99792458e8 *2.056875e-24 = (2.99792458 *2.056875) *1e-16.\n\nCompute 2.99792458 *2.056875.\n\nLet me compute 2 *2.056875 =4.11375.\n\n0.99792458 *2.056875 \u2248 approximately 2.055.\n\nWait, 0.99792458 is about 1 - 0.00207542.\n\nSo 2.056875 *0.99792458 \u2248 2.056875 - (2.056875 *0.00207542).\n\n2.056875 *0.00207542 \u22480.004261.\n\nSo 2.056875 -0.004261\u22482.052614.\n\nSo total 2.99792458 *2.056875 \u22484.11375 +2.052614\u22486.166364.\n\nSo c*tau \u22486.166364e-16 m.\n\nNow, gamma*beta is 6.592573.\n\nSo 6.592573 *6.166364e-16.\n\nCompute 6 *6.166364e-16=3.7e-15.\n\n0.592573 *6.166364e-16.\n\nCompute 0.5 *6.166364e-16=3.083182e-16.\n\n0.092573 *6.166364e-16.\n\nCompute 0.09 *6.166364e-16=5.5497276e-17.\n\n0.002573 *6.166364e-16\u22481.583e-18.\n\nSo adding 5.5497276e-17 +1.583e-18=5.708e-17.\n\nAdding to 3.083182e-16: 3.083182e-16 +5.708e-17=3.653982e-16.\n\nSo total L=3.7e-15 +3.653982e-16=4.065398e-15 m.\n\nAh, that's approximately 4.0654e-15 m, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15 m).
