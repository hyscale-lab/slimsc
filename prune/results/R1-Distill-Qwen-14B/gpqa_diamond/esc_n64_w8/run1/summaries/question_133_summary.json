      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and figure out what I need to do. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Both are 1 gram each in 200 cm\u00b3 of solution. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. \n\nWait, orthophosphate ions are PO4^3- right? Or wait, sometimes orthophosphate is HPO4^2-? I think orthophosphate is H3PO4, but wait, no, in solution, H3PO4 dissociates. Let me think. Oh, right, the various species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it's in solution, it can lose protons. So in this problem, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. \n\nI remember that when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can get a buffer solution. Since KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (which is a weak acid, since H3PO4 is a triprotic acid), and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (the conjugate base of H2PO4^-). So mixing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would create a buffer solution, right?\n\nSo the solution should involve calculating the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, then using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, and then determine the concentration of PO4^3- from that.\n\nWait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, or is it PO4^3-? Hmm, maybe I should double-check. I think orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people refer to different forms. Let me think. H3PO4 is the acid, which can lose three protons. The first deprotonation gives H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), the second gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and the third gives PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So in this case, the solution contains KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O (which is HPO4^2-). So when these are mixed, they form a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-? Or maybe the question refers to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate? Hmm, I'm a bit unsure. Let me look that up mentally. Oh, right, the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-; HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate. So in this solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but the orthophosphate concentration would be the PO4^3- part, which is minimal because it's the third dissociation step.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the species in solution. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (since it's a salt). Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water of crystallization, but in solution, the HPO4^2- is the main species. So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nSince both are present, this is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, considering the second dissociation constant, since H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. Wait, no: the first dissociation is H3PO4 \u21cc H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1=7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12).\n\nSo when you have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, their ratio would relate to the second dissociation constant. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nOnce we find the pH, we can then find the concentration of PO4^3- from the third dissociation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- first, then find the concentrations of other species.\n\nWait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I thought is PO4^3-. So perhaps I need to find [PO4^3-].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-, but I'm not sure. Let me read the question again. It says, \"the concentration of orthophosphate ions.\" Hmm. Maybe in this context, orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps I should proceed as if it's PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate is H3PO4, but that doesn't make sense in solution because it's a weak acid and would mostly dissociate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify the terms. Let me think: Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. When it dissociates, the first step gives H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), the second gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and the third gives PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the name \"orthophosphate\" refers to the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.\n\nSo in this problem, I'm to find the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n2. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with Ka2 to find the pH.\n3. Use the Ka3 expression to find [PO4^3-] based on [HPO4^2-] and the pH.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the third dissociation step to find PO4^3- concentration. But to get that, I need to know [HPO4^2-], which I can find from the initial amounts, but wait, because the solution may have some of HPO4^2- dissociating into PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n\nThe solution has 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters.\n\nKH2PO4: 1 gram. Its molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007337 mol. Since it dissociates into one H2PO4^- ion, concentration is 0.007337 / 0.2 = 0.036685 M.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1 gram. Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005617 mol. Each mole gives one HPO4^2- ion, so concentration is 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M.\n\nSo initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.036685 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M.\n\nNow, because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to form HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose a proton to form PO4^3-, but the third dissociation is very weak (Ka3 is 1.8e-12), which is much smaller than Ka2 (6.2e-8), so the concentration of PO4^3- will be very low.\n\nBut first, let's find the pH of the solution. Since we have a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with Ka2.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\npKa2 is log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.208.\n\nSo pH = 7.208 + log(0.028085 / 0.036685)\n\nLet me calculate the ratio: 0.028085 / 0.036685 \u2248 0.766.\n\nlog(0.766) \u2248 -0.113.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.208 - 0.113 = 7.095.\n\nSo pH is approximately 7.095.\n\nNow, to find the concentration of PO4^3-, we can use the third dissociation:\n\nHPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-\n\nThe expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.\n\nWe know [H+] is 10^-pH = 10^-7.095 \u2248 8.23e-8 M.\n\nSo rearranging for [PO4^3-], we get:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me double-check the expression. Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]. So solving for [PO4^3-], it's (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+].\n\nSo substituting the values:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M (initial concentration, but wait, does it change much? Well, since Ka3 is very small, the dissociation of HPO4^2- is minimal, so the concentration of HPO4^2- remains approximately the same as the initial, which is 0.028085 M. So we can use that.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.23e-8)\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 \u2248 5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.23e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] \u2248 5.0553e-14 / 8.23e-8 \u2248 6.14e-7 M.\n\nWait, but that's approximately 6.14e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option B is 5.48e-7, etc. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the pH step more accurately.\n\nThe ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.028085 / 0.036685.\n\nLet me compute that more precisely.\n\n0.028085 / 0.036685 \u2248 (28.085 / 36.685) \u2248 0.766.\n\nLog(0.766): Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nLog(0.766) is log(7.66e-1) = log(7.66) + log(10^-1) = 0.8847 -1 = -0.1153.\n\nSo pH = 7.208 - 0.1153 = 7.0927, which is about 7.093.\n\nSo [H+] is 10^-7.093 \u2248 8.20e-8.\n\nWait, 10^-7.093 = 10^(-7 -0.093) )= 10^-7 * 10^-0.093.\n\n10^-0.093 is approximately 0.823. So 8.23e-8.\n\nSo back to [PO4^3-]:\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.23e-8) \n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.23e-8: 5.0553e-14 / 8.23e-8 \u2248 6.143e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option A: 6.24e-7 M. Hmm, but my calculation is about 6.14e-7. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial concentrations. Let me recheck the moles.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. 1g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007337 mol.\n\nVolume is 200 cm\u00b3 = 0.2 L. So concentration is 0.007337 / 0.2 = 0.036685 M. Correct.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. 1g / 177.99 = 0.005617 mol. Concentration is 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M. Correct.\n\nSo the ratio is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or other factors, but I think the problem expects us to ignore that and proceed with the ideal solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach. Wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So the equation is correct.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps I should account for the dissociation of HPO4^2- when calculating the pH. But since Ka3 is so small (1.8e-12), the contribution to [H+] from HPO4^2- dissociation is negligible compared to the [H+] from the second dissociation. So the initial pH calculation using H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is accurate.\n\nWait, let me compute the [H+] from the third dissociation.\n\n[H+] from HPO4^2- dissociation: [H+] = sqrt( Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] )? Wait, no, because the third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nSo, for the third dissociation, let x be the concentration of PO4^3- formed.\n\nAt equilibrium, [HPO4^2-] \u2248 0.028085, [PO4^3-] = x, [H+] = 8.23e-8 (from the second dissociation).\n\nWait, but HPO4^2- can contribute to H+ via Ka3, but since [H+] is already determined as 8.23e-8, which is much higher than what HPO4^2- would contribute, the contribution is negligible. So the approximation holds.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct, giving [PO4^3-] \u22486.14e-7 M. But the options don't have exactly that value. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is close but a bit higher. Did I make a calculation mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the exact value more precisely.\n\nLet me recompute the [PO4^3-].\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M.\n\n[H+] = 8.23e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.23e-8).\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.23e-8.\n\n5.0553e-14 /8.23e-8 = (5.0553 /8.23 ) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553 /8.23 \u22480.614.\n\nSo 0.614e-6 = 6.14e-7 M.\n\nSo the calculation is about 6.14e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is about 0.01 higher. Hmm, perhaps I should check if I made a miscalculation in the ratio.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ratio. Let me re-calculate the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M.\n\n[H2PO4^-] is 0.036685 M.\n\n0.028085 /0.036685 = approximately 0.766.\n\nWait, exact division: 28085 / 36685.\n\nHmm, 28085 \u00f7 36685. Let me compute it.\n\nWell, 28085 \u00f7 36685 \u2248 0.766.\n\nWait, perhaps using a calculator would be better, but since I don't have one, perhaps I can use a more precise approximation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that the solution is not only a buffer but also to account for the fact that HPO4^2- can donate a proton, but given the Ka3 is so small, it's negligible.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for [HPO4^2-], which is one of the initial concentrations, but no, the question is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me recheck.\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\npKa2 is log(6.2e-8) = 7.2075.\n\nWait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 * 1e-8. log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.\n\nSo pH = 7.2076 + log(0.766) \u22487.2076 -0.1133 =7.0943.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^-7.0943 \u2248 8.20e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / 8.20e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.20e-8: 5.0553e-14 /8.20e-8 = (5.0553 /8.20 )e-6.\n\n5.0553 \u00f78.20 \u22480.6165.\n\nSo 0.6165e-6 =6.165e-7 M.\n\nHmm, that's about 6.16e-7, which is closer to 6.2e-7. But option A is 6.24e-7, which is about 0.03 higher.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider more precise calculation of the logarithm.\n\nLog(0.766) = log(766/1000) = log(766) -3.\n\nLog(766): log(700)=2.8451, log(766)= log(7.66e2)= 2 + log(7.66).\n\nlog(7.66)= 0.8847, so log(766)= 2.8847.\n\nSo log(0.766)= 2.8847 -3 = -0.1153.\n\nSo pH = 7.2076 -0.1153 =7.0923.\n\n[H+] = 10^-7.0923.\n\nCompute 10^-7.0923.\n\nWe know that 10^-7 =1e-7.\n\nThe exponent 0.0923 is the decimal part.\n\n10^-0.0923 = 1/(10^0.0923).\n\n10^0.0923 \u2248 1.238 (since 10^0.1\u22481.258, so 0.0923 is a bit less).\n\nSo 1/1.238 \u22480.807.\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 8.07e-8.\n\nNow, recompute [PO4^3-]:\n\n(1.8e-12 *0.028085) / (8.07e-8) = (5.0553e-14) / (8.07e-8) = 5.0553 /8.07 * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553/8.07 \u22480.6265.\n\nSo 0.6265e-6 =6.265e-7 M.\n\nAh, that's about 6.26e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7), but a bit higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation of [H+].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use exact values without approximations.\n\nAnother approach: let's compute the pH more accurately.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M.\n\n[H2PO4^-] =0.036685 M.\n\nTheir ratio is 0.028085 / 0.036685 = 0.7663.\n\nLog(0.7663) = ?\n\nUsing log table or calculator:\n\nLog(0.7663) = log(7.663e-1) = log(7.663) -1.\n\nLog(7.663) is approximately 0.8848.\n\nSo log(0.7663)= 0.8848 -1 = -0.1152.\n\nSo pH = pKa2 + (-0.1152) =7.2076 -0.1152=7.0924.\n\nNow, [H+] = 10^-7.0924.\n\n10^7.0924 = 10^7 *10^0.0924.\n\n10^0.0924 \u22481.237.\n\nSo 10^7.0924 =1.237e7 \u2192 [H+] = 1/(1.237e7) \u22488.08e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028085) / (8.08e-8) = (5.0553e-14) /8.08e-8.\n\n5.0553e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.0553 /8.08 ) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553 /8.08 \u22480.626.\n\nSo 0.626e-6 =6.26e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So probably the correct answer is option A.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- instead of PO4^3-.\n\nWait, that would be 0.028085 M, which is 2.8085e-2 M, which is way higher than any of the options. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about the total concentration of phosphate species. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution, considering any dissociation.\n\nWait, but no, the question is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers the second dissociation and the third, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the solution is prepared with a specific amount of water and the salts, but I think the volume is given as 200 cm\u00b3, so the concentrations are correct as calculated.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider that the solution's volume might change when the two salts are dissolved, but the problem states the volume is 200 cm\u00b3, so I think we can proceed with that.\n\nSo, based on the calculations, the concentration is approximately 6.26e-7 M, which is closest to option A: 6.24e-7 M.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is about half of what I'm getting. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about PO4^3-, but about HPO4^2-? No, the question says orthophosphate, which I thought is PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the solution as a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible, but the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but that's 0.028085 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, not matching any options. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- in the solution, but that's not the question.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of phosphate ions in the solution, which would include all species, but the question specifies orthophosphate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused about what orthophosphate refers to. Let me double-check:\n\nOrthophosphate is H3PO4. But when dissolved, it dissociates into H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the term orthophosphate ion refers to PO4^3-.\n\nSo the calculation I did should be correct.\n\nBut according to that, the concentration is approximately 6.26e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7), but perhaps due to rounding, it's exactly that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the exact value with more precise calculations.\n\nLet me compute [PO4^3-] again:\n\nKa3 =1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] =0.028085 M.\n\n[H+] =8.08e-8 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) /8.08e-8.\n\nCompute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.028085 =5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator:8.08e-8.\n\n5.0553e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.0553 /8.08) *1e-6.\n\n5.0553 \u00f78.08.\n\nLet me compute 5.0553 \u00f78.08.\n\n8.08 \u00d70.625=5.05. Because 8 \u00d70.625=5, and 0.08\u00d70.625=0.05, so total 5.05.\n\nSo 5.0553 \u00f78.08 = approximately 0.6255.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] =0.6255e-6 =6.255e-7 M.\n\nWhich is 6.255e-7 M, very close to option A (6.24e-7). So the correct answer should be option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is about half of that. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial concentrations.\n\nWait, wait: the problem says 1 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nWait, but wait, when Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is dissolved, each mole gives one HPO4^2-.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass calculation.\n\nWait, for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, the molar mass is Na:23 *2=46, HPO4: (H=1, P=31, O=16*4)=1+31+64=96. So 46 +96=142. Then plus 2 H2O: 2*(2+16)=36. So total molar mass is 142 +36=178 g/mol. Which matches the given Mw of 177.99, so that's correct.\n\nSo moles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 1g /177.99 g/mol \u22480.005617 mol. So correct.\n\nSo the initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M.\n\nSo the calculation is correct, leading to [PO4^3-]\u22486.25e-7 M.\n\nBut looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So perhaps that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but another possibility: perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH affects the [H+] used in the calculation, but I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ka3 expression. Let me recheck.\n\nKa3 is for HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nSo [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = Ka3.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct.\n\nHmm, but the given options don't have exactly 6.24e-7. Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without rounding.\n\nLet me compute the exact [PO4^3-]:\n\n(1.8e-12 *0.028085) / (8.08e-8) = ?\n\n1.8e-12 *0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\n5.0553e-14 /8.08e-8 = 5.0553/(8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553 /8.08 = 0.6256.\n\n0.6256e-6 =6.256e-7 M.\n\nSo the concentration is approximately 6.26e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So I think option A is the intended answer.\n\nWait, but in the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is about half of this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, not PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but that would be 0.028085 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, which is way higher than any options. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers the solution's ionic strength and activity coefficients, but I think the problem expects us to ignore that.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps I should consider the exact pH and not approximate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact value of [H+].\n\npH =7.0924 \u2192 [H+] =10^(-7.0924) = ?\n\nLet me compute 10^(-7.0924) accurately.\n\nLet me compute 10^(-7.0924) =1/(10^7.0924) =1/(10^7 * 10^0.0924).\n\n10^0.0924: Let me compute more accurately.\n\nWe know that 10^0.09 = approximately 1.228, and 10^0.0924 is a bit higher.\n\nLet me compute using logarithm tables or natural logs.\n\nUsing ln(10^x)=x ln(10). So ln(10^0.0924)=0.0924 * ln(10)=0.0924 * 2.302585\u22480.2129.\n\nSo 10^0.0924 = e^0.2129 \u2248 1.237.\n\nSo [H+] =1/(1.237e7) )=8.08e-8 M.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The calculation leads to approximately 6.24e-7 M, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is about 6.24e-7 divided by 1.57. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is [H2PO4^-]/[HPO4^2-], not the other way around. Let me check.\n\nWait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).\n\nIn this case, the base is HPO4^2-, and the acid is H2PO4^-.\n\nSo the ratio is [base]/[acid] = [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028085 /0.036685 \u22480.766.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the logarithm.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps I should compute the exact value of [PO4^3-] without any approximations.\n\nSo,\n\n[HPO4^2-] =0.028085 M.\n\n[H2PO4^-] =0.036685 M.\n\npH = pKa2 + log(0.028085/0.036685).\n\npKa2 = log(6.2e-8) =7.2075.\n\nlog(0.7663) = -0.1153.\n\npH=7.2075 -0.1153=7.0922.\n\n[H+]=10^-7.0922.\n\nCompute 10^-7.0922:\n\n10^7.0922 =10^7 *10^0.0922.\n\n10^0.0922: Let's compute it accurately.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series or a more precise method.\n\nAlternatively, using natural logs:\n\nln(10^0.0922) =0.0922 * ln(10) \u22480.0922 *2.302585\u22480.2123.\n\ne^0.2123 \u22481.2367.\n\nSo 10^0.0922\u22481.2367.\n\nSo 10^7.0922 =1.2367e7 \u2192 [H+] =1/(1.2367e7)=8.08e-8 M.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028085) /8.08e-8.\n\n= (5.0553e-14) /8.08e-8 = (5.0553 /8.08 ) *1e-6.\n\n5.0553 \u00f78.08: Let me compute this precisely.\n\n8.08 \u00d70.625 =5.05.\n\n5.0553 -5.05=0.0053.\n\nSo 0.0053 /8.08 \u22480.000656.\n\nSo 0.625 +0.000656\u22480.625656.\n\nSo 0.625656e-6=6.25656e-7 M.\n\nSo approximately 6.2566e-7 M.\n\nWhich is 6.2566e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and figure out what I need to do. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Both are 1 gram each in 200 cm\u00b3 of solution. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. \n\nWait, orthophosphate ions are PO4^3- right? Or wait, sometimes orthophosphate is HPO4^2-? I think orthophosphate is H3PO4, but wait, no, in solution, H3PO4 dissociates. Let me think. Oh, right, the various species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it's in solution, it can lose protons. So in this problem, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. \n\nI remember that when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can get a buffer solution. Since KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (which is a weak acid, since H3PO4 is a triprotic acid), and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (the conjugate base of H2PO4^-). So mixing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would create a buffer solution, right?\n\nSo the solution should involve calculating the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, then using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, and then determine the concentration of PO4^3- from that.\n\nWait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, or is it PO4^3-? Hmm, maybe I should double-check. I think orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people refer to different forms. Let me think. H3PO4 is the acid, which can lose three protons. The first deprotonation gives H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), the second gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and the third gives PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So in this case, the solution contains KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O (which is HPO4^2-). So when these are mixed, they form a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-? Or maybe the question refers to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate? Hmm, I'm a bit unsure. Let me look that up mentally. Oh, right, the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-; HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate. So in this solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but the orthophosphate concentration would be the PO4^3- part, which is minimal because it's the third dissociation step.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the species in solution. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (since it's a salt). Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water of crystallization, but in solution, the HPO4^2- is the main species. So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nSince both are present, this is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, considering the second dissociation constant, since H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. Wait, no: the first dissociation is H3PO4 \u21cc H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1=7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12).\n\nSo when you have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, their ratio would relate to the second dissociation constant. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nOnce we find the pH, we can then find the concentration of PO4^3- from the third dissociation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- first, then find the concentrations of other species.\n\nWait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I thought is PO4^3-. So perhaps I need to find [PO4^3-].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-, but I'm not sure. Let me read the question again. It says, \"the concentration of orthophosphate ions.\" Hmm. Maybe in this context, orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps I should proceed as if it's PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate is H3PO4, but that doesn't make sense in solution because it's a weak acid and would mostly dissociate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify the terms. Let me think: Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. When it dissociates, the first step gives H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), the second gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and the third gives PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the name \"orthophosphate\" refers to the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.\n\nSo in this problem, I'm to find the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n2. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with Ka2 to find the pH.\n3. Use the Ka3 expression to find [PO4^3-] based on [HPO4^2-] and the pH.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the third dissociation step to find PO4^3- concentration. But to get that, I need to know [HPO4^2-], which I can find from the initial amounts, but wait, because the solution may have some of HPO4^2- dissociating into PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n\nThe solution has 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters.\n\nKH2PO4: 1 gram. Its molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007337 mol. Since it dissociates into one H2PO4^- ion, concentration is 0.007337 / 0.2 = 0.036685 M.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1 gram. Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005617 mol. Each mole gives one HPO4^2- ion, so concentration is 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M.\n\nSo initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.036685 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M.\n\nNow, because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to form HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose a proton to form PO4^3-, but the third dissociation is very weak (Ka3 is 1.8e-12), which is much smaller than Ka2 (6.2e-8), so the concentration of PO4^3- will be very low.\n\nBut first, let's find the pH of the solution. Since we have a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with Ka2.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\npKa2 is log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.208.\n\nSo pH = 7.208 + log(0.028085 / 0.036685)\n\nLet me calculate the ratio: 0.028085 / 0.036685 \u2248 0.766.\n\nlog(0.766) \u2248 -0.113.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.208 - 0.113 = 7.095.\n\nSo pH is approximately 7.095.\n\nNow, to find the concentration of PO4^3-, we can use the third dissociation:\n\nHPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-\n\nThe expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.\n\nWe know [H+] is 10^-pH = 10^-7.095 \u2248 8.23e-8 M.\n\nSo rearranging for [PO4^3-], we get:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me double-check the expression. Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]. So solving for [PO4^3-], it's (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+].\n\nSo substituting the values:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M (initial concentration, but wait, does it change much? Well, since Ka3 is very small, the dissociation of HPO4^2- is minimal, so the concentration of HPO4^2- remains approximately the same as the initial, which is 0.028085 M. So we can use that.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.23e-8)\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 \u2248 5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.23e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] \u2248 5.0553e-14 / 8.23e-8 \u2248 6.14e-7 M.\n\nWait, but that's approximately 6.14e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option B is 5.48e-7, etc. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the pH step more accurately.\n\nThe ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.028085 / 0.036685.\n\nLet me compute that more precisely.\n\n0.028085 / 0.036685 \u2248 (28.085 / 36.685) \u2248 0.766.\n\nLog(0.766): Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nLog(0.766) is log(7.66e-1) = log(7.66) + log(10^-1) = 0.8847 -1 = -0.1153.\n\nSo pH = 7.208 - 0.1153 = 7.0927, which is about 7.093.\n\nSo [H+] is 10^-7.093 \u2248 8.20e-8.\n\nWait, 10^-7.093 = 10^(-7 -0.093) )= 10^-7 * 10^-0.093.\n\n10^-0.093 is approximately 0.823. So 8.23e-8.\n\nSo back to [PO4^3-]:\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.23e-8) \n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.23e-8: 5.0553e-14 / 8.23e-8 \u2248 6.143e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option A: 6.24e-7 M. Hmm, but my calculation is about 6.14e-7. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial concentrations. Let me recheck the moles.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. 1g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007337 mol.\n\nVolume is 200 cm\u00b3 = 0.2 L. So concentration is 0.007337 / 0.2 = 0.036685 M. Correct.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. 1g / 177.99 = 0.005617 mol. Concentration is 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M. Correct.\n\nSo the ratio is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or other factors, but I think the problem expects us to ignore that and proceed with the ideal solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach. Wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So the equation is correct.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps I should account for the dissociation of HPO4^2- when calculating the pH. But since Ka3 is so small (1.8e-12), the contribution to [H+] from HPO4^2- dissociation is negligible compared to the [H+] from the second dissociation. So the initial pH calculation using H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is accurate.\n\nWait, let me compute the [H+] from the third dissociation.\n\n[H+] from HPO4^2- dissociation: [H+] = sqrt( Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] )? Wait, no, because the third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nSo, for the third dissociation, let x be the concentration of PO4^3- formed.\n\nAt equilibrium, [HPO4^2-] \u2248 0.028085, [PO4^3-] = x, [H+] = 8.23e-8 (from the second dissociation).\n\nWait, but HPO4^2- can contribute to H+ via Ka3, but since [H+] is already determined as 8.23e-8, which is much higher than what HPO4^2- would contribute, the contribution is negligible. So the approximation holds.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct, giving [PO4^3-] \u22486.14e-7 M. But the options don't have exactly that value. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is close but a bit higher. Did I make a calculation mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the exact value more precisely.\n\nLet me recompute the [PO4^3-].\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M.\n\n[H+] = 8.23e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.23e-8).\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.23e-8.\n\n5.0553e-14 /8.23e-8 = (5.0553 /8.23 ) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553 /8.23 \u22480.614.\n\nSo 0.614e-6 = 6.14e-7 M.\n\nSo the calculation is about 6.14e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is about 0.01 higher. Hmm, perhaps I should check if I made a miscalculation in the ratio.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ratio. Let me re-calculate the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M.\n\n[H2PO4^-] is 0.036685 M.\n\n0.028085 /0.036685 = approximately 0.766.\n\nWait, exact division: 28085 / 36685.\n\nHmm, 28085 \u00f7 36685. Let me compute it.\n\nWell, 28085 \u00f7 36685 \u2248 0.766.\n\nWait, perhaps using a calculator would be better, but since I don't have one, perhaps I can use a more precise approximation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that the solution is not only a buffer but also to account for the fact that HPO4^2- can donate a proton, but given the Ka3 is so small, it's negligible.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for [HPO4^2-], which is one of the initial concentrations, but no, the question is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me recheck.\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\npKa2 is log(6.2e-8) = 7.2075.\n\nWait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 * 1e-8. log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.\n\nSo pH = 7.2076 + log(0.766) \u22487.2076 -0.1133 =7.0943.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^-7.0943 \u2248 8.20e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / 8.20e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.20e-8: 5.0553e-14 /8.20e-8 = (5.0553 /8.20 )e-6.\n\n5.0553 \u00f78.20 \u22480.6165.\n\nSo 0.6165e-6 =6.165e-7 M.\n\nHmm, that's about 6.16e-7, which is closer to 6.2e-7. But option A is 6.24e-7, which is about 0.03 higher.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider more precise calculation of the logarithm.\n\nLog(0.766) = log(766/1000) = log(766) -3.\n\nLog(766): log(700)=2.8451, log(766)= log(7.66e2)= 2 + log(7.66).\n\nlog(7.66)= 0.8847, so log(766)= 2.8847.\n\nSo log(0.766)= 2.8847 -3 = -0.1153.\n\nSo pH = 7.2076 -0.1153 =7.0923.\n\n[H+] = 10^-7.0923.\n\nCompute 10^-7.0923.\n\nWe know that 10^-7 =1e-7.\n\nThe exponent 0.0923 is the decimal part.\n\n10^-0.0923 = 1/(10^0.0923).\n\n10^0.0923 \u2248 1.238 (since 10^0.1\u22481.258, so 0.0923 is a bit less).\n\nSo 1/1.238 \u22480.807.\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 8.07e-8.\n\nNow, recompute [PO4^3-]:\n\n(1.8e-12 *0.028085) / (8.07e-8) = (5.0553e-14) / (8.07e-8) = 5.0553 /8.07 * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553/8.07 \u22480.6265.\n\nSo 0.6265e-6 =6.265e-7 M.\n\nAh, that's about 6.26e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7), but a bit higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation of [H+].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use exact values without approximations.\n\nAnother approach: let's compute the pH more accurately.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M.\n\n[H2PO4^-] =0.036685 M.\n\nTheir ratio is 0.028085 / 0.036685 = 0.7663.\n\nLog(0.7663) = ?\n\nUsing log table or calculator:\n\nLog(0.7663) = log(7.663e-1) = log(7.663) -1.\n\nLog(7.663) is approximately 0.8848.\n\nSo log(0.7663)= 0.8848 -1 = -0.1152.\n\nSo pH = pKa2 + (-0.1152) =7.2076 -0.1152=7.0924.\n\nNow, [H+] = 10^-7.0924.\n\n10^7.0924 = 10^7 *10^0.0924.\n\n10^0.0924 \u22481.237.\n\nSo 10^7.0924 =1.237e7 \u2192 [H+] = 1/(1.237e7) \u22488.08e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028085) / (8.08e-8) = (5.0553e-14) /8.08e-8.\n\n5.0553e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.0553 /8.08 ) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553 /8.08 \u22480.626.\n\nSo 0.626e-6 =6.26e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So probably the correct answer is option A.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- instead of PO4^3-.\n\nWait, that would be 0.028085 M, which is 2.8085e-2 M, which is way higher than any of the options. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about the total concentration of phosphate species. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution, considering any dissociation.\n\nWait, but no, the question is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers the second dissociation and the third, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the solution is prepared with a specific amount of water and the salts, but I think the volume is given as 200 cm\u00b3, so the concentrations are correct as calculated.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider that the solution's volume might change when the two salts are dissolved, but the problem states the volume is 200 cm\u00b3, so I think we can proceed with that.\n\nSo, based on the calculations, the concentration is approximately 6.26e-7 M, which is closest to option A: 6.24e-7 M.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is about half of what I'm getting. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about PO4^3-, but about HPO4^2-? No, the question says orthophosphate, which I thought is PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the solution as a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible, but the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but that's 0.028085 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, not matching any options. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- in the solution, but that's not the question.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of phosphate ions in the solution, which would include all species, but the question specifies orthophosphate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused about what orthophosphate refers to. Let me double-check:\n\nOrthophosphate is H3PO4. But when dissolved, it dissociates into H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the term orthophosphate ion refers to PO4^3-.\n\nSo the calculation I did should be correct.\n\nBut according to that, the concentration is approximately 6.26e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7), but perhaps due to rounding, it's exactly that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the exact value with more precise calculations.\n\nLet me compute [PO4^3-] again:\n\nKa3 =1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] =0.028085 M.\n\n[H+] =8.08e-8 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) /8.08e-8.\n\nCompute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.028085 =5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator:8.08e-8.\n\n5.0553e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.0553 /8.08) *1e-6.\n\n5.0553 \u00f78.08.\n\nLet me compute 5.0553 \u00f78.08.\n\n8.08 \u00d70.625=5.05. Because 8 \u00d70.625=5, and 0.08\u00d70.625=0.05, so total 5.05.\n\nSo 5.0553 \u00f78.08 = approximately 0.6255.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] =0.6255e-6 =6.255e-7 M.\n\nWhich is 6.255e-7 M, very close to option A (6.24e-7). So the correct answer should be option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is about half of that. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial concentrations.\n\nWait, wait: the problem says 1 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nWait, but wait, when Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is dissolved, each mole gives one HPO4^2-.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass calculation.\n\nWait, for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, the molar mass is Na:23 *2=46, HPO4: (H=1, P=31, O=16*4)=1+31+64=96. So 46 +96=142. Then plus 2 H2O: 2*(2+16)=36. So total molar mass is 142 +36=178 g/mol. Which matches the given Mw of 177.99, so that's correct.\n\nSo moles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 1g /177.99 g/mol \u22480.005617 mol. So correct.\n\nSo the initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M.\n\nSo the calculation is correct, leading to [PO4^3-]\u22486.25e-7 M.\n\nBut looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So perhaps that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but another possibility: perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH affects the [H+] used in the calculation, but I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ka3 expression. Let me recheck.\n\nKa3 is for HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nSo [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = Ka3.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct.\n\nHmm, but the given options don't have exactly 6.24e-7. Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without rounding.\n\nLet me compute the exact [PO4^3-]:\n\n(1.8e-12 *0.028085) / (8.08e-8) = ?\n\n1.8e-12 *0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\n5.0553e-14 /8.08e-8 = 5.0553/(8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553 /8.08 = 0.6256.\n\n0.6256e-6 =6.256e-7 M.\n\nSo the concentration is approximately 6.26e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So I think option A is the intended answer.\n\nWait, but in the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is about half of this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, not PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but that would be 0.028085 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, which is way higher than any options. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers the solution's ionic strength and activity coefficients, but I think the problem expects us to ignore that.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps I should consider the exact pH and not approximate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact value of [H+].\n\npH =7.0924 \u2192 [H+] =10^(-7.0924) = ?\n\nLet me compute 10^(-7.0924) accurately.\n\nLet me compute 10^(-7.0924) =1/(10^7.0924) =1/(10^7 * 10^0.0924).\n\n10^0.0924: Let me compute more accurately.\n\nWe know that 10^0.09 = approximately 1.228, and 10^0.0924 is a bit higher.\n\nLet me compute using logarithm tables or natural logs.\n\nUsing ln(10^x)=x ln(10). So ln(10^0.0924)=0.0924 * ln(10)=0.0924 * 2.302585\u22480.2129.\n\nSo 10^0.0924 = e^0.2129 \u2248 1.237.\n\nSo [H+] =1/(1.237e7) )=8.08e-8 M.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The calculation leads to approximately 6.24e-7 M, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is about 6.24e-7 divided by 1.57. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is [H2PO4^-]/[HPO4^2-], not the other way around. Let me check.\n\nWait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).\n\nIn this case, the base is HPO4^2-, and the acid is H2PO4^-.\n\nSo the ratio is [base]/[acid] = [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028085 /0.036685 \u22480.766.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the logarithm.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps I should compute the exact value of [PO4^3-] without any approximations.\n\nSo,\n\n[HPO4^2-] =0.028085 M.\n\n[H2PO4^-] =0.036685 M.\n\npH = pKa2 + log(0.028085/0.036685).\n\npKa2 = log(6.2e-8) =7.2075.\n\nlog(0.7663) = -0.1153.\n\npH=7.2075 -0.1153=7.0922.\n\n[H+]=10^-7.0922.\n\nCompute 10^-7.0922:\n\n10^7.0922 =10^7 *10^0.0922.\n\n10^0.0922: Let's compute it accurately.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series or a more precise method.\n\nAlternatively, using natural logs:\n\nln(10^0.0922) =0.0922 * ln(10) \u22480.0922 *2.302585\u22480.2123.\n\ne^0.2123 \u22481.2367.\n\nSo 10^0.0922\u22481.2367.\n\nSo 10^7.0922 =1.2367e7 \u2192 [H+] =1/(1.2367e7)=8.08e-8 M.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028085) /8.08e-8.\n\n= (5.0553e-14) /8.08e-8 = (5.0553 /8.08 ) *1e-6.\n\n5.0553 \u00f78.08: Let me compute this precisely.\n\n8.08 \u00d70.625 =5.05.\n\n5.0553 -5.05=0.0053.\n\nSo 0.0053 /8.08 \u22480.000656.\n\nSo 0.625 +0.000656\u22480.625656.\n\nSo 0.625656e-6=6.25656e-7 M.\n\nSo approximately 6.2566e-7 M.\n\nWhich is 6.2566e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we analyze the given system. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH\u2082PO\u2084 and 1.00 g of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O in 200.00 cm\u00b3 (0.200 L). The dissociation of these salts introduces H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b into the solution, forming a buffer. The orthophosphate ion (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) is the fully deprotonated form of phosphoric acid (H\u2083PO\u2084), and its concentration can be calculated using the third dissociation constant, \\( K_a3 \\), and the pH of the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b\n- **KH\u2082PO\u2084**:  \n  Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol.  \n  Moles = \\( \\frac{1.00}{136.09} \\approx 0.007337 \\, \\text{mol} \\).  \n  Concentration = \\( \\frac{0.007337}{0.200} \\approx 0.036685 \\, \\text{M} \\).  \n\n- **Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O**:  \n  Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol.  \n  Moles = \\( \\frac{1.00}{177.99} \\approx 0.005617 \\, \\text{mol} \\).  \n  Concentration = \\( \\frac{0.005617}{0.200} \\approx 0.028085 \\, \\text{M} \\).  \n\nThus, the initial concentrations are:  \n\\[\n[H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b] = 0.036685 \\, \\text{M}, \\quad [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] = 0.028085 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH\nThe buffer consists of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b (acid) and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b (base).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3- right? The solution has two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, each weighing 1.00 g in 200 cm\u00b3 of solution. The temperatures are at 25\u00b0C, which I think is standard, so maybe some constants are known at that temperature.\n\nWait, the problem gives me the Ka values for H3PO4. They are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. I think those are the dissociation constants. So H3PO4 can lose protons stepwise.\n\nI remember that KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium phosphate dibasic with two waters of crystallization. So when these salts dissolve, they release certain phosphate species into the solution.\n\nLet me think. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- can act as an acid or a base. Similarly, Na2HPO4 would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So HPO4^2- can also act as an acid or a base.\n\nWait, the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Since these are conjugate acid-base pairs, the solution might be a buffer. Because when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid, you get a buffer solution. So in this case, H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in the same solution, which are each other's conjugate pairs. So this is a buffer system.\n\nThe pH of the solution will be determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Oh, right, because the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-.\n\nSo I need to find [PO4^3-] in the solution.\n\nBut wait, how? Because the main species present are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. PO4^3- is the deprotonated form, which is the last step of dissociation (Ka3). Since Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), the concentration of PO4^3- will be very low. So maybe I can calculate it using the third dissociation step.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n2. Determine the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n3. Use the buffer equation (Henderson-Hasselbalch) to find the pH.\n4. Then, use the third dissociation equation to find [PO4^3-].\n\nWait, but step 3 might not be necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the expression from the third dissociation. Since HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-.\n\nLet me get into the calculations.\n\nFirst, calculate moles.\n\nMolar mass (Mw) of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / Mw. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007346 mol. Let me compute that more accurately: 1 / 136.09 is approximately 0.007346.\n\nSimilarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O has Mw 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005612 mol.\n\nWait, let me compute that precisely:\n\n1.00 / 136.09 = 1/136.09 \u2248 0.007346 mol.\n\n1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005612 mol.\n\nSo the solution has 0.007346 moles of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and 0.005612 moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4).\n\nThe volume is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.200 liters.\n\nConcentration of H2PO4^-: 0.007346 / 0.2 = 0.03673 M.\n\nConcentration of HPO4^2-: 0.005612 / 0.2 = 0.02806 M.\n\nNow, since these are a conjugate acid-base pair (H2PO4^- is the acid, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base), the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nBut wait, which Ka do we use here? The Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).\n\nH2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (which is the base). So the relevant Ka is Ka2 (since Ka1 is H3PO4 losing a proton to become H2PO4^-, and Ka2 is H2PO4^- losing a proton to become HPO4^2-). Wait, no, wait. The second dissociation is H2PO4^- \u2194 HPO4^2- + H+. So the Ka for this step is Ka2 = 6.2e-8. So the pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.208.\n\nSo using the Henderson equation:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03673 M.\n\nRatio = 0.02806 / 0.03673 \u2248 0.764.\n\nLog(0.764) \u2248 -0.115.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.208 - 0.115 \u2248 7.093.\n\nWait, is that right? So the pH is around 7.09. But I'm not sure if I need the pH for the next part.\n\nWait, but the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions, which comes from the third dissociation step. HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3- and water.\n\nThe third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+.\n\nThe Ka3 for this step is 1.8e-12. So the expression for Ka3 is:\n\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-].\n\nI can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nBut I know [HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M. And [H+] can be found from the pH.\n\npH is 7.093, so [H+] = 10^(-7.093) \u2248 8.26e-8 M.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.26e-8).\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = approx 5.0508e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.26e-8.\n\nSo 5.0508e-14 / 8.26e-8 \u2248 6.116e-7 M.\n\nWait, wait, that's approximately 6.1e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the pH. Let me recalculate the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\npKa2 is log(6.2e-8) \u2192 let's compute it accurately. 6.2e-8 is 6.2 * 10^-8.\n\nlog(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.\n\nThe ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02806 / 0.03673 \u2248 0.764.\n\nLog(0.764) \u2192 Let me compute that. Log(0.7) is about -0.155, log(0.764) is a bit higher. Let me compute 10^-0.115 is about 0.764? Let me check with calculator steps.\n\nWait, using a calculator: 0.764. Let me compute log(0.764).\n\nLog(0.764) \u2248 log(7.64e-1) \u2192 log(7.64) is 0.8835, so log(7.64e-1) = 0.8835 -1 = -0.1165.\n\nSo the pH is 7.2076 + (-0.1165) = 7.0911.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^(-7.0911) \u2192 10^(-7) is 1e-7, 10^(-0.0911) \u2248 0.876.\n\nSo 1e-7 * 0.876 \u2248 8.76e-8 M.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 8.26e-8, but perhaps more accurately 8.76e-8.\n\nWait, let's compute 10^(-7.0911) more precisely.\n\n7.0911 can be split into 7 + 0.0911.\n\n10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.0911) is about 0.876 (since ln(0.876) \u2248 -0.134, and 0.0911 is about 0.134 in log? Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\nlog(8.76)= approx 0.943. Because 10^0.943 \u2248 8.76.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: 10^0.0911 \u2248 1.233 (since 10^0.1 is about 1.258, so 0.0911 is a bit less). So 10^(-0.0911) = 1/(10^0.0911) \u2248 1/1.233 \u2248 0.811.\n\nSo [H+] is 1e-7 * 0.811 \u2248 8.11e-8 M.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8.76e-8. Hmm, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, using pH=7.0911.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.0911) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0911).\n\n10^(-0.0911) is approximately equal to 0.876? Let's compute:\n\nUsing a calculator, 0.0911 in exponent: 10^0.0911 \u2248 1.233. So 10^(-0.0911)=1/1.233\u22480.811.\n\nSo [H+]=1e-7 * 0.811=8.11e-8 M.\n\nSo now, back to the calculation of [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M.\n\n[H+] is 8.11e-8 M.\n\nSo:\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.11e-8) \u2192 compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = approx 5.05e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.11e-8: 5.05e-14 /8.11e-8 = (5.05 /8.11) * 1e-6 \u2192 5.05/8.11\u22480.623.\n\nSo 0.623e-6 \u2192 6.23e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. That's very close.\n\nBut wait, another thought: when I calculated [H+], I used the pH from the buffer equation, which assumes that the only H+ comes from the H2PO4^- / HPO4^2- system. But in reality, the solution is in water, which has its own H+ concentration. However, since the pH is around 7.09, which is close to neutral, the contribution from water is negligible. So I think the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.23e-7 M, which matches option A.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB) 5.48x10^-7 M \n\nC) 2.81x10^-7 M\n\nD) 3.97x10^-7 M \n\nSo the correct answer should be A.\n",

Let me compute log(0.764).\n\nLog(0.764) \u2248 log(7.64e-1) \u2192 log(7.64) is 0.8835, so log(7.64e-1) = 0.8835 -1 = -0.1165.\n\nSo the pH is 7.2076 + (-0.1165) = 7.0911.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^(-7.0911) \u2192 10^(-7) is 1e-7, 10^(-0.0911) \u2248 0.876.\n\nSo 1e-7 * 0.876 \u2248 8.76e-8 M.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 8.26e-8, but perhaps more accurately 8.76e-8.\n\nWait, let's compute 10^(-7.0911) more precisely.\n\n7.0911 can be split into 7 + 0.0911.\n\n10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.0911) is about 0.876 (since ln(0.876) \u2248 -0.134, and 0.0911 is about 0.134 in log? Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\nlog(8.76)= approx 0.943. Because 10^0.943 \u2248 8.76.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: 10^0.0911 \u2248 1.233 (since 10^0.1 is about 1.258, so 0.0911 is a bit less). So 10^(-0.0911) = 1/(10^0.0911) \u2248 1/1.233 \u2248 0.811.\n\nSo [H+] is 1e-7 * 0.811 \u2248 8.11e-8 M.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8.76e-8. Hmm, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, using pH=7.0911.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.0911) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0911).\n\n10^(-0.0911) is approximately equal to 0.876? Let's compute:\n\nUsing a calculator, 0.0911 in exponent: 10^0.0911 \u2248 1.233. So 10^(-0.0911)=1/1.233\u22480.811.\n\nSo [H+]=1e-7 * 0.811=8.11e-8 M.\n\nSo now, back to the calculation of [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M.\n\n[H+] is 8.11e-8 M.\n\nSo:\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.11e-8) \u2192 compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = approx 5.05e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.11e-8: 5.05e-14 /8.11e-8 = (5.05 /8.11) * 1e-6 \u2192 5.05/8.11\u22480.623.\n\nSo 0.623e-6 \u2192 6.23e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. That's very close.\n\nBut wait, another thought: when I calculated [H+], I used the pH from the buffer equation, which assumes that the only H+ comes from the H2PO4^- / HPO4^2- system. But in reality, the solution is in water, which has its own H+ concentration. However, since the pH is around 7.09, which is close to neutral, the contribution from water is negligible. So I think the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.23e-7 M, which matches option A.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB) 5.48x10^-7 M \n\nC) 2.81x10^-7 M\n\nD) 3.97x10^-7 M \n\nSo the correct answer should be A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ([PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b]) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use the provided dissociation constants for H\u2083PO\u2084. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH\u2082PO\u2084 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) in 200.00 cm\u00b3 (0.200 L). The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Calculate moles of each salt:**\n   - Moles of KH\u2082PO\u2084 = \\( \\frac{1.00}{136.09} \\approx 0.007346 \\, \\text{mol} \\).\n   - Moles of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O = \\( \\frac{1.00}{177.99} \\approx 0.005612 \\, \\text{mol} \\).\n\n2. **Determine concentrations in the solution:**\n   - Concentration of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b = \\( \\frac{0.007346}{0.200} \\approx 0.03673 \\, \\text{M} \\).\n   - Concentration of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b = \\( \\frac{0.005612}{0.200} \\approx 0.02806 \\, \\text{M} \\).\n\n3. **Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:**\n   - The relevant dissociation is \\( \\text{H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b} \\leftrightarrow \\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b} + \\text{H\u207a} \\), with \\( K_a = 6.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\).\n   - \\( pK_a = -\\log(6.2 \\times 10^{-8}) \\approx 7.208 \\).\n   - \\( \\text{pH} = pK_a + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b}]}{[\\text{H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b}]}\\right) \\).\n   - \\( \\text{pH} = 7.208 + \\log\\left(\\frac{0.02806}{0.03673}\\right) \\).\n   - \\( \\frac{0.02806}{0.03673} \\approx 0.764 \\), and \\( \\log(0.764) \\approx -0.116 \\).\n   - \\( \\text{pH} \\approx 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate [H\u207a] from the pH:**\n   - \\( [\\text{H\u207a}] = 10^{-\\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \\approx 8.11 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{M} \\).\n\n5. **Use the third dissociation to find [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b]:**\n   - The relevant dissociation is \\( \\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b} \\leftrightarrow \\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b} + \\text{H\u207a} \\), with \\( K_a = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12} \\).\n   - \\( K_a = \\frac{[\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}][\\text{H\u207a}]}{[\\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b}]} \\).\n   - Rearranging, \\( [\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}] = \\frac{K_a \\cdot [\\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b}]}{[\\text{H\u207a}]} \\).\n   - Substituting values:\n     \\[\n     [\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}] = \\frac{(1.8 \\times 10^{-12}) \\cdot (0.02806)}{8.11 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx \\frac{5.05 \\times 10^{-14}}{8.11 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 6.23 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M}.\n     \\]\n\n6. **Compare with the options:**\n   - The calculated concentration \\( [\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}] \\approx 6.23 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M} \\) matches option A.\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Hmm, I remember that phosphate ions can exist in different forms depending on the pH of the solution, so I think I'll need to consider the dissociation of H3PO4.\n\nFirst, the problem gives me the volumes and masses of the two compounds. The solution volume is 200.00 cm\u00b3, which I should convert to liters because molarity is in mol/L. So 200 cm\u00b3 is 0.2 liters.\n\nNext, I have 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. I need to find the molarity of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, I think orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but in solution, it can exist in different forms. Oh wait, no, wait. H3PO4 is the triprotic acid. So the species in solution depend on the pH. Let me think about the dissociation steps.\n\nH3PO4 dissociates in three steps:\n1. H3PO4 \u21cc H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)\n2. H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)\n3. HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)\n\nSo each step releases a proton. The problem is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, no. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? But in solution, the predominant form depends on the pH. Since the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, I think they form a buffer solution. Because KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (since it's K+ salt) and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (since it's Na+ salt). So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are conjugate acid-base pairs.\n\nWait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. So orthophosphate is PO4^3-? Or is HPO4^2- also considered orthophosphate? I think in this context, orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Maybe I should proceed.\n\nSo the first step is to calculate the moles of each salt in the solution. Let's start with KH2PO4. Its molar mass is given as 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass. 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.00734 mol. Since the volume is 0.2 L, the concentration is 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M. So [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M.\n\nNext, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 \u2248 0.00561 mol. Concentration is 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M. So [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.\n\nNow, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are the conjugate acid and base of the second dissociation step of H3PO4. The relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used here. The equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nWait, but wait, I'm supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Are we looking for [HPO4^2-], [PO4^3-], or the sum of both? The question specifies orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps in this context, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, because PO4^3- is more deprotonated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in solution, HPO4^2- can further dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. But since the solution is a buffer with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is determined by the ratio of these two, and PO4^3- is present in much lower concentration because Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), so it's negligible.\n\nSo, perhaps the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible. Therefore, the concentration of orthophosphate (maybe HPO4^2-) is what's being asked.\n\nWait, but the question says 'orthophosphate ions'. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? Because when you have H3PO4, each deprotonation gives H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, then PO4^3-. So the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, orthophosphate could refer to the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.\n\nHmm, but regardless, I think the main point here is that the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Once I find the pH, I can find the concentration of HPO4^2- and possibly PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the majority of phosphate is in the form of HPO4^2-, with a small amount of PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. I think orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Wait, phosphate ions can have different charges. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, and pyrophosphate is another form. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, no, the question says orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO4^3- because that's the most deprotonated form. But if the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is around the pKa2 of H3PO4, which is around 7.91 (since pKa2 is log(6.2e-8)= about 7.21? Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8. pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8))= log(1.61e7)= around 7.21. Wait, wait, no: pKa = -log(Ka). So for Ka2 = 6.2e-8, pKa2 = 7.208.\n\nSo the solution's pH is around 7.208 plus the log of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]. Let's calculate that ratio. [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M. So the ratio is 0.02805 / 0.0367 \u2248 0.764.\n\nSo log(0.764) \u2248 -0.114. So pH \u2248 7.208 - 0.114 \u2248 7.094.\n\nWait, but wait, the pH is around 7.1. Now, knowing that, can I find the concentration of PO4^3-? Because the solution is at pH 7.1, which is below pKa3 of H3PO4 (which is 12. something), so PO4^3- is not going to be a major species. But how much of it is present?\n\nWait, but wait. The solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is around 7.1. Now, to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, no, the question is about orthophosphate ions. So perhaps orthophosphate refers to PO4^3-.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think about the speciation of phosphate in the solution. At pH 7.1, which is lower than pKa3 (which is around 12), the majority of phosphate would be as HPO4^2- and some H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but wait, the presence of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- suggests that the pH is around pKa2, which is about 7.2. So, the solution is slightly acidic because the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is less than 1, meaning pH is less than pKa2.\n\nSo, at this pH, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because it's the third deprotonation, and the solution is way above its pKa3. Wait, no, the pKa3 is 12, so at pH 7.1, the solution is way below pKa3. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be minimal. Because HPO4^2- is in solution, and the pH is 7.1, which is much lower than 12, so the HPO4^2- would tend to pick up a proton to form H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with the initial assumption that the solution has HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. The solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. These are the sodium and potassium salts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, respectively.\n\nSo, when they dissolve in solution, they contribute H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. The solution will be a buffer solution, so the pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation using Ka2.\n\nSo, the pH is pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nAs I calculated before, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M. So, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] \u2248 0.764, so log(0.764) \u2248 -0.114.\n\nThus, pH = 7.208 - 0.114 \u2248 7.094.\n\nNow, considering that the pH is 7.094, and the pKa3 is about 12, which is much higher, so the solution is way below pKa3. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low, because most of the HPO4^2- is in the form of H2PO4^- at this pH.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right because the solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so at pH 7.09, which is just below pKa2, which is 7.208. So, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is about 0.764, meaning that H2PO4^- is more abundant.\n\nBut the problem is about orthophosphate ions. Hmm, perhaps orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, so the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02805 M. But wait, that's the initial concentration from the Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. But in solution, some of that HPO4^2- may convert to H2PO4^- due to the pH being lower than pKa2.\n\nWait, but no. Because the solution is buffered, the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are fixed by the amounts of the two salts added. So the buffer system is such that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M and [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M, regardless of the pH, because they are provided in specific amounts. Wait, but that's not correct because the actual concentrations will depend on the pH.\n\nWait, no, in a buffer solution, the concentrations are determined by the amounts added and the dissociation. So, in this case, when KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which is HPO4^2-) are dissolved, the solution will have these ions, but some of them will dissociate further based on the pH.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the phosphate species. The solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is PO4^3-, then in solution, the concentration would be determined by the third dissociation step.\n\nSo, the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the Ka3 expression.\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].\n\nWe can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+].\n\nWe know Ka3 is 1.8e-12. [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M. And [H+] can be found from the pH we calculated earlier, which was 7.094.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.094) \u2248 8.21e-8 M.\n\nSo, substituting the values:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.21e-8).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.02805 \u2248 5.049e-14.\n\nThen, divide by 8.21e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.21e-8 \u2248 6.148e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's approximately 6.15e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the pH calculation. Let me recheck.\n\npKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) = 7.208. [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805, [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367.\n\nSo the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02805 / 0.0367 \u2248 0.764. Log(0.764) is about -0.114.\n\nSo pH = 7.208 - 0.114 = 7.094. Correct.\n\nSo [H+] is 1e-7.094 \u2248 8.21e-8. Correct.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.21e-8) \u2248 (5.049e-14)/(8.21e-8) = approx 6.15e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7. That's close. But wait, perhaps my calculation has some approximation errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use exact values without rounding too much.\n\nLet me compute [PO4^3-] more accurately.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 1.8 * 0.02805 = 0.05049, so 0.05049e-12 = 5.049e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.21e-8.\n\nSo 5.049e-14 / 8.21e-8 = (5.049 / 8.21) * 1e-6.\n\n5.049 / 8.21 \u2248 0.615.\n\nSo 0.615e-6 = 6.15e-7 M.\n\nBut the options don't have 6.15e-7. The closest is option A:6.24e-7.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial concentrations. Let me recheck.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 /136.09 \u2248 0.00734 mol. Volume is 0.2 L, so 0.0367 M.\n\nMolar mass of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.00561 mol. 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer, and the pH is such that the concentration of PO4^3- is very low, but not zero.\n\nWait, but why are we considering PO4^3-? Because the question is about orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, then the concentration is 0.02805 M. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are all around 1e-7, which is much lower.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now. Let me think again. The question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO4^3-. So the concentration is 6.15e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) and option D (3.97e-7).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\npH = 7.094, so [H+] = 8.21e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.21e-8).\n\nLet me compute it again.\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 1.8 * 0.02805 = 0.05049 \u2192 5.049e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.21e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.21e-8 = 5.049 / 8.21 * 1e-6.\n\n5.049 /8.21 = 0.615 \u2192 0.615e-6 = 6.15e-7 M.\n\nSo that's 6.15e-7 M. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is A.\n\nBut wait, another approach: maybe the solution is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- and PO4^3- together, but I don't think that's the case. The question specifies orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total concentration of phosphate species. But the question isn't asking that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the solution more carefully. Let me think about the phosphate species at the given pH.\n\nAt pH 7.09, which is just below pKa2 (7.208), the predominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nThe third dissociation (HPO4^2- \u21cc PO4^3- + H+) is much less likely because pH is much lower than pKa3 (12). So the concentration of PO4^3- is very small.\n\nSo, the concentration of PO4^3- is (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nWhich we calculated as 6.15e-7 M. So the answer should be around 6.2e-7.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which matches.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the problem says the solution has 1.00 g of each salt. So the moles are 1.00/136.09 \u2248 0.00734 for KH2PO4, and 1.00/177.99 \u2248 0.00561 for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nSo in solution, [H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.\n\nSo, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02805 / 0.0367 \u2248 0.764.\n\npH = pKa2 + log(0.764) \u22487.208 - 0.114=7.094.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^(-7.094)= 8.21e-8.\n\nNow, the concentration of PO4^3- is (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805)/ (8.21e-8).\n\nLet me compute this more precisely.\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.\n\n5.049e-14 / 8.21e-8 = (5.049 / 8.21) * 1e-6.\n\n5.049 \u00f7 8.21 \u2248 0.615.\n\nSo 0.615e-6 = 6.15e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.15e-7. The options are:\n\nA)6.24e-7\n\nB)5.48e-7\n\nC)2.81e-7\n\nD)3.97e-7\n\nSo the closest is A)6.24e-7. But why the slight discrepancy? Perhaps due to more precise calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without rounding.\n\nLet me compute [HPO4^2-] = 1.00 /177.99 = 0.00561 mol.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 /0.2 =0.0367 M.\n\nRatio is 0.02805 /0.0367 = 0.764.\n\npH =7.208 + log(0.764).\n\nLog(0.764)= log(7.64e-1)= log(7.64) + log(1e-1)= 0.8839 -1= -0.1161.\n\nSo pH=7.208 -0.1161=7.0919.\n\nSo [H+]=10^(-7.0919)= 8.27e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-]= (1.8e-12 *0.02805)/(8.27e-8).\n\nCalculate numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02805 = 5.049e-14.\n\nDenominator:8.27e-8.\n\nSo 5.049e-14 /8.27e-8 = (5.049/8.27)*1e-6.\n\n5.049 /8.27 \u2248 0.6098.\n\nSo 0.6098e-6=6.098e-7.\n\nSo approximately 6.10e-7 M.\n\nWhich is close to option A's 6.24e-7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of [H+]. Let me compute 10^(-7.0919) more precisely.\n\npH =7.0919.\n\n10^(-7.0919) = 10^(-7) *10^(-0.0919).\n\n10^(-7)=1e-7=0.0000001.\n\n10^(-0.0919) \u2248 10^(-0.09)= approx 0.891.\n\nSo 0.0000001 * 0.891=8.91e-8.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 8.27e-8, but this is 8.91e-8.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 10^(-0.0919) more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\nlog(0.891)= -0.0501. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute 10^(-0.0919).\n\nWe can use the Taylor series or linear approximation, but perhaps it's easier to note that:\n\nln(10^x)=x ln(10). So, 10^x= e^(x ln(10)).\n\nx= -0.0919.\n\nln(10)=2.302585.\n\nSo x ln(10)= -0.0919 *2.302585 \u2248-0.2116.\n\ne^(-0.2116)=approx 0.808.\n\nWait, e^(-0.2116) is approximately 0.808.\n\nSo 10^(-0.0919)=approx 0.808.\n\nSo [H+]=1e-7 *0.808=8.08e-8.\n\nSo more accurately, [H+] is approximately 8.08e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02805)/(8.08e-8).\n\nCompute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02805=5.049e-14.\n\nDenominator:8.08e-8.\n\nSo 5.049e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.049/8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.049/8.08 \u22480.6247.\n\nSo 0.6247e-6=6.247e-7.\n\nAh, now that's 6.247e-7, which matches option A:6.24e-7.\n\nSo the correct answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Hmm, I remember that phosphate ions can exist in different forms depending on the pH of the solution, so I think I'll need to consider the dissociation of H3PO4.\n\nFirst, the problem gives me the volumes and masses of the two compounds. The solution volume is 200.00 cm\u00b3, which I should convert to liters because molarity is in mol/L. So 200 cm\u00b3 is 0.2 liters.\n\nNext, I have 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. I need to find the molarity of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, I think orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but in solution, it can exist in different forms. Oh wait, no, wait. H3PO4 is the triprotic acid. So the species in solution depend on the pH. Let me think about the dissociation steps.\n\nH3PO4 dissociates in three steps:\n1. H3PO4 \u21cc H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)\n2. H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)\n3. HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)\n\nSo each step releases a proton. The problem is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, no. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? But in solution, the predominant form depends on the pH. Since the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, I think they form a buffer solution. Because KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (since it's K+ salt) and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (since it's Na+ salt). So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are conjugate acid-base pairs.\n\nWait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. So orthophosphate is PO4^3-? Or is HPO4^2- also considered orthophosphate? I think in this context, orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Maybe I should proceed.\n\nSo the first step is to calculate the moles of each salt in the solution. Let's start with KH2PO4. Its molar mass is given as 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass. 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.00734 mol. Since the volume is 0.2 L, the concentration is 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M. So [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M.\n\nNext, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 \u2248 0.00561 mol. Concentration is 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M. So [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.\n\nNow, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are the conjugate acid and base of the second dissociation step of H3PO4. The relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used here. The equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nWait, but wait, I'm supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Are we looking for [HPO4^2-], [PO4^3-], or the sum of both? The question specifies orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps in this context, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, because PO4^3- is more deprotonated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in solution, HPO4^2- can further dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. But since the solution is a buffer with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is determined by the ratio of these two, and PO4^3- is present in much lower concentration because Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), so it's negligible.\n\nSo, perhaps the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible. Therefore, the concentration of orthophosphate (maybe HPO4^2-) is what's being asked.\n\nWait, but the question says 'orthophosphate ions'. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? Because when you have H3PO4, each deprotonation gives H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, then PO4^3-. So the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, orthophosphate could refer to the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.\n\nHmm, but regardless, I think the main point here is that the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Once I find the pH, I can find the concentration of HPO4^2- and possibly PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the majority of phosphate is in the form of HPO4^2-, with a small amount of PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. I think orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Wait, phosphate ions can have different charges. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, and pyrophosphate is another form. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, no, the question says orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO4^3- because that's the most deprotonated form. But if the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is around the pKa2 of H3PO4, which is around 7.91 (since pKa2 is log(6.2e-8)= about 7.21? Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8. pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8))= log(1.61e7)= around 7.21. Wait, wait, no: pKa = -log(Ka). So for Ka2 = 6.2e-8, pKa2 = 7.208.\n\nSo the solution's pH is around 7.208 plus the log of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]. Let's calculate that ratio. [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M. So the ratio is 0.02805 / 0.0367 \u2248 0.764.\n\nSo log(0.764) \u2248 -0.114. So pH \u2248 7.208 - 0.114 \u2248 7.094.\n\nWait, but wait, the pH is around 7.1. Now, knowing that, can I find the concentration of PO4^3-? Because the solution is at pH 7.1, which is below pKa3 of H3PO4 (which is 12. something), so PO4^3- is not going to be a major species. But how much of it is present?\n\nWait, but wait. The solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is around 7.1. Now, to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, no, the question is about orthophosphate ions. So perhaps orthophosphate refers to PO4^3-.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think about the speciation of phosphate in the solution. At pH 7.1, which is lower than pKa3 (which is around 12), the majority of phosphate would be as HPO4^2- and some H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but wait, the presence of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- suggests that the pH is around pKa2, which is about 7.2. So, the solution is slightly acidic because the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is less than 1, meaning pH is less than pKa2.\n\nSo, at this pH, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because it's the third deprotonation, and the solution is way above its pKa3. Wait, no, the pKa3 is 12, so at pH 7.1, the solution is way below pKa3. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be minimal. Because HPO4^2- is in solution, and the pH is 7.1, which is much lower than 12, so the HPO4^2- would tend to pick up a proton to form H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with the initial assumption that the solution has HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. The solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. These are the sodium and potassium salts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, respectively.\n\nSo, when they dissolve in solution, they contribute H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. The solution will be a buffer solution, so the pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation using Ka2.\n\nSo, the pH is pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nAs I calculated before, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M. So, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] \u2248 0.764, so log(0.764) \u2248 -0.114.\n\nThus, pH = 7.208 - 0.114 \u2248 7.094.\n\nNow, considering that the pH is 7.094, and the pKa3 is about 12, which is much higher, so the solution is way below pKa3. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low, because most of the HPO4^2- is in the form of H2PO4^- at this pH.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right because the solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so at pH 7.09, which is just below pKa2, which is 7.208. So, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is about 0.764, meaning that H2PO4^- is more abundant.\n\nBut the problem is about orthophosphate ions. Hmm, perhaps orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, so the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02805 M. But wait, that's the initial concentration from the Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. But in solution, some of that HPO4^2- may convert to H2PO4^- due to the pH being lower than pKa2.\n\nWait, but no. Because the solution is buffered, the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are fixed by the amounts of the two salts added. So the buffer system is such that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M and [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M, regardless of the pH, because they are provided in specific amounts. Wait, but that's not correct because the actual concentrations will depend on the pH.\n\nWait, no, in a buffer solution, the concentrations are determined by the amounts added and the dissociation. So, in this case, when KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which is HPO4^2-) are dissolved, the solution will have these ions, but some of them will dissociate further based on the pH.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the phosphate species. The solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is PO4^3-, then in solution, the concentration would be determined by the third dissociation step.\n\nSo, the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the Ka3 expression.\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].\n\nWe can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+].\n\nWe know Ka3 is 1.8e-12. [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M. And [H+] can be found from the pH we calculated earlier, which was 7.094.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.094) \u2248 8.21e-8 M.\n\nSo, substituting the values:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.21e-8).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.02805 \u2248 5.049e-14.\n\nThen, divide by 8.21e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.21e-8 \u2248 6.148e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's approximately 6.15e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the pH calculation. Let me recheck.\n\npKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) = 7.208. [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805, [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367.\n\nSo the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02805 / 0.0367 \u2248 0.764. Log(0.764) is about -0.114.\n\nSo pH = 7.208 - 0.114 = 7.094. Correct.\n\nSo [H+] is 1e-7.094 \u2248 8.21e-8. Correct.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.21e-8) \u2248 (5.049e-14)/(8.21e-8) = approx 6.15e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7. That's close. But wait, perhaps my calculation has some approximation errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use exact values without rounding too much.\n\nLet me compute [PO4^3-] more accurately.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 1.8 * 0.02805 = 0.05049, so 0.05049e-12 = 5.049e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.21e-8.\n\nSo 5.049e-14 / 8.21e-8 = (5.049 / 8.21) * 1e-6.\n\n5.049 / 8.21 \u2248 0.615.\n\nSo 0.615e-6 = 6.15e-7 M.\n\nBut the options don't have 6.15e-7. The closest is option A:6.24e-7.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial concentrations. Let me recheck.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 /136.09 \u2248 0.00734 mol. Volume is 0.2 L, so 0.0367 M.\n\nMolar mass of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.00561 mol. 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer, and the pH is such that the concentration of PO4^3- is very low, but not zero.\n\nWait, but why are we considering PO4^3-? Because the question is about orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, then the concentration is 0.02805 M. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are all around 1e-7, which is much lower.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now. Let me think again. The question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO4^3-. So the concentration is 6.15e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) and option D (3.97e-7).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\npH = 7.094, so [H+] = 8.21e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.21e-8).\n\nLet me compute it again.\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 1.8 * 0.02805 = 0.05049 \u2192 5.049e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.21e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.21e-8 = 5.049 / 8.21 * 1e-6.\n\n5.049 /8.21 = 0.615 \u2192 0.615e-6 = 6.15e-7 M.\n\nSo that's 6.15e-7 M. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is A.\n\nBut wait, another approach: maybe the solution is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- and PO4^3- together, but I don't think that's the case. The question specifies orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total concentration of phosphate species. But the question isn't asking that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the solution more carefully. Let me think about the phosphate species at the given pH.\n\nAt pH 7.09, which is just below pKa2 (7.208), the predominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nThe third dissociation (HPO4^2- \u21cc PO4^3- + H+) is much less likely because pH is much lower than pKa3 (12). So the concentration of PO4^3- is very small.\n\nSo, the concentration of PO4^3- is (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nWhich we calculated as 6.15e-7 M. So the answer should be around 6.2e-7.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which matches.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the problem says the solution has 1.00 g of each salt. So the moles are 1.00/136.09 \u2248 0.00734 for KH2PO4, and 1.00/177.99 \u2248 0.00561 for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nSo in solution, [H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.\n\nSo, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02805 / 0.0367 \u2248 0.764.\n\npH = pKa2 + log(0.764) \u22487.208 - 0.114=7.094.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^(-7.094)= 8.21e-8.\n\nNow, the concentration of PO4^3- is (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805)/ (8.21e-8).\n\nLet me compute this more precisely.\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.\n\n5.049e-14 / 8.21e-8 = (5.049 / 8.21) * 1e-6.\n\n5.049 \u00f7 8.21 \u2248 0.615.\n\nSo 0.615e-6 = 6.15e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.15e-7. The options are:\n\nA)6.24e-7\n\nB)5.48e-7\n\nC)2.81e-7\n\nD)3.97e-7\n\nSo the closest is A)6.24e-7. But why the slight discrepancy? Perhaps due to more precise calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without rounding.\n\nLet me compute [HPO4^2-] = 1.00 /177.99 = 0.00561 mol.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 /0.2 =0.0367 M.\n\nRatio is 0.02805 /0.0367 = 0.764.\n\npH =7.208 + log(0.764).\n\nLog(0.764)= log(7.64e-1)= log(7.64) + log(1e-1)= 0.8839 -1= -0.1161.\n\nSo pH=7.208 -0.1161=7.0919.\n\nSo [H+]=10^(-7.0919)= 8.27e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-]= (1.8e-12 *0.02805)/(8.27e-8).\n\nCalculate numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02805 = 5.049e-14.\n\nDenominator:8.27e-8.\n\nSo 5.049e-14 /8.27e-8 = (5.049/8.27)*1e-6.\n\n5.049 /8.27 \u2248 0.6098.\n\nSo 0.6098e-6=6.098e-7.\n\nSo approximately 6.10e-7 M.\n\nWhich is close to option A's 6.24e-7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of [H+]. Let me compute 10^(-7.0919) more precisely.\n\npH =7.0919.\n\n10^(-7.0919) = 10^(-7) *10^(-0.0919).\n\n10^(-7)=1e-7=0.0000001.\n\n10^(-0.0919) \u2248 10^(-0.09)= approx 0.891.\n\nSo 0.0000001 * 0.891=8.91e-8.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 8.27e-8, but this is 8.91e-8.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 10^(-0.0919) more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\nlog(0.891)= -0.0501. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute 10^(-0.0919).\n\nWe can use the Taylor series or linear approximation, but perhaps it's easier to note that:\n\nln(10^x)=x ln(10). So, 10^x= e^(x ln(10)).\n\nx= -0.0919.\n\nln(10)=2.302585.\n\nSo x ln(10)= -0.0919 *2.302585 \u2248-0.2116.\n\ne^(-0.2116)=approx 0.808.\n\nWait, e^(-0.2116) is approximately 0.808.\n\nSo 10^(-0.0919)=approx 0.808.\n\nSo [H+]=1e-7 *0.808=8.08e-8.\n\nSo more accurately, [H+] is approximately 8.08e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02805)/(8.08e-8).\n\nCompute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02805=5.049e-14.\n\nDenominator:8.08e-8.\n\nSo 5.049e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.049/8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.049/8.08 \u22480.6247.\n\nSo 0.6247e-6=6.247e-7.\n\nAh, now that's 6.247e-7, which matches option A:6.24e-7.\n\nSo the correct answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the given buffer system. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH\u2082PO\u2084 (molar mass = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O (molar mass = 177.99 g/mol) in a total volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3 (0.200 L).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because buffer solutions can be tricky. Let me take it step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, and we're asked to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.\n\nHmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-. Wait, but in solution, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The H3PO4 has three dissociation steps with given Ka values: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the phosphate ion is the deprotonated form, but I need to think about the buffer system here.\n\nLooking at the salts: KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. The other salt is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, which is sodium phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it should give Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait a second, I remember that H2PO4^- can act as both an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) and a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). But in this solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-\u2014so this is a buffer solution. The buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are the second and third dissociation steps. So, the relevant Ka would be Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.\n\nWait, no, wait. The buffer is between H2PO4^- (which can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-) and HPO4^2- (which can lose another proton to become PO4^3-). But in this case, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So, the buffer is between the second and third dissociation steps? Or the first and second?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The first dissociation is H3PO4 \u2192 H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- \u2192 HPO4^2- + H+. The third is HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3- + H+. So, in this buffer, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; that's the second and third forms. So the relevant Ka is Ka2 because that's the equilibrium between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but wait. The presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that the solution is a buffer system involving these two. So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the third dissociation product. So, how does that fit in? Hmm. Because in the solution, HPO4^2- can further dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. But the concentration of PO4^3- will depend on the pH of the solution, which we can find using the buffer equation.\n\nWait, so the plan is: first, find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution. Then, use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. With the pH known, we can then find the concentration of PO4^3- using the Ka3 expression.\n\nLet me break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the moles of each salt.\n\nFor KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight is 136.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles = mass / MW = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007334 mol. Since the formula is K(H2PO4), each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: mass is 1.00 g, MW is 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005613 mol. The formula is Na2(HPO4)\u00b72H2O, so each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007334 mol, and moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005613 mol.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the concentrations in the solution (volume 0.2 L).\n\nConcentration of H2PO4^-: 0.007334 / 0.2 = 0.03667 M.\n\nConcentration of HPO4^2-: 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.\n\nStep 3: Use Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.\n\nThe relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So, pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = ?\n\nWait, pKa is the negative log of Ka. So, pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.208 (since log(6.2)=0.792, so 7.208).\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nPlugging in the values: pH = 7.208 + log(0.028065 / 0.03667)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.028065 / 0.03667 \u2248 0.766.\n\nLog(0.766) is approximately -0.114 (since 10^-0.114 \u2248 0.766).\n\nSo, pH \u2248 7.208 - 0.114 = 7.094.\n\nStep 4: Now, find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nPO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-: HPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+.\n\nThe Ka for this dissociation is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. So, the expression for Ka3 is:\n\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe need to find [PO4^3-]. We have Ka3 and [H+] from the pH. Let's compute [H+].\n\n[H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.094) \u2248 8.29e-8 M.\n\nSo, rearranging the Ka3 expression:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M\n[H+] = 8.29e-8\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.29e-8)\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 \u2248 5.0517e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.29e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0517e-14 / 8.29e-8 \u2248 (5.0517 / 8.29) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.609 * 1e-6 \u2248 6.09e-7 M.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = ?\n\n1.8 * 0.028065 \u2248 0.050517, so 0.050517e-12 \u2192 5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.29e-8: 5.0517e-14 / 8.29e-8 = (5.0517 /8.29) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 \u00f78.29 \u2248 0.609. So, 0.609e-6 = 6.09e-7 M.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, but wait. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the calculations.\n\nLet me redo the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.\n\npKa2 is 7.208.\n\nRatio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028065 / 0.03667 \u2248 0.766.\n\nLog(0.766) is approximately log(3/4) \u2192 log(0.75)=\u22120.1249. Wait, I thought it was -0.114, but perhaps more accurate calculation is needed.\n\nLet me compute 0.028065 / 0.03667 = 0.766.\n\nCalculating log(0.766): Let's see. Log(0.7) is about -0.1549, log(0.8)=\u22120.0969. 0.766 is between 0.7 and 0.8, closer to 0.75.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approximation.\n\nUsing log(0.766) = ln(0.766)/ln(10) \u2248 (-0.266)/2.3026 \u2248 -0.1155.\n\nSo pH = 7.208 - 0.1155 \u2248 7.0925.\n\nSo [H+] is 10^(-7.0925) = ?\n\n10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.0925) is approximately 10^(-0.09)= ~0.812. So 1e-7 * 0.812 \u2248 8.12e-8. Close to my earlier estimate of 8.29e-8.\n\nSo [H+] is roughly 8.12e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nSo,\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.12e-8.\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517, so 0.050517e-12 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.12e-8: 5.0517e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.0517/8.12) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 /8.12 \u2248 0.622. So 0.622e-6 = 6.22e-7 M.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because when I calculated earlier, I got about 6.09e-7, but this time it's 6.22e-7. That's a small discrepancy, perhaps due to more precise calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.\n\nLet me compute [H+] more precisely. pH =7.0925 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-7.0925).\n\nCompute 7.0925: 7 + 0.0925. 10^(-7) is 1e-7, 10^(-0.0925) = ?\n\nUsing natural logs:\n\nln(10^(-0.0925)) = -0.0925 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.0925 * 2.302585 \u2248 -0.213.\n\nSo 10^(-0.0925)= e^(-0.213) \u2248 0.808.\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 1e-7 * 0.808 = 8.08e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.08e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.08e-8.\n\nSo 5.0517e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.0517 /8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 \u00f78.08 \u2248 0.6256.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] \u2248 0.6256e-6 = 6.256e-7 M.\n\nThat's about 6.26e-7 M, which is very close to option A, which is 6.24e-7 M.\n\nBut wait, the options also have option D as 3.97e-7 M. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in assuming that PO4^3- is the product of HPO4^2- dissociation? Or perhaps I should consider the total phosphate species?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it by considering the total concentration of phosphate species and using the third dissociation.\n\nWait, another approach: The solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nIn solution, the phosphate can exist as H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, and the hydroxide form. But since the pH is around 7.09, which is just above the pKa2 of 7.208, so the pH is a bit lower than pKa2, meaning that H2PO4^- is more prevalent than HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but in our case, HPO4^2- is present in lower concentration than H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but wait, the pH is 7.09, which is slightly less than pKa2 (7.208). So according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, when pH < pKa, the concentration of the acid form (H2PO4^-) is higher than the base (HPO4^2-), which matches our initial concentrations.\n\nNow, the phosphate species in solution include H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But the major species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nBut the question asks for orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. So, we need to calculate the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but I think I did that already. So according to my calculation, it's about 6.24e-7 M, which is option A.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should consider the common ion effect from the buffer solution when calculating the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the third dissociation step's Ka, which is 1.8e-12.\n\nSo, let me write the expression again.\n\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWe have:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12,\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M,\n\n[H+] = 8.08e-8 M.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.08e-8\n\nCalculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = (1.8 * 0.028065) e-12 = 0.050517e-12 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.08e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0517e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.0517 /8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 \u00f78.08 \u2248 0.625.\n\nSo, 0.625e-6 = 6.25e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.25e-7, very close to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nBut wait, none of the other options are close to that. So, I think option A is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA) 6.24e-7\nB) 5.48e-7\nC) 2.81e-7\nD) 3.97e-7\n\nSo, option A is 6.24e-7, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, another approach: perhaps I should consider the total concentration of phosphate ions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the buffer pH affects the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nWait, in the solution, the buffer system is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; the PO4^3- is a minor species because it's further dissociated. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low, but our calculation gives 6.24e-7, which is option A.\n\nBut why is option D 3.97e-7? Did I miscalculate something?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me recheck the moles.\n\nKH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007334 mol.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005613 mol.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nConcentrations:\n\nH2PO4^-: 0.007334 /0.2 = 0.03667 M.\n\nHPO4^2-: 0.005613 /0.2 = 0.028065 M.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\npKa2 = 7.208.\n\nRatio: 0.028065 /0.03667 \u2248 0.766.\n\nLog(0.766) \u2248 -0.114.\n\nSo, pH =7.208 - 0.114=7.094.\n\n[H+]=1e-7.094 \u2248 8.08e-8.\n\nThen, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.08e-8.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should calculate this more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 1.8e-12 * 0.028065.\n\n1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517.\n\nSo 0.050517e-12 =5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.08e-8:\n\n5.0517e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.0517 /8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 /8.08 = let's compute:\n\n8.08 * 0.625 = 5.05.\n\nSo 5.05 /8.08 =0.625.\n\nSo 5.0517e-14 /8.08e-8 = 0.625e-6 =6.25e-7 M.\n\nWhich is about 6.25e-7, matching option A (6.24e-7).\n\nSo I think the correct answer is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because buffer solutions can be tricky. Let me take it step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, and we're asked to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.\n\nHmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-. Wait, but in solution, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The H3PO4 has three dissociation steps with given Ka values: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the phosphate ion is the deprotonated form, but I need to think about the buffer system here.\n\nLooking at the salts: KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. The other salt is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, which is sodium phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it should give Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait a second, I remember that H2PO4^- can act as both an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) and a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). But in this solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-\u2014so this is a buffer solution. The buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are the second and third dissociation steps. So, the relevant Ka would be Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.\n\nWait, no, wait. The buffer is between H2PO4^- (which can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-) and HPO4^2- (which can lose another proton to become PO4^3-). But in this case, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So, the buffer is between the second and third dissociation steps? Or the first and second?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The first dissociation is H3PO4 \u2192 H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- \u2192 HPO4^2- + H+. The third is HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3- + H+. So, in this buffer, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; that's the second and third forms. So the relevant Ka is Ka2 because that's the equilibrium between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but wait. The presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that the solution is a buffer system involving these two. So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the third dissociation product. So, how does that fit in? Hmm. Because in the solution, HPO4^2- can further dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. But the concentration of PO4^3- will depend on the pH of the solution, which we can find using the buffer equation.\n\nWait, so the plan is: first, find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution. Then, use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. With the pH known, we can then find the concentration of PO4^3- using the Ka3 expression.\n\nLet me break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the moles of each salt.\n\nFor KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight is 136.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles = mass / MW = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007334 mol. Since the formula is K(H2PO4), each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: mass is 1.00 g, MW is 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005613 mol. The formula is Na2(HPO4)\u00b72H2O, so each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007334 mol, and moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005613 mol.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the concentrations in the solution (volume 0.2 L).\n\nConcentration of H2PO4^-: 0.007334 / 0.2 = 0.03667 M.\n\nConcentration of HPO4^2-: 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.\n\nStep 3: Use Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.\n\nThe relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So, pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = ?\n\nWait, pKa is the negative log of Ka. So, pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.208 (since log(6.2)=0.792, so 7.208).\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nPlugging in the values: pH = 7.208 + log(0.028065 / 0.03667)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.028065 / 0.03667 \u2248 0.766.\n\nLog(0.766) is approximately -0.114 (since 10^-0.114 \u2248 0.766).\n\nSo, pH \u2248 7.208 - 0.114 = 7.094.\n\nStep 4: Now, find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nPO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-: HPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+.\n\nThe Ka for this dissociation is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. So, the expression for Ka3 is:\n\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe need to find [PO4^3-]. We have Ka3 and [H+] from the pH. Let's compute [H+].\n\n[H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.094) \u2248 8.29e-8 M.\n\nSo, rearranging the Ka3 expression:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M\n[H+] = 8.29e-8\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.29e-8)\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 \u2248 5.0517e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.29e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0517e-14 / 8.29e-8 \u2248 (5.0517 / 8.29) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.609 * 1e-6 \u2248 6.09e-7 M.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = ?\n\n1.8 * 0.028065 \u2248 0.050517, so 0.050517e-12 \u2192 5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.29e-8: 5.0517e-14 / 8.29e-8 = (5.0517 /8.29) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 \u00f78.29 \u2248 0.609. So, 0.609e-6 = 6.09e-7 M.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, but wait. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the calculations.\n\nLet me redo the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.\n\npKa2 is 7.208.\n\nRatio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028065 / 0.03667 \u2248 0.766.\n\nLog(0.766) is approximately log(3/4) \u2192 log(0.75)=\u22120.1249. Wait, I thought it was -0.114, but perhaps more accurate calculation is needed.\n\nLet me compute 0.028065 / 0.03667 = 0.766.\n\nCalculating log(0.766): Let's see. Log(0.7) is about -0.1549, log(0.8)=\u22120.0969. 0.766 is between 0.7 and 0.8, closer to 0.75.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approximation.\n\nUsing log(0.766) = ln(0.766)/ln(10) \u2248 (-0.266)/2.3026 \u2248 -0.1155.\n\nSo pH = 7.208 - 0.1155 \u2248 7.0925.\n\nSo [H+] is 10^(-7.0925) = ?\n\n10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.0925) is approximately 10^(-0.09)= ~0.812. So 1e-7 * 0.812 \u2248 8.12e-8. Close to my earlier estimate of 8.29e-8.\n\nSo [H+] is roughly 8.12e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nSo,\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.12e-8.\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517, so 0.050517e-12 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.12e-8: 5.0517e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.0517/8.12) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 /8.12 \u2248 0.622. So 0.622e-6 = 6.22e-7 M.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because when I calculated earlier, I got about 6.09e-7, but this time it's 6.22e-7. That's a small discrepancy, perhaps due to more precise calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.\n\nLet me compute [H+] more precisely. pH =7.0925 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-7.0925).\n\nCompute 7.0925: 7 + 0.0925. 10^(-7) is 1e-7, 10^(-0.0925) = ?\n\nUsing natural logs:\n\nln(10^(-0.0925)) = -0.0925 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.0925 * 2.302585 \u2248 -0.213.\n\nSo 10^(-0.0925)= e^(-0.213) \u2248 0.808.\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 1e-7 * 0.808 = 8.08e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.08e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.08e-8.\n\nSo 5.0517e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.0517 /8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 \u00f78.08 \u2248 0.6256.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] \u2248 0.6256e-6 = 6.256e-7 M.\n\nThat's about 6.26e-7 M, which is very close to option A, which is 6.24e-7 M.\n\nBut wait, the options also have option D as 3.97e-7 M. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in assuming that PO4^3- is the product of HPO4^2- dissociation? Or perhaps I should consider the total phosphate species?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it by considering the total concentration of phosphate species and using the third dissociation.\n\nWait, another approach: The solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nIn solution, the phosphate can exist as H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, and the hydroxide form. But since the pH is around 7.09, which is just above the pKa2 of 7.208, so the pH is a bit lower than pKa2, meaning that H2PO4^- is more prevalent than HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but in our case, HPO4^2- is present in lower concentration than H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but wait, the pH is 7.09, which is slightly less than pKa2 (7.208). So according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, when pH < pKa, the concentration of the acid form (H2PO4^-) is higher than the base (HPO4^2-), which matches our initial concentrations.\n\nNow, the phosphate species in solution include H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But the major species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nBut the question asks for orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. So, we need to calculate the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but I think I did that already. So according to my calculation, it's about 6.24e-7 M, which is option A.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should consider the common ion effect from the buffer solution when calculating the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the third dissociation step's Ka, which is 1.8e-12.\n\nSo, let me write the expression again.\n\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWe have:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12,\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M,\n\n[H+] = 8.08e-8 M.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.08e-8\n\nCalculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = (1.8 * 0.028065) e-12 = 0.050517e-12 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.08e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0517e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.0517 /8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 \u00f78.08 \u2248 0.625.\n\nSo, 0.625e-6 = 6.25e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.25e-7, very close to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nBut wait, none of the other options are close to that. So, I think option A is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA) 6.24e-7\nB) 5.48e-7\nC) 2.81e-7\nD) 3.97e-7\n\nSo, option A is 6.24e-7, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, another approach: perhaps I should consider the total concentration of phosphate ions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the buffer pH affects the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nWait, in the solution, the buffer system is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; the PO4^3- is a minor species because it's further dissociated. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low, but our calculation gives 6.24e-7, which is option A.\n\nBut why is option D 3.97e-7? Did I miscalculate something?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me recheck the moles.\n\nKH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007334 mol.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005613 mol.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nConcentrations:\n\nH2PO4^-: 0.007334 /0.2 = 0.03667 M.\n\nHPO4^2-: 0.005613 /0.2 = 0.028065 M.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\npKa2 = 7.208.\n\nRatio: 0.028065 /0.03667 \u2248 0.766.\n\nLog(0.766) \u2248 -0.114.\n\nSo, pH =7.208 - 0.114=7.094.\n\n[H+]=1e-7.094 \u2248 8.08e-8.\n\nThen, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.08e-8.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should calculate this more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 1.8e-12 * 0.028065.\n\n1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517.\n\nSo 0.050517e-12 =5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.08e-8:\n\n5.0517e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.0517 /8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 /8.08 = let's compute:\n\n8.08 * 0.625 = 5.05.\n\nSo 5.05 /8.08 =0.625.\n\nSo 5.0517e-14 /8.08e-8 = 0.625e-6 =6.25e-7 M.\n\nWhich is about 6.25e-7, matching option A (6.24e-7).\n\nSo I think the correct answer is option A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The solution contains H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, which are the relevant species for the buffer. The concentration of PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b is derived from the dissociation of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, governed by the third dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka\u2083 = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate moles of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b\n- Moles of KH\u2082PO\u2084 = \\( \\frac{1.00 \\, \\text{g}}{136.09 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.007334 \\, \\text{mol} \\), contributing 0.007334 mol of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b.\n- Moles of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O = \\( \\frac{1.00 \\, \\text{g}}{177.99 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.005613 \\, \\text{mol} \\), contributing 0.005613 mol of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b\nThe solution volume is 200.00 cm\u00b3 = 0.2 L.  \n- Concentration of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b = \\( \\frac{0.007334 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.2 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.03667 \\, \\text{M} \\).  \n- Concentration of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b = \\( \\frac{0.005613 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.2 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.028065 \\, \\text{M} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH\nThe relevant equilibrium is between H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, governed by Ka\u2082 = 6.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2078. The pKa\u2082 is:  \n\\[\n\\text{pKa}_2 = -\\log(6.2 \\times 10^{-8}) \\approx 7.208\n\\]\nUsing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  \n\\[\n\\text{pH} = \\text{pKa}_2 + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b}]}{[\\text{H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b}]}\\right)\n\\]\nSubstitute the concentrations:  \n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 7.208 + \\log\\left(\\frac{0.028065}{0.03667}\\right)\n\\]\nThe ratio \\( \\frac{0.028065}{0.03667} \\approx 0.766 \\), and \\( \\log(0.766) \\approx -0.114 \\). Thus:  \n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 7.208 - 0.114 = 7.094\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b] using Ka\u2083\nThe dissociation of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b to PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b is governed by:  \n\\[\n\\text{Ka}_3 = \\frac{[\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}][\\text{H}^+]}{[\\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b}]}\n\\]\nRearranging for [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b]:  \n\\[\n[\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}] = \\frac{\\text{Ka}_3 \\cdot [\\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b}]}{[\\text{H}^+]}\n\\]\nFrom the pH, \\( [\\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \\approx 8.08 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{M} \\).  \nSubstitute the values:  \n\\[\n[\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}] = \\frac{(1.8 \\times 10^{-12}) \\cdot (0.028065)}{8.08 \\times 10^{-8}}\n\\]\nCalculate the numerator:  \n\\[\n(1.8 \\times 10^{-12}) \\cdot (0.028065) \\approx 5.0517 \\times 10^{-14}\n\\]\nDivide by the denominator:  \n\\[\n[\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}] = \\frac{5.0517 \\times 10^{-14}}{8.08 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 6.25 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) is approximately \\( 6.24 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M} \\), which corresponds to **Option A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what the question says. \n\nThe solution volume is 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, which probably isn't too relevant except for any possible activity coefficients, but I think we can ignore that here.\n\nThe question is about orthophosphate ions. Wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? So I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution.\n\nThe Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps.\n\nBut wait, what's the relation between the salts given and the phosphate ions? Let's think. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K H2PO4, so when it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When dissolved, it would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, plus the water of course, but that probably doesn't affect the ions in solution.\n\nSo, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But orthophosphate is PO4^3- which is the deprotonated form. Hmm, so how do these ions relate?\n\nI remember that in solution, these phosphate species can interconvert based on the pH. The presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that the solution is buffered around the second dissociation constant (Ka2), because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but in this solution, since both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O are present, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the pH would be around the pKa2 of H3PO4. Let's calculate that. pKa2 is the negative log of Ka2. Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.21.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions. But in solution, at pH around 7.2, which is just below neutral, the predominant species would be HPO4^2- and some H2PO4^- and maybe a little PO4^3-. Hmm, but how much PO4^3- is there?\n\nWait, PO4^3- is the third deprotonated form. The third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low unless the solution is strongly basic.\n\nBut in this case, the solution is buffered around pKa2, which is around 7.2. So the pH is a bit higher than neutral, but not extremely high. So the HPO4^2- is the main species, but some might deprotonate to PO4^3-. But how much?\n\nWait, but maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the solution is a buffer solution, so the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and then use that pH to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the concentrations of each phosphate species in the solution and then find the PO4^3- concentration based on the pH.\n\nLet me think. First, find the moles of each salt.\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g. Mw is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007344 mol.\n\nSimilarly, moles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005607 mol.\n\nWait, but what's the stoichiometry here? KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-. So the moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 is 0.007344 mol.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So the moles of HPO4^2- from this is 0.005607 mol.\n\nSo in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nNow, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([A^-]/[HA])\n\nWhere HA is H2PO4^- and A^- is HPO4^2-.\n\nSo [A^-] is 0.005607 mol, and [HA] is 0.007344 mol.\n\nWait, but the total volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations are moles divided by 0.2.\n\nSo [A^-] = 0.005607 / 0.2 = 0.028035 M.\n\n[HA] = 0.007344 / 0.2 = 0.03672 M.\n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log(0.028035 / 0.03672)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.028035 / 0.03672 \u2248 0.763.\n\nLog(0.763) is approximately log(0.76) \u2248 -0.117.\n\nSo pH = 7.21 + (-0.117) \u2248 7.093.\n\nSo pH is about 7.09.\n\nNow, to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nPO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-:\n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nSo, using the expression for Ka3:\n\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can solve for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nBut [H+] can be found from pH. pH is 7.09, so [H+] = 10^-7.09 \u2248 8.23e-8 M.\n\nWait, let me calculate that more accurately.\n\npH =7.09 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-7.09) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.09) \u2248 1e-7 * 0.81 \u2248 8.1e-8.\n\nSo, [H+] \u2248 8.1e-8 M.\n\nNow, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028035 M, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.1e-8)\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 \u2248 5.0463e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.1e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] \u2248 (5.0463e-14) / (8.1e-8) \u2248 6.23e-7 M.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Because the HPO4^2- concentration is 0.028035 M, but in solution, some of it might deprotonate to PO4^3- based on the pH. Alternatively, the solution's pH is below the pKa3, which is about 12 (since pKa3 is log(1.8e-12) \u2248 11.74). So pH 7.09 is much lower than pKa3, which means that the majority of HPO4^2- remains as HPO4^2-; the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low.\n\nBut according to our calculation, it's about 6.23e-7 M. Let's see the options. Option A is 6.24e-7, which matches. But wait, let me double-check my steps.\n\nWait, another point: the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028035 M, but in reality, some of that will convert to PO4^3-.\n\nBut in the calculation, I used the initial concentration of HPO4^2- to compute the PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but the Henderson equation gives the pH based on the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual concentration of HPO4^2- is less because some of it has deprotonated to PO4^3-. But wait, given that the pH is much lower than pKa3 (7.09 vs 11.74), the extent of deprotonation is minimal, so the approximation holds.\n\nWait, but let's think about it. The reaction is HPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+. At pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3 (around 12), the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low. So our initial approach is correct.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] \u2248 6.23e-7 M, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again for any possible errors.\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: 1g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007344 mol. Volume is 0.2 L \u2192 0.03672 M H2PO4^-.\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1g /177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005607 mol. Volume 0.2 L \u2192 0.028035 M HPO4^2-.\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) \u2192 7.21 + log(0.028035 / 0.03672) \u2192 7.21 + log(0.763) \u2192 log(0.763) is about -0.117, so pH \u22487.093.\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what the question says. \n\nThe solution volume is 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, which probably isn't too relevant except for any possible activity coefficients, but I think we can ignore that here.\n\nThe question is about orthophosphate ions. Wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? So I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution.\n\nThe Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps.\n\nBut wait, what's the relation between the salts given and the phosphate ions? Let's think. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K H2PO4, so when it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When dissolved, it would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, plus the water of course, but that probably doesn't affect the ions in solution.\n\nSo, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But orthophosphate is PO4^3- which is the deprotonated form. Hmm, so how do these ions relate?\n\nI remember that in solution, these phosphate species can interconvert based on the pH. The presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that the solution is buffered around the second dissociation constant (Ka2), because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but in this solution, since both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O are present, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the pH would be around the pKa2 of H3PO4. Let's calculate that. pKa2 is the negative log of Ka2. Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.21.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions. But in solution, at pH around 7.2, which is just below neutral, the predominant species would be HPO4^2- and some H2PO4^- and maybe a little PO4^3-. Hmm, but how much PO4^3- is there?\n\nWait, PO4^3- is the third deprotonated form. The third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low unless the solution is strongly basic.\n\nBut in this case, the solution is buffered around pKa2, which is around 7.2. So the pH is a bit higher than neutral, but not extremely high. So the HPO4^2- is the main species, but some might deprotonate to PO4^3-. But how much?\n\nWait, but maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the solution is a buffer solution, so the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and then use that pH to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the concentrations of each phosphate species in the solution and then find the PO4^3- concentration based on the pH.\n\nLet me think. First, find the moles of each salt.\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g. Mw is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007344 mol.\n\nSimilarly, moles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005607 mol.\n\nWait, but what's the stoichiometry here? KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-. So the moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 is 0.007344 mol.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So the moles of HPO4^2- from this is 0.005607 mol.\n\nSo in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nNow, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([A^-]/[HA])\n\nWhere HA is H2PO4^- and A^- is HPO4^2-.\n\nSo [A^-] is 0.005607 mol, and [HA] is 0.007344 mol.\n\nWait, but the total volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations are moles divided by 0.2.\n\nSo [A^-] = 0.005607 / 0.2 = 0.028035 M.\n\n[HA] = 0.007344 / 0.2 = 0.03672 M.\n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log(0.028035 / 0.03672)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.028035 / 0.03672 \u2248 0.763.\n\nLog(0.763) is approximately log(0.76) \u2248 -0.117.\n\nSo pH = 7.21 + (-0.117) \u2248 7.093.\n\nSo pH is about 7.09.\n\nNow, to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nPO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-:\n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nSo, using the expression for Ka3:\n\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can solve for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nBut [H+] can be found from pH. pH is 7.09, so [H+] = 10^-7.09 \u2248 8.23e-8 M.\n\nWait, let me calculate that more accurately.\n\npH =7.09 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-7.09) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.09) \u2248 1e-7 * 0.81 \u2248 8.1e-8.\n\nSo, [H+] \u2248 8.1e-8 M.\n\nNow, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028035 M, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.1e-8)\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 \u2248 5.0463e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.1e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] \u2248 (5.0463e-14) / (8.1e-8) \u2248 6.23e-7 M.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Because the HPO4^2- concentration is 0.028035 M, but in solution, some of it might deprotonate to PO4^3- based on the pH. Alternatively, the solution's pH is below the pKa3, which is about 12 (since pKa3 is log(1.8e-12) \u2248 11.74). So pH 7.09 is much lower than pKa3, which means that the majority of HPO4^2- remains as HPO4^2-; the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low.\n\nBut according to our calculation, it's about 6.23e-7 M. Let's see the options. Option A is 6.24e-7, which matches. But wait, let me double-check my steps.\n\nWait, another point: the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028035 M, but in reality, some of that will convert to PO4^3-.\n\nBut in the calculation, I used the initial concentration of HPO4^2- to compute the PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but the Henderson equation gives the pH based on the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual concentration of HPO4^2- is less because some of it has deprotonated to PO4^3-. But wait, given that the pH is much lower than pKa3 (7.09 vs 11.74), the extent of deprotonation is minimal, so the approximation holds.\n\nWait, but let's think about it. The reaction is HPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+. At pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3 (around 12), the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low. So our initial approach is correct.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] \u2248 6.23e-7 M, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again for any possible errors.\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: 1g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007344 mol. Volume is 0.2 L \u2192 0.03672 M H2PO4^-.\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1g /177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005607 mol. Volume 0.2 L \u2192 0.028035 M HPO4^2-.\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) \u2192 7.21 + log(0.028035 / 0.03672) \u2192 7.21 + log(0.763) \u2192 log(0.763) is about -0.117, so pH \u22487.093.\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12. [HPO4^2-] is 0.028035 M. [H+] is 1e-7.09 \u2192 8.1e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / 8.1e-8 = (5.046e-14) / 8.1e-8 \u2248 6.23e-7 M.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct. The answer should be option A: 6.24e-7 M.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which matches.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is HPO4^3- or PO4^3- maybe? Wait, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, right? So its dissociation steps are important here.\n\nThe problem says we have a solution with 200 cm\u00b3 (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate.\n\nSo first, I need to find the number of moles of each compound. Let's calculate that.\n\nFor KH2PO4:\nMolar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.00734 mol.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O:\nMass is 1.00 g.

So the species in solution are H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4).\n\nWait, but in solution, these can interconvert based on the pH. So the presence of both might lead to some equilibrium between them.\n\nWait, but since we have both KH2PO4 (which gives H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which gives HPO4^2-), the solution is probably a buffer solution because it contains a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-).\n\nSo the pH of the solution will be determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me recall: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).\n\nWait, which Ka are we looking at? H3PO4 has three dissociation steps. The first is H3PO4 \u2194 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- \u2194 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12).\n\nSo for the buffer, the relevant Ka is the second one, Ka2, because we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base), with pKa2.\n\nSo pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 let's calculate that. Log(6.2) is about 0.792, so 6.2e-8 \u2192 log(6.2e-8) = 0.792 -8 = -7.208. So pKa2 \u2248 7.208.\n\nNow, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the solution. The ratio of base to acid is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].\n\nThe moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4 is 0.005603 mol. The moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 is 0.00734 mol. So the ratio is 0.005603 / 0.00734 \u2248 0.763.\n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log(0.763). Let's compute log(0.763). Since 0.763 is less than 1, the log will be negative. Log(0.763) \u2248 -0.117.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.208 - 0.117 \u2248 7.091.\n\nNow, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3- (orthophosphate ions). Because we're looking for PO4^3-, which is the third deprotonation step.\n\nThe third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12.\n\nAt pH 7.091, let's find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nThe expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nBut [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.091) \u2248 8.33e-8 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (concentration of HPO4^2-) / (8.33e-8).\n\nWait, but the concentration of HPO4^2- isn't just the moles divided by volume, because some of it might have dissociated into PO4^3-.\n\nWait, no. Because in the buffer solution, the majority of HPO4^2- remains as HPO4^2-, and only a small amount converts to PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this using the third dissociation.\n\nLet me think about the species present. The solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- as the main species. But some HPO4^2- can dissociate further into PO4^3- and H+.\n\nThe concentration of HPO4^2- is from the Na2HPO4, but some of it dissociates. Wait, but in the buffer solution, the pH is around 7.09, which is higher than pKa3 (since pKa3 is about 11.75, because Ka3 is 1.8e-12 \u2192 pKa3 \u2248 11.74). Wait, wait: wait, pKa3 is -log(1.8e-12) \u2248 11.74. So pH 7.09 is below pKa3, meaning that the solution is acidic relative to pKa3. So the equilibrium for the third dissociation will favor the HPO4^2- form, and PO4^3- will be very low.\n\nSo the concentration of PO4^3- will be determined by the third dissociation.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute the concentration using the third Ka.\n\nSo, the total HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, which is 0.005603 mol in 0.2 L, so initial concentration is 0.028015 M (0.005603 / 0.2). But some of this HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3- and H+.\n\nWait, but in solution, the HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-:\n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so the extent of dissociation is minimal.\n\nAt pH 7.09, [H+] is about 8.33e-8 M.\n\nSo, using the expression:\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nRearranged to [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nThe initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.028015 M. But in reality, some of this will dissociate, but given that Ka3 is so small, the change will be negligible. So we can approximate [HPO4^2-] \u2248 0.028015 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028015) / (8.33e-8)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.028015 = 5.0427e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.33e-8: 5.0427e-14 / 8.33e-8 \u2248 6.05e-7 M.\n\nWait, but wait: the volume is 0.2 L, so the moles would be 0.005603 mol for HPO4^2-.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should account for the fact that the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is as calculated earlier.\n\nWait, another approach: the concentration of HPO4^2- is (0.005603 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.028015 M.\n\nSimilarly, the H2PO4^- is 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.\n\nBut when considering the third dissociation, the HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3-.\n\nThe expression is [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nSo plugging the numbers:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028015 M.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.091) \u2248 8.33e-8 M.\n\nSo:\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.028015) / (8.33e-8) \u2248 (5.0427e-14) / (8.33e-8) \u2248 6.05e-7 M.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7, etc. Hmm, so 6.05e-7 is close to option A. But wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, let me recalculate the [H+].\n\npH = 7.091 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-7.091) = 10^(-7 -0.091) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.091). 10^(-0.091) is about 0.833, so [H+] is approx 8.33e-8 M. That's correct.\n\nNow, 1.8e-12 * 0.028015 = let's compute that accurately.\n\n1.8 * 0.028015 = 0.050427. Then, 0.050427e-12 \u2192 5.0427e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.33e-8: 5.0427e-14 / 8.33e-8 = (5.0427 / 8.33) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0427 / 8.33 \u2248 0.605.\n\nSo 0.605e-6 \u2192 6.05e-7 M.\n\nHmm, but none of the options exactly match that. The options are A) 6.24e-7, B) 5.48e-7, C) 2.81e-7, D) 3.97e-7.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the total concentration of phosphate species includes H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But in this case, since the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the pH is around 7.09, which is below pKa3 (11.74), the concentration of PO4^3- would be minimal, but perhaps there's another approach.\n\nWait, another approach: the total phosphate concentration is the sum of all phosphate species. But the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the solution as a buffer and calculate the pH, then find [PO4^3-] based on the third dissociation.\n\nWait, but I did that. So according to my calculation, it's approximately 6.05e-7 M. The closest option is A) 6.24e-7. But perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.\n\nLet me recalculate [H+].\n\npH =7.091 \u2192 [H+] = 10^-7.091.\n\nLet me compute 10^(-7.091) accurately.\n\n7.091 is 7 + 0.091.\n\n10^(-0.091) is 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794, but 0.091 is a bit less than 0.1.\n\nUsing a calculator approach: ln(10^0.091) = 0.091 * ln(10) \u2248 0.091 * 2.3026 \u2248 0.2096. So 10^0.091 \u2248 e^0.2096 \u2248 1.232.\n\nWait, wait no: 10^x is e^(x ln10). So 10^0.091 = e^(0.091 * 2.3026) \u2248 e^0.2096 \u2248 1.232. So 10^(-0.091) = 1/1.232 \u2248 0.8116.\n\nSo [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.8116 \u2248 8.116e-8 M.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028015) / (8.116e-8) = (5.0427e-14) / (8.116e-8) \u2248 6.21e-7 M.\n\nAh, that's closer to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nWait, perhaps I should do the calculation more precisely.\n\nCompute 1.8e-12 * 0.028015:\n\n1.8 * 0.028015 = 0.050427 \u2192 5.0427e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.116e-8: 5.0427e-14 / 8.116e-8 = (5.0427 / 8.116) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0427 / 8.116 \u2248 0.621.\n\nSo 0.621e-6 \u2192 6.21e-7 M.\n\nWhich is about 6.21e-7 M. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So the correct answer would be A.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is PO4^3- the correct species? Or is orthophosphate HPO4^2-?\n\nWait, orthophosphate can refer to PO4^3-, but sometimes HPO4^2- is also called orthophosphate. So maybe I got the wrong species. Wait, the problem says 'orthophosphate ions'\u2014I think orthophosphate is PO4^3-.\n\nBut in that case, the calculation is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering HPO4^2- as orthophosphate, which would make the concentration higher.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions, which I believe are the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.\n\nSo, given that, the answer would be approximately 6.21e-7 M, which aligns with option A (6.24e-7).\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps the total concentration of phosphate ions is the sum of all species, but the question is only about PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by both the Na2HPO4 and the KH2PO4.\n\nWait, but no. The KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^-, which is the acid form, and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-, which is the conjugate base.\n\nIn any case, the calculation seems to point towards option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the buffer solution. Let me recheck.\n\nThe buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- with a pH of ~7.09. Then, the PO4^3- comes from the further deprotonation of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, using Ka3, which is 1.8e-12, and [H+] is 8.116e-8, as computed.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.028015 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028015) / 8.116e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8 * 0.028015 = 0.050427 \u2192 5.0427e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.116e-8 \u2192 5.0427e-14 / 8.116e-8 \u2248 6.21e-7 M.\n\nYes, so that's approximately 6.21e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nSo the answer should be A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is HPO4^3- or PO4^3- maybe? Wait, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, right? So its dissociation steps are important here.\n\nThe problem says we have a solution with 200 cm\u00b3 (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate.\n\nSo first, I need to find the number of moles of each compound. Let's calculate that.\n\nFor KH2PO4:\nMolar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.00734 mol.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O:\nMass is 1.00 g. Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005603 mol.\n\nWait, but Na2HPO4 is the same as disodium hydrogen phosphate. So each mole of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O would give one mole of HPO4^2- when dissolved, right? Because the formula is Na2HPO4, which dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.\n\nNow, when these two salts are dissolved in water, they'll contribute to the phosphate species. Let's think about their dissociation.\n\nKH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.\n\nSo in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nBut the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? Or wait, no. Wait, I think orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but that's when it's fully deprotonated. So the species in solution are H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4).\n\nWait, but in solution, these can interconvert based on the pH. So the presence of both might lead to some equilibrium between them.\n\nWait, but since we have both KH2PO4 (which gives H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which gives HPO4^2-), the solution is probably a buffer solution because it contains a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-).\n\nSo the pH of the solution will be determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me recall: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).\n\nWait, which Ka are we looking at? H3PO4 has three dissociation steps. The first is H3PO4 \u2194 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- \u2194 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12).\n\nSo for the buffer, the relevant Ka is the second one, Ka2, because we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base), with pKa2.\n\nSo pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 let's calculate that. Log(6.2) is about 0.792, so 6.2e-8 \u2192 log(6.2e-8) = 0.792 -8 = -7.208. So pKa2 \u2248 7.208.\n\nNow, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the solution. The ratio of base to acid is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].\n\nThe moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4 is 0.005603 mol. The moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 is 0.00734 mol. So the ratio is 0.005603 / 0.00734 \u2248 0.763.\n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log(0.763). Let's compute log(0.763). Since 0.763 is less than 1, the log will be negative. Log(0.763) \u2248 -0.117.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.208 - 0.117 \u2248 7.091.\n\nNow, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3- (orthophosphate ions). Because we're looking for PO4^3-, which is the third deprotonation step.\n\nThe third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12.\n\nAt pH 7.091, let's find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nThe expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nBut [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.091) \u2248 8.33e-8 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (concentration of HPO4^2-) / (8.33e-8).\n\nWait, but the concentration of HPO4^2- isn't just the moles divided by volume, because some of it might have dissociated into PO4^3-.\n\nWait, no. Because in the buffer solution, the majority of HPO4^2- remains as HPO4^2-, and only a small amount converts to PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this using the third dissociation.\n\nLet me think about the species present. The solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- as the main species. But some HPO4^2- can dissociate further into PO4^3- and H+.\n\nThe concentration of HPO4^2- is from the Na2HPO4, but some of it dissociates. Wait, but in the buffer solution, the pH is around 7.09, which is higher than pKa3 (since pKa3 is about 11.75, because Ka3 is 1.8e-12 \u2192 pKa3 \u2248 11.74). Wait, wait: wait, pKa3 is -log(1.8e-12) \u2248 11.74. So pH 7.09 is below pKa3, meaning that the solution is acidic relative to pKa3. So the equilibrium for the third dissociation will favor the HPO4^2- form, and PO4^3- will be very low.\n\nSo the concentration of PO4^3- will be determined by the third dissociation.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute the concentration using the third Ka.\n\nSo, the total HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, which is 0.005603 mol in 0.2 L, so initial concentration is 0.028015 M (0.005603 / 0.2). But some of this HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3- and H+.\n\nWait, but in solution, the HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-:\n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so the extent of dissociation is minimal.\n\nAt pH 7.09, [H+] is about 8.33e-8 M.\n\nSo, using the expression:\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nRearranged to [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nThe initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.028015 M. But in reality, some of this will dissociate, but given that Ka3 is so small, the change will be negligible. So we can approximate [HPO4^2-] \u2248 0.028015 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028015) / (8.33e-8)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.028015 = 5.0427e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.33e-8: 5.0427e-14 / 8.33e-8 \u2248 6.05e-7 M.\n\nWait, but wait: the volume is 0.2 L, so the moles would be 0.005603 mol for HPO4^2-.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should account for the fact that the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is as calculated earlier.\n\nWait, another approach: the concentration of HPO4^2- is (0.005603 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.028015 M.\n\nSimilarly, the H2PO4^- is 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.\n\nBut when considering the third dissociation, the HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3-.\n\nThe expression is [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nSo plugging the numbers:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028015 M.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.091) \u2248 8.33e-8 M.\n\nSo:\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.028015) / (8.33e-8) \u2248 (5.0427e-14) / (8.33e-8) \u2248 6.05e-7 M.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7, etc. Hmm, so 6.05e-7 is close to option A. But wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, let me recalculate the [H+].\n\npH = 7.091 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-7.091) = 10^(-7 -0.091) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.091). 10^(-0.091) is about 0.833, so [H+] is approx 8.33e-8 M. That's correct.\n\nNow, 1.8e-12 * 0.028015 = let's compute that accurately.\n\n1.8 * 0.028015 = 0.050427. Then, 0.050427e-12 \u2192 5.0427e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.33e-8: 5.0427e-14 / 8.33e-8 = (5.0427 / 8.33) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0427 / 8.33 \u2248 0.605.\n\nSo 0.605e-6 \u2192 6.05e-7 M.\n\nHmm, but none of the options exactly match that. The options are A) 6.24e-7, B) 5.48e-7, C) 2.81e-7, D) 3.97e-7.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the total concentration of phosphate species includes H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But in this case, since the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the pH is around 7.09, which is below pKa3 (11.74), the concentration of PO4^3- would be minimal, but perhaps there's another approach.\n\nWait, another approach: the total phosphate concentration is the sum of all phosphate species. But the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the solution as a buffer and calculate the pH, then find [PO4^3-] based on the third dissociation.\n\nWait, but I did that. So according to my calculation, it's approximately 6.05e-7 M. The closest option is A) 6.24e-7. But perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.\n\nLet me recalculate [H+].\n\npH =7.091 \u2192 [H+] = 10^-7.091.\n\nLet me compute 10^(-7.091) accurately.\n\n7.091 is 7 + 0.091.\n\n10^(-0.091) is 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794, but 0.091 is a bit less than 0.1.\n\nUsing a calculator approach: ln(10^0.091) = 0.091 * ln(10) \u2248 0.091 * 2.3026 \u2248 0.2096. So 10^0.091 \u2248 e^0.2096 \u2248 1.232.\n\nWait, wait no: 10^x is e^(x ln10). So 10^0.091 = e^(0.091 * 2.3026) \u2248 e^0.2096 \u2248 1.232. So 10^(-0.091) = 1/1.232 \u2248 0.8116.\n\nSo [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.8116 \u2248 8.116e-8 M.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028015) / (8.116e-8) = (5.0427e-14) / (8.116e-8) \u2248 6.21e-7 M.\n\nAh, that's closer to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nWait, perhaps I should do the calculation more precisely.\n\nCompute 1.8e-12 * 0.028015:\n\n1.8 * 0.028015 = 0.050427 \u2192 5.0427e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.116e-8: 5.0427e-14 / 8.116e-8 = (5.0427 / 8.116) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0427 / 8.116 \u2248 0.621.\n\nSo 0.621e-6 \u2192 6.21e-7 M.\n\nWhich is about 6.21e-7 M. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So the correct answer would be A.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is PO4^3- the correct species? Or is orthophosphate HPO4^2-?\n\nWait, orthophosphate can refer to PO4^3-, but sometimes HPO4^2- is also called orthophosphate. So maybe I got the wrong species. Wait, the problem says 'orthophosphate ions'\u2014I think orthophosphate is PO4^3-.\n\nBut in that case, the calculation is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering HPO4^2- as orthophosphate, which would make the concentration higher.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions, which I believe are the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.\n\nSo, given that, the answer would be approximately 6.21e-7 M, which aligns with option A (6.24e-7).\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps the total concentration of phosphate ions is the sum of all species, but the question is only about PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by both the Na2HPO4 and the KH2PO4.\n\nWait, but no. The KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^-, which is the acid form, and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-, which is the conjugate base.\n\nIn any case, the calculation seems to point towards option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the buffer solution. Let me recheck.\n\nThe buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- with a pH of ~7.09. Then, the PO4^3- comes from the further deprotonation of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, using Ka3, which is 1.8e-12, and [H+] is 8.116e-8, as computed.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.028015 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028015) / 8.116e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8 * 0.028015 = 0.050427 \u2192 5.0427e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.116e-8 \u2192 5.0427e-14 / 8.116e-8 \u2248 6.21e-7 M.\n\nYes, so that's approximately 6.21e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nSo the answer should be A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use the third dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, \\( K_a3 \\), since orthophosphate corresponds to the fully deprotonated form, \\( \\text{PO}_4^{3-} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt\n- **KH\u2082PO\u2084**:  \n  \\( \\text{Molar mass} = 136.09 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\)  \n  \\( \\text{Moles} = \\frac{1.00 \\, \\text{g}}{136.09 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.00734 \\, \\text{mol} \\).  \n  Dissociates to give \\( \\text{H}_2\\text{PO}_4^- \\).\n\n- **Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O**:  \n  \\( \\text{Molar mass} = 177.99 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\)  \n  \\( \\text{Moles} = \\frac{1.00 \\, \\text{g}}{177.99 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.005603 \\, \\text{mol} \\).  \n  Dissociates to give \\( \\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the pH of the buffer solution\nThe solution is a buffer containing \\( \\text{H}_2\\text{PO}_4^- \\) (acid) and \\( \\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \\) (base).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nI remember that orthophosphate ions are HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, no, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but in solution, it can take various forms depending on the pH. Hmm, but wait, wait. The problem mentions orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO4^3-.\n\nBut wait, let me think. H3PO4 is triprotic, so it can donate three protons. So, the species in solution can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.\n\nThe solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. So, let's break down what each of these salts dissociates into.\n\nKH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. So each Na2HPO4 gives two Na+ and one HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But wait, phosphate can undergo hydrolysis, so these ions can interconvert.\n\nThe problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-? Or wait, no, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but in this solution, are we going to have PO4^3-? Because the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are in the middle of the deprotonation steps. So, to get PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated species, we might need to consider the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2- itself? Wait, no, I think orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- species. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. The first deprotonation gives H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), the second gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and the third gives PO4^3- (orthophosphate). Oh, right, so orthophosphate is PO4^3-.\n\nSo, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. But since PO4^3- is the fully deprotonated form, perhaps very little of it is present unless the solution is highly basic. But let's think about the pH.\n\nWait, but the problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. So, I need to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- in solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. No, I think that's incorrect. PO4^3- is the orthophosphate ion.\n\nSo, the plan is: determine the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, then find out how much of each converts to PO4^3- through hydrolysis, considering the Ka3 value.\n\nWait, but first, perhaps I should compute the concentrations of each salt in the solution.\n\nSo, the solution has 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Let's compute the moles of each.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So, 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007338 mol. So, approximately 0.007338 moles of KH2PO4. Each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-, so [H2PO4^-] is 0.007338 / 0.2 L = 0.03669 M.\n\nSimilarly, for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So, 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005617 mol. Each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2- (since each Na2HPO4 gives 2 Na+ and 1 HPO4^2-). So, [HPO4^2-] is 0.005617 / 0.2 L = 0.028085 M.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: when dissolved, each formula unit releases two Na+ and one HPO4^2- and two water molecules. So, yes, each mole of the salt gives one mole of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, now we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. Now, these can react with water to form PO4^3-.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-. So, I need to find [PO4^3-].\n\nTo find this, perhaps I should consider the hydrolysis reactions of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate another proton to become PO4^3-.\n\nBut the relevant equilibrium here is the hydrolysis of HPO4^2- to form PO4^3- and H2O.\n\nThe relevant Ka for this step is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12.\n\nThe reaction is: HPO4^2- + H2O \u2194 PO4^3- + H3O+.\n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, meaning that the extent of hydrolysis is very low.\n\nSo, the [PO4^3-] will be very low, and we can perhaps approximate it by considering the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, the solution also contains H2PO4^-, which can act as a base. Or, more accurately, H2PO4^- can deprotonate to form HPO4^2-, but in this case, we're looking at the deprotonation of HPO4^2- to form PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the overall phosphate equilibrium.\n\nWait, another approach: the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWe can model the system by considering all possible equilibria.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total phosphate concentration and then find the distribution of species based on pH.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to first compute the pH of the solution, because the phosphate species depend on pH.\n\nWait, the solution is a buffer solution because it contains a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, but wait: H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (from the first dissociation), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so that's a buffer system involving the second dissociation (since H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base for the second step).\n\nWait, no: H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). Similarly, HPO4^2- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become PO4^3-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-).\n\nBut in this solution, since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH will be determined by the pKa2 of H3PO4, because we have a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nThe buffer equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nWait, yes, because in the second dissociation, H2PO4^- \u2194 HPO4^2- + H+.\n\nSo, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies here. So, let's compute the pH first.\n\nCompute pKa2: Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) \u2248 7.21 (because log(6.2)=0.79, so 6.2e-8 is 1e-7.21, so pKa2 is approximately 7.21).\n\nWait, wait, no. The pKa is the negative log of Ka. So, pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).\n\nLet me compute that: 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8. Log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So, pKa2 is 7.2076, approximately 7.21.\n\nSo, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nWe have [HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M and [H2PO4^-] = 0.03669 M.\n\nSo, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028085 / 0.03669 \u2248 0.766.\n\nSo, log(0.766) \u2248 -0.113.\n\nSo, pH = 7.21 + (-0.113) \u2248 7.097.\n\nSo, the pH of the solution is approximately 7.10.\n\nNow, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nBecause PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-:\n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+.\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nSo, the expression is Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWe have Ka3 =1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M, and [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.10) \u2248 7.94e-8 M.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (7.94e-8)\n\nLet me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = approx 5.055e-14.\n\nDenominator: 7.94e-8.\n\nSo, 5.055e-14 / 7.94e-8 = approximately (5.055 / 7.94) * 1e-6.\n\n5.055 / 7.94 is about 0.637.\n\nSo, 0.637e-6 = 6.37e-7 M.\n\nWait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me redo the math.\n\nCalculating [PO4^3-]:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.10) = 7.94e-8 M.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / 7.94e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = ?\n\n1.8 * 0.028085 = 0.050553. So, 0.050553e-12 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator: 7.94e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0553e-14 /7.94e-8 = (5.0553 /7.94) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553 /7.94 \u2248 0.637.\n\nSo, 0.637e-6 = 6.37e-7 M.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the closest option is A)6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, D)3.97e-7. So, 6.37e-7 is close to option A (6.24e-7), but let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.\n\nLet me compute [H+] more accurately.\n\npH is 7.097, so [H+] = 10^(-7.097) \u2248 ?\n\n10^(-7) is 1e-7.\n\n0.097 is approximately 0.097, so 10^(-0.097) \u2248 0.87 (since log(8.7) is about 0.94, so 10^(-0.097)= ~0.87).\n\nWait, 10^(-0.097)= 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794, but for 0.097, let's compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula: 10^x \u2248 1 + x * ln(10), but maybe better to just use a calculator-like approach.\n\nWait, I can think of 10^0.097 as e^(0.097 * ln10) \u2248 e^(0.097 * 2.3026) \u2248 e^(0.2237) \u2248 1.250.\n\nWait, wait no, 10^0.097 is the same as e^(0.097 * ln10) \u2248 e^(0.097 * 2.302585) \u2248 e^(0.2237) \u2248 1.250. So, 10^(-0.097) is 1/1.250 \u2248 0.8.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with more accurate figures.\n\nBut maybe I should check if I made a mistake earlier in the approach.\n\nWait, another approach: since PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2- and H2O, perhaps the concentration can be calculated using the Ka3 and the [HPO4^2-].\n\nBut another thought: perhaps the solution isn't only affected by the HPO4^2- hydrolysis but also by the H2PO4^- hydrolysis. Wait, H2PO4^- can hydrolyze to HPO4^2- and H+ as well. But since H2PO4^- has a higher concentration, but its Ka2 is 6.2e-8, which is larger than Ka3.\n\nWait, but perhaps the contribution from H2PO4^- to PO4^3- is negligible compared to HPO4^2-.\n\nBecause H2PO4^- \u2192 HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2=6.2e-8), and HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3=1.8e-12).\n\nSo, the HPO4^2- hydrolysis is much less likely than H2PO4^- hydrolysis. So, the main source of PO4^3- is the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but another possibility: perhaps the solution's pH is determined by both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which form a buffer. So, the pH is around pKa2, which we calculated as 7.10.\n\nSo, perhaps the [PO4^3-] is very low, as we calculated around 6.37e-7 M. But looking at the options, the closest is option A (6.24e-7), but let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, let me do the exact calculation.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.097) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.097) = 1e-7 * (10^(-0.097)).\n\nCompute 10^(-0.097): take natural log.\n\nln(10^(-0.097)) = -0.097 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.097 * 2.302585 \u2248 -0.22375.\n\nSo, e^(-0.22375) \u2248 0.800. So, 10^(-0.097) \u2248 0.8, so [H+] = 8e-8 M.\n\nWait, wait, no: 10^(-7.097) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.097) = 1e-7 * 0.8 \u2248 8e-8 M.\n\nWait, that's 8e-8 M.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8e-8).\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0553e-14 /8e-8 = (5.0553/8) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553 /8 \u2248 0.6319125.\n\nSo, 0.6319125e-6 = 6.319e-7 M.\n\nHmm, so around 6.32e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7). But wait, perhaps the more accurate calculation will bring it closer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the pH more precisely.\n\nWe had [HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M, [H2PO4^-] = 0.03669 M.\n\nThe ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.028085 / 0.03669 = let me compute that exactly.\n\n0.028085 \u00f7 0.03669 \u2248 0.7663.\n\nSo, log(0.7663) = ?\n\nWe can use the approximation: log(0.7663) = log(7.663e-1) = log(7.663) + log(1e-1) = 0.885 + (-1) = -0.115.\n\nSo, pH = pKa2 + (-0.115) = 7.21 - 0.115 = 7.095.\n\nSo, [H+] = 10^(-7.095) \u2248 8.0e-8 M.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute 10^(-7.095) more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 7.095 as 7 + 0.095.\n\n10^(-7.095) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.095).\n\nCompute 10^(-0.095):\n\nTake natural log: ln(10^(-0.095)) = -0.095 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.095 * 2.302585 \u2248 -0.218745.\n\ne^(-0.218745) \u2248 0.803.\n\nSo, 10^(-0.095) \u2248 0.803.\n\nSo, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.803 = 8.03e-8 M.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.03e-8).\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.03e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0553e-14 /8.03e-8 = (5.0553 /8.03) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553 \u00f78.03 \u2248 0.6296.\n\nSo, 0.6296e-6 = 6.296e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.30e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 6.24e-7\n\nB)5.48e-7 \n\nC)2.81e-7 \n\nD)3.97e-7 \n\nSo, 6.30e-7 is closest to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution's volume is 0.2 L, and the moles of PO4^3- would be negligible, so perhaps I should compute the total phosphate species.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the concentrations. Wait, another approach: perhaps the total phosphate concentration comes from both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and any PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but no, the question only asks for [PO4^3-].\n\nWait, but perhaps another consideration: the solution might also have some contribution from H2PO4^- hydrolyzing to form PO4^3-.\n\nBut wait, H2PO4^- hydrolyzes in two steps:\n\nH2PO4^- \u2192 HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2=6.2e-8)\n\nHPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3=1.8e-12)\n\nSo, the contribution from H2PO4^- to PO4^3- is through two steps. But since each step is much more likely, the amount of PO4^3- from H2PO4^- is negligible compared to that from HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, perhaps I can ignore the H2PO4^- contribution.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's compute the [PO4^3-] from H2PO4^-.\n\nH2PO4^- can donate two protons to become PO4^3-.\n\nThe overall reaction is H2PO4^- \u2192 PO4^3- + 2 H+.\n\nThe overall Ka would be Ka2 * Ka3 = 6.2e-8 * 1.8e-12 = 1.116e-19.\n\nSo, the expression for this is:\n\nKa_total = [PO4^3-][H+]^2 / [H2PO4^-]\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (Ka_total * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]^2\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nKa_total = 1.116e-19\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.03669 M\n\n[H+] = 8.03e-8 M.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.116e-19 * 0.03669) / (8.03e-8)^2\n\nCompute numerator: 1.116e-19 * 0.03669 \u2248 4.096e-21.\n\nDenominator: (8.03e-8)^2 \u2248 6.45e-15.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = 4.096e-21 /6.45e-15 \u2248 6.36e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's about 6.36e-7 M, which is similar to what I found earlier. But wait, that can't be right because the two contributions would add up, but this seems to suggest that the H2PO4^- contributes about the same as HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, that can't be correct. Because the HPO4^2- is 0.028 M, and H2PO4^- is 0.0367 M, but the overall Ka for H2PO4^- \u2192 PO4^3- is much smaller than that for HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3-.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.\n\nWait, [PO4^3-] from H2PO4^- would be:\n\nKa_total = ( [PO4^3-] [H+]^2 ) / [H2PO4^-]\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka_total * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]^2.\n\nKa_total is 1.116e-19.\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.03669 M.\n\n[H+] is 8.03e-8, so [H+]^2 = (8.03e-8)^2 = 6.45e-15.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.116e-19 * 0.03669) / 6.45e-15.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.116e-19 * 0.03669 \u2248 4.096e-21.\n\n4.096e-21 /6.45e-15 = approx 6.36e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. But that would imply that the contribution from H2PO4^- is similar to that from HPO4^2-, which seems contradictory because the HPO4^2- has a higher concentration and a higher Ka (for its own hydrolysis) but a lower K for the overall reaction.\n\nWait, no, wait. HPO4^2- hydrolyzes with a Ka3 of 1.8e-12, while H2PO4^- hydrolyzes with a combined Ka of 1.116e-19. So, HPO4^2- is more likely to hydrolyze than H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, both contribute about the same. That doesn't make sense. There must be a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is that I'm considering the overall reaction for H2PO4^- \u2192 PO4^3- as a single step, but in reality, it's two sequential steps, each with their own K. So, the [PO4^3-] from H2PO4^- would be (Ka2 * Ka3 * [H2PO4^-]) / (Ka1 * [H+]^2) ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the contribution from H2PO4^- is negligible compared to HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, let's compute the [PO4^3-] from each source separately.\n\nFrom HPO4^2-:\n\n[PO4^3-]_1 = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\n= (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.03e-8)\n\n\u2248 (5.055e-14) /8.03e-8 \u2248 6.296e-7 M.\n\nFrom H2PO4^-:\n\n[PO4^3-]_2 = (Ka2 * Ka3 * [H2PO4^-]) / ([H+]^2 * (1 + ... )) ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as:\n\nH2PO4^- \u2192 HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2=6.2e-8)\n\nHPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3=1.8e-12)\n\nSo, the overall reaction is H2PO4^- \u2192 PO4^3- + 2 H+.\n\nThe combined Ka is Ka2 * Ka3 = 1.116e-19.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\nKa2*Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]^2 / [H2PO4^-].\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (Ka2*Ka3 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]^2.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nKa2*Ka3 =6.2e-8 *1.8e-12 = 1.116e-19.\n\n[H2PO4^-] =0.03669 M.\n\n[H+] =8.03e-8.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-]_2 = (1.116e-19 * 0.03669) / (8.03e-8)^2.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.116e-19 * 0.03669 \u2248 4.096e-21.\n\nDenominator: (8.03e-8)^2 \u22486.45e-15.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-]_2 = 4.096e-21 /6.45e-15 \u22486.36e-7 M.\n\nWait, but this can't be right because from HPO4^2-, we have [PO4^3-]_1 =6.3e-7, and from H2PO4^- another 6.3e-7. That would make the total [PO4^3-] about 1.26e-6, which is way higher than any option. So, this suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nAh, wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in assuming that the [PO4^3-] from H2PO4^- is independent of that from HPO4^2-. In reality, the [PO4^3-] is a single quantity, so the contributions from both sources should be considered together, not separately.\n\nBut given that the two contributions are similar, perhaps I should think of the system more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028 M and [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M is correct, but the presence of H2PO4^- will also produce some PO4^3- through its own hydrolysis, but perhaps it's negligible compared to the contribution from HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but according to the calculations, both contributions are about 6e-7, which seems contradictory. Because if both contribute equally, the total would be about 1.2e-6, but that's not any of the options. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider all phosphate species together.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = a\n\n[HPO4^2-] = b\n\n[PO4^3-] = c\n\nWe know that the solution contains a + b + c = total phosphate concentration.\n\nBut wait, the total phosphate comes from the two salts.\n\nThe total moles of phosphate from KH2PO4 is 0.007338 mol of H2PO4^-.\n\nThe total moles of phosphate from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 0.005617 mol of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, the total moles of phosphate in solution are 0.007338 + 0.005617 = 0.012955 mol.\n\nSo, total concentration is 0.012955 mol / 0.2 L = 0.064775 M.\n\nSo, a + b + c = 0.064775 M.\n\nBut a = [H2PO4^-] = 0.03669 M (from earlier), and b = 0.028085 M. So, a + b = 0.03669 + 0.028085 = 0.064775 M. So, c = 0.064775 - 0.064775 = 0. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, no, because in reality, some of the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will convert to PO4^3-.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the system with all the equilibria.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the [PO4^3-] is governed by the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-, and the contribution from H2PO4^- is negligible.\n\nSo, using [PO4^3-] \u2248 (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nWhich we calculated as approximately 6.3e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option A)6.24e-7.\n\nBut perhaps more precise calculation would bring it to 6.24e-7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact pH.\n\nLet me compute the pH more accurately.\n\npH = pKa2 + log(b/a)\n\nWhere b = [HPO4^2-] =0.028085, a = [H2PO4^-]=0.03669.\n\nSo, log(0.028085/0.03669)=log(0.7663) = -0.113.\n\nSo, pH=7.21 - 0.113=7.097.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.097) \u2248 8.0e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / 8.0e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.0e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0553e-14 /8.0e-8 =6.319e-7.\n\nHmm, so about 6.32e-7.\n\nBut option A is 6.24e-7, which is close.\n\nWait, perhaps the precise calculation would give a slightly lower value.\n\nWait, let me compute 10^(-7.097) more accurately.\n\n7.097 is 7 + 0.097.\n\nCompute 10^(-0.097):\n\nWe can use the Taylor series expansion for 10^x around x=0.\n\n10^x \u2248 1 + x ln(10) + (x^2 (ln(10))^2)/2 + ... \n\nx= -0.097.\n\nSo,\n\nln(10)=2.302585093.\n\nx ln(10)= -0.097 * 2.302585 \u2248 -0.22375.\n\nx^2 (ln(10))^2 = (0.097)^2 * (2.302585)^2 \u2248 0.009409 * 5.3019 \u2248 0.050.\n\nSo,\n\n10^(-0.097) \u2248 1 + (-0.22375) + (0.050)/2 = 1 - 0.22375 + 0.025 = 0.80125.\n\nSo, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.80125 = 8.0125e-8.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) /8.0125e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator:8.0125e-8.\n\n5.0553e-14 /8.0125e-8 = (5.0553 /8.0125) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553 \u00f78.0125 \u2248 0.6308.\n\nSo, 0.6308e-6 =6.308e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.31e-7 M.\n\nSo, this is very close to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nBut perhaps I should consider the exact value using more precise calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] concentrations.\n\nWait, the solution is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters.\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007338 mol.\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O:1.00g /177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005617 mol.\n\nSo, [H2PO4^-] =0.007338 /0.2 =0.03669 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] =0.005617 /0.2 =0.028085 M.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 6.24e-7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the [PO4^3-] calculation more accurately.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the initial concentrations are correct, and the [PO4^3-] is indeed approximately 6.3e-7, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is about half of 6.3e-7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the buffer calculation.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the solution isn't a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- but between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.\n\nBut that would be incorrect because the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by their ratio, which is the pKa2.\n\nWait, but perhaps the pH is around pKa2, so the [H+] is around 1e-7, which is what I used.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but that would require a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the orthophosphate is the sum of all species beyond HPO4^2-, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which species contribute to orthophosphate.\n\nWait, perhaps orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.\n\nNo, no.

So, the closest option is A (6.24e-7).\n\nBut perhaps the exact calculation would give 6.24e-7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the [H+] is 8.0e-8, leading to [PO4^3-] of (1.8e-12 *0.028085)/(8.0e-8) = (5.0553e-14)/(8e-8) = 6.32e-7.\n\nBut since the options don't have this exact value, perhaps the correct answer is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, 3.97e-7, but I can't see how that would come about.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hydrolysis step. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the reaction is HPO4^2- + H2O \u2194 PO4^3- + H3O+.\n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is [PO4^3-][H3O+]/[HPO4^2-].\n\nRearranged, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nKa3 =1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] =0.028085 M.\n\n[H+]=8.0e-8.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028085) /8.0e-8.\n\nWhich is (5.0553e-14)/8.0e-8 =6.319e-7.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nBut perhaps the exact value, when computed precisely, gives 6.24e-7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028085 M, but due to hydrolysis, the actual concentration is slightly less, which would increase [PO4^3-].\n\nBut given the problem's options, I think the intended answer is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nI remember that orthophosphate ions are HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, no, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but in solution, it can take various forms depending on the pH. Hmm, but wait, wait. The problem mentions orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO4^3-.\n\nBut wait, let me think. H3PO4 is triprotic, so it can donate three protons. So, the species in solution can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.\n\nThe solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. So, let's break down what each of these salts dissociates into.\n\nKH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. So each Na2HPO4 gives two Na+ and one HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But wait, phosphate can undergo hydrolysis, so these ions can interconvert.\n\nThe problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-? Or wait, no, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but in this solution, are we going to have PO4^3-? Because the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are in the middle of the deprotonation steps. So, to get PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated species, we might need to consider the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2- itself? Wait, no, I think orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- species. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. The first deprotonation gives H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), the second gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and the third gives PO4^3- (orthophosphate). Oh, right, so orthophosphate is PO4^3-.\n\nSo, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. But since PO4^3- is the fully deprotonated form, perhaps very little of it is present unless the solution is highly basic. But let's think about the pH.\n\nWait, but the problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. So, I need to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- in solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. No, I think that's incorrect. PO4^3- is the orthophosphate ion.\n\nSo, the plan is: determine the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, then find out how much of each converts to PO4^3- through hydrolysis, considering the Ka3 value.\n\nWait, but first, perhaps I should compute the concentrations of each salt in the solution.\n\nSo, the solution has 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Let's compute the moles of each.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So, 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007338 mol. So, approximately 0.007338 moles of KH2PO4. Each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-, so [H2PO4^-] is 0.007338 / 0.2 L = 0.03669 M.\n\nSimilarly, for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So, 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005617 mol. Each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2- (since each Na2HPO4 gives 2 Na+ and 1 HPO4^2-). So, [HPO4^2-] is 0.005617 / 0.2 L = 0.028085 M.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: when dissolved, each formula unit releases two Na+ and one HPO4^2- and two water molecules. So, yes, each mole of the salt gives one mole of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, now we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. Now, these can react with water to form PO4^3-.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-. So, I need to find [PO4^3-].\n\nTo find this, perhaps I should consider the hydrolysis reactions of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate another proton to become PO4^3-.\n\nBut the relevant equilibrium here is the hydrolysis of HPO4^2- to form PO4^3- and H2O.\n\nThe relevant Ka for this step is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12.\n\nThe reaction is: HPO4^2- + H2O \u2194 PO4^3- + H3O+.\n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, meaning that the extent of hydrolysis is very low.\n\nSo, the [PO4^3-] will be very low, and we can perhaps approximate it by considering the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, the solution also contains H2PO4^-, which can act as a base. Or, more accurately, H2PO4^- can deprotonate to form HPO4^2-, but in this case, we're looking at the deprotonation of HPO4^2- to form PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the overall phosphate equilibrium.\n\nWait, another approach: the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWe can model the system by considering all possible equilibria.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total phosphate concentration and then find the distribution of species based on pH.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to first compute the pH of the solution, because the phosphate species depend on pH.\n\nWait, the solution is a buffer solution because it contains a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, but wait: H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (from the first dissociation), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so that's a buffer system involving the second dissociation (since H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base for the second step).\n\nWait, no: H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). Similarly, HPO4^2- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become PO4^3-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-).\n\nBut in this solution, since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH will be determined by the pKa2 of H3PO4, because we have a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nThe buffer equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nWait, yes, because in the second dissociation, H2PO4^- \u2194 HPO4^2- + H+.\n\nSo, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies here. So, let's compute the pH first.\n\nCompute pKa2: Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) \u2248 7.21 (because log(6.2)=0.79, so 6.2e-8 is 1e-7.21, so pKa2 is approximately 7.21).\n\nWait, wait, no. The pKa is the negative log of Ka. So, pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).\n\nLet me compute that: 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8. Log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So, pKa2 is 7.2076, approximately 7.21.\n\nSo, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nWe have [HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M and [H2PO4^-] = 0.03669 M.\n\nSo, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028085 / 0.03669 \u2248 0.766.\n\nSo, log(0.766) \u2248 -0.113.\n\nSo, pH = 7.21 + (-0.113) \u2248 7.097.\n\nSo, the pH of the solution is approximately 7.10.\n\nNow, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nBecause PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-:\n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+.\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nSo, the expression is Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWe have Ka3 =1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M, and [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.10) \u2248 7.94e-8 M.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (7.94e-8)\n\nLet me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = approx 5.055e-14.\n\nDenominator: 7.94e-8.\n\nSo, 5.055e-14 / 7.94e-8 = approximately (5.055 / 7.94) * 1e-6.\n\n5.055 / 7.94 is about 0.637.\n\nSo, 0.637e-6 = 6.37e-7 M.\n\nWait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me redo the math.\n\nCalculating [PO4^3-]:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.10) = 7.94e-8 M.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / 7.94e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = ?\n\n1.8 * 0.028085 = 0.050553. So, 0.050553e-12 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator: 7.94e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0553e-14 /7.94e-8 = (5.0553 /7.94) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553 /7.94 \u2248 0.637.\n\nSo, 0.637e-6 = 6.37e-7 M.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the closest option is A)6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, D)3.97e-7. So, 6.37e-7 is close to option A (6.24e-7), but let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.\n\nLet me compute [H+] more accurately.\n\npH is 7.097, so [H+] = 10^(-7.097) \u2248 ?\n\n10^(-7) is 1e-7.\n\n0.097 is approximately 0.097, so 10^(-0.097) \u2248 0.87 (since log(8.7) is about 0.94, so 10^(-0.097)= ~0.87).\n\nWait, 10^(-0.097)= 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794, but for 0.097, let's compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula: 10^x \u2248 1 + x * ln(10), but maybe better to just use a calculator-like approach.\n\nWait, I can think of 10^0.097 as e^(0.097 * ln10) \u2248 e^(0.097 * 2.3026) \u2248 e^(0.2237) \u2248 1.250.\n\nWait, wait no, 10^0.097 is the same as e^(0.097 * ln10) \u2248 e^(0.097 * 2.302585) \u2248 e^(0.2237) \u2248 1.250. So, 10^(-0.097) is 1/1.250 \u2248 0.8.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with more accurate figures.\n\nBut maybe I should check if I made a mistake earlier in the approach.\n\nWait, another approach: since PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2- and H2O, perhaps the concentration can be calculated using the Ka3 and the [HPO4^2-].\n\nBut another thought: perhaps the solution isn't only affected by the HPO4^2- hydrolysis but also by the H2PO4^- hydrolysis. Wait, H2PO4^- can hydrolyze to HPO4^2- and H+ as well. But since H2PO4^- has a higher concentration, but its Ka2 is 6.2e-8, which is larger than Ka3.\n\nWait, but perhaps the contribution from H2PO4^- to PO4^3- is negligible compared to HPO4^2-.\n\nBecause H2PO4^- \u2192 HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2=6.2e-8), and HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3=1.8e-12).\n\nSo, the HPO4^2- hydrolysis is much less likely than H2PO4^- hydrolysis. So, the main source of PO4^3- is the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but another possibility: perhaps the solution's pH is determined by both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which form a buffer. So, the pH is around pKa2, which we calculated as 7.10.\n\nSo, perhaps the [PO4^3-] is very low, as we calculated around 6.37e-7 M. But looking at the options, the closest is option A (6.24e-7), but let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, let me do the exact calculation.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.097) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.097) = 1e-7 * (10^(-0.097)).\n\nCompute 10^(-0.097): take natural log.\n\nln(10^(-0.097)) = -0.097 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.097 * 2.302585 \u2248 -0.22375.\n\nSo, e^(-0.22375) \u2248 0.800. So, 10^(-0.097) \u2248 0.8, so [H+] = 8e-8 M.\n\nWait, wait, no: 10^(-7.097) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.097) = 1e-7 * 0.8 \u2248 8e-8 M.\n\nWait, that's 8e-8 M.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8e-8).\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0553e-14 /8e-8 = (5.0553/8) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553 /8 \u2248 0.6319125.\n\nSo, 0.6319125e-6 = 6.319e-7 M.\n\nHmm, so around 6.32e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7). But wait, perhaps the more accurate calculation will bring it closer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the pH more precisely.\n\nWe had [HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M, [H2PO4^-] = 0.03669 M.\n\nThe ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.028085 / 0.03669 = let me compute that exactly.\n\n0.028085 \u00f7 0.03669 \u2248 0.7663.\n\nSo, log(0.7663) = ?\n\nWe can use the approximation: log(0.7663) = log(7.663e-1) = log(7.663) + log(1e-1) = 0.885 + (-1) = -0.115.\n\nSo, pH = pKa2 + (-0.115) = 7.21 - 0.115 = 7.095.\n\nSo, [H+] = 10^(-7.095) \u2248 8.0e-8 M.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute 10^(-7.095) more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 7.095 as 7 + 0.095.\n\n10^(-7.095) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.095).\n\nCompute 10^(-0.095):\n\nTake natural log: ln(10^(-0.095)) = -0.095 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.095 * 2.302585 \u2248 -0.218745.\n\ne^(-0.218745) \u2248 0.803.\n\nSo, 10^(-0.095) \u2248 0.803.\n\nSo, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.803 = 8.03e-8 M.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.03e-8).\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.03e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0553e-14 /8.03e-8 = (5.0553 /8.03) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553 \u00f78.03 \u2248 0.6296.\n\nSo, 0.6296e-6 = 6.296e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.30e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 6.24e-7\n\nB)5.48e-7 \n\nC)2.81e-7 \n\nD)3.97e-7 \n\nSo, 6.30e-7 is closest to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution's volume is 0.2 L, and the moles of PO4^3- would be negligible, so perhaps I should compute the total phosphate species.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the concentrations. Wait, another approach: perhaps the total phosphate concentration comes from both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and any PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but no, the question only asks for [PO4^3-].\n\nWait, but perhaps another consideration: the solution might also have some contribution from H2PO4^- hydrolyzing to form PO4^3-.\n\nBut wait, H2PO4^- hydrolyzes in two steps:\n\nH2PO4^- \u2192 HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2=6.2e-8)\n\nHPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3=1.8e-12)\n\nSo, the contribution from H2PO4^- to PO4^3- is through two steps. But since each step is much more likely, the amount of PO4^3- from H2PO4^- is negligible compared to that from HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, perhaps I can ignore the H2PO4^- contribution.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's compute the [PO4^3-] from H2PO4^-.\n\nH2PO4^- can donate two protons to become PO4^3-.\n\nThe overall reaction is H2PO4^- \u2192 PO4^3- + 2 H+.\n\nThe overall Ka would be Ka2 * Ka3 = 6.2e-8 * 1.8e-12 = 1.116e-19.\n\nSo, the expression for this is:\n\nKa_total = [PO4^3-][H+]^2 / [H2PO4^-]\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (Ka_total * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]^2\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nKa_total = 1.116e-19\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.03669 M\n\n[H+] = 8.03e-8 M.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.116e-19 * 0.03669) / (8.03e-8)^2\n\nCompute numerator: 1.116e-19 * 0.03669 \u2248 4.096e-21.\n\nDenominator: (8.03e-8)^2 \u2248 6.45e-15.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = 4.096e-21 /6.45e-15 \u2248 6.36e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's about 6.36e-7 M, which is similar to what I found earlier. But wait, that can't be right because the two contributions would add up, but this seems to suggest that the H2PO4^- contributes about the same as HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, that can't be correct. Because the HPO4^2- is 0.028 M, and H2PO4^- is 0.0367 M, but the overall Ka for H2PO4^- \u2192 PO4^3- is much smaller than that for HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3-.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.\n\nWait, [PO4^3-] from H2PO4^- would be:\n\nKa_total = ( [PO4^3-] [H+]^2 ) / [H2PO4^-]\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka_total * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]^2.\n\nKa_total is 1.116e-19.\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.03669 M.\n\n[H+] is 8.03e-8, so [H+]^2 = (8.03e-8)^2 = 6.45e-15.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.116e-19 * 0.03669) / 6.45e-15.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.116e-19 * 0.03669 \u2248 4.096e-21.\n\n4.096e-21 /6.45e-15 = approx 6.36e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. But that would imply that the contribution from H2PO4^- is similar to that from HPO4^2-, which seems contradictory because the HPO4^2- has a higher concentration and a higher Ka (for its own hydrolysis) but a lower K for the overall reaction.\n\nWait, no, wait. HPO4^2- hydrolyzes with a Ka3 of 1.8e-12, while H2PO4^- hydrolyzes with a combined Ka of 1.116e-19. So, HPO4^2- is more likely to hydrolyze than H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, both contribute about the same. That doesn't make sense. There must be a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is that I'm considering the overall reaction for H2PO4^- \u2192 PO4^3- as a single step, but in reality, it's two sequential steps, each with their own K. So, the [PO4^3-] from H2PO4^- would be (Ka2 * Ka3 * [H2PO4^-]) / (Ka1 * [H+]^2) ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the contribution from H2PO4^- is negligible compared to HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, let's compute the [PO4^3-] from each source separately.\n\nFrom HPO4^2-:\n\n[PO4^3-]_1 = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\n= (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.03e-8)\n\n\u2248 (5.055e-14) /8.03e-8 \u2248 6.296e-7 M.\n\nFrom H2PO4^-:\n\n[PO4^3-]_2 = (Ka2 * Ka3 * [H2PO4^-]) / ([H+]^2 * (1 + ... )) ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as:\n\nH2PO4^- \u2192 HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2=6.2e-8)\n\nHPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3=1.8e-12)\n\nSo, the overall reaction is H2PO4^- \u2192 PO4^3- + 2 H+.\n\nThe combined Ka is Ka2 * Ka3 = 1.116e-19.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\nKa2*Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]^2 / [H2PO4^-].\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (Ka2*Ka3 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]^2.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nKa2*Ka3 =6.2e-8 *1.8e-12 = 1.116e-19.\n\n[H2PO4^-] =0.03669 M.\n\n[H+] =8.03e-8.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-]_2 = (1.116e-19 * 0.03669) / (8.03e-8)^2.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.116e-19 * 0.03669 \u2248 4.096e-21.\n\nDenominator: (8.03e-8)^2 \u22486.45e-15.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-]_2 = 4.096e-21 /6.45e-15 \u22486.36e-7 M.\n\nWait, but this can't be right because from HPO4^2-, we have [PO4^3-]_1 =6.3e-7, and from H2PO4^- another 6.3e-7. That would make the total [PO4^3-] about 1.26e-6, which is way higher than any option. So, this suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nAh, wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in assuming that the [PO4^3-] from H2PO4^- is independent of that from HPO4^2-. In reality, the [PO4^3-] is a single quantity, so the contributions from both sources should be considered together, not separately.\n\nBut given that the two contributions are similar, perhaps I should think of the system more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028 M and [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M is correct, but the presence of H2PO4^- will also produce some PO4^3- through its own hydrolysis, but perhaps it's negligible compared to the contribution from HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but according to the calculations, both contributions are about 6e-7, which seems contradictory. Because if both contribute equally, the total would be about 1.2e-6, but that's not any of the options. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider all phosphate species together.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = a\n\n[HPO4^2-] = b\n\n[PO4^3-] = c\n\nWe know that the solution contains a + b + c = total phosphate concentration.\n\nBut wait, the total phosphate comes from the two salts.\n\nThe total moles of phosphate from KH2PO4 is 0.007338 mol of H2PO4^-.\n\nThe total moles of phosphate from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 0.005617 mol of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, the total moles of phosphate in solution are 0.007338 + 0.005617 = 0.012955 mol.\n\nSo, total concentration is 0.012955 mol / 0.2 L = 0.064775 M.\n\nSo, a + b + c = 0.064775 M.\n\nBut a = [H2PO4^-] = 0.03669 M (from earlier), and b = 0.028085 M. So, a + b = 0.03669 + 0.028085 = 0.064775 M. So, c = 0.064775 - 0.064775 = 0. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, no, because in reality, some of the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will convert to PO4^3-.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the system with all the equilibria.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the [PO4^3-] is governed by the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-, and the contribution from H2PO4^- is negligible.\n\nSo, using [PO4^3-] \u2248 (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nWhich we calculated as approximately 6.3e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option A)6.24e-7.\n\nBut perhaps more precise calculation would bring it to 6.24e-7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact pH.\n\nLet me compute the pH more accurately.\n\npH = pKa2 + log(b/a)\n\nWhere b = [HPO4^2-] =0.028085, a = [H2PO4^-]=0.03669.\n\nSo, log(0.028085/0.03669)=log(0.7663) = -0.113.\n\nSo, pH=7.21 - 0.113=7.097.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.097) \u2248 8.0e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / 8.0e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.0e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0553e-14 /8.0e-8 =6.319e-7.\n\nHmm, so about 6.32e-7.\n\nBut option A is 6.24e-7, which is close.\n\nWait, perhaps the precise calculation would give a slightly lower value.\n\nWait, let me compute 10^(-7.097) more accurately.\n\n7.097 is 7 + 0.097.\n\nCompute 10^(-0.097):\n\nWe can use the Taylor series expansion for 10^x around x=0.\n\n10^x \u2248 1 + x ln(10) + (x^2 (ln(10))^2)/2 + ... \n\nx= -0.097.\n\nSo,\n\nln(10)=2.302585093.\n\nx ln(10)= -0.097 * 2.302585 \u2248 -0.22375.\n\nx^2 (ln(10))^2 = (0.097)^2 * (2.302585)^2 \u2248 0.009409 * 5.3019 \u2248 0.050.\n\nSo,\n\n10^(-0.097) \u2248 1 + (-0.22375) + (0.050)/2 = 1 - 0.22375 + 0.025 = 0.80125.\n\nSo, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.80125 = 8.0125e-8.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) /8.0125e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.\n\nDenominator:8.0125e-8.\n\n5.0553e-14 /8.0125e-8 = (5.0553 /8.0125) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0553 \u00f78.0125 \u2248 0.6308.\n\nSo, 0.6308e-6 =6.308e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.31e-7 M.\n\nSo, this is very close to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nBut perhaps I should consider the exact value using more precise calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] concentrations.\n\nWait, the solution is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters.\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007338 mol.\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O:1.00g /177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005617 mol.\n\nSo, [H2PO4^-] =0.007338 /0.2 =0.03669 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] =0.005617 /0.2 =0.028085 M.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 6.24e-7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the [PO4^3-] calculation more accurately.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the initial concentrations are correct, and the [PO4^3-] is indeed approximately 6.3e-7, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is about half of 6.3e-7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the buffer calculation.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the solution isn't a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- but between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.\n\nBut that would be incorrect because the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by their ratio, which is the pKa2.\n\nWait, but perhaps the pH is around pKa2, so the [H+] is around 1e-7, which is what I used.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but that would require a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the orthophosphate is the sum of all species beyond HPO4^2-, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which species contribute to orthophosphate.\n\nWait, perhaps orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.\n\nNo, no.

So, the closest option is A (6.24e-7).\n\nBut perhaps the exact calculation would give 6.24e-7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the [H+] is 8.0e-8, leading to [PO4^3-] of (1.8e-12 *0.028085)/(8.0e-8) = (5.0553e-14)/(8e-8) = 6.32e-7.\n\nBut since the options don't have this exact value, perhaps the correct answer is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, 3.97e-7, but I can't see how that would come about.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hydrolysis step. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the reaction is HPO4^2- + H2O \u2194 PO4^3- + H3O+.\n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is [PO4^3-][H3O+]/[HPO4^2-].\n\nRearranged, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nKa3 =1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] =0.028085 M.\n\n[H+]=8.0e-8.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028085) /8.0e-8.\n\nWhich is (5.0553e-14)/8.0e-8 =6.319e-7.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nBut perhaps the exact value, when computed precisely, gives 6.24e-7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028085 M, but due to hydrolysis, the actual concentration is slightly less, which would increase [PO4^3-].\n\nBut given the problem's options, I think the intended answer is option A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation equilibria of the given salts and the hydrolysis of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH\u2082PO\u2084 and 1.00 g of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O, with a total volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3 (0.2 L). The molecular weights are 136.09 g/mol for KH\u2082PO\u2084 and 177.99 g/mol for Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The dissociation constants for H\u2083PO\u2084 are provided as Ka\u2081 = 7.5\u00d710\u207b\u00b3, Ka\u2082 = 6.2\u00d710\u207b\u2078, and Ka\u2083 = 1.8\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u00b2.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b\n- Moles of KH\u2082PO\u2084:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Moles} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Molar Mass}} = \\frac{1.00}{136.09} \\approx 0.007338 \\, \\text{mol}\n  \\]  \n  Concentration of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b:  \n  \\[\n  [\\text{H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b}] = \\frac{\\text{Moles}}{\\text{Volume (L)}} = \\frac{0.007338}{0.2} \\approx 0.03669 \\, \\text{M}\n  \\]\n\n- Moles of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Moles} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Molar Mass}} = \\frac{1.00}{177.99} \\approx 0.005617 \\, \\text{mol}\n  \\]  \n  Concentration of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b:  \n  \\[\n  [\\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b}] = \\frac{\\text{Moles}}{\\text{Volume (L)}} = \\frac{0.005617}{0.2} \\approx 0.028085 \\, \\text{M}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the pH of the solution\nThe solution contains H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, forming a buffer system.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Both are 1.00 grams each, and the volume is 200.00 cm\u00b3. The temperature is 25\u00b0C. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. The options are four different concentrations, and I need to pick the right one.\n\nHmm, orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-, right? But wait, I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. So, I think the solution might be related to the buffer system here. Let me think about the salts present.\n\nKH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4), so when dissolved, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium phosphate dihydrogen dodecahydrate? Or wait, no. Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. But since it's the dihydrate, does that affect the molarity? Maybe not, because the H2O would just add to the mass, but when calculating moles, the water doesn't contribute to the ions, so I can treat it as Na2HPO4 for the purpose of finding moles.\n\nSo, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These are adjacent in the phosphate ion's dissociation steps. So, the solution is a buffer solution because it contains a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nH3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It can donate three protons. So, the first dissociation is H3PO4 \u2192 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- \u2192 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- \u2192 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12).\n\nSo, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. These two can act as a buffer because they are a conjugate acid-base pair. H2PO4^- is the acid (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So the pH of the solution will depend on the ratio of these two concentrations.\n\nWait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-. But wait, if the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, then the PO4^3- concentration might be very low because it's the third dissociation step, which has a very small Ka (1.8e-12). So, maybe the PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2- losing another proton.\n\nBut in a buffer solution, the HPO4^2- would be the dominant species. So, the PO4^3- would be minimal, but perhaps we can calculate it using the third Ka.\n\nWait, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's first figure out the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n\nFirst, calculate the moles of each salt.\n\nFor KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007335 mol.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005605 mol.\n\nSo, each salt dissociates completely in solution. So, KH2PO4 gives 1 mole of H2PO4^- per mole of KH2PO4. Similarly, Na2HPO4 gives 1 mole of HPO4^2- per mole of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nSo, moles of H2PO4^- = 0.007335 mol, and moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005605 mol.\n\nThe volume is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.200 L.\n\nSo, concentrations:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.200 \u2248 0.036675 M\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005605 / 0.200 \u2248 0.028025 M\n\nNow, since these two are a conjugate acid-base pair (H2PO4^- / HPO4^2-), the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, the problem isn't directly asking for pH, but the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nHmm, but to find PO4^3-, perhaps I should consider the third dissociation step. HPO4^2- can donate another proton to become PO4^3-.\n\nThe reaction is: HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)\n\nSo, in solution, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028025 M. But wait, wait. The solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by the ratio of these two. Once I find the pH, I can then find [PO4^3-] using the third Ka.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can first find the pH using the buffer equation, then use that pH to calculate [PO4^3-].\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation:\n\npKa2 = log(Ka2) = log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.208\n\nThe equation is pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nHere, HA is H2PO4^- (the acid), and A- is HPO4^2- (the conjugate base).\n\nSo, [A-] is [HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M, [HA] is [H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M.\n\nSo, log(0.028025 / 0.036675) = log(0.7643) \u2248 -0.113.\n\nSo, pH = 7.208 - 0.113 \u2248 7.095.\n\nNow, with pH known, can we find [PO4^3-]?\n\nYes, because the third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12, and pH is 7.095.\n\nThe H+ concentration is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.095) \u2248 8.23e-8 M.\n\nSo, the expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.\n\nWe can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M\n\n[H+] = 8.23e-8 M\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028025) / (8.23e-8)\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, multiply 1.8e-12 by 0.028025:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.028025 \u2248 (1.8 * 0.028025) e-12 \u2248 0.050445e-12 = 5.0445e-14.\n\nThen, divide by 8.23e-8:\n\n5.0445e-14 / 8.23e-8 \u2248 (5.0445 / 8.23) * 1e-6 \u2248 approximately 0.6127 * 1e-6 = 6.127e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's about 6.13e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the numbers more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute [HPO4^2-] = 0.005605 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028025 M. That's correct.\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M. Correct.\n\nHenderson equation:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA])\n\npKa2 = log(6.2e-8) = 7.2076 (since 10^7.2076 = 1.6e7? Wait, no. Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 * 1e-8. So pKa2 is log(6.2) + (-8) = 0.7924 - 8 = -7.2076? Wait, no, no. Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So Ka is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).\n\nLog(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 - 8 = -7.2076. But pKa is the negative log, so pKa2 = 7.2076. Correct.\n\nThen, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.028025 / 0.036675 \u2248 0.7643.\n\nLog(0.7643) is approximately log(0.7643). Let's compute that accurately.\n\nLog(0.7643) = log(7.643e-1) \u2248  log(7.643) + log(1e-1) \u2192 0.8841 (since log(7.643)= ~0.8841) minus 1 \u2192 -0.1159.\n\nWait, more accurately: 10^(-0.1159) \u2248 0.7643. So log(0.7643) \u2248 -0.1159.\n\nSo pH = 7.2076 + (-0.1159) = 7.0917.\n\nSo pH is approximately 7.0917.\n\nThen, [H+] = 10^(-7.0917) = 10^(-7 - 0.0917) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.0917). What's 10^(-0.0917)?\n\nWe know that 10^(-0.1) \u2248 0.794. So 0.0917 is a bit less than 0.1. Let's compute 10^(-0.0917).\n\nApproximating, let's compute ln(10^(-0.0917))= -0.0917 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.0917 * 2.3026 \u2248 -0.2111.\n\nSo e^(-0.2111) \u2248 0.810. Alternatively, 10^(-0.0917) \u2248 0.81.\n\nWait, but maybe a better way is to compute 10^0.0917.\n\nWait, 10^0.09 is approximately 1.228. Because 10^0.1 is about 1.2589. Let me see:\n\nLet me use a calculator approach.\n\nWe can compute 10^0.0917:\n\nUsing log tables or a calculator:\n\nWe know that 10^0.07 \u2248 1.1746\n\n10^0.08 \u2248 1.1996\n\n10^0.09 \u2248 1.2285\n\n10^0.0917 is a bit higher than 1.2285.\n\nLet me compute using natural logs.\n\nx = 0.0917\n\nln(10^x) = x * ln(10) \u2248 0.0917 * 2.3026 \u2248 0.2112.\n\ne^0.2112 \u2248 1.2345.\n\nSo 10^0.0917 = e^(0.2112) \u2248 1.2345.\n\nThus, 10^-0.0917 = 1 / 1.2345 \u2248 0.810.\n\nSo [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.810 \u2248 8.10e-8 M.\n\nWait, but earlier I approximated it as 8.23e-8. Hmm, perhaps my approximation was a bit off. Let's say approximately 8.1e-8.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M.\n\n[H+] = 8.1e-8 M.\n\nSo,\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.028025) / 8.1e-8 = ?\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028025 = (1.8 * 0.028025) e-12 = 0.050445e-12 = 5.0445e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.1e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0445e-14 / 8.1e-8 = (5.0445 / 8.1) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0445 / 8.1 \u2248 0.6227.\n\nSo, 0.6227e-6 = 6.227e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. That's very close.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the exponents.\n\nWait, 1.8e-12 * 0.028025 = let me compute 1.8 * 0.028025 = 0.050445, so 5.0445e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.1e-8: 5.0445e-14 / 8.1e-8 = (5.0445 / 8.1) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0445 / 8.1 = 0.62277... So, 0.62277e-6 = 6.2277e-7 M.\n\nSo approximately 6.23e-7 M. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So the correct answer would be A.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the buffer. Because the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is around 7.09, which is in the region where the third deprotonation (to PO4^3-) is possible. But since the pH is about 7.1, which is higher than pKa3.\n\nWait, what is pKa3? Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 = 11.74.\n\nSo, pH is 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3. That means that the solution is acidic compared to pKa3. So, the HPO4^2- would tend to donate a proton, but since the pH is lower than pKa3, the predominant form would be HPO4^2- rather than PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but the calculation we did earlier gives [PO4^3-] as about 6.2e-7 M. So, that's the concentration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total concentration of all phosphate species, but the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I should calculate the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation step.\n\nWait, but the approach I took earlier seems correct. So, the calculation leads to approximately 6.23e-7 M, which matches option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.\n\nWait, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.028025 / 0.036675. Let me compute that accurately.\n\n0.028025 / 0.036675 = ?\n\nDividing 28025 by 36675. Let me compute 28025 / 36675 \u2248 0.7643.\n\nSo, log(0.7643) \u2248 -0.1159.\n\npH = 7.2076 - 0.1159 = 7.0917, which I had earlier.\n\nSo, [H+] = 10^-7.0917 \u2248 8.1e-8.\n\nSo, the calculation for [PO4^3-] is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again: the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but HPO4^2- can dissociate further into PO4^3- and H+. So, the PO4^3- concentration is determined by the third dissociation, which is dependent on the pH.\n\nSo, using the Ka3 expression, which is:\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.\n\nSo, with [HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M, and [H+] = 8.1e-8, the calculation gives 6.227e-7 M, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close to my result.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the molar masses or moles.\n\nWait, let me double-check the moles.\n\nKH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.\n\n136.09 g is 136.09, so 1.00 / 136.09 = approximately 0.007335 mol. Correct.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005605 mol. Correct.\n\nSo, the concentrations are 0.036675 M and 0.028025 M. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my approach is correct, and the answer should be option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Both are 1.00 grams each, and the volume is 200.00 cm\u00b3. The temperature is 25\u00b0C. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. The options are four different concentrations, and I need to pick the right one.\n\nHmm, orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-, right? But wait, I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. So, I think the solution might be related to the buffer system here. Let me think about the salts present.\n\nKH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4), so when dissolved, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium phosphate dihydrogen dodecahydrate? Or wait, no. Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. But since it's the dihydrate, does that affect the molarity? Maybe not, because the H2O would just add to the mass, but when calculating moles, the water doesn't contribute to the ions, so I can treat it as Na2HPO4 for the purpose of finding moles.\n\nSo, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These are adjacent in the phosphate ion's dissociation steps. So, the solution is a buffer solution because it contains a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nH3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It can donate three protons. So, the first dissociation is H3PO4 \u2192 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- \u2192 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- \u2192 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12).\n\nSo, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. These two can act as a buffer because they are a conjugate acid-base pair. H2PO4^- is the acid (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So the pH of the solution will depend on the ratio of these two concentrations.\n\nWait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-. But wait, if the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, then the PO4^3- concentration might be very low because it's the third dissociation step, which has a very small Ka (1.8e-12). So, maybe the PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2- losing another proton.\n\nBut in a buffer solution, the HPO4^2- would be the dominant species. So, the PO4^3- would be minimal, but perhaps we can calculate it using the third Ka.\n\nWait, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's first figure out the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n\nFirst, calculate the moles of each salt.\n\nFor KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007335 mol.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005605 mol.\n\nSo, each salt dissociates completely in solution. So, KH2PO4 gives 1 mole of H2PO4^- per mole of KH2PO4. Similarly, Na2HPO4 gives 1 mole of HPO4^2- per mole of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nSo, moles of H2PO4^- = 0.007335 mol, and moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005605 mol.\n\nThe volume is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.200 L.\n\nSo, concentrations:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.200 \u2248 0.036675 M\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005605 / 0.200 \u2248 0.028025 M\n\nNow, since these two are a conjugate acid-base pair (H2PO4^- / HPO4^2-), the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, the problem isn't directly asking for pH, but the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nHmm, but to find PO4^3-, perhaps I should consider the third dissociation step. HPO4^2- can donate another proton to become PO4^3-.\n\nThe reaction is: HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)\n\nSo, in solution, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028025 M. But wait, wait. The solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by the ratio of these two. Once I find the pH, I can then find [PO4^3-] using the third Ka.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can first find the pH using the buffer equation, then use that pH to calculate [PO4^3-].\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation:\n\npKa2 = log(Ka2) = log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.208\n\nThe equation is pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nHere, HA is H2PO4^- (the acid), and A- is HPO4^2- (the conjugate base).\n\nSo, [A-] is [HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M, [HA] is [H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M.\n\nSo, log(0.028025 / 0.036675) = log(0.7643) \u2248 -0.113.\n\nSo, pH = 7.208 - 0.113 \u2248 7.095.\n\nNow, with pH known, can we find [PO4^3-]?\n\nYes, because the third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12, and pH is 7.095.\n\nThe H+ concentration is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.095) \u2248 8.23e-8 M.\n\nSo, the expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.\n\nWe can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M\n\n[H+] = 8.23e-8 M\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028025) / (8.23e-8)\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, multiply 1.8e-12 by 0.028025:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.028025 \u2248 (1.8 * 0.028025) e-12 \u2248 0.050445e-12 = 5.0445e-14.\n\nThen, divide by 8.23e-8:\n\n5.0445e-14 / 8.23e-8 \u2248 (5.0445 / 8.23) * 1e-6 \u2248 approximately 0.6127 * 1e-6 = 6.127e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's about 6.13e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the numbers more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute [HPO4^2-] = 0.005605 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028025 M. That's correct.\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M. Correct.\n\nHenderson equation:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA])\n\npKa2 = log(6.2e-8) = 7.2076 (since 10^7.2076 = 1.6e7? Wait, no. Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 * 1e-8. So pKa2 is log(6.2) + (-8) = 0.7924 - 8 = -7.2076? Wait, no, no. Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So Ka is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).\n\nLog(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 - 8 = -7.2076. But pKa is the negative log, so pKa2 = 7.2076. Correct.\n\nThen, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.028025 / 0.036675 \u2248 0.7643.\n\nLog(0.7643) is approximately log(0.7643). Let's compute that accurately.\n\nLog(0.7643) = log(7.643e-1) \u2248  log(7.643) + log(1e-1) \u2192 0.8841 (since log(7.643)= ~0.8841) minus 1 \u2192 -0.1159.\n\nWait, more accurately: 10^(-0.1159) \u2248 0.7643. So log(0.7643) \u2248 -0.1159.\n\nSo pH = 7.2076 + (-0.1159) = 7.0917.\n\nSo pH is approximately 7.0917.\n\nThen, [H+] = 10^(-7.0917) = 10^(-7 - 0.0917) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.0917). What's 10^(-0.0917)?\n\nWe know that 10^(-0.1) \u2248 0.794. So 0.0917 is a bit less than 0.1. Let's compute 10^(-0.0917).\n\nApproximating, let's compute ln(10^(-0.0917))= -0.0917 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.0917 * 2.3026 \u2248 -0.2111.\n\nSo e^(-0.2111) \u2248 0.810. Alternatively, 10^(-0.0917) \u2248 0.81.\n\nWait, but maybe a better way is to compute 10^0.0917.\n\nWait, 10^0.09 is approximately 1.228. Because 10^0.1 is about 1.2589. Let me see:\n\nLet me use a calculator approach.\n\nWe can compute 10^0.0917:\n\nUsing log tables or a calculator:\n\nWe know that 10^0.07 \u2248 1.1746\n\n10^0.08 \u2248 1.1996\n\n10^0.09 \u2248 1.2285\n\n10^0.0917 is a bit higher than 1.2285.\n\nLet me compute using natural logs.\n\nx = 0.0917\n\nln(10^x) = x * ln(10) \u2248 0.0917 * 2.3026 \u2248 0.2112.\n\ne^0.2112 \u2248 1.2345.\n\nSo 10^0.0917 = e^(0.2112) \u2248 1.2345.\n\nThus, 10^-0.0917 = 1 / 1.2345 \u2248 0.810.\n\nSo [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.810 \u2248 8.10e-8 M.\n\nWait, but earlier I approximated it as 8.23e-8. Hmm, perhaps my approximation was a bit off. Let's say approximately 8.1e-8.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M.\n\n[H+] = 8.1e-8 M.\n\nSo,\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.028025) / 8.1e-8 = ?\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028025 = (1.8 * 0.028025) e-12 = 0.050445e-12 = 5.0445e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.1e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0445e-14 / 8.1e-8 = (5.0445 / 8.1) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0445 / 8.1 \u2248 0.6227.\n\nSo, 0.6227e-6 = 6.227e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. That's very close.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the exponents.\n\nWait, 1.8e-12 * 0.028025 = let me compute 1.8 * 0.028025 = 0.050445, so 5.0445e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.1e-8: 5.0445e-14 / 8.1e-8 = (5.0445 / 8.1) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0445 / 8.1 = 0.62277... So, 0.62277e-6 = 6.2277e-7 M.\n\nSo approximately 6.23e-7 M. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So the correct answer would be A.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the buffer. Because the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is around 7.09, which is in the region where the third deprotonation (to PO4^3-) is possible. But since the pH is about 7.1, which is higher than pKa3.\n\nWait, what is pKa3? Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 = 11.74.\n\nSo, pH is 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3. That means that the solution is acidic compared to pKa3. So, the HPO4^2- would tend to donate a proton, but since the pH is lower than pKa3, the predominant form would be HPO4^2- rather than PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but the calculation we did earlier gives [PO4^3-] as about 6.2e-7 M. So, that's the concentration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total concentration of all phosphate species, but the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I should calculate the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation step.\n\nWait, but the approach I took earlier seems correct. So, the calculation leads to approximately 6.23e-7 M, which matches option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.\n\nWait, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.028025 / 0.036675. Let me compute that accurately.\n\n0.028025 / 0.036675 = ?\n\nDividing 28025 by 36675. Let me compute 28025 / 36675 \u2248 0.7643.\n\nSo, log(0.7643) \u2248 -0.1159.\n\npH = 7.2076 - 0.1159 = 7.0917, which I had earlier.\n\nSo, [H+] = 10^-7.0917 \u2248 8.1e-8.\n\nSo, the calculation for [PO4^3-] is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again: the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but HPO4^2- can dissociate further into PO4^3- and H+. So, the PO4^3- concentration is determined by the third dissociation, which is dependent on the pH.\n\nSo, using the Ka3 expression, which is:\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.\n\nSo, with [HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M, and [H+] = 8.1e-8, the calculation gives 6.227e-7 M, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close to my result.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the molar masses or moles.\n\nWait, let me double-check the moles.\n\nKH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.\n\n136.09 g is 136.09, so 1.00 / 136.09 = approximately 0.007335 mol. Correct.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005605 mol. Correct.\n\nSo, the concentrations are 0.036675 M and 0.028025 M. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my approach is correct, and the answer should be option A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use the third dissociation constant of phosphoric acid (Ka\u2083). The solution contains 1.00 g each of KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O, with a total volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3 (0.200 L).
