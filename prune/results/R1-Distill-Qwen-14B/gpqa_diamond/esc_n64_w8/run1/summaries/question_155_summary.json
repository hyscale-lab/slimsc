      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the Pz operator. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nThe problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -\u0127. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. I need to find the uncertainty \u0394Pz.\n\nWait, right. The uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula \u0394A = sqrt(\u27e8A\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8A\u27e9\u00b2). So for Pz, I need to find \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 and \u27e8Pz\u27e9, then take the square root of their difference.\n\nBut first, I should probably write down the given matrices. Let me see. The matrix for Px is given, but since the system is in an eigenstate of Px, maybe I don't need it directly. The state is already given, so maybe I can work with that.\n\nThe state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T. So that's a 3-component vector. Since the basis is the eigenvectors of Pz, which are orthogonal and presumably form a basis, I can treat this as a 3-level system.\n\nWait, but Pz's matrix is diagonal. Let me write that down. Pz is diagonal with entries \u0127, 0, -\u0127. So the eigenvalues are \u0127, 0, -\u0127. That makes sense because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, so when Pz acts on them, it just gives the eigenvalue.\n\nSo, to compute \u27e8Pz\u27e9, I need to calculate the expectation value of Pz in the state |\u03c8>. Since |\u03c8> is a column vector, I can compute this as \u03c8\u2020 Pz \u03c8.\n\nSimilarly, \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 is \u03c8\u2020 Pz\u00b2 \u03c8. But since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared is just the squares of the diagonal elements. So for Pz\u00b2, the diagonal elements would be (\u0127)^2, 0^2, (-\u0127)^2. So Pz\u00b2 is diag(\u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2).\n\nSo let me compute \u27e8Pz\u27e9 first. The state vector is [ a, b, c ] where a = -1/2, b = 1/\u221a2, c = -1/2.\n\n\u27e8Pz\u27e9 = a*(\u0127) + b*(0) + c*(-\u0127) = a\u0127 - c\u0127.\n\nSubstituting the values: a is -1/2, c is -1/2. So,\n\n\u27e8Pz\u27e9 = (-1/2)\u0127 - (-1/2)\u0127 = (-1/2 +1/2) \u0127 = 0. So \u27e8Pz\u27e9 is zero. That makes things simpler because when calculating the uncertainty, the \u27e8Pz\u27e9 term will be zero, so \u0394Pz = sqrt(\u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 - (\u27e8Pz\u27e9)^2) = sqrt(\u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9).\n\nSo now I just need to find \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9.\n\n\u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 is a^2*(\u0127)^2 + b^2*(0)^2 + c^2*(\u0127)^2 = a\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2 + c\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute a\u00b2 and c\u00b2. a is (-1/2), so a\u00b2 is (1/4). Similarly, c is (-1/2), so c\u00b2 is also 1/4.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/4) \u0127\u00b2 + (1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (2/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u0394Pz is sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = (\u0127) * sqrt(1/2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The state vector is normalized, right? Let me check that the components squared add up to 1.\n\na\u00b2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. b\u00b2 is (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2. c\u00b2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So 1/4 + 1/2 +1/4 = (1 + 2 +1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.\n\nSo I think the uncertainty is \u0127 / sqrt(2). Looking at the options, that's option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nThe problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, \u0394P_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula \u0394P_z = sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.\n\nFirst, let me understand the setup. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means we're dealing with the standard computational basis where P_z is diagonal.\n\nLooking at the matrices provided:\n\nP_x matrix:\nRow 1: 0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: \u0127/\u221a2, 0, \u0127/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0\n\nP_y matrix:\nRow 1: 0, -i\u0127/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: i\u0127/\u221a2, 0, -i\u0127/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, i\u0127/\u221a2, 0\n\nP_z matrix:\nRow 1: \u0127, 0, 0\nRow 2: 0, 0, 0\nRow 3: 0, 0, -\u0127\n\nWait, so P_z is diagonal, which makes sense because its eigenvectors are the basis vectors. So the state given is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That should make things easier because measuring P_z in this basis will be straightforward.\n\nThe state is |\u03c8> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. Let me check if this is normalized. The norm would be the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.\n\nCalculating the norm:\n(-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 makes 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.\n\nNow, to find the expectation value of P_z, \u27e8P_z\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is just the sum of each component multiplied by its eigenvalue.\n\nThe components are:\n\nComponent 1: -1/2, which is in the first basis state, which has eigenvalue \u0127.\nComponent 2: 1/sqrt(2), in the second basis state, which has eigenvalue 0.\nComponent 3: -1/2, in the third basis state, which has eigenvalue -\u0127.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (-1/2)*\u0127 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*(-\u0127)\nSimplify:\n= (-\u0127/2) + 0 + (\u0127/2)\n= (-\u0127/2 + \u0127/2) = 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is 0.\n\nNext, I need to find \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, its square is also diagonal, with each diagonal element being the square of the original eigenvalues.\n\nSo P_z\u00b2 would have diagonal entries (\u0127)^2, 0^2, (-\u0127)^2 \u2192 \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nThen, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding (eigenvalue squared):\n\n= (-1/2)^2 * \u0127\u00b2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 + (-1/2)^2 * \u0127\u00b2\n= (1/4)\u0127\u00b2 + 0 + (1/4)\u0127\u00b2\n= (1/2)\u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo now, \u0394P_z = sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - (\u27e8P_z\u27e9)^2) ) = sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = (\u0127) * sqrt(1/2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did this correctly. Since the state is a combination of |+z> and |-z>, with coefficients -1/2 each, and the middle state is |0> with coefficient 1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo when we calculate \u27e8P_z\u27e9, each term is (coefficient)^* * (eigenvalue). Since the eigenvalues are \u0127, 0, -\u0127.\n\nSo first term: (-1/2) * \u0127 \u2192 -\u0127/2.\nThird term: (-1/2) * (-\u0127) \u2192 \u0127/2.\nSum is zero.\n\nFor \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9, each coefficient squared times eigenvalue squared. So ( (-1/2)^2 )*(\u0127\u00b2) \u2192 (1/4) \u0127\u00b2, and same for the third term. So 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2, so 1/2 \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) ) = (\u0127) / sqrt(2).\n\nLooking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.\n",

So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.\n\nFirst, let me understand the setup. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means we're dealing with the standard computational basis where P_z is diagonal.\n\nLooking at the matrices provided:\n\nP_x matrix:\nRow 1: 0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: \u0127/\u221a2, 0, \u0127/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0\n\nP_y matrix:\nRow 1: 0, -i\u0127/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: i\u0127/\u221a2, 0, -i\u0127/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, i\u0127/\u221a2, 0\n\nP_z matrix:\nRow 1: \u0127, 0, 0\nRow 2: 0, 0, 0\nRow 3: 0, 0, -\u0127\n\nWait, so P_z is diagonal, which makes sense because its eigenvectors are the basis vectors. So the state given is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That should make things easier because measuring P_z in this basis will be straightforward.\n\nThe state is |\u03c8> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. Let me check if this is normalized. The norm would be the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.\n\nCalculating the norm:\n(-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 makes 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.\n\nNow, to find the expectation value of P_z, \u27e8P_z\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is just the sum of each component multiplied by its eigenvalue.\n\nThe components are:\n\nComponent 1: -1/2, which is in the first basis state, which has eigenvalue \u0127.\nComponent 2: 1/sqrt(2), in the second basis state, which has eigenvalue 0.\nComponent 3: -1/2, in the third basis state, which has eigenvalue -\u0127.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (-1/2)*\u0127 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*(-\u0127)\nSimplify:\n= (-\u0127/2) + 0 + (\u0127/2)\n= (-\u0127/2 + \u0127/2) = 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is 0.\n\nNext, I need to find \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, its square is also diagonal, with each diagonal element being the square of the original eigenvalues.\n\nSo P_z\u00b2 would have diagonal entries (\u0127)^2, 0^2, (-\u0127)^2 \u2192 \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nThen, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding (eigenvalue squared):\n\n= (-1/2)^2 * \u0127\u00b2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 + (-1/2)^2 * \u0127\u00b2\n= (1/4)\u0127\u00b2 + 0 + (1/4)\u0127\u00b2\n= (1/2)\u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo now, \u0394P_z = sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - (\u27e8P_z\u27e9)^2) ) = sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = (\u0127) * sqrt(1/2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did this correctly. Since the state is a combination of |+z> and |-z>, with coefficients -1/2 each, and the middle state is |0> with coefficient 1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo when we calculate \u27e8P_z\u27e9, each term is (coefficient)^* * (eigenvalue). Since the eigenvalues are \u0127, 0, -\u0127.\n\nSo first term: (-1/2) * \u0127 \u2192 -\u0127/2.\nThird term: (-1/2) * (-\u0127) \u2192 \u0127/2.\nSum is zero.\n\nFor \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9, each coefficient squared times eigenvalue squared. So ( (-1/2)^2 )*(\u0127\u00b2) \u2192 (1/4) \u0127\u00b2, and same for the third term. So 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2, so 1/2 \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) ) = (\u0127) / sqrt(2).\n\nLooking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.\n\n\nTo calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$, $\\langle P_z \\rangle$\nThe state of the system is given as:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\\hbar$, $0$, and $-\\hbar$, corresponding to the three basis states. Since the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is computed as:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(0) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(-\\hbar).\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = -\\frac{\\hbar}{2} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$\nThe operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal in the same basis, with eigenvalues $\\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\hbar^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 (0) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\hbar^2.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4}\\hbar^2 + 0 + \\frac{1}{4}\\hbar^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$\nUsing the formula for uncertainty:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar^2 - 0} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar^2} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

The question is asking for the uncertainty \u0394P_z, which is the square root of the variance of P_z.\n\nWait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). So I think I need to calculate the expectation value of P_z squared and the square of the expectation value of P_z, then take the square root of their difference.\n\nBut wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. So to find \u0394P_z, I need to compute <P_z\u00b2> - <P_z>\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I should probably find the expectation value <P_z>. That's the state vector multiplied by P_z matrix, then dotted with the state vector again. But wait, actually, the expectation value is the conjugate transpose (bra) multiplied by the operator acting on the ket. Oh right, so <A> = \u03c8\u2020 A \u03c8.\n\nWait, but the state vector given is a column vector. So the bra vector is its conjugate transpose. Let me write down the state vector \u03c8:\n\n\u03c8 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T.\n\nSo the bra vector is \u03c8\u2020 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ].\n\nWait, but are the elements real? Looking back, the state vector elements are all real, so the bra is just the transpose.\n\nNow, the P_z matrix is diagonal with entries [\u0127, 0, -\u0127]. So P_z \u03c8 would be:\n\nFirst element: \u0127 * (-1/2) = -\u0127/2,\n\nSecond element: 0 * (1/\u221a2) = 0,\n\nThird element: (-\u0127) * (-1/2) = \u0127/2.\n\nSo P_z \u03c8 = [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ]^T.\n\nNow, the expectation value <P_z> is \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. So that's the dot product of \u03c8 and P_z \u03c8.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(-1/2) * (-\u0127/2) = (1/2)(\u0127/2) = \u0127/4,\n\n(1/\u221a2) * 0 = 0,\n\n(-1/2) * (\u0127/2) = (-1/2)(\u0127/2) = -\u0127/4.\n\nAdding them up: \u0127/4 + 0 - \u0127/4 = 0. So <P_z> is zero.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Now, I need to find <P_z\u00b2>. So I'll compute P_z squared acting on \u03c8, then take the expectation.\n\nBut wait, P_z squared is just P_z multiplied by P_z. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z\u00b2 will have the squares of the diagonal elements. So P_z\u00b2 is diag( (\u0127)^2, 0, (\u0127)^2 ).\n\nSo P_z\u00b2 \u03c8 is:\n\nFirst element: (\u0127^2) * (-1/2) = -\u0127\u00b2/2,\n\nSecond element: 0 * (1/\u221a2) = 0,\n\nThird element: (\u0127^2) * (-1/2) = -\u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me correct that. The third element of P_z is -\u0127, so when squared, it's ( -\u0127 )\u00b2 = \u0127\u00b2. So P_z\u00b2 \u03c8 is:\n\nFirst element: \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2) = -\u0127\u00b2/2,\n\nSecond element: 0,\n\nThird element: \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2) = -\u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the third element of \u03c8 is -1/2, so when multiplied by ( -\u0127 )\u00b2 (which is \u0127\u00b2 ), it's (-1/2) * \u0127\u00b2 = - \u0127\u00b2 / 2.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me re-calculate P_z squared.\n\nP_z is [[\u0127, 0, 0], [0,0,0], [0,0,-\u0127]]. So P_z squared is [[\u0127\u00b2, 0, 0], [0,0,0], [0,0, \u0127\u00b2 ]]. Because (-\u0127)^2 is \u0127^2.\n\nSo when you multiply P_z squared by \u03c8, you get:\n\nFirst component: \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2) = - \u0127\u00b2 / 2,\n\nSecond component: 0,\n\nThird component: \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2) = - \u0127\u00b2 / 2.\n\nSo P_z\u00b2 \u03c8 is [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ]^T.\n\nNow, the expectation value <P_z\u00b2> is \u03c8\u2020 P_z\u00b2 \u03c8. So the dot product of \u03c8 and P_z\u00b2 \u03c8.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(-1/2) * (-\u0127\u00b2/2) = (1/2)(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2 /4,\n\n(1/\u221a2) * 0 = 0,\n\n(-1/2) * (-\u0127\u00b2/2) = (1/2)(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2 /4.\n\nAdding them up: \u0127\u00b2/4 + 0 + \u0127\u00b2/4 = \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nSo <P_z\u00b2> is \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nSince <P_z> is zero, the variance is <P_z\u00b2> - (<P_z>)^2 = \u0127\u00b2/2 - 0 = \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is the square root of the variance, which is sqrt( \u0127\u00b2/2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nLooking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2).

So the answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle$\nThe state vector is given as:\n\n\\[\n\\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal:\n\n\\[\nP_z = \\begin{bmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe action of $P_z$ on $\\psi$ is:\n\n\\[\nP_z \\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is the dot product of $\\psi$ and $P_z \\psi$:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger P_z \\psi = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(0) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\right).\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$\nThe matrix for $P_z^2$ is:\n\n\\[\nP_z^2 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe action of $P_z^2$ on $\\psi$ is:\n\n\\[\nP_z^2 \\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ is the dot product of $\\psi$ and $P_z^2 \\psi$:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger P_z^2 \\psi = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(0) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\right).\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$\nThe variance is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Var}(P_z) = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe uncertainty is the square root of the variance:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(P_z)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem is about finding the uncertainty in P_z, which is denoted as \u0394P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue, and I'm given the state vector. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the standard deviation formula, which involves the expectation values of the operator and its square.\n\nSo, first, I think I need to recall the formula for uncertainty. The uncertainty \u0394A in an operator A is sqrt(\u27e8A\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8A\u27e9\u00b2). Since the state is given, I can compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.\n\nThe state vector is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). I'll denote this as |\u03c8\u27e9. The operator P_z has a matrix form given as:\n\nP_z = [[\u0127, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, -\u0127]]\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The matrix form of P_z is given as first row (\u0127,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-\u0127). So it's a diagonal matrix with \u0127, 0, -\u0127 on the diagonal.\n\nSo to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I need to calculate \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. Similarly for \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9, which would be \u03c8\u2020 P_z\u00b2 \u03c8.\n\nBut wait, since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So the diagonal elements of P_z\u00b2 would be (\u0127)^2, 0, (-\u0127)^2, which is \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo let's compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9 first.\n\nThe state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. Let me write it as a column vector:\n\n\u03c8 = [ -1/2 ]\n     [ 1/\u221a2 ]\n     [ -1/2 ]\n\nThe bra vector \u27e8\u03c8| would be the conjugate transpose. Since all the elements are real, it's just the transpose: [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ].\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c8| P_z |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] * P_z * |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, since P_z is diagonal, the matrix multiplication can be simplified. Let me compute each component.\n\nWhen I multiply P_z with |\u03c8\u27e9, each element is the product of the diagonal element and the corresponding component in \u03c8.\n\nSo P_z |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ \u0127*(-1/2), 0*(1/\u221a2), (-\u0127)*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ].\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8| P_z |\u03c8\u27e9 is the dot product of [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] and [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ].\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- (-1/2) * (-\u0127/2) = (1/2)(\u0127/2) = \u0127/4\n- (1/\u221a2) * 0 = 0\n- (-1/2) * (\u0127/2) = (-1/2)(\u0127/2) = -\u0127/4\n\nAdding them up: \u0127/4 + 0 - \u0127/4 = 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because when you multiply the first components: (-1/2) * (-\u0127/2) = (1/2)(\u0127/2) = \u0127/4. Then the third component: (-1/2) * (\u0127/2) = -\u0127/4. So yes, adding gives zero. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero.\n\nNow, compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z squared is diagonal with entries \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo P_z\u00b2 |\u03c8\u27e9 would be [ \u0127\u00b2*(-1/2), 0*(1/\u221a2), \u0127\u00b2*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ].\n\nNow, \u27e8\u03c8| P_z\u00b2 |\u03c8\u27e9 is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] \u00b7 [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ].\n\nCompute each term:\n\n- (-1/2) * (-\u0127\u00b2/2) = (1/2)(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/4\n- (1/\u221a2) * 0 = 0\n- (-1/2) * (-\u0127\u00b2/2) = (1/2)(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/4\n\nAdding them: \u0127\u00b2/4 + 0 + \u0127\u00b2/4 = \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 ). Since \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero, this becomes sqrt( (\u0127\u00b2/2) - 0 ) = sqrt( \u0127\u00b2/2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication for \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9.\n\nWait, no, because P_z squared has diagonal elements as (\u0127,0, -\u0127) squared, so each becomes \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2. So when you multiply P_z\u00b2 with |\u03c8\u27e9, each component is (\u0127\u00b2 * \u03c8\u2081, 0 * \u03c8\u2082, \u0127\u00b2 * \u03c8\u2083).\n\nSo \u03c8 is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ].\n\nSo P_z\u00b2 |\u03c8\u27e9 is [ (\u0127\u00b2)(-1/2), 0*(1/\u221a2), (\u0127\u00b2)(-1/2) ].\n\nThen, the inner product is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] \u00b7 [ (-\u0127\u00b2/2), 0, (-\u0127\u00b2/2) ].\n\nSo each term:\n\n- (-1/2)*(-\u0127\u00b2/2) = (1/2)(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/4\n- (1/\u221a2)*0 = 0\n- (-1/2)*(-\u0127\u00b2/2) = (1/2)(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/4\n\nTotal is \u0127\u00b2/4 + 0 + \u0127\u00b2/4 = \u0127\u00b2/2. So yes, correct.\n\nSo the uncertainty is sqrt( \u0127\u00b2/2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). Which is option B.\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nA) sqrt(2) \u0127\n\nB) \u0127 / sqrt(2)\n\nC) \u0127 / 2\n\nD) \u0127\n\nSo the correct answer is B.\n",

So the diagonal elements of P_z\u00b2 would be (\u0127)^2, 0, (-\u0127)^2, which is \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo let's compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9 first.\n\nThe state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. Let me write it as a column vector:\n\n\u03c8 = [ -1/2 ]\n     [ 1/\u221a2 ]\n     [ -1/2 ]\n\nThe bra vector \u27e8\u03c8| would be the conjugate transpose.

So when you multiply P_z\u00b2 with |\u03c8\u27e9, each component is (\u0127\u00b2 * \u03c8\u2081, 0 * \u03c8\u2082, \u0127\u00b2 * \u03c8\u2083).\n\nSo \u03c8 is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ].\n\nSo P_z\u00b2 |\u03c8\u27e9 is [ (\u0127\u00b2)(-1/2), 0*(1/\u221a2), (\u0127\u00b2)(-1/2) ].\n\nThen, the inner product is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] \u00b7 [ (-\u0127\u00b2/2), 0, (-\u0127\u00b2/2) ].\n\nSo each term:\n\n- (-1/2)*(-\u0127\u00b2/2) = (1/2)(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/4\n- (1/\u221a2)*0 = 0\n- (-1/2)*(-\u0127\u00b2/2) = (1/2)(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/4\n\nTotal is \u0127\u00b2/4 + 0 + \u0127\u00b2/4 = \u0127\u00b2/2. So yes, correct.\n\nSo the uncertainty is sqrt( \u0127\u00b2/2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). Which is option B.\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nA) sqrt(2) \u0127\n\nB) \u0127 / sqrt(2)\n\nC) \u0127 / 2\n\nD) \u0127\n\nSo the correct answer is B.\n\n\nTo calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ in the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle$\nThe state vector is given as:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe matrix form of $P_z$ is:\n\n\\[\nP_z = \\begin{bmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTo compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle$, we calculate $\\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem is about finding the uncertainty of P_z, which is denoted as \u0394P_z. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the standard deviation formula. So the formula should be something like the square root of the expectation of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation of P_z. Oh right, \u0394P_z = sqrt( <P_z\u00b2> - <P_z>\u00b2 ).\n\nBut wait, how do I find these expectation values? I think I need to find the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared for the given state. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Hmm, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So that should make things easier because the matrix P_z is diagonal in this basis.\n\nLet me write down the matrix P_z again. It's given as:\n\n[ [\u210f, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, -\u210f] ]\n\nSo in the eigenbasis of P_z, the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. That makes sense because when an operator is diagonal in its eigenbasis, the matrix elements are just the eigenvalues along the diagonal.\n\nThe state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. Wait, does that make sense? Let me check the normalization. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.\n\nCalculating that: (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, (1/sqrt(2))^2 is 1/2, and (-1/2)^2 is another 1/4. Adding them up: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. Yep, so it's normalized. Good.\n\nNow, to find <P_z>, I can calculate the expectation value by taking the inner product of |\u03c8> with P_z |\u03c8>. But since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.\n\nWait, another way: since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, each component of the state vector corresponds to an eigenvalue. So, the expectation value <P_z> would be the sum of (each component squared) multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.\n\nLet me break it down. The state is a combination of the three basis vectors |e1>, |e2>, |e3>, which are the eigenvectors of P_z. The eigenvalues for P_z are \u210f, 0, and -\u210f for each of these vectors respectively.\n\nSo, the state |\u03c8> can be written as:\n\n|\u03c8> = (-1/2) |e1> + (1/sqrt(2)) |e2> + (-1/2) |e3>\n\nSo, when we take the expectation value <P_z>, each component contributes (coefficient)^2 multiplied by their eigenvalue.\n\nCalculating <P_z>:\n\n= (-1/2)^2 * \u210f + (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 + (-1/2)^2 * (-\u210f)\n= (1/4)\u210f + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)(-\u210f)\n= (\u210f/4) - (\u210f/4) = 0.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So <P_z> is zero. So when we compute <P_z>\u00b2, it'll just be zero.\n\nNow, what about <P_z\u00b2>? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal, with each diagonal element squared. So the eigenvalues become (\u210f)^2, 0, and (-\u210f)^2. So the matrix P_z\u00b2 is:\n\n[ [\u210f\u00b2, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, \u210f\u00b2] ]\n\nSo, again, the expectation value <P_z\u00b2> is the sum of each component squared times the corresponding eigenvalue squared.\n\nSo,\n\n= (-1/2)^2 * \u210f\u00b2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 + (-1/2)^2 * \u210f\u00b2\n= (1/4)\u210f\u00b2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)\u210f\u00b2\n= (\u210f\u00b2/4 + \u210f\u00b2/4) = (\u210f\u00b2/2).\n\nSo <P_z\u00b2> is \u210f\u00b2/2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt( <P_z\u00b2> - <P_z>\u00b2 ) = sqrt( \u210f\u00b2/2 - 0 ) = sqrt( \u210f\u00b2 / 2 ) = \u210f / sqrt(2).\n\nLooking at the options, option B is \u210f/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the calculation?\n\nSo, the state components are a, b, c. So a=-1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2.\n\nFor <P_z>, it's a^2 * (\u210f) + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * (-\u210f). Wait, no! Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake here. The eigenvalues for P_z are \u210f, 0, -\u210f for each component. So the third component is c^2 times (-\u210f), not just \u210f. Oh wait, no, in the calculation I did earlier, I correctly accounted for the eigenvalues. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, I think I did it right. The first component is a^2 times \u210f, the third is c^2 times (-\u210f). So:\n\n( (-1/2)^2 * \u210f ) + ( (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 * (-\u210f) )\n\n= (1/4 \u210f) + 0 + (1/4)(-\u210f)\n= (1/4 -1/4 ) \u210f = 0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, for <P_z\u00b2>, each eigenvalue is squared, so \u210f\u00b2, 0, \u210f\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n( (-1/2)^2 * \u210f\u00b2 ) + ( (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 * \u210f\u00b2 )\n\n= (1/4)\u210f\u00b2 + 0 + (1/4)\u210f\u00b2 = (1/2)\u210f\u00b2.\n\nSo, yes, the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2)\u210f\u00b2 ) = \u210f / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem involves an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. The matrices for these operators are given, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px corresponding to the eigenvalue -\u0127. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty \u0394Pz of the operator Pz.\n\nHmm, right. So, the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. Mathematically, \u0394A = sqrt\u27e8A\u00b2\u27e9 \u2212 (\u27e8A\u27e9)\u00b2. So for \u0394Pz, I'll need \u27e8Pz\u27e9 and \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9.\n\nBut wait, since the state is given in the eigenbasis of Pz, maybe things will be easier. Because in that basis, the expectation values might be simpler to compute.\n\nWait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So, the state given is a vector in this basis. Let me check: the state is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T. So each component corresponds to an eigenstate of Pz.\n\nLet me think about the matrix of Pz. Oh, right, the matrix is diagonal because it's given in its own eigenbasis. The diagonal elements are \u0127, 0, -\u0127. So the eigenvalues are \u0127, 0, -\u0127 for the respective basis states.\n\nWait, so the state is a linear combination of these eigenstates. Let me see: the state is a column vector with components a, b, c. So |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|1\u27e9 + b|2\u27e9 + c|3\u27e9, where |1\u27e9, |2\u27e9, |3\u27e9 are the eigenstates of Pz with eigenvalues \u0127, 0, -\u0127 respectively.\n\nGiven the state vector is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T. So a = -1/2, b=1/\u221a2, c= -1/2.\n\nSo the expectation value of Pz is \u27e8\u03c8|Pz|\u03c8\u27e9. Since Pz is diagonal in this basis, this simplifies to a*(\u0127)*a + b*(0)*b + c*(-\u0127)*c.\n\nWait, let me compute that. So a is -1/2, so a*\u0127*a = (-1/2)^2 * \u0127 = (1/4)\u0127. Similarly, c is -1/2, so c*(-\u0127)*c = ( (-1/2) )^2 * (-\u0127) ) Wait, no, wait. Wait, the expectation value is a*(eigenvalue) * a + same for the others. So for each component:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8| Pz |\u03c8\u27e9 = |a|^2 * (eigenvalue of a's state) + |b|^2 * (eigenvalue of b's state) + |c|^2 * (eigenvalue of c's state).\n\nBut since the eigenvalues for |1\u27e9 is \u0127, |2\u27e9 is 0, and |3\u27e9 is -\u0127.\n\nSo let's compute |a|^2: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Multiply by eigenvalue \u0127: 1/4 * \u0127.\n\n|b|^2: (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2. Multiply by eigenvalue 0: 0.\n\n|c|^2: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Multiply by eigenvalue -\u0127: (1/4)(-\u0127) = -\u0127/4.\n\nSo summing these up: (1/4)\u0127 + 0 + (-1/4)\u0127 = 0. So \u27e8Pz\u27e9 is zero.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero. Now, what about \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9?\n\nPz squared is the same as Pz^2, which in this basis is diagonal as well, since Pz is diagonal. The eigenvalues for Pz squared will be (\u0127)^2, 0^2, (-\u0127)^2. So they are \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 is |a|^2*(\u0127^2) + |b|^2*(0) + |c|^2*(\u0127^2).\n\nSo |a|^2 is 1/4, so 1/4 * \u0127\u00b2. |c|^2 is 1/4 * \u0127\u00b2. Summing them gives (1/4 +1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo now, the uncertainty \u0394Pz is sqrt( \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 - (\u27e8Pz\u27e9)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt( \u0127\u00b2 / 2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Because the formula is sqrt(\u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8Pz\u27e9^2). Since \u27e8Pz\u27e9 is zero, it's just sqrt(\u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9).\n\nWhich is sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = (\u0127)/sqrt(2).\n\nLooking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2), which matches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the standard deviation another way, but I don't think so. Because the state is already in the eigenbasis of Pz, which should make the calculation straightforward.\n\nWait, another way: the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of Pz. So the probabilities are |a|^2, |b|^2, |c|^2. So the probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue.\n\nSo the possible outcomes are \u0127, 0, -\u0127. The probabilities are 1/4, 1/2, 1/4 respectively.\n\nSo the expectation value is (1/4)(\u0127) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-\u0127) = 0, as before.\n\nThe expectation value of Pz squared is (1/4)(\u0127^2) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(\u0127^2) = (1/4 + 1/4) \u0127^2 = 1/2 \u0127^2.\n\nSo the variance is 1/2 \u0127^2, so the standard deviation is sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the uncertainty \u0394Pz is \u0127/sqrt(2), which is option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.\n\nAlright, the problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, \u0394P_z, given that the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). \n\nHmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula \u0394A = sqrt(\u27e8A\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8A\u27e9\u00b2). So for P_z, I need to find \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 and \u27e8P_z\u27e9, then compute the square root of their difference.\n\nWait, but since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. So P_z doesn't have a definite value in this state, which is why there's an uncertainty. \n\nFirst, I should probably write down the matrix forms of the operators. Let me jot them down:\n\nP_x matrix:\nRow 1: 0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: \u0127/\u221a2, 0, \u0127/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0\n\nP_y matrix:\nRow 1: 0, -i\u0127/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: i\u0127/\u221a2, 0, -i\u0127/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, i\u0127/\u221a2, 0\n\nP_z matrix:\nRow 1: \u0127, 0, 0\nRow 2: 0, 0, 0\nRow 3: 0, 0, -\u0127\n\nThe basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the basis is |+z\u27e9, |0z\u27e9, |-z\u27e9, where |+z\u27e9 is (1,0,0), |0z\u27e9 is (0,1,0), and |-z\u27e9 is (0,0,1). \n\nThe state vector is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Let me denote this as |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nWait, I should check if this state is normalized. The sum of squares of the absolute values should be 1. Let's compute:\n\n|(-1/2)|\u00b2 = 1/4,\n|1/\u221a2|\u00b2 = 1/2,\n|(-1/2)|\u00b2 = 1/4.\n\nAdding them up: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. Okay, so it's normalized.\n\nNow, to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, which is the expectation value of P_z in state |\u03c8\u27e9. So I need to compute \u27e8\u03c8| P_z |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nBut wait, let me think. The operator P_z is a matrix, so I can compute this by multiplying the matrices.\n\nAlternatively, since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, maybe there's a simpler way. Because in this basis, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nWait, right! Because when the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is the weighted average of the eigenvalues. But wait, wait, the state |\u03c8\u27e9 is given in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.\n\nWait, no, wait. No, the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z. Because the problem says, \"the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z.\" So yes, |\u03c8\u27e9 is expressed in that basis.\n\nSo, the state |\u03c8\u27e9 is a vector in the P_z basis, which is the computational basis. So to find \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I can express |\u03c8\u27e9 as a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z and compute the expectation value.\n\nThe eigenvalues of P_z are \u0127, 0, and -\u0127, corresponding to the basis states |+z\u27e9, |0z\u27e9, and |-z\u27e9.\n\nSo, the state |\u03c8\u27e9 is:\n\n\u03c8 = (-1/2) |+z\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2) |0z\u27e9 + (-1/2) |-z\u27e9.\n\nSo the coefficients are a = -1/2 (for |+z\u27e9), b = 1/\u221a2 (for |0z\u27e9), and c = -1/2 (for |-z\u27e9).\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is a*(\u0127) + b*(0) + c*(-\u0127).\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (-1/2)(\u0127) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(-\u0127)\n= (-\u0127/2) + (\u0127/2)\n= 0.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So the average of P_z is zero.\n\nWait, let me compute it more carefully. Let me compute each term:\n\na is -1/2, so a * \u0127 = (-1/2) * \u0127 = -\u0127/2.\n\nc is -1/2, so c * (-\u0127) = (-1/2)*(-\u0127) = \u0127/2.\n\nSo adding them: (-\u0127/2) + (\u0127/2) = 0. And the middle term is zero. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is indeed zero.\n\nNow, I need \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the square is just the square of the eigenvalues. So \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is a\u00b2*(\u0127)^2 + b\u00b2*(0)^2 + c\u00b2*(-\u0127)^2.\n\nWhich simplifies to a\u00b2*(\u0127\u00b2) + c\u00b2*(\u0127\u00b2).\n\na is -1/2, so a squared is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nc is -1/2, so c squared is also 1/4.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2 + (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2 = (2/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo now, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2) = sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = (\u0127) * sqrt(1/2) ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2), and option C is \u0127/2. So the answer would be option B.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute this using matrix operations to cross-check.\n\nLet me compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9 by matrix multiplication. The state |\u03c8\u27e9 is a column vector [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c8| P_z |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2 , 1/\u221a2 , -1/2 ] * P_z * |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nBut P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries \u0127, 0, -\u0127. So when you multiply P_z with |\u03c8\u27e9, you get:\n\nP_z |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ \u0127*(-1/2), 0*(1/\u221a2), (-\u0127)*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ]^T.\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8| P_z |\u03c8\u27e9 is the dot product of [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] and [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ].\n\nSo:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127/2) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(\u0127/2)\n= (\u0127/4) + 0 - (\u0127/4)\n= 0. Which matches what I found earlier.\n\nNow, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is \u27e8\u03c8| P_z^2 |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nP_z squared is a diagonal matrix with entries (\u0127^2, 0, \u0127^2). So P_z^2 |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ \u0127\u00b2*(-1/2), 0*(1/\u221a2), \u0127\u00b2*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ]^T.\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8| P_z^2 |\u03c8\u27e9 is the dot product of [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] and [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ].\n\nSo:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127\u00b2/2) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(-\u0127\u00b2/2)\n= (\u0127\u00b2/4) + 0 + (\u0127\u00b2/4)\n= (2 \u0127\u00b2/4) = \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nSo again, same result. So \u0394P_z is sqrt( \u0127\u00b2/2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2), which is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.\n\nAlright, the problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, \u0394P_z, given that the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). \n\nHmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula \u0394A = sqrt(\u27e8A\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8A\u27e9\u00b2). So for P_z, I need to find \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 and \u27e8P_z\u27e9, then compute the square root of their difference.\n\nWait, but since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. So P_z doesn't have a definite value in this state, which is why there's an uncertainty. \n\nFirst, I should probably write down the matrix forms of the operators. Let me jot them down:\n\nP_x matrix:\nRow 1: 0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: \u0127/\u221a2, 0, \u0127/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0\n\nP_y matrix:\nRow 1: 0, -i\u0127/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: i\u0127/\u221a2, 0, -i\u0127/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, i\u0127/\u221a2, 0\n\nP_z matrix:\nRow 1: \u0127, 0, 0\nRow 2: 0, 0, 0\nRow 3: 0, 0, -\u0127\n\nThe basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the basis is |+z\u27e9, |0z\u27e9, |-z\u27e9, where |+z\u27e9 is (1,0,0), |0z\u27e9 is (0,1,0), and |-z\u27e9 is (0,0,1). \n\nThe state vector is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Let me denote this as |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nWait, I should check if this state is normalized. The sum of squares of the absolute values should be 1. Let's compute:\n\n|(-1/2)|\u00b2 = 1/4,\n|1/\u221a2|\u00b2 = 1/2,\n|(-1/2)|\u00b2 = 1/4.\n\nAdding them up: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. Okay, so it's normalized.\n\nNow, to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, which is the expectation value of P_z in state |\u03c8\u27e9. So I need to compute \u27e8\u03c8| P_z |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nBut wait, let me think. The operator P_z is a matrix, so I can compute this by multiplying the matrices.\n\nAlternatively, since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, maybe there's a simpler way. Because in this basis, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nWait, right! Because when the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is the weighted average of the eigenvalues. But wait, wait, the state |\u03c8\u27e9 is given in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.\n\nWait, no, wait. No, the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z. Because the problem says, \"the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z.\" So yes, |\u03c8\u27e9 is expressed in that basis.\n\nSo, the state |\u03c8\u27e9 is a vector in the P_z basis, which is the computational basis. So to find \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I can express |\u03c8\u27e9 as a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z and compute the expectation value.\n\nThe eigenvalues of P_z are \u0127, 0, and -\u0127, corresponding to the basis states |+z\u27e9, |0z\u27e9, and |-z\u27e9.\n\nSo, the state |\u03c8\u27e9 is:\n\n\u03c8 = (-1/2) |+z\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2) |0z\u27e9 + (-1/2) |-z\u27e9.\n\nSo the coefficients are a = -1/2 (for |+z\u27e9), b = 1/\u221a2 (for |0z\u27e9), and c = -1/2 (for |-z\u27e9).\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is a*(\u0127) + b*(0) + c*(-\u0127).\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (-1/2)(\u0127) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(-\u0127)\n= (-\u0127/2) + (\u0127/2)\n= 0.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So the average of P_z is zero.\n\nWait, let me compute it more carefully. Let me compute each term:\n\na is -1/2, so a * \u0127 = (-1/2) * \u0127 = -\u0127/2.\n\nc is -1/2, so c * (-\u0127) = (-1/2)*(-\u0127) = \u0127/2.\n\nSo adding them: (-\u0127/2) + (\u0127/2) = 0. And the middle term is zero. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is indeed zero.\n\nNow, I need \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the square is just the square of the eigenvalues. So \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is a\u00b2*(\u0127)^2 + b\u00b2*(0)^2 + c\u00b2*(-\u0127)^2.\n\nWhich simplifies to a\u00b2*(\u0127\u00b2) + c\u00b2*(\u0127\u00b2).\n\na is -1/2, so a squared is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nc is -1/2, so c squared is also 1/4.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2 + (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2 = (2/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo now, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2) = sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = (\u0127) * sqrt(1/2) ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2), and option C is \u0127/2. So the answer would be option B.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute this using matrix operations to cross-check.\n\nLet me compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9 by matrix multiplication. The state |\u03c8\u27e9 is a column vector [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c8| P_z |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2 , 1/\u221a2 , -1/2 ] * P_z * |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nBut P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries \u0127, 0, -\u0127. So when you multiply P_z with |\u03c8\u27e9, you get:\n\nP_z |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ \u0127*(-1/2), 0*(1/\u221a2), (-\u0127)*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ]^T.\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8| P_z |\u03c8\u27e9 is the dot product of [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] and [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ].\n\nSo:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127/2) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(\u0127/2)\n= (\u0127/4) + 0 - (\u0127/4)\n= 0. Which matches what I found earlier.\n\nNow, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is \u27e8\u03c8| P_z^2 |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nP_z squared is a diagonal matrix with entries (\u0127^2, 0, \u0127^2). So P_z^2 |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ \u0127\u00b2*(-1/2), 0*(1/\u221a2), \u0127\u00b2*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ]^T.\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8| P_z^2 |\u03c8\u27e9 is the dot product of [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] and [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ].\n\nSo:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127\u00b2/2) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(-\u0127\u00b2/2)\n= (\u0127\u00b2/4) + 0 + (\u0127\u00b2/4)\n= (2 \u0127\u00b2/4) = \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nSo again, same result. So \u0394P_z is sqrt( \u0127\u00b2/2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2), which is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle$\nThe state of the system is given as the column vector:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nSince the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\\hbar$, $0$, and $-\\hbar$, corresponding to the basis states $|+z\\rangle$, $|0z\\rangle$, and $|-z\\rangle$, respectively.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.\n\nThe question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, \u0394P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue, and I need to calculate the uncertainty. \n\nFirst, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation of the square minus the square of the expectation. So, \u0394P_z = sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2). \n\nBut wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, what does that mean for P_z? I think that if the system is in an eigenstate of an operator, then the expectation of another operator can be found using the state's components.\n\nThe given state is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me note that down. So \u03c8 is a vector with components [\u03c8\u2081, \u03c8\u2082, \u03c8\u2083] = [-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2].\n\nThe P_z matrix is given as:\n[[\u210f, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, -\u210f]]\n\nSo, to find \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I need to compute \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. Let's compute that.\n\nWait, but since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, each component in \u03c8 corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. Oh, that's right! Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, each component in \u03c8 represents the amplitude of that eigenstate. So the state \u03c8 can be expressed as a linear combination of the P_z eigenstates.\n\nSo, the components of \u03c8 are the coefficients for the eigenstates of P_z. Let me think: the first basis vector is the eigenstate with eigenvalue \u210f, the second with 0 (since the middle element is zero in P_z), and the third with eigenvalue -\u210f.\n\nWait, no. Looking at P_z again: the diagonal elements are \u210f, 0, -\u210f. So the basis vectors are |1\u27e9, |2\u27e9, |3\u27e9, where |1\u27e9 corresponds to eigenvalue \u210f, |3\u27e9 to -\u210f, and |2\u27e9 is 0. So the state \u03c8 is a combination of these.\n\nSo, the state \u03c8 is: \n\u03c8 = (-1/2)|1\u27e9 + (1/sqrt(2)) |2\u27e9 + (-1/2)|3\u27e9.\n\nWait, but when you have the state as a column vector, each component corresponds to the expansion in the eigenbasis of P_z. So the first component is the amplitude for |1\u27e9, the second for |2\u27e9, and the third for |3\u27e9.\n\nSo, to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, since |2\u27e9 has eigenvalue 0, the expectation value would be the sum of |amplitude|^2 times their eigenvalues.\n\nLet me compute that. The expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is the sum over the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.\n\nSo, the probabilities are |c\u2081|\u00b2, |c\u2082|\u00b2, |c\u2083|\u00b2.\n\nc\u2081 = -1/2, so |c\u2081|\u00b2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\nc\u2082 = 1/sqrt(2), so |c\u2082|\u00b2 = 1/2.\nc\u2083 = -1/2, so |c\u2083|\u00b2 = 1/4.\n\nThe eigenvalues for each state are \u210f (for |1\u27e9), 0 (for |2\u27e9), and -\u210f (for |3\u27e9).\n\nSo, \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (1/4)*\u210f + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-\u210f) = (1/4 - 1/4)\u210f = 0. So the expectation is zero.\n\nNow, what about \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9? Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the square is easy. The eigenvalues squared are (\u210f)^2, 0, (-\u210f)^2 = \u210f\u00b2. So \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the sum of |c\u2081|\u00b2*(\u210f\u00b2) + |c\u2082|\u00b2*(0) + |c\u2083|\u00b2*(\u210f\u00b2).\n\nThat's (1/4)*\u210f\u00b2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*\u210f\u00b2 = (1/4 + 1/4)\u210f\u00b2 = (1/2)\u210f\u00b2.\n\nSo now, the uncertainty is sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2) = sqrt( (1/2 \u210f\u00b2) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt(1/2 \u210f\u00b2) = (\u210f / sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is \u210f/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. I might have made a mistake with the components. Let me recompute the expectation values.\n\nThe state \u03c8 has components [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]. So |c\u2081|\u00b2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. |c\u2083|\u00b2 is same as c\u2081. So the expectation is 1/4 * \u210f + 1/4 * (-\u210f) = 0, correct.\n\n\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is 1/4*(\u210f\u00b2) + 1/4*(\u210f\u00b2) = (1/2) \u210f\u00b2. So yes, the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 \u210f\u00b2) = \u210f / sqrt(2), so option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.\n\nThe question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, \u0394P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue, and I need to calculate the uncertainty. \n\nFirst, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation of the square minus the square of the expectation. So, \u0394P_z = sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2). \n\nBut wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, what does that mean for P_z? I think that if the system is in an eigenstate of an operator, then the expectation of another operator can be found using the state's components.\n\nThe given state is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me note that down. So \u03c8 is a vector with components [\u03c8\u2081, \u03c8\u2082, \u03c8\u2083] = [-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2].\n\nThe P_z matrix is given as:\n[[\u210f, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, -\u210f]]\n\nSo, to find \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I need to compute \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. Let's compute that.\n\nWait, but since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, each component in \u03c8 corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. Oh, that's right! Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, each component in \u03c8 represents the amplitude of that eigenstate. So the state \u03c8 can be expressed as a linear combination of the P_z eigenstates.\n\nSo, the components of \u03c8 are the coefficients for the eigenstates of P_z. Let me think: the first basis vector is the eigenstate with eigenvalue \u210f, the second with 0 (since the middle element is zero in P_z), and the third with eigenvalue -\u210f.\n\nWait, no. Looking at P_z again: the diagonal elements are \u210f, 0, -\u210f. So the basis vectors are |1\u27e9, |2\u27e9, |3\u27e9, where |1\u27e9 corresponds to eigenvalue \u210f, |3\u27e9 to -\u210f, and |2\u27e9 is 0. So the state \u03c8 is a combination of these.\n\nSo, the state \u03c8 is: \n\u03c8 = (-1/2)|1\u27e9 + (1/sqrt(2)) |2\u27e9 + (-1/2)|3\u27e9.\n\nWait, but when you have the state as a column vector, each component corresponds to the expansion in the eigenbasis of P_z. So the first component is the amplitude for |1\u27e9, the second for |2\u27e9, and the third for |3\u27e9.\n\nSo, to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, since |2\u27e9 has eigenvalue 0, the expectation value would be the sum of |amplitude|^2 times their eigenvalues.\n\nLet me compute that. The expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is the sum over the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.\n\nSo, the probabilities are |c\u2081|\u00b2, |c\u2082|\u00b2, |c\u2083|\u00b2.\n\nc\u2081 = -1/2, so |c\u2081|\u00b2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\nc\u2082 = 1/sqrt(2), so |c\u2082|\u00b2 = 1/2.\nc\u2083 = -1/2, so |c\u2083|\u00b2 = 1/4.\n\nThe eigenvalues for each state are \u210f (for |1\u27e9), 0 (for |2\u27e9), and -\u210f (for |3\u27e9).\n\nSo, \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (1/4)*\u210f + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-\u210f) = (1/4 - 1/4)\u210f = 0. So the expectation is zero.\n\nNow, what about \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9? Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the square is easy. The eigenvalues squared are (\u210f)^2, 0, (-\u210f)^2 = \u210f\u00b2. So \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the sum of |c\u2081|\u00b2*(\u210f\u00b2) + |c\u2082|\u00b2*(0) + |c\u2083|\u00b2*(\u210f\u00b2).\n\nThat's (1/4)*\u210f\u00b2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*\u210f\u00b2 = (1/4 + 1/4)\u210f\u00b2 = (1/2)\u210f\u00b2.\n\nSo now, the uncertainty is sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2) = sqrt( (1/2 \u210f\u00b2) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt(1/2 \u210f\u00b2) = (\u210f / sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is \u210f/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. I might have made a mistake with the components. Let me recompute the expectation values.\n\nThe state \u03c8 has components [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]. So |c\u2081|\u00b2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. |c\u2083|\u00b2 is same as c\u2081. So the expectation is 1/4 * \u210f + 1/4 * (-\u210f) = 0, correct.\n\n\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is 1/4*(\u210f\u00b2) + 1/4*(\u210f\u00b2) = (1/2) \u210f\u00b2.
