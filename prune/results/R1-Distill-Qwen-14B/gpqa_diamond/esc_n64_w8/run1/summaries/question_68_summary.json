      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through step by step. The question is about a spin-1/2 particle, like an electron or something similar, in a magnetic field. The setup is that the magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. The particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. I remember that Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction, so mu = gamma Sz.\n\nSo, initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, which means the particle's spin will align with this field. The magnetic moment mu will have its maximum value in the z-direction. But then something happens: the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.\n\nHmm, okay. So the particle's magnetic moment is oscillating in the z-component. Why would that happen? Well, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian governing the system changes. The spin state will precess around the new field direction, I think. Precession usually leads to oscillations in the expectation values of the spin components.\n\nWait, let me think about the Hamiltonian. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -mu \u00b7 B. Since B is along +Z initially, H is proportional to Sz. When the field switches to +Y, H becomes proportional to Sy.\n\nWait, more accurately, the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B (S \u00b7 n), where n is the direction of the magnetic field. Initially, n is along z, so H = -\u03b3 B Sz. After the field is turned to y, H becomes -\u03b3 B Sy.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that both fields have the same magnitude. So the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = -\u03b3 B Sz, and the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -\u03b3 B Sy.\n\nSo the system starts in an eigenstate of H_initial. After the field is switched, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, so it will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe question asks about the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>, because mu = gamma Sz. So the oscillation frequency of <Sz> will determine the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, when you have a spin state that's not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, the expectation values oscillate with a frequency determined by the energy difference between the states involved.\n\nFor a spin-1/2 particle, the energy levels are \u00b1(\u03b3 B / 2), since the spin can be up or down. Wait, let me calculate that. The eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b1 \u0127/2 times some factor. Wait, actually, the spin matrices for Sx, Sy, Sz have eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 multiplied by their respective Pauli matrices.\n\nWait, the spin operator S has components Sx, Sy, Sz, each with eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So for Sy, the eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nSo the Hamiltonian after the switch is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. Wait, but wait, the actual expression would be H = -\u03bc \u00b7 B, and \u03bc is \u03b3 S. So H = -\u03b3 B Sy.\n\nWait, let me write that correctly. The magnetic moment \u03bc is given by \u03bc = \u03b3 S. So the energy is H = -\u03bc \u00b7 B. So when B is in the y-direction, H = -\u03b3 B Sy.\n\nThe eigenvalues of Sy are (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix, so Sy has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the eigenvalues of H would be -\u03b3 B * (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So the energies are E_up = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) * (1) and E_down = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) * (-1) ?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The spin operator Sy is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli y matrix. So Sy has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So when you have H = -\u03b3 B Sy, the energies are E = -\u03b3 B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So E_up = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and E_down = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, but the actual energy difference between the two states is E_down - E_up = [gamma B (\u0127/2)] - [ - gamma B (\u0127/2)] = gamma B \u0127.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure. The energy levels are E_+ = (-\u03b3 B)(+ \u0127/2) and E_- = (-\u03b3 B)(- \u0127/2) = + \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). So the difference is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2) - (- gamma B \u0127/2) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the energy difference is delta E = gamma B \u0127.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the time evolution of expectation values comes from transitions between these energy eigenstates. The frequency of oscillation is given by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So the oscillation frequency is (delta E) / \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWait, wait, but that can't be right. Because when the Hamiltonian is H = omega Sy, the precession frequency is omega, right? Let me think about it another way.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is determined by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. If the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz (since the field was along z), then after the field is turned to y, the state becomes a superposition of the eigenstates of Sy.\n\nThe expectation value of Sz will oscillate over time. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy difference between the two states involved, which is gamma B \u0127. So the angular frequency omega is (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because in the time evolution, the phase factors for the two states are e^(-i E_+ t/\u0127) and e^(-i E_- t/\u0127). The difference in phases is (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) t / \u0127 = gamma B t.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but the options don't have gamma B as the only choice. Let me look at the options.\n\nOptions:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nSo option B is gamma B. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because in spin systems, the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B, right?\n\nWait, but wait, let's think again. Let me model this more carefully.\n\nThe Hamiltonian after the switch is H = - gamma B Sy.\n\nThe time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is i\u0127 (d|\u03c8>/dt) = H |\u03c8>.\n\nThe initial state is |+z>, which is the eigenstate of Sz. So |+z> is (1, 0) in the Sz basis.\n\nWe can express |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H.\n\nThe eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |\u2212y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nThe eigenstates can be written as:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> \u2212 |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nBecause Sy is proportional to (Sx + i Sy)/2, but I might have gotten that wrong. Wait, let me get the exact expressions.\n\nThe eigenstates for Sy are:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> \u2212 i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nWait, perhaps I got the phase wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the time evolution.\n\nThe initial state is |+z>, which can be written as a combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nWait, no, because |+y> is (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2). So solving for |+z>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute this. Let me write the eigenstates |+y> and |\u2212y> in the z basis.\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> \u2212 i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo if we take |+z>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2) ?\n\nWait, substituting the expressions for |+y> and |\u2212y>:\n\n|+y> + |\u2212y> = [ (|+z> + i |\u2212z> ) + (|+z> \u2212 i |\u2212z> ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= [ 2 |+z> ] / sqrt(2)\nSo |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) * sqrt(2) / 2\n= (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the time evolution under H = - gamma B Sy.\n\nThe eigenvalues of H are E_+y = - gamma B (\u0127/2), and E_-y = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nBecause H |+y> = (- gamma B Sy) |+y> = (- gamma B)(\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nWait, Sy |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y> ?\n\nNo, wait, Sy is the operator. The eigenvalue equation is Sy |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nSo H = - gamma B Sy. So H |+y> = (- gamma B) (\u0127/2) |+y> = - (gamma B \u0127 / 2) |+y>.\n\nSimilarly, H |\u2212y> = (gamma B \u0127 / 2) |\u2212y>.\n\nSo the time evolution of each eigenstate is:\n\n|+y> \u2192 e^(-i E_+y t/\u0127) |+y> = e^(i (gamma B \u0127/2) t/\u0127 ) |+y> = e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y>\n|\u2212y> \u2192 e^(-i E_-y t/\u0127) |\u2212y> = e^( -i (gamma B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 ) |\u2212y> = e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } |\u2212y>\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + |\u2212y> e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2)\n\nWait no, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2), so when time evolves, each term picks up its own phase.\n\nSo |\u03c8(t)> = [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + |\u2212y> e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we need to find the expectation value of Sz, which is <Sz> = gamma <mu_z> / gamma? Wait, mu_z = gamma <Sz>, so <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.\n\nBut the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.\n\nSo first, find <Sz> as a function of time.\n\nThe Sz operator in the z basis is diagonal: it's (\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nBut let's express Sz in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <Sz> by taking the inner product.\n\nThe expectation value <Sz> is given by:\n\n<Sz> = <\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)>\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nBut perhaps a smarter way is to express Sz in terms of the |+y> and |\u2212y> states.\n\nWe know that in the z basis, Sz is diagonal, but in the y basis (spanned by |+y> and |\u2212y> ), Sz can be represented as a matrix. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value using the time-dependent state.\n\nWait, let me think. Since the state |\u03c8(t)> is a linear combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>, and Sz is an operator, perhaps we can compute <Sz> as follows.\n\nWait, |+y> and |\u2212y> are eigenstates of Sy, but not of Sz. So when you apply Sz to |+y>, you get a linear combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>.\n\nSo let's compute Sz |+y> and Sz |\u2212y> .\n\nWe know that Sz can be written in terms of the ladder operators. Alternatively, we can use the known relations between the spin states.\n\nWait, another approach: since |+y> and |\u2212y> are eigenstates of Sy, and Sy and Sx don't commute with Sz, perhaps we can express Sz in terms of the |+y> and |\u2212y> basis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <Sz> by expressing |\u03c8(t)> in the z basis and then computing the expectation value.\n\nWait, perhaps the state |\u03c8(t)> can be written as a vector in the z basis.\n\nWe have |+y> = (|+z> + i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> \u2212 i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo substituting into |\u03c8(t)>:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ (|+z> + i |\u2212z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2 } + (|+z> \u2212 i |\u2212z> ) e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2) * (1/sqrt(2))\n\nWait, because |+y> and |\u2212y> are each divided by sqrt(2), and the entire state is divided by sqrt(2), so the denominator becomes sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2.\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ (|+z> + i |\u2212z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2 } + (|+z> \u2212 i |\u2212z> ) e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / 2\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n= [ |+z> ( e^{i gamma B t/2 } + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ) + i |\u2212z> e^{i gamma B t/2 } - i |\u2212z> e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / 2\n\nFactor out the terms:\n\n= [ |+z> ( 2 cos(gamma B t/2) ) + i |\u2212z> ( e^{i gamma B t/2 } - e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ) ) ] / 2\n\nThe second term in the brackets is i |\u2212z> multiplied by ( e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} ), which is 2i sin(theta). So:\n\n= [ 2 |+z> cos(theta) + i |\u2212z> (2i sin(theta)) ) ] / 2\n\nWhere theta = gamma B t/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ 2 |+z> cos(theta) + (i)(2i) |\u2212z> sin(theta) ) ] / 2\n= [ 2 |+z> cos(theta) - 2 |\u2212z> sin(theta) ) ] / 2\n= |+z> cos(theta) - |\u2212z> sin(theta)\n\nSo the state |\u03c8(t)> is cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |\u2212z>, where theta = gamma B t/2.\n\nNow, compute the expectation value of Sz.\n\nSz is (\u0127/2) |+z><+z| - (\u0127/2) |\u2212z><\u2212z|.\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = <\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)>\n\nWhich is:\n\n[ cos(theta) < +z | - sin(theta) < -z | ] * Sz * [ cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |\u2212z> ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\n= cos^2(theta) < +z | Sz | +z > - cos(theta) sin(theta) < +z | Sz | \u2212z > \n- sin(theta) cos(theta) < \u2212z | Sz | +z > + sin^2(theta) < \u2212z | Sz | \u2212z >\n\nNow, < +z | Sz | +z > = \u0127/2\n< +z | Sz | \u2212z > = 0 (since Sz is diagonal in z basis)\nSimilarly, < \u2212z | Sz | +z > = 0\n< \u2212z | Sz | \u2212z > = - \u0127/2\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = cos^2(theta) (\u0127/2) + sin^2(theta) (-\u0127/2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta )\n\nBecause cos(2 theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).\n\nWait, but wait, that's for the expectation value of Sz in terms of theta, which is gamma B t /2.\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = (\u0127/2) cos( 2 * (gamma B t/2) )\n= (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the expectation value of Sz oscillates with angular frequency omega = gamma B.\n\nSince mu_z = gamma Sz, the expectation value of mu_z is:\n\n< mu_z > = gamma < Sz > = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but wait. Because mu = gamma S, so mu_z = gamma S_z. So,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma < S_z > = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos(gamma B t )\n\nBut the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, which is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think about the units. The angular frequency has units of 1/s. gamma has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1) because mu = gamma S, and S is in units of \u0127/2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for the Hamiltonian. Let me double-check.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B. mu = gamma S, so H = - gamma S \u00b7 B.\n\nBut in quantum mechanics, S is in units of \u0127/2. So when B is in Tesla, gamma is in rad s^-1 T^-1.\n\nBut perhaps I'm getting stuck on the units. Let's focus on the frequency.\n\nThe expectation value <mu_z> oscillates as cos(gamma B t), so the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but the problem says the average of the z-component starts oscillating. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Looking back at the options, option B is gamma*B.\n\nBut wait, another thought. The energy difference between the two states is E_+y - E_-y = [ gamma B (\u0127/2) ] - [ - gamma B (\u0127/2) ] = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is this energy difference divided by Planck's constant, so (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo yes, the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. The Larmor frequency is usually given by gamma B, right? So when you have a spin in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo that suggests the answer is B) gamma*B.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed <Sz>, I found it oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), which suggests the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, another approach. The Hamiltonian after the switch is H = - gamma B Sy.\n\nThe energy levels are E = \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2 )\n\nThe energy difference is E_+ - E_- = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe transition frequency is delta E / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let's think about the time dependence. Because when you have a state that's a superposition of two energy eigenstates, the time dependence of the expectation value of an observable involves terms oscillating at the difference frequency of the two energies.\n\nIn this case, the two energy levels are E_+y and E_-y. So the difference is E_-y - E_+y = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the frequency is (E_-y - E_+y) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo yes, the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through step by step. The question is about a spin-1/2 particle, like an electron or something similar, in a magnetic field. The setup is that the magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. The particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. I remember that Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction, so mu = gamma Sz.\n\nSo, initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, which means the particle's spin will align with this field. The magnetic moment mu will have its maximum value in the z-direction. But then something happens: the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.\n\nHmm, okay. So the particle's magnetic moment is oscillating in the z-component. Why would that happen? Well, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian governing the system changes. The spin state will precess around the new field direction, I think. Precession usually leads to oscillations in the expectation values of the spin components.\n\nWait, let me think about the Hamiltonian. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -mu \u00b7 B. Since B is along +Z initially, H is proportional to Sz. When the field switches to +Y, H becomes proportional to Sy.\n\nWait, more accurately, the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B (S \u00b7 n), where n is the direction of the magnetic field. Initially, n is along z, so H = -\u03b3 B Sz. After the field is turned to y, H becomes -\u03b3 B Sy.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that both fields have the same magnitude. So the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = -\u03b3 B Sz, and the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -\u03b3 B Sy.\n\nSo the system starts in an eigenstate of H_initial. After the field is switched, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, so it will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe question asks about the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>, because mu = gamma Sz. So the oscillation frequency of <Sz> will determine the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, when you have a spin state that's not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, the expectation values oscillate with a frequency determined by the energy difference between the states involved.\n\nFor a spin-1/2 particle, the energy levels are \u00b1(\u03b3 B / 2), since the spin can be up or down. Wait, let me calculate that. The eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b1 \u0127/2 times some factor. Wait, actually, the spin matrices for Sx, Sy, Sz have eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 multiplied by their respective Pauli matrices.\n\nWait, the spin operator S has components Sx, Sy, Sz, each with eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So for Sy, the eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nSo the Hamiltonian after the switch is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. Wait, but wait, the actual expression would be H = -\u03bc \u00b7 B, and \u03bc is \u03b3 S. So H = -\u03b3 B Sy.\n\nWait, let me write that correctly. The magnetic moment \u03bc is given by \u03bc = \u03b3 S. So the energy is H = -\u03bc \u00b7 B. So when B is in the y-direction, H = -\u03b3 B Sy.\n\nThe eigenvalues of Sy are (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix, so Sy has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the eigenvalues of H would be -\u03b3 B * (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So the energies are E_up = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) * (1) and E_down = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) * (-1) ?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The spin operator Sy is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli y matrix. So Sy has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So when you have H = -\u03b3 B Sy, the energies are E = -\u03b3 B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So E_up = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and E_down = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, but the actual energy difference between the two states is E_down - E_up = [gamma B (\u0127/2)] - [ - gamma B (\u0127/2)] = gamma B \u0127.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure. The energy levels are E_+ = (-\u03b3 B)(+ \u0127/2) and E_- = (-\u03b3 B)(- \u0127/2) = + \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). So the difference is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2) - (- gamma B \u0127/2) ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the energy difference is delta E = gamma B \u0127.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the time evolution of expectation values comes from transitions between these energy eigenstates. The frequency of oscillation is given by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So the oscillation frequency is (delta E) / \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWait, wait, but that can't be right. Because when the Hamiltonian is H = omega Sy, the precession frequency is omega, right? Let me think about it another way.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is determined by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. If the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz (since the field was along z), then after the field is turned to y, the state becomes a superposition of the eigenstates of Sy.\n\nThe expectation value of Sz will oscillate over time. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy difference between the two states involved, which is gamma B \u0127. So the angular frequency omega is (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because in the time evolution, the phase factors for the two states are e^(-i E_+ t/\u0127) and e^(-i E_- t/\u0127). The difference in phases is (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) t / \u0127 = gamma B t.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but the options don't have gamma B as the only choice. Let me look at the options.\n\nOptions:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nSo option B is gamma B. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because in spin systems, the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B, right?\n\nWait, but wait, let's think again. Let me model this more carefully.\n\nThe Hamiltonian after the switch is H = - gamma B Sy.\n\nThe time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is i\u0127 (d|\u03c8>/dt) = H |\u03c8>.\n\nThe initial state is |+z>, which is the eigenstate of Sz. So |+z> is (1, 0) in the Sz basis.\n\nWe can express |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H.\n\nThe eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |\u2212y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |\u2212z>.\n\nThe eigenstates can be written as:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> \u2212 |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nBecause Sy is proportional to (Sx + i Sy)/2, but I might have gotten that wrong. Wait, let me get the exact expressions.\n\nThe eigenstates for Sy are:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> \u2212 i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nWait, perhaps I got the phase wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the time evolution.\n\nThe initial state is |+z>, which can be written as a combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nWait, no, because |+y> is (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2). So solving for |+z>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute this. Let me write the eigenstates |+y> and |\u2212y> in the z basis.\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> \u2212 i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo if we take |+z>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2) ?\n\nWait, substituting the expressions for |+y> and |\u2212y>:\n\n|+y> + |\u2212y> = [ (|+z> + i |\u2212z> ) + (|+z> \u2212 i |\u2212z> ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= [ 2 |+z> ] / sqrt(2)\nSo |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) * sqrt(2) / 2\n= (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the time evolution under H = - gamma B Sy.\n\nThe eigenvalues of H are E_+y = - gamma B (\u0127/2), and E_-y = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nBecause H |+y> = (- gamma B Sy) |+y> = (- gamma B)(\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nWait, Sy |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y> ?\n\nNo, wait, Sy is the operator. The eigenvalue equation is Sy |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>.\n\nSo H = - gamma B Sy. So H |+y> = (- gamma B) (\u0127/2) |+y> = - (gamma B \u0127 / 2) |+y>.\n\nSimilarly, H |\u2212y> = (gamma B \u0127 / 2) |\u2212y>.\n\nSo the time evolution of each eigenstate is:\n\n|+y> \u2192 e^(-i E_+y t/\u0127) |+y> = e^(i (gamma B \u0127/2) t/\u0127 ) |+y> = e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y>\n|\u2212y> \u2192 e^(-i E_-y t/\u0127) |\u2212y> = e^( -i (gamma B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 ) |\u2212y> = e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } |\u2212y>\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + |\u2212y> e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2)\n\nWait no, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |\u2212y> ) / sqrt(2), so when time evolves, each term picks up its own phase.\n\nSo |\u03c8(t)> = [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + |\u2212y> e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we need to find the expectation value of Sz, which is <Sz> = gamma <mu_z> / gamma? Wait, mu_z = gamma <Sz>, so <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.\n\nBut the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.\n\nSo first, find <Sz> as a function of time.\n\nThe Sz operator in the z basis is diagonal: it's (\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nBut let's express Sz in terms of |+y> and |\u2212y>.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <Sz> by taking the inner product.\n\nThe expectation value <Sz> is given by:\n\n<Sz> = <\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)>\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nBut perhaps a smarter way is to express Sz in terms of the |+y> and |\u2212y> states.\n\nWe know that in the z basis, Sz is diagonal, but in the y basis (spanned by |+y> and |\u2212y> ), Sz can be represented as a matrix. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value using the time-dependent state.\n\nWait, let me think. Since the state |\u03c8(t)> is a linear combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>, and Sz is an operator, perhaps we can compute <Sz> as follows.\n\nWait, |+y> and |\u2212y> are eigenstates of Sy, but not of Sz. So when you apply Sz to |+y>, you get a linear combination of |+y> and |\u2212y>.\n\nSo let's compute Sz |+y> and Sz |\u2212y> .\n\nWe know that Sz can be written in terms of the ladder operators. Alternatively, we can use the known relations between the spin states.\n\nWait, another approach: since |+y> and |\u2212y> are eigenstates of Sy, and Sy and Sx don't commute with Sz, perhaps we can express Sz in terms of the |+y> and |\u2212y> basis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <Sz> by expressing |\u03c8(t)> in the z basis and then computing the expectation value.\n\nWait, perhaps the state |\u03c8(t)> can be written as a vector in the z basis.\n\nWe have |+y> = (|+z> + i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n|\u2212y> = (|+z> \u2212 i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo substituting into |\u03c8(t)>:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ (|+z> + i |\u2212z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2 } + (|+z> \u2212 i |\u2212z> ) e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2) * (1/sqrt(2))\n\nWait, because |+y> and |\u2212y> are each divided by sqrt(2), and the entire state is divided by sqrt(2), so the denominator becomes sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2.\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = [ (|+z> + i |\u2212z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2 } + (|+z> \u2212 i |\u2212z> ) e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / 2\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n= [ |+z> ( e^{i gamma B t/2 } + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ) + i |\u2212z> e^{i gamma B t/2 } - i |\u2212z> e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ] / 2\n\nFactor out the terms:\n\n= [ |+z> ( 2 cos(gamma B t/2) ) + i |\u2212z> ( e^{i gamma B t/2 } - e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ) ) ] / 2\n\nThe second term in the brackets is i |\u2212z> multiplied by ( e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} ), which is 2i sin(theta). So:\n\n= [ 2 |+z> cos(theta) + i |\u2212z> (2i sin(theta)) ) ] / 2\n\nWhere theta = gamma B t/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ 2 |+z> cos(theta) + (i)(2i) |\u2212z> sin(theta) ) ] / 2\n= [ 2 |+z> cos(theta) - 2 |\u2212z> sin(theta) ) ] / 2\n= |+z> cos(theta) - |\u2212z> sin(theta)\n\nSo the state |\u03c8(t)> is cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |\u2212z>, where theta = gamma B t/2.\n\nNow, compute the expectation value of Sz.\n\nSz is (\u0127/2) |+z><+z| - (\u0127/2) |\u2212z><\u2212z|.\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = <\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)>\n\nWhich is:\n\n[ cos(theta) < +z | - sin(theta) < -z | ] * Sz * [ cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |\u2212z> ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\n= cos^2(theta) < +z | Sz | +z > - cos(theta) sin(theta) < +z | Sz | \u2212z > \n- sin(theta) cos(theta) < \u2212z | Sz | +z > + sin^2(theta) < \u2212z | Sz | \u2212z >\n\nNow, < +z | Sz | +z > = \u0127/2\n< +z | Sz | \u2212z > = 0 (since Sz is diagonal in z basis)\nSimilarly, < \u2212z | Sz | +z > = 0\n< \u2212z | Sz | \u2212z > = - \u0127/2\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = cos^2(theta) (\u0127/2) + sin^2(theta) (-\u0127/2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta )\n\nBecause cos(2 theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).\n\nWait, but wait, that's for the expectation value of Sz in terms of theta, which is gamma B t /2.\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = (\u0127/2) cos( 2 * (gamma B t/2) )\n= (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the expectation value of Sz oscillates with angular frequency omega = gamma B.\n\nSince mu_z = gamma Sz, the expectation value of mu_z is:\n\n< mu_z > = gamma < Sz > = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but wait. Because mu = gamma S, so mu_z = gamma S_z. So,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma < S_z > = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos(gamma B t )\n\nBut the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, which is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think about the units. The angular frequency has units of 1/s. gamma has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1) because mu = gamma S, and S is in units of \u0127/2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for the Hamiltonian. Let me double-check.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B. mu = gamma S, so H = - gamma S \u00b7 B.\n\nBut in quantum mechanics, S is in units of \u0127/2. So when B is in Tesla, gamma is in rad s^-1 T^-1.\n\nBut perhaps I'm getting stuck on the units. Let's focus on the frequency.\n\nThe expectation value <mu_z> oscillates as cos(gamma B t), so the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but the problem says the average of the z-component starts oscillating. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Looking back at the options, option B is gamma*B.\n\nBut wait, another thought. The energy difference between the two states is E_+y - E_-y = [ gamma B (\u0127/2) ] - [ - gamma B (\u0127/2) ] = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is this energy difference divided by Planck's constant, so (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo yes, the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. The Larmor frequency is usually given by gamma B, right? So when you have a spin in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo that suggests the answer is B) gamma*B.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed <Sz>, I found it oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), which suggests the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, another approach. The Hamiltonian after the switch is H = - gamma B Sy.\n\nThe energy levels are E = \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2 )\n\nThe energy difference is E_+ - E_- = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe transition frequency is delta E / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let's think about the time dependence. Because when you have a state that's a superposition of two energy eigenstates, the time dependence of the expectation value of an observable involves terms oscillating at the difference frequency of the two energies.\n\nIn this case, the two energy levels are E_+y and E_-y. So the difference is E_-y - E_+y = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo the frequency is (E_-y - E_+y) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo yes, the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. When the field is suddenly switched to point along the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian changes from $H_{\\text{initial}} = -\\gamma B S_z$ to $H_{\\text{final}} = -\\gamma B S_y$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, $|+z\\rangle$, corresponding to $\\mu_z = \\gamma \\hbar/2$.\n\n2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the field switches to $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\\pm \\hbar/2$. These states are superpositions of $|+z\\rangle$ and $|-z\\rangle$:\n   \\[\n   |+y\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+z\\rangle + i|-z\\rangle), \\quad |-y\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+z\\rangle - i|-z\\rangle).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle).\n   \\]\n   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{-i\\gamma B t/2} |+y\\rangle + e^{i\\gamma B t/2} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: The expectation value of $S_z$ is computed using:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle.\n   \\]\n   Substituting the time-evolved state and using the fact that $S_z$ is diagonal in the $|+z\\rangle, |-z\\rangle$ basis, the result simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n\n5. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ (and hence $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$) occurs with angular frequency $\\omega = \\gamma B$. This matches the energy difference between the eigenstates of $H$, divided by $\\hbar$:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta E = \\gamma B \\hbar \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\omega = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\hbar} = \\gamma B.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$, corresponding to **option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem about spin 1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, I remember that spin is a form of angular momentum, right? The particle has a magnetic moment mu which is equal to gamma times Sz. Oh wait, Sz is the spin component along the z-axis. So mu = gamma * Sz.\n\nThe setup is that the magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. So the magnetic moment would align with this field because that's the lowest energy state. But then the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. \n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after the field is switched. So initially, when the field is along Z, the spin is aligned, and the expectation value of Sz would be at its maximum. But when the field switches to Y, the situation changes.\n\nWait, I think when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the energy is given by the dot product: H = -mu \u00b7 B. So initially, H was proportional to Sz. After the switch, H becomes proportional to Sy because the field is along Y.\n\nWait, the initial state of the spin is along +Z. Let me think about the spin states. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of Sz are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2 times \u0127, but I think we might be working in units where \u0127 is 1 or something. \n\nWhen the magnetic field is in the Z direction, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sz. So the energy levels are E_plus = -gamma B (1/2) and E_minus = gamma B (1/2), assuming Sz is (1/2 and -1/2). So the state is an eigenstate of Sz, so the expectation value of Sz is either +gamma/2 or -gamma/2, depending on the state.\n\nBut when the field is turned off and turned on in Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H' = -gamma B Sy. Because mu is gamma S, so the dot product with B in Y direction is mu Sy. So H' is proportional to Sy.\n\nNow, the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. But H' is proportional to Sy, so the eigenstates are different. The state will no longer be an eigenstate of H', so it will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z = gamma <Sz>. So we need to find the expectation value of Sz as a function of time and determine its oscillation frequency.\n\nThe general approach is to express the initial state in terms of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian H', then find how the state evolves over time, and then compute the expectation value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use time-dependent perturbation theory, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Wait, the change is sudden, so perhaps it's a time evolution under a new Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, the system was in an eigenstate of Sz before the field change. After the field is changed, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. So the state is |+z> initially, which is not an eigenstate of H'.\n\nSo the state will evolve under the new Hamiltonian. Let me think about the time evolution. The time evolution of a state is given by the time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i H' t / \u0127). Assuming \u0127 is 1 for simplicity.\n\nThe initial state is |+z> = |up_z> = (|+x> + |\u2212x>)/sqrt(2), or maybe expressed in terms of eigenstates of Sy.\n\nWait, the eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2. So the initial state |+z> can be expressed as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nLet me write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>. The eigenstates of Sy are:\n\n|+y> = (|+x> + i|\u2212x>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+x> - i|\u2212x>)/sqrt(2)\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>. Because the initial state is |+z>, and we need to write it as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nI recall that the |+z> state can be expressed as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Wait, is that correct? Let me think: the state |+y> is (|+z> + i|\u2212z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - i|\u2212z>)/sqrt(2). So solving for |+z>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, |\u2212z> = (|+y> \u2212 |-y>)/sqrt(2). So yes, the initial state is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the time evolution under H' = -gamma B Sy. The energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y> with energies E_+ = (-gamma B)(1/2) and E_- = (-gamma B)(-1/2) = gamma B (1/2).\n\nWait, H' = -gamma B Sy. Since Sy has eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2. So E_+ = -gamma B (1/2), and E_- = -gamma B (-1/2) = gamma B (1/2).\n\nSo the initial state |psi(0)> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). So the state at time t will be:\n\n|psi(t)> = (exp(-i E_+ t) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t) |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo substituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ = - (gamma B/2) \u2192 exp(-i E_+ t) = exp( i (gamma B/2) t )\n\nE_- = gamma B/2 \u2192 exp(-i E_- t) = exp( -i (gamma B/2) t )\n\nSo |psi(t)> = [ exp(i (gamma B/2) t ) |+y> + exp(-i (gamma B/2) t ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, we need to find the expectation value of Sz at time t. Let me compute <Sz> = <psi(t) | Sz | psi(t)>.\n\nBut Sz is the spin operator along z. Let me find the matrix elements. Let me note that Sz has eigenstates |+z> and |-z> with eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express Sz in the basis of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nLet me recall that the spin matrices in different directions are related. The Pauli matrices can help here. Let me think of Sx, Sy, Sz as the spin components.\n\nThe eigenstates |+y> and |-y> can be written in terms of |+z> and |-z>. Alternatively, I can express Sz in the |+y>, |-y> basis.\n\nThe matrix representation of Sz in the |+y>, |-y> basis would be as follows. Since the eigenstates of Sz are |+z> and |-z>, and the |+y> and |-y> are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>, the matrix will be:\n\nIn the basis |+y>, |-y>, Sz is represented as:\n\n[ [0, 1],\n  [1, 0] ] multiplied by (\u0127/2), but perhaps I should be more precise.\n\nWait, the actual matrix elements. Let me think. The state |+y> is (|+z> + i|\u2212z>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, |-y> is (|+z> - i|\u2212z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe operator Sz acts on these states. Let me compute Sz |+y>.\n\nSz |+y> = Sz (|+z> + i|\u2212z>)/sqrt(2) = ( (1/2) |+z> - (1/2) i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, because Sz |+z> = (\u0127/2)|+z>, but perhaps for simplicity, I'll take \u0127=1. So Sz |+z> = (1/2)|+z>, and Sz |\u2212z> = (-1/2)|\u2212z>.\n\nSo,\n\nSz |+y> = ( (1/2) |+z> + i (-1/2) |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) \n= [ |+z> - i |\u2212z> ] / (2 sqrt(2)).\n\nBut |+y> and |-y> are the basis vectors. So perhaps it's easier to write the matrix elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express Sz in terms of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are:\n\nsigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]\nsigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]\nsigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nSo Sz = (\u0127/2) sigma_z. So in the |+y>, |-y> basis, the sigma_z matrix would have entries [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ] but expressed in the |+y>, |-y> basis.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sigma_z is in the |+z>, |-z> basis. So to find Sz in the |+y>, |-y> basis, I need to perform a change of basis.\n\nThe transformation from |+z>, |-z> to |+y>, |-y> is given by the rotation about the x-axis by 90 degrees. Because rotating from z to y would involve a rotation about x by 90 degrees, I think. So the rotation matrix would be R_x(pi/2), which is:\n\n[ [1, 0, 0],\n  [0, cos(pi/4), -sin(pi/4)],\n  [0, sin(pi/4), cos(pi/4)] ]\n\nWait, no, the rotation matrices for spin-1/2 are 2x2. So the rotation about x by angle theta is:\n\n[ [1, 0],\n  [0, e^{i theta} ] ] ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of unitary transformations. The rotation from |+z> to |+y> can be achieved by a rotation around the x-axis by 90 degrees (pi/2 radians). The rotation operator for spin-1/2 is U = exp(-i theta Sx / \u0127 ). For theta = pi/2, U = exp(-i (pi/2) Sx ). \n\nBut Sx is (\u0127/2) sigma_x. So U = exp( -i (pi/2) (sigma_x / 2) ) * \u0127? Wait, maybe I should just compute the matrix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the matrix elements of Sz in the |+y> basis.\n\nLet me think: The state |+y> is (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, |-y> is (|+z> - i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo, to find Sz in the |+y> and |-y> basis, I can compute the matrix elements:\n\n< +y | Sz | +y > = (1/2) < +y | +z > + (-1/2) < +y | -z >.\n\nWait, no, because Sz |+z> = (1/2)|+z>, and Sz |\u2212z> = (-1/2)|\u2212z>.\n\nSo < +y | Sz | +y > = (1/2) * [ < +y | +z > + i < +y | -z > ].\n\nWait, no, let me compute:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\nSo < +y | = ( < +z | - i < \u2212z | ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo < +y | Sz | +y > = [ ( < +z | - i < \u2212z | ) / sqrt(2) ] * Sz * ( |+z> + i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) )\n\n= [ ( < +z | Sz | +z> ) + i < +z | Sz | \u2212z> ) - i < \u2212z | Sz | +z> ) - i^2 < \u2212z | Sz | \u2212z> ) ] / 2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n< +z | Sz | +z> = (1/2)\n< +z | Sz | \u2212z> = 0\n< \u2212z | Sz | +z> = 0\n< \u2212z | Sz | \u2212z> = (-1/2)\n\nSo,\n\n= [ (1/2) + i*(0) - i*(0) - i^2*(-1/2) ] / 2\ni squared is -1, so:\n\n= [ (1/2) + 0 +0 - (-1)(-1/2) ) ] /2\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, the term from < +z | Sz | \u2212z> is multiplied by i. But that inner product is zero. Similarly, the term < \u2212z | Sz | +z> is zero. So the expression simplifies to:\n\n[ (1/2) + 0 + 0 - (i^2)(-1/2) ) ] / 2\ni^2 is -1, so:\n\n= [ (1/2) - (-1)(-1/2) ) ] / 2\n= [ 1/2 - (1/2) ) ] / 2\n= 0/2 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, the diagonal elements are zero for both |+y> and |-y> states. So the Sz matrix in the |+y>, |-y> basis is:\n\n[ [0, a], [a*, 0] ]\n\nBecause the off-diagonal elements would be non-zero.\n\nLet me compute the off-diagonal elements. Let's find < +y | Sz | -y >.\n\n< +y | Sz | -y > = [ ( < +z | - i < -z | ) / sqrt(2) ) ] * Sz * ( |+z> - i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) )\n\n= [ ( < +z | Sz | +z> ) - i < +z | Sz | -z> ) - i < -z | Sz | +z> ) + i^2 < -z | Sz | -z> ) ] / 2\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n< +z | Sz | +z> = 1/2\n< +z | Sz | -z> = 0\n< -z | Sz | +z> = 0\n< -z | Sz | -z> = -1/2\n\nSo,\n\n= [ (1/2) - i*(0) - i*(0) + (-1)(-1/2) ) ] / 2\n= [ 1/2 + (1/2) ] / 2\n= (1) / 2 = 1/2.\n\nWait, but that's in the |+y>, |-y> basis. So the matrix elements for Sz would be:\n\n[ [0, 1/2], [1/2, 0] ].\n\nBut wait, the actual operator is (gamma/2) Sz, perhaps, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix is:\n\n[ [0, 1], [1, 0] ] multiplied by some factor.\n\nWait, the spin operator Sz has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. But in the |+y>, |-y> basis, the matrix is [[0, 1/2], [1/2, 0]].\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrix sigma_z is diagonal, so in the |+y> basis, it would not be diagonal. So the matrix representation would have off-diagonal terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the matrix elements another way. Let me think: the state |+y> is (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2). So when Sz acts on |+y>, it becomes:\n\nSz |+y> = (1/2)|+z> + (-1/2)(i |\u2212z> ) ) / sqrt(2)\n= [ |+z> - i |\u2212z> ] / (2 sqrt(2))\n\nBut this is equal to a combination of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nWait, because:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo, Sz |+y> = (|+z> - i |\u2212z> )/(2 sqrt(2)) )\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n= ( |+y> + |-y> ) / (4 sqrt(2)) ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I can express |+z> - i |\u2212z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nLet me write |+z> - i |\u2212z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) ) - i (|+y> - |-y> )/(sqrt(2) i ) ) ?\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the coefficients. Let me write |+z> - i |\u2212z> = a |+y> + b |-y>.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for |+y> and |-y>:\n\n|+z> - i |\u2212z> = a [ (|+z> + i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] + b [ (|+z> - i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n\nGrouping terms:\n\n= [ a (|+z> ) + b |+z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] + [ a (i |\u2212z> ) - b (i |\u2212z> ) ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n\n= [ (a + b)|+z> + i (a - b)|\u2212z> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSet this equal to |+z> - i |\u2212z>:\n\nSo,\n\n(a + b)/sqrt(2) = 1\ni (a - b)/sqrt(2) = -i\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(2):\n\na + b = sqrt(2)\ni (a - b) = -i sqrt(2) \u2192 (a - b) = -sqrt(2)\n\nNow, solve the equations:\n\na + b = sqrt(2)\na - b = -sqrt(2)\n\nAdding both equations:\n\n2a = 0 \u2192 a = 0.\n\nThen, substituting a =0 into a + b = sqrt(2) \u2192 b = sqrt(2).\n\nSo,\n\n|+z> - i |\u2212z> = 0 * |+y> + sqrt(2) |-y> \n\nWait, that can't be right because substituting a=0 and b=sqrt(2):\n\n|+z> - i |\u2212z> = sqrt(2) * (|+z> - i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) )\n\nWhich is just |+z> - i |\u2212z> = (|+z> - i |\u2212z> )\n\nSo yes, that works. So Sz |+y> = (|+z> - i |\u2212z> )/(2 sqrt(2)) ) = [ (|+z> - i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] * (1/(2))\n\nBut since |+z> -i |\u2212z> = sqrt(2) |-y>, as we found, then:\n\n= (sqrt(2) |-y> ) / (2 sqrt(2)) ) = |-y> / 2.\n\nSo,\n\nSz |+y> = (1/2) |-y>.\n\nSimilarly, what about Sz |-y>?\n\nCompute Sz |-y> = (1/2)|\u2212z> * [ expression ]\n\nWait, let me compute using the same method:\n\nSz |-y> = (1/2) |\u2212z> [from |\u2212y> ] ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute it the same way as before.\n\n|-y> = (|+z> - i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo,\n\nSz |-y> = (1/2)|+z> + (-1/2)(-i)|\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= [ (1/2)|+z> + (i/2)|\u2212z> ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= [ |+z> + i |\u2212z> ) ]/( 2 sqrt(2) )\n\nWhich is |+y> / 2.\n\nSo,\n\nSz |-y> = (1/2)|+y>.\n\nSo putting it all together, the matrix of Sz in the |+y>, |-y> basis is:\n\n< +y | Sz | +y > = 0\n< +y | Sz | -y > = 1/2\n< -y | Sz | +y > = 1/2\n< -y | Sz | -y > = 0\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\n[ [ 0, 1/2 ],\n  [ 1/2, 0 ] ]\n\nSo, the operator Sz in the |+y> basis is (1/2) times the Pauli X matrix, because the X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]].\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of Sz at time t is given by <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>.\n\nWe have |psi(t)> = [ exp(i (gamma B/2) t ) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B/2) t ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSo, let's compute <Sz> = <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>.\n\nSubstituting Sz's matrix in the |+y>, |-y> basis, which is:\n\nSz = (1/2) [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n\nSo,\n\n<psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)> = (1/2) * [ (a*) (b) + (b*) (a) ) ]\n\nWhere a and b are the coefficients of |+y> and |-y> in |psi(t)>.\n\nIn |psi(t)>, the coefficients are:\n\na = exp( i (gamma B/2) t ) / sqrt(2)\nb = exp( -i (gamma B/2) t ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo,\n\na = e^{i w t} / sqrt(2)\nb = e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2}, where w = gamma B/2.\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz > = (1/2) [ (a^* b) + (b^* a) ]\n\nCompute a^* = e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2), b^* = e^{i w t} / sqrt(2}\n\nSo,\n\na^* b = (e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2)) * (e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2)) ) = e^{-2 i w t} / 2\n\nb^* a = (e^{i w t} / sqrt(2)) * (e^{i w t} / sqrt(2)) ) = e^{2 i w t} / 2\n\nSo,\n\n( a^* b + b^* a ) = [ e^{-2 i w t} + e^{2 i w t} ] / 2 = cos(2 w t )\n\nTherefore,\n\n< Sz > = (1/2) * [ cos(2 w t) ] * (1/2) ?\n\nWait, wait, no:\n\nWait, the [ a^* b + b^* a ] is [e^{-2iw t} + e^{2iw t}]/2, which is cos(2 w t).\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz > = (1/2) * cos(2 w t )\n\nBecause <Sz> = (1/2) * [ (a^* b + b^* a) ]\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz > = (1/2) * cos( 2 w t )\n\nBut wait, since w = gamma B /2,\n\n2 w t = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz > = (1/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says mu = gamma Sz. So the z-component of the magnetic moment is mu_z = gamma <Sz>.\n\nSo,\n\nmu_z = gamma * <Sz> = gamma * (1/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. The average is (gamma/2) cos( gamma B t ), so the oscillation has amplitude gamma/2 and frequency gamma B.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma*B.\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of <Sz>.\n\nWait, let me recheck the matrix elements.\n\nWait, in the |+y> basis, the matrix of Sz is (1/2) [[0,1],[1,0]].\n\nSo when I compute <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>, I can write this as:\n\n(1/2) [ (a^* b) + (b^* a) ]\n\nBecause the matrix elements are:\n\n< +y | Sz | +y > = 0\n< +y | Sz | -y > = 1/2\n< -y | Sz | +y > = 1/2\n< -y | Sz | -y > = 0\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz > = (a^* a * 0 ) + (a^* b * 1/2) + (b^* a * 1/2) + (b^* b * 0 )\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2)(a^* b + b^* a )\n\nWhich is (1/2)( 2 Re( a^* b ) )\n\n= Re( a^* b )\n\nSo,\n\na = e^{i w t} / sqrt(2)\nb = e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2}\n\na^* = e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2)\n\nSo,\n\na^* b = (e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2)) ) (e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2)) ) = e^{-2i w t} / 2\n\nSo,\n\nRe( a^* b ) = Re( e^{-2i w t} / 2 ) = (1/2) cos(2 w t )\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz > = (1/2) * (1/2) cos(2 w t )\n\nWait, no, wait: Re( a^* b ) is [ e^{-2i w t} + e^{2i w t} ] / 4?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute Re( a^* b ) correctly.\n\na^* b = (e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2)) ) * (e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2)) ) = e^{-2 i w t} / 2\n\nSo,\n\nRe( a^* b ) = (1/2) Re( e^{-2i w t} ) = (1/2) cos(2 w t )\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz > = Re( a^* b ) = (1/2) cos(2 w t )\n\nThen, since mu_z = gamma <Sz>, this gives:\n\nmu_z = gamma * (1/2) cos( 2 w t )\n\nBut w = gamma B / 2, so 2 w = gamma B.\n\nSo,\n\nmu_z = (gamma/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but the average oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma * B.\n\nSo the answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem about spin 1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, I remember that spin is a form of angular momentum, right? The particle has a magnetic moment mu which is equal to gamma times Sz. Oh wait, Sz is the spin component along the z-axis. So mu = gamma * Sz.\n\nThe setup is that the magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. So the magnetic moment would align with this field because that's the lowest energy state. But then the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. \n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after the field is switched. So initially, when the field is along Z, the spin is aligned, and the expectation value of Sz would be at its maximum. But when the field switches to Y, the situation changes.\n\nWait, I think when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the energy is given by the dot product: H = -mu \u00b7 B. So initially, H was proportional to Sz. After the switch, H becomes proportional to Sy because the field is along Y.\n\nWait, the initial state of the spin is along +Z. Let me think about the spin states. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of Sz are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2 times \u0127, but I think we might be working in units where \u0127 is 1 or something. \n\nWhen the magnetic field is in the Z direction, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sz. So the energy levels are E_plus = -gamma B (1/2) and E_minus = gamma B (1/2), assuming Sz is (1/2 and -1/2). So the state is an eigenstate of Sz, so the expectation value of Sz is either +gamma/2 or -gamma/2, depending on the state.\n\nBut when the field is turned off and turned on in Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H' = -gamma B Sy. Because mu is gamma S, so the dot product with B in Y direction is mu Sy. So H' is proportional to Sy.\n\nNow, the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. But H' is proportional to Sy, so the eigenstates are different. The state will no longer be an eigenstate of H', so it will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe question is about the average of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z = gamma <Sz>. So we need to find the expectation value of Sz as a function of time and determine its oscillation frequency.\n\nThe general approach is to express the initial state in terms of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian H', then find how the state evolves over time, and then compute the expectation value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use time-dependent perturbation theory, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Wait, the change is sudden, so perhaps it's a time evolution under a new Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, the system was in an eigenstate of Sz before the field change. After the field is changed, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. So the state is |+z> initially, which is not an eigenstate of H'.\n\nSo the state will evolve under the new Hamiltonian. Let me think about the time evolution. The time evolution of a state is given by the time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i H' t / \u0127). Assuming \u0127 is 1 for simplicity.\n\nThe initial state is |+z> = |up_z> = (|+x> + |\u2212x>)/sqrt(2), or maybe expressed in terms of eigenstates of Sy.\n\nWait, the eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2. So the initial state |+z> can be expressed as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nLet me write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>. The eigenstates of Sy are:\n\n|+y> = (|+x> + i|\u2212x>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+x> - i|\u2212x>)/sqrt(2)\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>. Because the initial state is |+z>, and we need to write it as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nI recall that the |+z> state can be expressed as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Wait, is that correct? Let me think: the state |+y> is (|+z> + i|\u2212z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - i|\u2212z>)/sqrt(2). So solving for |+z>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, |\u2212z> = (|+y> \u2212 |-y>)/sqrt(2). So yes, the initial state is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the time evolution under H' = -gamma B Sy. The energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y> with energies E_+ = (-gamma B)(1/2) and E_- = (-gamma B)(-1/2) = gamma B (1/2).\n\nWait, H' = -gamma B Sy. Since Sy has eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2. So E_+ = -gamma B (1/2), and E_- = -gamma B (-1/2) = gamma B (1/2).\n\nSo the initial state |psi(0)> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). So the state at time t will be:\n\n|psi(t)> = (exp(-i E_+ t) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t) |-y> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSo substituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ = - (gamma B/2) \u2192 exp(-i E_+ t) = exp( i (gamma B/2) t )\n\nE_- = gamma B/2 \u2192 exp(-i E_- t) = exp( -i (gamma B/2) t )\n\nSo |psi(t)> = [ exp(i (gamma B/2) t ) |+y> + exp(-i (gamma B/2) t ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, we need to find the expectation value of Sz at time t. Let me compute <Sz> = <psi(t) | Sz | psi(t)>.\n\nBut Sz is the spin operator along z. Let me find the matrix elements. Let me note that Sz has eigenstates |+z> and |-z> with eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express Sz in the basis of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nLet me recall that the spin matrices in different directions are related. The Pauli matrices can help here. Let me think of Sx, Sy, Sz as the spin components.\n\nThe eigenstates |+y> and |-y> can be written in terms of |+z> and |-z>. Alternatively, I can express Sz in the |+y>, |-y> basis.\n\nThe matrix representation of Sz in the |+y>, |-y> basis would be as follows. Since the eigenstates of Sz are |+z> and |-z>, and the |+y> and |-y> are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>, the matrix will be:\n\nIn the basis |+y>, |-y>, Sz is represented as:\n\n[ [0, 1],\n  [1, 0] ] multiplied by (\u0127/2), but perhaps I should be more precise.\n\nWait, the actual matrix elements. Let me think. The state |+y> is (|+z> + i|\u2212z>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, |-y> is (|+z> - i|\u2212z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe operator Sz acts on these states. Let me compute Sz |+y>.\n\nSz |+y> = Sz (|+z> + i|\u2212z>)/sqrt(2) = ( (1/2) |+z> - (1/2) i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, because Sz |+z> = (\u0127/2)|+z>, but perhaps for simplicity, I'll take \u0127=1. So Sz |+z> = (1/2)|+z>, and Sz |\u2212z> = (-1/2)|\u2212z>.\n\nSo,\n\nSz |+y> = ( (1/2) |+z> + i (-1/2) |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) \n= [ |+z> - i |\u2212z> ] / (2 sqrt(2)).\n\nBut |+y> and |-y> are the basis vectors. So perhaps it's easier to write the matrix elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express Sz in terms of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are:\n\nsigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]\nsigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]\nsigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nSo Sz = (\u0127/2) sigma_z. So in the |+y>, |-y> basis, the sigma_z matrix would have entries [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ] but expressed in the |+y>, |-y> basis.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sigma_z is in the |+z>, |-z> basis. So to find Sz in the |+y>, |-y> basis, I need to perform a change of basis.\n\nThe transformation from |+z>, |-z> to |+y>, |-y> is given by the rotation about the x-axis by 90 degrees. Because rotating from z to y would involve a rotation about x by 90 degrees, I think. So the rotation matrix would be R_x(pi/2), which is:\n\n[ [1, 0, 0],\n  [0, cos(pi/4), -sin(pi/4)],\n  [0, sin(pi/4), cos(pi/4)] ]\n\nWait, no, the rotation matrices for spin-1/2 are 2x2. So the rotation about x by angle theta is:\n\n[ [1, 0],\n  [0, e^{i theta} ] ] ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of unitary transformations. The rotation from |+z> to |+y> can be achieved by a rotation around the x-axis by 90 degrees (pi/2 radians). The rotation operator for spin-1/2 is U = exp(-i theta Sx / \u0127 ). For theta = pi/2, U = exp(-i (pi/2) Sx ). \n\nBut Sx is (\u0127/2) sigma_x. So U = exp( -i (pi/2) (sigma_x / 2) ) * \u0127? Wait, maybe I should just compute the matrix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the matrix elements of Sz in the |+y> basis.\n\nLet me think: The state |+y> is (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, |-y> is (|+z> - i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo, to find Sz in the |+y> and |-y> basis, I can compute the matrix elements:\n\n< +y | Sz | +y > = (1/2) < +y | +z > + (-1/2) < +y | -z >.\n\nWait, no, because Sz |+z> = (1/2)|+z>, and Sz |\u2212z> = (-1/2)|\u2212z>.\n\nSo < +y | Sz | +y > = (1/2) * [ < +y | +z > + i < +y | -z > ].\n\nWait, no, let me compute:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\nSo < +y | = ( < +z | - i < \u2212z | ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo < +y | Sz | +y > = [ ( < +z | - i < \u2212z | ) / sqrt(2) ] * Sz * ( |+z> + i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) )\n\n= [ ( < +z | Sz | +z> ) + i < +z | Sz | \u2212z> ) - i < \u2212z | Sz | +z> ) - i^2 < \u2212z | Sz | \u2212z> ) ] / 2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n< +z | Sz | +z> = (1/2)\n< +z | Sz | \u2212z> = 0\n< \u2212z | Sz | +z> = 0\n< \u2212z | Sz | \u2212z> = (-1/2)\n\nSo,\n\n= [ (1/2) + i*(0) - i*(0) - i^2*(-1/2) ] / 2\ni squared is -1, so:\n\n= [ (1/2) + 0 +0 - (-1)(-1/2) ) ] /2\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, the term from < +z | Sz | \u2212z> is multiplied by i. But that inner product is zero. Similarly, the term < \u2212z | Sz | +z> is zero. So the expression simplifies to:\n\n[ (1/2) + 0 + 0 - (i^2)(-1/2) ) ] / 2\ni^2 is -1, so:\n\n= [ (1/2) - (-1)(-1/2) ) ] / 2\n= [ 1/2 - (1/2) ) ] / 2\n= 0/2 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, the diagonal elements are zero for both |+y> and |-y> states. So the Sz matrix in the |+y>, |-y> basis is:\n\n[ [0, a], [a*, 0] ]\n\nBecause the off-diagonal elements would be non-zero.\n\nLet me compute the off-diagonal elements. Let's find < +y | Sz | -y >.\n\n< +y | Sz | -y > = [ ( < +z | - i < -z | ) / sqrt(2) ) ] * Sz * ( |+z> - i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) )\n\n= [ ( < +z | Sz | +z> ) - i < +z | Sz | -z> ) - i < -z | Sz | +z> ) + i^2 < -z | Sz | -z> ) ] / 2\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n< +z | Sz | +z> = 1/2\n< +z | Sz | -z> = 0\n< -z | Sz | +z> = 0\n< -z | Sz | -z> = -1/2\n\nSo,\n\n= [ (1/2) - i*(0) - i*(0) + (-1)(-1/2) ) ] / 2\n= [ 1/2 + (1/2) ] / 2\n= (1) / 2 = 1/2.\n\nWait, but that's in the |+y>, |-y> basis. So the matrix elements for Sz would be:\n\n[ [0, 1/2], [1/2, 0] ].\n\nBut wait, the actual operator is (gamma/2) Sz, perhaps, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix is:\n\n[ [0, 1], [1, 0] ] multiplied by some factor.\n\nWait, the spin operator Sz has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. But in the |+y>, |-y> basis, the matrix is [[0, 1/2], [1/2, 0]].\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrix sigma_z is diagonal, so in the |+y> basis, it would not be diagonal. So the matrix representation would have off-diagonal terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the matrix elements another way. Let me think: the state |+y> is (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2). So when Sz acts on |+y>, it becomes:\n\nSz |+y> = (1/2)|+z> + (-1/2)(i |\u2212z> ) ) / sqrt(2)\n= [ |+z> - i |\u2212z> ] / (2 sqrt(2))\n\nBut this is equal to a combination of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nWait, because:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - i |\u2212z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo, Sz |+y> = (|+z> - i |\u2212z> )/(2 sqrt(2)) )\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n= ( |+y> + |-y> ) / (4 sqrt(2)) ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I can express |+z> - i |\u2212z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nLet me write |+z> - i |\u2212z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) ) - i (|+y> - |-y> )/(sqrt(2) i ) ) ?\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the coefficients. Let me write |+z> - i |\u2212z> = a |+y> + b |-y>.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for |+y> and |-y>:\n\n|+z> - i |\u2212z> = a [ (|+z> + i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] + b [ (|+z> - i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n\nGrouping terms:\n\n= [ a (|+z> ) + b |+z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] + [ a (i |\u2212z> ) - b (i |\u2212z> ) ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n\n= [ (a + b)|+z> + i (a - b)|\u2212z> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSet this equal to |+z> - i |\u2212z>:\n\nSo,\n\n(a + b)/sqrt(2) = 1\ni (a - b)/sqrt(2) = -i\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(2):\n\na + b = sqrt(2)\ni (a - b) = -i sqrt(2) \u2192 (a - b) = -sqrt(2)\n\nNow, solve the equations:\n\na + b = sqrt(2)\na - b = -sqrt(2)\n\nAdding both equations:\n\n2a = 0 \u2192 a = 0.\n\nThen, substituting a =0 into a + b = sqrt(2) \u2192 b = sqrt(2).\n\nSo,\n\n|+z> - i |\u2212z> = 0 * |+y> + sqrt(2) |-y> \n\nWait, that can't be right because substituting a=0 and b=sqrt(2):\n\n|+z> - i |\u2212z> = sqrt(2) * (|+z> - i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) )\n\nWhich is just |+z> - i |\u2212z> = (|+z> - i |\u2212z> )\n\nSo yes, that works. So Sz |+y> = (|+z> - i |\u2212z> )/(2 sqrt(2)) ) = [ (|+z> - i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] * (1/(2))\n\nBut since |+z> -i |\u2212z> = sqrt(2) |-y>, as we found, then:\n\n= (sqrt(2) |-y> ) / (2 sqrt(2)) ) = |-y> / 2.\n\nSo,\n\nSz |+y> = (1/2) |-y>.\n\nSimilarly, what about Sz |-y>?\n\nCompute Sz |-y> = (1/2)|\u2212z> * [ expression ]\n\nWait, let me compute using the same method:\n\nSz |-y> = (1/2) |\u2212z> [from |\u2212y> ] ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute it the same way as before.\n\n|-y> = (|+z> - i |\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo,\n\nSz |-y> = (1/2)|+z> + (-1/2)(-i)|\u2212z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= [ (1/2)|+z> + (i/2)|\u2212z> ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= [ |+z> + i |\u2212z> ) ]/( 2 sqrt(2) )\n\nWhich is |+y> / 2.\n\nSo,\n\nSz |-y> = (1/2)|+y>.\n\nSo putting it all together, the matrix of Sz in the |+y>, |-y> basis is:\n\n< +y | Sz | +y > = 0\n< +y | Sz | -y > = 1/2\n< -y | Sz | +y > = 1/2\n< -y | Sz | -y > = 0\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\n[ [ 0, 1/2 ],\n  [ 1/2, 0 ] ]\n\nSo, the operator Sz in the |+y> basis is (1/2) times the Pauli X matrix, because the X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]].\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of Sz at time t is given by <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>.\n\nWe have |psi(t)> = [ exp(i (gamma B/2) t ) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B/2) t ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSo, let's compute <Sz> = <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>.\n\nSubstituting Sz's matrix in the |+y>, |-y> basis, which is:\n\nSz = (1/2) [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n\nSo,\n\n<psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)> = (1/2) * [ (a*) (b) + (b*) (a) ) ]\n\nWhere a and b are the coefficients of |+y> and |-y> in |psi(t)>.\n\nIn |psi(t)>, the coefficients are:\n\na = exp( i (gamma B/2) t ) / sqrt(2)\nb = exp( -i (gamma B/2) t ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo,\n\na = e^{i w t} / sqrt(2)\nb = e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2}, where w = gamma B/2.\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz > = (1/2) [ (a^* b) + (b^* a) ]\n\nCompute a^* = e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2), b^* = e^{i w t} / sqrt(2}\n\nSo,\n\na^* b = (e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2)) * (e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2)) ) = e^{-2 i w t} / 2\n\nb^* a = (e^{i w t} / sqrt(2)) * (e^{i w t} / sqrt(2)) ) = e^{2 i w t} / 2\n\nSo,\n\n( a^* b + b^* a ) = [ e^{-2 i w t} + e^{2 i w t} ] / 2 = cos(2 w t )\n\nTherefore,\n\n< Sz > = (1/2) * [ cos(2 w t) ] * (1/2) ?\n\nWait, wait, no:\n\nWait, the [ a^* b + b^* a ] is [e^{-2iw t} + e^{2iw t}]/2, which is cos(2 w t).\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz > = (1/2) * cos(2 w t )\n\nBecause <Sz> = (1/2) * [ (a^* b + b^* a) ]\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz > = (1/2) * cos( 2 w t )\n\nBut wait, since w = gamma B /2,\n\n2 w t = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz > = (1/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says mu = gamma Sz. So the z-component of the magnetic moment is mu_z = gamma <Sz>.\n\nSo,\n\nmu_z = gamma * <Sz> = gamma * (1/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. The average is (gamma/2) cos( gamma B t ), so the oscillation has amplitude gamma/2 and frequency gamma B.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma*B.\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of <Sz>.\n\nWait, let me recheck the matrix elements.\n\nWait, in the |+y> basis, the matrix of Sz is (1/2) [[0,1],[1,0]].\n\nSo when I compute <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>, I can write this as:\n\n(1/2) [ (a^* b) + (b^* a) ]\n\nBecause the matrix elements are:\n\n< +y | Sz | +y > = 0\n< +y | Sz | -y > = 1/2\n< -y | Sz | +y > = 1/2\n< -y | Sz | -y > = 0\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz > = (a^* a * 0 ) + (a^* b * 1/2) + (b^* a * 1/2) + (b^* b * 0 )\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2)(a^* b + b^* a )\n\nWhich is (1/2)( 2 Re( a^* b ) )\n\n= Re( a^* b )\n\nSo,\n\na = e^{i w t} / sqrt(2)\nb = e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2}\n\na^* = e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2)\n\nSo,\n\na^* b = (e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2)) ) (e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2)) ) = e^{-2i w t} / 2\n\nSo,\n\nRe( a^* b ) = Re( e^{-2i w t} / 2 ) = (1/2) cos(2 w t )\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz > = (1/2) * (1/2) cos(2 w t )\n\nWait, no, wait: Re( a^* b ) is [ e^{-2i w t} + e^{2i w t} ] / 4?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute Re( a^* b ) correctly.\n\na^* b = (e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2)) ) * (e^{-i w t} / sqrt(2)) ) = e^{-2 i w t} / 2\n\nSo,\n\nRe( a^* b ) = (1/2) Re( e^{-2i w t} ) = (1/2) cos(2 w t )\n\nSo,\n\n< Sz > = Re( a^* b ) = (1/2) cos(2 w t )\n\nThen, since mu_z = gamma <Sz>, this gives:\n\nmu_z = gamma * (1/2) cos( 2 w t )\n\nBut w = gamma B / 2, so 2 w = gamma B.\n\nSo,\n\nmu_z = (gamma/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but the average oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma * B.\n\nSo the answer should be option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. When the field is suddenly switched to point along the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian changes from $H_z = -\\gamma B S_z$ to $H_y = -\\gamma B S_y$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle$.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial State and Basis Transformation**:  \n   The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, $|+z\\rangle$. After the field is switched to $+y$, the Hamiltonian involves $S_y$, whose eigenstates are $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$. The initial state $|+z\\rangle$ can be expressed in terms of $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$ as:  \n   \\[\n   |+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle).\n   \\]\n\n2. **Time Evolution Under $H_y$**:  \n   The Hamiltonian $H_y = -\\gamma B S_y$ has eigenvalues $E_+ = -\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}$ and $E_- = \\frac{\\gamma B}{2}$ for $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, respectively. The time-evolved state is:  \n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{-iE_+t} |+y\\rangle + e^{-iE_-t} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n   Substituting $E_+$ and $E_-$, this becomes:  \n   \\[\n   |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{i\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t} |+y\\rangle + e^{-i\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t} |-y\\rangle \\right).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  \n   The $z$-component of the spin operator, $S_z$, has the matrix representation in the $|+y\\rangle, |-y\\rangle$ basis:  \n   \\[\n   S_z = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n   \\]\n   Using $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$, the expectation value $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ is computed as:  \n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{Re} \\left( a^* b + b^* a \\right),\n   \\]\n   where $a = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} e^{i\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t}$ and $b = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} e^{-i\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}t}$. Substituting these, we find:  \n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  \n   The magnetic moment $\\mu_z = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle$ oscillates as:  \n   \\[\n   \\mu_z = \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of $t$ inside the cosine, which is $\\gamma B$.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe oscillation frequency of the $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the setup: There's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same strength B. They're asking about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The spin is aligned with the field, right? So the magnetic moment mu is in the same direction as the field. But when the field is suddenly changed to Y, the situation changes. Since the magnetic field direction changes, the particle's spin precesses around the new field direction.\n\nI remember that in such cases, the spin will precess, and this precession leads to oscillations in the expectation values of the spin components. But how does this affect the z-component?\n\nLet me think about the Hamiltonian. The magnetic moment mu interacts with the magnetic field B through the Zeeman term. The Hamiltonian should be H = -mu \u00b7 B. Since mu is gamma Sz, and the field is along Y after the change, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B (Sz) times some direction? Wait, no, wait. Wait, mu is gamma S, right? So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector (Sx, Sy, Sz). So the interaction energy is H = - mu \u00b7 B. Since B is along Y after the switch, H = - gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, no. Wait, mu is a vector, and B is a vector, so their dot product is mu \u00b7 B. So H = - mu \u00b7 B = -gamma (Sx B_x + Sy B_y + Sz B_z). But in the new scenario, B is along +Y, so B_x = 0, B_z = 0, B_y = B. So H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * Sz. Oh wait, is mu = gamma S? Or is mu = gamma * S_z? Wait, the question says mu = gamma * S_z. So wait, that's different. So mu is only in the z-direction? So the magnetic moment is along z, but the field is now along y. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me recheck. The problem states mu = gamma * S_z. Oh, so mu is just the z-component of the spin times gamma. So the magnetic moment vector is only in the z-direction? Or is mu a vector equal to gamma times the spin vector S? Hmm, that's a critical point.\n\nWait, the question says mu is equal to gamma multiplied by Sz. So mu is a vector? Or is mu just a scalar value? Hmm, I think in physics, the magnetic moment is a vector. Oh, but wait, the notation is mu = gamma * S_z. So perhaps mu is a vector pointing in the same direction as S_z, with magnitude gamma times S_z. Wait, but for spin-1/2 particles, S_z can be \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the Hamiltonian. The energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So if mu is gamma Sz, then H = -gamma Sz B \u00b7 something. Wait, if the magnetic field is along Y, then B is (0, B, 0). So H = - gamma Sz * B_y.\n\nWait, but wait, no: mu is a vector, and B is a vector. So the dot product is mu \u00b7 B. So if mu is gamma S, then H = -gamma (S \u00b7 B). But wait, the question says mu = gamma S_z, which would imply that mu is a vector in the z-direction. So mu = gamma S_z \u1e91. So the dot product mu \u00b7 B is gamma S_z B_y, because B is along y.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If mu is a vector, and mu = gamma S_z \u1e91, then when B is along y, the dot product is mu \u00b7 B = (gamma S_z \u1e91) \u00b7 (B \u0233) ) = gamma S_z * B * (\u1e91 \u00b7 \u0233) = 0. Because the z and y unit vectors are perpendicular. So H would be zero?\n\nThat can't be right because the question says that the average of the z-component starts oscillating. So maybe I made a mistake in interpreting mu.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mu is the entire spin vector multiplied by gamma. So mu = gamma S, where S is the vector (Sx, Sy, Sz). Then, the Hamiltonian would be H = - mu \u00b7 B = - gamma (S \u00b7 B). If B is along y, then H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because then the spin would precess around the y-axis. And that would cause the components of spin in x and z to oscillate, perhaps.\n\nWait, but the question says mu = gamma S_z. So I think that's different. Hmm. Maybe I should go back to the question.\n\nQuestion says: mu = gamma S_z. So mu is a vector pointing along z, with magnitude gamma times S_z. So the magnetic moment is along z, regardless of the spin direction. So when B is along y, the interaction is mu \u00b7 B, which is zero because mu is along z and B along y. So H would be zero? Then the spin wouldn't precess, and the average z-component wouldn't oscillate. But the question says it does oscillate. So maybe I'm misunderstanding mu.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mu is a vector that is aligned with the spin direction. So mu = gamma S, the entire vector. Then, when B is along y, the interaction would be H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but the question says mu = gamma S_z, which is just the z-component. So that would mean mu is along z, regardless of the spin's orientation. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that mu is the z-component of the magnetic moment. But then, the magnetic field is along y, so the energy would be H = - mu B cos(theta), where theta is the angle between mu and B. But mu is along z, and B is along y, so the angle is 90 degrees. So cos(theta) is zero, and H is zero. But that can't be right because the oscillation is observed.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe particle has magnetic moment mu = gamma * S_z, aligned with a magnetic field pointing in +Z. So when the field is along +Z, the magnetic moment is aligned, so the energy is minimized. Then, the field is turned off and another turned on along +Y. Both have same magnitude B.\n\nWait, but if mu is along +Z, and the field is turned off, then there's no magnetic field, so the particle's spin should be in a state of zero magnetic field. But then, when the field is turned on along Y, the magnetic moment mu is still along Z, so the interaction would be mu \u00b7 B = mu B cos(theta), theta is 90 degrees. So no interaction. So H is zero. So why would the z-component oscillate?\n\nBut the question says the average z-component oscillates. So I must be misunderstanding something about mu.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mu is the total magnetic moment, which is gamma times the spin vector S. So mu = gamma S. Then, when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the spin will precess about the Y-axis. But how does that affect the expectation value of Sz?\n\nI remember that when a spin is subject to a Hamiltonian proportional to Sy, the spin precesses around the Y-axis. The expectation value of Sx and Sz will oscillate with time. So the average of S_z would vary sinusoidally, right?\n\nSo let's model this. The time evolution of the spin state under H = w Sy, where w is some frequency. The energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies +w/2 and -w/2.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the time evolution operator. The time evolution is given by U = exp(-i H t / \u0127). But since we're dealing with spin-1/2, perhaps using the Pauli matrices would help.\n\nThe spin operators can be written in terms of Pauli matrices: Sx = \u0127/2 \u03c3x, Sy = \u0127/2 \u03c3y, Sz = \u0127/2 \u03c3z.\n\nSo H = -gamma B Sy = -gamma B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. So H = - (gamma B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ). Substituting H:\n\nU(t) = exp( i (gamma B / 2) \u03c3y t )\n\nHmm, wait, let me compute that. Let me factor out the constants:\n\nH = -(gamma B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y. So H t / \u0127 = -(gamma B / 2) \u03c3y t.\n\nThus, U(t) = exp( i (gamma B / 2) \u03c3y t )\n\nWait, but the exponential of i times a Pauli matrix multiplied by some scalar. Let me recall that for a Pauli matrix \u03c3, exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3) = I cos\u03b8 + i \u03c3 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo let me set \u03b8 = (gamma B t / 2). Then,\n\nU(t) = I cos\u03b8 + i \u03c3y sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, but \u03c3y is a Hermitian matrix, so the exponential is unitary, which makes sense.\n\nNow, the initial state of the spin. Initially, the field was along +Z, and the spin was aligned with the field, so the state was |+z>, which is the eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nExpressed in terms of Pauli matrices, |+z> is the state (1, 0) in the computational basis.\n\nSo the initial state |\u03c8(0)> is |+z> = [1; 0].\n\nNow, the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)> = U(t) |\u03c8(0)>.\n\nSo let's compute U(t) |+z>:\n\nU(t) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y.\n\nSo U(t) |+z> = [ cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y ] [1; 0 ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nI [1;0] = [1; 0].\n\n\u03c3y [1;0] = [0, -i; i, 0 ] [1;0] = [0; i].\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nU(t) |+z> = cos\u03b8 [1;0] + i sin\u03b8 [0; i] * [1;0] ?\n\nWait, no, wait. The matrix multiplication is:\n\nU(t) |+z> = [ (cos\u03b8)(1) + (i sin\u03b8)(0) , (cos\u03b8)(0) + (i sin\u03b8)(i) ) ]^T ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute each component.\n\nWait, wait, U(t) is a 2x2 matrix:\n\nU(t) = [ [cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8 ],\n          [i sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8 ] ]\n\nWait, wait, because \u03c3y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when multiplied by i sin\u03b8, it becomes [[0, -i^2 sin\u03b8], [i^2 sin\u03b8, 0]] = [[0, sin\u03b8], [-sin\u03b8, 0]], since i^2 = -1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the expansion.\n\nWait, \u03c3y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So i \u03c3y = [[0, -i^2], [i^2, 0]] = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]].\n\nWait, no, wait: i * \u03c3y = i * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] = [[0 * i, (-i)*i ], [i*i, 0 *i]] = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]].\n\nAh, right. So then, the matrix U(t) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y.\n\nI is [[1,0],[0,1]], so cos\u03b8 I is [[cos\u03b8,0],[0,cos\u03b8]].\n\ni sin\u03b8 \u03c3y is [[0,1],[-1,0]] multiplied by sin\u03b8.\n\nSo U(t) = [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [-sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8]].\n\nWait, because:\n\nU(t) = cos\u03b8 * I + sin\u03b8 * (i \u03c3y).\n\nWait, no, let me compute each term:\n\nU(t) = cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,1]] + sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[-1,0]].\n\nWhich gives:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, 0]       [0, sin\u03b8]  ]\n[ [0, cos\u03b8] ] + [ -sin\u03b8, 0 ]\n\nSo adding together:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [-sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8] ]\n\nSo yes, U(t) is a rotation matrix in the x-y plane, but I think it's actually a rotation around the y-axis because the Hamiltonian is in the y-direction.\n\nWait, no. The time evolution under H = \u03c9 Sy leads to precession around the y-axis, so the state vector precesses in the x-z plane, not the x-y plane. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of spin precession.\n\nBut regardless, let's compute the state |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nThe initial state is |+z> = [1, 0]^T.\n\nSo U(t) |+z> = [ cos\u03b8 * 1 + sin\u03b8 * 0, \n                -sin\u03b8 *1 + cos\u03b8 * 0 ]^T ?\n\nWait, no, no, matrix multiplication: first element is (row 1 of U) dot (column vector).\n\nSo U(t) |+z> = [ cos\u03b8 * 1 + sin\u03b8 * 0, \n                (-sin\u03b8) * 1 + cos\u03b8 * 0 ]^T ?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me write it properly.\n\nU(t) is [[a, b], [c, d]], then U(t) |+z> is [a*1 + b*0, c*1 + d*0 ]^T = [a, c]^T.\n\nSo in our case, a = cos\u03b8, b = sin\u03b8, c = -sin\u03b8, d = cos\u03b8.\n\nSo |\u03c8(t)> = [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ]^T.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the first element is a*1 + b*0 = a = cos\u03b8.\n\nThe second element is c*1 + d*0 = c = -sin\u03b8.\n\nSo |\u03c8(t)> = [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ]^T.\n\nWait, but wait, that's a state vector. Now, the expectation value of Sz is given by <\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nSz is (\u0127/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n\nSo let's compute <Sz>:\n\n<\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)> = (1/2) [ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ] * [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [ cos\u03b8; -sin\u03b8 ]\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, the matrix multiplication:\n\n[[1,0],[0,-1]] * [ cos\u03b8; -sin\u03b8 ] = [ cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8 ].\n\nThen, the outer product with [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8]:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 ] = cos^2\u03b8 + sin^2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo <Sz> = (1/2) * (cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8) )? Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.\n\nThe expectation value is (1/2) [ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ] * [ cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8 ].\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me do the calculation correctly.\n\nThe expectation value <Sz> is (1/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8] ] * [[1 0],[0 -1]] * [cos\u03b8; -sin\u03b8].\n\nCompute the matrix multiplication first:\n\n[[1 0],[0 -1]] * [cos\u03b8; -sin\u03b8 ] = [cos\u03b8, 0*cos\u03b8 + 0*(-sin\u03b8) ]? No, wait, matrix multiplication is row times column.\n\nWait, [[1 0], [0 -1]] multiplied by [cos\u03b8; -sin\u03b8] is:\n\nFirst element: 1 * cos\u03b8 + 0 * (-sin\u03b8) = cos\u03b8.\n\nSecond element: 0 * cos\u03b8 + (-1) * (-sin\u03b8) = sin\u03b8.\n\nSo the result is [cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8].\n\nNow, the outer product [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8] multiplied by [cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8] is cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, no. [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8] is a row vector, [cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8] is a column vector. The product is cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 = cos^2\u03b8 + sin^2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo <Sz> = (1/2) * (1) = 1/2 \u0127/2? Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, the spin operator Sz is (\u0127/2) \u03c3z. So the expectation value is (\u0127/2) times the expectation value of \u03c3z.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should compute it again.\n\nWait, the expectation value is (1/2) times the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using the state vector.\n\nThe state |\u03c8(t)> is [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ]^T.\n\nSo the expectation value of Sz is (\u0127/2) times [ <\u03c8| \u03c3z |\u03c8> ].\n\n\u03c3z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n\nSo <\u03c3z> = [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ] * [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [ cos\u03b8; -sin\u03b8 ]\n\nWhich is [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ] * [ cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8 ].\n\nWait, no. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nCompute the matrix product \u03c3z |\u03c8(t)>:\n\n\u03c3z |\u03c8(t)> = [ [1 * cos\u03b8 + 0*(-sin\u03b8) ], [0 * cos\u03b8 + (-1)*(-sin\u03b8) ] ] = [ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ].\n\nThen, the inner product <\u03c8(t)| \u03c3z |\u03c8(t)> is [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ] * [ cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8 ] = cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 + (-sin\u03b8) * sin\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos(2\u03b8).\n\nSo <Sz> = (\u0127/2) * cos(2\u03b8).\n\nBut \u03b8 is gamma B t / 2.\n\nWait, no, earlier we set \u03b8 = gamma B t / 2.\n\nWait, no, in the expression for U(t), theta was (gamma B t / 2). Because H was H = - gamma B Sy = - (gamma B \u0127/2) \u03c3y. So the time evolution operator had theta = (gamma B t / 2).\n\nWait, no, let me recheck.\n\nH = - gamma B Sy.\n\nSy is (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. So H = - gamma B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (gamma B Sy t) / \u0127 )\n\nWait, H = - gamma B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y.\n\nSo H t / \u0127 = - gamma B (\u0127/2 \u03c3y) t / \u0127 = - gamma B t (\u03c3y) / 2.\n\nSo the exponent is -i * [ - gamma B t \u03c3y / 2 ] = i gamma B t \u03c3y / 2.\n\nSo the exponential is exp( i gamma B t \u03c3y / 2 ).\n\nSo when I expand the exponential, the angle theta is (gamma B t / 2) because the exponent is i theta sigma_y.\n\nWait, no, the expansion for exp(i theta sigma_y) is I cos theta + i sigma_y sin theta.\n\nSo in this case, theta is gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo the expectation value <Sz> is (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta) = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nBecause 2 theta is gamma B t.\n\nSo <Sz> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The magnetic moment mu is gamma S_z.\n\nWait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, so the z-component of the magnetic moment is mu_z = gamma <Sz>.\n\nSo <mu_z> = gamma <Sz> = gamma ( \u0127/2 cos(gamma B t) )\n\nBut wait, \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. So the expectation value oscillates as cos(gamma B t). So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, the frequency of oscillation in the average value is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, divided by 2\u03c0. So the oscillation frequency is (gamma B)/(2\u03c0) times 2\u03c0, which is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The time dependence is cos(gamma B t). So the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B/(2 pi). But the question asks for the frequency, which is usually the number of cycles per second, so the angular frequency is omega, which is gamma B.\n\nWait, no, wait. The options are given in terms of gamma B, so perhaps the question is using frequency in terms of angular frequency (omega), not cycles per second.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) gamma B /2\n\nB) gamma B\n\nC) sqrt(2) gamma B\n\nD) gamma B / sqrt(2)\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which matches option B.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the expectation value oscillates as cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B, so the frequency (angular) is option B.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because when you have a spin precessing around an axis, the frequency depends on the strength of the field and the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nWait, another approach: The energy levels when the magnetic field is along Y are E = \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2), right?\n\nThe energy difference between the two levels is gamma B \u0127. The frequency of oscillations between the states is given by delta E / hbar, which is gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the setup: There's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same strength B. They're asking about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The spin is aligned with the field, right? So the magnetic moment mu is in the same direction as the field. But when the field is suddenly changed to Y, the situation changes. Since the magnetic field direction changes, the particle's spin precesses around the new field direction.\n\nI remember that in such cases, the spin will precess, and this precession leads to oscillations in the expectation values of the spin components. But how does this affect the z-component?\n\nLet me think about the Hamiltonian. The magnetic moment mu interacts with the magnetic field B through the Zeeman term. The Hamiltonian should be H = -mu \u00b7 B. Since mu is gamma Sz, and the field is along Y after the change, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B (Sz) times some direction? Wait, no, wait. Wait, mu is gamma S, right? So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector (Sx, Sy, Sz). So the interaction energy is H = - mu \u00b7 B. Since B is along Y after the switch, H = - gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, no. Wait, mu is a vector, and B is a vector, so their dot product is mu \u00b7 B. So H = - mu \u00b7 B = -gamma (Sx B_x + Sy B_y + Sz B_z). But in the new scenario, B is along +Y, so B_x = 0, B_z = 0, B_y = B. So H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * Sz. Oh wait, is mu = gamma S? Or is mu = gamma * S_z? Wait, the question says mu = gamma * S_z. So wait, that's different. So mu is only in the z-direction? So the magnetic moment is along z, but the field is now along y. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me recheck. The problem states mu = gamma * S_z. Oh, so mu is just the z-component of the spin times gamma. So the magnetic moment vector is only in the z-direction? Or is mu a vector equal to gamma times the spin vector S? Hmm, that's a critical point.\n\nWait, the question says mu is equal to gamma multiplied by Sz. So mu is a vector? Or is mu just a scalar value? Hmm, I think in physics, the magnetic moment is a vector. Oh, but wait, the notation is mu = gamma * S_z. So perhaps mu is a vector pointing in the same direction as S_z, with magnitude gamma times S_z. Wait, but for spin-1/2 particles, S_z can be \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the Hamiltonian. The energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So if mu is gamma Sz, then H = -gamma Sz B \u00b7 something. Wait, if the magnetic field is along Y, then B is (0, B, 0). So H = - gamma Sz * B_y.\n\nWait, but wait, no: mu is a vector, and B is a vector. So the dot product is mu \u00b7 B. So if mu is gamma S, then H = -gamma (S \u00b7 B). But wait, the question says mu = gamma S_z, which would imply that mu is a vector in the z-direction. So mu = gamma S_z \u1e91. So the dot product mu \u00b7 B is gamma S_z B_y, because B is along y.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If mu is a vector, and mu = gamma S_z \u1e91, then when B is along y, the dot product is mu \u00b7 B = (gamma S_z \u1e91) \u00b7 (B \u0233) ) = gamma S_z * B * (\u1e91 \u00b7 \u0233) = 0. Because the z and y unit vectors are perpendicular. So H would be zero?\n\nThat can't be right because the question says that the average of the z-component starts oscillating. So maybe I made a mistake in interpreting mu.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mu is the entire spin vector multiplied by gamma. So mu = gamma S, where S is the vector (Sx, Sy, Sz). Then, the Hamiltonian would be H = - mu \u00b7 B = - gamma (S \u00b7 B). If B is along y, then H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because then the spin would precess around the y-axis. And that would cause the components of spin in x and z to oscillate, perhaps.\n\nWait, but the question says mu = gamma S_z. So I think that's different. Hmm. Maybe I should go back to the question.\n\nQuestion says: mu = gamma S_z. So mu is a vector pointing along z, with magnitude gamma times S_z. So the magnetic moment is along z, regardless of the spin direction. So when B is along y, the interaction is mu \u00b7 B, which is zero because mu is along z and B along y. So H would be zero? Then the spin wouldn't precess, and the average z-component wouldn't oscillate. But the question says it does oscillate. So maybe I'm misunderstanding mu.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mu is a vector that is aligned with the spin direction. So mu = gamma S, the entire vector. Then, when B is along y, the interaction would be H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but the question says mu = gamma S_z, which is just the z-component. So that would mean mu is along z, regardless of the spin's orientation. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that mu is the z-component of the magnetic moment. But then, the magnetic field is along y, so the energy would be H = - mu B cos(theta), where theta is the angle between mu and B. But mu is along z, and B is along y, so the angle is 90 degrees. So cos(theta) is zero, and H is zero. But that can't be right because the oscillation is observed.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe particle has magnetic moment mu = gamma * S_z, aligned with a magnetic field pointing in +Z. So when the field is along +Z, the magnetic moment is aligned, so the energy is minimized. Then, the field is turned off and another turned on along +Y. Both have same magnitude B.\n\nWait, but if mu is along +Z, and the field is turned off, then there's no magnetic field, so the particle's spin should be in a state of zero magnetic field. But then, when the field is turned on along Y, the magnetic moment mu is still along Z, so the interaction would be mu \u00b7 B = mu B cos(theta), theta is 90 degrees. So no interaction. So H is zero. So why would the z-component oscillate?\n\nBut the question says the average z-component oscillates. So I must be misunderstanding something about mu.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mu is the total magnetic moment, which is gamma times the spin vector S. So mu = gamma S. Then, when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the spin will precess about the Y-axis. But how does that affect the expectation value of Sz?\n\nI remember that when a spin is subject to a Hamiltonian proportional to Sy, the spin precesses around the Y-axis. The expectation value of Sx and Sz will oscillate with time. So the average of S_z would vary sinusoidally, right?\n\nSo let's model this. The time evolution of the spin state under H = w Sy, where w is some frequency. The energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies +w/2 and -w/2.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the time evolution operator. The time evolution is given by U = exp(-i H t / \u0127). But since we're dealing with spin-1/2, perhaps using the Pauli matrices would help.\n\nThe spin operators can be written in terms of Pauli matrices: Sx = \u0127/2 \u03c3x, Sy = \u0127/2 \u03c3y, Sz = \u0127/2 \u03c3z.\n\nSo H = -gamma B Sy = -gamma B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. So H = - (gamma B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ). Substituting H:\n\nU(t) = exp( i (gamma B / 2) \u03c3y t )\n\nHmm, wait, let me compute that. Let me factor out the constants:\n\nH = -(gamma B \u0127 / 2) \u03c3y. So H t / \u0127 = -(gamma B / 2) \u03c3y t.\n\nThus, U(t) = exp( i (gamma B / 2) \u03c3y t )\n\nWait, but the exponential of i times a Pauli matrix multiplied by some scalar. Let me recall that for a Pauli matrix \u03c3, exp(i \u03b8 \u03c3) = I cos\u03b8 + i \u03c3 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo let me set \u03b8 = (gamma B t / 2). Then,\n\nU(t) = I cos\u03b8 + i \u03c3y sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, but \u03c3y is a Hermitian matrix, so the exponential is unitary, which makes sense.\n\nNow, the initial state of the spin. Initially, the field was along +Z, and the spin was aligned with the field, so the state was |+z>, which is the eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nExpressed in terms of Pauli matrices, |+z> is the state (1, 0) in the computational basis.\n\nSo the initial state |\u03c8(0)> is |+z> = [1; 0].\n\nNow, the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)> = U(t) |\u03c8(0)>.\n\nSo let's compute U(t) |+z>:\n\nU(t) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y.\n\nSo U(t) |+z> = [ cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y ] [1; 0 ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nI [1;0] = [1; 0].\n\n\u03c3y [1;0] = [0, -i; i, 0 ] [1;0] = [0; i].\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nU(t) |+z> = cos\u03b8 [1;0] + i sin\u03b8 [0; i] * [1;0] ?\n\nWait, no, wait. The matrix multiplication is:\n\nU(t) |+z> = [ (cos\u03b8)(1) + (i sin\u03b8)(0) , (cos\u03b8)(0) + (i sin\u03b8)(i) ) ]^T ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute each component.\n\nWait, wait, U(t) is a 2x2 matrix:\n\nU(t) = [ [cos\u03b8, i sin\u03b8 ],\n          [i sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8 ] ]\n\nWait, wait, because \u03c3y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when multiplied by i sin\u03b8, it becomes [[0, -i^2 sin\u03b8], [i^2 sin\u03b8, 0]] = [[0, sin\u03b8], [-sin\u03b8, 0]], since i^2 = -1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the expansion.\n\nWait, \u03c3y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So i \u03c3y = [[0, -i^2], [i^2, 0]] = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]].\n\nWait, no, wait: i * \u03c3y = i * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] = [[0 * i, (-i)*i ], [i*i, 0 *i]] = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]].\n\nAh, right. So then, the matrix U(t) = cos\u03b8 I + i sin\u03b8 \u03c3y.\n\nI is [[1,0],[0,1]], so cos\u03b8 I is [[cos\u03b8,0],[0,cos\u03b8]].\n\ni sin\u03b8 \u03c3y is [[0,1],[-1,0]] multiplied by sin\u03b8.\n\nSo U(t) = [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [-sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8]].\n\nWait, because:\n\nU(t) = cos\u03b8 * I + sin\u03b8 * (i \u03c3y).\n\nWait, no, let me compute each term:\n\nU(t) = cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,1]] + sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[-1,0]].\n\nWhich gives:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, 0]       [0, sin\u03b8]  ]\n[ [0, cos\u03b8] ] + [ -sin\u03b8, 0 ]\n\nSo adding together:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [-sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8] ]\n\nSo yes, U(t) is a rotation matrix in the x-y plane, but I think it's actually a rotation around the y-axis because the Hamiltonian is in the y-direction.\n\nWait, no. The time evolution under H = \u03c9 Sy leads to precession around the y-axis, so the state vector precesses in the x-z plane, not the x-y plane. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of spin precession.\n\nBut regardless, let's compute the state |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nThe initial state is |+z> = [1, 0]^T.\n\nSo U(t) |+z> = [ cos\u03b8 * 1 + sin\u03b8 * 0, \n                -sin\u03b8 *1 + cos\u03b8 * 0 ]^T ?\n\nWait, no, no, matrix multiplication: first element is (row 1 of U) dot (column vector).\n\nSo U(t) |+z> = [ cos\u03b8 * 1 + sin\u03b8 * 0, \n                (-sin\u03b8) * 1 + cos\u03b8 * 0 ]^T ?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me write it properly.\n\nU(t) is [[a, b], [c, d]], then U(t) |+z> is [a*1 + b*0, c*1 + d*0 ]^T = [a, c]^T.\n\nSo in our case, a = cos\u03b8, b = sin\u03b8, c = -sin\u03b8, d = cos\u03b8.\n\nSo |\u03c8(t)> = [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ]^T.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the first element is a*1 + b*0 = a = cos\u03b8.\n\nThe second element is c*1 + d*0 = c = -sin\u03b8.\n\nSo |\u03c8(t)> = [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ]^T.\n\nWait, but wait, that's a state vector. Now, the expectation value of Sz is given by <\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)>.\n\nSz is (\u0127/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n\nSo let's compute <Sz>:\n\n<\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)> = (1/2) [ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ] * [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [ cos\u03b8; -sin\u03b8 ]\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, the matrix multiplication:\n\n[[1,0],[0,-1]] * [ cos\u03b8; -sin\u03b8 ] = [ cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8 ].\n\nThen, the outer product with [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8]:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 ] = cos^2\u03b8 + sin^2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo <Sz> = (1/2) * (cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8) )? Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.\n\nThe expectation value is (1/2) [ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ] * [ cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8 ].\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me do the calculation correctly.\n\nThe expectation value <Sz> is (1/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8] ] * [[1 0],[0 -1]] * [cos\u03b8; -sin\u03b8].\n\nCompute the matrix multiplication first:\n\n[[1 0],[0 -1]] * [cos\u03b8; -sin\u03b8 ] = [cos\u03b8, 0*cos\u03b8 + 0*(-sin\u03b8) ]? No, wait, matrix multiplication is row times column.\n\nWait, [[1 0], [0 -1]] multiplied by [cos\u03b8; -sin\u03b8] is:\n\nFirst element: 1 * cos\u03b8 + 0 * (-sin\u03b8) = cos\u03b8.\n\nSecond element: 0 * cos\u03b8 + (-1) * (-sin\u03b8) = sin\u03b8.\n\nSo the result is [cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8].\n\nNow, the outer product [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8] multiplied by [cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8] is cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, no. [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8] is a row vector, [cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8] is a column vector. The product is cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 = cos^2\u03b8 + sin^2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo <Sz> = (1/2) * (1) = 1/2 \u0127/2? Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, the spin operator Sz is (\u0127/2) \u03c3z. So the expectation value is (\u0127/2) times the expectation value of \u03c3z.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should compute it again.\n\nWait, the expectation value is (1/2) times the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using the state vector.\n\nThe state |\u03c8(t)> is [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ]^T.\n\nSo the expectation value of Sz is (\u0127/2) times [ <\u03c8| \u03c3z |\u03c8> ].\n\n\u03c3z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]].\n\nSo <\u03c3z> = [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ] * [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [ cos\u03b8; -sin\u03b8 ]\n\nWhich is [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ] * [ cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8 ].\n\nWait, no. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nCompute the matrix product \u03c3z |\u03c8(t)>:\n\n\u03c3z |\u03c8(t)> = [ [1 * cos\u03b8 + 0*(-sin\u03b8) ], [0 * cos\u03b8 + (-1)*(-sin\u03b8) ] ] = [ cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8 ].\n\nThen, the inner product <\u03c8(t)| \u03c3z |\u03c8(t)> is [ cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 ] * [ cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8 ] = cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 + (-sin\u03b8) * sin\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos(2\u03b8).\n\nSo <Sz> = (\u0127/2) * cos(2\u03b8).\n\nBut \u03b8 is gamma B t / 2.\n\nWait, no, earlier we set \u03b8 = gamma B t / 2.\n\nWait, no, in the expression for U(t), theta was (gamma B t / 2). Because H was H = - gamma B Sy = - (gamma B \u0127/2) \u03c3y. So the time evolution operator had theta = (gamma B t / 2).\n\nWait, no, let me recheck.\n\nH = - gamma B Sy.\n\nSy is (\u0127/2) \u03c3y. So H = - gamma B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (gamma B Sy t) / \u0127 )\n\nWait, H = - gamma B (\u0127/2) \u03c3y.\n\nSo H t / \u0127 = - gamma B (\u0127/2 \u03c3y) t / \u0127 = - gamma B t (\u03c3y) / 2.\n\nSo the exponent is -i * [ - gamma B t \u03c3y / 2 ] = i gamma B t \u03c3y / 2.\n\nSo the exponential is exp( i gamma B t \u03c3y / 2 ).\n\nSo when I expand the exponential, the angle theta is (gamma B t / 2) because the exponent is i theta sigma_y.\n\nWait, no, the expansion for exp(i theta sigma_y) is I cos theta + i sigma_y sin theta.\n\nSo in this case, theta is gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo the expectation value <Sz> is (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta) = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ).\n\nBecause 2 theta is gamma B t.\n\nSo <Sz> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The magnetic moment mu is gamma S_z.\n\nWait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, so the z-component of the magnetic moment is mu_z = gamma <Sz>.\n\nSo <mu_z> = gamma <Sz> = gamma ( \u0127/2 cos(gamma B t) )\n\nBut wait, \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. So the expectation value oscillates as cos(gamma B t). So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, the frequency of oscillation in the average value is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, divided by 2\u03c0. So the oscillation frequency is (gamma B)/(2\u03c0) times 2\u03c0, which is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The time dependence is cos(gamma B t). So the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B/(2 pi). But the question asks for the frequency, which is usually the number of cycles per second, so the angular frequency is omega, which is gamma B.\n\nWait, no, wait. The options are given in terms of gamma B, so perhaps the question is using frequency in terms of angular frequency (omega), not cycles per second.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) gamma B /2\n\nB) gamma B\n\nC) sqrt(2) gamma B\n\nD) gamma B / sqrt(2)\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which matches option B.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the expectation value oscillates as cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B, so the frequency (angular) is option B.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because when you have a spin precessing around an axis, the frequency depends on the strength of the field and the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nWait, another approach: The energy levels when the magnetic field is along Y are E = \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127/2), right?\n\nThe energy difference between the two levels is gamma B \u0127. The frequency of oscillations between the states is given by delta E / hbar, which is gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and replaced with a magnetic field of the same magnitude $B$ along the $+y$ direction. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment.\n\n### Key Analysis\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:  \n   The magnetic moment $\\mu$ is proportional to $S_z$, and the initial magnetic field is along $+z$. When the field is suddenly switched to $+y$, the particle's spin precesses around the new field direction.\n\n2. **Hamiltonian**:  \n   The interaction energy of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field is given by $H = -\\mu \\cdot B$.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nAlright, let's break down the problem. The particle has a spin 1/2, which means its spin can be either up or down in the z-direction. It's initially aligned with a magnetic field along +Z. So the magnetic moment mu is gamma times Sz, right? Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nInitially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the particle's moment is aligned with the field. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes too. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field via the Hamiltonian H = -mu\u00b7B. Oh wait, actually, I think the interaction energy is H = -mu\u00b7B, but for spin, it's H = -gamma S \u00b7 B. Or wait, mu is gamma Sz, so H would be -mu\u00b7B. So in the initial state, the field is along Z, so H is proportional to Sz.\n\nBut when the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. Oh, because B is along Y now. So the Hamiltonian changes from being along Z to Y.\n\nSo the particle's state was an eigenstate of Sz before the field change, but after the field changes, the Hamiltonian is now in the Sy direction. So the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, leading to time evolution and oscillations.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment. So we're looking at <mu_z> as a function of time.\n\nLet me recall. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so mu_z is gamma S_z. So the average of mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of S_z.\n\nSo we need to find d(t) = <S_z> as a function of time, and then find its oscillation frequency.\n\nThe initial state is when the field is along Z. Since the particle is spin 1/2, the state is either |+z> or |-z>. Let's assume it's in an eigenstate of S_z, say |+z>. But wait, the problem says the magnetic moment is aligned with the field. Since B was along +Z, the particle's moment is along +Z, so the state is |+z>.\n\nWhen the field is turned off and then turned on along +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. So H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, because mu is gamma S, and H = -mu\u00b7B. So H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, or is it H = gamma B S_y? Because if the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, then the energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So H = -mu \u00b7 B = -gamma S \u00b7 B. So if B is in +Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but the sign might not matter for the frequency. Or maybe it affects the phase, but not the frequency. So I'll proceed.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is governed by the Hamiltonian. Since the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z, but not of S_y.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). Let me write H as H = -gamma B S_y. So H = -gamma B (S_y). Let me write the spin operator S_y in terms of Pauli matrices. S_y = (\u0127/2) sigma_y. So H = -gamma B (\u0127/2) sigma_y.\n\nSo H = (- gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) sigma_y. So the exponential becomes exp( i (gamma B \u0127 / 2) sigma_y t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (gamma B / 2) sigma_y t )\n\nWait, wait, because H is -gamma B S_y. So U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (gamma B S_y t) / \u0127 ). Because H is negative, the exponent becomes positive.\n\nWait, S_y is \u0127/2 sigma_y. So substituting, H = -gamma B ( \u0127/2 sigma_y ). So H = -(gamma B \u0127/2) sigma_y. So U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (gamma B / 2) sigma_y t )\n\nSo U(t) = exp( i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y )\n\nThe initial state is |+z>, which is the eigenstate of S_z. So |psi(0)> = |+z> = (1, 0)^T.\n\nWe can express |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H. Alternatively, since H is proportional to S_y, its eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of S_z as a function of time.\n\nSo <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>\n\nWe can write S_z in terms of Pauli matrices. S_z = (\u0127/2) sigma_z. So the expectation value is (\u0127/2) <psi(t)| sigma_z |psi(t)>.\n\nSo let's compute |psi(t)> = U(t) |+z>.\n\nU(t) is e^{i theta sigma_y}, where theta = (gamma B t / 2). Because the exponent is i (gamma B t/2) sigma_y.\n\nWe can expand the exponential using Euler's formula. Remember that e^{i theta sigma_y} = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta).\n\nSo U(t) = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta).\n\nSo applying U(t) to |+z>:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta) ] |+z>\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst, cos(theta) I |+z> = cos(theta) |+z>\n\nSecond, sigma_y |+z> is sigma_y (1, 0)^T = (0,1; -1,0)(1;0) = (0; -1). So sigma_y |+z> = | -z > multiplied by -i? Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, sigma_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So sigma_y |+z> is sigma_y (1, 0)^T.\n\nSo [0 *1 + (-i)*0, i*1 + 0 *0 ]^T? Wait, no, matrix multiplication:\n\nsigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo sigma_y acting on (1, 0)^T is [0*1 + (-i)*0, i*1 + 0*0]^T = (0, i)^T. But wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of |+z> as (1,0), then sigma_y |+z> is (0, i), which is i times | -z >, because | -z > is (0,1).\n\nWait, because sigma_y |+z> = i | -z >, since sigma_y = i (|+z><-z| - | -z ><+z| )\n\nSo sigma_y |+z> = i | -z >.\n\nTherefore, the second term: i sigma_y sin(theta) |+z> = i (i | -z > ) sin(theta) ) = i^2 | -z > sin(theta) = (-1) | -z > sin(theta).\n\nPutting it together:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ cos(theta) |+z> ] + [ (- sin(theta) ) | -z > ]\n\nSo |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) | -z >.\n\nNow, compute <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.\n\nS_z is (\u0127/2) sigma_z. Sigma_z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSo let's compute <psi(t)| sigma_z |psi(t)>\n\nExpressed as |+z> = (1,0), | -z> = (0,1)\n\n|psi(t)> is [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.\n\nSo sigma_z |psi(t)> = [[1,0],[0,-1]] [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] = [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T.\n\nThen <psi(t)| sigma_z |psi(t)> is [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T\n\n= cos^2(theta) + (- sin(theta))(sin(theta)).\n\nWait, no: it's the inner product, so (cos(theta) * cos(theta)) + ( (- sin(theta)) * sin(theta) )\n\nWhich is cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = cos(2 theta).\n\nSo <S_z> = (\u0127/2) * cos(2 theta)\n\nBut theta is (gamma B t / 2), so 2 theta is gamma B t.\n\nSo <S_z> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the magnetic moment mu_z is gamma S_z. So the average mu_z is gamma <S_z> = gamma ( \u0127/2 cos(gamma B t) )\n\nWait, wait, no: mu_z = gamma S_z, so <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos(gamma B t )\n\nWait, but wait, S_z has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So <S_z> is (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta), but theta is (gamma B t / 2), so 2 theta is gamma B t.\n\nSo <mu_z> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWait, but this would have frequency gamma B. Because the argument of cosine is gamma B t.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component. So the frequency would be gamma B.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options are:\n\nA) gamma*B/2\n\nB) gamma*B\n\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nSo according to my calculation, the frequency is gamma B. So the answer would be option B.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check my steps again. Because sometimes when you change the basis, the frequency might be affected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion of U(t). Let's go through it again.\n\nH is proportional to S_y, and the time evolution is given by the exponential. So U(t) is e^{i theta sigma_y}, where theta is (gamma B t/2).\n\nThe expansion of e^{i theta sigma_y} is I cos(theta) + i sigma_y sin(theta).\n\nYes, because for any Pauli matrix sigma, e^{i theta sigma} = I cos(theta) + i sigma sin(theta).\n\nSo when we apply this to |+z>, which is (1, 0)^T, the result is:\n\n[cos(theta) I (1,0) ] + [i sigma_y sin(theta) (1,0) ]\n\nAs before, sigma_y (1,0) is (0, i)^T, so the second term is i * (0, i)^T sin(theta) = (0, - sin(theta) )^T.\n\nSo the state is [cos(theta), - sin(theta)]^T, which is correct.\n\nThen, when calculating <S_z>, which is (\u0127/2) sigma_z, we have the expectation value as (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ] = (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta).\n\nWait, but 2 theta is 2*(gamma B t/2) )= gamma B t.\n\nSo the oscillation is in cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the average of mu_z oscillates at gamma B.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B) gamma*B.\n\nWait, but another thought: the energy levels when the field is along Y would have energies proportional to S_y. The energy difference between the two eigenstates would be 2 (gamma B \u0127/2 )= gamma B \u0127.\n\nWait, the energy levels are E_+ and E_-, which are (gamma B \u0127/2) and (-gamma B \u0127/2 ), because H = -gamma B S_y. So the energy difference is gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So frequency nu = (E_+ - E_-)/\u0127 = (gamma B \u0127 ) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nSo the frequency is gamma B, so option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nAlright, let's break down the problem. The particle has a spin 1/2, which means its spin can be either up or down in the z-direction. It's initially aligned with a magnetic field along +Z. So the magnetic moment mu is gamma times Sz, right? Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nInitially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the particle's moment is aligned with the field. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes too. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field via the Hamiltonian H = -mu\u00b7B. Oh wait, actually, I think the interaction energy is H = -mu\u00b7B, but for spin, it's H = -gamma S \u00b7 B. Or wait, mu is gamma Sz, so H would be -mu\u00b7B. So in the initial state, the field is along Z, so H is proportional to Sz.\n\nBut when the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. Oh, because B is along Y now. So the Hamiltonian changes from being along Z to Y.\n\nSo the particle's state was an eigenstate of Sz before the field change, but after the field changes, the Hamiltonian is now in the Sy direction. So the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, leading to time evolution and oscillations.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment. So we're looking at <mu_z> as a function of time.\n\nLet me recall. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so mu_z is gamma S_z. So the average of mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of S_z.\n\nSo we need to find d(t) = <S_z> as a function of time, and then find its oscillation frequency.\n\nThe initial state is when the field is along Z. Since the particle is spin 1/2, the state is either |+z> or |-z>. Let's assume it's in an eigenstate of S_z, say |+z>. But wait, the problem says the magnetic moment is aligned with the field. Since B was along +Z, the particle's moment is along +Z, so the state is |+z>.\n\nWhen the field is turned off and then turned on along +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. So H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, because mu is gamma S, and H = -mu\u00b7B. So H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, or is it H = gamma B S_y? Because if the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, then the energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So H = -mu \u00b7 B = -gamma S \u00b7 B. So if B is in +Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but the sign might not matter for the frequency. Or maybe it affects the phase, but not the frequency. So I'll proceed.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is governed by the Hamiltonian. Since the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z, but not of S_y.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). Let me write H as H = -gamma B S_y. So H = -gamma B (S_y). Let me write the spin operator S_y in terms of Pauli matrices. S_y = (\u0127/2) sigma_y. So H = -gamma B (\u0127/2) sigma_y.\n\nSo H = (- gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) sigma_y. So the exponential becomes exp( i (gamma B \u0127 / 2) sigma_y t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (gamma B / 2) sigma_y t )\n\nWait, wait, because H is -gamma B S_y. So U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (gamma B S_y t) / \u0127 ). Because H is negative, the exponent becomes positive.\n\nWait, S_y is \u0127/2 sigma_y. So substituting, H = -gamma B ( \u0127/2 sigma_y ). So H = -(gamma B \u0127/2) sigma_y. So U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (gamma B / 2) sigma_y t )\n\nSo U(t) = exp( i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y )\n\nThe initial state is |+z>, which is the eigenstate of S_z. So |psi(0)> = |+z> = (1, 0)^T.\n\nWe can express |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H. Alternatively, since H is proportional to S_y, its eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of S_z as a function of time.\n\nSo <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>\n\nWe can write S_z in terms of Pauli matrices. S_z = (\u0127/2) sigma_z. So the expectation value is (\u0127/2) <psi(t)| sigma_z |psi(t)>.\n\nSo let's compute |psi(t)> = U(t) |+z>.\n\nU(t) is e^{i theta sigma_y}, where theta = (gamma B t / 2). Because the exponent is i (gamma B t/2) sigma_y.\n\nWe can expand the exponential using Euler's formula.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nSo, the problem is about a spin-1/2 particle. It's got a magnetic moment mu, which is equal to gamma times Sz. The magnetic field was initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's moment was aligned with it. Then, the magnetic field is switched off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. After that, the average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. We need to find the oscillation frequency.\n\nHmm, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes too. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the energy depends on their alignment. For a magnetic moment mu in a magnetic field B, the energy is -mu\u00b7B. Since the particle is spin-1/2, we can model this using spin matrices.\n\nInitially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the Hamiltonian would be H_initial = -gamma * B * Sz. But then the field is turned off and turned on along +Y. So the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -gamma * B * Sy, since the field is along Y now. Wait, but wait, the moment is mu = gamma * S, so I think the correct expression is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nBut wait, when the field is turned off and then on along Y, the system's state might change. I think when the magnetic field changes direction, the state of the spin doesn't change instantaneously, but the time evolution will be governed by the new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe initial state is aligned with the +Z direction. So the initial state is |+z>, which is the eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +1/2 (since spin-1/2, Sz is \u0127/2 times the Pauli matrix, but I think the actual value depends on units. Wait, maybe I should just think in terms of the eigenstates.)\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. When the Hamiltonian changes to H = gamma B Sy (since mu is gamma S, and the energy is -mu\u00b7B, so H = -gamma B Sy?), no, wait. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the energy is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So when B is in the Y direction, H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but wait, the original setup had the magnetic field along Z, so the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. After the field is changed to Y, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, so it will evolve over time.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation of the expectation value of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z. Since mu_z is gamma Sz, the expectation value of mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of Sz.\n\nSo we need to find how <Sz> oscillates over time. The oscillation frequency will come from the energy difference between the states involved.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. After the Hamiltonian changes to H = -gamma B Sy, the state is no longer an eigenstate of H. So the time evolution will cause the state to change, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nWait, but wait, when the Hamiltonian changes, the time evolution is governed by the new H. So the state at time t after the switch will be |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |+z>, assuming we're in the interaction picture and the change happens suddenly.\n\nWait, but let's make sure about the units. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \u00b11, and S = \u0127/2 sigma. So, Sz is \u0127/2 sigma_z, Sy is \u0127/2 sigma_y.\n\nSo, the Hamiltonian H is H = - mu \u00b7 B. Since mu = gamma S, H = - gamma B (S \u00b7 direction). So when B is along Y, H = -gamma B Sy = -gamma B (\u0127/2 sigma_y) = (-i gamma B \u0127/2 ) sigma_y? Wait, wait, no, Sy is (\u0127/2) sigma_y, so H = -gamma B (\u0127/2 sigma_y).\n\nWait, but perhaps I should express everything in terms of angular frequency. Let's see, the energy levels are given by the eigenvalues of H. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are \u00b11, so the eigenvalues of H would be -gamma B (\u0127/2) (\u00b11), which are \u00b1 (-gamma B \u0127/2). Wait, no, wait: sigma_y has eigenvalues \u00b11, so Sy = (\u0127/2) sigma_y, so H = -gamma B Sy = -gamma B (\u0127/2 sigma_y). So the eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (\u00b11). So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (+1) = -gamma B \u0127/2, and E_- = +gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think in terms of angular frequency. The energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = [gamma B \u0127/2] - [- gamma B \u0127/2] = gamma B \u0127. So the frequency omega would be (E_- - E_+)/\u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, because the energy difference is gamma B \u0127, so when you divide by \u0127, you get gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the oscillation frequency of the expectation value is related to the energy difference between the states in the superposition. So the initial state |+z> can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of H.\n\nWait, what are the eigenstates of H? H = -gamma B (\u0127/2) sigma_y. Sigma_y has eigenstates |+y> and |-y>, which are the spin-up and spin-down states along Y. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are +1 and -1, so the eigenstates of H are the same as those of sigma_y, because H is proportional to sigma_y.\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>. The states |+y> and |-y> are linear combinations of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nSpecifically, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, let's compute that. |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the expansion:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) ?\n\nWait, no, I think that's the other way around. Wait, the standard expressions are:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo if I solve for |+z> and |-z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:\n\nAdding the two equations:\n|+y> + |-y> = 2|+z> / sqrt(2)\n=> |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSimilarly, subtracting:\n|+y> - |-y> = 2| -z > / sqrt(2)\n=> |-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo when the Hamiltonian is H, the state |+z> can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of H. Each eigenstate will evolve with a phase factor exp(-i E t / \u0127).\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [exp(-i E_+ t/\u0127) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t/\u0127) |-y> ]\n\nWhere E_+ is the eigenvalue for |+y>, which is E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2)(1) = -gamma B \u0127/2. Similarly, E_- is E_- = -gamma B (\u0127/2)(-1) ) = +gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nSo the time evolution factors are:\n\nexp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (gamma B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 ) ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSimilarly, exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i (gamma B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 ) ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y> ]\n\nNow, we need to find the expectation value of Sz. Since mu_z is gamma Sz, the expectation value of mu_z is gamma <Sz>.\n\nLet me compute <Sz> = <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>.\n\nExpressed in the basis of |+y> and |-y>, Sz can be written as:\n\nSz = (\u0127/2) sigma_z.\n\nBut in the |+y> basis, sigma_z can be represented as a matrix. Alternatively, we can express Sz in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express Sz in terms of the computational basis and then compute <Sz> using the state |psi(t)>.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to express the state |psi(t)> in the |+z> and |-z> basis and compute <Sz>.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute <Sz> using the state as expressed.\n\nWait, let's write |psi(t)> as:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ exp(i theta) |+y> + exp(-i theta) |-y> ]\n\nwhere theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nNow, let's express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting into |psi(t)>:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ exp(i theta) (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + exp(-i theta) (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) ]\n\nSimplify this:\n\n= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))) ) [ exp(i theta)(|+z> + |-z>) + exp(-i theta)(|+z> - |-z>) ]\n\n= (1/2) [ exp(i theta)(|+z> + |-z>) + exp(-i theta)(|+z> - |-z>) ]\n\nLet me factor out |+z> and |-z>:\n\n= (1/2) [ (exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta)) |+z> + (exp(i theta) - exp(-i theta)) |-z> ]\n\nUsing Euler's formula: exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta) = 2 cos(theta), and exp(i theta) - exp(-i theta) = 2i sin(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> + 2i sin(theta) |-z> ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z>\n\nSo the state |psi(t)> is cos(theta)|+z> + i sin(theta)|-z>, where theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nNow, compute <Sz>:\n\nSz is (\u0127/2) sigma_z, and in the |+z> basis, sigma_z is diagonal with entries [1, -1].\n\nSo, the expectation value <Sz> is:\n\n<psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)> = (\u0127/2) [ |a|^2 (1) + |b|^2 (-1) ]\n\nwhere a and b are the coefficients of |+z> and |-z> in |psi(t)>, respectively.\n\nIn our case, a = cos(theta), b = i sin(theta).\n\nSo |a|^2 = cos^2(theta), |b|^2 = |i sin(theta)|^2 = sin^2(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ) ] = (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta )\n\nBecause cos^2 - sin^2 = cos(2 theta).\n\nBut wait, theta is gamma B t / 2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z = gamma Sz.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma < Sz > = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes factors can get mixed up. The argument of the cosine is gamma B t, which would mean the angular frequency is gamma B, so the frequency f is gamma B/(2 pi).\n\nBut the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is the coefficient inside the cosine divided by 2 pi. But in the answer options, they might be referring to the angular frequency (omega) or the regular frequency (f). Wait, looking at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma B, which would be the angular frequency. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nWait, the Hamiltonian after the switch is H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nSy is (\u0127/2) sigma_y.\n\nSo H = - gamma B (\u0127/2 sigma_y) ) = (- gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) sigma_y.\n\nThe eigenvalues of sigma_y are \u00b11, so the eigenvalues of H are (- gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) * (+1) and (- gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) * (-1) ), which are -gamma B \u0127/2 and +gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nThe energy difference between the two states is (gamma B \u0127/2) - (-gamma B \u0127/2 ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe angular frequency omega is (energy difference) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which matches option B.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I computed <Sz>, I got (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B. So the answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the initial steps. The initial state is |+z>, which after the Hamiltonian change, starts evolving under H. The oscillation in <Sz> comes from the difference in phases between the two components of the state in the eigenbasis of H.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is a superposition of the two eigenstates, each with their own phase factors. The difference in the phases leads to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe energy levels are E_+ and E_-, and their difference is 2 gamma B \u0127/2 = gamma B \u0127. So the angular frequency is (E_+ - E_-) / \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) ) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency of <Sz> is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option B is gamma B. So that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait, in the calculation earlier, I got <Sz> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ), which would have a frequency gamma B. So the average of mu_z is gamma * (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B) gamma B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nSo, the problem is about a spin-1/2 particle. It's got a magnetic moment mu, which is equal to gamma times Sz. The magnetic field was initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's moment was aligned with it. Then, the magnetic field is switched off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. After that, the average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. We need to find the oscillation frequency.\n\nHmm, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes too. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the energy depends on their alignment. For a magnetic moment mu in a magnetic field B, the energy is -mu\u00b7B. Since the particle is spin-1/2, we can model this using spin matrices.\n\nInitially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the Hamiltonian would be H_initial = -gamma * B * Sz. But then the field is turned off and turned on along +Y. So the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -gamma * B * Sy, since the field is along Y now. Wait, but wait, the moment is mu = gamma * S, so I think the correct expression is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nBut wait, when the field is turned off and then on along Y, the system's state might change. I think when the magnetic field changes direction, the state of the spin doesn't change instantaneously, but the time evolution will be governed by the new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe initial state is aligned with the +Z direction. So the initial state is |+z>, which is the eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +1/2 (since spin-1/2, Sz is \u0127/2 times the Pauli matrix, but I think the actual value depends on units. Wait, maybe I should just think in terms of the eigenstates.)\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. When the Hamiltonian changes to H = gamma B Sy (since mu is gamma S, and the energy is -mu\u00b7B, so H = -gamma B Sy?), no, wait. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the energy is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So when B is in the Y direction, H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but wait, the original setup had the magnetic field along Z, so the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. After the field is changed to Y, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, so it will evolve over time.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation of the expectation value of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z. Since mu_z is gamma Sz, the expectation value of mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of Sz.\n\nSo we need to find how <Sz> oscillates over time. The oscillation frequency will come from the energy difference between the states involved.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. After the Hamiltonian changes to H = -gamma B Sy, the state is no longer an eigenstate of H. So the time evolution will cause the state to change, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nWait, but wait, when the Hamiltonian changes, the time evolution is governed by the new H. So the state at time t after the switch will be |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127) |+z>, assuming we're in the interaction picture and the change happens suddenly.\n\nWait, but let's make sure about the units. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \u00b11, and S = \u0127/2 sigma. So, Sz is \u0127/2 sigma_z, Sy is \u0127/2 sigma_y.\n\nSo, the Hamiltonian H is H = - mu \u00b7 B. Since mu = gamma S, H = - gamma B (S \u00b7 direction). So when B is along Y, H = -gamma B Sy = -gamma B (\u0127/2 sigma_y) = (-i gamma B \u0127/2 ) sigma_y? Wait, wait, no, Sy is (\u0127/2) sigma_y, so H = -gamma B (\u0127/2 sigma_y).\n\nWait, but perhaps I should express everything in terms of angular frequency. Let's see, the energy levels are given by the eigenvalues of H. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are \u00b11, so the eigenvalues of H would be -gamma B (\u0127/2) (\u00b11), which are \u00b1 (-gamma B \u0127/2). Wait, no, wait: sigma_y has eigenvalues \u00b11, so Sy = (\u0127/2) sigma_y, so H = -gamma B Sy = -gamma B (\u0127/2 sigma_y). So the eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (\u00b11). So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (+1) = -gamma B \u0127/2, and E_- = +gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think in terms of angular frequency. The energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = [gamma B \u0127/2] - [- gamma B \u0127/2] = gamma B \u0127. So the frequency omega would be (E_- - E_+)/\u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, because the energy difference is gamma B \u0127, so when you divide by \u0127, you get gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, the oscillation frequency of the expectation value is related to the energy difference between the states in the superposition. So the initial state |+z> can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of H.\n\nWait, what are the eigenstates of H? H = -gamma B (\u0127/2) sigma_y. Sigma_y has eigenstates |+y> and |-y>, which are the spin-up and spin-down states along Y. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are +1 and -1, so the eigenstates of H are the same as those of sigma_y, because H is proportional to sigma_y.\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>. The states |+y> and |-y> are linear combinations of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nSpecifically, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, let's compute that. |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the expansion:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) ?\n\nWait, no, I think that's the other way around. Wait, the standard expressions are:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo if I solve for |+z> and |-z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:\n\nAdding the two equations:\n|+y> + |-y> = 2|+z> / sqrt(2)\n=> |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSimilarly, subtracting:\n|+y> - |-y> = 2| -z > / sqrt(2)\n=> |-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo when the Hamiltonian is H, the state |+z> can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of H. Each eigenstate will evolve with a phase factor exp(-i E t / \u0127).\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [exp(-i E_+ t/\u0127) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t/\u0127) |-y> ]\n\nWhere E_+ is the eigenvalue for |+y>, which is E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2)(1) = -gamma B \u0127/2. Similarly, E_- is E_- = -gamma B (\u0127/2)(-1) ) = +gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nSo the time evolution factors are:\n\nexp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (gamma B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 ) ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSimilarly, exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i (gamma B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 ) ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y> ]\n\nNow, we need to find the expectation value of Sz. Since mu_z is gamma Sz, the expectation value of mu_z is gamma <Sz>.\n\nLet me compute <Sz> = <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>.\n\nExpressed in the basis of |+y> and |-y>, Sz can be written as:\n\nSz = (\u0127/2) sigma_z.\n\nBut in the |+y> basis, sigma_z can be represented as a matrix. Alternatively, we can express Sz in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express Sz in terms of the computational basis and then compute <Sz> using the state |psi(t)>.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to express the state |psi(t)> in the |+z> and |-z> basis and compute <Sz>.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute <Sz> using the state as expressed.\n\nWait, let's write |psi(t)> as:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ exp(i theta) |+y> + exp(-i theta) |-y> ]\n\nwhere theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nNow, let's express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting into |psi(t)>:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ exp(i theta) (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + exp(-i theta) (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) ]\n\nSimplify this:\n\n= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))) ) [ exp(i theta)(|+z> + |-z>) + exp(-i theta)(|+z> - |-z>) ]\n\n= (1/2) [ exp(i theta)(|+z> + |-z>) + exp(-i theta)(|+z> - |-z>) ]\n\nLet me factor out |+z> and |-z>:\n\n= (1/2) [ (exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta)) |+z> + (exp(i theta) - exp(-i theta)) |-z> ]\n\nUsing Euler's formula: exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta) = 2 cos(theta), and exp(i theta) - exp(-i theta) = 2i sin(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> + 2i sin(theta) |-z> ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z>\n\nSo the state |psi(t)> is cos(theta)|+z> + i sin(theta)|-z>, where theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nNow, compute <Sz>:\n\nSz is (\u0127/2) sigma_z, and in the |+z> basis, sigma_z is diagonal with entries [1, -1].\n\nSo, the expectation value <Sz> is:\n\n<psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)> = (\u0127/2) [ |a|^2 (1) + |b|^2 (-1) ]\n\nwhere a and b are the coefficients of |+z> and |-z> in |psi(t)>, respectively.\n\nIn our case, a = cos(theta), b = i sin(theta).\n\nSo |a|^2 = cos^2(theta), |b|^2 = |i sin(theta)|^2 = sin^2(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = (\u0127/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ) ] = (\u0127/2) cos(2 theta )\n\nBecause cos^2 - sin^2 = cos(2 theta).\n\nBut wait, theta is gamma B t / 2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nSo,\n\n<Sz> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z = gamma Sz.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma < Sz > = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes factors can get mixed up. The argument of the cosine is gamma B t, which would mean the angular frequency is gamma B, so the frequency f is gamma B/(2 pi).\n\nBut the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is the coefficient inside the cosine divided by 2 pi. But in the answer options, they might be referring to the angular frequency (omega) or the regular frequency (f). Wait, looking at the options:\n\nOption B is gamma B, which would be the angular frequency. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nWait, the Hamiltonian after the switch is H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nSy is (\u0127/2) sigma_y.\n\nSo H = - gamma B (\u0127/2 sigma_y) ) = (- gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) sigma_y.\n\nThe eigenvalues of sigma_y are \u00b11, so the eigenvalues of H are (- gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) * (+1) and (- gamma B \u0127 / 2 ) * (-1) ), which are -gamma B \u0127/2 and +gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nThe energy difference between the two states is (gamma B \u0127/2) - (-gamma B \u0127/2 ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe angular frequency omega is (energy difference) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which matches option B.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I computed <Sz>, I got (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B. So the answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the initial steps. The initial state is |+z>, which after the Hamiltonian change, starts evolving under H. The oscillation in <Sz> comes from the difference in phases between the two components of the state in the eigenbasis of H.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is a superposition of the two eigenstates, each with their own phase factors. The difference in the phases leads to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe energy levels are E_+ and E_-, and their difference is 2 gamma B \u0127/2 = gamma B \u0127. So the angular frequency is (E_+ - E_-) / \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) ) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency of <Sz> is gamma B, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option B is gamma B. So that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait, in the calculation earlier, I got <Sz> = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ), which would have a frequency gamma B. So the average of mu_z is gamma * (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B) gamma B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. Alright, let's read the question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction, and then it's turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nHmm, spin-1/2 systems are typically described by the Pauli equations. When the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which affects the time evolution of the spin state.\n\nLet me break it down. Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along +Z. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz. So the initial Hamiltonian is probably H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B. Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz, so the energy is proportional to the dot product of mu and B. So the Hamiltonian would be H = - mu \u00b7 B, but wait, the sign might depend on convention. Alternatively, the Hamiltonian for spin in a magnetic field is often written as H = -\u03b3 B \u00b7 S, but I need to get the signs right. Alternatively, maybe H = -\u03bc\u00b7B, where \u03bc is the magnetic moment. Since \u03bc is given as gamma S_z, then H = -gamma S_z B, but considering the direction. Oh wait, if B is in +Z direction, then H_initial = -gamma B S_z.\n\nBut wait, when the magnetic field is turned off, and then another field along +Y is turned on. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -gamma B S_y, since B is now in +Y direction.\n\nWait, but when the field is turned off, the system is no longer subject to the initial Hamiltonian. So after the change, the Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S_y. Or wait, maybe I got the sign wrong. Let me think. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So H = - mu \u00b7 B = -gamma (S \u00b7 B). So if B is along +Z, H = -gamma B S_z. But when the field is along +Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but when the field is turned off, the initial state is the eigenstate of H_initial. Then, when the field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -gamma B S_y.\n\nBut wait, the system is initially in an eigenstate of S_z. Let's say the initial state is |up_z> or |down_z>, since the magnetic field was along Z, so the system would have been in an energy eigenstate of H_initial.\n\nOnce the field is turned off and the new field is applied, the system's state will no longer be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian H_final. So the state will evolve over time, and the expectation values will oscillate.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So we're looking for <mu_z>, which is gamma <S_z>, and how it oscillates in time.\n\nTo find the oscillation frequency, I think I need to find the time dependence of <S_z> under the new Hamiltonian.\n\nLet me model the time evolution. The time evolution of the state is given by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Since the system is no longer in an eigenstate, it will evolve into a superposition of eigenstates of H_final.\n\nH_final is proportional to S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nSo let me write the initial state |psi(0)> in terms of the eigenstates of H_final. The initial state before the field change is, say, |+z>. Because the particle's magnetic moment was aligned with the magnetic field along Z. Wait, the problem states that the magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field. So when B was along +Z, the magnetic moment would be along +Z, so the state is |+z>.\n\nSo |+z> can be expressed as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nLet me recall that:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo solving for |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSimilarly, |-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, under the new Hamiltonian H_final, which is proportional to S_y, the time evolution of each eigenstate is just a phase factor. Because H_final |+y> = E_+ |+y>, similarly H_final |-y> = E_- |-y>.\n\nSo the time evolution of the state is:\n\n|psi(t)> = [e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t / \u0127} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nBut wait, what are E_+ and E_-?\n\nH_final = -gamma B S_y\n\nS_y has eigenvalues \u0127/2 and -\u0127/2 for |+y> and |-y>, respectively.\n\nSo H_final |+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y> \u2192 E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2)\n\nSimilarly, H_final |-y> = gamma B (\u0127/2) |-y> \u2192 E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2)\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check. H_final = -gamma B S_y.\n\nS_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>\nSo H_final |+y> = (-gamma B)(\u0127/2) |+y> \u2192 E_+ = -gamma B \u0127 / 2\n\nSimilarly, S_y |-y> = (-\u0127/2) |-y>\nSo H_final |-y> = (-gamma B)(-\u0127/2) |-y> = (gamma B \u0127/2) |-y> \u2192 E_- = gamma B \u0127 / 2\n\nSo the energies are E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127 ) / 2 and E_- = (gamma B \u0127) / 2.\n\nNow, the state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127 } |+y> + e^{-i E_- t / \u0127 } |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ t/\u0127 = (-gamma B \u0127 / 2) t / \u0127 = - gamma B t / 2\n\nE_- t/\u0127 = (gamma B \u0127 / 2) t / \u0127 = gamma B t / 2\n\nSo the exponents become:\n\ne^{-i (-gamma B t/2)} = e^{i gamma B t / 2 }\n\nand\n\ne^{-i (gamma B t/2)}.\n\nSo |psi(t)> becomes:\n\n[ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, let's express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting these into |psi(t)>:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nFactor out 1/sqrt(2):\n\n= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>) ) + (e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)) ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2))\n\nWhich simplifies to 1/2 factor:\n\n= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) |-z> ] / 2\n\nSimplify the coefficients using Euler's formula.\n\ne^{i\u03b8} + e^{-i\u03b8} = 2 cos\u03b8\n\ne^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8} = 2i sin\u03b8\n\nSo substituting:\n\n= [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + 2i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z> ] / 2\n\nSimplify the 2s:\n\n= cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z>\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>\n\nCompute this expectation value.\n\nBut wait, perhaps an easier way is to compute <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> because mu = gamma S.\n\nSo first, let's compute <S_z>.\n\nExpress |psi(t)> as a combination of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|psi(t)> = cos(\u03b8) |+z> + i sin(\u03b8) |-z>, where \u03b8 = (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo the state is a superposition of |+z> and |-z>, with coefficients cos\u03b8 and i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo when we compute <S_z>, it's the expectation value in this state.\n\nS_z is diagonal in the z-basis, so:\n\n<S_z> = [ cos\u03b8 ]^2 * (\u0127/2) + [ i sin\u03b8 ]^2 * (- \u0127/2 )\n\nBecause |+z> has eigenvalue \u0127/2, |-z> has eigenvalue -\u0127/2.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. The state is:\n\n|psi(t)> = cos\u03b8 |+z> + i sin\u03b8 |-z>\n\nSo when you compute <S_z>, it's the sum over the probabilities times their eigenvalues.\n\nSo:\n\n< S_z > = |cos\u03b8|^2 * (\u0127/2) + |i sin\u03b8|^2 * (-\u0127/2 )\n\nBecause |i|^2 is 1, so |i sin\u03b8|^2 = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = cos\u00b2\u03b8 (\u0127/2) + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ( - \u0127/2 )\n\n= (\u0127/2) ( cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8 )\n\nBecause cos(2\u03b8) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut theta is (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBecause 2\u03b8 = gamma B t.\n\nWait, wait: theta is (gamma B t)/2, so 2 theta is gamma B t.\n\nSo cos(2 theta) is cos(gamma B t).\n\nTherefore,\n\n< S_z > = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nBut the question is about mu_z, which is gamma times S_z.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma < S_z > = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos(gamma B t )\n\nHmm, but wait. The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment, which is <mu_z>.\n\nThe expression is proportional to cos(gamma B t). So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The cosine function has a frequency omega, so the argument is omega t. So in this case, the argument is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the frequency (in Hz) would be gamma B / (2\u03c0), but the question is about the oscillation frequency, which in terms of the argument's coefficient is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B, option D is gamma B over sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but I thought the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the answer would be option B.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the steps.\n\nWait, when I computed <S_z>, I found it was (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t). Then <mu_z> is gamma times that, so (gamma \u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nWait, but wait a second: The magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma S. So mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nBut S_z has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So when you compute <mu_z>, it's gamma times <S_z>.\n\nBut in our calculation, <S_z> is (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t). So <mu_z> is gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nWait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>. So the time dependence is cos(omega t), where omega is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think about the units. Gamma has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1) perhaps, but B is Tesla. So gamma B would have units of rad s^-1, which is angular frequency.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the answer would be option B.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the initial steps. The initial state was |+z>, which is an eigenstate of H_initial (S_z). After the field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian is H_final = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, in my calculation, I set H_final = -gamma B S_y. But wait, the energy expression is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So mu is gamma S, so H = -gamma S \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I took H_final as -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues were -gamma B (\u0127/2) and +gamma B (\u0127/2). Then the energies were E_+ and E_-.\n\nWait, when I computed the time evolution, the exponents were based on E_+ and E_-. So the phase differences would come from the energy differences, leading to the frequency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) )= - gamma B \u0127. But wait, when considering the transition frequency, the energy difference is |E_+ - E_-| = gamma B \u0127. So the angular frequency omega would be (E_+ - E_-)/\u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, the frequency of oscillation is determined by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant.\n\nThe time evolution of the state leads to oscillations at a frequency given by (E_+ - E_-) / \u0127. So (E_+ - E_-) = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) ) = - gamma B \u0127. The absolute value is gamma B \u0127. So the angular frequency is (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo this again leads me to think the frequency is gamma B, so option B.\n\nBut wait, looking at the answer choices, option B is gamma B. So that's the one.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Did I make a mistake in the initial setup? Let me think. Because the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of H_initial. When the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. So the eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, so when the state is expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>, the phases are e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127} and e^{-i E_- t / \u0127}.\n\nSo E_+ is -gamma B \u0127/2, so E_+ t/ \u0127 = (-gamma B t/2) * \u0127 * t? Wait, no, E is in Joules, t in seconds.\n\nWait, E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2), so E_+ t / \u0127 = (-gamma B (\u0127/2) ) * t ) / \u0127 = -gamma B t/ 2.\n\nSimilarly, E_- t/ \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127/2) * t / \u0127 = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo the phases are e^{i gamma B t/2} and e^{-i gamma B t/2}.\n\nWhich when substituted into the state, gives the time evolution as:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nWhich, as we did before, gives <mu_z> oscillating with frequency gamma B.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. Alright, let's read the question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction, and then it's turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nHmm, spin-1/2 systems are typically described by the Pauli equations. When the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which affects the time evolution of the spin state.\n\nLet me break it down. Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along +Z. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz. So the initial Hamiltonian is probably H_initial = - mu \u00b7 B. Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz, so the energy is proportional to the dot product of mu and B. So the Hamiltonian would be H = - mu \u00b7 B, but wait, the sign might depend on convention. Alternatively, the Hamiltonian for spin in a magnetic field is often written as H = -\u03b3 B \u00b7 S, but I need to get the signs right. Alternatively, maybe H = -\u03bc\u00b7B, where \u03bc is the magnetic moment. Since \u03bc is given as gamma S_z, then H = -gamma S_z B, but considering the direction. Oh wait, if B is in +Z direction, then H_initial = -gamma B S_z.\n\nBut wait, when the magnetic field is turned off, and then another field along +Y is turned on. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -gamma B S_y, since B is now in +Y direction.\n\nWait, but when the field is turned off, the system is no longer subject to the initial Hamiltonian. So after the change, the Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S_y. Or wait, maybe I got the sign wrong. Let me think. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So H = - mu \u00b7 B = -gamma (S \u00b7 B). So if B is along +Z, H = -gamma B S_z. But when the field is along +Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but when the field is turned off, the initial state is the eigenstate of H_initial. Then, when the field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -gamma B S_y.\n\nBut wait, the system is initially in an eigenstate of S_z. Let's say the initial state is |up_z> or |down_z>, since the magnetic field was along Z, so the system would have been in an energy eigenstate of H_initial.\n\nOnce the field is turned off and the new field is applied, the system's state will no longer be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian H_final. So the state will evolve over time, and the expectation values will oscillate.\n\nThe question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So we're looking for <mu_z>, which is gamma <S_z>, and how it oscillates in time.\n\nTo find the oscillation frequency, I think I need to find the time dependence of <S_z> under the new Hamiltonian.\n\nLet me model the time evolution. The time evolution of the state is given by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Since the system is no longer in an eigenstate, it will evolve into a superposition of eigenstates of H_final.\n\nH_final is proportional to S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nSo let me write the initial state |psi(0)> in terms of the eigenstates of H_final. The initial state before the field change is, say, |+z>. Because the particle's magnetic moment was aligned with the magnetic field along Z. Wait, the problem states that the magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field. So when B was along +Z, the magnetic moment would be along +Z, so the state is |+z>.\n\nSo |+z> can be expressed as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nLet me recall that:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo solving for |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSimilarly, |-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, under the new Hamiltonian H_final, which is proportional to S_y, the time evolution of each eigenstate is just a phase factor. Because H_final |+y> = E_+ |+y>, similarly H_final |-y> = E_- |-y>.\n\nSo the time evolution of the state is:\n\n|psi(t)> = [e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t / \u0127} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nBut wait, what are E_+ and E_-?\n\nH_final = -gamma B S_y\n\nS_y has eigenvalues \u0127/2 and -\u0127/2 for |+y> and |-y>, respectively.\n\nSo H_final |+y> = -gamma B (\u0127/2) |+y> \u2192 E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2)\n\nSimilarly, H_final |-y> = gamma B (\u0127/2) |-y> \u2192 E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2)\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check. H_final = -gamma B S_y.\n\nS_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y>\nSo H_final |+y> = (-gamma B)(\u0127/2) |+y> \u2192 E_+ = -gamma B \u0127 / 2\n\nSimilarly, S_y |-y> = (-\u0127/2) |-y>\nSo H_final |-y> = (-gamma B)(-\u0127/2) |-y> = (gamma B \u0127/2) |-y> \u2192 E_- = gamma B \u0127 / 2\n\nSo the energies are E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127 ) / 2 and E_- = (gamma B \u0127) / 2.\n\nNow, the state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127 } |+y> + e^{-i E_- t / \u0127 } |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ t/\u0127 = (-gamma B \u0127 / 2) t / \u0127 = - gamma B t / 2\n\nE_- t/\u0127 = (gamma B \u0127 / 2) t / \u0127 = gamma B t / 2\n\nSo the exponents become:\n\ne^{-i (-gamma B t/2)} = e^{i gamma B t / 2 }\n\nand\n\ne^{-i (gamma B t/2)}.\n\nSo |psi(t)> becomes:\n\n[ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, let's express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSubstituting these into |psi(t)>:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nFactor out 1/sqrt(2):\n\n= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>) ) + (e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)) ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2))\n\nWhich simplifies to 1/2 factor:\n\n= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) |-z> ] / 2\n\nSimplify the coefficients using Euler's formula.\n\ne^{i\u03b8} + e^{-i\u03b8} = 2 cos\u03b8\n\ne^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8} = 2i sin\u03b8\n\nSo substituting:\n\n= [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + 2i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z> ] / 2\n\nSimplify the 2s:\n\n= cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z>\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>\n\nCompute this expectation value.\n\nBut wait, perhaps an easier way is to compute <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> because mu = gamma S.\n\nSo first, let's compute <S_z>.\n\nExpress |psi(t)> as a combination of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|psi(t)> = cos(\u03b8) |+z> + i sin(\u03b8) |-z>, where \u03b8 = (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo the state is a superposition of |+z> and |-z>, with coefficients cos\u03b8 and i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo when we compute <S_z>, it's the expectation value in this state.\n\nS_z is diagonal in the z-basis, so:\n\n<S_z> = [ cos\u03b8 ]^2 * (\u0127/2) + [ i sin\u03b8 ]^2 * (- \u0127/2 )\n\nBecause |+z> has eigenvalue \u0127/2, |-z> has eigenvalue -\u0127/2.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. The state is:\n\n|psi(t)> = cos\u03b8 |+z> + i sin\u03b8 |-z>\n\nSo when you compute <S_z>, it's the sum over the probabilities times their eigenvalues.\n\nSo:\n\n< S_z > = |cos\u03b8|^2 * (\u0127/2) + |i sin\u03b8|^2 * (-\u0127/2 )\n\nBecause |i|^2 is 1, so |i sin\u03b8|^2 = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = cos\u00b2\u03b8 (\u0127/2) + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ( - \u0127/2 )\n\n= (\u0127/2) ( cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03b8 )\n\nBecause cos(2\u03b8) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut theta is (gamma B t)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n< S_z > = (\u0127/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBecause 2\u03b8 = gamma B t.\n\nWait, wait: theta is (gamma B t)/2, so 2 theta is gamma B t.\n\nSo cos(2 theta) is cos(gamma B t).\n\nTherefore,\n\n< S_z > = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nBut the question is about mu_z, which is gamma times S_z.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z > = gamma < S_z > = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos(gamma B t )\n\nHmm, but wait. The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment, which is <mu_z>.\n\nThe expression is proportional to cos(gamma B t). So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The cosine function has a frequency omega, so the argument is omega t. So in this case, the argument is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the frequency (in Hz) would be gamma B / (2\u03c0), but the question is about the oscillation frequency, which in terms of the argument's coefficient is gamma B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is gamma B, option D is gamma B over sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but I thought the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the answer would be option B.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the steps.\n\nWait, when I computed <S_z>, I found it was (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t). Then <mu_z> is gamma times that, so (gamma \u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nWait, but wait a second: The magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma S. So mu_z = gamma S_z.\n\nBut S_z has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So when you compute <mu_z>, it's gamma times <S_z>.\n\nBut in our calculation, <S_z> is (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t). So <mu_z> is gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nWait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>. So the time dependence is cos(omega t), where omega is gamma B.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think about the units. Gamma has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1) perhaps, but B is Tesla. So gamma B would have units of rad s^-1, which is angular frequency.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the answer would be option B.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the initial steps. The initial state was |+z>, which is an eigenstate of H_initial (S_z). After the field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian is H_final = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, in my calculation, I set H_final = -gamma B S_y. But wait, the energy expression is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So mu is gamma S, so H = -gamma S \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I took H_final as -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues were -gamma B (\u0127/2) and +gamma B (\u0127/2). Then the energies were E_+ and E_-.\n\nWait, when I computed the time evolution, the exponents were based on E_+ and E_-. So the phase differences would come from the energy differences, leading to the frequency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) )= - gamma B \u0127. But wait, when considering the transition frequency, the energy difference is |E_+ - E_-| = gamma B \u0127. So the angular frequency omega would be (E_+ - E_-)/\u0127 = gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, the frequency of oscillation is determined by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant.\n\nThe time evolution of the state leads to oscillations at a frequency given by (E_+ - E_-) / \u0127. So (E_+ - E_-) = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) ) = - gamma B \u0127. The absolute value is gamma B \u0127. So the angular frequency is (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo this again leads me to think the frequency is gamma B, so option B.\n\nBut wait, looking at the answer choices, option B is gamma B. So that's the one.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Did I make a mistake in the initial setup? Let me think. Because the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of H_initial. When the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. So the eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2) and E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, so when the state is expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>, the phases are e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127} and e^{-i E_- t / \u0127}.\n\nSo E_+ is -gamma B \u0127/2, so E_+ t/ \u0127 = (-gamma B t/2) * \u0127 * t? Wait, no, E is in Joules, t in seconds.\n\nWait, E_+ = - gamma B (\u0127/2), so E_+ t / \u0127 = (-gamma B (\u0127/2) ) * t ) / \u0127 = -gamma B t/ 2.\n\nSimilarly, E_- t/ \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127/2) * t / \u0127 = gamma B t / 2.\n\nSo the phases are e^{i gamma B t/2} and e^{-i gamma B t/2}.\n\nWhich when substituted into the state, gives the time evolution as:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y> ] / sqrt(2).\n\nWhich, as we did before, gives <mu_z> oscillating with frequency gamma B.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. When the field is suddenly turned off and reactivated along the $+y$ direction, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian $H = -\\gamma B S_y$.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, I remember from my quantum mechanics class that spin-1/2 particles have magnetic moments. The question says the magnetic moment mu is equal to gamma multiplied by Sz, which makes sense because Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. Right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think.\n\nThe setup is that the particle is initially in a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude B. So, the magnetic field changes direction from Z to Y, and we're supposed to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so the average of the z-component starts oscillating. I'm trying to recall how the spin precesses when the magnetic field changes direction. I think when a magnetic field is applied along a certain axis, the spin will precess around that axis, right? And this precession leads to oscillations in the expectation value of the spin components.\n\nInitially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. So the initial state would probably be an eigenstate of Sz, like spin-up or spin-down. After the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian changes, so the system evolves under a different Hamiltonian.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -mu\u00b7B. Since mu is gamma*S, then H = -gamma * B \u00b7 S. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma * B * S_y. Wait, no, actually, the dot product would be B times the component of S in the direction of B. So if B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but the question says the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. So we need to find \u27e8S_z\u27e9 as a function of time and see its oscillation frequency.\n\nSo, initially, the state is an eigenstate of S_z, let's say |\u2191\u27e9_z. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B S_y. So the system evolves under this new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by the time evolution operator, U = exp(-i H t / \u0127). But since gamma, B, and S are in terms of \u0127 (since S has units of \u0127), maybe we can work it out without worrying about the constants.\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2 for spin-1/2. So H would have eigenvalues \u00b1 gamma B (\u0127/2) multiplied by -1 because H = -gamma B S_y. So the energies are \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127 / 2) * (-1) ? Wait, no, let me think again. H = -gamma B S_y. S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so H has eigenvalues -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the time evolution. The initial state is |\u2191\u27e9_z, which is (1,0) in the Sz basis. The new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so it's off-diagonal in the Sz basis.\n\nThe time evolution of the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U |\u03c8(0)\u27e9, where |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9_z.\n\nTo find \u27e8S_z\u27e9, I can express the state in terms of the energy eigenstates of H. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize H and find the time evolution.\n\nWait, another approach: since the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, the system will undergo precession around the Y-axis. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally with time. The frequency of oscillation is determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates divided by \u0127.\n\nThe energy levels for the Hamiltonian H are E_+ and E_-, so the difference is \u0394E = E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) )= - gamma B \u0127. Wait, no, wait: E_+ = (-gamma B)( \u0127/2 ) (because S_y eigenvalue is +\u0127/2 for |+y\u27e9 and -\u0127/2 for |-y\u27e9). So H|+y\u27e9 = (-gamma B)(\u0127/2) |+y\u27e9. Similarly, H|\u2212y\u27e9 = (-gamma B)(-\u0127/2) |\u2212y\u27e9 = (gamma B \u0127/2) |\u2212y\u27e9. So E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127/2 ), E_- = gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nThe energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127. The oscillation frequency comes from the energy difference over Planck's constant. So the frequency \u03c9 is (E_- - E_+)/\u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B. But wait, that's the angular frequency. So the frequency in terms of cycles per second would be gamma B/(2\u03c0), but the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is \u03c9, the angular frequency.\n\nWait, but the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9_z, which is a superposition of the energy eigenstates of H. Because H is proportional to S_y, and |\u2191\u27e9_z is (|+y\u27e9 + |\u2212y\u27e9)/sqrt(2), I think. Let me verify:\n\nThe eigenstates of S_y are |+y\u27e9 and |\u2212y\u27e9, which can be expressed in terms of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 as:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 + i|\u2193\u27e9)/sqrt(2),\n|\u2212y\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 \u2212 i|\u2193\u27e9)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The spin-up in y-direction is a superposition of spin-up and spin-down in z. Hmm, maybe it's better to represent |\u2191\u27e9_z in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |\u2212y\u27e9.\n\nWait, |\u2191\u27e9_z can be written as (|+y\u27e9 + |\u2212y\u27e9)/sqrt(2). Because when you express the z-basis states in terms of the y-basis, you get combinations. Let me see: the rotation from y to z is a rotation of 90 degrees around x. So |\u2191\u27e9_z = (|+y\u27e9 + |\u2212y\u27e9)/sqrt(2). Because, in terms of spin states, a rotation by 90 degrees about x would take |+y\u27e9 to |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2212y\u27e9 to |\u2193\u27e9, but wait, perhaps I'm getting the phase wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (|+y\u27e9 + |\u2212y\u27e9)/sqrt(2) for |\u2191\u27e9_z.\n\nIf that's the case, then the initial state |\u2191\u27e9_z is a superposition of the energy eigenstates |+y\u27e9 and |\u2212y\u27e9 with equal amplitude. So the time evolution under H would cause each component to pick up a phase factor. Let's see:\n\nThe initial state is |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |\u2212y\u27e9)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe time evolution is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e^(-i H t / \u0127) |\u03c8(0)\u27e9.\n\nSince H |+y\u27e9 = E_+ |+y\u27e9 and H |\u2212y\u27e9 = E_- |\u2212y\u27e9, each term will evolve with their respective phases.\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i E_- t / \u0127} |\u2212y\u27e9 ) / sqrt(2).\n\nSubstituting E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127/2 ), E_- = (gamma B \u0127/2):\n\ne^{-i E_+ t / \u0127} = e^{i (gamma B t / 2 )},\ne^{-i E_- t / \u0127} = e^{-i (gamma B t / 2 )}.\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ e^{i (gamma B t / 2)} |+y\u27e9 + e^{ -i (gamma B t / 2)} |\u2212y\u27e9 ] / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, we need to compute \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the expectation value of S_z in terms of the time evolution. Since the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9_z, which is |+y\u27e9 + |\u2212y\u27e9 over sqrt(2), and under H, each term acquires a phase.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the time derivative of the expectation value and solve the differential equation.\n\nAlternatively, since the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y, the time evolution of S_z can be found using the Heisenberg picture.\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the operator S_z(t) is given by:\n\nS_z(t) = e^{i H t / \u0127} S_z e^{-i H t / \u0127}.\n\nWe can compute this using the commutator [H, S_z].\n\nBut H is proportional to S_y, so [H, S_z] = -gamma B [S_y, S_z].\n\nWe know that [S_y, S_z] = i \u0127 S_x.\n\nSo,\n\nd(S_z(t))/dt = (i/\u0127) [H, S_z(t)].\n\nWait, in Heisenberg equation of motion,\n\ndO_H/dt = (i/\u0127) [H, O_H] + (dO_S/dt),\n\nbut since S_z is time-independent in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, the second term is zero.\n\nSo,\n\nd(S_z(t))/dt = (i/\u0127) [H, S_z(t)].\n\nBut H = - gamma B S_y,\n\nSo,\n\n[H, S_z] = -gamma B [S_y, S_z] = -gamma B (i \u0127 S_x )\n\nSo,\n\nd(S_z)/dt = (i/\u0127) (-gamma B i \u0127 S_x )\n\nSimplify this:\n\ni * (- gamma B i \u0127 S_x ) / \u0127 = (i^2)(gamma B \u0127 S_x ) / \u0127 )= (-1) (gamma B S_x )\n\nSo,\n\nd(S_z)/dt = - gamma B S_x.\n\nSimilarly, we can find d(S_x)/dt.\n\n[H, S_x] = -gamma B [S_y, S_x] = -gamma B (-i \u0127 S_z )\n\nSo,\n\nd(S_x)/dt = (i/\u0127) [H, S_x] = (i/\u0127) (-gamma B (-i \u0127 S_z )) )\n\n= (i * gamma B i \u0127 S_z ) / \u0127 )\n\ni^2 = -1,\n\n= (- gamma B S_z )\n\nSo,\n\nd(S_x)/dt = - gamma B S_z.\n\nAnd for S_y,\n\n[H, S_y] = [ -gamma B S_y, S_y ] = 0,\n\nso d(S_y)/dt = 0. So S_y is constant in Heisenberg picture.\n\nNow, we can write a system of differential equations:\n\nd(S_z)/dt = - gamma B S_x,\n\nd(S_x)/dt = - gamma B S_z,\n\nd(S_y)/dt = 0.\n\nThis is a coupled system. Let me write them as:\n\nd^2(S_z)/dt^2 = d/dt [ - gamma B S_x ] = - gamma B (d S_x/dt ) = - gamma B ( - gamma B S_z ) = gamma^2 B^2 S_z.\n\nSo,\n\nd^2(S_z)/dt^2 = gamma^2 B^2 S_z.\n\nThe solution to this differential equation is S_z(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t).\n\nBut wait, the general solution for d\u00b2y/dt\u00b2 = \u03c9\u00b2 y is y(t) = y_0 cos(\u03c9 t) + (y_0')/\u03c9 sin(\u03c9 t).\n\nBut the initial conditions are at t=0, S_z(0) = S_z_initial, which is the expectation value of S_z at t=0. Since the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9_z, the expectation value is (\u0127/2) (since spin-1/2 has S_z = \u00b1 \u0127/2).\n\nSo S_z(0) = \u0127/2.\n\nThe derivative at t=0: d(S_z)/dt (0) = - gamma B S_x(0). But S_x(0) is the expectation value of S_x in the initial state |\u2191\u27e9_z. The expectation value of S_x in |\u2191\u27e9_z is zero, because |\u2191\u27e9_z is an eigenstate of S_z and S_x has expectation zero in that state. So d(S_z)/dt at t=0 is zero.\n\nSo the solution is S_z(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the initial conditions.\n\nAt t=0, S_z(0) = (\u0127/2) cos(0) = \u0127/2. Correct.\n\nd(S_z)/dt = - (gamma B)(\u0127/2) sin(gamma B t). At t=0, it's zero. Correct.\n\nSo \u27e8S_z(t)\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * S_z. So the average of mu_z would be gamma * \u27e8S_z\u27e9.\n\nBut the question is about the average of the z-component of the moment, so that's mu_z = gamma S_z. So \u27e8mu_z\u27e9 = gamma \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = gamma (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nThe oscillation frequency of \u27e8mu_z\u27e9 is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, the question says the average of the z-component starts oscillating. So the frequency is gamma B. So the answer would be B) gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, in the Heisenberg approach, I found that the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the options are:\n\nA) gamma B /2\n\nB) gamma B\n\nC) sqrt(2) gamma B\n\nD) gamma B / sqrt(2)\n\nSo the correct answer should be B) gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when the particle is initially in a state that's a superposition of energy eigenstates, the time evolution leads to oscillations in the expectation value. The energy difference between the states is E_+ - E_- = (gamma B \u0127/2) - (- gamma B \u0127/2 ) ) = gamma B \u0127. So the frequency is (E_+ - E_- ) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, we analyze the system as follows:\n\nThe particle is a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the +Z direction.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, I remember from my quantum mechanics class that spin-1/2 particles have magnetic moments. The question says the magnetic moment mu is equal to gamma multiplied by Sz, which makes sense because Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. Right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think.\n\nThe setup is that the particle is initially in a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude B. So, the magnetic field changes direction from Z to Y, and we're supposed to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so the average of the z-component starts oscillating. I'm trying to recall how the spin precesses when the magnetic field changes direction. I think when a magnetic field is applied along a certain axis, the spin will precess around that axis, right? And this precession leads to oscillations in the expectation value of the spin components.\n\nInitially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. So the initial state would probably be an eigenstate of Sz, like spin-up or spin-down. After the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian changes, so the system evolves under a different Hamiltonian.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -mu\u00b7B. Since mu is gamma*S, then H = -gamma * B \u00b7 S. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma * B * S_y. Wait, no, actually, the dot product would be B times the component of S in the direction of B. So if B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but the question says the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. So we need to find \u27e8S_z\u27e9 as a function of time and see its oscillation frequency.\n\nSo, initially, the state is an eigenstate of S_z, let's say |\u2191\u27e9_z. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B S_y. So the system evolves under this new Hamiltonian.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by the time evolution operator, U = exp(-i H t / \u0127). But since gamma, B, and S are in terms of \u0127 (since S has units of \u0127), maybe we can work it out without worrying about the constants.\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2 for spin-1/2. So H would have eigenvalues \u00b1 gamma B (\u0127/2) multiplied by -1 because H = -gamma B S_y. So the energies are \u00b1 (gamma B \u0127 / 2) * (-1) ? Wait, no, let me think again. H = -gamma B S_y. S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so H has eigenvalues -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the time evolution. The initial state is |\u2191\u27e9_z, which is (1,0) in the Sz basis. The new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so it's off-diagonal in the Sz basis.\n\nThe time evolution of the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U |\u03c8(0)\u27e9, where |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9_z.\n\nTo find \u27e8S_z\u27e9, I can express the state in terms of the energy eigenstates of H. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize H and find the time evolution.\n\nWait, another approach: since the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, the system will undergo precession around the Y-axis. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally with time. The frequency of oscillation is determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates divided by \u0127.\n\nThe energy levels for the Hamiltonian H are E_+ and E_-, so the difference is \u0394E = E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) )= - gamma B \u0127. Wait, no, wait: E_+ = (-gamma B)( \u0127/2 ) (because S_y eigenvalue is +\u0127/2 for |+y\u27e9 and -\u0127/2 for |-y\u27e9). So H|+y\u27e9 = (-gamma B)(\u0127/2) |+y\u27e9. Similarly, H|\u2212y\u27e9 = (-gamma B)(-\u0127/2) |\u2212y\u27e9 = (gamma B \u0127/2) |\u2212y\u27e9. So E_+ = - (gamma B \u0127/2 ), E_- = gamma B \u0127/2.\n\nThe energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B \u0127. The oscillation frequency comes from the energy difference over Planck's constant. So the frequency \u03c9 is (E_- - E_+)/\u0127 = (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 = gamma B. But wait, that's the angular frequency. So the frequency in terms of cycles per second would be gamma B/(2\u03c0), but the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is \u03c9, the angular frequency.\n\nWait, but the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9_z, which is a superposition of the energy eigenstates of H. Because H is proportional to S_y, and |\u2191\u27e9_z is (|+y\u27e9 + |\u2212y\u27e9)/sqrt(2), I think.

Let me think again. The spin-up in y-direction is a superposition of spin-up and spin-down in z. Hmm, maybe it's better to represent |\u2191\u27e9_z in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |\u2212y\u27e9.\n\nWait, |\u2191\u27e9_z can be written as (|+y\u27e9 + |\u2212y\u27e9)/sqrt(2). Because when you express the z-basis states in terms of the y-basis, you get combinations. Let me see: the rotation from y to z is a rotation of 90 degrees around x. So |\u2191\u27e9_z = (|+y\u27e9 + |\u2212y\u27e9)/sqrt(2). Because, in terms of spin states, a rotation by 90 degrees about x would take |+y\u27e9 to |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2212y\u27e9 to |\u2193\u27e9, but wait, perhaps I'm getting the phase wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (|+y\u27e9 + |\u2212y\u27e9)/sqrt(2) for |\u2191\u27e9_z.\n\nIf that's the case, then the initial state |\u2191\u27e9_z is a superposition of the energy eigenstates |+y\u27e9 and |\u2212y\u27e9 with equal amplitude.

So S_y is constant in Heisenberg picture.\n\nNow, we can write a system of differential equations:\n\nd(S_z)/dt = - gamma B S_x,\n\nd(S_x)/dt = - gamma B S_z,\n\nd(S_y)/dt = 0.\n\nThis is a coupled system. Let me write them as:\n\nd^2(S_z)/dt^2 = d/dt [ - gamma B S_x ] = - gamma B (d S_x/dt ) = - gamma B ( - gamma B S_z ) = gamma^2 B^2 S_z.\n\nSo,\n\nd^2(S_z)/dt^2 = gamma^2 B^2 S_z.\n\nThe solution to this differential equation is S_z(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t).\n\nBut wait, the general solution for d\u00b2y/dt\u00b2 = \u03c9\u00b2 y is y(t) = y_0 cos(\u03c9 t) + (y_0')/\u03c9 sin(\u03c9 t).\n\nBut the initial conditions are at t=0, S_z(0) = S_z_initial, which is the expectation value of S_z at t=0. Since the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9_z, the expectation value is (\u0127/2) (since spin-1/2 has S_z = \u00b1 \u0127/2).\n\nSo S_z(0) = \u0127/2.\n\nThe derivative at t=0: d(S_z)/dt (0) = - gamma B S_x(0). But S_x(0) is the expectation value of S_x in the initial state |\u2191\u27e9_z. The expectation value of S_x in |\u2191\u27e9_z is zero, because |\u2191\u27e9_z is an eigenstate of S_z and S_x has expectation zero in that state. So d(S_z)/dt at t=0 is zero.\n\nSo the solution is S_z(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the initial conditions.\n\nAt t=0, S_z(0) = (\u0127/2) cos(0) = \u0127/2. Correct.\n\nd(S_z)/dt = - (gamma B)(\u0127/2) sin(gamma B t). At t=0, it's zero. Correct.\n\nSo \u27e8S_z(t)\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * S_z. So the average of mu_z would be gamma * \u27e8S_z\u27e9.\n\nBut the question is about the average of the z-component of the moment, so that's mu_z = gamma S_z. So \u27e8mu_z\u27e9 = gamma \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = gamma (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\nThe oscillation frequency of \u27e8mu_z\u27e9 is gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, the question says the average of the z-component starts oscillating. So the frequency is gamma B. So the answer would be B) gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait, in the Heisenberg approach, I found that the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the options are:\n\nA) gamma B /2\n\nB) gamma B\n\nC) sqrt(2) gamma B\n\nD) gamma B / sqrt(2)\n\nSo the correct answer should be B) gamma B.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when the particle is initially in a state that's a superposition of energy eigenstates, the time evolution leads to oscillations in the expectation value. The energy difference between the states is E_+ - E_- = (gamma B \u0127/2) - (- gamma B \u0127/2 ) ) = gamma B \u0127. So the frequency is (E_+ - E_- ) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, we analyze the system as follows:\n\nThe particle is a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the +Z direction. The field is then switched to the +Y direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The Hamiltonian for the system is given by:\n\n\\[\nH = -\\mu \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = -\\gamma B S_y,\n\\]\n\nwhere $S_y$ is the spin operator in the y-direction. The eigenvalues of $S_y$ are $\\pm \\hbar/2$, so the energy eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are:\n\n\\[\nE_+ = -\\gamma B \\frac{\\hbar}{2}, \\quad E_- = \\gamma B \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe energy difference between the two eigenstates is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = E_- - E_+ = \\gamma B \\hbar.\n\\]\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle$, is determined by the energy difference divided by $\\hbar$:\n\n\\[\n\\omega = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\hbar} = \\gamma B.\n\\]\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **A) $\\gamma B / 2$**: Incorrect. This would correspond to a frequency half of the correct value.\n- **B) $\\gamma B$**: Correct. This matches the derived oscillation frequency.\n- **C) $\\sqrt{2} \\gamma B$**: Incorrect. This is inconsistent with the energy difference calculation.\n- **D) $\\gamma B / \\sqrt{2}$**: Incorrect. This is unrelated to the energy difference or the derived frequency.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.\n\nThe problem says the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The magnetic moment would align with the field because that's the lowest energy state.\n\nThen the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So the initial state was aligned along Z, and then suddenly the field changes direction to Y. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, right? Initially, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -mu\u00b7B, which in the z-direction. After the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu\u00b7B' where B' is along Y. But since mu is proportional to Sz, that's along Z. Hmm, so the new Hamiltonian would involve Sx and Sy maybe?\n\nWait, no, wait. The magnetic moment mu is gamma Sz, so when the field is along Y, the interaction would be proportional to Sy. So the Hamiltonian becomes H = gamma B Sy, or perhaps H = -gamma B Sy. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the interaction energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, then H = -mu \u00b7 B = -gamma B Sy.\n\nBut wait, the spin-1/2 system's Hamiltonian in a magnetic field along a direction n is H = -gamma B S\u00b7n. So in this case, n is along Y, so H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but spin matrices: for spin-1/2, Sx, Sy, Sz have specific forms. Sy is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix sigma_y. But in terms of the units, I think gamma would have units such that gamma * S gives the magnetic moment, which has units of J/T (joules per tesla), I think.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B Sy would be the energies. The eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b1 \u0127/2 times something? Let me recall. For spin-1/2, Sy has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the eigenvalues of H would be -gamma B multiplied by (\u00b1 \u0127/2), which gives \u00b1 (-gamma B \u0127/2). Wait, no, wait. H is proportional to Sy, so H = -gamma B Sy. So the eigenvalues are -gamma B multiplied by the eigenvalues of Sy, which are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So that's (-gamma B)(\u00b1 \u0127/2) \u2192 \u00b1 (-gamma B \u0127/2). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is written as H = gamma B Sy (without the negative sign?), but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the interaction energy is U = -mu \u00b7 B. So mu is gamma S, so U = -gamma S \u00b7 B. So when B is along Y, U = -gamma B S_y. So the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. So the energy levels are E = \u00b1 (-gamma B) (\u0127/2). Because S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = +gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, that would make the energy difference between the two states E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) )= -gamma B \u0127. Hmm, but when the magnetic field is suddenly changed, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe initial state is when the field was along Z, and the system was in an eigenstate of H_initial. Let's say the initial state is |+z>, which is the eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Because when the field is along Z, the system aligns with it, so it's in the state |+z>.\n\nAfter the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. So the initial state |+z> is not an eigenstate of H. So the state will evolve under H. The expectation value of Sz (the z-component of the magnetic moment) will oscillate because the state is a superposition of energy eigenstates.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The state at time t will be a combination of the eigenstates of H, each multiplied by a phase factor. The oscillations in expectation values come from interference between these phases.\n\nThe energy eigenstates for H are |+y> and |-y>, the eigenstates of S_y. The initial state |+z> can be expressed as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nLet me recall the relation between |+z>, |+y>, etc. The |+y> state is (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2), but wait, no, that's for spin in the x-direction. Alternatively, perhaps the states |+y> and |-y> can be written in terms of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nI think the eigenstates of S_y are (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) and (|+z> - |-z>)/(i sqrt(2)), but I'm not sure. Let me think: The eigenstates of S_y are such that S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y> and similarly for |-y>.\n\nExpressed in the Z basis, these would be superpositions. Let me write them:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/(i sqrt(2))\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check. The Pauli matrices for Sy are (i\u0127/2) times [[0, -1], [1, 0]] or something like that. The eigenstates for Sy can be found by solving (Sy - (\u0127/2) I) |v> = 0. Let me compute Sy.\n\nSy = (\u0127/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation for Sy is Sy |v> = (\u0127/2) sigma |v> where sigma is \u00b11.\n\nSo for eigenvalue (\u0127/2), we have:\n\n(0 -i; i 0) |v> = (1) |v>\nWhich implies the equations:\n- i v2 = v1\ni v1 = v2\n\nFrom the first equation: v1 = -i v2. Substituting into the second equation: i (-i v2) = v2 \u2192 (i*(-i)) v2 = v2 \u2192 (1) v2 = v2. So v2 can be any value. Let's choose v2 = 1, so v1 = -i. So the eigenvector is [-i, 1]^T. To make it a unit vector, divide by sqrt( ( (-i)(-i) ) + (1)(1) ) = sqrt( (-1) +1 ) = sqrt(0) \u2192 wait, that can't be right. Wait, |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = | -i |^2 + |1|^2 = 1 + 1 = 2. So the normalized vector is [ -i / sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but that's in the basis of |+z> and |-z>. So |+y> is (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2). Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of real and imaginary components. Alternatively, maybe I can express |+y> as (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) multiplied by a phase factor.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that the initial state |+z> can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y>. Let's write:\n\n|+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>\n\nWe can find a and b by expanding in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the time evolution of the expectation value <Sz> as a function of time.\n\nThe system is in state |+z> at t=0. The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. The time evolution is given by the time evolution operator U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ).\n\nThe expectation value of Sz at time t is <Sz(t)> = <\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)>, where |\u03c8(t)> = U(t) |+z>.\n\nBut perhaps using the time-dependent perturbation theory or transition probabilities is more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the energy eigenbasis approach.\n\nSince the initial state |+z> can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of H, which are |+y> and |-y>, the time evolution will cause each component to acquire a phase factor. The expectation value will then involve terms oscillating at the frequency determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates.\n\nLet me denote the eigenstates of H as |E+> and |E->, with energies E+ and E-.\n\nSo |E+> is |+y>, and |E-> is |-y>.\n\nThe initial state |+z> can be written as:\n\n|+z> = c_+ |E+> + c_- |E->\n\nThe coefficients c_+ and c_- can be found by expressing |+z> in terms of |E+> and |E->.\n\nWait, but I think I need to find the expansion coefficients. Let me think about the basis. Let me write |+y> as (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2). Wait, perhaps earlier calculation was off. Let me correct that.\n\nThe eigenvalue equation for H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, H = -gamma B (Sy), but Sy is (\u0127/2) sigma_y. So H = -gamma B (\u0127/2) sigma_y.\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of H would be -gamma B (\u0127/2) times the eigenvalues of sigma_y, which are \u00b11. So E_+ = (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) * 1 = -gamma B \u0127 / 2, and E_- = (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) * (-1) )= gamma B \u0127 / 2.\n\nSo the energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2) - (-gamma B \u0127/2) )= gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is |\u03c8(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127 ) |+z>.\n\nExpressed in terms of |E+> and |E->, this becomes:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = c_+ exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) |E+> + c_- exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) |E->\n\nThe expectation value of Sz is:\n\n<Sz(t)> = <\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)>\n\nWhich expands into terms involving c_+^* c_+ <E+| Sz |E+>, c_+^* c_- <E+| Sz |E-> exp(i (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 ), and c_-^* c_- <E-| Sz |E->, plus the complex conjugate terms.\n\nBut wait, for spin-1/2, the Sz operator has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 for |+z> and |-z>.\n\nBut what are the matrix elements of Sz between |E+> and |E->? Let me think. Since |E+> and |E-> are eigenstates of Sy, which doesn't commute with Sz.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute <E+| Sz |E->. Let me express |E+> and |E-> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\nEarlier, we saw that |E+> = |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2)\nAnd |E-> = |-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo, let me compute <E+| Sz |E->.\n\nFirst, Sz |E+> = (\u0127/2) |+z> ?\n\nWait, no. Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. So Sz |+z> = (\u0127/2)|+z>, and Sz |-z> = (-\u0127/2)|-z>.\n\nSo, applying Sz to |E+>:\n\nSz |E+> = Sz [ (|+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n= ( Sz |+z> + i Sz |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + i (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ |+z> - i |-z> ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ (|+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n= (\u0127/2) |E-> ?\n\nWait, because |E-> is (|+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2). So, yes, Sz |E+> = (\u0127/2) |E->.\n\nSimilarly, Sz |E-> = (\u0127/2) |E+> ?\n\nLet me check: Sz |E-> = Sz [ (|+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n= ( Sz |+z> - i Sz |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> - i (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ |+z> + i |-z> ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) |E+>\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, now, <E+| Sz |E+> = <E+| (\u0127/2) |E+> = (\u0127/2) <E+|E+> = \u0127/2.\n\nSimilarly, <E-| Sz |E-> = \u0127/2.\n\nBut what about the cross terms <E+| Sz |E->?\n\nFrom above, Sz |E+> = (\u0127/2) |E->, so <E+| Sz |E-> = (\u0127/2) <E+|E-> = 0, since |E+> and |E-> are orthogonal.\n\nSo the expectation value <Sz(t)> becomes:\n\n= |c_+|^2 (\u0127/2) + |c_-|^2 (\u0127/2) + c_+ c_-^* exp( i (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 ) (0) + c_- c_+^* exp( -i (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 ) (0)\nWait, that can't be right. Because I think I might have made a mistake in the cross terms.\n\nWait, no, the cross terms are c_+^* c_- <E+| Sz |E-> exp( i (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 )\n\nBut since <E+| Sz |E-> is zero, those terms are zero.\n\nWait, but that would imply that <Sz(t)> is just |c_+|^2 (\u0127/2) + |c_-|^2 (\u0127/2).\n\nBut that can't be the case because the state |+z> is a combination of |E+> and |E->, and when the state evolves, the expectation value should oscillate.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the expansion should be:\n\n<Sz(t)> = |c_+|^2 (\u0127/2) + |c_-|^2 (-\u0127/2) + c_+ c_-^* exp( i (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 ) <E+| Sz |E-> + c_- c_+^* exp( -i (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 ) <E-| Sz |E+>\n\nWait, but I thought that <E+| Sz |E-> is zero. But let me recompute.\n\nWait, Sz |E+> = (\u0127/2) |E->, so <E+| Sz |E-> = (\u0127/2) <E+| E-> ) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, <E-| Sz |E+> = (\u0127/2) <E-| E+> ) = 0.\n\nSo the cross terms are zero. Therefore, <Sz(t)> is |c_+|^2 (\u0127/2) + |c_-|^2 (-\u0127/2).\n\nWait, but that would mean the expectation value is time-independent, which contradicts the problem statement that says it starts oscillating.\n\nHmm, that must mean I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not expand the Hamiltonian in terms of its eigenstates but use a different approach. Let's think about the time evolution of the expectation value.\n\nThe initial state is |+z>. The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nThe time evolution is given by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, so the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)> = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ) |+z>.\n\nThe expectation value of Sz is <Sz(t)> = <\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)>\n\nWe can compute this using the time-evolved state. Alternatively, perhaps using the Heisenberg picture would be easier, where the operator evolves with the Hamiltonian.\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the operator Sz(t) is given by:\n\nSz(t) = exp( i H t / \u0127 ) Sz exp( -i H t / \u0127 )\n\nThe expectation value is <Sz(t)> = <+z| Sz(t) |+z>\n\nSo, we can compute d<Sz>/dt and find the frequency of oscillation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the time evolution of the expectation value is given by the Ehrenfest theorem, which says that d<S>/dt = (1/i\u0127) < [S, H] >.\n\nSo, let me compute d<Sz>/dt.\n\nd<Sz>/dt = (1/i\u0127) < [Sz, H] >.\n\nH is proportional to Sy. So [Sz, H] = [Sz, -gamma B Sy ] = -gamma B [Sz, Sy].\n\nWe know that [Sz, Sy] = i\u0127 Sz, because [S_i, S_j] = i \u0127 \u03b5_{ijk} S_k.\n\nSo [Sz, Sy] = i \u0127 Sx.\n\nWait, let me think: the commutator [Sz, Sy] = i \u0127 Sx.\n\nSo, [Sz, H] = -gamma B [Sz, Sy] = -gamma B (i \u0127 Sx) = -i gamma B \u0127 Sx.\n\nThus, d<Sz>/dt = (1/(i\u0127)) < -i gamma B \u0127 Sx > = (1/(i\u0127)) ( -i gamma B \u0127 <Sx> ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe i's cancel: (1/(i\u0127)) * (-i) = ( -i ) / (i\u0127) ) = (-i)/(i \u0127) )= (-1)/\u0127 * (i/i) )= (-1)/\u0127 *1? Wait, no, because (-i)/(i) )= - (i^2)/(i^2) )= - ( (-1) ) / ( (-1) ) )= 1? Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.\n\n(-i)/(i) = (-i)(1/i) )= (-i)(-i) )= (i^2) )= -1.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, 1/i = -i, because i * (-i) = 1.\n\nSo, (-i) / i = (-i) * (1/i) )= (-i)(-i) )= i^2 = -1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nd<Sz>/dt = (1/(i\u0127)) * ( -i gamma B \u0127 <Sx> ) )\n\n= (1/(i\u0127)) * ( -i gamma B \u0127 <Sx> )\n\n= (1/(i\u0127)) * ( -i gamma B \u0127 ) <Sx>\n\n= (1/(i\u0127)) * (-i gamma B \u0127 ) <Sx>\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe i's: (1/i) * (-i) )= (1/i) * (-i) )= - (i^2) )= - (-1) )= 1.\n\nThe \u0127 terms: \u0127 / \u0127 = 1.\n\nSo d<Sz>/dt = gamma B <Sx>.\n\nHmm, that's an equation: d<Sz>/dt = gamma B <Sx>.\n\nBut we need another equation to relate d<Sx>/dt.\n\nAgain, using Ehrenfest:\n\nd<Sx>/dt = (1/i\u0127) < [Sx, H] >.\n\nH is -gamma B Sy, so [Sx, H] = -gamma B [Sx, Sy].\n\nWe know that [Sx, Sy] = i \u0127 Sz.\n\nSo [Sx, H] = -gamma B (i \u0127 Sz ) = -i gamma B \u0127 Sz.\n\nThus,\n\nd<Sx>/dt = (1/(i \u0127)) < [Sx, H] > = (1/(i \u0127)) ( -i gamma B \u0127 <Sz> ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/(i \u0127)) * (-i gamma B \u0127 ) <Sz> )\n\n= (1/(i \u0127)) * (-i gamma B \u0127 ) <Sz>\n\n= ( -i gamma B <Sz> ) / i )\n\nBecause (1/(i \u0127)) * (-i gamma B \u0127 ) = ( (-i gamma B ) / i ) ) * ( \u0127 / \u0127 ) )= ( (-i gamma B ) / i ) ) *1.\n\nSo, (-i)/i = (-i^2)/i^2 * i^2? Wait, perhaps better to compute it as:\n\n(-i)/(i) )= (-i)(1/i) )= (-i)(-i) )= i^2 = -1.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, 1/i = -i, so (-i) * (1/i) )= (-i)(-i) )= i^2 = -1.\n\nSo,\n\nd<Sx>/dt = (-i gamma B ) / i ) * <Sz>\n\n= ( -i / i ) * gamma B <Sz>\n\n= (-i^2) gamma B <Sz> = (1) gamma B <Sz>\n\nSo,\n\nd<Sx>/dt = gamma B <Sz>\n\nSo now we have two coupled differential equations:\n\nd<Sz>/dt = gamma B <Sx>\nd<Sx>/dt = gamma B <Sz>\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Let me write them as:\n\nd<Sz>/dt = gamma B Sx\nd<Sx>/dt = gamma B Sz\n\nThis is a system of ODEs that can be solved.\n\nLet me let a(t) = <Sz>, and b(t) = <Sx>.\n\nThen,\n\nda/dt = gamma B b\ndb/dt = gamma B a\n\nThis is a system of linear ODEs. To solve this, perhaps I can take the derivative of a twice.\n\nDifferentiating da/dt:\n\nd\u00b2a/dt\u00b2 = gamma B db/dt = gamma B (gamma B a) )= (gamma B)^2 a\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2a/dt\u00b2 = (gamma B)^2 a\n\nThe general solution to this is a(t) = A cos( gamma B t ) + B sin( gamma B t )\n\nSimilarly, since db/dt = gamma B a, the solution for b(t) would involve the same frequencies.\n\nBut wait, in the initial condition, at t=0, what are a(0) and b(0)?\n\nAt t=0, the state is |+z>, so <Sz> = (gamma \u0127/2) (since mu = gamma Sz, but wait, Sz has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So <Sz> = (gamma) * (\u0127/2). Wait, no, mu is gamma Sz, so <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z>, so <Sz> = \u0127/2.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz. So <mu_z> = gamma <Sz> = gamma (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, but in our variables, a(t) is <Sz>, so a(0) = <Sz> = \u0127/2.\n\nSimilarly, <Sx> at t=0: in the state |+z>, <Sx> is zero because |+z> is an eigenstate of Sz, so the expectation value of Sx is zero.\n\nSo, initial conditions:\n\na(0) = \u0127/2\nb(0) = 0\n\nSo, applying to a(t):\n\na(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t )\n\nAt t=0:\n\na(0) = A = \u0127/2\n\nSo, A = \u0127/2.\n\nNow, the derivative of a(t) is:\n\nda/dt = - (gamma B) ( \u0127/2 ) sin(gamma B t) + B gamma B cos(gamma B t )\n\nAt t=0, da/dt = B (gamma B) * 1 = B gamma B.\n\nBut from da/dt = gamma B b(t), and at t=0, b(0)=0. So:\n\nda/dt at t=0 is 0.\n\nSo,\n\n0 = - (gamma B)( \u0127/2 ) * 0 + B (gamma B) * 1 \u2192 0 + B gamma B = 0 \u2192 B gamma B = 0 \u2192 B =0.\n\nSo, B =0.\n\nThus, a(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nSimilarly, since db/dt = gamma B a(t), integrating:\n\nb(t) = (gamma B) \u222b a(t) dt + C\n\nBut from initial conditions, b(0)=0, so C=0.\n\nSo,\n\nb(t) = (gamma B) \u222b (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t) dt\n= (gamma B) * (\u0127/(2 gamma B)) ) sin(gamma B t )\n= (\u0127/2) sin(gamma B t )\n\nThus,\n\n<Sz(t)> = a(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nWait, but wait: the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz, so the z-component of the magnetic moment is mu_z = gamma <Sz>.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z (t) > = gamma <Sz(t)> = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos(gamma B t )\n\nThe average of the z-component oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nWait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So the frequency is gamma B. Looking at the options, option B is gamma B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes the actual frequency is different.\n\nWait, the equation says cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency omega is gamma B. The frequency f is omega/(2 pi) ), but the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is omega. So the answer would be gamma B, which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait, another approach: when the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy, the energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2 ), E_- = (-gamma B \u0127/2 )\n\nThe energy difference is E_+ - E_- = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe time period for oscillations in expectation values would be T = 2 pi / omega, where omega is the angular frequency, which is (E_+ - E_- ) / \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127 ) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the angular frequency is gamma B, so the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the average oscillates with frequency gamma B, which matches option B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched to point along the $+y$ direction, and the task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  \n   Initially, the particle is in the state $|+z\\rangle$, an eigenstate of $S_z$. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. This Hamiltonian is proportional to $S_y$, which does not commute with $S_z$, so the initial state is no longer an eigenstate of $H$.\n\n2. **Time Evolution**:  \n   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The state at time $t$ evolves as $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar}|+z\\rangle$. The expectation value of $S_z$ oscillates due to the interference between energy eigenstates of $H$.\n\n3. **Coupled Differential Equations**:  \n   Using Ehrenfest's theorem, the time derivatives of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle S_x \\rangle$ are found to satisfy the coupled equations:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\langle S_z \\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma B \\langle S_x \\rangle, \\quad \\frac{d\\langle S_x \\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma B \\langle S_z \\rangle.\n   \\]\n   These equations describe oscillations between $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle S_x \\rangle$ with a frequency determined by $\\gamma B$.\n\n4. **Solution for $\\langle S_z \\rangle$**:  \n   Solving the coupled equations yields:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle(t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   The oscillation of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ occurs with angular frequency $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n5. **Magnetic Moment Oscillation**:  \n   Since the magnetic moment is $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, the $z$-component of the magnetic moment oscillates as:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle(t) = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle(t) = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   The oscillation frequency of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ is therefore $\\gamma B$.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.\n\nThe problem says the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The magnetic moment would align with the field because that's the lowest energy state.\n\nThen the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So the initial state was aligned along Z, and then suddenly the field changes direction to Y. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, so when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, right? Initially, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -mu\u00b7B, which in the z-direction. After the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu\u00b7B' where B' is along Y. But since mu is proportional to Sz, that's along Z. Hmm, so the new Hamiltonian would involve Sx and Sy maybe?\n\nWait, no, wait. The magnetic moment mu is gamma Sz, so when the field is along Y, the interaction would be proportional to Sy. So the Hamiltonian becomes H = gamma B Sy, or perhaps H = -gamma B Sy. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the interaction energy is -mu \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, then H = -mu \u00b7 B = -gamma B Sy.\n\nBut wait, the spin-1/2 system's Hamiltonian in a magnetic field along a direction n is H = -gamma B S\u00b7n. So in this case, n is along Y, so H = -gamma B Sy.\n\nWait, but spin matrices: for spin-1/2, Sx, Sy, Sz have specific forms. Sy is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix sigma_y. But in terms of the units, I think gamma would have units such that gamma * S gives the magnetic moment, which has units of J/T (joules per tesla), I think.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B Sy would be the energies. The eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b1 \u0127/2 times something? Let me recall. For spin-1/2, Sy has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So the eigenvalues of H would be -gamma B multiplied by (\u00b1 \u0127/2), which gives \u00b1 (-gamma B \u0127/2). Wait, no, wait. H is proportional to Sy, so H = -gamma B Sy. So the eigenvalues are -gamma B multiplied by the eigenvalues of Sy, which are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So that's (-gamma B)(\u00b1 \u0127/2) \u2192 \u00b1 (-gamma B \u0127/2). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is written as H = gamma B Sy (without the negative sign?), but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the interaction energy is U = -mu \u00b7 B. So mu is gamma S, so U = -gamma S \u00b7 B. So when B is along Y, U = -gamma B S_y. So the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. So the energy levels are E = \u00b1 (-gamma B) (\u0127/2). Because S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2), E_- = +gamma B (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, that would make the energy difference between the two states E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B \u0127/2) - (gamma B \u0127/2) )= -gamma B \u0127. Hmm, but when the magnetic field is suddenly changed, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nThe initial state is when the field was along Z, and the system was in an eigenstate of H_initial. Let's say the initial state is |+z>, which is the eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Because when the field is along Z, the system aligns with it, so it's in the state |+z>.\n\nAfter the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. So the initial state |+z> is not an eigenstate of H. So the state will evolve under H. The expectation value of Sz (the z-component of the magnetic moment) will oscillate because the state is a superposition of energy eigenstates.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The state at time t will be a combination of the eigenstates of H, each multiplied by a phase factor. The oscillations in expectation values come from interference between these phases.\n\nThe energy eigenstates for H are |+y> and |-y>, the eigenstates of S_y. The initial state |+z> can be expressed as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nLet me recall the relation between |+z>, |+y>, etc. The |+y> state is (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2), but wait, no, that's for spin in the x-direction. Alternatively, perhaps the states |+y> and |-y> can be written in terms of |+z> and |-z>.\n\nI think the eigenstates of S_y are (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) and (|+z> - |-z>)/(i sqrt(2)), but I'm not sure. Let me think: The eigenstates of S_y are such that S_y |+y> = (\u0127/2) |+y> and similarly for |-y>.\n\nExpressed in the Z basis, these would be superpositions. Let me write them:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/(i sqrt(2))\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check. The Pauli matrices for Sy are (i\u0127/2) times [[0, -1], [1, 0]] or something like that. The eigenstates for Sy can be found by solving (Sy - (\u0127/2) I) |v> = 0. Let me compute Sy.\n\nSy = (\u0127/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation for Sy is Sy |v> = (\u0127/2) sigma |v> where sigma is \u00b11.\n\nSo for eigenvalue (\u0127/2), we have:\n\n(0 -i; i 0) |v> = (1) |v>\nWhich implies the equations:\n- i v2 = v1\ni v1 = v2\n\nFrom the first equation: v1 = -i v2. Substituting into the second equation: i (-i v2) = v2 \u2192 (i*(-i)) v2 = v2 \u2192 (1) v2 = v2. So v2 can be any value. Let's choose v2 = 1, so v1 = -i. So the eigenvector is [-i, 1]^T. To make it a unit vector, divide by sqrt( ( (-i)(-i) ) + (1)(1) ) = sqrt( (-1) +1 ) = sqrt(0) \u2192 wait, that can't be right. Wait, |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = | -i |^2 + |1|^2 = 1 + 1 = 2. So the normalized vector is [ -i / sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but that's in the basis of |+z> and |-z>. So |+y> is (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2). Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of real and imaginary components. Alternatively, maybe I can express |+y> as (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) multiplied by a phase factor.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that the initial state |+z> can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y>. Let's write:\n\n|+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>\n\nWe can find a and b by expanding in terms of |+y> and |-y>.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the time evolution of the expectation value <Sz> as a function of time.\n\nThe system is in state |+z> at t=0. The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. The time evolution is given by the time evolution operator U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ).\n\nThe expectation value of Sz at time t is <Sz(t)> = <\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)>, where |\u03c8(t)> = U(t) |+z>.\n\nBut perhaps using the time-dependent perturbation theory or transition probabilities is more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the energy eigenbasis approach.\n\nSince the initial state |+z> can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of H, which are |+y> and |-y>, the time evolution will cause each component to acquire a phase factor. The expectation value will then involve terms oscillating at the frequency determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates.\n\nLet me denote the eigenstates of H as |E+> and |E->, with energies E+ and E-.\n\nSo |E+> is |+y>, and |E-> is |-y>.\n\nThe initial state |+z> can be written as:\n\n|+z> = c_+ |E+> + c_- |E->\n\nThe coefficients c_+ and c_- can be found by expressing |+z> in terms of |E+> and |E->.\n\nWait, but I think I need to find the expansion coefficients. Let me think about the basis. Let me write |+y> as (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2). Wait, perhaps earlier calculation was off. Let me correct that.\n\nThe eigenvalue equation for H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, H = -gamma B (Sy), but Sy is (\u0127/2) sigma_y. So H = -gamma B (\u0127/2) sigma_y.\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of H would be -gamma B (\u0127/2) times the eigenvalues of sigma_y, which are \u00b11. So E_+ = (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) * 1 = -gamma B \u0127 / 2, and E_- = (-gamma B (\u0127/2)) * (-1) )= gamma B \u0127 / 2.\n\nSo the energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2) - (-gamma B \u0127/2) )= gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe time evolution of the state is |\u03c8(t)> = exp(-i H t / \u0127 ) |+z>.\n\nExpressed in terms of |E+> and |E->, this becomes:\n\n|\u03c8(t)> = c_+ exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) |E+> + c_- exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) |E->\n\nThe expectation value of Sz is:\n\n<Sz(t)> = <\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)>\n\nWhich expands into terms involving c_+^* c_+ <E+| Sz |E+>, c_+^* c_- <E+| Sz |E-> exp(i (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 ), and c_-^* c_- <E-| Sz |E->, plus the complex conjugate terms.\n\nBut wait, for spin-1/2, the Sz operator has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 for |+z> and |-z>.\n\nBut what are the matrix elements of Sz between |E+> and |E->? Let me think. Since |E+> and |E-> are eigenstates of Sy, which doesn't commute with Sz.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute <E+| Sz |E->. Let me express |E+> and |E-> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\nEarlier, we saw that |E+> = |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2)\nAnd |E-> = |-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo, let me compute <E+| Sz |E->.\n\nFirst, Sz |E+> = (\u0127/2) |+z> ?\n\nWait, no. Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. So Sz |+z> = (\u0127/2)|+z>, and Sz |-z> = (-\u0127/2)|-z>.\n\nSo, applying Sz to |E+>:\n\nSz |E+> = Sz [ (|+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n= ( Sz |+z> + i Sz |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> + i (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ |+z> - i |-z> ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ (|+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n= (\u0127/2) |E-> ?\n\nWait, because |E-> is (|+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2). So, yes, Sz |E+> = (\u0127/2) |E->.\n\nSimilarly, Sz |E-> = (\u0127/2) |E+> ?\n\nLet me check: Sz |E-> = Sz [ (|+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]\n= ( Sz |+z> - i Sz |-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z> - i (-\u0127/2)|-z> ) / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) [ |+z> + i |-z> ) ] / sqrt(2)\n= (\u0127/2) |E+>\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, now, <E+| Sz |E+> = <E+| (\u0127/2) |E+> = (\u0127/2) <E+|E+> = \u0127/2.\n\nSimilarly, <E-| Sz |E-> = \u0127/2.\n\nBut what about the cross terms <E+| Sz |E->?\n\nFrom above, Sz |E+> = (\u0127/2) |E->, so <E+| Sz |E-> = (\u0127/2) <E+|E-> = 0, since |E+> and |E-> are orthogonal.\n\nSo the expectation value <Sz(t)> becomes:\n\n= |c_+|^2 (\u0127/2) + |c_-|^2 (\u0127/2) + c_+ c_-^* exp( i (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 ) (0) + c_- c_+^* exp( -i (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 ) (0)\nWait, that can't be right. Because I think I might have made a mistake in the cross terms.\n\nWait, no, the cross terms are c_+^* c_- <E+| Sz |E-> exp( i (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 )\n\nBut since <E+| Sz |E-> is zero, those terms are zero.\n\nWait, but that would imply that <Sz(t)> is just |c_+|^2 (\u0127/2) + |c_-|^2 (\u0127/2).\n\nBut that can't be the case because the state |+z> is a combination of |E+> and |E->, and when the state evolves, the expectation value should oscillate.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the expansion should be:\n\n<Sz(t)> = |c_+|^2 (\u0127/2) + |c_-|^2 (-\u0127/2) + c_+ c_-^* exp( i (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 ) <E+| Sz |E-> + c_- c_+^* exp( -i (E_- - E_+ ) t / \u0127 ) <E-| Sz |E+>\n\nWait, but I thought that <E+| Sz |E-> is zero. But let me recompute.\n\nWait, Sz |E+> = (\u0127/2) |E->, so <E+| Sz |E-> = (\u0127/2) <E+| E-> ) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, <E-| Sz |E+> = (\u0127/2) <E-| E+> ) = 0.\n\nSo the cross terms are zero. Therefore, <Sz(t)> is |c_+|^2 (\u0127/2) + |c_-|^2 (-\u0127/2).\n\nWait, but that would mean the expectation value is time-independent, which contradicts the problem statement that says it starts oscillating.\n\nHmm, that must mean I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not expand the Hamiltonian in terms of its eigenstates but use a different approach. Let's think about the time evolution of the expectation value.\n\nThe initial state is |+z>. The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y.\n\nThe time evolution is given by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, so the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)> = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ) |+z>.\n\nThe expectation value of Sz is <Sz(t)> = <\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)>\n\nWe can compute this using the time-evolved state. Alternatively, perhaps using the Heisenberg picture would be easier, where the operator evolves with the Hamiltonian.\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the operator Sz(t) is given by:\n\nSz(t) = exp( i H t / \u0127 ) Sz exp( -i H t / \u0127 )\n\nThe expectation value is <Sz(t)> = <+z| Sz(t) |+z>\n\nSo, we can compute d<Sz>/dt and find the frequency of oscillation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the time evolution of the expectation value is given by the Ehrenfest theorem, which says that d<S>/dt = (1/i\u0127) < [S, H] >.\n\nSo, let me compute d<Sz>/dt.\n\nd<Sz>/dt = (1/i\u0127) < [Sz, H] >.\n\nH is proportional to Sy. So [Sz, H] = [Sz, -gamma B Sy ] = -gamma B [Sz, Sy].\n\nWe know that [Sz, Sy] = i\u0127 Sz, because [S_i, S_j] = i \u0127 \u03b5_{ijk} S_k.\n\nSo [Sz, Sy] = i \u0127 Sx.\n\nWait, let me think: the commutator [Sz, Sy] = i \u0127 Sx.\n\nSo, [Sz, H] = -gamma B [Sz, Sy] = -gamma B (i \u0127 Sx) = -i gamma B \u0127 Sx.\n\nThus, d<Sz>/dt = (1/(i\u0127)) < -i gamma B \u0127 Sx > = (1/(i\u0127)) ( -i gamma B \u0127 <Sx> ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe i's cancel: (1/(i\u0127)) * (-i) = ( -i ) / (i\u0127) ) = (-i)/(i \u0127) )= (-1)/\u0127 * (i/i) )= (-1)/\u0127 *1? Wait, no, because (-i)/(i) )= - (i^2)/(i^2) )= - ( (-1) ) / ( (-1) ) )= 1? Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.\n\n(-i)/(i) = (-i)(1/i) )= (-i)(-i) )= (i^2) )= -1.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, 1/i = -i, because i * (-i) = 1.\n\nSo, (-i) / i = (-i) * (1/i) )= (-i)(-i) )= i^2 = -1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nd<Sz>/dt = (1/(i\u0127)) * ( -i gamma B \u0127 <Sx> ) )\n\n= (1/(i\u0127)) * ( -i gamma B \u0127 <Sx> )\n\n= (1/(i\u0127)) * ( -i gamma B \u0127 ) <Sx>\n\n= (1/(i\u0127)) * (-i gamma B \u0127 ) <Sx>\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe i's: (1/i) * (-i) )= (1/i) * (-i) )= - (i^2) )= - (-1) )= 1.\n\nThe \u0127 terms: \u0127 / \u0127 = 1.\n\nSo d<Sz>/dt = gamma B <Sx>.\n\nHmm, that's an equation: d<Sz>/dt = gamma B <Sx>.\n\nBut we need another equation to relate d<Sx>/dt.\n\nAgain, using Ehrenfest:\n\nd<Sx>/dt = (1/i\u0127) < [Sx, H] >.\n\nH is -gamma B Sy, so [Sx, H] = -gamma B [Sx, Sy].\n\nWe know that [Sx, Sy] = i \u0127 Sz.\n\nSo [Sx, H] = -gamma B (i \u0127 Sz ) = -i gamma B \u0127 Sz.\n\nThus,\n\nd<Sx>/dt = (1/(i \u0127)) < [Sx, H] > = (1/(i \u0127)) ( -i gamma B \u0127 <Sz> ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/(i \u0127)) * (-i gamma B \u0127 ) <Sz> )\n\n= (1/(i \u0127)) * (-i gamma B \u0127 ) <Sz>\n\n= ( -i gamma B <Sz> ) / i )\n\nBecause (1/(i \u0127)) * (-i gamma B \u0127 ) = ( (-i gamma B ) / i ) ) * ( \u0127 / \u0127 ) )= ( (-i gamma B ) / i ) ) *1.\n\nSo, (-i)/i = (-i^2)/i^2 * i^2? Wait, perhaps better to compute it as:\n\n(-i)/(i) )= (-i)(1/i) )= (-i)(-i) )= i^2 = -1.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, 1/i = -i, so (-i) * (1/i) )= (-i)(-i) )= i^2 = -1.\n\nSo,\n\nd<Sx>/dt = (-i gamma B ) / i ) * <Sz>\n\n= ( -i / i ) * gamma B <Sz>\n\n= (-i^2) gamma B <Sz> = (1) gamma B <Sz>\n\nSo,\n\nd<Sx>/dt = gamma B <Sz>\n\nSo now we have two coupled differential equations:\n\nd<Sz>/dt = gamma B <Sx>\nd<Sx>/dt = gamma B <Sz>\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Let me write them as:\n\nd<Sz>/dt = gamma B Sx\nd<Sx>/dt = gamma B Sz\n\nThis is a system of ODEs that can be solved.\n\nLet me let a(t) = <Sz>, and b(t) = <Sx>.\n\nThen,\n\nda/dt = gamma B b\ndb/dt = gamma B a\n\nThis is a system of linear ODEs. To solve this, perhaps I can take the derivative of a twice.\n\nDifferentiating da/dt:\n\nd\u00b2a/dt\u00b2 = gamma B db/dt = gamma B (gamma B a) )= (gamma B)^2 a\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2a/dt\u00b2 = (gamma B)^2 a\n\nThe general solution to this is a(t) = A cos( gamma B t ) + B sin( gamma B t )\n\nSimilarly, since db/dt = gamma B a, the solution for b(t) would involve the same frequencies.\n\nBut wait, in the initial condition, at t=0, what are a(0) and b(0)?\n\nAt t=0, the state is |+z>, so <Sz> = (gamma \u0127/2) (since mu = gamma Sz, but wait, Sz has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So <Sz> = (gamma) * (\u0127/2). Wait, no, mu is gamma Sz, so <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.\n\nWait, the initial state is |+z>, so <Sz> = \u0127/2.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz. So <mu_z> = gamma <Sz> = gamma (\u0127/2).\n\nWait, but in our variables, a(t) is <Sz>, so a(0) = <Sz> = \u0127/2.\n\nSimilarly, <Sx> at t=0: in the state |+z>, <Sx> is zero because |+z> is an eigenstate of Sz, so the expectation value of Sx is zero.\n\nSo, initial conditions:\n\na(0) = \u0127/2\nb(0) = 0\n\nSo, applying to a(t):\n\na(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t )\n\nAt t=0:\n\na(0) = A = \u0127/2\n\nSo, A = \u0127/2.\n\nNow, the derivative of a(t) is:\n\nda/dt = - (gamma B) ( \u0127/2 ) sin(gamma B t) + B gamma B cos(gamma B t )\n\nAt t=0, da/dt = B (gamma B) * 1 = B gamma B.\n\nBut from da/dt = gamma B b(t), and at t=0, b(0)=0. So:\n\nda/dt at t=0 is 0.\n\nSo,\n\n0 = - (gamma B)( \u0127/2 ) * 0 + B (gamma B) * 1 \u2192 0 + B gamma B = 0 \u2192 B gamma B = 0 \u2192 B =0.\n\nSo, B =0.\n\nThus, a(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nSimilarly, since db/dt = gamma B a(t), integrating:\n\nb(t) = (gamma B) \u222b a(t) dt + C\n\nBut from initial conditions, b(0)=0, so C=0.\n\nSo,\n\nb(t) = (gamma B) \u222b (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t) dt\n= (gamma B) * (\u0127/(2 gamma B)) ) sin(gamma B t )\n= (\u0127/2) sin(gamma B t )\n\nThus,\n\n<Sz(t)> = a(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nWait, but wait: the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz, so the z-component of the magnetic moment is mu_z = gamma <Sz>.\n\nSo,\n\n< mu_z (t) > = gamma <Sz(t)> = gamma ( \u0127/2 ) cos(gamma B t )\n\nThe average of the z-component oscillates with frequency gamma B.\n\nWait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So the frequency is gamma B. Looking at the options, option B is gamma B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes the actual frequency is different.\n\nWait, the equation says cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency omega is gamma B. The frequency f is omega/(2 pi) ), but the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is omega. So the answer would be gamma B, which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait, another approach: when the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy, the energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B \u0127/2 ), E_- = (-gamma B \u0127/2 )\n\nThe energy difference is E_+ - E_- = gamma B \u0127.\n\nThe time period for oscillations in expectation values would be T = 2 pi / omega, where omega is the angular frequency, which is (E_+ - E_- ) / \u0127 = (gamma B \u0127 ) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo the angular frequency is gamma B, so the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the average oscillates with frequency gamma B, which matches option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched to point along the $+y$ direction, and the task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  \n   Initially, the particle is in the state $|+z\\rangle$, an eigenstate of $S_z$. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. This Hamiltonian is proportional to $S_y$, which does not commute with $S_z$, so the initial state is no longer an eigenstate of $H$.\n\n2. **Time Evolution**:  \n   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The state at time $t$ evolves as $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar}|+z\\rangle$. The expectation value of $S_z$ oscillates due to the interference between energy eigenstates of $H$.\n\n3. **Coupled Differential Equations**:  \n   Using Ehrenfest's theorem, the time derivatives of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle S_x \\rangle$ are found to satisfy the coupled equations:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\langle S_z \\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma B \\langle S_x \\rangle, \\quad \\frac{d\\langle S_x \\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma B \\langle S_z \\rangle.\n   \\]\n   These equations describe oscillations between $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle S_x \\rangle$ with a frequency determined by $\\gamma B$.\n\n4. **Solution for $\\langle S_z \\rangle$**:  \n   Solving the coupled equations yields:\n   \\[\n   \\langle S_z \\rangle(t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   The oscillation of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ occurs with angular frequency $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n5. **Magnetic Moment Oscillation**:  \n   Since the magnetic moment is $\\mu = \\gamma S_z$, the $z$-component of the magnetic moment oscillates as:\n   \\[\n   \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle(t) = \\gamma \\langle S_z \\rangle(t) = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t).\n   \\]\n   The oscillation frequency of $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$ is therefore $\\gamma B$.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
