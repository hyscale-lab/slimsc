      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.\n\nAlright, the problem says each spin S can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [ S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3 ]. And we need to find the partition function Z. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out by considering all possible states and calculating their energies.\n\nWait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2 E), right? Since \u03b2 is 1/(kT), that makes sense. So each term in Z is e^(-\u03b2 E_i) where E_i is the energy of state i.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out all possible states for the three spins. Each spin has two possibilities, so total states are 2^3 = 8. Let me list them:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nNow, for each state, I need to compute E and then calculate the exponential term.\n\nLet me compute E for each:\n\nThe energy is E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3 )\n\nSo each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1.\n\nLet's compute each E:\n\n1. All +1s:\n\nS1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. E = -J *3 \u2192 E = -3J.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. E= -J*(-1) = J.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:\n\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:\n\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check that. S2 and S3 are both -1, so S2 S3 is (-1)(-1) = 1. So for state 4: S1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1, S1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1, S2S3 = (-1)(-1)= +1. So sum is (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1. So E is J.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1, S1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1 \u2192 E= J.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1, S1S3 = (-1)(-1) = 1, S2S3= (-1)(+1) = -1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1 \u2192 E= J.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:\n\nS1S2= (+1) (since (-1)(-1)=1), S1S3= (-1)(+1)= -1, S2S3= (-1)(+1)= -1. Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1 \u2192 E= J.\n\nWait, wait no, S1S3 is (-1)(+1) = -1, S2S3 is (-1)(+1)= -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1 \u2192 E= J.\n\n8. All -1s:\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3 \u2192 E= -3J.\n\nSo looking at all the states:\n\nState 1: E=-3J \u2192 term is e^{ \u03b2*3J } because E is -3J, so -\u03b2 E is 3J\u03b2. So term is e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nWait no, wait. The formula is e^(-\u03b2 E). So for E=-3J, e^{-\u03b2*(-3J)} = e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nSimilarly, for the states where E=J, the term is e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nLet me see how many states have E=-3J and how many have E=J.\n\nLooking back:\n\nOnly state 1 and state 8 have E=-3J. So two states contribute e^{3J\u03b2} each.\n\nThe other 6 states (2,3,4,5,6,7) all have E= J. So each contributes e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nWait, no, wait. E= J for each of these 6 states. So each of these contributes e^{-\u03b2* J}.\n\nSo the partition function Z is:\n\nZ = 2 * e^{3 J \u03b2} + 6 * e^{-J \u03b2}\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 2e^{-3J\u03b2} +6e^{J\u03b2} \u2192 No, because for E=-3J, the exponent is positive.\n\nOption B: 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 Yes, that's what I got.\n\nOption C: 2e^{2J\u03b2} +6e^{-2J\u03b2} \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption D: 6e^{2J\u03b2} +2e^{-2J\u03b2} \u2192 No.\n\nWait, but I should double-check the number of states.\n\nWait, state 1: all +1 \u2192 E=-3J.\n\nStates 2,3,4,5,6,7: each has E=J.\n\nState 8: all -1 \u2192 E=-3J.\n\nSo that's two states with E=-3J, and six with E=J.\n\nSo Z = 2 * e^{3 J \u03b2} + 6 * e^{- J \u03b2}.\n\nWhich matches option B: Z=2 e^(3J\u03b2) +6 e^(-J\u03b2).\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

I need to find the partition function Z. Let's see, I remember the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), where beta is 1/(kT). \n\nWait, but each spin has two possible states, right? So for three spins, the total number of states is 2^3 =8. I think I need to list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-beta E) for all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without listing all possibilities. Let me think about the structure of the energy. The energy is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. Each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are the same or opposite.\n\nWait, but the energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each pair contributes a term. Let's think about each possible configuration and what their energies would be.\n\nBut maybe another approach is better. Let me consider that each pair can be in a ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic state. But wait, J's sign isn't given here. Hmm, but the problem statement just gives the energy as E = -J [ ... ].\n\nWait, let me think about each possible state. Each spin can be +1 or -1. So for three spins, there are 8 possible states:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nFor each of these, I'll compute the value of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nLet's compute each:\n\n1. All +1: S1S2 =1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J\n2. S3 is -1: S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1. E = -J*(-1) = J\n3. S2 is -1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1= -1. E= J\n4. S3 is -1, S2 is -1: S1S2= -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. E=J\n5. S1=-1, others +1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 =-1. E=J\n6. S3=-1: S1=-1, S2=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 =-1. E=J\n7. S3=+1: S1=-1, S2=-1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: 1 -1 -1 =-1. E=J\n8. All -1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. E = -3J\n\nWait, that's interesting. So in the first and last cases, all spins are same, so each pair is +1. So their sum is 3. So E is -3J for these two states.\n\nIn the other six cases, the sum is -1, so E is J.\n\nWait, so in all, there are two states with energy -3J and six states with energy J.\n\nSo the partition function Z is sum_{n} exp(-beta E_n), where E_n is the energy for each state.\n\nSo for each state, the contribution is exp(beta E_n * (-1)) because E is negative.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, partition function is sum exp(-beta E). So for each state, calculate exp( -beta E ) and sum them.\n\nSo for the two states with E = -3J: exp(-beta*(-3J)) = exp(3 beta J).\n\nFor each of the six states with E = J: exp(-beta*(J)) = exp(-beta J).\n\nSo Z = 2 * exp(3 beta J) + 6 * exp(-beta J).\n\nLooking at the options, let's see:\n\nOption A: 2 e^{-3J beta} +6 e^{J beta} \u2192 no, because the first term is e^{-3...} which is wrong.\n\nOption B: 2 e^{3J beta} +6 e^{-J beta} \u2192 yes!

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. Let's see, I remember the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), where beta is 1/(kT). \n\nWait, but each spin has two possible states, right? So for three spins, the total number of states is 2^3 =8. I think I need to list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-beta E) for all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without listing all possibilities. Let me think about the structure of the energy. The energy is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. Each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are the same or opposite.\n\nWait, but the energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each pair contributes a term. Let's think about each possible configuration and what their energies would be.\n\nBut maybe another approach is better. Let me consider that each pair can be in a ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic state. But wait, J's sign isn't given here. Hmm, but the problem statement just gives the energy as E = -J [ ... ].\n\nWait, let me think about each possible state. Each spin can be +1 or -1. So for three spins, there are 8 possible states:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nFor each of these, I'll compute the value of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nLet's compute each:\n\n1. All +1: S1S2 =1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J\n2. S3 is -1: S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1. E = -J*(-1) = J\n3. S2 is -1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1= -1. E= J\n4. S3 is -1, S2 is -1: S1S2= -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. E=J\n5. S1=-1, others +1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 =-1. E=J\n6. S3=-1: S1=-1, S2=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 =-1. E=J\n7. S3=+1: S1=-1, S2=-1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: 1 -1 -1 =-1. E=J\n8. All -1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. E = -3J\n\nWait, that's interesting. So in the first and last cases, all spins are same, so each pair is +1. So their sum is 3. So E is -3J for these two states.\n\nIn the other six cases, the sum is -1, so E is J.\n\nWait, so in all, there are two states with energy -3J and six states with energy J.\n\nSo the partition function Z is sum_{n} exp(-beta E_n), where E_n is the energy for each state.\n\nSo for each state, the contribution is exp(beta E_n * (-1)) because E is negative.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, partition function is sum exp(-beta E). So for each state, calculate exp( -beta E ) and sum them.\n\nSo for the two states with E = -3J: exp(-beta*(-3J)) = exp(3 beta J).\n\nFor each of the six states with E = J: exp(-beta*(J)) = exp(-beta J).\n\nSo Z = 2 * exp(3 beta J) + 6 * exp(-beta J).\n\nLooking at the options, let's see:\n\nOption A: 2 e^{-3J beta} +6 e^{J beta} \u2192 no, because the first term is e^{-3...} which is wrong.\n\nOption B: 2 e^{3J beta} +6 e^{-J beta} \u2192 yes! Because two terms with e^{3J beta}, six terms with e^{-J beta}.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nThe two states have E = -3J \u2192 their contribution is exp(3J beta), correct. The six states have E = J \u2192 exp(-J beta). So Z is 2 e^{3J beta} + 6 e^{-J beta}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is that.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). Each spin can be +1 or -1, so each spin S can be either +1 or -1. \n\nThe energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Wait, so each pair contributes a term. Let's think about what that means for the energy.\n\nEach of the three terms S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3 can be either +1 or -1, right? Because each S is either +1 or -1, so their product is +1 if they're the same, -1 if different.\n\nSo the total energy E would be -J times the sum of those three products. Let me denote the sum as S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J * S. \n\nWait, but what are the possible values of S? Let me think. Let's consider all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 =8 possible states. \n\nI think I should calculate E for each of these 8 states and then find their contributions to the partition function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to count the number of states that give a particular value of S. Because each term in S can be +1 or -1, the sum S can range from -3 to +3, but wait, let's see. Each term is either +1 or -1. So with three terms, the sum S can be 3, 1, -1, or -3? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, each term is the product of two spins, so each term can be +1 or -1. So the sum S can be 3 (all three terms +1), 1 (two terms +1, one -1), -1 (two terms -1, one +1), or -3 (all three terms -1). Hmm, but wait, is that possible? Because the sum of three +1 and -1 terms can be 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, let me think: if all three terms are +1, S=3. If two are +1, one is -1, S= 2 -1 =1. If one is +1, two are -1, S= 1-2= -1. If all three are -1, S=-3.\n\nSo possible values for S are 3,1,-1,-3. So for each possible S, I can count how many states (i.e., how many spin configurations) give that S. Then the energy E for each S is -J*S, so the Boltzmann factor would be exp(\u03b2 J S), because E = -J S \u2192 -\u03b2 E = \u03b2 J S.\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-\u03b2 E) = sum exp(\u03b2 J S). Alternatively, since each state contributes exp(\u03b2 J S), and states with the same S will have the same contribution, I can group them.\n\nSo for each S, count the number of states N(S) that give that S, then Z = sum N(S) exp(\u03b2 J S).\n\nSo first, let's find N(S) for each possible S.\n\nCase 1: S=3. All three terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are +1. So S1S2=1 \u2192 S1=S2. Similarly, S1=S3 and S2=S3. So all three spins are the same. So S1=S2=S3=+1 or all -1. So how many states? Two: all +1 or all -1. So N(3)=2.\n\nCase 2: S=1. Two terms +1, one term -1. Let's think about this. How many spin configurations give this?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the possible values of S1, S2, S3. Let's see. For S=1, the sum of the three terms is 1. So two terms are +1, one is -1.\n\nEach term is the product of two spins. So for two terms to be +1 and one to be -1, what does that imply about the spins?\n\nLet me think about the possible spin configurations. Let's say S1, S2, S3 can be either +1 or -1.\n\nLet me try a few examples:\n\nSuppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. Then all three products are +1, so S=3. That's covered.\n\nWhat if S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then:\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1. So sum S= 1-1-1 = -1. So this state gives S=-1.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for S=1. Hmm.\n\nAnother example: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nThen S1S2 = -1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nNot S=1. Hmmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the possible spin configurations that result in S=1. Let's think about how many such states there are.\n\nEach term being +1 or -1. So for S=1, two of the three terms are +1, one is -1. So how many spin configurations give two terms as +1 and one as -1.\n\nBut each term is a product of two spins. So perhaps it's easier to think about the spin configurations and how they contribute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of states with S=1 is 6. Let me think: for S=1, how many spin configurations result in two terms being +1 and one being -1.\n\nWait, maybe let's consider the number of ways the three terms can have two +1 and one -1. Each term is a product of two spins. So each term is +1 if the two spins are the same, -1 otherwise.\n\nSo for a term S_i S_j, it's +1 if S_i = S_j, else -1.\n\nSo for the three terms, to have two +1 and one -1, two of the pairs must be same, and one pair must be different.\n\nWait, but in a system of three spins, the parity of the number of differing pairs must be even or something? I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the spin configurations.\n\nWait, three spins can have different configurations. Let's list all 8 possibilities.\n\nWait, but that's a bit time-consuming, but perhaps necessary.\n\nThe 8 possible states are:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 \u2192 All products are +1 \u2192 S=3 \u2192 N=2.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1 \u2192 S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum S=1-1-1=-1.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1 \u2192 S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum S= -1 +1 -1 =-1.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1 \u2192 S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1 \u2192 sum S= -1 -1 +1 =-1.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1 \u2192 S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1 \u2192 sum S= -1 -1 +1 =-1.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1 \u2192 S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum S= -1 +1 -1 =-1.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1 \u2192 S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum S= 1-1-1 =-1.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1 \u2192 All products are +1 \u2192 sum S=3 \u2192 N=2.\n\nWait, looking at the above, states 1 and 8 give S=3. All others (states 2-7) have S=-1. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought S could be 3,1,-1,-3. But according to this, in all these 8 cases, S is either 3 or -1. So where's the S=1 or S=-3?\n\nWait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in evaluating the sum S for each state?\n\nWait, let me recheck some of them.\n\nTake state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = 1*1 =1.\n\nS1S3=1*(-1) =-1.\n\nS2S3=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nSum S = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. Correct.\n\nState 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2=+1*-1 =-1.\n\nS1S3=+1*+1=+1.\n\nS2S3=-1*+1=-1.\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nState 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2=+1*-1=-1.\n\nS1S3=+1*-1=-1.\n\nS2S3=-1*-1=+1.\n\nSum: -1-1+1 =-1.\n\nState 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2=-1*+1=-1.\n\nS1S3=-1*+1=-1.\n\nS2S3=+1*+1=+1.\n\nSum: -1-1+1 =-1.\n\nState 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2=-1*+1=-1.\n\nS1S3=-1*-1=+1.\n\nS2S3=+1*-1=-1.\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 =-1.\n\nState 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2=(-1)(-1)=1.\n\nS1S3=(-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nS2S3=(-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nSum: 1 -1 -1 =-1.\n\nWait, so all the non-fully-aligned states (i.e., not all +1 or all -1) have S=-1. So the only possible values of S are 3 and -1. So S can't be 1 or -3? That contradicts my earlier assumption.\n\nBut that's what the calculations show. So that must be the case. So the possible S are 3 and -1 only.\n\nWait, but how? Because when I thought of each term being +1 or -1, I thought that the sum could be 3, 1, -1, -3. But apparently, for three spins, it's only 3 and -1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I was wrong in my initial assumption. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that each of the three terms can independently be +1 or -1. But in reality, the terms are not independent because they share spins. So the sum of the terms may not cover all possibilities.\n\nSo in this problem, the sum S can only take two values: 3 and -1. Because any state that isn't all +1 or all -1 will have S=-1.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, let me think about another example. What if the three spins are S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: sum is 3.\n\nIf any one of the spins is flipped, say S3=-1, then the sum becomes 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nSimilarly, if two spins are flipped: say S2=-1, S3=-1, then S1S2 = (-1)(+1) =-1, S1S3 = (-1)(+1)=-1, S2S3= (-1)(-1)=1. Sum is -1-1+1 =-1.\n\nIf all three spins are flipped (all -1), sum is 3.\n\nWait, so in any configuration that isn't all +1 or all -1, the sum S is -1. So the only possible S values are 3 and -1.\n\nSo N(3)=2 (all +1 and all -1).\n\nN(-1)=6 (all other states).\n\nSo now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(\u03b2 J S). Since each state contributes exp(\u03b2 J S), and the number of states with S=3 is 2, and with S=-1 is 6.\n\nSo Z = 2 * exp(\u03b2 J *3) + 6 * exp(\u03b2 J*(-1)).\n\nWait, because E = -J S, so the exponent is \u03b2 E = \u03b2 (-J S) \u2192 which is -\u03b2 J S. Wait, no, the Boltzmann factor is exp(-\u03b2 E), which is exp(\u03b2 J S), because E = -J S.\n\nWait, no: E = -J S \u2192 -\u03b2 E = \u03b2 J S.\n\nSo each state with S contributes exp(\u03b2 J S).\n\nSo the two states with S=3 contribute 2 * exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nThe six states with S=-1 contribute 6 * exp(- \u03b2 J *1) \u2192 because S=-1.\n\nSo Z = 2 e^{3 \u03b2 J} + 6 e^{- \u03b2 J}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}, which matches. Option A is the opposite, with exponents -3 and +J, which doesn't fit.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). Each spin can be +1 or -1, so each spin S can be either +1 or -1. \n\nThe energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Wait, so each pair contributes a term. Let's think about what that means for the energy.\n\nEach of the three terms S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3 can be either +1 or -1, right? Because each S is either +1 or -1, so their product is +1 if they're the same, -1 if different.\n\nSo the total energy E would be -J times the sum of those three products. Let me denote the sum as S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J * S. \n\nWait, but what are the possible values of S? Let me think. Let's consider all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 =8 possible states. \n\nI think I should calculate E for each of these 8 states and then find their contributions to the partition function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to count the number of states that give a particular value of S. Because each term in S can be +1 or -1, the sum S can range from -3 to +3, but wait, let's see. Each term is either +1 or -1. So with three terms, the sum S can be 3, 1, -1, or -3? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, each term is the product of two spins, so each term can be +1 or -1. So the sum S can be 3 (all three terms +1), 1 (two terms +1, one -1), -1 (two terms -1, one +1), or -3 (all three terms -1). Hmm, but wait, is that possible? Because the sum of three +1 and -1 terms can be 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, let me think: if all three terms are +1, S=3. If two are +1, one is -1, S= 2 -1 =1. If one is +1, two are -1, S= 1-2= -1. If all three are -1, S=-3.\n\nSo possible values for S are 3,1,-1,-3. So for each possible S, I can count how many states (i.e., how many spin configurations) give that S. Then the energy E for each S is -J*S, so the Boltzmann factor would be exp(\u03b2 J S), because E = -J S \u2192 -\u03b2 E = \u03b2 J S.\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-\u03b2 E) = sum exp(\u03b2 J S). Alternatively, since each state contributes exp(\u03b2 J S), and states with the same S will have the same contribution, I can group them.\n\nSo for each S, count the number of states N(S) that give that S, then Z = sum N(S) exp(\u03b2 J S).\n\nSo first, let's find N(S) for each possible S.\n\nCase 1: S=3. All three terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are +1. So S1S2=1 \u2192 S1=S2. Similarly, S1=S3 and S2=S3. So all three spins are the same. So S1=S2=S3=+1 or all -1. So how many states? Two: all +1 or all -1. So N(3)=2.\n\nCase 2: S=1. Two terms +1, one term -1. Let's think about this. How many spin configurations give this?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the possible values of S1, S2, S3. Let's see. For S=1, the sum of the three terms is 1. So two terms are +1, one is -1.\n\nEach term is the product of two spins. So for two terms to be +1 and one to be -1, what does that imply about the spins?\n\nLet me think about the possible spin configurations. Let's say S1, S2, S3 can be either +1 or -1.\n\nLet me try a few examples:\n\nSuppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. Then all three products are +1, so S=3. That's covered.\n\nWhat if S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then:\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1. So sum S= 1-1-1 = -1. So this state gives S=-1.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for S=1. Hmm.\n\nAnother example: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nThen S1S2 = -1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nNot S=1. Hmmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the possible spin configurations that result in S=1. Let's think about how many such states there are.\n\nEach term being +1 or -1. So for S=1, two of the three terms are +1, one is -1. So how many spin configurations give two terms as +1 and one as -1.\n\nBut each term is a product of two spins. So perhaps it's easier to think about the spin configurations and how they contribute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of states with S=1 is 6. Let me think: for S=1, how many spin configurations result in two terms being +1 and one being -1.\n\nWait, maybe let's consider the number of ways the three terms can have two +1 and one -1. Each term is a product of two spins. So each term is +1 if the two spins are the same, -1 otherwise.\n\nSo for a term S_i S_j, it's +1 if S_i = S_j, else -1.\n\nSo for the three terms, to have two +1 and one -1, two of the pairs must be same, and one pair must be different.\n\nWait, but in a system of three spins, the parity of the number of differing pairs must be even or something? I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the spin configurations.\n\nWait, three spins can have different configurations. Let's list all 8 possibilities.\n\nWait, but that's a bit time-consuming, but perhaps necessary.\n\nThe 8 possible states are:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 \u2192 All products are +1 \u2192 S=3 \u2192 N=2.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1 \u2192 S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum S=1-1-1=-1.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1 \u2192 S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum S= -1 +1 -1 =-1.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1 \u2192 S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1 \u2192 sum S= -1 -1 +1 =-1.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1 \u2192 S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1 \u2192 sum S= -1 -1 +1 =-1.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1 \u2192 S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum S= -1 +1 -1 =-1.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1 \u2192 S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum S= 1-1-1 =-1.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1 \u2192 All products are +1 \u2192 sum S=3 \u2192 N=2.\n\nWait, looking at the above, states 1 and 8 give S=3. All others (states 2-7) have S=-1. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought S could be 3,1,-1,-3. But according to this, in all these 8 cases, S is either 3 or -1. So where's the S=1 or S=-3?\n\nWait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in evaluating the sum S for each state?\n\nWait, let me recheck some of them.\n\nTake state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = 1*1 =1.\n\nS1S3=1*(-1) =-1.\n\nS2S3=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nSum S = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. Correct.\n\nState 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2=+1*-1 =-1.\n\nS1S3=+1*+1=+1.\n\nS2S3=-1*+1=-1.\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nState 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2=+1*-1=-1.\n\nS1S3=+1*-1=-1.\n\nS2S3=-1*-1=+1.\n\nSum: -1-1+1 =-1.\n\nState 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2=-1*+1=-1.\n\nS1S3=-1*+1=-1.\n\nS2S3=+1*+1=+1.\n\nSum: -1-1+1 =-1.\n\nState 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2=-1*+1=-1.\n\nS1S3=-1*-1=+1.\n\nS2S3=+1*-1=-1.\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 =-1.\n\nState 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2=(-1)(-1)=1.\n\nS1S3=(-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nS2S3=(-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nSum: 1 -1 -1 =-1.\n\nWait, so all the non-fully-aligned states (i.e., not all +1 or all -1) have S=-1. So the only possible values of S are 3 and -1. So S can't be 1 or -3? That contradicts my earlier assumption.\n\nBut that's what the calculations show. So that must be the case. So the possible S are 3 and -1 only.\n\nWait, but how? Because when I thought of each term being +1 or -1, I thought that the sum could be 3, 1, -1, -3. But apparently, for three spins, it's only 3 and -1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I was wrong in my initial assumption. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that each of the three terms can independently be +1 or -1. But in reality, the terms are not independent because they share spins. So the sum of the terms may not cover all possibilities.\n\nSo in this problem, the sum S can only take two values: 3 and -1. Because any state that isn't all +1 or all -1 will have S=-1.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, let me think about another example. What if the three spins are S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: sum is 3.\n\nIf any one of the spins is flipped, say S3=-1, then the sum becomes 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nSimilarly, if two spins are flipped: say S2=-1, S3=-1, then S1S2 = (-1)(+1) =-1, S1S3 = (-1)(+1)=-1, S2S3= (-1)(-1)=1. Sum is -1-1+1 =-1.\n\nIf all three spins are flipped (all -1), sum is 3.\n\nWait, so in any configuration that isn't all +1 or all -1, the sum S is -1. So the only possible S values are 3 and -1.\n\nSo N(3)=2 (all +1 and all -1).\n\nN(-1)=6 (all other states).\n\nSo now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(\u03b2 J S). Since each state contributes exp(\u03b2 J S), and the number of states with S=3 is 2, and with S=-1 is 6.\n\nSo Z = 2 * exp(\u03b2 J *3) + 6 * exp(\u03b2 J*(-1)).\n\nWait, because E = -J S, so the exponent is \u03b2 E = \u03b2 (-J S) \u2192 which is -\u03b2 J S. Wait, no, the Boltzmann factor is exp(-\u03b2 E), which is exp(\u03b2 J S), because E = -J S.\n\nWait, no: E = -J S \u2192 -\u03b2 E = \u03b2 J S.\n\nSo each state with S contributes exp(\u03b2 J S).\n\nSo the two states with S=3 contribute 2 * exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nThe six states with S=-1 contribute 6 * exp(- \u03b2 J *1) \u2192 because S=-1.\n\nSo Z = 2 e^{3 \u03b2 J} + 6 e^{- \u03b2 J}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}, which matches. Option A is the opposite, with exponents -3 and +J, which doesn't fit.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \\( Z \\) for a system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\). The energy of the system is given by \\( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \\), and the partition function is defined as \\( Z = \\sum_{\\text{all states}} e^{-\\beta E} \\), where \\( \\beta = 1/(kT) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Possible Values of \\( S \\)\nThe energy depends on the sum \\( S = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \\).

The Boltzmann factor for each state is \\( e^{-\\beta E} = e^{\\beta J S} \\). Grouping states by \\( S \\), the partition function becomes:\n\\[\nZ = N(3) e^{\\beta J \\cdot 3} + N(-1) e^{\\beta J \\cdot (-1)},\n\\]\nwhere \\( N(3) = 2 \\) and \\( N(-1) = 6 \\).

The energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.\n\nWait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), right? So I should figure out all possible states and their corresponding energies, then sum the exponentials.\n\nEach spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them all. Maybe I can represent each state as (S1, S2, S3).\n\nThe states are:\n1. (+1, +1, +1)\n2. (+1, +1, -1)\n3. (+1, -1, +1)\n4. (+1, -1, -1)\n5. (-1, +1, +1)\n6. (-1, +1, -1)\n7. (-1, -1, +1)\n8. (-1, -1, -1)\n\nFor each state, I need to compute the energy E. The formula is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).\n\nLet's compute each term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 for each state.\n\nState 1: All +1s.\nS1S2 = 1*1=1, same for all terms. So sum is 3. E = -J*(3) = -3J.\n\nState 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, no wait: wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate that. Sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, no. The formula is E = -J [sum]. So for sum = -1, E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nHmm, correct.\n\nState 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\nS1S2 = -1. S1S3=1. S2S3 = -1. Sum is (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1. So E = J again.\n\nSimilarly, state 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1. E= J.\n\nWait, state 4 sum: (-1) + (-1) + (1) = (-1 -1 +1) = -1. So same as states 2,3,4, which all have sum -1, E=J.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check each state.\n\nWait, for state 2: S3 is -1.\n\nS1S2 =1, S1S3= (1)(-1) = -1, S2S3= (1)(-1) = -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So yes, E= J.\n\nState 3: S2=-1, S3=+1. So S1S2= (1)(-1)=-1, S1S3=1*1=1, S2S3= (-1)(1)=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. So E= J.\n\nState 4: S3=-1. S1S2= (1)(-1)=-1, S1S3= (1)(-1)=-1, S2S3= (-1)(-1)=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.\n\nSo states 2,3,4 each have E= J. So that's three states each with E=J.\n\nState 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2= (-1)(1)=-1, S1S3= (-1)(1)=-1, S2S3= 1*1=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.\n\nSame as before. So state 5 is another one with E= J.\n\nWait, but how many states have E=J? Let me count.\n\nStates 2,3,4,5: that's four? Wait, no. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because in state 5, the sum is also -1, so E= J.\n\nWait, let me recount all states.\n\nState 1: sum 3 \u2192 E=-3J.\nStates 2,3,4,5,6,7: sum is -1 \u2192 E= J.\nState 8: sum is 3*(-1)*(-1) \u2192 Wait, state 8 is all -1s.\n\nWait, state 8: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E= -J*(3) = -3J.\n\nWait, so state 8 also has E=-3J, same as state 1.\n\nWait, so how many states have E=-3J? Only states 1 and 8.

That's six states.\n\nSo in total, Z is the sum over all states of exp( -\u03b2 E ).\n\nEach state contributes exp( -\u03b2 E ). But since E is same for states with same energy, we can group them.\n\nSo two states with E=-3J \u2192 each contributes exp( -\u03b2*(-3J) ) = exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nSix states with E= J \u2192 each contributes exp( -\u03b2 * J ) = exp( - \u03b2 J ).\n\nWait, wait, no: the energy is E = -J [sum], so for the states with sum=-1, E= J. So for each such state, the term is exp( -\u03b2 * E ) = exp( -\u03b2 * J ).\n\nWait, no, because E is -J*(sum). So for sum=-1, E= J. So in the exponential, it's exp(-\u03b2 E) = exp( -\u03b2 J ).\n\nWait, but let me think again. The energy E is given as E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So when the sum S1S2 + ... is 3, E is -3J. When the sum is -1, E is J.\n\nSo each state contributes exp(-\u03b2 E) \u2192 for E=-3J, it's exp(3 \u03b2 J), and for E=J, it's exp( - \u03b2 J ).\n\nSo Z = sum_{all states} exp(-\u03b2 E).\n\nSo Z = (number of states with E=-3J) * exp(3 \u03b2 J) + (number with E=J) * exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nWhich is Z = 2 exp(3 \u03b2 J) + 6 exp( -\u03b2 J ).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 2 e^{-3J\u03b2} +6 e^{J\u03b2}.\n\nOption B is 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nYes, so according to this, Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is that. So the correct answer is option B.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me double-check the energy calculation.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, E is given as E= -J [ S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3 ].\n\nSo for a state where sum = 3, E = -J*(3) = -3J.\n\nFor sum = -1, E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nSo yes, correct.\n\nSo each term in Z is exp( -beta * E ), which for E=-3J is exp(3 beta J).\n\nFor E=J, it's exp( -beta J ).\n\nSo Z = 2 exp(3 beta J) + 6 exp( - beta J ), which is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, let's see. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.\n\nWait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), right? So I should figure out all possible states and their corresponding energies, then sum the exponentials.\n\nEach spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them all. Maybe I can represent each state as (S1, S2, S3).\n\nThe states are:\n1. (+1, +1, +1)\n2. (+1, +1, -1)\n3. (+1, -1, +1)\n4. (+1, -1, -1)\n5. (-1, +1, +1)\n6. (-1, +1, -1)\n7. (-1, -1, +1)\n8. (-1, -1, -1)\n\nFor each state, I need to compute the energy E. The formula is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).\n\nLet's compute each term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 for each state.\n\nState 1: All +1s.\nS1S2 = 1*1=1, same for all terms. So sum is 3. E = -J*(3) = -3J.\n\nState 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, no wait: wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate that. Sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, no. The formula is E = -J [sum]. So for sum = -1, E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nHmm, correct.\n\nState 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\nS1S2 = -1. S1S3=1. S2S3 = -1. Sum is (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1. So E = J again.\n\nSimilarly, state 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1. E= J.\n\nWait, state 4 sum: (-1) + (-1) + (1) = (-1 -1 +1) = -1. So same as states 2,3,4, which all have sum -1, E=J.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check each state.\n\nWait, for state 2: S3 is -1.\n\nS1S2 =1, S1S3= (1)(-1) = -1, S2S3= (1)(-1) = -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So yes, E= J.\n\nState 3: S2=-1, S3=+1. So S1S2= (1)(-1)=-1, S1S3=1*1=1, S2S3= (-1)(1)=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. So E= J.\n\nState 4: S3=-1. S1S2= (1)(-1)=-1, S1S3= (1)(-1)=-1, S2S3= (-1)(-1)=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.\n\nSo states 2,3,4 each have E= J. So that's three states each with E=J.\n\nState 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2= (-1)(1)=-1, S1S3= (-1)(1)=-1, S2S3= 1*1=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.\n\nSame as before. So state 5 is another one with E= J.\n\nWait, but how many states have E=J? Let me count.\n\nStates 2,3,4,5: that's four? Wait, no. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because in state 5, the sum is also -1, so E= J.\n\nWait, let me recount all states.\n\nState 1: sum 3 \u2192 E=-3J.\nStates 2,3,4,5,6,7: sum is -1 \u2192 E= J.\nState 8: sum is 3*(-1)*(-1) \u2192 Wait, state 8 is all -1s.\n\nWait, state 8: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E= -J*(3) = -3J.\n\nWait, so state 8 also has E=-3J, same as state 1.\n\nWait, so how many states have E=-3J? Only states 1 and 8. So two states with E=-3J.\n\nThe other six states (states 2,3,4,5,6,7) each have E= J. Wait, no, wait: wait, no. Let me list all:\n\nWait, state 2: E=J.\n\nstate 3: E= J.\n\nstate 4: E= J.\n\nstate 5: E= J.\n\nstate 6: let's see. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(1)=-1.\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(-1)=1.\n\nS2S3 = (1)(-1)=-1.\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. So E= J.\n\nSimilarly, state 6: E= J.\n\nstate 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=(-1)(1)=-1, S2S3= (-1)(1)=-1. Sum: 1-1-1 = -1. E= J.\n\nSo states 2,3,4,5,6,7 have E= J. That's six states.\n\nSo in total, Z is the sum over all states of exp( -\u03b2 E ).\n\nEach state contributes exp( -\u03b2 E ). But since E is same for states with same energy, we can group them.\n\nSo two states with E=-3J \u2192 each contributes exp( -\u03b2*(-3J) ) = exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nSix states with E= J \u2192 each contributes exp( -\u03b2 * J ) = exp( - \u03b2 J ).\n\nWait, wait, no: the energy is E = -J [sum], so for the states with sum=-1, E= J. So for each such state, the term is exp( -\u03b2 * E ) = exp( -\u03b2 * J ).\n\nWait, no, because E is -J*(sum). So for sum=-1, E= J. So in the exponential, it's exp(-\u03b2 E) = exp( -\u03b2 J ).\n\nWait, but let me think again. The energy E is given as E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So when the sum S1S2 + ... is 3, E is -3J. When the sum is -1, E is J.\n\nSo each state contributes exp(-\u03b2 E) \u2192 for E=-3J, it's exp(3 \u03b2 J), and for E=J, it's exp( - \u03b2 J ).\n\nSo Z = sum_{all states} exp(-\u03b2 E).\n\nSo Z = (number of states with E=-3J) * exp(3 \u03b2 J) + (number with E=J) * exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nWhich is Z = 2 exp(3 \u03b2 J) + 6 exp( -\u03b2 J ).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 2 e^{-3J\u03b2} +6 e^{J\u03b2}.\n\nOption B is 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nYes, so according to this, Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is that. So the correct answer is option B.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me double-check the energy calculation.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, E is given as E= -J [ S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3 ].\n\nSo for a state where sum = 3, E = -J*(3) = -3J.\n\nFor sum = -1, E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nSo yes, correct.\n\nSo each term in Z is exp( -beta * E ), which for E=-3J is exp(3 beta J).\n\nFor E=J, it's exp( -beta J ).\n\nSo Z = 2 exp(3 beta J) + 6 exp( - beta J ), which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \\( Z \\) for a system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). \n\nWait, but wait. The spins are S1, S2, S3, each being \u00b11. So each spin has two possible states. Since there are three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. So I need to consider all 8 possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.\n\nBut calculating each state's energy and then adding exp(-\u03b2E) for each might be manageable. Let me think about how to approach this. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way by looking at the symmetries or the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nLet me think: S1, S2, S3 can each be +1 or -1. So for each pair, S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. The sum of the three terms can vary. Let's compute the possible values of the sum H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nWait, let's denote each term as follows. Let's list all possible states and compute H for each.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of the number of +1 and -1 terms in H. Alternatively, perhaps considering the number of aligned and anti-aligned pairs.\n\nWait, each S_i S_j is +1 if the two spins are aligned (same) and -1 if anti-aligned (opposite). So the sum H would be the number of aligned pairs minus the number of anti-aligned pairs.\n\nWait, because each term is +1 for aligned and -1 for anti. So for three pairs, the maximum sum would be 3 (all aligned), and the minimum would be -3 (all anti-aligned). But maybe the sum can take other values.\n\nWait, let's think of possible cases. \n\nCase 1: All three spins are the same. So S1=S2=S3=+1 or all -1.\n\nIn this case, each pair S_i S_j is +1. So H = 3. So E = -J *3.\n\nCase 2: Two spins are the same, and one is different. Let's say S1 and S2 are +1, S3 is -1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So H = 1 -1 -1 = -1. Similarly, if two are -1 and one is +1, same thing. So H = -1.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check. If two are same and one different, how does H look?\n\nLet me pick S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1.\n\nS1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So H = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, if S1 and S3 are +1, S2 is -1: S1S2 = -1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. H = -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, same result. So for all cases where two are same and one different, H is -1.\n\nCase 3: All three spins are different. Wait, no, that's impossible because each spin is either +1 or -1. If you have three spins, you can't have all three different because you only have two possible values. So the next possible case is when two are the same and one different, but perhaps I'm missing another case.\n\nWait, another possibility: when one spin is different. Wait, perhaps the case where all three are anti-aligned. Wait, no, because three spins can't all be anti-aligned in a triangle. Hmm, perhaps another scenario where all three are different? No, impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps when all three are arranged in a way that each pair is anti-aligned. But wait, with three spins, is that possible? Let me think: if S1 is +1, S2 is -1, S3 is +1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = +1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nHmm, same as case 2. So perhaps the sum H can be either 3 (all same) or -1 (when two are same, one different) or maybe another value?\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me list all possible 8 states and compute H for each.\n\nSo the 8 possible states are:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nH = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 +1 +1 =3.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nH = 1*1 + 1*(-1) +1*(-1) =1 -1 -1 =-1.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nH=1*(-1) +1*1 + (-1)*1 =-1 +1 -1 =-1.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nH=1*(-1) +1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) = -1 -1 +1 =-1.\n\nWait, that adds up to -1.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nH= (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) =-1 -1 +1 =-1.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nH= (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) =-1 +1 -1 =-1.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nH= (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) =1 -1 -1 =-1.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nH= (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) =1 +1 +1 =3.\n\nSo from this, I see that there are two states where H=3 (all spins same) and six states where H=-1. So for each of these, the energy E is -J times H.\n\nWait, no: E = -J * H. So for H=3, E = -J*3. For H=-1, E= -J*(-1) = J.\n\nSo each state contributes a term of exp(-\u03b2 E) to the partition function. Since each state is equally likely, and we have 8 states, but grouped into two categories: two with H=3, six with H=-1.\n\nSo Z is the sum over all states of exp(-\u03b2 E), which is the same as summing exp(\u03b2 J H) because E = -J H.\n\nWait, because E = -J H, so -\u03b2 E = \u03b2 J H. So each term in the sum is exp(\u03b2 J H).\n\nSo for each state, compute exp(\u03b2 J H).\n\nFor the two states where H=3: each contributes exp(3\u03b2 J).\n\nFor the six states where H=-1: each contributes exp(-\u03b2 J * 1) = exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nSo Z = 2 * exp(3\u03b2 J) + 6 * exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, let's check.\n\nOption A: Z= 2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6e^(J\u03b2) \u2192 No, because for H=3, exp(3\u03b2 J) is e^{3\u03b2 J}, but option A has e^{-3J\u03b2}.\n\nOption B: Z= 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 Yes, because that's exactly what I have here.\n\nWait, but wait: Let me double-check. For H=3, each term is exp(3\u03b2 J). For H=-1, each term is exp(-\u03b2 J * (-1))?

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). \n\nWait, but wait. The spins are S1, S2, S3, each being \u00b11. So each spin has two possible states. Since there are three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. So I need to consider all 8 possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.\n\nBut calculating each state's energy and then adding exp(-\u03b2E) for each might be manageable. Let me think about how to approach this. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way by looking at the symmetries or the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nLet me think: S1, S2, S3 can each be +1 or -1. So for each pair, S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. The sum of the three terms can vary. Let's compute the possible values of the sum H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nWait, let's denote each term as follows. Let's list all possible states and compute H for each.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of the number of +1 and -1 terms in H. Alternatively, perhaps considering the number of aligned and anti-aligned pairs.\n\nWait, each S_i S_j is +1 if the two spins are aligned (same) and -1 if anti-aligned (opposite). So the sum H would be the number of aligned pairs minus the number of anti-aligned pairs.\n\nWait, because each term is +1 for aligned and -1 for anti. So for three pairs, the maximum sum would be 3 (all aligned), and the minimum would be -3 (all anti-aligned). But maybe the sum can take other values.\n\nWait, let's think of possible cases. \n\nCase 1: All three spins are the same. So S1=S2=S3=+1 or all -1.\n\nIn this case, each pair S_i S_j is +1. So H = 3. So E = -J *3.\n\nCase 2: Two spins are the same, and one is different. Let's say S1 and S2 are +1, S3 is -1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So H = 1 -1 -1 = -1. Similarly, if two are -1 and one is +1, same thing. So H = -1.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check. If two are same and one different, how does H look?\n\nLet me pick S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1.\n\nS1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So H = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, if S1 and S3 are +1, S2 is -1: S1S2 = -1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. H = -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, same result. So for all cases where two are same and one different, H is -1.\n\nCase 3: All three spins are different. Wait, no, that's impossible because each spin is either +1 or -1. If you have three spins, you can't have all three different because you only have two possible values. So the next possible case is when two are the same and one different, but perhaps I'm missing another case.\n\nWait, another possibility: when one spin is different. Wait, perhaps the case where all three are anti-aligned. Wait, no, because three spins can't all be anti-aligned in a triangle. Hmm, perhaps another scenario where all three are different? No, impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps when all three are arranged in a way that each pair is anti-aligned. But wait, with three spins, is that possible? Let me think: if S1 is +1, S2 is -1, S3 is +1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = +1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nHmm, same as case 2. So perhaps the sum H can be either 3 (all same) or -1 (when two are same, one different) or maybe another value?\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me list all possible 8 states and compute H for each.\n\nSo the 8 possible states are:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nH = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 +1 +1 =3.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nH = 1*1 + 1*(-1) +1*(-1) =1 -1 -1 =-1.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nH=1*(-1) +1*1 + (-1)*1 =-1 +1 -1 =-1.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nH=1*(-1) +1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) = -1 -1 +1 =-1.\n\nWait, that adds up to -1.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nH= (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) =-1 -1 +1 =-1.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nH= (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) =-1 +1 -1 =-1.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nH= (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) =1 -1 -1 =-1.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nH= (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) =1 +1 +1 =3.\n\nSo from this, I see that there are two states where H=3 (all spins same) and six states where H=-1. So for each of these, the energy E is -J times H.\n\nWait, no: E = -J * H. So for H=3, E = -J*3. For H=-1, E= -J*(-1) = J.\n\nSo each state contributes a term of exp(-\u03b2 E) to the partition function. Since each state is equally likely, and we have 8 states, but grouped into two categories: two with H=3, six with H=-1.\n\nSo Z is the sum over all states of exp(-\u03b2 E), which is the same as summing exp(\u03b2 J H) because E = -J H.\n\nWait, because E = -J H, so -\u03b2 E = \u03b2 J H. So each term in the sum is exp(\u03b2 J H).\n\nSo for each state, compute exp(\u03b2 J H).\n\nFor the two states where H=3: each contributes exp(3\u03b2 J).\n\nFor the six states where H=-1: each contributes exp(-\u03b2 J * 1) = exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nSo Z = 2 * exp(3\u03b2 J) + 6 * exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, let's check.\n\nOption A: Z= 2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6e^(J\u03b2) \u2192 No, because for H=3, exp(3\u03b2 J) is e^{3\u03b2 J}, but option A has e^{-3J\u03b2}.\n\nOption B: Z= 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 Yes, because that's exactly what I have here.\n\nWait, but wait: Let me double-check. For H=3, each term is exp(3\u03b2 J). For H=-1, each term is exp(-\u03b2 J * (-1))? Wait no, wait E = -J H, so -\u03b2 E = \u03b2 J H.\n\nWait, H is 3: so exp(\u03b2 J *3) \u2192 e^{3\u03b2 J}.\n\nH is -1: exp(\u03b2 J*(-1)) \u2192 e^{- \u03b2 J}.\n\nSo for the six states with H=-1, each contributes e^{- \u03b2 J}, so 6 * e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nSo Z = 2 e^{3 \u03b2 J} +6 e^{- \u03b2 J}.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B is Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 which matches.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused because some options have different exponents.

The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). \n\nWait, so each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I need to list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate the energy for each, then sum the exponentials of -\u03b2E.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the symmetry here. The energy depends on the product of pairs of spins. Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 will determine the energy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can categorize the states based on the number of aligned pairs. Wait, no, because each term is S_i S_j, so each term is +1 if the spins are the same, and -1 otherwise. So the sum can be 3 (all three pairs same), 1 (two same, one different), -1 (two different, one same), or -3 (all three pairs different).\n\nWait, let me think again. For three spins, each pair is either aligned or not. If all three spins are the same, say +1, then all S_i S_j are +1. So the sum is 3. Similarly, if all are -1, same thing. So E would be -J*(3) = -3J. \n\nIf two spins are the same and the third is opposite, let's say S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So the sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Then E = -J*(-1) = J. \n\nWait wait, no. Wait, the energy E is given by E = -J (sum). So for the sum being -1, E is -J*(-1) = J. So each state where the sum is -1 gives energy J.\n\nSimilarly, if the sum is +1, then E = -J*(1) = -J.\n\nWait, wait, let me correct that. Suppose the sum is 3, E is -3J. If the sum is 1, E is -J*(1) = -J. If the sum is -1, E is J. If the sum is -3, E is 3J.\n\nWait, no, because E = -J*(sum). So sum = 3 \u2192 E=-3J, sum=1 \u2192 E=-J, sum=-1 \u2192 E= J, sum=-3 \u2192 E=3J.\n\nSo each state will contribute exp(\u03b2E) = exp(\u03b2*(-J sum)).\n\nWait, no, because E is -J sum. So for each state, the exponent is -\u03b2 E = -\u03b2 (-J sum) = \u03b2 J sum.\n\nWait, but the partition function is the sum over all states of exp(-\u03b2 E). So for each state, the term is exp(\u03b2 J sum), because E is -J sum.\n\nHmm. So for each state, the term is e^{ \u03b2 J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3) }.\n\nWait, let me make a table of all possible spin states and their energies.\n\nTotal possible states: 8.\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 \u2192 S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 \u2192 sum=3 \u2192 E = -3J \u2192 term is e^{\u03b2*3J}.\n\nWait no, because E is -J sum. So term is exp(\u03b2 E) = exp( -\u03b2 (-3J) ) = e^{3 \u03b2 J}.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the partition function term is exp(-\u03b2 E). E is given by E = -J sum. So exp(-\u03b2 E) = exp(\u03b2 J sum).\n\nSo for sum=3: exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nsum=1: exp(1 \u03b2 J).\n\nsum=-1: exp(-1 \u03b2 J).\n\nsum=-3: exp(-3 \u03b2 J).\n\nNow, I need to find how many states have each sum.\n\nCase 1: All spins same \u2192 sum=3. How many such states? Well, all three same can be either +1 or -1. So two states: (+1,+1,+1) and (-1,-1,-1).\n\nCase 2: Two spins same, one different. Let's think: how does this affect the sum.\n\nSuppose two are +1, one is -1. Let's say S3 is -1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1.\n\nWait, but in this case, sum is -1.\n\nWait, but wait, is that the only possibility? No, because depending on which spin is different, the sum can be -1, but maybe the number of +1 terms varies. Wait, let me calculate for a specific arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum for all possible states.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of how many terms in the sum are +1 and how many are -1.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to think about how many states have sum 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, sum=3: only two states as before.\n\nsum=-3: when all three are opposite. Wait, no, that's not possible because in three spins, you can't have all three pairs being opposite. Wait, for three spins, it's impossible to have all three pairs be opposite. Let me think: suppose S1 and S2 are opposite, S1 and S3 are opposite, then S2 and S3 must be same. Because S2 = -S1, S3 = -S1 \u2192 S2 = S3. So S2S3 = +1. So sum would be (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1. So in this case, sum is -1, not -3.\n\nSo the sum can't be -3. So the only possible sums are 3, 1, -1, but wait, can it be 1 or -1?\n\nWait, let's think about all possible cases.\n\nCase 1: All three same \u2192 sum=3. Number of states: 2.\n\nCase 2: All three different? No, because each spin can be only +1 or -1. So three spins can't all be different. Wait, but if you have two in one state and one in another, that's the case we considered earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about all possible spin configurations and compute their sums.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the number of +1 and -1 in the spin configuration.\n\nEach spin can be +1 or -1.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases based on the number of +1's:\n\n- All three are +1: sum = 3.\n\n- Two +1, one -1: Let's compute the sum.\n\nFor example, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = 1.\n\nS1S3 = -1.\n\nS2S3 = -1.\n\nSum = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nAnother example: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = -1.\n\nS1S3 = 1.\n\nS2S3 = -1.\n\nSum = (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nAnother example: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = -1.\n\nS1S3 = -1.\n\nS2S3=1.\n\nSum: -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nSo all three states with two +1's and one -1 have sum = -1.\n\nSimilarly, states with two -1's and one +1.\n\nWait, let's take S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = 1.\n\nS1S3 = -1.\n\nS2S3 = -1.\n\nSum = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nSame for any permutation.\n\nSo, for two +1 and one -1, sum is -1.\n\nSame for two -1 and one +1.\n\nSo how many states have sum=-1?\n\nEach such configuration has two +1's and one -1, which can happen in C(3,2) = 3 ways, and similarly for two -1's and one +1, which is another 3 states. So total of 6 states with sum=-1.\n\nWait, wait: two +1 and one -1: 3 states.\n\nTwo -1 and one +1: 3 states.\n\nSo 6 states in total with sum=-1.\n\nWait, but in each case, the sum is -1. So each of these 6 states contributes e^{-\u03b2 E} = e^{\u03b2 J (sum)} = e^{\u03b2 J (-1)} = e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nThen, what about the other two states (all +1 and all -1), which have sum=3. So each contributes e^{3\u03b2 J}.\n\nWait, but wait, are there any other possible sums? Let me check a state that might have sum=1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me take another configuration: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nThen S1S2 = -1.\n\nS1S3 = -1.\n\nS2S3=1.\n\nSum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nSo that's another state with sum=-1.\n\nWait, so how about the state where S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 \u2192 sum=3.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1 \u2192 sum=-1.\n\nWait, is there any state where the sum is 1?\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nWait, earlier calculation: sum=-1.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all possible states.\n\nAnother approach: Let me list all 8 states.\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1) \u2192 sum=3 \u2192 term e^{3\u03b2 J}.\n2.

(-1, +1, -1) \u2192 sum= -1 -1 +1 = -1 \u2192 term e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n7. (-1, -1, +1) \u2192 sum= 1 -1 -1 = -1 \u2192 term e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n8. (-1, -1, -1) \u2192 sum=3 \u2192 term e^{3\u03b2 J}.\n\nWait a second, so in all 8 states, the sum is either 3 (for states 1 and 8) or -1 (for states 2-7). So each of the 6 states 2-7 has sum=-1, and states 1 and 8 have sum=3.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when all three are the same, the sum is 3. For the other 6 states, the sum is -1. So each of those 6 contributes e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nSo the partition function Z is sum of all these terms.\n\nSo Z = [number of states with sum=3] * e^{3\u03b2 J} + [number of states with sum=-1] * e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nNumber of sum=3 states: 2 \u2192 each contributes e^{3\u03b2 J}.\n\nNumber of sum=-1 states: 6 \u2192 each contributes e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nSo Z = 2 e^{3\u03b2 J} + 6 e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, let me check.\n\nOption A: Z= 2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2) \u2192 no, because our sum is 2 e^{3\u03b2 J} +6 e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nOption B: Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2) +6e^(-J\u03b2) \u2192 yes, that matches.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nOption B: 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 which is what we have.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but wait the energy was given as E = -J (sum), so when sum is 3, E = -3J, so the term is exp( -\u03b2 E ) = exp(3 \u03b2 J), which is correct.\n\nSo the partition function is 2 e^{3 \u03b2 J} +6 e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Z= 2 e^{3J\u03b2}+6e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). \n\nWait, so each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I need to list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate the energy for each, then sum the exponentials of -\u03b2E.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the symmetry here. The energy depends on the product of pairs of spins. Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 will determine the energy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can categorize the states based on the number of aligned pairs. Wait, no, because each term is S_i S_j, so each term is +1 if the spins are the same, and -1 otherwise. So the sum can be 3 (all three pairs same), 1 (two same, one different), -1 (two different, one same), or -3 (all three pairs different).\n\nWait, let me think again. For three spins, each pair is either aligned or not. If all three spins are the same, say +1, then all S_i S_j are +1. So the sum is 3. Similarly, if all are -1, same thing. So E would be -J*(3) = -3J. \n\nIf two spins are the same and the third is opposite, let's say S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So the sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Then E = -J*(-1) = J. \n\nWait wait, no. Wait, the energy E is given by E = -J (sum). So for the sum being -1, E is -J*(-1) = J. So each state where the sum is -1 gives energy J.\n\nSimilarly, if the sum is +1, then E = -J*(1) = -J.\n\nWait, wait, let me correct that. Suppose the sum is 3, E is -3J. If the sum is 1, E is -J*(1) = -J. If the sum is -1, E is J. If the sum is -3, E is 3J.\n\nWait, no, because E = -J*(sum). So sum = 3 \u2192 E=-3J, sum=1 \u2192 E=-J, sum=-1 \u2192 E= J, sum=-3 \u2192 E=3J.\n\nSo each state will contribute exp(\u03b2E) = exp(\u03b2*(-J sum)).\n\nWait, no, because E is -J sum. So for each state, the exponent is -\u03b2 E = -\u03b2 (-J sum) = \u03b2 J sum.\n\nWait, but the partition function is the sum over all states of exp(-\u03b2 E). So for each state, the term is exp(\u03b2 J sum), because E is -J sum.\n\nHmm. So for each state, the term is e^{ \u03b2 J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3) }.\n\nWait, let me make a table of all possible spin states and their energies.\n\nTotal possible states: 8.\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 \u2192 S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 \u2192 sum=3 \u2192 E = -3J \u2192 term is e^{\u03b2*3J}.\n\nWait no, because E is -J sum. So term is exp(\u03b2 E) = exp( -\u03b2 (-3J) ) = e^{3 \u03b2 J}.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the partition function term is exp(-\u03b2 E). E is given by E = -J sum. So exp(-\u03b2 E) = exp(\u03b2 J sum).\n\nSo for sum=3: exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nsum=1: exp(1 \u03b2 J).\n\nsum=-1: exp(-1 \u03b2 J).\n\nsum=-3: exp(-3 \u03b2 J).\n\nNow, I need to find how many states have each sum.\n\nCase 1: All spins same \u2192 sum=3. How many such states? Well, all three same can be either +1 or -1. So two states: (+1,+1,+1) and (-1,-1,-1).\n\nCase 2: Two spins same, one different. Let's think: how does this affect the sum.\n\nSuppose two are +1, one is -1. Let's say S3 is -1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1.\n\nWait, but in this case, sum is -1.\n\nWait, but wait, is that the only possibility? No, because depending on which spin is different, the sum can be -1, but maybe the number of +1 terms varies. Wait, let me calculate for a specific arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum for all possible states.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of how many terms in the sum are +1 and how many are -1.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to think about how many states have sum 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, sum=3: only two states as before.\n\nsum=-3: when all three are opposite. Wait, no, that's not possible because in three spins, you can't have all three pairs being opposite. Wait, for three spins, it's impossible to have all three pairs be opposite. Let me think: suppose S1 and S2 are opposite, S1 and S3 are opposite, then S2 and S3 must be same. Because S2 = -S1, S3 = -S1 \u2192 S2 = S3. So S2S3 = +1. So sum would be (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1. So in this case, sum is -1, not -3.\n\nSo the sum can't be -3. So the only possible sums are 3, 1, -1, but wait, can it be 1 or -1?\n\nWait, let's think about all possible cases.\n\nCase 1: All three same \u2192 sum=3. Number of states: 2.\n\nCase 2: All three different? No, because each spin can be only +1 or -1. So three spins can't all be different. Wait, but if you have two in one state and one in another, that's the case we considered earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about all possible spin configurations and compute their sums.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the number of +1 and -1 in the spin configuration.\n\nEach spin can be +1 or -1.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases based on the number of +1's:\n\n- All three are +1: sum = 3.\n\n- Two +1, one -1: Let's compute the sum.\n\nFor example, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = 1.\n\nS1S3 = -1.\n\nS2S3 = -1.\n\nSum = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nAnother example: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = -1.\n\nS1S3 = 1.\n\nS2S3 = -1.\n\nSum = (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nAnother example: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = -1.\n\nS1S3 = -1.\n\nS2S3=1.\n\nSum: -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nSo all three states with two +1's and one -1 have sum = -1.\n\nSimilarly, states with two -1's and one +1.\n\nWait, let's take S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = 1.\n\nS1S3 = -1.\n\nS2S3 = -1.\n\nSum = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nSame for any permutation.\n\nSo, for two +1 and one -1, sum is -1.\n\nSame for two -1 and one +1.\n\nSo how many states have sum=-1?\n\nEach such configuration has two +1's and one -1, which can happen in C(3,2) = 3 ways, and similarly for two -1's and one +1, which is another 3 states. So total of 6 states with sum=-1.\n\nWait, wait: two +1 and one -1: 3 states.\n\nTwo -1 and one +1: 3 states.\n\nSo 6 states in total with sum=-1.\n\nWait, but in each case, the sum is -1. So each of these 6 states contributes e^{-\u03b2 E} = e^{\u03b2 J (sum)} = e^{\u03b2 J (-1)} = e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nThen, what about the other two states (all +1 and all -1), which have sum=3. So each contributes e^{3\u03b2 J}.\n\nWait, but wait, are there any other possible sums? Let me check a state that might have sum=1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me take another configuration: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nThen S1S2 = -1.\n\nS1S3 = -1.\n\nS2S3=1.\n\nSum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nSo that's another state with sum=-1.\n\nWait, so how about the state where S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 \u2192 sum=3.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1 \u2192 sum=-1.\n\nWait, is there any state where the sum is 1?\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nWait, earlier calculation: sum=-1.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all possible states.\n\nAnother approach: Let me list all 8 states.\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1) \u2192 sum=3 \u2192 term e^{3\u03b2 J}.\n2. (+1, +1, -1) \u2192 sum=1 -1 -1 = -1 \u2192 term e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n3. (+1, -1, +1) \u2192 sum= -1 +1 -1 = -1 \u2192 term e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n4. (+1, -1, -1) \u2192 sum= -1 -1 +1 = -1 \u2192 term e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n5. (-1, +1, +1) \u2192 sum= -1 +1 -1 = -1 \u2192 term e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n6. (-1, +1, -1) \u2192 sum= -1 -1 +1 = -1 \u2192 term e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n7. (-1, -1, +1) \u2192 sum= 1 -1 -1 = -1 \u2192 term e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n8. (-1, -1, -1) \u2192 sum=3 \u2192 term e^{3\u03b2 J}.\n\nWait a second, so in all 8 states, the sum is either 3 (for states 1 and 8) or -1 (for states 2-7). So each of the 6 states 2-7 has sum=-1, and states 1 and 8 have sum=3.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when all three are the same, the sum is 3. For the other 6 states, the sum is -1. So each of those 6 contributes e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nSo the partition function Z is sum of all these terms.\n\nSo Z = [number of states with sum=3] * e^{3\u03b2 J} + [number of states with sum=-1] * e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nNumber of sum=3 states: 2 \u2192 each contributes e^{3\u03b2 J}.\n\nNumber of sum=-1 states: 6 \u2192 each contributes e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nSo Z = 2 e^{3\u03b2 J} + 6 e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, let me check.\n\nOption A: Z= 2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2) \u2192 no, because our sum is 2 e^{3\u03b2 J} +6 e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nOption B: Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2) +6e^(-J\u03b2) \u2192 yes, that matches.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nOption B: 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 which is what we have.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but wait the energy was given as E = -J (sum), so when sum is 3, E = -3J, so the term is exp( -\u03b2 E ) = exp(3 \u03b2 J), which is correct.\n\nSo the partition function is 2 e^{3 \u03b2 J} +6 e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Z= 2 e^{3J\u03b2}+6e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n\nTo find the partition function \\( Z \\) for the system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\), and the energy is given by \\( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Energy Levels**:  \n   The energy depends on the sum \\( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \\), which can take the values \\( 3, 1, -1, -3 \\).  \n   - If all spins are the same (\\( +1, +1, +1 \\) or \\( -1, -1, -1 \\)), the sum is \\( 3 \\), and the energy is \\( E = -3J \\).  \n   - If two spins are the same and the third is opposite, the sum is \\( -1 \\), and the energy is \\( E = J \\).  \n   - The sum \\( 1 \\) and \\( -3 \\) do not occur for three spins due to symmetry constraints.\n\n2. **Partition Function**:  \n   The partition function is given by \\( Z = \\sum e^{-\\beta E} \\), where \\( \\beta = 1/(kT) \\).  \n   - For the two states with \\( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 3 \\), the contribution is \\( 2e^{3\\beta J} \\).  \n   - For the six states with \\( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \\), the contribution is \\( 6e^{-\\beta J} \\).  \n\n   Thus, \\( Z = 2e^{3\\beta J} + 6e^{-\\beta J} \\).\n\n3. **Matching with Options**:  \n   Comparing with the given options:  \n   - **Option A**: \\( Z = 2e^{-3J\\beta} + 6e^{J\\beta} \\) (incorrect, signs of exponents are reversed).  \n   - **Option B**: \\( Z = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta} \\) (correct, matches the derived expression).  \n   - **Option C**: \\( Z = 2e^{2J\\beta} + 6e^{-2J\\beta} \\) (incorrect, incorrect exponents).  \n   - **Option D**: \\( Z = 6e^{2J\\beta} + 2e^{-2J\\beta} \\) (incorrect, incorrect coefficients and exponents).  \n\nThe correct answer is **Option B**.  \n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this partition function problem. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the system has three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). And we need to find the partition function Z.\n\nWait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), right? Oh wait, no, actually, Z is the sum of exp(-\u03b2E) for each state. But wait, each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, how many total states are there? Each spin is either +1 or -1, so 2^3 = 8 states total.\n\nSo I need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible configurations and then sum exp(-\u03b2E) for each.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8. Let's think about the symmetry or possible groupings.\n\nThe energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's denote each term as S_i S_j. Each product S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1, right? Because each S is \u00b11. So S_i S_j is 1 if they're the same, -1 if different.\n\nWait, no, wait. S_i S_j is (1)(1)=1 if same, (1)(-1)=-1 if different. So each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be something like 3, 1, -1, -3? Hmm, let's think about possible values.\n\nWait, let's calculate the possible values of the sum:\n\nEach term is \u00b11. So the sum can be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1 and one -1), -1 (two -1 and one +1), or -3 (all -1). Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think about it:\n\nIf all three terms are +1, sum is 3.\n\nIf two are +1, one is -1: sum is 2 -1 = 1.\n\nIf one is +1, two are -1: sum is 1 -2 = -1.\n\nIf all three are -1: sum is -3.\n\nSo the possible sum values are 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nBut how many states correspond to each sum?\n\nLet me think. For three spins, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can take on these values. Let's find the number of states for each case.\n\nCase 1: All three terms are +1. That means S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Which implies all spins are the same. So S1 = S2 = S3. So either all +1 or all -1. So that's two states.\n\nCase 2: Sum is 1. That would be two terms +1 and one term -1. Let's see what that implies for the spins.\n\nEach term is S_i S_j. So for two terms being +1 and one -1, the product of all three terms is (+1)^2 * (-1) = -1. Wait, but the product of all three terms is (S1S2)(S1S3)(S2S3) = (S1^2 S2^2 S3^2) (since S1 appears in two terms). Wait, S1^2 is 1, so the product is 1. So (S1S2)(S1S3)(S2S3) = (S1 S2 S3)^2 = 1. So the product of the three terms is 1. But in case 2, the sum is 1. So the three terms have two +1 and one -1. So their product is (+1)^2 * (-1) = -1. But earlier, we found that their product is 1. So this is a contradiction. Wait, that can't happen. So maybe the sum can't be 1?\n\nHmm, that's confusing. So if the product of the three terms is 1, but in case 2, the product is -1. So that's impossible. So maybe the sum can't be 1. What does that mean?\n\nWait, let's reevaluate. Let me compute the product of the three terms (S1S2)(S1S3)(S2S3) = S1^2 S2^2 S3^2 (since each S is multiplied twice except for each pair). But each S is squared, so it's (1)(1)(1)=1. So the product of the three terms is 1. But in case 2, where two terms are +1 and one is -1, the product would be (+1)*(+1)*(-1) = -1, which contradicts the fact that the product must be +1. So that's impossible. So sum can't be 1. Similarly, let's check for sum being -1.\n\nIf sum is -1, that would be two terms -1 and one term +1. The product would be (-1)^2 * (+1) = +1, which matches the product being 1. So sum can be -1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum could be 3,1,-1,-3. But according to this, the sum can't be 1. So perhaps the possible sums are 3, -3, and -1?\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. For the sum to be 3, all three terms are +1, which requires all S_i the same. So two states (all +1 or all -1).\n\nWhat about the sum being -3? That would require all three terms to be -1. So S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Which implies that S1 = -S2, S1 = -S3, S2 = -S3. So all three spins are different from each other. Wait, but that's not possible because with three spins, each being \u00b11, you can't have all three being different. Because for three spins, you can have either all same, two same and one different, or all different. Wait, no, you can't have all three different with \u00b11. Because each is either +1 or -1, so for three spins, you can have either two +1 and one -1, or two -1 and one +1. So all three same is two states, and the other possibilities involve two same and one different.\n\nWait, so if all three terms are -1, that would require S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Let's see: S1 = -S2, S1 = -S3, so S2 = S3. But then S2S3 = S2^2 = 1, which can't be -1. So that's impossible. Therefore, the sum can't be -3. So only possible sums are 3, and -1.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when all three terms are -1, it's impossible. So sum can't be -3. So the possible sums are 3, -1, and what about other possibilities?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's suppose two terms are +1 and one is -1. Then their product is (+1)^2 * (-1) = -1. But earlier, we found that the product must be +1. So that's a contradiction. So that's impossible. So sum can't be 1. What about sum being -1? Let's see. Suppose two terms are -1 and one is +1. Then product is (-1)^2 * (+1) = +1. Which matches. So sum can be -1.\n\nSo possible sums are 3 and -1.\n\nWait, but wait, what about when sum is 3: all three terms +1. That's two states (all spins up or all down). What about sum being -1: two terms -1 and one term +1.\n\nWait, but how many states give sum -1? Let's see. Let's think of all possible spin configurations.\n\nEach spin can be +1 or -1. Let me list all 8 possibilities:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: E = -J [1+1+1] = -3J. So sum of terms is 3.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1: All terms +1. Sum is 3.\n\nSo from the 8 states, two of them have sum 3 (all same spins) and the other six have sum -1.\n\nSo that means the energies are:\n\nFor sum=3: E = -J * 3 \u2192 E = -3J.\n\nFor sum=-1: E = -J * (-1) \u2192 E = J.\n\nSo each state contributes a term to the partition function.\n\nNow, for each state with sum=3, energy is -3J. There are two such states. So their contribution to Z is 2 * exp(\u03b2 * 3J), because Z sums exp(-\u03b2 E), which is exp(\u03b2 *3J) for E=-3J.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because E is the energy, and the Boltzmann factor is exp(-\u03b2 E). So for E=-3J, it's exp(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nSimilarly, for E=J, each of the six states contributes exp(-\u03b2 * J) = exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nSo Z is sum of all these terms.\n\nSo Z = 2 * e^(3 \u03b2 J) + 6 * e^(-\u03b2 J).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is Z=2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6 e^(J\u03b2). That's the opposite of what I have here. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake. Wait, wait, no, let me double-check.\n\nWait, E = -J (sum terms). So when sum is 3, E = -3J. When sum is -1, E = J. So the energy is negative for sum=3, positive for sum=-1.\n\nThe partition function Z is sum exp(-\u03b2 E). So for E = -3J, exp(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = exp(3 \u03b2 J). For E = J, exp(-\u03b2*(J)) = exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nSo each of the two states with E=-3J contributes exp(3 \u03b2 J), and each of the six states with E=J contributes exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nSo Z = 2 e^{3 \u03b2 J} + 6 e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 2 e^{-3J\u03b2} +6 e^{J\u03b2} \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption B: 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 Yes, this matches.\n\nWait, but wait the options:\n\nOption A: Z=2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2)\nOption B: Z=2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nSo according to this, the correct Z is option B.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the math again. Because in the initial setup, the energy is E = -J (sum terms), so sum terms are either 3 or -1. So E is -3J when sum=3, and E= J when sum=-1.\n\nSo the Boltzmann factors are exp(-\u03b2 E) = exp(3 \u03b2 J) and exp(-\u03b2 J), respectively.\n\nYes, so Z = 2 e^{3 \u03b2 J} +6 e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nSo the correct option is B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this partition function problem. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the system has three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). And we need to find the partition function Z.\n\nWait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), right? Oh wait, no, actually, Z is the sum of exp(-\u03b2E) for each state. But wait, each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, how many total states are there? Each spin is either +1 or -1, so 2^3 = 8 states total.\n\nSo I need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible configurations and then sum exp(-\u03b2E) for each.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8. Let's think about the symmetry or possible groupings.\n\nThe energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's denote each term as S_i S_j. Each product S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1, right? Because each S is \u00b11. So S_i S_j is 1 if they're the same, -1 if different.\n\nWait, no, wait. S_i S_j is (1)(1)=1 if same, (1)(-1)=-1 if different. So each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be something like 3, 1, -1, -3? Hmm, let's think about possible values.\n\nWait, let's calculate the possible values of the sum:\n\nEach term is \u00b11. So the sum can be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1 and one -1), -1 (two -1 and one +1), or -3 (all -1). Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think about it:\n\nIf all three terms are +1, sum is 3.\n\nIf two are +1, one is -1: sum is 2 -1 = 1.\n\nIf one is +1, two are -1: sum is 1 -2 = -1.\n\nIf all three are -1: sum is -3.\n\nSo the possible sum values are 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nBut how many states correspond to each sum?\n\nLet me think. For three spins, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can take on these values. Let's find the number of states for each case.\n\nCase 1: All three terms are +1. That means S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Which implies all spins are the same. So S1 = S2 = S3. So either all +1 or all -1. So that's two states.\n\nCase 2: Sum is 1. That would be two terms +1 and one term -1. Let's see what that implies for the spins.\n\nEach term is S_i S_j. So for two terms being +1 and one -1, the product of all three terms is (+1)^2 * (-1) = -1. Wait, but the product of all three terms is (S1S2)(S1S3)(S2S3) = (S1^2 S2^2 S3^2) (since S1 appears in two terms). Wait, S1^2 is 1, so the product is 1. So (S1S2)(S1S3)(S2S3) = (S1 S2 S3)^2 = 1. So the product of the three terms is 1. But in case 2, the sum is 1. So the three terms have two +1 and one -1. So their product is (+1)^2 * (-1) = -1. But earlier, we found that their product is 1. So this is a contradiction. Wait, that can't happen. So maybe the sum can't be 1?\n\nHmm, that's confusing. So if the product of the three terms is 1, but in case 2, the product is -1. So that's impossible. So maybe the sum can't be 1. What does that mean?\n\nWait, let's reevaluate. Let me compute the product of the three terms (S1S2)(S1S3)(S2S3) = S1^2 S2^2 S3^2 (since each S is multiplied twice except for each pair). But each S is squared, so it's (1)(1)(1)=1. So the product of the three terms is 1. But in case 2, where two terms are +1 and one is -1, the product would be (+1)*(+1)*(-1) = -1, which contradicts the fact that the product must be +1. So that's impossible. So sum can't be 1. Similarly, let's check for sum being -1.\n\nIf sum is -1, that would be two terms -1 and one term +1. The product would be (-1)^2 * (+1) = +1, which matches the product being 1. So sum can be -1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum could be 3,1,-1,-3. But according to this, the sum can't be 1. So perhaps the possible sums are 3, -3, and -1?\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. For the sum to be 3, all three terms are +1, which requires all S_i the same. So two states (all +1 or all -1).\n\nWhat about the sum being -3? That would require all three terms to be -1. So S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Which implies that S1 = -S2, S1 = -S3, S2 = -S3. So all three spins are different from each other. Wait, but that's not possible because with three spins, each being \u00b11, you can't have all three being different. Because for three spins, you can have either all same, two same and one different, or all different. Wait, no, you can't have all three different with \u00b11. Because each is either +1 or -1, so for three spins, you can have either two +1 and one -1, or two -1 and one +1. So all three same is two states, and the other possibilities involve two same and one different.\n\nWait, so if all three terms are -1, that would require S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Let's see: S1 = -S2, S1 = -S3, so S2 = S3. But then S2S3 = S2^2 = 1, which can't be -1. So that's impossible. Therefore, the sum can't be -3. So only possible sums are 3, and -1.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when all three terms are -1, it's impossible. So sum can't be -3. So the possible sums are 3, -1, and what about other possibilities?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's suppose two terms are +1 and one is -1. Then their product is (+1)^2 * (-1) = -1. But earlier, we found that the product must be +1. So that's a contradiction. So that's impossible. So sum can't be 1. What about sum being -1? Let's see. Suppose two terms are -1 and one is +1. Then product is (-1)^2 * (+1) = +1. Which matches. So sum can be -1.\n\nSo possible sums are 3 and -1.\n\nWait, but wait, what about when sum is 3: all three terms +1. That's two states (all spins up or all down). What about sum being -1: two terms -1 and one term +1.\n\nWait, but how many states give sum -1? Let's see. Let's think of all possible spin configurations.\n\nEach spin can be +1 or -1. Let me list all 8 possibilities:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: E = -J [1+1+1] = -3J. So sum of terms is 3.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1: All terms +1. Sum is 3.\n\nSo from the 8 states, two of them have sum 3 (all same spins) and the other six have sum -1.\n\nSo that means the energies are:\n\nFor sum=3: E = -J * 3 \u2192 E = -3J.\n\nFor sum=-1: E = -J * (-1) \u2192 E = J.\n\nSo each state contributes a term to the partition function.\n\nNow, for each state with sum=3, energy is -3J. There are two such states. So their contribution to Z is 2 * exp(\u03b2 * 3J), because Z sums exp(-\u03b2 E), which is exp(\u03b2 *3J) for E=-3J.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because E is the energy, and the Boltzmann factor is exp(-\u03b2 E). So for E=-3J, it's exp(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nSimilarly, for E=J, each of the six states contributes exp(-\u03b2 * J) = exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nSo Z is sum of all these terms.\n\nSo Z = 2 * e^(3 \u03b2 J) + 6 * e^(-\u03b2 J).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is Z=2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6 e^(J\u03b2). That's the opposite of what I have here. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake. Wait, wait, no, let me double-check.\n\nWait, E = -J (sum terms). So when sum is 3, E = -3J. When sum is -1, E = J. So the energy is negative for sum=3, positive for sum=-1.\n\nThe partition function Z is sum exp(-\u03b2 E). So for E = -3J, exp(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = exp(3 \u03b2 J).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about finding the partition function Z for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on partition functions, but I'll try to think this through.\n\nFirst, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). So I need to find all possible states of the three spins and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-\u03b2E) for all states.\n\nEach spin has two possible states: +1 and -1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them out.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8. Because the energy depends on the products S_i S_j. So perhaps I can find the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of each term S_i S_j. Each S_i is either +1 or -1, so S_i S_j is +1 if the two spins are the same, and -1 if they're different.\n\nSo each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. But when you add three such terms together, what are the possible sums?\n\nWait, let's see. The maximum sum would be if all three terms are +1. Then sum is 3. The minimum would be if all are -1, sum is -3. But wait, is that possible? Let's check.\n\nBut wait, for three spins, can all three pairs S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 be +1? Let me see.\n\nSuppose S1 = S2 = S3 = +1. Then all three products are +1. So sum is 3. Similarly, if all are -1, then each product is +1 again. Oh wait, because (-1)*(-1) is +1. So in that case, the sum is 3.\n\nHmm, but what about other possibilities. Let's say S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1. Then S1S2 is +1, S1S3 is -1, S2S3 is -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, but I think the sum can only take certain values. Let's think about all possible cases.\n\nAnother approach: The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be rewritten. Let me see: since S1, S2, S3 are each \u00b11, perhaps there's a way to express this sum in terms of the sum of the spins.\n\nWait, let me compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Expanding that, we get S1\u00b2 + S2\u00b2 + S3\u00b2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since S_i\u00b2 is 1 for each spin, the expansion becomes 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So,\n\n(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = 3 + 2(sum of S_i S_j )\n\nSo sum of S_i S_j = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ] / 2\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the possible values of the sum.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me call this sum H for simplicity.\n\nSo H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nEach term is \u00b11, so the sum can be:\n\n- All three terms are 1: sum H=3.\n\n- Two terms 1, one term -1: sum is 1.\n\n- One term 1, two terms -1: sum is -1.\n\n- All three terms -1: sum is -3.\n\nWait, but is that possible? Let me check for each case.\n\nCase 1: H=3. As before, this occurs when all three spins are the same.\n\nCase 2: H=1. Let's see if that's possible.

So that's the case.\n\nSo the energy E is given by E= -J H, where H can be 3 or -1.\n\nSo for each state, E is either -J*(3) or -J*(-1) = J.\n\nSo for the two states where H=3, E = -3J.\n\nFor the other six states, H=-1, so E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, no, wait.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about finding the partition function Z for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on partition functions, but I'll try to think this through.\n\nFirst, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). So I need to find all possible states of the three spins and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-\u03b2E) for all states.\n\nEach spin has two possible states: +1 and -1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them out.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8. Because the energy depends on the products S_i S_j. So perhaps I can find the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of each term S_i S_j. Each S_i is either +1 or -1, so S_i S_j is +1 if the two spins are the same, and -1 if they're different.\n\nSo each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. But when you add three such terms together, what are the possible sums?\n\nWait, let's see. The maximum sum would be if all three terms are +1. Then sum is 3. The minimum would be if all are -1, sum is -3. But wait, is that possible? Let's check.\n\nBut wait, for three spins, can all three pairs S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 be +1? Let me see.\n\nSuppose S1 = S2 = S3 = +1. Then all three products are +1. So sum is 3. Similarly, if all are -1, then each product is +1 again. Oh wait, because (-1)*(-1) is +1. So in that case, the sum is 3.\n\nHmm, but what about other possibilities. Let's say S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1. Then S1S2 is +1, S1S3 is -1, S2S3 is -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, but I think the sum can only take certain values. Let's think about all possible cases.\n\nAnother approach: The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be rewritten. Let me see: since S1, S2, S3 are each \u00b11, perhaps there's a way to express this sum in terms of the sum of the spins.\n\nWait, let me compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Expanding that, we get S1\u00b2 + S2\u00b2 + S3\u00b2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since S_i\u00b2 is 1 for each spin, the expansion becomes 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So,\n\n(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = 3 + 2(sum of S_i S_j )\n\nSo sum of S_i S_j = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ] / 2\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the possible values of the sum.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me call this sum H for simplicity.\n\nSo H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nEach term is \u00b11, so the sum can be:\n\n- All three terms are 1: sum H=3.\n\n- Two terms 1, one term -1: sum is 1.\n\n- One term 1, two terms -1: sum is -1.\n\n- All three terms -1: sum is -3.\n\nWait, but is that possible? Let me check for each case.\n\nCase 1: H=3. As before, this occurs when all three spins are the same.\n\nCase 2: H=1. Let's see if that's possible. For example, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nThen S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum H=1 -1 -1= -1. Wait, that's -1. Hmm, so that's not 1. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, another example: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum H= -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nHmm, maybe another arrangement. Let's see: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: H=3.\n\nS1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: H =1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nWait, but I'm not getting H=1. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the possible values. Maybe H can only be 3, 1, -1, -3? Or perhaps other possibilities.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute all possible H values for all 8 states.\n\nEach state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.\n\nLet me list all 8 states and compute H for each.\n\n1.

So that's the case.\n\nSo the energy E is given by E= -J H, where H can be 3 or -1.\n\nSo for each state, E is either -J*(3) or -J*(-1) = J.\n\nSo for the two states where H=3, E = -3J.\n\nFor the other six states, H=-1, so E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, no, wait.

So if H=3, E= -3J * (1) \u2192 E = -3J.\n\nIf H=-1, E= -J*(-1) = J.\n\nSo each state contributes a term exp(-\u03b2 E) to the partition function.\n\nSo for the two states with H=3, E=-3J, so exp(-\u03b2*(-3J))= exp(3J\u03b2).\n\nEach of these two states contributes exp(3J\u03b2).\n\nFor the other six states, E=J, so exp(-\u03b2*J) = exp(-J\u03b2).\n\nEach of these six states contributes exp(-J\u03b2).\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states: 2 * exp(3J\u03b2) + 6 * exp(-J\u03b2).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, let me check.\n\nOption A: 2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6 e^(J\u03b2).
