      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. I've heard that expectation values are like the average outcome if you measured something many times. Right.\n\nThe particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. Wait, wait, spin-up and spin-down are eigenstates of sigma_z, which I think is the Pauli z matrix. So sigma_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 respectively.\n\nThe operator we're supposed to find the expectation value of is 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x. Oh, okay. So I need to compute the expectation value of each term separately and then add them together. Because expectation values are linear, right? So \u27e8A + B\u27e9 = \u27e8A\u27e9 + \u27e8B\u27e9.\n\nLet me break it down. First, let's find \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9. Since the state is a linear combination of \u03c3_z eigenstates, this should be straightforward. The state is \u03c8 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. Wait, does that make sense? Let me check the normalization. The sum of squares of the coefficients should be 1. So 0.5\u00b2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. Adding them gives 1, so it's normalized. Good.\n\nFor \u03c3_z, the expectation value is |a|\u00b2 * (+1) + |b|\u00b2 * (-1). Because when you measure \u03c3_z, you get +1 with probability |a|\u00b2 and -1 with |b|\u00b2. So let's compute that.\n\n|a|\u00b2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|\u00b2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4, which is 0.75. So \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Got that.\n\nNow, the operator has 10\u03c3_z, so the expectation for that term would be 10 * \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 = 10*(-0.5) = -5. Okay.\n\nNext, the \u03c3_x part. \u03c3_x is the Pauli x matrix. I remember that \u03c3_x doesn't have the same eigenstates as \u03c3_z. So I can't directly compute \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 the same way. Hmm. I think I need to compute it using the expectation value formula, which involves the state \u03c8.\n\nThe expectation value of \u03c3_x is given by \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3_x \u03c8. Let's write out the components. Since \u03c8 is a two-component spinor, let me represent it as a column vector. |\u2191\u27e9 is (1, 0) and |\u2193\u27e9 is (0, 1). So \u03c8 would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\n\u03c3_x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So let's compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3_x \u03c8. Wait, \u03c8 is a row vector, so \u03c8\u2020 is the conjugate transpose. Since all coefficients are real here, \u03c8\u2020 is just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3_x \u03c8 = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]\n\nLet me compute the matrix multiplication step by step. First, multiply \u03c3_x with \u03c8.\n\n\u03c3_x \u03c8 = [[0*0.5 +1*(sqrt(3)/2)], [1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)]] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.\n\nNow, multiply \u03c8\u2020 with that result. So [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.\n\nCompute each element:\n\n0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, the 5\u03c3_x term's expectation is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 5 * 0.866 \u2248 4.33.\n\nNow, adding the two expectation values: 10\u03c3_z term is -5, and 5\u03c3_x term is approximately 4.33. So total expectation value is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more accurately. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.8660. So 5 * 0.8660 is 4.330.\n\nAdding -5 and 4.33 gives -0.66999..., which is approximately -0.67. But wait, the options are given up to one decimal. So that would be -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The exact value of \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2. So 5 times that is (5 sqrt(3))/2 \u2248 (5 * 1.732)/2 \u2248 8.66/2 = 4.33.\n\nSo total expectation value: 10\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5 * 1.732)/2.\n\nWait, 5*1.732 is 8.66, divided by 2 is 4.33. So -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which when rounded to one decimal is -0.7. So looking at the options, option C is -0.7.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nFirst, the coefficients: 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Their squares are 0.25 and 0.75, correct.\n\nFor \u03c3_z expectation: 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So 10\u03c3_z gives -5.\n\nFor \u03c3_x, I computed \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3_x \u03c8. Let me verify that again.\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. \u03c8 is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So \u03c3_x \u03c8 is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then, [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by this gives (0.5*sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) )= (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) * 2 = sqrt(3)/2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo 5 times that is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) \u22484.33. Adding to -5 gives -0.67, which is approximately -0.7. So the expectation is -0.7, which is option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. The states |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are the eigenstates of \u03c3z. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z + 5\u03c3x. The options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.\n\nHmm, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome you'd expect from measuring that observable on a large number of identical systems. So for a given state, the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula \u27e8\u03c8|\u00d4|\u03c8\u27e9, where \u00d4 is the operator and |\u03c8\u27e9 is the state vector.\n\nThe given state is \u03c8 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. Since \u03c3z has eigenstates |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, those are the basis states here. Let me write down the components of the state. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Wait, let me check: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 should equal 1. Because probabilities should add up. 0.25 + (3/4) = 1, yes. So the state is properly normalized.\n\nThe operator given is 10\u03c3z + 5\u03c3x. Since expectation values are linear, I can split this into two parts: 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 + 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. So I can compute each expectation separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9. Since \u03c3z is diagonal in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis, it's easy. The matrix for \u03c3z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The expectation value \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.\n\nThe state \u03c8 is a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, where a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. So the probability of |\u2191\u27e9 is |a|^2 = 0.25, and |b|^2 = (3/4). The eigenvalues for \u03c3z are +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So the first term is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.\n\nNow for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the states |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9. Its matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. But wait, how do I compute the expectation value of \u03c3x for a given state?\n\nAlternatively, I remember that \u03c3x can be written in terms of the spin states. Let me think: when you have a state |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 2 times the real part of the product of a and the conjugate of b. Wait, no, maybe it's 2 times (a b* + a* b) divided by something? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the matrix representation. Let me construct the matrix for \u03c3x, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Then, the expectation value is \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nWait, \u03c8 is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], but I think the conjugate transpose. Since the coefficients are real, it's just the transpose.\n\nSo, let me compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nSo \u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Let me compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by \u03c3x. Let's compute that matrix multiplication.\n\n\u03c3x is:\nRow 1: 0, 1\nRow 2: 1, 0\n\nSo when you multiply \u03c8\u2020 (which is a 1x2 matrix) by \u03c3x (2x2), you get a 1x2 matrix.\n\nSo first element: 0.5*0 + (sqrt(3)/2)*1 = sqrt(3)/2\nSecond element: 0.5*1 + (sqrt(3)/2)*0 = 0.5\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nNow multiply this by \u03c8, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo the expectation value is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nLet me compute that: (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) is sqrt(3)/4, and the second term is also sqrt(3)/4. Adding them together gives sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660... So approximately 0.866.\n\nWait, wait, I think I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the multiplication is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] multiplied by [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo the first term is (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = sqrt(3)/4.\n\nThe second term is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4.\n\nSo sum is sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2. So yes, about 0.866.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo the second term is 5 * 0.8660 \u2248 5 * 0.8660 = 4.330.\n\nSo putting it all together, the expectation value is 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = (-5) + (4.330) = -0.67.\n\nWait, wait, that gives me approximately -0.67. Looking at the options, none of the options match exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA) -1.4\nB) 1.65\nC) -0.7\nD) 0.85\n\nHmm. My calculation gives -0.67, which is close to option C (-0.7). But perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nLet me think again about how to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The expectation value of \u03c3x for a state \u03c8 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nThe formula for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is (a b* + a* b) * 2. Because \u03c3x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but it's not diagonal. Wait, no, the expectation value is 2 Re(ab^*).\n\nWait, let me think again. Because \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9 and \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nSo, \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 = (a* \u27e8\u2191| + b* \u27e8\u2193|) \u03c3x (a |\u2191\u27e9 + b |\u2193\u27e9 )\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= a* a \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + a* b \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 + b* a \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + b* b \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nWe know that \u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9 and \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9. So:\n\n\u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 = 0.\n\u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 =1.\nSimilarly, \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 =1.\n\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 = 0.\n\nSo putting that in:\n\n= a*a *0 + a*b *1 + b*a *1 + b*b *0\n\n= a b + b a = 2 Re(a b^*).\n\nSince in this case, a and b are real numbers (0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, respectively), so Re(ab^*) = ab.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2 a b.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\na = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) * 2 = (sqrt(3)/4) * 2 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, same result as before. So my calculation was correct.\n\nSo the expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = (-5) + (4.33) = -0.67.\n\nBut the options don't have -0.67, but option C is -0.7, which is close.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9.\n\nWait, \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is (0.5)^2 *1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1).\n\n0.25 *1 = 0.25.\n\n(3/4)*(-1) = -0.75.\n\nSo 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the expectation value is 10*(-0.5)= -5, plus 5*(0.866)=4.33. So sum is -0.67.\n\nWait, but the options are up to one decimal place. So -0.67 rounds to -0.7. So option C is -0.7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute more precisely.\n\nLet me compute the exact value.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866025.\n\nSo 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 5 * 0.866025 = 4.330125.\n\nSo the total is -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.\n\nWhich is approximately -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So option C is correct.\n\nWait, but another approach: maybe the operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x, so perhaps I should compute each part separately.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the operator. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what's the matrix for \u03c3x? Let me double-check that.\n\n\u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]], yes.\n\nSo the calculation of \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 should be correct.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7, so the answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the operator differently. Let me think about it in terms of the state.\n\nWait, the state is \u03c8 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nAnother approach to compute the expectation value is to write \u03c8 as a vector and multiply by the operator matrix.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Since I've already got the expectation value as approximately -0.7, which is option C, I think that's the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. The states |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are the eigenstates of \u03c3z. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z + 5\u03c3x. The options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.\n\nHmm, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome you'd expect from measuring that observable on a large number of identical systems. So for a given state, the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula \u27e8\u03c8|\u00d4|\u03c8\u27e9, where \u00d4 is the operator and |\u03c8\u27e9 is the state vector.\n\nThe given state is \u03c8 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. Since \u03c3z has eigenstates |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, those are the basis states here. Let me write down the components of the state. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Wait, let me check: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 should equal 1. Because probabilities should add up. 0.25 + (3/4) = 1, yes. So the state is properly normalized.\n\nThe operator given is 10\u03c3z + 5\u03c3x. Since expectation values are linear, I can split this into two parts: 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 + 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. So I can compute each expectation separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9. Since \u03c3z is diagonal in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis, it's easy. The matrix for \u03c3z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The expectation value \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.\n\nThe state \u03c8 is a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, where a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. So the probability of |\u2191\u27e9 is |a|^2 = 0.25, and |b|^2 = (3/4). The eigenvalues for \u03c3z are +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So the first term is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.\n\nNow for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the states |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9. Its matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. But wait, how do I compute the expectation value of \u03c3x for a given state?\n\nAlternatively, I remember that \u03c3x can be written in terms of the spin states. Let me think: when you have a state |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 2 times the real part of the product of a and the conjugate of b. Wait, no, maybe it's 2 times (a b* + a* b) divided by something? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the matrix representation. Let me construct the matrix for \u03c3x, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Then, the expectation value is \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nWait, \u03c8 is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], but I think the conjugate transpose. Since the coefficients are real, it's just the transpose.\n\nSo, let me compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nSo \u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Let me compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by \u03c3x. Let's compute that matrix multiplication.\n\n\u03c3x is:\nRow 1: 0, 1\nRow 2: 1, 0\n\nSo when you multiply \u03c8\u2020 (which is a 1x2 matrix) by \u03c3x (2x2), you get a 1x2 matrix.\n\nSo first element: 0.5*0 + (sqrt(3)/2)*1 = sqrt(3)/2\nSecond element: 0.5*1 + (sqrt(3)/2)*0 = 0.5\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nNow multiply this by \u03c8, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo the expectation value is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nLet me compute that: (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) is sqrt(3)/4, and the second term is also sqrt(3)/4. Adding them together gives sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660... So approximately 0.866.\n\nWait, wait, I think I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the multiplication is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] multiplied by [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo the first term is (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = sqrt(3)/4.\n\nThe second term is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4.\n\nSo sum is sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2. So yes, about 0.866.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo the second term is 5 * 0.8660 \u2248 5 * 0.8660 = 4.330.\n\nSo putting it all together, the expectation value is 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = (-5) + (4.330) = -0.67.\n\nWait, wait, that gives me approximately -0.67. Looking at the options, none of the options match exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA) -1.4\nB) 1.65\nC) -0.7\nD) 0.85\n\nHmm. My calculation gives -0.67, which is close to option C (-0.7). But perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nLet me think again about how to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The expectation value of \u03c3x for a state \u03c8 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nThe formula for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is (a b* + a* b) * 2. Because \u03c3x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but it's not diagonal. Wait, no, the expectation value is 2 Re(ab^*).\n\nWait, let me think again. Because \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9 and \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nSo, \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 = (a* \u27e8\u2191| + b* \u27e8\u2193|) \u03c3x (a |\u2191\u27e9 + b |\u2193\u27e9 )\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= a* a \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + a* b \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 + b* a \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + b* b \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nWe know that \u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9 and \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9. So:\n\n\u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 = 0.\n\u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 =1.\nSimilarly, \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 =1.\n\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 = 0.\n\nSo putting that in:\n\n= a*a *0 + a*b *1 + b*a *1 + b*b *0\n\n= a b + b a = 2 Re(a b^*).\n\nSince in this case, a and b are real numbers (0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, respectively), so Re(ab^*) = ab.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2 a b.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\na = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) * 2 = (sqrt(3)/4) * 2 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, same result as before. So my calculation was correct.\n\nSo the expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = (-5) + (4.33) = -0.67.\n\nBut the options don't have -0.67, but option C is -0.7, which is close.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9.\n\nWait, \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is (0.5)^2 *1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1).\n\n0.25 *1 = 0.25.\n\n(3/4)*(-1) = -0.75.\n\nSo 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the expectation value is 10*(-0.5)= -5, plus 5*(0.866)=4.33. So sum is -0.67.\n\nWait, but the options are up to one decimal place. So -0.67 rounds to -0.7. So option C is -0.7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute more precisely.\n\nLet me compute the exact value.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866025.\n\nSo 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 5 * 0.866025 = 4.330125.\n\nSo the total is -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.\n\nWhich is approximately -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So option C is correct.\n\nWait, but another approach: maybe the operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x, so perhaps I should compute each part separately.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the operator. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what's the matrix for \u03c3x? Let me double-check that.\n\n\u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]], yes.\n\nSo the calculation of \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 should be correct.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7, so the answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the operator differently. Let me think about it in terms of the state.\n\nWait, the state is \u03c8 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nAnother approach to compute the expectation value is to write \u03c8 as a vector and multiply by the operator matrix.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Since I've already got the expectation value as approximately -0.7, which is option C, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) for the given spin-half particle in the state \\( \\psi = 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle \\). The expectation value is computed as \\( \\langle \\psi | (10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x) | \\psi \\rangle \\), which can be split into two parts: \\( 10\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle + 5\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle \\).\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( \\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle \\)\nThe eigenstates \\( |\\uparrow\\rangle \\) and \\( |\\downarrow\\rangle \\) correspond to eigenvalues \\( +1 \\) and \\( -1 \\) for \\( \\sigma_z \\), respectively. The state \\( \\psi \\) has coefficients \\( a = 0.5 \\) for \\( |\\uparrow\\rangle \\) and \\( b = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\) for \\( |\\downarrow\\rangle \\). The probabilities are \\( |a|^2 = 0.25 \\) and \\( |b|^2 = 0.75 \\). Thus:\n\\[\n\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\\]\nThe contribution to the expectation value from \\( 10\\sigma_z \\) is:\n\\[\n10\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute \\( \\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle \\)\nThe operator \\( \\sigma_x \\) swaps the states \\( |\\uparrow\\rangle \\) and \\( |\\downarrow\\rangle \\). For a state \\( \\psi = a|\\uparrow\\rangle + b|\\downarrow\\rangle \\), the expectation value of \\( \\sigma_x \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle = 2 \\, \\text{Re}(ab^*).\n\\]\nSince \\( a = 0.5 \\) and \\( b = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\) are real, this simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle = 2ab = 2(0.5)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\sqrt{3}/2 \\approx 0.866.\n\\]\nThe contribution to the expectation value from \\( 5\\sigma_x \\) is:\n\\[\n5\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle = 5(0.866) \\approx 4.33.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine Results\nThe total expectation value is:\n\\[\n\\langle 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\rangle = 10\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle + 5\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.\n\\]\nRounding to one decimal place, the result is approximately \\( -0.7 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe closest option to the computed value is **C) -0.7**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving sigma_z and sigma_x. The particle is in a specific superposition state.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The state is given as 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. Wait, wait, I should check if that's a normalized state. Let me compute the square of the coefficients. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which is 0.75. Adding them gives 1, so yes, it's normalized. Good.\n\nThe operator in question is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. The expectation value is the sum of the expectation values of each term, right? So, \u27e810\u03c3z +5\u03c3x\u27e9 = 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. That's because expectation values are linear, so the expectation of a sum is the sum of the expectations, and constants can be pulled out.\n\nSo first, I need to find \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nSince |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, that should make finding \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 easier. Let me recall that \u03c3z|\u2191\u27e9 = +1|\u2191\u27e9 and \u03c3z|\u2193\u27e9 = -1|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is the probability of being in |\u2191\u27e9 times (+1) plus the probability of being in |\u2193\u27e9 times (-1). Because the state is a linear combination, the coefficients give the amplitudes, and the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values.\n\nSo, the state is (0.5)|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. The probability for |\u2191\u27e9 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The probability for |\u2193\u27e9 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\nNow, for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, that's a bit trickier. Because \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the spin states. The eigenstates of \u03c3x are not |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, so I can't directly use them. Instead, I need to compute the expectation value using the state.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is given by \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9, where |\u03c8\u27e9 is the state. Let me compute this.\n\nExpressing \u03c3x as a matrix might help. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when acting on the state |\u2191\u27e9, which is [1,0]^T, \u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = [0,1]^T = |\u2193\u27e9. Similarly, \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nSo, let's compute \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nThe state |\u03c8\u27e9 is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9, so the bra vector is 0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193|.\n\nSo, \u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5 \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2) \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 = 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9.\n\nNow, \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 is the inner product of \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x with |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nSo, \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 = [0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| ] [0.5|\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 ]\n\nWait, no, actually, the order is a bit different. Let me compute each term:\n\nWait, no, let's expand this properly. When you compute \u27e8a| (B|b\u27e9), where a and b are states and B is an operator, you take the inner product of a with B|b\u27e9.\n\nSo, \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 is 0.5\u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 + 0.5\u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nWait, no, perhaps a better approach is to compute the inner product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute it as a matrix product. Let me write |\u03c8\u27e9 as a column vector. Since |\u2191\u27e9 is [1,0]^T and |\u2193\u27e9 is [0,1]^T, then |\u03c8\u27e9 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\n\u03c3x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], so \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8\u27e9 multiplied by \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nWait, since all coefficients are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose.\n\nSo, |\u03c8\u27e9^T is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nMultiply by \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9: [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nSo the inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 0.5 is 1/2, sqrt(3)/2 is same. So each term is (1/2)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. There are two such terms, so total is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I compute the matrix product, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the inner product is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.\n\nSo it's (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 2 * (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, that's the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. So approximately 0.866.\n\nBut wait, another approach: because the expectation value of \u03c3x for a spin in a state |\u03b8, \u03c6\u27e9 is sin(2\u03b8) cos \u03c6? Wait, maybe that's for a different basis. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nWait, maybe I can write the state in terms of eigenstates of \u03c3x. The eigenstates of \u03c3x are (|\u2191\u27e9 + |\u2193\u27e9)/sqrt(2) and (|\u2191\u27e9 - |\u2193\u27e9)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value as I did before.\n\nSo, from the calculation, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the state is mostly in the |\u2193\u27e9 state, but with a component in |\u2191\u27e9. So the expectation value of \u03c3x, which measures the expectation in the x-direction, would be positive because the state has more weight in |\u2193\u27e9, which is the -z direction. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value using the matrix approach correctly.\n\nWait, let's do that again.\n\nThe state |\u03c8\u27e9 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\n\u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]].\n\nSo \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.\n\nThen \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is the dot product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nSo 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.\n\nSo each term is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 \u2248 0.433.\n\nAdding both gives sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Because another way to compute expectation value is using the probabilities. Hmm, perhaps not, because \u03c3x doesn't have the same eigenstates as \u03c3z.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x.\n\nSo expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nCompute each part:\n\n10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\n5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5*1.732)/2 \u2248 (8.66)/2 \u22484.33.\n\nSo sum is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205080757.\n\nSo sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866025403785.\n\nSo 5*(0.866025403785) = 4.330127018925.\n\nThen 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\nSo total is (-5) + 4.330127 \u2248 -0.669873.\n\nRounded to one decimal place, that would be -0.7.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is -0.7.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, the state is 0.5 |\u2191> + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193>.\n\nSo when I computed \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9, I got -0.5, which is correct.\n\nFor \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, I got sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866, which seems correct based on the matrix calculation.\n\nSo 10*(-0.5) = -5, 5*(sqrt(3)/2) \u22485*(0.866) \u22484.33. So -5 +4.33= -0.67, which rounds to -0.7.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) -1.4\n\nB)1.65\n\nC)-0.7\n\nD)0.85\n\nSo option C is -0.7, which matches our calculation.\n\nHmm, but I should make sure I didn't make any mistake in the \u03c3x expectation value. Let me think again.\n\nAnother way to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is to write the state in terms of the eigenstates of \u03c3x. The eigenstates of \u03c3x are |+x\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 + |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2 and |\u2212x\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 \u2212 |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nExpressing |\u03c8\u27e9 in terms of |+x\u27e9 and |\u2212x\u27e9.\n\nLet me write |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|+x\u27e9 + b|\u2212x\u27e9.\n\nSo, solving for a and b.\n\nWe have:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 + |\u2193\u27e9)/(\u221a2) * a + (|\u2191\u27e9 \u2212 |\u2193\u27e9)/(\u221a2) * b.\n\nGrouping terms:\n\n= [ (a + b)|\u2191\u27e9 + (a \u2212 b)|\u2193\u27e9 ] / \u221a2.\n\nBut |\u03c8\u27e9 is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nSo,\n\n(a + b)/\u221a2 = 0.5,\n\n(a \u2212 b)/\u221a2 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nMultiply both equations by \u221a2:\n\na + b = 0.5 * \u221a2 \u2248 0.7071,\n\na - b = (sqrt(3)/2) * \u221a2 = sqrt(6)/2 \u2248 1.2247.\n\nNow, solving for a and b.\n\nAdding the two equations:\n\n2a = 0.7071 +1.2247 \u22481.9318 \u2192 a\u22480.9659.\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\n2b = 0.7071 -1.2247 \u2248-0.5176 \u2192 b\u2248-0.2588.\n\nNow, the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is |a|^2 \u2212 |b|^2.\n\nBecause \u03c3x has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+x\u27e9 and |\u2212x\u27e9.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1) = (|a|^2 \u2212 |b|^2).\n\nCompute |a|^2 and |b|^2.\n\na \u22480.9659 \u2192 |a|^2 \u2248 (0.9659)^2 \u22480.933.\n\nb \u2248-0.2588 \u2192 |b|^2 \u2248 (0.2588)^2 \u22480.06698.\n\nSo, |a|^2 \u2212 |b|^2 \u22480.933 \u22120.06698 \u22480.866, which matches our previous result of sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660. So this confirms that \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is correct.\n\nSo, the expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.8660) = -5 +4.330= -0.6698, which rounds to -0.7. So the correct option is C) -0.7.\n",

Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving sigma_z and sigma_x. The particle is in a specific superposition state.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The state is given as 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. Wait, wait, I should check if that's a normalized state. Let me compute the square of the coefficients. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which is 0.75. Adding them gives 1, so yes, it's normalized. Good.\n\nThe operator in question is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. The expectation value is the sum of the expectation values of each term, right? So, \u27e810\u03c3z +5\u03c3x\u27e9 = 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. That's because expectation values are linear, so the expectation of a sum is the sum of the expectations, and constants can be pulled out.\n\nSo first, I need to find \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nSince |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, that should make finding \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 easier. Let me recall that \u03c3z|\u2191\u27e9 = +1|\u2191\u27e9 and \u03c3z|\u2193\u27e9 = -1|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is the probability of being in |\u2191\u27e9 times (+1) plus the probability of being in |\u2193\u27e9 times (-1). Because the state is a linear combination, the coefficients give the amplitudes, and the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values.\n\nSo, the state is (0.5)|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. The probability for |\u2191\u27e9 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The probability for |\u2193\u27e9 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\nNow, for \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, that's a bit trickier. Because \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the spin states. The eigenstates of \u03c3x are not |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, so I can't directly use them. Instead, I need to compute the expectation value using the state.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is given by \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9, where |\u03c8\u27e9 is the state. Let me compute this.\n\nExpressing \u03c3x as a matrix might help. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when acting on the state |\u2191\u27e9, which is [1,0]^T, \u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = [0,1]^T = |\u2193\u27e9. Similarly, \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nSo, let's compute \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nThe state |\u03c8\u27e9 is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9, so the bra vector is 0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193|.\n\nSo, \u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5 \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2) \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 = 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9.\n\nNow, \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 is the inner product of \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x with |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nSo, \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 = [0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| ] [0.5|\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 ]\n\nWait, no, actually, the order is a bit different. Let me compute each term:\n\nWait, no, let's expand this properly. When you compute \u27e8a| (B|b\u27e9), where a and b are states and B is an operator, you take the inner product of a with B|b\u27e9.\n\nSo, \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 is 0.5\u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 + 0.5\u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nWait, no, perhaps a better approach is to compute the inner product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute it as a matrix product. Let me write |\u03c8\u27e9 as a column vector. Since |\u2191\u27e9 is [1,0]^T and |\u2193\u27e9 is [0,1]^T, then |\u03c8\u27e9 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\n\u03c3x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], so \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8\u27e9 multiplied by \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nWait, since all coefficients are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose.\n\nSo, |\u03c8\u27e9^T is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nMultiply by \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9: [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nSo the inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 0.5 is 1/2, sqrt(3)/2 is same. So each term is (1/2)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. There are two such terms, so total is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I compute the matrix product, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the inner product is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.\n\nSo it's (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 2 * (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, that's the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. So approximately 0.866.\n\nBut wait, another approach: because the expectation value of \u03c3x for a spin in a state |\u03b8, \u03c6\u27e9 is sin(2\u03b8) cos \u03c6? Wait, maybe that's for a different basis. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nWait, maybe I can write the state in terms of eigenstates of \u03c3x. The eigenstates of \u03c3x are (|\u2191\u27e9 + |\u2193\u27e9)/sqrt(2) and (|\u2191\u27e9 - |\u2193\u27e9)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value as I did before.\n\nSo, from the calculation, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the state is mostly in the |\u2193\u27e9 state, but with a component in |\u2191\u27e9. So the expectation value of \u03c3x, which measures the expectation in the x-direction, would be positive because the state has more weight in |\u2193\u27e9, which is the -z direction. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value using the matrix approach correctly.\n\nWait, let's do that again.\n\nThe state |\u03c8\u27e9 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\n\u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]].\n\nSo \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.\n\nThen \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is the dot product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nSo 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.\n\nSo each term is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 \u2248 0.433.\n\nAdding both gives sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Because another way to compute expectation value is using the probabilities. Hmm, perhaps not, because \u03c3x doesn't have the same eigenstates as \u03c3z.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x.\n\nSo expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nCompute each part:\n\n10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\n5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5*1.732)/2 \u2248 (8.66)/2 \u22484.33.\n\nSo sum is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205080757.\n\nSo sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866025403785.\n\nSo 5*(0.866025403785) = 4.330127018925.\n\nThen 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\nSo total is (-5) + 4.330127 \u2248 -0.669873.\n\nRounded to one decimal place, that would be -0.7.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is -0.7.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, the state is 0.5 |\u2191> + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193>.\n\nSo when I computed \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9, I got -0.5, which is correct.\n\nFor \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, I got sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866, which seems correct based on the matrix calculation.\n\nSo 10*(-0.5) = -5, 5*(sqrt(3)/2) \u22485*(0.866) \u22484.33. So -5 +4.33= -0.67, which rounds to -0.7.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) -1.4\n\nB)1.65\n\nC)-0.7\n\nD)0.85\n\nSo option C is -0.7, which matches our calculation.\n\nHmm, but I should make sure I didn't make any mistake in the \u03c3x expectation value. Let me think again.\n\nAnother way to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is to write the state in terms of the eigenstates of \u03c3x. The eigenstates of \u03c3x are |+x\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 + |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2 and |\u2212x\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 \u2212 |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nExpressing |\u03c8\u27e9 in terms of |+x\u27e9 and |\u2212x\u27e9.\n\nLet me write |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|+x\u27e9 + b|\u2212x\u27e9.\n\nSo, solving for a and b.\n\nWe have:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 + |\u2193\u27e9)/(\u221a2) * a + (|\u2191\u27e9 \u2212 |\u2193\u27e9)/(\u221a2) * b.\n\nGrouping terms:\n\n= [ (a + b)|\u2191\u27e9 + (a \u2212 b)|\u2193\u27e9 ] / \u221a2.\n\nBut |\u03c8\u27e9 is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nSo,\n\n(a + b)/\u221a2 = 0.5,\n\n(a \u2212 b)/\u221a2 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nMultiply both equations by \u221a2:\n\na + b = 0.5 * \u221a2 \u2248 0.7071,\n\na - b = (sqrt(3)/2) * \u221a2 = sqrt(6)/2 \u2248 1.2247.\n\nNow, solving for a and b.\n\nAdding the two equations:\n\n2a = 0.7071 +1.2247 \u22481.9318 \u2192 a\u22480.9659.\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\n2b = 0.7071 -1.2247 \u2248-0.5176 \u2192 b\u2248-0.2588.\n\nNow, the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is |a|^2 \u2212 |b|^2.\n\nBecause \u03c3x has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+x\u27e9 and |\u2212x\u27e9.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1) = (|a|^2 \u2212 |b|^2).\n\nCompute |a|^2 and |b|^2.\n\na \u22480.9659 \u2192 |a|^2 \u2248 (0.9659)^2 \u22480.933.\n\nb \u2248-0.2588 \u2192 |b|^2 \u2248 (0.2588)^2 \u22480.06698.\n\nSo, |a|^2 \u2212 |b|^2 \u22480.933 \u22120.06698 \u22480.866, which matches our previous result of sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660. So this confirms that \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is correct.\n\nSo, the expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.8660) = -5 +4.330= -0.6698, which rounds to -0.7. So the correct option is C) -0.7.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) for the given spin-half particle in the state \\( |\\psi\\rangle = 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. These |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of the sigma_z operator. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z + 5\u03c3x. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is found by taking the conjugate transpose of the state vector, multiplying the operator, and then the state vector again. So, \u27e8\u03c8| O |\u03c8\u27e9, where O is the operator. So I'll need to compute this for each part of the operator, probably.\n\nThe operator given is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation value will be the sum of the expectations of each term. That is, \u27e810\u03c3z +5\u03c3x\u27e9 = 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nI think I can compute each expectation separately and then combine them.\n\nLet me break it down. First, let's compute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, this should be straightforward.\n\nThe state \u03c8 is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. So the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Wait, let me confirm: sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. But wait, the coefficients need to satisfy normalization. Let me check: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized.\n\nSo the expectation value of \u03c3z is given by the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Because when the state is an eigenstate, the expectation is just the eigenvalue times the probability.\n\n\u03c3z has eigenvalues +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9. So the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let's compute that.\n\n0.5 squared is 0.25. So 0.25 * 1 = 0.25.\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75.\n\nAdding them together: 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = -0.5. Therefore, 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = 10 * (-0.5) = -5.\n\nNow, onto \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Oh wait, \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which I think is the spin in the x-direction. But the states |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, not \u03c3x. So I can't directly use them for \u03c3x. Hmm, this might require a bit more work.\n\nI remember that \u03c3x has eigenstates that are superpositions of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9. Alternatively, the expectation value can be found using the formula \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nLet me write out the components. The state \u03c8 is a column vector. Let me represent |\u2191\u27e9 as (1, 0) and |\u2193\u27e9 as (0, 1). So \u03c8 is 0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9, which in vector form is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nThe Pauli X matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So \u03c3x in matrix form is:\n0 1\n1 0\n\nSo to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, I need to compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nLet me write \u03c8 as a column vector:\n[0.5\n sqrt(3)/2]\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nMultiply \u03c8\u2020 by \u03c3x: [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] \u2192 [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nThen multiply this by \u03c8:\n\n[sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nWhich is (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866. Therefore, 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 5 * 0.866 \u2248 4.33.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I did that correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using probabilities. But no, since \u03c3x is not diagonal in the \u03c3z basis, we need to compute it via the matrix multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the expectation value of \u03c3x can be found as ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) where a and b are the coefficients of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 respectively, but wait, that might not be correct. Hmm, wait no, I think that's for \u03c3z.\n\nWait, for \u03c3z, the expectation is (|a|^2)(+1) + (|b|^2)(-1) = |a|^2 - |b|^2. But for \u03c3x, it's different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: the expectation value of \u03c3x is equal to the sum over all possible i and j of (\u03c8_i^* \u03c8_j) * \u27e8i|\u03c3x|j\u27e9.\n\nBut since \u03c3x swaps |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, because \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9 and \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nSo when I compute \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9, it's equal to (0.5)(0.5)*\u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5)*\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)(sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nBut \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is zero because \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9, so the inner product is zero. Similarly, \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is zero. The cross terms are:\n\n\u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191| |\u2191\u27e9 = 1, because \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9. Similarly, \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2193| |\u2193\u27e9 = 1.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n= (0.5 * 0.5) * 0 + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) * 1 + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) * 1 + (sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(3)/2) * 0\n\nSo the terms are:\n\n0 + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) + 0.\n\nEach of those terms is (0.5 * 0.866) \u2248 0.433. But wait, wait, 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3)/4) \u2248 0.433. So adding them together: 0.433 + 0.433 = 0.866. Which is the same as sqrt(3)/2. So that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo putting it all together, the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\n10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\n5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5*1.732)/2 \u2248 (8.66)/2 \u2248 4.33.\n\nSo adding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but the options are given to one decimal place. So -0.67 rounds to -0.7.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again. Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.\n\nSo 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5*1.73205)/2 = (8.66025)/2 = 4.330125.\n\nSo 10\u03c3z gives -5, 5\u03c3x gives +4.330125.\n\nAdding them: -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.\n\nWhich is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is -0.7.\n\nSo the answer should be C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. These |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of the sigma_z operator. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z + 5\u03c3x. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is found by taking the conjugate transpose of the state vector, multiplying the operator, and then the state vector again. So, \u27e8\u03c8| O |\u03c8\u27e9, where O is the operator. So I'll need to compute this for each part of the operator, probably.\n\nThe operator given is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation value will be the sum of the expectations of each term. That is, \u27e810\u03c3z +5\u03c3x\u27e9 = 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nI think I can compute each expectation separately and then combine them.\n\nLet me break it down. First, let's compute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, this should be straightforward.\n\nThe state \u03c8 is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. So the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Wait, let me confirm: sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. But wait, the coefficients need to satisfy normalization. Let me check: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized.\n\nSo the expectation value of \u03c3z is given by the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Because when the state is an eigenstate, the expectation is just the eigenvalue times the probability.\n\n\u03c3z has eigenvalues +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9. So the expectation value \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let's compute that.\n\n0.5 squared is 0.25. So 0.25 * 1 = 0.25.\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75.\n\nAdding them together: 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = -0.5. Therefore, 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = 10 * (-0.5) = -5.\n\nNow, onto \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Oh wait, \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which I think is the spin in the x-direction. But the states |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, not \u03c3x.

Alternatively, the expectation value can be found using the formula \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nLet me write out the components. The state \u03c8 is a column vector. Let me represent |\u2191\u27e9 as (1, 0) and |\u2193\u27e9 as (0, 1). So \u03c8 is 0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9, which in vector form is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nThe Pauli X matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So \u03c3x in matrix form is:\n0 1\n1 0\n\nSo to compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, I need to compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nLet me write \u03c8 as a column vector:\n[0.5\n sqrt(3)/2]\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nMultiply \u03c8\u2020 by \u03c3x: [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] \u2192 [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nThen multiply this by \u03c8:\n\n[sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nWhich is (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. I remember that expectation values are like the average outcome of a measurement on a quantum state.\n\nThe particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. Oh wait, and |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z. Right, \u03c3z is the Pauli z-matrix. So the state is a combination of the eigenstates of \u03c3z.\n\nThe operator given is 10\u03c3z + 5\u03c3x. I need to find the expectation value of this operator. Oh, expectation value formula is \u27e8\u03c8| O |\u03c8\u27e9, where O is the operator. So I should compute \u27e8\u03c8| (10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x) |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nWait, but since expectation values are linear, I can split this into two parts: 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. That should make it easier.\n\nFirst, let's find \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9. Since the state is expressed in terms of \u03c3z eigenstates, this should be straightforward. The expectation value of \u03c3z is the probability of being in |\u2191\u27e9 times the eigenvalue plus the probability of |\u2193\u27e9 times its eigenvalue.\n\nThe eigenvalues for \u03c3z are +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9. So the state coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me compute the probabilities. The probability of |\u2191\u27e9 is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. The probability of |\u2193\u27e9 is |sqrt(3)/2|^2. Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. Squared, that's (3/4) = 0.75.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.0.\n\nNow, the second part is \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3x is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are different, but I can compute the expectation value directly without needing to change the basis. The expectation value is \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nThe Pauli matrices: \u03c3x = [[0,1],[1,0]]. So for a state |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is |a|^2 + |b|^2 multiplied by some terms. Wait, actually, I think the expectation value of \u03c3x can be found using the formula: 2Re(ab*) where a and b are the coefficients of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 respectively. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: \u03c3x can be written as |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| + |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|. So when you compute \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9, it's [0.5*\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193| ] * \u03c3x * [0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\nLet me compute this step by step. Let's denote a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2. Then, the expression becomes:\n\na* * b + b* * a, because \u03c3x swaps the states. Wait, more accurately, when you multiply the terms, you get a a* b b (for \u03c3x acting on |\u2191\u27e9 gives |\u2193\u27e9, so the inner product is when you have a* and b. Hmm, maybe I should compute it as:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 = a a* \u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 + a b* \u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 + b a* \u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 + b b* \u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nBut \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 is 0. Similarly, \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 is 0. The cross terms are:\n\na b* \u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 = a b* \u27e8\u2191| |\u2191\u27e9 = a b*. Because \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9, so \u27e8\u2191| \u03c3x |\u2193\u27e9 is 1. Similarly, the other cross term is b a* \u27e8\u2193| \u03c3x |\u2191\u27e9 = b a* * 1.\n\nSo putting it all together, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = a b* + b a*.\n\nWait, but a and b are real numbers in this case. So a* = a, and b* = b. So it's a b + b a = 2 a b.\n\nSo let's compute 2ab. a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.\n\n2 * 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = (2 * (sqrt(3)/4 )) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is approximately 0.866. So 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is 5 * 0.866 \u2248 4.33.\n\nNow, adding the two parts: 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -5.0, and 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is approximately 4.33. So total expectation value is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. Oh wait, when I compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, I have a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. So a*b + b*a = 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) * 2 \u2192 which is (sqrt(3)/4) * 2 \u2192 sqrt(3)/2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the total expectation value is -5 + (5*sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 -5 +4.3301 \u2248 -0.6699, which rounds to approximately -0.7.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.\n\nThe problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. The states |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of the \u03c3z operator. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula \u27e8\u03c8|O|\u03c8\u27e9, where O is the operator and \u03c8 is the state vector.\n\nSo first, let's break down the operator. The operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation value would be the sum of the expectations of each term. That is, \u27e810\u03c3z +5\u03c3x\u27e9 =10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nI think I can compute each expectation separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for \u03c3z are +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nThe state \u03c8 is given as (0.5)|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. So, the coefficients are a=0.5 for |\u2191\u27e9 and b=sqrt(3)/2 for |\u2193\u27e9. Because |a|\u00b2 + |b|\u00b2 should equal 1, let's check: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So that's correct.\n\nThe expectation value of \u03c3z is |a|\u00b2*(+1) + |b|\u00b2*(-1). So let's compute that.\n\n|a|\u00b2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|\u00b2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\nSo 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\nNow, onto \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. This is a bit trickier. I think \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which for spin-1/2 particles is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]]. The eigenstates of \u03c3x are |+x\u27e9 and |-x\u27e9, which are superpositions of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nBut how do I compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 for a given state \u03c8?\n\nI remember that for any operator O, the expectation value is \u03c8\u2020 O \u03c8. So I can write the state \u03c8 as a column vector and compute it.\n\nLet me write \u03c8 as a column vector. Let's take |\u2191\u27e9 as (1,0) and |\u2193\u27e9 as (0,1). So \u03c8 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo \u03c8 = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nThe \u03c3x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So let's compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nCalculating that: \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nMultiplying by \u03c8 gives:\n\n( sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 ) + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nWhich is (sqrt(3)/4 ) + (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, but wait! Let me double-check. Oh, wait, no, maybe I did that wrong. Let me compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8 step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it as:\n\n\u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8 = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nMultiplying the matrices step by step. Let's compute \u03c3x \u03c8 first.\n\n\u03c3x \u03c8 = [0 1;1 0] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].\n\nNow, \u03c8\u2020 (\u03c3x \u03c8) = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5] = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 ) \n\nEach term is (sqrt(3)/4 ) + (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is approximately 0.8660.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Alternatively, I remember that for spin-\u00bd particles, the expectation value of \u03c3x is given by (a b* + a* b), where a and b are the coefficients of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 respectively. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, because \u03c3x = |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| + |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 = |a|^2 \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + a b* \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 + a* b \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + |b|^2 \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nBut \u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2193\u27e9, and \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9. So:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 = a a* \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 + a b* \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 + a* b \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 + b b* \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9.\n\nBut \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 is zero. So this simplifies to a b* * \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 + a* b * \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nWhich becomes a b* *1 + a* b *1 = 2 Re(a b*).\n\nAlternatively, since a and b are real numbers in this case (because the coefficients are real), Re(a b*) is just a b.\n\nWait, in this problem, the coefficients a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2 are real numbers, so a b* is a*b.\n\nSo a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. Then a b = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 \u2248 0.4330.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2 * (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo that's consistent with the matrix method. So I can confirm that \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWait, wait, but in my earlier calculation using the matrix method, I got sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. So 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 would be 5*(sqrt(3)/2) \u22485 * 0.866 \u22484.330.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Wait, the operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation is 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nWe have \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = -0.5, so 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660. So 5*0.8660 \u22484.33.\n\nAdding these together: -5 +4.33 \u2248-0.67.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the choices are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.\n\nHmm, -0.67 is close to -0.7, which is option C. So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.\n\nWait, but let me recheck the calculations to be sure.\n\nSo let me recompute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9:\n\nThe state is 0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9.\n\n|\u2191\u27e9 has eigenvalue +1 for \u03c3z, |\u2193\u27e9 eigenvalue -1.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1).\n\n0.5^2 = 0.25, (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) =0.75.\n\nSo 0.25 *1 +0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.\n\n10 * (-0.5) is -5.\n\nNow, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9: as before, 2 * (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) )= 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660.\n\nSo 5 * 0.8660 is approximately 4.33.\n\nSo sum is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nHmm, so that's approximately -0.67. The options are C) -0.7, which is the closest. So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.\n\nBut wait, wait, another way to think about this: perhaps I should compute more precisely.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.8660254.\n\nSo 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (5 *1.73205)/2 = (8.66025)/2 \u22484.330125.\n\nSo 10\u03c3z expectation is -5, plus 5\u03c3x expectation 4.330125.\n\nAdding them: -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.\n\nRounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.\n\nSo the answer should be option C) -0.7.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.\n\nThe problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. The states |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of the \u03c3z operator. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula \u27e8\u03c8|O|\u03c8\u27e9, where O is the operator and \u03c8 is the state vector.\n\nSo first, let's break down the operator. The operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation value would be the sum of the expectations of each term. That is, \u27e810\u03c3z +5\u03c3x\u27e9 =10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nI think I can compute each expectation separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for \u03c3z are +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nThe state \u03c8 is given as (0.5)|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. So, the coefficients are a=0.5 for |\u2191\u27e9 and b=sqrt(3)/2 for |\u2193\u27e9. Because |a|\u00b2 + |b|\u00b2 should equal 1, let's check: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So that's correct.\n\nThe expectation value of \u03c3z is |a|\u00b2*(+1) + |b|\u00b2*(-1). So let's compute that.\n\n|a|\u00b2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|\u00b2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\nSo 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\nNow, onto \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. This is a bit trickier. I think \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which for spin-1/2 particles is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]]. The eigenstates of \u03c3x are |+x\u27e9 and |-x\u27e9, which are superpositions of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nBut how do I compute \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 for a given state \u03c8?\n\nI remember that for any operator O, the expectation value is \u03c8\u2020 O \u03c8. So I can write the state \u03c8 as a column vector and compute it.\n\nLet me write \u03c8 as a column vector. Let's take |\u2191\u27e9 as (1,0) and |\u2193\u27e9 as (0,1). So \u03c8 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo \u03c8 = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nThe \u03c3x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So let's compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8.\n\nCalculating that: \u03c8\u2020 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].\n\nMultiplying by \u03c8 gives:\n\n( sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 ) + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nWhich is (sqrt(3)/4 ) + (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, but wait! Let me double-check. Oh, wait, no, maybe I did that wrong. Let me compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8 step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it as:\n\n\u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8 = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nMultiplying the matrices step by step. Let's compute \u03c3x \u03c8 first.\n\n\u03c3x \u03c8 = [0 1;1 0] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].\n\nNow, \u03c8\u2020 (\u03c3x \u03c8) = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5] = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 ) \n\nEach term is (sqrt(3)/4 ) + (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is approximately 0.8660.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Alternatively, I remember that for spin-\u00bd particles, the expectation value of \u03c3x is given by (a b* + a* b), where a and b are the coefficients of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 respectively. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, because \u03c3x = |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| + |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 = |a|^2 \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + a b* \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 + a* b \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 + |b|^2 \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nBut \u03c3x|\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2193\u27e9, and \u03c3x|\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9. So:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3x|\u03c8\u27e9 = a a* \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 + a b* \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 + a* b \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 + b b* \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9.\n\nBut \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 is zero. So this simplifies to a b* * \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 + a* b * \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nWhich becomes a b* *1 + a* b *1 = 2 Re(a b*).\n\nAlternatively, since a and b are real numbers in this case (because the coefficients are real), Re(a b*) is just a b.\n\nWait, in this problem, the coefficients a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2 are real numbers, so a b* is a*b.\n\nSo a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. Then a b = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 \u2248 0.4330.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2 * (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo that's consistent with the matrix method. So I can confirm that \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWait, wait, but in my earlier calculation using the matrix method, I got sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. So 5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 would be 5*(sqrt(3)/2) \u22485 * 0.866 \u22484.330.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Wait, the operator is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So the expectation is 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9.\n\nWe have \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = -0.5, so 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660. So 5*0.8660 \u22484.33.\n\nAdding these together: -5 +4.33 \u2248-0.67.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the choices are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.\n\nHmm, -0.67 is close to -0.7, which is option C. So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.\n\nWait, but let me recheck the calculations to be sure.\n\nSo let me recompute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9:\n\nThe state is 0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9.\n\n|\u2191\u27e9 has eigenvalue +1 for \u03c3z, |\u2193\u27e9 eigenvalue -1.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1).\n\n0.5^2 = 0.25, (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) =0.75.\n\nSo 0.25 *1 +0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.\n\n10 * (-0.5) is -5.\n\nNow, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9: as before, 2 * (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) )= 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660.\n\nSo 5 * 0.8660 is approximately 4.33.\n\nSo sum is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nHmm, so that's approximately -0.67. The options are C) -0.7, which is the closest. So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.\n\nBut wait, wait, another way to think about this: perhaps I should compute more precisely.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.8660254.\n\nSo 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (5 *1.73205)/2 = (8.66025)/2 \u22484.330125.\n\nSo 10\u03c3z expectation is -5, plus 5\u03c3x expectation 4.330125.\n\nAdding them: -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.\n\nRounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.\n\nSo the answer should be option C) -0.7.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) for the given spin-half particle in the state \\( \\psi = 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. And |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are the eigenstates of \u03c3z. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3z + 5\u03c3x. Oh wait, and the options are given, so that might help if I get stuck.\n\nHmm, expectation value. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the same state. So, for a given operator O, the expectation value is \u27e8\u03c8| O |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nThe operator here is 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x. So, maybe I can compute the expectation value for each term separately and then add them.\n\nLet me break it down. The expectation value of 10\u03c3z +5\u03c3x is equal to 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. So I can compute \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, what's \u03c3z and \u03c3x? Oh right, the Pauli matrices. \u03c3z is diagonal with eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, respectively. \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the spin states.\n\nSo the state \u03c8 is given as 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. Let me denote this as \u03c8 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, where a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check the normalization. The sum of squares should be 1. a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.\n\nNow, let's find \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3z, this should be straightforward. The expectation value is just the probability of being in |\u2191\u27e9 times +1 plus the probability of being in |\u2193\u27e9 times -1. Because \u03c3z|\u2191\u27e9 = +|\u2191\u27e9 and \u03c3z|\u2193\u27e9 = -|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nSo the probability of |\u2191\u27e9 is |a|\u00b2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. Probability of |\u2193\u27e9 is |b|\u00b2 = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\nThen, the first term is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.\n\nNow, onto \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3x is a bit trickier. Since \u03c3x is the Pauli X matrix, it's [[0,1],[1,0]]. So it swaps the basis states.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9. Let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for expectation of \u03c3x in a state a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9. Let me think. The expectation value can be written as 2 * Re(a b*), but wait, wait. I think the general formula is that for a state \u03c8 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2193\u27e9, the expectation value of \u03c3x is 2 (a b* + a* b )? Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it directly.\n\nExpressed in matrix form, \u03c8 is a column vector [a; b]. So \u03c3x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so \u03c3x |\u03c8\u27e9 is [b; a]. So \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8 = a* b + b* a.\n\nWait, \u03c8 is [a, b], and \u03c8\u2020 is [a*, b*]. So \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3x \u03c8 is (a* b + b* a). Because \u03c3x swaps the components. So yeah, that's the expectation value.\n\nBut wait, since a and b are real numbers here, because the given coefficients are real (0.5 and sqrt(3)/2). So a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2. So a* = a, and b* = b.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = a b + b a = 2 a b.\n\nLet me compute that. a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So 2 * (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (1) * (sqrt(3)/2) )= sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nNow, the second term is 5 * \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 \u2248 5 * 0.8660 \u2248 4.33.\n\nSo adding both terms together: 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = (-5) + (4.33) \u2248 -0.67.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me compute it more precisely. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 5 * 0.866 is 4.33. Then, 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is -5. So -5 +4.33 is -0.67.\n\nBut wait, the options are given. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA) -1.4\nB) 1.65\nC) -0.7\nD) 0.85\n\nHmm, -0.67 is close to option C, which is -0.7. But wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.\n\nWait, let me compute the exact value. sqrt(3) is about 1.73205, so sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.8660254.\n\nSo, \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 = 2 * (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * (0.5 * 0.8660254) = 0.8660254. So 5 * 0.8660254 = 4.330127.\n\nThen, 10\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is 10 * (-0.5) = -5. So total expectation is -5 +4.330127 = -0.669873. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's recheck each step.\n\nThe state is \u03c8 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. Correct.\n\n\u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 is |a|\u00b2 * (+1) + |b|\u00b2*(-1) = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Correct.\n\n\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9 is a*b + a*b (since a and b are real, so a* =a, b* =b. So 2ab. a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (1)*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660254. So 5 * this is approx 4.330127.\n\nTotal expectation value: 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2.\n\nWait, wait a second. 5*sqrt(3)/2 is approximately (5 * 1.732)/2 = (8.66)/2 =4.33, yes. So total is -5 +4.33= -0.67.\n\nBut when rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So option C is -0.7. So the correct answer should be option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe question says: A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition of 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. The states |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3_z. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, expectation value. Right, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome you'd expect if you measured that observable many times on the same state. The formula is \u27e8\u03c8| O |\u03c8\u27e9, where O is the operator.\n\nSo the operator here is 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x. I can probably break this down into two parts: 10\u03c3_z and 5\u03c3_x. Since expectation value is linear, the expectation of a sum is the sum of the expectations. So \u27e810\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x\u27e9 = 10\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9.\n\nThat makes it easier. So I need to find \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 separately, then compute each part and add them together.\n\nFirst, let's find \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3_z, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for \u03c3_z are +1 and -1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 respectively, right? Because \u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 = +|\u2191\u27e9 and \u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 = -|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nThe state \u03c8 is given as 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2)|\u2193\u27e9. So the coefficients are 0.5 for |\u2191\u27e9 and \u221a3/2 for |\u2193\u27e9. Wait, let me double-check: 0.5 squared is 0.25, (\u221a3/2)^2 is 3/4, which sums to 1. So the state is normalized, good.\n\nSo, for \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9, because \u03c3_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.\n\nSo the probability of measuring spin-up (i.e., \u03c3_z = +1) is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. Similarly, the probability of spin-down (\u03c3_z = -1) is |\u221a3/2|^2 = (3/4).\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 0.25 *1 = 0.25, 0.75*(-1) = -0.75. Adding them gives 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. Got it.\n\nNext, \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3_x is the Pauli X matrix, which is not diagonal in the \u03c3_z basis. So I can't directly compute it as I did for \u03c3_z. I need to find the expectation value using the state.\n\nThe Pauli X matrix is [[0, 1],[1, 0]]. So in the basis of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, \u03c3_x swaps them.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is \u27e8\u03c8| \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9. Let me write out the state \u03c8 as a vector. In the \u03c3_z basis, |\u2191\u27e9 is [1; 0], |\u2193\u27e9 is [0; 1]. So \u03c8 is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].\n\nSo \u03c8 is a column vector: [0.5; (\u221a3)/2].\n\nTo compute \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9, I can compute \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3_x \u03c8. Alternatively, since \u03c3_x is the same as the matrix, I can compute it as the inner product.\n\nLet me write \u03c8 as a row vector: [0.5, (\u221a3)/2]. The \u03c3_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I multiply \u03c3_x with \u03c8, it swaps the components. So \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 would be [ (\u221a3)/2, 0.5 ]^T.\n\nThen, the inner product of \u03c8 with this is (0.5)*(\u221a3/2) + (\u221a3/2)*(0.5). Wait, no, wait: \u03c8 is [0.5, (\u221a3/2)], and \u03c3_x \u03c8 is [(\u221a3/2), 0.5]. So the inner product is (0.5)(\u221a3/2) + (\u221a3/2)(0.5) = [0.5 * \u221a3/2 + \u221a3/2 * 0.5 ].\n\nLet me compute that: each term is (\u221a3)/4. So two terms make (\u221a3)/4 * 2 = \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for the expectation value of \u03c3_x in a spin-1/2 state. Oh right! The expectation value \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is equal to 2 times the (off-diagonal) element of the density matrix multiplied by the respective states. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the state in terms of \u03c3_x eigenstates. Or maybe use the formula for expectation value of \u03c3_x for a general state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using the matrix representation. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nSo, \u03c8 = [a; b], where a=0.5, b=\u221a3/2.\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 = [b; a].\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 = a*b* + b*a. Because when you take the inner product, it's a*(b) + b*(a). Because the first component of \u03c8 is a, and the first component of \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 is b. The second component of \u03c8 is b, and the second component of \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 is a. So when you compute the inner product, it's a*b + b*a = 2ab.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let's compute it properly. The inner product is the conjugate transpose of \u03c8 multiplied by \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nBut \u03c8 is real here, so it's just [a, b] multiplied by [b; a], which gives a*b + b*a = 2ab.\n\nSo in this case, a is 0.5, b is \u221a3/2. So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(\u221a3/2) = 2*(\u221a3/4) )= \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, so \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is \u221a3/2 \u22480.866.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the maximum expectation value for \u03c3_x is 1, since \u03c3_x has eigenvalues \u00b11. So 0.866 is within that range.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is \u221a3/2, which is approximately 0.866.\n\nWait, let me verify that calculation. a =0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. So 2ab is 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo now, putting it all together.\n\nThe expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x is 10\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9.\n\nSo, substituting the numbers: 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\n5*(sqrt(3)/2) \u22485*(0.8660) \u22484.3301.\n\nAdding them together: -5 +4.3301 \u2248 -0.6699.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Hmm, but wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 5*0.866 is about 4.33. So 10*(-0.5) is -5. So adding gives -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.67.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is -0.7, which is the closest. But wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's compute each part more accurately.\n\nFirst, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.\n\nsqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.8660254.\n\nSo 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) =5 * 0.8660254 =4.330127.\n\nAnd 10*(-0.5) is -5. So sum is -5 +4.330127 = -0.669873, which is approximately -0.67.\n\nSo up to one decimal place, that's -0.7 because 0.669 is 0.67, which rounds to 0.7 when considering the first decimal.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, 0.669873 is about 0.67, so when rounded to one decimal place, that's 0.7. But since it's negative, it's -0.7.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I did everything correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: the state is |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2)|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nThe expectation value of \u03c3_x is (\u03c8| \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9), which I found to be \u221a3/2 \u22480.866.\n\nSo 5 times that is 5*(0.866) \u22484.33.\n\nAnd 10 times \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 is 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\nAdding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Rounded to one decimal, that's -0.7.\n\nWait, but wait. Another thought: is the expectation value for \u03c3_x in this state correct?\n\nWait, another way to compute \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is to write the state in the \u03c3_x basis. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for expectation value in terms of the Bloch sphere.\n\nBut I think my earlier calculation is correct. So perhaps the answer is option C, which is -0.7.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.\n\nWait, another way: \u03c3_x can be written as |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| + |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|.\n\nSo, the expectation value is \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3_x \u03c8.\n\nWhich is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) * \u03c3_x * (0.5, sqrt(3)/2).\n\n\u03c3_x acting on (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) gives (sqrt(3)/2, 0.5).\n\nThen, the inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 *2 = 0.5*sqrt(3). Wait, that's the same as before, which is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo yes, the expectation of \u03c3_x is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866, so 5 times that is about 4.33.\n\nSo adding 10*(-0.5) = -5, gives -0.6698, which is approximately -0.67, so -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.\n\nWait, but the options are given up to one decimal place, so -0.7 is option C.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C, -0.7.\n",

So \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 = [b; a].\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 = a*b* + b*a. Because when you take the inner product, it's a*(b) + b*(a). Because the first component of \u03c8 is a, and the first component of \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 is b. The second component of \u03c8 is b, and the second component of \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 is a. So when you compute the inner product, it's a*b + b*a = 2ab.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let's compute it properly. The inner product is the conjugate transpose of \u03c8 multiplied by \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nBut \u03c8 is real here, so it's just [a, b] multiplied by [b; a], which gives a*b + b*a = 2ab.\n\nSo in this case, a is 0.5, b is \u221a3/2. So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(\u221a3/2) = 2*(\u221a3/4) )= \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.866.\n\nWait, so \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is \u221a3/2 \u22480.866.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the maximum expectation value for \u03c3_x is 1, since \u03c3_x has eigenvalues \u00b11. So 0.866 is within that range.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is \u221a3/2, which is approximately 0.866.\n\nWait, let me verify that calculation. a =0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. So 2ab is 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo now, putting it all together.\n\nThe expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x is 10\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9.\n\nSo, substituting the numbers: 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\n5*(sqrt(3)/2) \u22485*(0.8660) \u22484.3301.\n\nAdding them together: -5 +4.3301 \u2248 -0.6699.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Hmm, but wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 5*0.866 is about 4.33. So 10*(-0.5) is -5. So adding gives -5 +4.33 = -0.67.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.67.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is -0.7, which is the closest. But wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's compute each part more accurately.\n\nFirst, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.\n\nsqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.8660254.\n\nSo 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) =5 * 0.8660254 =4.330127.\n\nAnd 10*(-0.5) is -5. So sum is -5 +4.330127 = -0.669873, which is approximately -0.67.\n\nSo up to one decimal place, that's -0.7 because 0.669 is 0.67, which rounds to 0.7 when considering the first decimal.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, 0.669873 is about 0.67, so when rounded to one decimal place, that's 0.7. But since it's negative, it's -0.7.\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I did everything correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: the state is |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2)|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nThe expectation value of \u03c3_x is (\u03c8| \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9), which I found to be \u221a3/2 \u22480.866.\n\nSo 5 times that is 5*(0.866) \u22484.33.\n\nAnd 10 times \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 is 10*(-0.5) = -5.\n\nAdding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Rounded to one decimal, that's -0.7.\n\nWait, but wait. Another thought: is the expectation value for \u03c3_x in this state correct?\n\nWait, another way to compute \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is to write the state in the \u03c3_x basis. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for expectation value in terms of the Bloch sphere.\n\nBut I think my earlier calculation is correct. So perhaps the answer is option C, which is -0.7.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.\n\nWait, another way: \u03c3_x can be written as |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| + |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|.\n\nSo, the expectation value is \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3_x \u03c8.\n\nWhich is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) * \u03c3_x * (0.5, sqrt(3)/2).\n\n\u03c3_x acting on (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) gives (sqrt(3)/2, 0.5).\n\nThen, the inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 *2 = 0.5*sqrt(3). Wait, that's the same as before, which is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo yes, the expectation of \u03c3_x is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866, so 5 times that is about 4.33.\n\nSo adding 10*(-0.5) = -5, gives -0.6698, which is approximately -0.67, so -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.\n\nWait, but the options are given up to one decimal place, so -0.7 is option C.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C, -0.7.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \\( 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\) for the given spin-half particle in the state \\( |\\psi\\rangle = 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle \\).
