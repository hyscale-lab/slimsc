      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about electrons and positrons colliding and producing photons. Alright, let's read it again carefully.\n\nSo, an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I think I need to consider conservation laws here\u2014conservation of energy and momentum. Since the particles annihilate into photons, which are massless, the total energy and momentum before the collision must equal the total after.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014wait, electrons and positrons have the same mass, right? And since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta might add up in a certain way.\n\nLet me think. The Lorentz factor is gamma, so gamma equals 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), but perhaps more useful here is the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass.\n\nFor a relativistic particle, the total energy E is gamma * m * c\u00b2, and the momentum p is gamma * m * v. But another way to express p is (gamma m v) = (gamma m c\u00b2) * (v/c) / c. Alternatively, since E\u00b2 = (pc c)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)^2, so p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2) / c\u00b2. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to just compute the momentum in terms of gamma and velocity.\n\nWait, but wait, for each particle, the momentum is gamma * m * v. So the electron and positron have opposite momenta since they're moving in opposite directions.\n\nWait, let me get the directions right. The electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis\u2014so let's say the positive x-direction. The positron is moving from the right, so that would be the negative x-direction. So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nSo, the electron's momentum is in the positive x-direction, and the positron's is in the negative x-direction. So the total momentum before collision is the sum of these two.\n\nWait, but wait: Lorentz factor is gamma, and the momentum is gamma * m * v. So for each particle, their momentum would be:\n\nElectron: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e (in +x direction)\nPositron: p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p (but since it's moving in -x, it's negative: p_p = - gamma_p * m_p * v_p )\n\nWait, but since the positron has a lower gamma, but is moving in the opposite direction, I need to calculate their momenta.\n\nBut wait, since the electron and positron have the same mass (m_e = m_p), but different gammas and velocities. Hmm.\n\nWait, but wait, the positron is a particle of antimatter, but in terms of mass, it's the same as the electron. So m_p = m_e.\n\nSo, let me write down the momenta:\n\nElectron: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e (positive x)\nPositron: p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p (negative x direction, so p_p = - gamma_p * m_e * v_p )\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, wait: the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is in the negative x direction. So its momentum is negative.\n\nBut I need to find the total momentum before collision. So sum the two.\n\nSo, p_total_initial = p_e + p_p = gamma_e m_e v_e - gamma_p m_e v_p.\n\nWait, but I need to find v_e and v_p in terms of the given gammas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the relation between gamma and velocity. For each particle, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo for the electron, gamma_e =4. So v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = c * sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682 c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = c*(\u221a3)/2 \u2248 0.8660 c.\n\nSo, the electron's velocity is higher than the positron's, but since it's moving in the opposite direction, their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, but wait, the positron's velocity is in the negative x direction, so its v_p is negative? So maybe I should write v_e as positive and v_p as negative.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define the directions more precisely. Let's say the electron is moving along the positive x-axis, so v_e is positive. The positron is moving along the negative x-axis, so v_p is negative. So the positron's velocity is -v_p (but in magnitude, it's the value we calculated).\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify:\n\nElectron: moving to the right (positive x direction), velocity v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)c.\n\nPositron: moving to the left (negative x direction), so its velocity is v_p = - c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = -c * sqrt(3/4) = -(sqrt(3)/2)c.\n\nSo, their velocities are:\n\nv_e = (sqrt(15)/4)c \u2248 0.9682c,\n\nv_p = -(sqrt(3)/2)c \u2248 -0.8660c.\n\nSo, their momenta:\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\nWait, because gamma_e is 4, m_e is the electron mass, and v_e is sqrt(15)/4 c. So p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) ) = m_e * sqrt(15) c.\n\nSimilarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. Since m_p = m_e and v_p is negative, p_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) ) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, let me compute that. So sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So 3.872 - 1.732 \u2248 2.14. So the total momentum is m_e c * 2.14.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to keep it symbolic for now.\n\nSo, the total initial momentum is in the positive x direction, as the electron's momentum is larger in magnitude.\n\nNow, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E1 and E2, but the problem says they have the same value, so E1 = E2 = E.\n\nWait, no, wait: the problem says the energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. So E_photon1 = E_photon2 = E.\n\nBut photons carry momentum, and their momentum is E/(c), but direction matters. So each photon's momentum is a vector.\n\nSo, the two photons are moving in directions described as upper-right and lower-right. So, both are moving to the right (positive x direction) but one is upwards (positive y) and the other is downwards (negative y). So, their momenta are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says one is moving upper-right, another lower-right. So each photon's direction is to the right, but one is upward and the other is downward. So their momenta in the x and y directions must sum to the initial total momentum.\n\nWait, but the initial momentum is in the x direction only. So the total momentum after collision must also be in the x direction. The y components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other.\n\nHmm, right. So each photon has a momentum vector with x and y components. Let me denote the photons as photon A and photon B.\n\nPhoton A: moving in upper-right direction, so its momentum vector has positive x and positive y components.\n\nPhoton B: moving in lower-right direction, so positive x and negative y.\n\nSince the energies are the same, their magnitudes of momentum are the same because E_photon = |p_photon| * c. So, |p_A| = |p_B| = E/c.\n\nWait, no: E = pc, because for photons, E = pc. So, the magnitudes of the momenta of both photons are equal, since E is the same for both.\n\nSo, |p_A| = |p_B| = E/(c).\n\nBut their directions are different, so their momentum vectors are:\n\np_A = (p_Ax, p_Ay) = (p_A cos \u03b8, p_A sin \u03b8 )\n\np_B = (p_Bx, p_By) = (p_B cos \u03c6, p_B sin \u03c6 )\n\nBut since one is upper-right and the other lower-right, I think the angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 are measured from the x-axis. Let's say photon A has an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon B has an angle \u03c6 below the x-axis. So, their y-components would be p_A sin \u03b8 and p_B sin \u03c6, but with opposite signs if the angles are the same in magnitude.\n\nWait, but the problem says the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So perhaps they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So, \u03b8 and (360 - \u03b8) or (180 - \u03b8) or something? Or maybe they have the same magnitude but opposite signs in y.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So maybe their angles are symmetric about the x-axis. Let me assume that, for simplicity.\n\nSo, let's say photon A has an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon B has an angle \u03b8 below the x-axis. But wait, that would make their y-components opposite in sign.\n\nSo, the total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' momenta.\n\nSo, total p_total_final = (p_Ax + p_Bx, p_Ay + p_By )\n\nBut the initial total momentum is in the x direction, so the y-components of the photons' momenta must sum to zero.\n\nSo, p_Ay + p_By = 0.\n\nWhich implies that p_A sin \u03b8 = - p_B sin \u03c6.\n\nBut since the magnitudes of p_A and p_B are equal (because E_photon is same for both), and |p_A| = |p_B| = E/c.\n\nSo, p_Ay = p_A sin \u03b8,\n\np_By = p_B sin \u03c6.\n\nSo, p_A sin \u03b8 + p_B sin \u03c6 = 0.\n\nBut since |p_A| = |p_B|, let's write p_A = E/c, p_B = E/c.\n\nSo, (E/c) sin \u03b8 + (E/c) sin \u03c6 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by E/c: sin \u03b8 + sin \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, sin \u03c6 = - sin \u03b8.\n\nWhich implies that \u03c6 = -\u03b8, or \u03c6 = 180 - \u03b8, but considering the direction, if one is above x-axis and the other is below, then perhaps \u03c6 = -\u03b8. Or perhaps their angles are \u03b8 and 180 - \u03b8? Hmm, not sure. Maybe better to think that their y-components are opposite.\n\nWait, if \u03b8 is the angle above x-axis for photon A, then photon B's angle would be -\u03b8, so that its y-component is negative of photon A's.\n\nBut wait, the problem says one is upper-right and another is lower-right. So, their angles are measured from the x-axis in the upper and lower right quadrants. So, photon A could have angle \u03b8 above x, and photon B has angle (180 - \u03b8) below x? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of symmetric angles about the x-axis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two photons are emitted symmetrically about the x-axis, such that their y-components cancel each other. So, their angles are \u03b8 and ( -\u03b8 ), making their y-components opposite.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 = - sin (-\u03b8), so that p_Ay = - p_By.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the angles could be \u03b8 and (\u03c0 - \u03b8), but that would put one in the second quadrant, which is not the case here. Because the photons are both in the right half (upper-right and lower-right).\n\nSo, perhaps their angles are \u03b8 and -\u03b8, but then the lower photon would be at -\u03b8, which is in the fourth quadrant, which is lower-right. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, in that case, photon A is at angle \u03b8, and photon B at -\u03b8.\n\nThus, the y-components would be p_A sin \u03b8 and p_B sin (-\u03b8) = - p_B sin \u03b8.\n\nSo, their sum is p_A sin \u03b8 - p_B sin \u03b8.\n\nBut since p_A = p_B = E/c, then this becomes (E/c)( sin \u03b8 - sin \u03b8 ) = 0. Which satisfies the condition for y-momentum conservation.\n\nSo, that's good.\n\nNow, considering the x-components.\n\nThe initial total momentum is in the x-direction, so the sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta must equal the initial total momentum.\n\np_Ax + p_Bx = p_total_initial.\n\nWhich is:\n\np_A cos \u03b8 + p_B cos (-\u03b8) = p_total_initial.\n\nBut cos is even, so cos(-\u03b8) = cos \u03b8.\n\nAnd since p_A = p_B = E/c,\n\n(E/c) cos \u03b8 + (E/c) cos \u03b8 = p_total_initial.\n\nSo,\n\n2 (E/c) cos \u03b8 = p_total_initial.\n\nBut p_total_initial is the total momentum before annihilation, which we calculated earlier as m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, let me make sure. Earlier, I computed p_e = m_e c sqrt(15) and p_p = - m_e c sqrt(3).\n\nSo p_total_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo, 2 (E/c) cos \u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but E is the energy of each photon. So, E = p c, because for a photon, E = p c.\n\nSo, substituting E = p c into the equation:\n\n2 (p c / c ) cos \u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 p cos \u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nHmm, but what is p here? Since E = p c, and each photon has E = p c, so p = E/(c).\n\nWait, maybe I should express everything in terms of E.\n\nWait, each photon's momentum magnitude is E/c, so p_A = p_B = E/c.\n\nSo, going back to the x-component equation:\n\n2 (E/c) cos \u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nLet me solve for cos \u03b8.\n\ncos \u03b8 = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / [ 2 (E/c) ) ]\n\nWait, wait, let me re-arrange:\n\n2 (E/c) cos \u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo,\n\ncos \u03b8 = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / [ 2 (E/c) ) ]\n\nSimplify denominator: 2 (E/c) = 2 (E)/(c).\n\nSo,\n\ncos \u03b8 = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * c ] / ( 2 E )\n\nWait, because the denominator is [2 (E/c) ] so it becomes 2 E / c.\n\nWait, let me re-do the algebra:\n\ncos \u03b8 = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / [ 2 (E/c) ) ]\n\nWhich is [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] * [ c / (2 E) ) ]\n\nSo,\n\ncos \u03b8 = [ m_e c^2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / ( 2 E )\n\nHmm. But m_e c^2 is the rest energy of the electron, which is about 0.511 MeV.\n\nBut perhaps there's another approach. Because the total energy must also be conserved.\n\nThe initial total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nElectron's energy: E_e = gamma_e m_e c^2 =4 m_e c^2.\n\nPositron's energy: E_p = gamma_p m_p c^2 = 2 m_e c^2.\n\nSo, total initial energy E_initial = 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 =6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the photons have energies E each, so total energy E_final = E + E = 2 E.\n\nSo, by conservation of energy:\n\n2 E =6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E =3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo, each photon has energy E=3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So E =3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation for cos \u03b8:\n\ncos \u03b8 = [ m_e c^2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / ( 2 * 3 m_e c\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nm_e c^2 cancels out.\n\nSo,\n\ncos \u03b8 = [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / ( 6 )\n\nCompute sqrt(15) \u22483.87298,\n\nsqrt(3)\u22481.73205.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u22483.87298 -1.73205 \u22482.14093.\n\nSo,\n\ncos \u03b8 \u22482.14093 /6 \u22480.35682.\n\nSo, \u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.35682) \u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, because cos(60\u00b0) is 0.5, cos(70\u00b0) is about 0.3420. So 0.3568 would be a bit less than 69 degrees, maybe around 69 degrees.\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 2.14093 /6 = 0.35682.\n\nWhat angle has a cosine of 0.35682?\n\nLooking at a calculator: arccos(0.35682) \u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, wait, 69 degrees: cos(69\u00b0) \u22480.3584, which is very close to 0.3568. So \u03b8 is approximately 69 degrees.\n\nSo, each photon is emitted at an angle \u03b8 \u224869 degrees above and below the x-axis.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is asking for the angle between the directions of the photons.\n\nSo, photon A is at +\u03b8, and photon B is at -\u03b8. The angle between them is 2\u03b8.\n\nSo, 2 * 69 \u2248138 degrees.\n\nSo, the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOptions are A)74, B)172, C)138, D)96.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be C)138 degrees.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron collide and annihilate into two photons of equal energy, moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.\n\n### Conservation of Energy\nThe total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:\n- Electron energy: \\( E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 \\)\n- Positron energy: \\( E_p = \\gamma_p m_p c^2 = 2 m_e c^2 \\)\n- Total initial energy: \\( E_{\\text{initial}} = E_e + E_p = 6 m_e c^2 \\)\n\nAfter annihilation, the total energy is shared equally between the two photons:\n- Energy of each photon: \\( E = \\frac{E_{\\text{initial}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2 \\)\n\n### Conservation of Momentum\nThe total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron:\n- Electron momentum: \\( p_e = \\gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c = m_e c \\sqrt{15} \\)\n- Positron momentum: \\( p_p = \\gamma_p m_p v_p = 2 m_e \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c\\right) = -m_e c \\sqrt{3} \\)\n- Total initial momentum: \\( p_{\\text{initial}} = p_e + p_p = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\)\n\nAfter annihilation, the photons' momenta must conserve the total momentum.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about electrons and positrons colliding and producing photons. Alright, let's read it again carefully.\n\nSo, an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I think I need to consider conservation laws here\u2014conservation of energy and momentum. Since the particles annihilate into photons, which are massless, the total energy and momentum before the collision must equal the total after.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014wait, electrons and positrons have the same mass, right? And since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta might add up in a certain way.\n\nLet me think. The Lorentz factor is gamma, so gamma equals 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), but perhaps more useful here is the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass.\n\nFor a relativistic particle, the total energy E is gamma * m * c\u00b2, and the momentum p is gamma * m * v. But another way to express p is (gamma m v) = (gamma m c\u00b2) * (v/c) / c. Alternatively, since E\u00b2 = (pc c)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)^2, so p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2) / c\u00b2. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to just compute the momentum in terms of gamma and velocity.\n\nWait, but wait, for each particle, the momentum is gamma * m * v. So the electron and positron have opposite momenta since they're moving in opposite directions.\n\nWait, let me get the directions right. The electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis\u2014so let's say the positive x-direction. The positron is moving from the right, so that would be the negative x-direction. So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nSo, the electron's momentum is in the positive x-direction, and the positron's is in the negative x-direction. So the total momentum before collision is the sum of these two.\n\nWait, but wait: Lorentz factor is gamma, and the momentum is gamma * m * v. So for each particle, their momentum would be:\n\nElectron: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e (in +x direction)\nPositron: p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p (but since it's moving in -x, it's negative: p_p = - gamma_p * m_p * v_p )\n\nWait, but since the positron has a lower gamma, but is moving in the opposite direction, I need to calculate their momenta.\n\nBut wait, since the electron and positron have the same mass (m_e = m_p), but different gammas and velocities. Hmm.\n\nWait, but wait, the positron is a particle of antimatter, but in terms of mass, it's the same as the electron. So m_p = m_e.\n\nSo, let me write down the momenta:\n\nElectron: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e (positive x)\nPositron: p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p (negative x direction, so p_p = - gamma_p * m_e * v_p )\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, wait: the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is in the negative x direction. So its momentum is negative.\n\nBut I need to find the total momentum before collision. So sum the two.\n\nSo, p_total_initial = p_e + p_p = gamma_e m_e v_e - gamma_p m_e v_p.\n\nWait, but I need to find v_e and v_p in terms of the given gammas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the relation between gamma and velocity. For each particle, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo for the electron, gamma_e =4. So v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = c * sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682 c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = c*(\u221a3)/2 \u2248 0.8660 c.\n\nSo, the electron's velocity is higher than the positron's, but since it's moving in the opposite direction, their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, but wait, the positron's velocity is in the negative x direction, so its v_p is negative? So maybe I should write v_e as positive and v_p as negative.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define the directions more precisely. Let's say the electron is moving along the positive x-axis, so v_e is positive. The positron is moving along the negative x-axis, so v_p is negative. So the positron's velocity is -v_p (but in magnitude, it's the value we calculated).\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify:\n\nElectron: moving to the right (positive x direction), velocity v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)c.\n\nPositron: moving to the left (negative x direction), so its velocity is v_p = - c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = -c * sqrt(3/4) = -(sqrt(3)/2)c.\n\nSo, their velocities are:\n\nv_e = (sqrt(15)/4)c \u2248 0.9682c,\n\nv_p = -(sqrt(3)/2)c \u2248 -0.8660c.\n\nSo, their momenta:\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\nWait, because gamma_e is 4, m_e is the electron mass, and v_e is sqrt(15)/4 c. So p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) ) = m_e * sqrt(15) c.\n\nSimilarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. Since m_p = m_e and v_p is negative, p_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) ) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, let me compute that. So sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So 3.872 - 1.732 \u2248 2.14. So the total momentum is m_e c * 2.14.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to keep it symbolic for now.\n\nSo, the total initial momentum is in the positive x direction, as the electron's momentum is larger in magnitude.\n\nNow, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E1 and E2, but the problem says they have the same value, so E1 = E2 = E.\n\nWait, no, wait: the problem says the energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. So E_photon1 = E_photon2 = E.\n\nBut photons carry momentum, and their momentum is E/(c), but direction matters. So each photon's momentum is a vector.\n\nSo, the two photons are moving in directions described as upper-right and lower-right. So, both are moving to the right (positive x direction) but one is upwards (positive y) and the other is downwards (negative y). So, their momenta are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says one is moving upper-right, another lower-right. So each photon's direction is to the right, but one is upward and the other is downward. So their momenta in the x and y directions must sum to the initial total momentum.\n\nWait, but the initial momentum is in the x direction only. So the total momentum after collision must also be in the x direction. The y components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other.\n\nHmm, right. So each photon has a momentum vector with x and y components. Let me denote the photons as photon A and photon B.\n\nPhoton A: moving in upper-right direction, so its momentum vector has positive x and positive y components.\n\nPhoton B: moving in lower-right direction, so positive x and negative y.\n\nSince the energies are the same, their magnitudes of momentum are the same because E_photon = |p_photon| * c. So, |p_A| = |p_B| = E/c.\n\nWait, no: E = pc, because for photons, E = pc. So, the magnitudes of the momenta of both photons are equal, since E is the same for both.\n\nSo, |p_A| = |p_B| = E/(c).\n\nBut their directions are different, so their momentum vectors are:\n\np_A = (p_Ax, p_Ay) = (p_A cos \u03b8, p_A sin \u03b8 )\n\np_B = (p_Bx, p_By) = (p_B cos \u03c6, p_B sin \u03c6 )\n\nBut since one is upper-right and the other lower-right, I think the angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 are measured from the x-axis. Let's say photon A has an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon B has an angle \u03c6 below the x-axis. So, their y-components would be p_A sin \u03b8 and p_B sin \u03c6, but with opposite signs if the angles are the same in magnitude.\n\nWait, but the problem says the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So perhaps they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So, \u03b8 and (360 - \u03b8) or (180 - \u03b8) or something? Or maybe they have the same magnitude but opposite signs in y.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So maybe their angles are symmetric about the x-axis. Let me assume that, for simplicity.\n\nSo, let's say photon A has an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon B has an angle \u03b8 below the x-axis. But wait, that would make their y-components opposite in sign.\n\nSo, the total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' momenta.\n\nSo, total p_total_final = (p_Ax + p_Bx, p_Ay + p_By )\n\nBut the initial total momentum is in the x direction, so the y-components of the photons' momenta must sum to zero.\n\nSo, p_Ay + p_By = 0.\n\nWhich implies that p_A sin \u03b8 = - p_B sin \u03c6.\n\nBut since the magnitudes of p_A and p_B are equal (because E_photon is same for both), and |p_A| = |p_B| = E/c.\n\nSo, p_Ay = p_A sin \u03b8,\n\np_By = p_B sin \u03c6.\n\nSo, p_A sin \u03b8 + p_B sin \u03c6 = 0.\n\nBut since |p_A| = |p_B|, let's write p_A = E/c, p_B = E/c.\n\nSo, (E/c) sin \u03b8 + (E/c) sin \u03c6 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by E/c: sin \u03b8 + sin \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, sin \u03c6 = - sin \u03b8.\n\nWhich implies that \u03c6 = -\u03b8, or \u03c6 = 180 - \u03b8, but considering the direction, if one is above x-axis and the other is below, then perhaps \u03c6 = -\u03b8. Or perhaps their angles are \u03b8 and 180 - \u03b8? Hmm, not sure. Maybe better to think that their y-components are opposite.\n\nWait, if \u03b8 is the angle above x-axis for photon A, then photon B's angle would be -\u03b8, so that its y-component is negative of photon A's.\n\nBut wait, the problem says one is upper-right and another is lower-right. So, their angles are measured from the x-axis in the upper and lower right quadrants. So, photon A could have angle \u03b8 above x, and photon B has angle (180 - \u03b8) below x? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of symmetric angles about the x-axis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two photons are emitted symmetrically about the x-axis, such that their y-components cancel each other. So, their angles are \u03b8 and ( -\u03b8 ), making their y-components opposite.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 = - sin (-\u03b8), so that p_Ay = - p_By.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the angles could be \u03b8 and (\u03c0 - \u03b8), but that would put one in the second quadrant, which is not the case here. Because the photons are both in the right half (upper-right and lower-right).\n\nSo, perhaps their angles are \u03b8 and -\u03b8, but then the lower photon would be at -\u03b8, which is in the fourth quadrant, which is lower-right. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, in that case, photon A is at angle \u03b8, and photon B at -\u03b8.\n\nThus, the y-components would be p_A sin \u03b8 and p_B sin (-\u03b8) = - p_B sin \u03b8.\n\nSo, their sum is p_A sin \u03b8 - p_B sin \u03b8.\n\nBut since p_A = p_B = E/c, then this becomes (E/c)( sin \u03b8 - sin \u03b8 ) = 0. Which satisfies the condition for y-momentum conservation.\n\nSo, that's good.\n\nNow, considering the x-components.\n\nThe initial total momentum is in the x-direction, so the sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta must equal the initial total momentum.\n\np_Ax + p_Bx = p_total_initial.\n\nWhich is:\n\np_A cos \u03b8 + p_B cos (-\u03b8) = p_total_initial.\n\nBut cos is even, so cos(-\u03b8) = cos \u03b8.\n\nAnd since p_A = p_B = E/c,\n\n(E/c) cos \u03b8 + (E/c) cos \u03b8 = p_total_initial.\n\nSo,\n\n2 (E/c) cos \u03b8 = p_total_initial.\n\nBut p_total_initial is the total momentum before annihilation, which we calculated earlier as m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, let me make sure. Earlier, I computed p_e = m_e c sqrt(15) and p_p = - m_e c sqrt(3).\n\nSo p_total_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo, 2 (E/c) cos \u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but E is the energy of each photon. So, E = p c, because for a photon, E = p c.\n\nSo, substituting E = p c into the equation:\n\n2 (p c / c ) cos \u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 p cos \u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nHmm, but what is p here? Since E = p c, and each photon has E = p c, so p = E/(c).\n\nWait, maybe I should express everything in terms of E.\n\nWait, each photon's momentum magnitude is E/c, so p_A = p_B = E/c.\n\nSo, going back to the x-component equation:\n\n2 (E/c) cos \u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nLet me solve for cos \u03b8.\n\ncos \u03b8 = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / [ 2 (E/c) ) ]\n\nWait, wait, let me re-arrange:\n\n2 (E/c) cos \u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo,\n\ncos \u03b8 = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / [ 2 (E/c) ) ]\n\nSimplify denominator: 2 (E/c) = 2 (E)/(c).\n\nSo,\n\ncos \u03b8 = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * c ] / ( 2 E )\n\nWait, because the denominator is [2 (E/c) ] so it becomes 2 E / c.\n\nWait, let me re-do the algebra:\n\ncos \u03b8 = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / [ 2 (E/c) ) ]\n\nWhich is [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] * [ c / (2 E) ) ]\n\nSo,\n\ncos \u03b8 = [ m_e c^2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / ( 2 E )\n\nHmm. But m_e c^2 is the rest energy of the electron, which is about 0.511 MeV.\n\nBut perhaps there's another approach. Because the total energy must also be conserved.\n\nThe initial total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nElectron's energy: E_e = gamma_e m_e c^2 =4 m_e c^2.\n\nPositron's energy: E_p = gamma_p m_p c^2 = 2 m_e c^2.\n\nSo, total initial energy E_initial = 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 =6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the photons have energies E each, so total energy E_final = E + E = 2 E.\n\nSo, by conservation of energy:\n\n2 E =6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E =3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo, each photon has energy E=3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So E =3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation for cos \u03b8:\n\ncos \u03b8 = [ m_e c^2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / ( 2 * 3 m_e c\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nm_e c^2 cancels out.\n\nSo,\n\ncos \u03b8 = [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / ( 6 )\n\nCompute sqrt(15) \u22483.87298,\n\nsqrt(3)\u22481.73205.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u22483.87298 -1.73205 \u22482.14093.\n\nSo,\n\ncos \u03b8 \u22482.14093 /6 \u22480.35682.\n\nSo, \u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.35682) \u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, because cos(60\u00b0) is 0.5, cos(70\u00b0) is about 0.3420. So 0.3568 would be a bit less than 69 degrees, maybe around 69 degrees.\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 2.14093 /6 = 0.35682.\n\nWhat angle has a cosine of 0.35682?\n\nLooking at a calculator: arccos(0.35682) \u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, wait, 69 degrees: cos(69\u00b0) \u22480.3584, which is very close to 0.3568. So \u03b8 is approximately 69 degrees.\n\nSo, each photon is emitted at an angle \u03b8 \u224869 degrees above and below the x-axis.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is asking for the angle between the directions of the photons.\n\nSo, photon A is at +\u03b8, and photon B is at -\u03b8. The angle between them is 2\u03b8.\n\nSo, 2 * 69 \u2248138 degrees.\n\nSo, the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOptions are A)74, B)172, C)138, D)96.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be C)138 degrees.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron collide and annihilate into two photons of equal energy, moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.\n\n### Conservation of Energy\nThe total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:\n- Electron energy: \\( E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 \\)\n- Positron energy: \\( E_p = \\gamma_p m_p c^2 = 2 m_e c^2 \\)\n- Total initial energy: \\( E_{\\text{initial}} = E_e + E_p = 6 m_e c^2 \\)\n\nAfter annihilation, the total energy is shared equally between the two photons:\n- Energy of each photon: \\( E = \\frac{E_{\\text{initial}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2 \\)\n\n### Conservation of Momentum\nThe total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron:\n- Electron momentum: \\( p_e = \\gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c = m_e c \\sqrt{15} \\)\n- Positron momentum: \\( p_p = \\gamma_p m_p v_p = 2 m_e \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c\\right) = -m_e c \\sqrt{3} \\)\n- Total initial momentum: \\( p_{\\text{initial}} = p_e + p_p = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\)\n\nAfter annihilation, the photons' momenta must conserve the total momentum.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.\n\nFirst, I remember that electrons and positrons annihilate each other, producing photons. Since they're matter and antimatter, their collision should result in energy in the form of photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy. Oh, and their directions are measured\u2014one upper-right, the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right but in different vertical directions.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the angle between their directions. So I imagine the two photons moving away at some angle from each other. The options are 74, 172, 138, or 96 degrees. Hmm, I'm not sure how to approach this.\n\nLet me think about conservation laws. Since the collision happens between an electron and a positron, their total momentum and energy should be conserved. Also, because they annihilate into photons, the photons must carry away the momentum and energy.\n\nBut wait, the electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right, along the same horizontal axis. So their initial momenta are in opposite directions. Let me compute their momenta before collision.\n\nThe Lorentz factor (gamma) is given for each. For the electron, gamma is 4. For the positron, gamma is 2. The rest mass of an electron (and positron) is about 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2, but I'm not sure if the actual mass is needed here.\n\nMomentum (p) is gamma * m * v. Wait, but in terms of units, perhaps it's better to compute the relativistic momentum using p = gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since I don't have v, perhaps I can express it in terms of gamma and the rest mass.\n\nWait, another thought: The positron has the same mass as the electron, so m_e for both. The electron's gamma is 4, so p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly for the positron, p_positron = gamma_positron * m_e * v_positron. But since the positron is moving from the right, its velocity is in the opposite direction to the electron's. So if the electron's velocity is to the right, the positron's is to the left.\n\nWait, no. The problem says the electron is moving from the left, so its direction is to the right along the horizontal. The positron is moving from the right, so its direction is to the left. So their initial momenta are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, no, wait: the problem says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so direction is to the right. The positron is moving along the same axis, but from the right, so direction is to the left. So their momenta are opposite in direction.\n\nBut since they are colliding, perhaps they meet at a point. So the total initial momentum is the sum of their momenta. Let me calculate the momenta.\n\nLet me denote the electron's momentum as p_e and the positron's as p_p. Since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta will subtract.\n\nBut wait, electrons and positrons have opposite charges, but same mass. So the electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e * v_e, and the positron's is gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But their velocities are in opposite directions. So if the electron's velocity is +v, the positron's is -u.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of vectors. Let me assign directions: let's say the electron is moving to the right (positive x-direction) with velocity v, and the positron is moving to the left (negative x-direction) with velocity u. So their momenta are in opposite directions.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving to the right, the positron is moving to the left. So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, but the problem says the electron is moving from the left, so direction is to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so direction is to the left. So their velocities are opposite. So their momenta are in opposite directions.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e (right) plus p_p (left, so negative). So p_initial = p_e - p_p.\n\nBut wait, the positron's gamma is 2, so p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p. Similarly for the electron.\n\nWait, but I don't know their velocities. Hmm. Maybe I can find the ratio of their momenta.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate their relativistic momenta in terms of gamma and mass. But I'm a bit stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the center of momentum frame. Because in the center of momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. Then, the photons would have to be emitted symmetrically or something. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nWait, but the problem says both photons have the same energy. So if their energies are the same, but they're moving in different directions, that might imply something about their angles.\n\nWait, photons carry momentum p = E / c, and their direction is determined by their angle. So the momenta of the two photons must add up to the total initial momentum of the system.\n\nBut wait, before collision, the total momentum is the sum of the electron and positron momenta.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the total initial momentum and the total energy, then use that to find the photon momenta.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nFirst, compute the initial momentum.\n\nElectron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e\n\nPositron's momentum: p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p\n\nBut since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, p_p is negative. So total initial momentum is p_e - p_p.\n\nBut I don't know v_e or v_p. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of their velocities or express their velocities in terms of gamma.\n\nWait, gamma is given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. So gamma_e =4, gamma_p=2.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).\n\nSo for the electron: gamma_e =4 =1/ sqrt(1 - (v_e^2/c^2)) \u2192 sqrt(1 - v_e^2/c^2) = 1/4 \u2192 1 - v_e^2/c^2 = 1/16 \u2192 v_e^2/c^2 = 15/16 \u2192 v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4) \u2248 0.968 c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron: gamma_p=2 \u2192 sqrt(1 - v_p^2/c^2) = 1/2 \u2192 1 - v_p^2/c^2 = 1/4 \u2192 v_p^2/c^2 = 3/4 \u2192 v_p = c * sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866 c.\n\nSo the electron's velocity is approximately 0.968c to the right, the positron's velocity is 0.866c to the left.\n\nSo their momenta:\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e =4 * m_e * (0.968 c) \u22484 * m_e *0.968 c \u22483.872 m_e c.\n\np_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p =2 * m_e * (0.866 c) \u22481.732 m_e c.\n\nBut since the positron is moving left, its momentum is -1.732 m_e c.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = 3.872 m_e c -1.732 m_e c \u22482.14 m_e c.\n\nWait, but wait. The positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so p_p is negative. So p_initial = p_e - p_p?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify the directions. Let's say the electron is moving in +x direction, so p_e is positive. The positron is moving in -x direction, so its momentum is negative. So p_initial = p_e (positive) + p_p (negative).\n\nSo p_initial = p_e - p_p = 3.872 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c = 2.14 m_e c.\n\nSo the initial total momentum is approximately 2.14 m_e c in the positive x direction.\n\nNow, the total energy. The total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nThe energy of each is gamma * m_e c\u00b2.\n\nElectron's energy: E_e =4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nPositron's energy: E_p =2 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nTotal energy E_initial =4 +2 =6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the system produces two photons. Let's denote their energies as E1 and E2. The problem states that E1 = E2 = E. So E1 = E2 =3 m_e c\u00b2 each? Wait, no, because the total energy is 6 m_e c\u00b2, so each photon would have 3 m_e c\u00b2?\n\nWait, no. Wait, 6 m_e c\u00b2 divided by two would be 3 each. So each photon has energy E =3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, photons carry momentum p = E / c. So each photon's momentum is p = E/c = 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c =3 m_e c.\n\nNow, the photons are moving in directions that are upper-right and lower-right. So one photon is moving at an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and the other at \u03b8 below the x-axis, but both to the right. Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right, but not necessarily symmetric.\n\nWait, but the problem says both photons are moving to the right, but in different vertical directions. So their momenta vectors are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively.\n\nBut since the total momentum after collision must equal the initial momentum, which is 2.14 m_e c in the x-direction. The total momentum after collision is the vector sum of the two photons' momenta.\n\nEach photon's momentum is 3 m_e c in magnitude, but their directions are at angles \u03b8 and -\u03b8, perhaps. Or maybe not symmetric.\n\nWait, but I don't know their angles yet. Let me denote the angles. Let's say photon 1 is at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 is at angle \u03c6 below the x-axis. But the problem states that one is upper-right and another lower-right, but it's possible that the angles are different. Alternatively, perhaps they are symmetric, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but since the initial momentum is entirely in the x-direction, the total y-momentum must be zero. Because before collision, the system's total y-momentum is zero. So the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero.\n\nSo the y-components of the two photons' momenta should cancel each other out.\n\nEach photon's momentum is 3 m_e c. So for photon 1, the y-component is 3 m_e c sin\u03b8. Photon 2's y-component is 3 m_e c sin\u03c6.\n\nBut the sum of these y-components must be zero, because the initial y-momentum is zero.\n\nSo 3 m_e c (sin\u03b8 + sin\u03c6) =0 \u2192 sin\u03b8 + sin\u03c6=0 \u2192 sin\u03c6 = - sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich implies that \u03c6 = -\u03b8 or \u03c6 = 180 - \u03b8, but since both photons are moving to the right, their angles are in the first and fourth quadrants, so \u03c6 = -\u03b8.\n\nSo the two photons have angles \u03b8 and -\u03b8 with respect to the x-axis.\n\nNow, the x-components of their momenta must add up to the initial total momentum of 2.14 m_e c.\n\nEach photon's x-component is 3 m_e c cos\u03b8 and 3 m_e c cos\u03c6 =3 m_e c cos(-\u03b8)=3 m_e c cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the sum of the x-components is 3 m_e c cos\u03b8 + 3 m_e c cos\u03b8 =6 m_e c cos\u03b8.\n\nThis must equal the initial momentum of 2.14 m_e c.\n\nSo:\n\n6 m_e c cos\u03b8 =2.14 m_e c \u2192 6 cos\u03b8 =2.14 \u2192 cos\u03b8 =2.14/6 \u22480.3567.\n\nSo \u03b8 = arccos(0.3567) \u224869 degrees. Wait, cos(60) is 0.5, so 0.3567 is a bit lower. So maybe about 69 degrees.\n\nWait, let me calculate 2.14 divided by 6: 2.14 /6 \u22480.356667.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 =0.3567 \u2192 \u03b8 \u224869 degrees. Let me check with a calculator. Oh wait, I can't do that right now, but I remember that cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)=\u22480.3420. So 0.3567 is between 69 and 70 degrees. Maybe approximately 69.5 degrees.\n\nSo the photons are at angles \u03b8 and -\u03b8, each about 69.5 degrees from the x-axis. So the angle between them is \u03b8 - (-\u03b8) =2\u03b8. So 2 *69.5 =139 degrees. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 138, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps my approximation is a bit off.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should calculate this more precisely.\n\nLet me compute cos\u03b8=0.3566667.\n\nWhat's \u03b8?\n\nUsing a calculator (since I can't actually compute it now, but I'll proceed as if I can), let's say \u03b8\u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, cos(69) is approximately 0.3584. So 0.3567 is a bit less than that, so \u03b8 is a bit more than 69 degrees, say 69.5 degrees.\n\nSo 2\u03b8 would be about 139 degrees. The closest option is C) 138, but maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption that the angles are symmetric is incorrect. Because the problem states that the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, but it doesn't say they are symmetric. So maybe the angles aren't exactly symmetric, but I thought that the y-components have to cancel.\n\nWait, but if the two photons are moving at different angles, then the sum of their y-components must be zero. So sin\u03b81 + sin\u03b82 =0. Which can be satisfied if \u03b82 = -\u03b81. So they must be symmetric in the y-axis. So the angle between the photons would be 2\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle each makes with the x-axis.\n\nSo in that case, the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8.\n\nEarlier calculation gave \u03b8\u224869 degrees, leading to 138 degrees. Which matches option C.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the initial momentum calculation. Maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nElectron's gamma is 4, so p_e =gamma_e * m_e * v_e.\n\nv_e is c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e^2)).\n\nWait, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 1 -v\u00b2/c\u00b2 =1/gamma^2 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 =1 -1/gamma^2.\n\nSo v_e = c * sqrt(1 -1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c \u22480.9682 c.\n\nSimilarly, positron's gamma is 2 \u2192 v_p = c * sqrt(1 -1/4) = sqrt(3/4) c= (sqrt(3)/2)c\u22480.8660 c.\n\nSo their velocities are correct.\n\nMomentum p_e =gamma_e * m_e * v_e =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= sqrt(15) m_e c \u22483.87298 m_e c.\n\np_p =gamma_p * m_e * v_p= 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c )= sqrt(3) m_e c \u22481.73205 m_e c.\n\nSince the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative. So initial momentum p_initial = p_e - p_p = sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c.\n\nSo sqrt(15) \u22483.87298, sqrt(3)\u22481.73205. So 3.87298 -1.73205\u22482.14093 m_e c. So the initial momentum is approximately 2.14093 m_e c in the x-direction.\n\nThen, each photon has momentum p_photon = E_photon /c. Since E_photon =3 m_e c\u00b2, p_photon=3 m_e c.\n\nSo the x-components of the photons' momenta add up to 6 m_e c cos\u03b8, and this must equal 2.14093 m_e c.\n\nSo 6 cos\u03b8 =2.14093 \u2192 cos\u03b8=2.14093/6\u22480.35682.\n\nSo \u03b8= arccos(0.35682) \u2192 let's compute this.\n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.35682) is approximately 69 degrees. Because cos(69\u00b0)\u22480.3584, which is close to 0.3568. So perhaps \u03b8 is around 69.1 degrees.\n\nSo 2\u03b8 is about 138.2 degrees. The closest option is C)138 degrees.\n\nSo the angle between the photons is approximately 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem states that the photons have the same energy and the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So their angles are symmetric about the x-axis, so the angle between them is 2\u03b8.\n\nSo the correct answer would be 138 degrees.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.\n\nFirst, I remember that electrons and positrons annihilate each other, producing photons. Since they're matter and antimatter, their collision should result in energy in the form of photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy. Oh, and their directions are measured\u2014one upper-right, the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right but in different vertical directions.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the angle between their directions. So I imagine the two photons moving away at some angle from each other. The options are 74, 172, 138, or 96 degrees. Hmm, I'm not sure how to approach this.\n\nLet me think about conservation laws. Since the collision happens between an electron and a positron, their total momentum and energy should be conserved. Also, because they annihilate into photons, the photons must carry away the momentum and energy.\n\nBut wait, the electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right, along the same horizontal axis. So their initial momenta are in opposite directions. Let me compute their momenta before collision.\n\nThe Lorentz factor (gamma) is given for each. For the electron, gamma is 4. For the positron, gamma is 2. The rest mass of an electron (and positron) is about 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2, but I'm not sure if the actual mass is needed here.\n\nMomentum (p) is gamma * m * v. Wait, but in terms of units, perhaps it's better to compute the relativistic momentum using p = gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since I don't have v, perhaps I can express it in terms of gamma and the rest mass.\n\nWait, another thought: The positron has the same mass as the electron, so m_e for both. The electron's gamma is 4, so p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly for the positron, p_positron = gamma_positron * m_e * v_positron. But since the positron is moving from the right, its velocity is in the opposite direction to the electron's. So if the electron's velocity is to the right, the positron's is to the left.\n\nWait, no. The problem says the electron is moving from the left, so its direction is to the right along the horizontal. The positron is moving from the right, so its direction is to the left. So their initial momenta are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, no, wait: the problem says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so direction is to the right. The positron is moving along the same axis, but from the right, so direction is to the left. So their momenta are opposite in direction.\n\nBut since they are colliding, perhaps they meet at a point. So the total initial momentum is the sum of their momenta. Let me calculate the momenta.\n\nLet me denote the electron's momentum as p_e and the positron's as p_p. Since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta will subtract.\n\nBut wait, electrons and positrons have opposite charges, but same mass. So the electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e * v_e, and the positron's is gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But their velocities are in opposite directions. So if the electron's velocity is +v, the positron's is -u.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of vectors. Let me assign directions: let's say the electron is moving to the right (positive x-direction) with velocity v, and the positron is moving to the left (negative x-direction) with velocity u. So their momenta are in opposite directions.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving to the right, the positron is moving to the left. So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, but the problem says the electron is moving from the left, so direction is to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so direction is to the left. So their velocities are opposite. So their momenta are in opposite directions.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e (right) plus p_p (left, so negative). So p_initial = p_e - p_p.\n\nBut wait, the positron's gamma is 2, so p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p. Similarly for the electron.\n\nWait, but I don't know their velocities. Hmm. Maybe I can find the ratio of their momenta.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate their relativistic momenta in terms of gamma and mass. But I'm a bit stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the center of momentum frame. Because in the center of momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. Then, the photons would have to be emitted symmetrically or something. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nWait, but the problem says both photons have the same energy. So if their energies are the same, but they're moving in different directions, that might imply something about their angles.\n\nWait, photons carry momentum p = E / c, and their direction is determined by their angle. So the momenta of the two photons must add up to the total initial momentum of the system.\n\nBut wait, before collision, the total momentum is the sum of the electron and positron momenta.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the total initial momentum and the total energy, then use that to find the photon momenta.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nFirst, compute the initial momentum.\n\nElectron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e\n\nPositron's momentum: p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p\n\nBut since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, p_p is negative. So total initial momentum is p_e - p_p.\n\nBut I don't know v_e or v_p. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of their velocities or express their velocities in terms of gamma.\n\nWait, gamma is given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. So gamma_e =4, gamma_p=2.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).\n\nSo for the electron: gamma_e =4 =1/ sqrt(1 - (v_e^2/c^2)) \u2192 sqrt(1 - v_e^2/c^2) = 1/4 \u2192 1 - v_e^2/c^2 = 1/16 \u2192 v_e^2/c^2 = 15/16 \u2192 v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4) \u2248 0.968 c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron: gamma_p=2 \u2192 sqrt(1 - v_p^2/c^2) = 1/2 \u2192 1 - v_p^2/c^2 = 1/4 \u2192 v_p^2/c^2 = 3/4 \u2192 v_p = c * sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866 c.\n\nSo the electron's velocity is approximately 0.968c to the right, the positron's velocity is 0.866c to the left.\n\nSo their momenta:\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e =4 * m_e * (0.968 c) \u22484 * m_e *0.968 c \u22483.872 m_e c.\n\np_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p =2 * m_e * (0.866 c) \u22481.732 m_e c.\n\nBut since the positron is moving left, its momentum is -1.732 m_e c.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = 3.872 m_e c -1.732 m_e c \u22482.14 m_e c.\n\nWait, but wait. The positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so p_p is negative. So p_initial = p_e - p_p?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify the directions. Let's say the electron is moving in +x direction, so p_e is positive. The positron is moving in -x direction, so its momentum is negative. So p_initial = p_e (positive) + p_p (negative).\n\nSo p_initial = p_e - p_p = 3.872 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c = 2.14 m_e c.\n\nSo the initial total momentum is approximately 2.14 m_e c in the positive x direction.\n\nNow, the total energy. The total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nThe energy of each is gamma * m_e c\u00b2.\n\nElectron's energy: E_e =4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nPositron's energy: E_p =2 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nTotal energy E_initial =4 +2 =6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the system produces two photons. Let's denote their energies as E1 and E2. The problem states that E1 = E2 = E. So E1 = E2 =3 m_e c\u00b2 each? Wait, no, because the total energy is 6 m_e c\u00b2, so each photon would have 3 m_e c\u00b2?\n\nWait, no. Wait, 6 m_e c\u00b2 divided by two would be 3 each. So each photon has energy E =3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, photons carry momentum p = E / c. So each photon's momentum is p = E/c = 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c =3 m_e c.\n\nNow, the photons are moving in directions that are upper-right and lower-right. So one photon is moving at an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and the other at \u03b8 below the x-axis, but both to the right. Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right, but not necessarily symmetric.\n\nWait, but the problem says both photons are moving to the right, but in different vertical directions. So their momenta vectors are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively.\n\nBut since the total momentum after collision must equal the initial momentum, which is 2.14 m_e c in the x-direction. The total momentum after collision is the vector sum of the two photons' momenta.\n\nEach photon's momentum is 3 m_e c in magnitude, but their directions are at angles \u03b8 and -\u03b8, perhaps. Or maybe not symmetric.\n\nWait, but I don't know their angles yet. Let me denote the angles. Let's say photon 1 is at angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 is at angle \u03c6 below the x-axis. But the problem states that one is upper-right and another lower-right, but it's possible that the angles are different. Alternatively, perhaps they are symmetric, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but since the initial momentum is entirely in the x-direction, the total y-momentum must be zero. Because before collision, the system's total y-momentum is zero. So the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero.\n\nSo the y-components of the two photons' momenta should cancel each other out.\n\nEach photon's momentum is 3 m_e c. So for photon 1, the y-component is 3 m_e c sin\u03b8. Photon 2's y-component is 3 m_e c sin\u03c6.\n\nBut the sum of these y-components must be zero, because the initial y-momentum is zero.\n\nSo 3 m_e c (sin\u03b8 + sin\u03c6) =0 \u2192 sin\u03b8 + sin\u03c6=0 \u2192 sin\u03c6 = - sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich implies that \u03c6 = -\u03b8 or \u03c6 = 180 - \u03b8, but since both photons are moving to the right, their angles are in the first and fourth quadrants, so \u03c6 = -\u03b8.\n\nSo the two photons have angles \u03b8 and -\u03b8 with respect to the x-axis.\n\nNow, the x-components of their momenta must add up to the initial total momentum of 2.14 m_e c.\n\nEach photon's x-component is 3 m_e c cos\u03b8 and 3 m_e c cos\u03c6 =3 m_e c cos(-\u03b8)=3 m_e c cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the sum of the x-components is 3 m_e c cos\u03b8 + 3 m_e c cos\u03b8 =6 m_e c cos\u03b8.\n\nThis must equal the initial momentum of 2.14 m_e c.\n\nSo:\n\n6 m_e c cos\u03b8 =2.14 m_e c \u2192 6 cos\u03b8 =2.14 \u2192 cos\u03b8 =2.14/6 \u22480.3567.\n\nSo \u03b8 = arccos(0.3567) \u224869 degrees. Wait, cos(60) is 0.5, so 0.3567 is a bit lower. So maybe about 69 degrees.\n\nWait, let me calculate 2.14 divided by 6: 2.14 /6 \u22480.356667.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 =0.3567 \u2192 \u03b8 \u224869 degrees. Let me check with a calculator. Oh wait, I can't do that right now, but I remember that cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)=\u22480.3420. So 0.3567 is between 69 and 70 degrees. Maybe approximately 69.5 degrees.\n\nSo the photons are at angles \u03b8 and -\u03b8, each about 69.5 degrees from the x-axis. So the angle between them is \u03b8 - (-\u03b8) =2\u03b8. So 2 *69.5 =139 degrees. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 138, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps my approximation is a bit off.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should calculate this more precisely.\n\nLet me compute cos\u03b8=0.3566667.\n\nWhat's \u03b8?\n\nUsing a calculator (since I can't actually compute it now, but I'll proceed as if I can), let's say \u03b8\u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, cos(69) is approximately 0.3584. So 0.3567 is a bit less than that, so \u03b8 is a bit more than 69 degrees, say 69.5 degrees.\n\nSo 2\u03b8 would be about 139 degrees. The closest option is C) 138, but maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption that the angles are symmetric is incorrect. Because the problem states that the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, but it doesn't say they are symmetric. So maybe the angles aren't exactly symmetric, but I thought that the y-components have to cancel.\n\nWait, but if the two photons are moving at different angles, then the sum of their y-components must be zero. So sin\u03b81 + sin\u03b82 =0. Which can be satisfied if \u03b82 = -\u03b81. So they must be symmetric in the y-axis. So the angle between the photons would be 2\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle each makes with the x-axis.\n\nSo in that case, the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8.\n\nEarlier calculation gave \u03b8\u224869 degrees, leading to 138 degrees. Which matches option C.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the initial momentum calculation. Maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nElectron's gamma is 4, so p_e =gamma_e * m_e * v_e.\n\nv_e is c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e^2)).\n\nWait, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 1 -v\u00b2/c\u00b2 =1/gamma^2 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 =1 -1/gamma^2.\n\nSo v_e = c * sqrt(1 -1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c \u22480.9682 c.\n\nSimilarly, positron's gamma is 2 \u2192 v_p = c * sqrt(1 -1/4) = sqrt(3/4) c= (sqrt(3)/2)c\u22480.8660 c.\n\nSo their velocities are correct.\n\nMomentum p_e =gamma_e * m_e * v_e =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= sqrt(15) m_e c \u22483.87298 m_e c.\n\np_p =gamma_p * m_e * v_p= 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c )= sqrt(3) m_e c \u22481.73205 m_e c.\n\nSince the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative. So initial momentum p_initial = p_e - p_p = sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c.\n\nSo sqrt(15) \u22483.87298, sqrt(3)\u22481.73205. So 3.87298 -1.73205\u22482.14093 m_e c. So the initial momentum is approximately 2.14093 m_e c in the x-direction.\n\nThen, each photon has momentum p_photon = E_photon /c. Since E_photon =3 m_e c\u00b2, p_photon=3 m_e c.\n\nSo the x-components of the photons' momenta add up to 6 m_e c cos\u03b8, and this must equal 2.14093 m_e c.\n\nSo 6 cos\u03b8 =2.14093 \u2192 cos\u03b8=2.14093/6\u22480.35682.\n\nSo \u03b8= arccos(0.35682) \u2192 let's compute this.\n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.35682) is approximately 69 degrees. Because cos(69\u00b0)\u22480.3584, which is close to 0.3568. So perhaps \u03b8 is around 69.1 degrees.\n\nSo 2\u03b8 is about 138.2 degrees. The closest option is C)138 degrees.\n\nSo the angle between the photons is approximately 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem states that the photons have the same energy and the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So their angles are symmetric about the x-axis, so the angle between them is 2\u03b8.\n\nSo the correct answer would be 138 degrees.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate to produce two photons of equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Momentum and Energy**:\n   - The electron has a Lorentz factor of \\( \\gamma_e = 4 \\), and the positron has \\( \\gamma_p = 2 \\). Both have the same rest mass \\( m_e \\).\n   - The momentum of the electron is \\( p_e = \\gamma_e m_e v_e \\), and the positron's momentum is \\( p_p = \\gamma_p m_e v_p \\). Since the positron moves in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative.\n   - Using \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \\), the velocities are calculated as:\n     \\[\n     v_e = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_e^2}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{16}} \\approx 0.968c, \\quad v_p = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_p^2}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} \\approx 0.866c.\n     \\]\n   - The momenta are:\n     \\[\n     p_e = \\gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e (0.968c) \\approx 3.872 m_e c, \\quad p_p = \\gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e (0.866c) \\approx 1.732 m_e c.\n     \\]\n   - The total initial momentum is:\n     \\[\n     p_{\\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = 3.872 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c \\approx 2.14 m_e c \\, (\\text{in the positive } x\\text{-direction}).\n     \\]\n\n2. **Energy Conservation**:\n   - The total energy before collision is:\n     \\[\n     E_{\\text{initial}} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.\n     \\]\n   - After annihilation, the two photons share this energy equally, so each photon has energy:\n     \\[\n     E_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{initial}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Photon Momentum and Directions**:\n   - Each photon has momentum \\( p_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{photon}}}{c} = \\frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c \\).\n   - The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, making angles \\( \\theta \\) and \\( -\\theta \\) with the \\( x \\)-axis, respectively.\n\n4. **Conservation of Momentum**:\n   - The total momentum after the collision is the vector sum of the photons' momenta. Since the initial momentum is entirely in the \\( x \\)-direction, the \\( y \\)-components of the photons' momenta must cancel:\n     \\[\n     3 m_e c \\sin\\theta + 3 m_e c \\sin(-\\theta) = 0 \\implies \\sin\\theta = -\\sin\\theta \\implies \\sin\\theta = 0.\n     \\]\n     This confirms the photons are symmetric about the \\( x \\)-axis.\n   - The \\( x \\)-components of the photons' momenta add up to the initial momentum:\n     \\[\n     3 m_e c \\cos\\theta + 3 m_e c \\cos\\theta = 6 m_e c \\cos\\theta = p_{\\text{initial}} = 2.14 m_e c.\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\( \\cos\\theta \\):\n     \\[\n     \\cos\\theta = \\frac{2.14}{6} \\approx 0.3567.\n     \\]\n     Thus, \\( \\theta \\approx \\arccos(0.3567) \\approx 69^\\circ \\).\n\n5. **Angle Between the Photons**:\n   - The angle between the two photons is \\( 2\\theta \\), as they are symmetric about the \\( x \\)-axis:\n     \\[\n     2\\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69^\\circ = 138^\\circ.\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is approximately \\( 138^\\circ \\).\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativity and particle physics. But I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nAlright, let's read the problem again. So, there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then, a positron is moving along the same axis but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and one is moving upper-right while the other is lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.\n\nHmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since both the electron and positron are moving, their rest frames are different, so conservation laws must be applied in the center-of-momentum frame or something like that.\n\nWait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. I think the first thing I need to do is find their velocities because gamma relates to velocity.\n\nGamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So, for the electron, gamma e is 4. Let me solve for v_e. Similarly, for the positron, gamma p is 2, so I'll find v_p.\n\nLet me calculate v_e first. Gamma e is 4, so 4 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2). Square both sides: 16 = 1/(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2). So 1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/16. That means v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 15/16. So v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = (c * sqrt(15))/4. Approximately 0.968c, but I'll keep it symbolic for now.\n\nSimilarly for the positron, gamma p is 2. So 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2). Square both sides: 4 = 1/(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2). So 1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/4. So v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 3/4. Thus, v_p = c * sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866c.\n\nWait a minute, the electron is moving from the left, so let's say the positive x-direction is to the right. So the electron is moving to the right with velocity v_e, and the positron is moving to the left (since it's coming from the right) with velocity v_p. Wait, no, wait. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving to the right, the positron is moving to the left, but wait, no. Wait, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving from the left (so towards the right), the positron is moving from the right (so towards the left). So their velocities are in opposite directions. So their velocities are v_e (right) and -v_p (left), but wait, no, wait: the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so its velocity is towards the left. So the positron's velocity is -v_p.\n\nWait, no, wait. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right, which means it's moving towards the left. So in terms of direction, the electron is moving to the right (positive x), and the positron is moving to the left (negative x). So their velocities are in opposite directions. So I should probably take that into account when calculating their momenta.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so direction is positive x. The positron is moving along the same axis from the right, so direction is negative x. So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nNow, I need to apply conservation of energy and momentum, right? Because when the electron and positron annihilate, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. But since they annihilate into two photons, I need to ensure that the total energy and momentum before equals that after.\n\nBut wait, in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. So in that frame, the two photons must have equal and opposite momenta, which would mean they go in opposite directions. But wait, in the problem, both photons are moving to the right (upper-right and lower-right). So that can't be in the center-of-momentum frame.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the lab frame, which is the frame where the electron is moving with gamma 4 and the positron with gamma 2. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the problem says both particles are moving along the horizontal axis, so their velocities are along x. So the initial setup is in a frame where the electron is moving to the right, and the positron is moving to the left, each with their respective gamma factors.\n\nBut wait, wait. I think I should compute the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision. Then, after the collision, the photons must carry away the same total energy and momentum.\n\nSo let's compute the total energy and momentum before the collision.\n\nEach particle's energy is gamma * m c\u00b2, where m is the rest mass. For an electron and positron, m is the same, m_e.\n\nSo the electron's energy is E_e = gamma_e * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nThe positron's energy is E_p = gamma_p * m_e c\u00b2 = 2 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo total energy is E_total = E_e + E_p = 4 + 2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nNow, the momentum: for the electron, p_e = gamma_e * m_e v_e. Similarly for the positron, p_p = gamma_p * m_e v_p, but since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative.\n\nWait, wait, wait. The positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative. So p_p is in the negative x-direction. So the momentum of the electron is positive, and the positron is negative.\n\nSo let's compute p_e and p_p.\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e v_e = 4 m_e (v_e) where v_e is positive.\n\nSimilarly, p_p = gamma_p * m_e v_p. But v_p is in the negative direction, so p_p is negative.\n\nWait, but wait, let's get the signs right. The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is in the negative x-direction. So v_p is negative. So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p, which would be negative.\n\nSo let's compute the magnitudes first.\n\nFor the electron: v_e = c * sqrt(15)/4. So v_e = (sqrt(15)/4) c.\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\nSimilarly for the positron: v_p = (sqrt(3)/2) c, but since it's moving to the left, v_p is negative. So the magnitude is sqrt(3)/2 c, but the direction is negative.\n\nSo p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) ) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nHmm, okay, so total momentum is in the positive x direction, since sqrt(15) is bigger than sqrt(3).\n\nNow, after the collision, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon, which are equal, so E1 = E2 = E_photon.\n\nPhotons carry momentum p = E / c, and their direction is determined by their angle. Since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their angles are above and below the x-axis, respectively.\n\nLet me denote the angles as theta and -theta (since they're symmetric above and below the x-axis). Wait, but in the problem statement, one is upper-right and the other lower-right, but it's possible that their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. But I'm not sure; maybe they have the same angle magnitude but in opposite directions relative to the x-axis.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that both photons are moving to the right, upper and lower. So their x-components are positive, but their y-components are opposite.\n\nSo each photon's momentum has an x-component and a y-component. Let me denote the angles as theta1 and theta2, where theta1 is above the x-axis, and theta2 is below. But perhaps they are symmetric, so theta2 = -theta1. But I'm not sure if that's the case, but given that the energies are the same and directions are symmetric, perhaps that's the case.\n\nBut let's proceed. Let me model each photon's momentum as vectors.\n\nPhoton 1: p1x = E_photon / c * cos(theta1)\np1y = E_photon / c * sin(theta1)\n\nPhoton 2: p2x = E_photon / c * cos(theta2)\np2y = E_photon / c * sin(theta2)\n\nSince the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right, theta1 is positive (say, above x-axis) and theta2 is negative (below x-axis), but perhaps they have the same magnitude. Alternatively, theta2 could be 180 - theta1 or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe theta1 and theta2 are symmetric in some way.\n\nBut I'll proceed with the general case.\n\nNow, the total momentum after collision must equal the total momentum before.\n\nSo, sum of the x-components must equal the initial p_total, and the sum of y-components must be zero, because before collision, the total y-momentum is zero.\n\nSo, sum of y-components: (E_photon/c sin(theta1)) + (E_photon/c sin(theta2)) ) = 0.\n\nWhich implies that sin(theta1) + sin(theta2) = 0.\n\nHmm, so sin(theta1) = - sin(theta2). That suggests that theta2 = - theta1, or theta2 = pi - theta1, but given that the photons are moving to the right, I think the first option is more likely. So theta2 = - theta1.\n\nSo, the y-components cancel out.\n\nNow, the x-components: p_total = (E_photon/c cos(theta1)) + (E_photon/c cos(theta2)).\n\nBut since theta2 is -theta1, cos(theta2) = cos(-theta1) = cos(theta1). So:\n\np_total = E_photon / c * [ cos(theta1) + cos(theta2) ] = E_photon / c * [ cos(theta1) + cos(theta1) ] = 2 E_photon cos(theta1) / c.\n\nBut from before, p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo,\n\n2 E_photon cos(theta1) / c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\n2 E_photon cos(theta1) = m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nBut wait, the total energy before collision is 6 m_e c\u00b2, and after collision, it's the sum of the two photons' energies. Since both photons have energy E_photon, the total energy is 2 E_photon.\n\nSo,\n\n2 E_photon = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So each photon has energy 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check that again. The initial total energy is 4 m_e c\u00b2 (electron) + 2 m_e c\u00b2 (positron) = 6 m_e c\u00b2. So the photons' total energy is 6 m_e c\u00b2, so each photon is 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo substituting back into the momentum equation:\n\n2 * (3 m_e c\u00b2) * cos(theta1) = m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m_e c\u00b2 cos(theta1) = m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c\u00b2:\n\n6 cos(theta1) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta1) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n\nHmm, let me compute that value.\n\nCompute sqrt(15): approximately 3.87298.\n\nsqrt(3): approximately 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos(theta1) \u2248 0.35682. So theta1 \u2248 arccos(0.35682).\n\nWhat's arccos(0.35682)? Let me think: cos(60\u00b0) is 0.5, so 0.35682 is less than that, so angle is greater than 60\u00b0, maybe around 69 degrees?\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can find an exact value.\n\nWait, (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6. Let me square it to see if it's a familiar cosine value.\n\nSo (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 15 + 3 - 2 * sqrt(15*3) = 18 - 2 * sqrt(45) = 18 - 2*(3 sqrt(5)) )= 18 - 6 sqrt(5).\n\nDivide by 6\u00b2=36: [18 -6 sqrt(5)] /36 = [3 - sqrt(5)] /6.\n\nSo cos^2(theta1) = [3 - sqrt(5)]/6.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's a known angle. Let me think: cos(72 degrees) is (sqrt(5)-1)/4, which is approximately 0.3090. But my value is about 0.3568, which is higher than that, so the angle is smaller than 72 degrees.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute [3 - sqrt(5)]/6 numerically.\n\nsqrt(5) is approximately 2.23607.\n\nSo 3 - 2.23607 \u2248 0.76393.\n\nDivide by 6: 0.76393/6 \u2248 0.12732.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because earlier I had cos(theta1) \u22480.35682, so cos^2 is about 0.12732.\n\nWait, wait, but 0.35682 squared is approximately 0.12732, yes. So cos(theta1) \u2248 sqrt(0.12732) \u2248 0.3568.\n\nSo theta1 \u2248 arccos(0.3568) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait, I think I'm getting mixed up here. Because the square of 0.3568 is approximately 0.1273, which matches [3 - sqrt(5)]/6.\n\nSo cos(theta1) = sqrt( [3 - sqrt(5)] /6 ). Hmm, perhaps that's a standard angle, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just compute the angle numerically.\n\nSo arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees. Let me check with a calculator.\n\nWait, I can use a calculator: cos(60\u00b0)=0.5, cos(69\u00b0)= about 0.3584. Oh, so 0.3568 is slightly less, so angle is slightly more than 69 degrees, perhaps around 69.1 degrees.\n\nSo theta1 \u2248 69.1 degrees.\n\nBut wait, the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So photon 1 is at +theta, photon 2 at -theta. So the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nSo 2 * 69.1 \u2248 138.2 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138. So that's probably the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's go back a step. The total energy after is 6 m_e c\u00b2, so each photon has 3 m_e c\u00b2. That's correct.\n\nThen, the momentum equation: 2 E_photon cos(theta1) / c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake in the sign here. Let me recheck.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\np_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, wait, let me compute sqrt(15) \u22483.872, sqrt(3)=1.732. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)= 2.140.\n\nSo p_total = m_e c * 2.140.\n\nBut in the momentum equation, the sum of the x-components of the photons is 2 E_photon cos(theta1)/c.\n\nSo 2 E_photon cos(theta1) / c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\n2 E_photon cos(theta1) = m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nAnd since E_photon is 3 m_e c\u00b2,\n\n2 * 3 m_e c\u00b2 * cos(theta1) = m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo 6 m_e c\u00b2 cos(theta1) = m_e c\u00b2 (2.140).\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c\u00b2:\n\n6 cos(theta1) = 2.140 \u2192 cos(theta1) = 2.140 /6 \u2248 0.3567.\n\nWhich brings us back to theta1 \u2248 69 degrees. So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta1, which is approximately 138 degrees. So option C is 138.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their angle relative to each other is 2 times theta1, which is 2 * 69.1 \u2248 138.2 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees, which matches.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C) 138.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativity and particle physics. But I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nAlright, let's read the problem again. So, there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then, a positron is moving along the same axis but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and one is moving upper-right while the other is lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.\n\nHmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since both the electron and positron are moving, their rest frames are different, so conservation laws must be applied in the center-of-momentum frame or something like that.\n\nWait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. I think the first thing I need to do is find their velocities because gamma relates to velocity.\n\nGamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So, for the electron, gamma e is 4. Let me solve for v_e. Similarly, for the positron, gamma p is 2, so I'll find v_p.\n\nLet me calculate v_e first. Gamma e is 4, so 4 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2). Square both sides: 16 = 1/(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2). So 1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/16. That means v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 15/16. So v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = (c * sqrt(15))/4. Approximately 0.968c, but I'll keep it symbolic for now.\n\nSimilarly for the positron, gamma p is 2. So 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2). Square both sides: 4 = 1/(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2). So 1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/4. So v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 3/4. Thus, v_p = c * sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866c.\n\nWait a minute, the electron is moving from the left, so let's say the positive x-direction is to the right. So the electron is moving to the right with velocity v_e, and the positron is moving to the left (since it's coming from the right) with velocity v_p. Wait, no, wait. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving to the right, the positron is moving to the left, but wait, no. Wait, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving from the left (so towards the right), the positron is moving from the right (so towards the left). So their velocities are in opposite directions. So their velocities are v_e (right) and -v_p (left), but wait, no, wait: the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so its velocity is towards the left. So the positron's velocity is -v_p.\n\nWait, no, wait. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right, which means it's moving towards the left. So in terms of direction, the electron is moving to the right (positive x), and the positron is moving to the left (negative x). So their velocities are in opposite directions. So I should probably take that into account when calculating their momenta.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so direction is positive x. The positron is moving along the same axis from the right, so direction is negative x. So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nNow, I need to apply conservation of energy and momentum, right? Because when the electron and positron annihilate, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. But since they annihilate into two photons, I need to ensure that the total energy and momentum before equals that after.\n\nBut wait, in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. So in that frame, the two photons must have equal and opposite momenta, which would mean they go in opposite directions. But wait, in the problem, both photons are moving to the right (upper-right and lower-right). So that can't be in the center-of-momentum frame.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the lab frame, which is the frame where the electron is moving with gamma 4 and the positron with gamma 2. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the problem says both particles are moving along the horizontal axis, so their velocities are along x. So the initial setup is in a frame where the electron is moving to the right, and the positron is moving to the left, each with their respective gamma factors.\n\nBut wait, wait. I think I should compute the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision. Then, after the collision, the photons must carry away the same total energy and momentum.\n\nSo let's compute the total energy and momentum before the collision.\n\nEach particle's energy is gamma * m c\u00b2, where m is the rest mass. For an electron and positron, m is the same, m_e.\n\nSo the electron's energy is E_e = gamma_e * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nThe positron's energy is E_p = gamma_p * m_e c\u00b2 = 2 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo total energy is E_total = E_e + E_p = 4 + 2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nNow, the momentum: for the electron, p_e = gamma_e * m_e v_e. Similarly for the positron, p_p = gamma_p * m_e v_p, but since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative.\n\nWait, wait, wait. The positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative. So p_p is in the negative x-direction. So the momentum of the electron is positive, and the positron is negative.\n\nSo let's compute p_e and p_p.\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e v_e = 4 m_e (v_e) where v_e is positive.\n\nSimilarly, p_p = gamma_p * m_e v_p. But v_p is in the negative direction, so p_p is negative.\n\nWait, but wait, let's get the signs right. The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is in the negative x-direction. So v_p is negative. So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p, which would be negative.\n\nSo let's compute the magnitudes first.\n\nFor the electron: v_e = c * sqrt(15)/4. So v_e = (sqrt(15)/4) c.\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\nSimilarly for the positron: v_p = (sqrt(3)/2) c, but since it's moving to the left, v_p is negative. So the magnitude is sqrt(3)/2 c, but the direction is negative.\n\nSo p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) ) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nHmm, okay, so total momentum is in the positive x direction, since sqrt(15) is bigger than sqrt(3).\n\nNow, after the collision, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon, which are equal, so E1 = E2 = E_photon.\n\nPhotons carry momentum p = E / c, and their direction is determined by their angle. Since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their angles are above and below the x-axis, respectively.\n\nLet me denote the angles as theta and -theta (since they're symmetric above and below the x-axis). Wait, but in the problem statement, one is upper-right and the other lower-right, but it's possible that their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. But I'm not sure; maybe they have the same angle magnitude but in opposite directions relative to the x-axis.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that both photons are moving to the right, upper and lower. So their x-components are positive, but their y-components are opposite.\n\nSo each photon's momentum has an x-component and a y-component. Let me denote the angles as theta1 and theta2, where theta1 is above the x-axis, and theta2 is below. But perhaps they are symmetric, so theta2 = -theta1. But I'm not sure if that's the case, but given that the energies are the same and directions are symmetric, perhaps that's the case.\n\nBut let's proceed. Let me model each photon's momentum as vectors.\n\nPhoton 1: p1x = E_photon / c * cos(theta1)\np1y = E_photon / c * sin(theta1)\n\nPhoton 2: p2x = E_photon / c * cos(theta2)\np2y = E_photon / c * sin(theta2)\n\nSince the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right, theta1 is positive (say, above x-axis) and theta2 is negative (below x-axis), but perhaps they have the same magnitude. Alternatively, theta2 could be 180 - theta1 or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe theta1 and theta2 are symmetric in some way.\n\nBut I'll proceed with the general case.\n\nNow, the total momentum after collision must equal the total momentum before.\n\nSo, sum of the x-components must equal the initial p_total, and the sum of y-components must be zero, because before collision, the total y-momentum is zero.\n\nSo, sum of y-components: (E_photon/c sin(theta1)) + (E_photon/c sin(theta2)) ) = 0.\n\nWhich implies that sin(theta1) + sin(theta2) = 0.\n\nHmm, so sin(theta1) = - sin(theta2). That suggests that theta2 = - theta1, or theta2 = pi - theta1, but given that the photons are moving to the right, I think the first option is more likely. So theta2 = - theta1.\n\nSo, the y-components cancel out.\n\nNow, the x-components: p_total = (E_photon/c cos(theta1)) + (E_photon/c cos(theta2)).\n\nBut since theta2 is -theta1, cos(theta2) = cos(-theta1) = cos(theta1). So:\n\np_total = E_photon / c * [ cos(theta1) + cos(theta2) ] = E_photon / c * [ cos(theta1) + cos(theta1) ] = 2 E_photon cos(theta1) / c.\n\nBut from before, p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo,\n\n2 E_photon cos(theta1) / c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\n2 E_photon cos(theta1) = m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nBut wait, the total energy before collision is 6 m_e c\u00b2, and after collision, it's the sum of the two photons' energies. Since both photons have energy E_photon, the total energy is 2 E_photon.\n\nSo,\n\n2 E_photon = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So each photon has energy 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check that again. The initial total energy is 4 m_e c\u00b2 (electron) + 2 m_e c\u00b2 (positron) = 6 m_e c\u00b2. So the photons' total energy is 6 m_e c\u00b2, so each photon is 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo substituting back into the momentum equation:\n\n2 * (3 m_e c\u00b2) * cos(theta1) = m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m_e c\u00b2 cos(theta1) = m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c\u00b2:\n\n6 cos(theta1) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta1) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n\nHmm, let me compute that value.\n\nCompute sqrt(15): approximately 3.87298.\n\nsqrt(3): approximately 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos(theta1) \u2248 0.35682. So theta1 \u2248 arccos(0.35682).\n\nWhat's arccos(0.35682)? Let me think: cos(60\u00b0) is 0.5, so 0.35682 is less than that, so angle is greater than 60\u00b0, maybe around 69 degrees?\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can find an exact value.\n\nWait, (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6. Let me square it to see if it's a familiar cosine value.\n\nSo (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 15 + 3 - 2 * sqrt(15*3) = 18 - 2 * sqrt(45) = 18 - 2*(3 sqrt(5)) )= 18 - 6 sqrt(5).\n\nDivide by 6\u00b2=36: [18 -6 sqrt(5)] /36 = [3 - sqrt(5)] /6.\n\nSo cos^2(theta1) = [3 - sqrt(5)]/6.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's a known angle. Let me think: cos(72 degrees) is (sqrt(5)-1)/4, which is approximately 0.3090. But my value is about 0.3568, which is higher than that, so the angle is smaller than 72 degrees.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute [3 - sqrt(5)]/6 numerically.\n\nsqrt(5) is approximately 2.23607.\n\nSo 3 - 2.23607 \u2248 0.76393.\n\nDivide by 6: 0.76393/6 \u2248 0.12732.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because earlier I had cos(theta1) \u22480.35682, so cos^2 is about 0.12732.\n\nWait, wait, but 0.35682 squared is approximately 0.12732, yes. So cos(theta1) \u2248 sqrt(0.12732) \u2248 0.3568.\n\nSo theta1 \u2248 arccos(0.3568) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait, I think I'm getting mixed up here. Because the square of 0.3568 is approximately 0.1273, which matches [3 - sqrt(5)]/6.\n\nSo cos(theta1) = sqrt( [3 - sqrt(5)] /6 ). Hmm, perhaps that's a standard angle, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just compute the angle numerically.\n\nSo arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees. Let me check with a calculator.\n\nWait, I can use a calculator: cos(60\u00b0)=0.5, cos(69\u00b0)= about 0.3584. Oh, so 0.3568 is slightly less, so angle is slightly more than 69 degrees, perhaps around 69.1 degrees.\n\nSo theta1 \u2248 69.1 degrees.\n\nBut wait, the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So photon 1 is at +theta, photon 2 at -theta. So the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nSo 2 * 69.1 \u2248 138.2 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138. So that's probably the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's go back a step. The total energy after is 6 m_e c\u00b2, so each photon has 3 m_e c\u00b2. That's correct.\n\nThen, the momentum equation: 2 E_photon cos(theta1) / c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake in the sign here. Let me recheck.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\np_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, wait, let me compute sqrt(15) \u22483.872, sqrt(3)=1.732. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)= 2.140.\n\nSo p_total = m_e c * 2.140.\n\nBut in the momentum equation, the sum of the x-components of the photons is 2 E_photon cos(theta1)/c.\n\nSo 2 E_photon cos(theta1) / c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\n2 E_photon cos(theta1) = m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nAnd since E_photon is 3 m_e c\u00b2,\n\n2 * 3 m_e c\u00b2 * cos(theta1) = m_e c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo 6 m_e c\u00b2 cos(theta1) = m_e c\u00b2 (2.140).\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c\u00b2:\n\n6 cos(theta1) = 2.140 \u2192 cos(theta1) = 2.140 /6 \u2248 0.3567.\n\nWhich brings us back to theta1 \u2248 69 degrees. So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta1, which is approximately 138 degrees. So option C is 138.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their angle relative to each other is 2 times theta1, which is 2 * 69.1 \u2248 138.2 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees, which matches.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C) 138.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, producing two photons with equal energy.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating and producing photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. When they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is going upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.\n\nWait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is the factor by which time dilation and length contraction occur. For the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, it's 2.\n\nBut wait, since the positron is a particle with the same mass as the electron but positive charge. So in terms of momentum, I should consider their velocities and momenta.\n\nWhen particles annihilate, they produce photons. The key here is conservation of energy and momentum. Since the system is isolated, the total momentum before the collision should equal the total momentum after. Same for energy.\n\nSo, first, let's find the momenta of the electron and positron before collision.\n\nThe Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). But since gamma is given, I can find the momentum using p = gamma * m * v. Wait, but another formula comes to mind: p = gamma * m * v = gamma * m * (beta c), where beta is v/c. Alternatively, since p = gamma m v and gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2), we can write p = (gamma m c) * beta. But perhaps a better approach is to compute the momentum in terms of gamma and m.\n\nWait, another formula: p = gamma * m * v = gamma m (beta c). But beta is v/c, so p = gamma m beta c. So, if I can find beta for each particle, I can compute their momenta.\n\nAlternatively, there's a relation between gamma and beta. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2), we can write beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2)). Let me compute beta for each.\n\nFor the electron: gamma_e =4. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682.\n\nPositron: gamma_p=2. So beta_p = sqrt(1 -1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nWait, but the electron is moving to the right (from left), so its velocity is positive, and the positron is moving to the left (from right), so its velocity is negative. So their directions are opposite.\n\nSo their momenta: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Since v_e is positive (to the right), and the positron's v_p is negative (to the left), their momenta would be in opposite directions. Wait, no: the positron is moving to the right as well? Wait, no, the positron is moving from the right towards the left. Wait, no, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving from left to right, the positron is moving from right to left. So their velocities are in opposite directions. So their momenta are opposite in direction.\n\nSo when they collide, their momenta are opposite. So the total initial momentum is p_e (to the right) plus p_p (to the left), which would be p_e - p_p (if I take right as positive direction).\n\nWait, let me compute the magnitudes. Let me assign m_e as the mass of the electron (same as positron since they're matter and antimatter). Let me write m as m_e for simplicity.\n\np_e = gamma_e * m * v_e. v_e = beta_e * c.\n\nSo p_e = gamma_e * m * beta_e * c.\n\nSimilarly, p_p = gamma_p * m * beta_p * c, but since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative, so the momentum is negative.\n\nWait, but when adding, the total initial momentum is p_e (right) plus p_p (left). So in terms of direction, p_p is negative.\n\nSo total momentum before collision: p_initial = p_e - p_p (since p_p is to the left, it's negative when considering right as positive).\n\nWait, let me get the expressions correct.\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c.\n\np_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * c, but since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative, so p_p is negative.\n\nSo p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, no, because p_p is in the opposite direction, so when you add vectors, the positron's momentum is in the negative direction. So p_initial = p_e (right) + (- p_p), because p_p is in the left direction.\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to write p_p as negative.\n\nSo, p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because p_p is in the opposite direction, so it's p_initial = p_e (right) + (-p_p) (left). So the total is p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, but let me compute each momentum's magnitude. Let's compute p_e and p_p.\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c.\n\nSimilarly, p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * c.\n\nBut since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative. So the total momentum is:\n\np_initial = p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, no, because the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so if p_e is positive, then p_p is negative. So p_initial = p_e + (-p_p) = p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of vectors. The electron's momentum is +p_e, the positron's is -p_p. So total is p_e - p_p.\n\nBut wait, actually, the positron's velocity is to the left, so v_p is negative. So beta_p is positive (since it's just the magnitude), but the velocity is negative. So the momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * c * (-1).\n\nSo, p_initial = p_e (gamma_e m_e beta_e c) + p_p (gamma_p m_e beta_p c (-1)).\n\nSo, p_initial = (gamma_e beta_e - gamma_p beta_p) m_e c.\n\nLet me compute the numerical values.\n\nGamma_e is 4, beta_e is sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682.\n\nGamma_p is 2, beta_p is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma_e beta_e = 4 * 0.9682 \u2248 3.8728.\n\ngamma_p beta_p = 2 * 0.8660 \u2248 1.732.\n\nSo p_initial = (3.8728 - 1.732) m_e c \u2248 (2.1408) m_e c.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is in the right direction, and its magnitude is about 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nWait, but wait, if the positron is moving to the left, then its momentum is negative. So if the electron's momentum is positive and the positron's is negative, then the total is p_e - p_p, as I did before.\n\nSo the initial momentum is 3.8728 m_e c (right) minus 1.732 m_e c (left, which is positive in the subtraction) gives a net momentum of about 2.1408 m_e c to the right.\n\nSo that's the total momentum before collision. Now, after the collision, the two photons must carry away momentum such that the total momentum is the same.\n\nPhotons carry momentum p_photon = E_photon / c, and their direction determines the sign. Since both photons have the same energy, E1 = E2 = E.\n\nThe problem states that one photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis but in the same general direction (right).\n\nWait, but wait, the initial momentum was to the right. So the total momentum after must also be to the right.\n\nEach photon's momentum vector is in a direction. Let me model this.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon A and photon B.\n\nPhoton A is moving in the upper-right direction, making an angle theta above the horizontal.\n\nPhoton B is moving in the lower-right direction, making an angle theta below the horizontal. Wait, but the problem says their directions are measured, but it's not specified whether the angles are the same. Hmm, but the problem says the photons have the same energy and that one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So perhaps they are symmetric in some way.\n\nWait, but the photons' energies are the same, so their magnitudes of momentum are the same: p_A = p_B = E/c.\n\nSo the total momentum after collision is the vector sum of p_A and p_B.\n\nSince the initial momentum was along the horizontal (right) direction, the total momentum after must also be along the horizontal. So the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out.\n\nAh, that's a key point. The sum of the vertical components of the photons' momenta must be zero.\n\nSo, let me model this. Let me define the coordinate system with the x-axis as horizontal (right is positive) and y-axis vertical.\n\nPhoton A has momentum components (p_Ax, p_Ay) = (p_A cos(theta), p_A sin(theta)).\n\nPhoton B has momentum components (p_Bx, p_By) = (p_B cos(phi), -p_B sin(phi)), assuming phi is the angle below the x-axis. But wait, the problem states that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So perhaps the angles are symmetric above and below the x-axis.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't state that the angles are the same. Hmm, but the energies are the same, so p_A = p_B = E/c.\n\nWait, but the problem says the photons have the same energy, so their momenta magnitudes are equal. So p_A = p_B.\n\nBut perhaps the angles are not the same. Wait, but given that the sum of their vertical components must be zero, if they have the same magnitude of momentum, their angles must be symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So, for example, if photon A is at angle theta above the x-axis, photon B is at theta below.\n\nWait, but that's only possible if their vertical components cancel. So p_Ay + p_By = 0. So p_Ay = -p_By.\n\nBut since p_A = p_B, and p_Ay = p_A sin(theta_A), p_By = p_B sin(theta_B). So p_A sin(theta_A) + p_B sin(theta_B) =0.\n\nSince p_A = p_B, this implies sin(theta_A) = - sin(theta_B). So theta_A = - theta_B, meaning they are symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nSo, for example, if one is at theta, the other is at -theta.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it says one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right, so their angles are symmetric in the upper and lower right.\n\nSo, let me assume that photon A is at angle theta above the x-axis, and photon B is at angle theta below the x-axis.\n\nThen, the vertical components are p_A sin(theta) and p_B sin(theta). But wait, since p_A and p_B are same, and their sines would be positive and negative respectively. So sum is zero.\n\nSo the total vertical momentum is zero, which matches the initial condition (since initial momentum was purely horizontal).\n\nNow, the total horizontal momentum after collision is p_Ax + p_Bx.\n\nWhich is p_A cos(theta) + p_B cos(theta). But since p_A = p_B, and cos(theta) is same for both, it's 2 p_A cos(theta).\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, no. Photon A is at angle theta above x-axis, photon B is at angle theta below, so their x-components are both p_A cos(theta) and p_B cos(theta). But since their angles are symmetric, cos(theta) is the same for both. So total x-momentum is p_A cos(theta) + p_B cos(theta) = (p_A + p_B) cos(theta). But since p_A = p_B = p, it's 2 p cos(theta).\n\nBut the initial momentum was (2.1408 m_e c) to the right. So the total momentum after collision must equal that.\n\nSo:\n\n2 p cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nBut wait, p is E/c. Since each photon's energy is E, their momentum is E/c. So p = E/c.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So E1 = E2 = E.\n\nSo each photon's momentum is E/c.\n\nSo 2 * (E/c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nWait, let me write this as:\n\n2 * (E/c) * cos(theta) = (gamma_e beta_e - gamma_p beta_p) m_e c.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated the initial momentum as (3.8728 - 1.732) m_e c \u2248 2.1408 m_e c. So the right-hand side is 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nSo:\n\n2 * (E/c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\n2 E cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c^2.\n\nWait, but the mass energy of the electron is m_e c^2. So 2 E cos(theta) = 2.1408 (m_e c^2).\n\nSo E = (2.1408 / (2 cos(theta))) m_e c^2.\n\nBut wait, what about the energy conservation?\n\nThe total energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nEach particle's energy is gamma m c^2.\n\nSo E_initial = gamma_e m c^2 + gamma_p m c^2.\n\nGamma_e is 4, gamma_p is 2. So E_initial = (4 + 2) m c^2 = 6 m c^2.\n\nAfter collision, the total energy is E1 + E2 = 2 E (since both photons have same E).\n\nSo, 2 E = 6 m c^2 \u2192 E = 3 m c^2.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Because the total energy before collision is 6 m c^2, and the photons each have E, so 2E =6 m c^2 \u2192 E=3 m c^2.\n\nSo E=3 m c^2.\n\nNow, substitute E into the momentum equation.\n\nEarlier equation from momentum: 2 E cos(theta) = 2.1408 m c^2.\n\nSubstituting E=3 m c^2:\n\n2 * 3 m c^2 * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m c^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m c^2 cos(theta) = 2.1408 m c^2.\n\nDivide both sides by m c^2:\n\n6 cos(theta) = 2.1408.\n\nSo cos(theta) = 2.1408 / 6 \u2248 0.3568.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.3568) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, let me compute that. Arccos(0.3568) is about 69 degrees. Let me double-check: cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.3420. 0.3568 is between 69 and 68 degrees. Let me calculate it more precisely.\n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees. Let's say 69 degrees.\n\nSo each photon is at theta \u224869 degrees above and below the x-axis.\n\nThe angle between the two photons would be theta (upper) plus theta (lower) = 2 theta.\n\nSo 2 *69=138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.\n",

Let me write m as m_e for simplicity.\n\np_e = gamma_e * m * v_e. v_e = beta_e * c.\n\nSo p_e = gamma_e * m * beta_e * c.\n\nSimilarly, p_p = gamma_p * m * beta_p * c, but since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative, so the momentum is negative.\n\nWait, but when adding, the total initial momentum is p_e (right) plus p_p (left). So in terms of direction, p_p is negative.\n\nSo total momentum before collision: p_initial = p_e - p_p (since p_p is to the left, it's negative when considering right as positive).\n\nWait, let me get the expressions correct.\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c.\n\np_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * c, but since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative, so p_p is negative.\n\nSo p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, no, because p_p is in the opposite direction, so when you add vectors, the positron's momentum is in the negative direction. So p_initial = p_e (right) + (- p_p), because p_p is in the left direction.\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to write p_p as negative.\n\nSo, p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because p_p is in the opposite direction, so it's p_initial = p_e (right) + (-p_p) (left). So the total is p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, but let me compute each momentum's magnitude. Let's compute p_e and p_p.\n\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c.\n\nSimilarly, p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * c.\n\nBut since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative. So the total momentum is:\n\np_initial = p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, no, because the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so if p_e is positive, then p_p is negative. So p_initial = p_e + (-p_p) = p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of vectors. The electron's momentum is +p_e, the positron's is -p_p. So total is p_e - p_p.\n\nBut wait, actually, the positron's velocity is to the left, so v_p is negative. So beta_p is positive (since it's just the magnitude), but the velocity is negative. So the momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * c * (-1).\n\nSo, p_initial = p_e (gamma_e m_e beta_e c) + p_p (gamma_p m_e beta_p c (-1)).\n\nSo, p_initial = (gamma_e beta_e - gamma_p beta_p) m_e c.\n\nLet me compute the numerical values.\n\nGamma_e is 4, beta_e is sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682.\n\nGamma_p is 2, beta_p is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma_e beta_e = 4 * 0.9682 \u2248 3.8728.\n\ngamma_p beta_p = 2 * 0.8660 \u2248 1.732.\n\nSo p_initial = (3.8728 - 1.732) m_e c \u2248 (2.1408) m_e c.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is in the right direction, and its magnitude is about 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nWait, but wait, if the positron is moving to the left, then its momentum is negative. So if the electron's momentum is positive and the positron's is negative, then the total is p_e - p_p, as I did before.\n\nSo the initial momentum is 3.8728 m_e c (right) minus 1.732 m_e c (left, which is positive in the subtraction) gives a net momentum of about 2.1408 m_e c to the right.\n\nSo that's the total momentum before collision. Now, after the collision, the two photons must carry away momentum such that the total momentum is the same.\n\nPhotons carry momentum p_photon = E_photon / c, and their direction determines the sign. Since both photons have the same energy, E1 = E2 = E.\n\nThe problem states that one photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis but in the same general direction (right).\n\nWait, but wait, the initial momentum was to the right. So the total momentum after must also be to the right.\n\nEach photon's momentum vector is in a direction. Let me model this.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon A and photon B.\n\nPhoton A is moving in the upper-right direction, making an angle theta above the horizontal.\n\nPhoton B is moving in the lower-right direction, making an angle theta below the horizontal. Wait, but the problem says their directions are measured, but it's not specified whether the angles are the same. Hmm, but the problem says the photons have the same energy and that one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So perhaps they are symmetric in some way.\n\nWait, but the photons' energies are the same, so their magnitudes of momentum are the same: p_A = p_B = E/c.\n\nSo the total momentum after collision is the vector sum of p_A and p_B.\n\nSince the initial momentum was along the horizontal (right) direction, the total momentum after must also be along the horizontal. So the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out.\n\nAh, that's a key point. The sum of the vertical components of the photons' momenta must be zero.\n\nSo, let me model this. Let me define the coordinate system with the x-axis as horizontal (right is positive) and y-axis vertical.\n\nPhoton A has momentum components (p_Ax, p_Ay) = (p_A cos(theta), p_A sin(theta)).\n\nPhoton B has momentum components (p_Bx, p_By) = (p_B cos(phi), -p_B sin(phi)), assuming phi is the angle below the x-axis. But wait, the problem states that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So perhaps the angles are symmetric above and below the x-axis.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't state that the angles are the same. Hmm, but the energies are the same, so p_A = p_B = E/c.\n\nWait, but the problem says the photons have the same energy, so their momenta magnitudes are equal. So p_A = p_B.\n\nBut perhaps the angles are not the same. Wait, but given that the sum of their vertical components must be zero, if they have the same magnitude of momentum, their angles must be symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So, for example, if photon A is at angle theta above the x-axis, photon B is at theta below.\n\nWait, but that's only possible if their vertical components cancel. So p_Ay + p_By = 0. So p_Ay = -p_By.\n\nBut since p_A = p_B, and p_Ay = p_A sin(theta_A), p_By = p_B sin(theta_B). So p_A sin(theta_A) + p_B sin(theta_B) =0.\n\nSince p_A = p_B, this implies sin(theta_A) = - sin(theta_B). So theta_A = - theta_B, meaning they are symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nSo, for example, if one is at theta, the other is at -theta.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it says one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right, so their angles are symmetric in the upper and lower right.\n\nSo, let me assume that photon A is at angle theta above the x-axis, and photon B is at angle theta below the x-axis.\n\nThen, the vertical components are p_A sin(theta) and p_B sin(theta). But wait, since p_A and p_B are same, and their sines would be positive and negative respectively. So sum is zero.\n\nSo the total vertical momentum is zero, which matches the initial condition (since initial momentum was purely horizontal).\n\nNow, the total horizontal momentum after collision is p_Ax + p_Bx.\n\nWhich is p_A cos(theta) + p_B cos(theta). But since p_A = p_B, and cos(theta) is same for both, it's 2 p_A cos(theta).\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, no. Photon A is at angle theta above x-axis, photon B is at angle theta below, so their x-components are both p_A cos(theta) and p_B cos(theta). But since their angles are symmetric, cos(theta) is the same for both. So total x-momentum is p_A cos(theta) + p_B cos(theta) = (p_A + p_B) cos(theta). But since p_A = p_B = p, it's 2 p cos(theta).\n\nBut the initial momentum was (2.1408 m_e c) to the right. So the total momentum after collision must equal that.\n\nSo:\n\n2 p cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nBut wait, p is E/c. Since each photon's energy is E, their momentum is E/c. So p = E/c.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So E1 = E2 = E.\n\nSo each photon's momentum is E/c.\n\nSo 2 * (E/c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nWait, let me write this as:\n\n2 * (E/c) * cos(theta) = (gamma_e beta_e - gamma_p beta_p) m_e c.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated the initial momentum as (3.8728 - 1.732) m_e c \u2248 2.1408 m_e c. So the right-hand side is 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nSo:\n\n2 * (E/c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\n2 E cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c^2.\n\nWait, but the mass energy of the electron is m_e c^2. So 2 E cos(theta) = 2.1408 (m_e c^2).\n\nSo E = (2.1408 / (2 cos(theta))) m_e c^2.\n\nBut wait, what about the energy conservation?\n\nThe total energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nEach particle's energy is gamma m c^2.\n\nSo E_initial = gamma_e m c^2 + gamma_p m c^2.\n\nGamma_e is 4, gamma_p is 2. So E_initial = (4 + 2) m c^2 = 6 m c^2.\n\nAfter collision, the total energy is E1 + E2 = 2 E (since both photons have same E).\n\nSo, 2 E = 6 m c^2 \u2192 E = 3 m c^2.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Because the total energy before collision is 6 m c^2, and the photons each have E, so 2E =6 m c^2 \u2192 E=3 m c^2.\n\nSo E=3 m c^2.\n\nNow, substitute E into the momentum equation.\n\nEarlier equation from momentum: 2 E cos(theta) = 2.1408 m c^2.\n\nSubstituting E=3 m c^2:\n\n2 * 3 m c^2 * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m c^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m c^2 cos(theta) = 2.1408 m c^2.\n\nDivide both sides by m c^2:\n\n6 cos(theta) = 2.1408.\n\nSo cos(theta) = 2.1408 / 6 \u2248 0.3568.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.3568) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, let me compute that. Arccos(0.3568) is about 69 degrees. Let me double-check: cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.3420. 0.3568 is between 69 and 68 degrees. Let me calculate it more precisely.\n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees. Let's say 69 degrees.\n\nSo each photon is at theta \u224869 degrees above and below the x-axis.\n\nThe angle between the two photons would be theta (upper) plus theta (lower) = 2 theta.\n\nSo 2 *69=138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate to produce two photons. The key principles are conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Momentum\nThe electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma_e = 4 \\), and the positron moves to the left with \\( \\gamma_p = 2 \\). The momentum of a particle is given by \\( p = \\gamma m \\beta c \\), where \\( \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2} \\).\n\n- For the electron:  \n  \\( \\beta_e = \\sqrt{1 - 1/16} = \\sqrt{15}/4 \\approx 0.9682 \\),  \n  \\( p_e = \\gamma_e m_e \\beta_e c = 4 m_e (0.9682 c) \\approx 3.8728 m_e c \\).\n\n- For the positron:  \n  \\( \\beta_p = \\sqrt{1 - 1/4} = \\sqrt{3}/2 \\approx 0.8660 \\),  \n  \\( p_p = \\gamma_p m_e \\beta_p c = 2 m_e (0.8660 c) \\approx 1.732 m_e c \\).\n\nSince the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative. The total initial momentum is:  \n\\[\np_{\\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = 3.8728 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c \\approx 2.1408 m_e c \\, (\\text{to the right}).\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Energy Conservation\nThe total energy before the collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:  \n\\[\nE_{\\text{initial}} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2) m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.\n\\]\n\nAfter the collision, the two photons have the same energy \\( E \\). Thus, the total energy after the collision is:  \n\\[\nE_{\\text{final}} = 2E.\n\\]\n\nBy conservation of energy:  \n\\[\n2E = 6 m_e c^2 \\implies E = 3 m_e c^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Momentum Conservation\nThe photons have equal energies (\\( E_1 = E_2 = E \\)) and equal momenta (\\( p_1 = p_2 = E/c \\)). Let the angles of the photons above and below the horizontal axis be \\( \\theta \\). The vertical components of their momenta must cancel to conserve vertical momentum, implying the photons are symmetric about the horizontal axis.\n\nThe total horizontal momentum after the collision is:  \n\\[\np_{\\text{final}} = p_1 \\cos\\theta + p_2 \\cos\\theta = 2 \\frac{E}{c} \\cos\\theta.\n\\]\n\nBy conservation of momentum, this equals the initial momentum:  \n\\[\n2 \\frac{E}{c} \\cos\\theta = 2.1408 m_e c.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( E = 3 m_e c^2 \\):  \n\\[\n2 \\frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} \\cos\\theta = 2.1408 m_e c.\n\\]\n\nSimplify:  \n\\[\n6 m_e c \\cos\\theta = 2.1408 m_e c \\implies \\cos\\theta = \\frac{2.1408}{6} \\approx 0.3568.\n\\]\n\nThus,  \n\\[\n\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons\nThe two photons are symmetric about the horizontal axis, one at \\( +\\theta \\) and the other at \\( -\\theta \\). The angle between them is:  \n\\[\n\\phi = 2\\theta = 2 \\times 69^\\circ = 138^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.  \n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nSo the setup is: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.\n\nWait, Lorentz factors. Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time and length dilate for the moving object. But how does that help here? Oh right, when dealing with relativistic particles, their energies and momenta are important.\n\nSo first, I think I should calculate the energies and momenta of the electron and positron before the collision. Because when they annihilate, the photons must carry off the total energy and momentum.\n\nElectron and positron have the same mass, right? The electron mass is about 9.1e-31 kg. But since they're moving at relativistic speeds, their energies will be gamma times the rest energy.\n\nLet me think: the rest energy of an electron (or positron) is m*c\u00b2. So for the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, gamma is 2.\n\nWait, but the positron is moving from the right. So their directions are opposite. So their velocities are in opposite directions. I need to consider their momenta accordingly.\n\nWait, no, the electron is moving from left to right, so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving from right to left, so its momentum is negative. Wait, wait, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving left to right, the positron is moving right to left. So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nSo when calculating their momenta, their directions are opposite. So the positron's momentum will be opposite in sign to the electron's, but I'll have to think about the signs.\n\nWait, but when they collide, their momenta are opposite. So the total momentum before collision is the sum of the two momenta.\n\nWait, but let's get into the numbers.\n\nElectron's gamma is 4. Its momentum p_e is gamma * m_e * v_e. But wait, alternatively, I remember that for a particle, the relativistic momentum is p = gamma * m * v. Alternatively, another formula is p = gamma * m * beta * c, since beta is v/c.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total energy and momentum of each particle, then sum them, and then see how the photons carry away that energy and momentum.\n\nBecause in the annihilation, the total energy and momentum must be conserved.\n\nSo, for the electron: gamma_e =4, so E_e = gamma_e * m_e c\u00b2. Similarly, p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e c. Beta is v/c, which can be found from gamma.\n\nWait, beta squared is 1 - 1/gamma squared. Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nSo for the electron, gamma_e =4, so beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682.\n\nSo p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e c. Let's compute that.\n\nBut wait, let me write the expressions without plugging numbers yet.\n\nElectron's energy: E_e = gamma_e * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nElectron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e c.\n\nSimilarly, the positron's gamma is 2, so gamma_p =2. So beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nBut wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So p_p = -gamma_p * beta_p * m_e c.\n\nSo the total energy before collision is E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nThe total momentum is p_e + p_p = (gamma_e beta_e m_e c) - (gamma_p beta_p m_e c).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\ngamma_e beta_e =4 * (sqrt(15)/4) = sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298.\n\ngamma_p beta_p =2 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3) \u22481.73205.\n\nSo p_total = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e c.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nAfter the collision, two photons are produced with equal energy. So each photon has energy E_photon = (6 m_e c\u00b2)/2 =3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's only if energy is conserved. But wait, the rest mass energy of the electron and positron is 2 m_e c\u00b2, and their kinetic energies add to 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 =6 m_e c\u00b2. So the total energy is 6 m_e c\u00b2. So each photon has 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, photons carry momentum. Each photon's momentum is E_photon / c. But the direction matters.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Photon 1 is moving upper-right, photon 2 lower-right. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis, perhaps. But the angle between them is what we need.\n\nWait, but each photon's momentum vector would have components. Let me model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis. Let\u2019s say photon 1 makes an angle \u03b8 above the horizontal, and photon 2 makes an angle \u03b8 below. So the angle between them would be 2\u03b8. Wait, but that depends on whether they're symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that their energies are the same, but their directions are measured as upper-right and lower-right. So maybe their angles are \u03b8 and 360-\u03b8, but in reality, since both are in the right direction, but upper and lower.\n\nWait, but the problem says one is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. So their angles relative to the horizontal are \u03b8 and perhaps 360-\u03b8, but for the sake of calculation, perhaps we can model them as symmetric above and below the horizontal.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn\u2019t say that the angles are symmetric, but just that their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So perhaps they're not symmetric, but the problem states that their energies are the same.\n\nBut each photon's momentum is a vector. The sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the total momentum of the system before collision.\n\nSo let me model each photon's momentum as vectors.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nPhoton 1: momentum vector p1 has magnitude E_photon / c, direction angle \u03b8 from the horizontal (upper right, so \u03b8 is positive, say in the first quadrant).\n\nPhoton 2: momentum vector p2 has magnitude E_photon / c, direction angle -\u03b8 (lower right, so in the fourth quadrant, but since it's moving right, perhaps \u03b8 is measured from the horizontal towards negative y-axis. Or maybe it's symmetric, but perhaps not. Hmm.\n\nWait, but if the problem says the two photons have the same energy, their momenta have the same magnitude, since p_photon = E_photon / c.\n\nSo each photon's momentum is E_photon/(c) in magnitude. Since E_photon is 3 m_e c\u00b2, so p_photon = (3 m_e c\u00b2) / c =3 m_e c.\n\nSo each photon's momentum is 3 m_e c in magnitude.\n\nNow, the sum of the two photon momenta must equal the total initial momentum, which is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nWait, the initial momentum was p_total = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nBut the photons are moving in the right direction, but their individual momenta could be in any direction. Wait, no: photon 1 is moving upper-right, photon 2 is moving lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but in different vertical directions.\n\nSo their momenta vectors are both in the right direction (positive x) and have y-components in opposite directions.\n\nSo let me break the momentum vectors into x and y components.\n\nPhoton 1: p1x = p_photon * cos(theta), p1y = p_photon * sin(theta).\n\nPhoton 2: p2x = p_photon * cos(phi), p2y = p_photon * sin(phi).\n\nWait, but the problem says one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So perhaps phi is -theta, but maybe not necessarily symmetric. Wait, no, the problem doesn't say that. So perhaps I can't assume that. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the two photons have the same energy, which means their magnitudes are the same. So each has magnitude 3 m_e c.\n\nBut the sum of their momenta must be equal to the initial total momentum. So sum the x and y components.\n\nSo total momentum after collision is (p1x + p2x, p1y + p2y) = ( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c , 0 ), because the initial momentum was along the x-axis.\n\nWait, no, wait: the initial momentum was in the x-direction. So the total momentum after collision must also be in the x-direction. So the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out.\n\nSo p1y + p2y =0.\n\nBecause the initial momentum had no y-component.\n\nSo p1y = - p2y.\n\nWhich implies that the y-components of the two photons are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\n\nSo, since both photons have the same energy, their y-components are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.\n\nSo, for photon 1: p1y = 3 m_e c sin(theta).\n\nFor photon 2: p2y = 3 m_e c sin(phi).\n\nSo p1y + p2y = 3 m_e c (sin(theta) + sin(phi)) ) = 0.\n\nSo sin(theta) + sin(phi) = 0.\n\nWhich implies that sin(phi) = - sin(theta).\n\nHmm, this could happen if phi = -theta, or phi = pi - theta, etc. But in our case, both photons are moving to the right, so their angles are in the first and fourth quadrants.\n\nWait, photon 1 is moving upper-right, so theta is positive (like 30 degrees), and photon 2 is moving lower-right, so phi is negative (like -30 degrees), but let me check.\n\nWait, if theta is the angle above the x-axis, and phi is the angle below, then phi would be -theta, making sin(phi) = -sin(theta). That would satisfy the condition.\n\nSo perhaps the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nSo then, sin(phi) = - sin(theta), which would make their y-components opposite. So the y-components cancel, which is necessary for conservation of momentum.\n\nSo then, the sum of the y-components is zero, as needed.\n\nSo, in that case, the two photons are symmetric about the x-axis, each making an angle theta with the x-axis, one above and the other below.\n\nSo, their x-components would add up.\n\nNow, the total x-momentum after the collision is (p1x + p2x) = (3 m_e c cos(theta) + 3 m_e c cos(phi)).\n\nBut since phi is -theta, cos(phi) = cos(theta).\n\nSo p1x + p2x = 3 m_e c [ cos(theta) + cos(theta) ] = 6 m_e c cos(theta).\n\nThis must equal the initial total momentum, which was (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nSo,\n\n6 m_e c cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nWe can cancel m_e c from both sides:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.\n\nLet me compute that numerically.\n\nsqrt(15) is about 3.87298, sqrt(3) is about 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos(theta) \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.35682) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, because cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)\u22480.3420, so 0.3568 is between 69 and 70 degrees.\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.35682) is approximately 69.0 degrees.\n\nWait, but wait, let me compute it exactly.\n\nWait, 0.35682:\n\ncos(69 degrees) \u2248 cos(1.204 radians) \u2248 0.3584.\n\nWhich is close to 0.3568. So theta is approximately 69.1 degrees.\n\nSo each photon makes an angle of about 69 degrees above and below the x-axis.\n\nThe angle between the two photons would be the angle between theta and -theta, which is 2 theta.\n\nSo 2 * 69.1 \u2248 138.2 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138, which matches.\n\nSo the answer should be C) 138 degrees.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nSo the setup is: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.\n\nWait, Lorentz factors. Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time and length dilate for the moving object. But how does that help here? Oh right, when dealing with relativistic particles, their energies and momenta are important.\n\nSo first, I think I should calculate the energies and momenta of the electron and positron before the collision. Because when they annihilate, the photons must carry off the total energy and momentum.\n\nElectron and positron have the same mass, right? The electron mass is about 9.1e-31 kg. But since they're moving at relativistic speeds, their energies will be gamma times the rest energy.\n\nLet me think: the rest energy of an electron (or positron) is m*c\u00b2. So for the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, gamma is 2.\n\nWait, but the positron is moving from the right. So their directions are opposite. So their velocities are in opposite directions. I need to consider their momenta accordingly.\n\nWait, no, the electron is moving from left to right, so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving from right to left, so its momentum is negative. Wait, wait, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving left to right, the positron is moving right to left. So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nSo when calculating their momenta, their directions are opposite. So the positron's momentum will be opposite in sign to the electron's, but I'll have to think about the signs.\n\nWait, but when they collide, their momenta are opposite. So the total momentum before collision is the sum of the two momenta.\n\nWait, but let's get into the numbers.\n\nElectron's gamma is 4. Its momentum p_e is gamma * m_e * v_e. But wait, alternatively, I remember that for a particle, the relativistic momentum is p = gamma * m * v. Alternatively, another formula is p = gamma * m * beta * c, since beta is v/c.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total energy and momentum of each particle, then sum them, and then see how the photons carry away that energy and momentum.\n\nBecause in the annihilation, the total energy and momentum must be conserved.\n\nSo, for the electron: gamma_e =4, so E_e = gamma_e * m_e c\u00b2. Similarly, p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e c. Beta is v/c, which can be found from gamma.\n\nWait, beta squared is 1 - 1/gamma squared. Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nSo for the electron, gamma_e =4, so beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682.\n\nSo p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e c. Let's compute that.\n\nBut wait, let me write the expressions without plugging numbers yet.\n\nElectron's energy: E_e = gamma_e * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nElectron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e c.\n\nSimilarly, the positron's gamma is 2, so gamma_p =2. So beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nBut wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So p_p = -gamma_p * beta_p * m_e c.\n\nSo the total energy before collision is E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nThe total momentum is p_e + p_p = (gamma_e beta_e m_e c) - (gamma_p beta_p m_e c).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\ngamma_e beta_e =4 * (sqrt(15)/4) = sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298.\n\ngamma_p beta_p =2 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3) \u22481.73205.\n\nSo p_total = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e c.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nAfter the collision, two photons are produced with equal energy. So each photon has energy E_photon = (6 m_e c\u00b2)/2 =3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's only if energy is conserved. But wait, the rest mass energy of the electron and positron is 2 m_e c\u00b2, and their kinetic energies add to 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 =6 m_e c\u00b2. So the total energy is 6 m_e c\u00b2. So each photon has 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, photons carry momentum. Each photon's momentum is E_photon / c. But the direction matters.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Photon 1 is moving upper-right, photon 2 lower-right. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis, perhaps. But the angle between them is what we need.\n\nWait, but each photon's momentum vector would have components. Let me model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis. Let\u2019s say photon 1 makes an angle \u03b8 above the horizontal, and photon 2 makes an angle \u03b8 below. So the angle between them would be 2\u03b8. Wait, but that depends on whether they're symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that their energies are the same, but their directions are measured as upper-right and lower-right. So maybe their angles are \u03b8 and 360-\u03b8, but in reality, since both are in the right direction, but upper and lower.\n\nWait, but the problem says one is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. So their angles relative to the horizontal are \u03b8 and perhaps 360-\u03b8, but for the sake of calculation, perhaps we can model them as symmetric above and below the horizontal.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn\u2019t say that the angles are symmetric, but just that their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So perhaps they're not symmetric, but the problem states that their energies are the same.\n\nBut each photon's momentum is a vector. The sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the total momentum of the system before collision.\n\nSo let me model each photon's momentum as vectors.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nPhoton 1: momentum vector p1 has magnitude E_photon / c, direction angle \u03b8 from the horizontal (upper right, so \u03b8 is positive, say in the first quadrant).\n\nPhoton 2: momentum vector p2 has magnitude E_photon / c, direction angle -\u03b8 (lower right, so in the fourth quadrant, but since it's moving right, perhaps \u03b8 is measured from the horizontal towards negative y-axis. Or maybe it's symmetric, but perhaps not. Hmm.\n\nWait, but if the problem says the two photons have the same energy, their momenta have the same magnitude, since p_photon = E_photon / c.\n\nSo each photon's momentum is E_photon/(c) in magnitude. Since E_photon is 3 m_e c\u00b2, so p_photon = (3 m_e c\u00b2) / c =3 m_e c.\n\nSo each photon's momentum is 3 m_e c in magnitude.\n\nNow, the sum of the two photon momenta must equal the total initial momentum, which is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nWait, the initial momentum was p_total = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nBut the photons are moving in the right direction, but their individual momenta could be in any direction. Wait, no: photon 1 is moving upper-right, photon 2 is moving lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but in different vertical directions.\n\nSo their momenta vectors are both in the right direction (positive x) and have y-components in opposite directions.\n\nSo let me break the momentum vectors into x and y components.\n\nPhoton 1: p1x = p_photon * cos(theta), p1y = p_photon * sin(theta).\n\nPhoton 2: p2x = p_photon * cos(phi), p2y = p_photon * sin(phi).\n\nWait, but the problem says one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So perhaps phi is -theta, but maybe not necessarily symmetric. Wait, no, the problem doesn't say that. So perhaps I can't assume that. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the two photons have the same energy, which means their magnitudes are the same. So each has magnitude 3 m_e c.\n\nBut the sum of their momenta must be equal to the initial total momentum. So sum the x and y components.\n\nSo total momentum after collision is (p1x + p2x, p1y + p2y) = ( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c , 0 ), because the initial momentum was along the x-axis.\n\nWait, no, wait: the initial momentum was in the x-direction. So the total momentum after collision must also be in the x-direction. So the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out.\n\nSo p1y + p2y =0.\n\nBecause the initial momentum had no y-component.\n\nSo p1y = - p2y.\n\nWhich implies that the y-components of the two photons are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\n\nSo, since both photons have the same energy, their y-components are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.\n\nSo, for photon 1: p1y = 3 m_e c sin(theta).\n\nFor photon 2: p2y = 3 m_e c sin(phi).\n\nSo p1y + p2y = 3 m_e c (sin(theta) + sin(phi)) ) = 0.\n\nSo sin(theta) + sin(phi) = 0.\n\nWhich implies that sin(phi) = - sin(theta).\n\nHmm, this could happen if phi = -theta, or phi = pi - theta, etc. But in our case, both photons are moving to the right, so their angles are in the first and fourth quadrants.\n\nWait, photon 1 is moving upper-right, so theta is positive (like 30 degrees), and photon 2 is moving lower-right, so phi is negative (like -30 degrees), but let me check.\n\nWait, if theta is the angle above the x-axis, and phi is the angle below, then phi would be -theta, making sin(phi) = -sin(theta). That would satisfy the condition.\n\nSo perhaps the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nSo then, sin(phi) = - sin(theta), which would make their y-components opposite. So the y-components cancel, which is necessary for conservation of momentum.\n\nSo then, the sum of the y-components is zero, as needed.\n\nSo, in that case, the two photons are symmetric about the x-axis, each making an angle theta with the x-axis, one above and the other below.\n\nSo, their x-components would add up.\n\nNow, the total x-momentum after the collision is (p1x + p2x) = (3 m_e c cos(theta) + 3 m_e c cos(phi)).\n\nBut since phi is -theta, cos(phi) = cos(theta).\n\nSo p1x + p2x = 3 m_e c [ cos(theta) + cos(theta) ] = 6 m_e c cos(theta).\n\nThis must equal the initial total momentum, which was (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nSo,\n\n6 m_e c cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nWe can cancel m_e c from both sides:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.\n\nLet me compute that numerically.\n\nsqrt(15) is about 3.87298, sqrt(3) is about 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos(theta) \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.35682) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, because cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)\u22480.3420, so 0.3568 is between 69 and 70 degrees.\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.35682) is approximately 69.0 degrees.\n\nWait, but wait, let me compute it exactly.\n\nWait, 0.35682:\n\ncos(69 degrees) \u2248 cos(1.204 radians) \u2248 0.3584.\n\nWhich is close to 0.3568. So theta is approximately 69.1 degrees.\n\nSo each photon makes an angle of about 69 degrees above and below the x-axis.\n\nThe angle between the two photons would be the angle between theta and -theta, which is 2 theta.\n\nSo 2 * 69.1 \u2248 138.2 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138, which matches.\n\nSo the answer should be C) 138 degrees.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron collide and annihilate, producing two photons with equal energy. The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, and we need to determine the angle between their directions.\n\n### Step 1: Energy and Momentum of the Electron and Positron\n- The electron has a Lorentz factor of \\( \\gamma_e = 4 \\), and the positron has \\( \\gamma_p = 2 \\). Both particles have the same rest mass, \\( m_e \\).\n- The total energy before the collision is:\n  \\[\n  E_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.\n  \\]\n- The total momentum before the collision is:\n  \\[\n  p_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e \\beta_e m_e c - \\gamma_p \\beta_p m_e c,\n  \\]\n  where \\( \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} \\). For the electron, \\( \\beta_e = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} \\), and for the positron, \\( \\beta_p = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\). Substituting:\n  \\[\n  p_{\\text{total}} = \\left( \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} \\right) m_e c.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Energy and Momentum of the Photons\n- After the collision, the two photons have equal energy, \\( E_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2 \\).\n- The momentum of each photon is \\( p_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_e c \\).\n- The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, making angles \\( \\theta \\) and \\( -\\theta \\) with the horizontal axis, respectively.\n\n### Step 3: Conservation of Momentum\n- The total momentum after the collision must equal the total momentum before the collision. Breaking momentum into components:\n  - Along the \\( x \\)-axis:\n    \\[\n    p_{\\text{total},x} = p_{1,x} + p_{2,x} = 3 m_e c \\cos\\theta + 3 m_e c \\cos\\theta = 6 m_e c \\cos\\theta.\n    \\]\n    This must equal \\( p_{\\text{total}} = \\left( \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} \\right) m_e c \\), so:\n    \\[\n    6 \\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}.\n    \\]\n    Solving for \\( \\cos\\theta \\):\n    \\[\n    \\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}.\n    \\]\n    Numerically, \\( \\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.87298 \\) and \\( \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73205 \\), so:\n    \\[\n    \\cos\\theta \\approx \\frac{3.87298 - 1.73205}{6} \\approx 0.35682.\n    \\]\n    Thus, \\( \\theta \\approx \\arccos(0.35682) \\approx 69.1^\\circ \\).\n\n  - Along the \\( y \\)-axis:\n    \\[\n    p_{\\text{total},y} = p_{1,y} + p_{2,y} = 3 m_e c \\sin\\theta - 3 m_e c \\sin\\theta = 0.\n    \\]\n    This ensures momentum is conserved in the \\( y \\)-direction.\n\n### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons\n- The two photons are symmetric with respect to the \\( x \\)-axis, making angles \\( \\theta \\) and \\( -\\theta \\). The angle between them is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Angle between photons} = 2\\theta.\n  \\]\n  Substituting \\( \\theta \\approx 69.1^\\circ \\):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Angle between photons} \\approx 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ \\approx 138.2^\\circ.\n  \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is approximately **138 degrees**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it involves an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce gamma-ray photons. But wait, the question is about the directions and energies of these photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy and their directions are measured\u2014one upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.\n\nWait, the setup is an electron moving from the left, and a positron moving from the right. Both are along the horizontal axis. Oh right, because electrons are negatively charged and positrons are positive, they attract each other and collide. When they annihilate, they produce photons.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. But wait, their Lorentz factors are different. The electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron has 2. Lorentz factor gamma is total energy divided by rest mass energy. So the electron's energy is gamma*m_e*c\u00b2, same for the positron.\n\nWait, but both the electron and positron have the same rest mass, right? So their energies would be 4*m_e*c\u00b2 and 2*m_e*c\u00b2. But wait, when they collide and annihilate, the total energy is the sum of their energies. So the total energy would be (4 + 2) m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2. But wait, wait, no. Wait, because when the electron and positron collide, their rest masses are converted into energy. So each has rest mass m_e, so combined rest mass energy is 2 m_e c\u00b2. But their kinetic energy is also part of the total energy.\n\nWait, but the problem says they annihilate, producing two photons. So the total energy of the photons must be the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nWait, but the electron and positron are moving towards each other, so their momenta are opposite. So the total momentum before collision is the sum of their momenta. Let me think. Each has momentum gamma * m_e * v. But since they are moving in opposite directions, the total momentum is (gamma_e * m_e v_e) - (gamma_p * m_e v_p), because the positron is moving from the right, so its momentum is in the opposite direction.\n\nWait, but let me get this right. The electron is moving to the right (from left), so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left (from right), so its momentum is negative. So the total momentum is (gamma_e m_e v_e) - (gamma_p m_e v_p).\n\nBut wait, the velocities are fractions of c. Hmm. Maybe I should express everything in terms of gamma and beta (beta = v/c). Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So for each particle, gamma is given, so I can find beta.\n\nSo for the electron, gamma_e = 4. Let me compute beta_e. Gamma = 4, so 4 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_e\u00b2) \u2192 sqrt(1 - beta_e\u00b2) = 1/4 \u2192 1 - beta_e\u00b2 = 1/16 \u2192 beta_e\u00b2 = 15/16 \u2192 beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682 c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p = 2. So gamma = 2 \u2192 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_p\u00b2) \u2192 sqrt(1 - beta_p\u00b2) = 1/2 \u2192 1 - beta_p\u00b2 = 1/4 \u2192 beta_p\u00b2 = 3/4 \u2192 beta_p = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660 c.\n\nSo the electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c. Similarly for the positron.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The momentum p is gamma m v, and since v = beta c, p = gamma m beta c. So for the electron, p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c. For the positron, p_p = gamma_p m_p beta_p c. But wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. So the total momentum before collision is p_e - p_p.\n\nSo let's compute p_e and p_p.\n\np_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = (4 * m_e * sqrt(15)/4 ) c = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\np_p = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * c = (2 * m_e * sqrt(3)/2 ) c = m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo total momentum P = p_e - p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but wait, is the positron's momentum direction considered negative? Because the electron is moving to the right, and the positron to the left. So their momenta are in opposite directions. So when I sum the momenta, the positron's momentum is subtracted. So yes, P = p_e - p_p.\n\nNow, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Let's denote them as photon 1 and photon 2. The problem states that both photons have the same energy. So their energies E1 and E2 are equal. Also, the directions are such that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but one is above the horizontal, the other below. So their angles with the horizontal are symmetric in some way.\n\nWait, but if both photons are moving to the right, their momenta vectors would have components in the x-direction (same direction as the initial momenta of the electron and positron) and in y-directions (positive and negative).\n\nNow, since the photons are moving in opposite y-directions, their y-components of momentum will be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So the total y-momentum after collision is zero, which must equal the total y-momentum before collision. Wait, the initial system's y-momentum was zero because both particles were moving along the x-axis. So the total y-momentum of the photons must also be zero. That means that the two photons must have equal and opposite y-components. So their angles from the x-axis are such that their y-components cancel each other out. So their angles are symmetric about the x-axis. One is theta above the x-axis, the other is theta below. Or maybe one is theta and the other is 180-theta, but given the directions, perhaps they are symmetric above and below.\n\nWait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving in the right direction, but one upwards and the other downwards. So their angles are measured from the x-axis towards the upper and lower directions.\n\nSo the momentum vectors of the photons would have positive x-components and either positive or negative y-components. Since the total momentum of the system must be conserved, the sum of the momenta of the two photons must equal the initial total momentum, which is P = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction. Because the initial y-momentum was zero, the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero. So, if photon 1 has a y-component of p1y and photon 2 has p2y, then p1y + p2y = 0 \u2192 p2y = -p1y.\n\nNow, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So E1 = E2. Since energy of a photon is E = |p| c, where |p| is the magnitude of the momentum vector, then |p1| = |p2|.\n\nBut wait, let's think in terms of momentum vectors. For each photon, the momentum is a vector. So p1 = (p1x, p1y), p2 = (p2x, p2y).\n\nSince E1 = E2, |p1| = |p2|.\n\nThe sum of the photons' momenta must equal the initial total momentum P. So:\n\np1 + p2 = (P, 0) \u2192 because the initial momentum is all in the x-direction.\n\nBut wait, the initial total momentum is P = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction. So the sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta must be P, and the sum of the y-components must be zero.\n\nSo, p1x + p2x = P\n\np1y + p2y = 0 \u2192 p2y = -p1y\n\nNow, because both photons have the same energy, their momentum magnitudes are the same:\n\n|p1| = |p2| \u2192 sqrt(p1x\u00b2 + p1y\u00b2) = sqrt(p2x\u00b2 + p2y\u00b2)\n\nBut since p2y = -p1y, let's denote p1y as a, then p2y = -a.\n\nSo:\n\nsqrt(p1x\u00b2 + a\u00b2) = sqrt(p2x\u00b2 + a\u00b2)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\np1x\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = p2x\u00b2 + a\u00b2 \u2192 p1x\u00b2 = p2x\u00b2 \u2192 p1x = \u00b1 p2x.\n\nBut since the photons are moving in the right direction, their x-components must be positive. So p1x and p2x are positive.\n\nSo p1x = p2x or p1x = -p2x. But since both are positive, the only possibility is p1x = p2x.\n\nWait, but if p1x = p2x, then from p1x + p2x = P \u2192 2 p1x = P \u2192 p1x = P/2.\n\nSo both photons have the same x-component of momentum.\n\nSo now, the photons' momenta are p1 = (P/2, a), p2 = (P/2, -a).\n\nThe magnitudes of their momenta are the same:\n\nsqrt( (P/2)^2 + a^2 ) = sqrt( (P/2)^2 + a^2 ) \u2192 which is the same, so that's consistent.\n\nNow, the sum of their momenta is (P, 0), which matches the initial momentum.\n\nNow, the angle between the two photons' directions can be found by looking at the angle each makes with the x-axis. Let's say photon 1 makes an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle theta below. Because their y-components are a and -a, and their x-components are the same.\n\nWait, no. Because their y-components could be different in magnitude, but in this case, the photons have the same energy, so their |p| is the same. So the angles would be symmetric around the x-axis. So theta and -theta.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If both photons have the same |p|, and their x-components are equal, then their y-components must be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. So the angles would be theta and -theta. So the angle between them would be 2 theta.\n\nBut wait, the problem says one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right, which aligns with this scenario.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, where theta is the angle each makes with the x-axis.\n\nNow, to find theta, we can look at one of the photons. Let's take photon 1. Its momentum components are (P/2, a). The magnitude is |p1| = sqrt( (P/2)^2 + a^2 ) = E/(c), since E = |p| c.\n\nBut wait, the energy of each photon is E = E_photon = (same value). Let's denote E_photon as E. So E = |p1| c = |p2| c.\n\nBut the total energy of the system after annihilation must equal the total energy before.\n\nThe total energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. The electron's energy is gamma_e * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2. The positron's energy is gamma_p * m_e c\u00b2 = 2 m_e c\u00b2. So total energy is 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the total energy is 2 E, since two photons each with energy E. So 2 E = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo each photon has energy E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo |p1| = E/(c) = 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo |p1| = 3 m_e c.\n\nBut |p1| is also sqrt( (P/2)^2 + a^2 ). So:\n\n3 m_e c = sqrt( (P/2)^2 + a^2 )\n\nBut P is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo P/2 = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.\n\nLet me compute P/2:\n\nP/2 = (m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) / 2.\n\nSo (P/2)^2 = [ m_e^2 c^2 ( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))^2 ) ] / 4.\n\nCompute (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))^2:\n\n= (sqrt(15))^2 - 2 sqrt(15) sqrt(3) + (sqrt(3))^2\n= 15 - 2 sqrt(45) + 3\n= 18 - 2 * 3 * sqrt(5)\n= 18 - 6 sqrt(5)\n\nSo (P/2)^2 = m_e^2 c^2 (18 -6 sqrt(5)) /4.\n\nSo back to the equation:\n\n(3 m_e c)^2 = (P/2)^2 + a^2 \u2192 9 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 = [ m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 -6 sqrt(5))/4 ] + a^2.\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n= m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 [ (18 -6 sqrt(5))/4 ] + a^2.\n\nSo 9 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 = (18-6\u221a5)/4 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 + a\u00b2.\n\nLet me move the first term to the left:\n\na\u00b2 = 9 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - (18-6\u221a5)/4 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2.\n\nFactor out m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 = m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 [ 9 - (18 -6\u221a5)/4 ].\n\nCompute the term in brackets:\n\n9 = 36/4. So,\n\n36/4 - (18 -6\u221a5)/4 = [36 -18 +6\u221a5 ] /4 = [18 +6\u221a5 ] /4 = 6(3 +\u221a5)/4 = 3(3 +\u221a5)/2.\n\nSo a\u00b2 = m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 * [ (3(3 +\u221a5))/2 ] \u2192 a = m_e c * sqrt(3(3+\u221a5)/2).\n\nHmm, this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find tan(theta), where theta is the angle of photon 1 above the x-axis.\n\nBecause tan(theta) = (p1y) / (p1x) = a / (P/2).\n\nSo tan(theta) = [ a ] / [ (m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) / 2 ].\n\nBut a = sqrt( [3 m_e c]^2 - [P/2]^2 ) \u2192 as found earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute tan(theta) in terms of the given variables.\n\nWait, let me compute tan(theta) = (a) / (P/2).\n\nWe have a\u00b2 = (3 m_e c)^2 - (P/2)^2.\n\nBut perhaps instead, let's compute the ratio a/(P/2).\n\nLet me compute a/(P/2) = [ sqrt( (3 m_e c)^2 - (P/2)^2 ) ] / (P/2).\n\nLet me square this ratio:\n\n[ a/(P/2) ]\u00b2 = [ (3 m_e c)^2 - (P/2)^2 ) ] / ( (P/2)^2 )\n\n= [9 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - (P\u00b2/4) ] / ( P\u00b2 /4 )\n\n= [ (36 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - P\u00b2 ) /4 ] / ( P\u00b2 /4 )\n\n= (36 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - P\u00b2) / P\u00b2.\n\nSo [a/(P/2)]\u00b2 = (36 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - P\u00b2 ) / P\u00b2.\n\nNow, compute P\u00b2:\n\nP = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo P\u00b2 = m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))^2.\n\nAs before, (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 15 +3 - 2 sqrt(45) = 18 - 6 sqrt(5).\n\nSo P\u00b2 = m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 -6 sqrt(5)).\n\nSo plugging into [a/(P/2)]\u00b2:\n\n(36 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 -6 sqrt(5)) ) / [ m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 -6 sqrt(5)) ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n36 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - 18 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 +6 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 sqrt(5) \u2192 (18 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 +6 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 sqrt(5)).\n\nFactor numerator: 6 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (3 + sqrt(5)).\n\nDenominator: m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 -6 sqrt(5)) \u2192 6 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (3 - sqrt(5)).\n\nSo [a/(P/2)]\u00b2 = [6 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (3 + sqrt(5)) ] / [6 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (3 - sqrt(5)) ) ].\n\nThe 6 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 cancels out.\n\nSo [a/(P/2)]\u00b2 = (3 + sqrt(5)) / (3 - sqrt(5)).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (3 + sqrt(5)) to rationalize denominator:\n\n( (3 + sqrt(5))^2 ) / (9 -5) ) \u2192 (9 +6 sqrt(5) +5 ) /4 \u2192 (14 +6 sqrt(5))/4 \u2192 (7 +3 sqrt(5))/2.\n\nSo [a/(P/2)]\u00b2 = (7 +3\u221a5)/2.\n\nTaking square root:\n\na/(P/2) = sqrt( (7 +3\u221a5)/2 ).\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps we can compute this numerically.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(5) \u2248 2.2361.\n\nSo compute 3\u221a5 \u2248 6.7082.\n\nThen 7 +6.7082 \u2248 13.7082.\n\nDivide by 2 \u2192 6.8541.\n\nSo sqrt(6.8541) \u2248 2.618.\n\nWait, wait, 2.618 is approximately equal to (sqrt(5)+1)/2 * 2? Wait, (sqrt(5)+1)/2 is the golden ratio, approx 1.618, but 2.618 is 1.618 + 1.\n\nHmm, but let's see:\n\nWait, 2.618^2 = about 6.854, which matches the value we had earlier.\n\nSo tan(theta) = a/(P/2) \u2248 2.618.\n\nSo theta = arctan(2.618).\n\nWhat's arctan(2.618)? Let me think. I know that tan(69 degrees) is about 2.605, which is close to 2.618. So maybe around 69 degrees. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find an exact expression.\n\nWait, tan(theta) = sqrt( (7+3\u221a5)/2 ).\n\nWait, let me compute (7+3\u221a5)/2 \u2248 (7 + 6.7082)/2 \u2248 13.7082/2 \u2248 6.8541.\n\nSo sqrt(6.8541) \u2248 2.618, as before.\n\nSo theta is approximately 69 degrees.\n\nBut wait, the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, since one is theta above and the other theta below. So 2*69 \u2248 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees. So the angle between the photons is 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. Because sometimes in these conservation problems, things can get tricky.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the fact that the two photons must have their momentum vectors adding up to the initial total momentum, and their energies equal.\n\nSince the problem states that both photons have the same energy, which is 3 m_e c\u00b2, their momenta magnitudes are equal. So each photon's momentum is 3 m_e c in magnitude.\n\nSo the two photons' momenta vectors add up to the initial momentum P = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as vectors.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as vectors p1 and p2. Each has magnitude 3 m_e c.\n\nSo p1 + p2 = P.\n\nThe magnitude of P is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nThe sum of two vectors of equal magnitude (3 m_e c) must equal a resultant vector of magnitude P.\n\nWe can model this as the law of cosines. The angle between p1 and p2 is 180 - 2 theta, but wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, if the two photons are symmetrically placed above and below the x-axis, then the angle between them is 2 theta, where theta is each photon's angle from the x-axis.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute using vector addition. Let me consider the two vectors p1 and p2 each with magnitude 3 m_e c, and their sum equals P.\n\nThe resultant vector P has a magnitude of m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nLet me compute the magnitude numerically to see what it is.\n\nCompute sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298, sqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 -1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nSo P = m_e c * 2.14093.\n\nEach photon's momentum is 3 m_e c.\n\nSo the two vectors (each 3 m_e c) sum to a vector of 2.14093 m_e c.\n\nSo the triangle formed by the two photon momenta and the resultant P has sides 3, 3, and 2.14093.\n\nWe can apply the law of cosines to find the angle between the two photon vectors.\n\nLaw of cosines: c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab cos(theta), where theta is the angle between a and b.\n\nHere, a = 3, b=3, c = 2.14093.\n\nSo:\n\n(2.14093)^2 = 3^2 +3^2 - 2*3*3 cos(theta)\n\nCompute 2.14093^2 \u2248 4.582.\n\n3^2 +3^2 = 9+9=18.\n\nSo 4.582 = 18 - 18 cos(theta).\n\nRearranging:\n\n18 cos(theta) = 18 -4.582 \u2192 18 cos(theta) = 13.418 \u2192 cos(theta) = 13.418 /18 \u2248 0.7454.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.7454) \u2248 42 degrees.\n\nWait, but this theta is the angle between the two photons as vectors. But wait, in this scenario, the two photons are moving in the same general direction, but each making an angle theta with the x-axis, one above and one below.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the angles. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the vector addition scenario, the two photon vectors (p1 and p2) are at an angle phi between them, which we just calculated as approximately 42 degrees. But wait, in reality, the two photons are symmetrically placed above and below the x-axis, so the angle between them is 2 theta, where theta is each photon's angle from the x-axis.\n\nBut wait, if the angle between the vectors is 42 degrees, that would imply that the two photons are almost aligned, which doesn't make sense because they're moving in opposite y-directions. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the vectors correctly. Let me denote each photon's momentum as vectors in 2D. Photon 1 has components (p_x, p_y), Photon 2 has (p_x, -p_y). The sum is (2 p_x, 0) which must equal P.\n\nBut earlier, I had P = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).\n\nSo 2 p_x = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nEach photon's momentum magnitude is 3 m_e c, so:\n\nsqrt( p_x^2 + p_y^2 ) = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo from 2 p_x = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), we have p_x = (m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) / 2.\n\nLet me compute p_x.\n\nAs earlier, p_x = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.\n\nSo substituting into the equation:\n\n[ (m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) /2 )^2 + p_y^2 ] = (3 m_e c )^2.\n\nSo:\n\n[ m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 ( (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))\u00b2 ) /4 ) + p_y^2 ] =9 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2.\n\nAs before, (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))^2 = 18 -6 sqrt(5).\n\nSo:\n\nm_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 -6 sqrt(5))/4 + p_y^2 =9 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominator:\n\nm_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 -6 sqrt(5)) +4 p_y^2 = 36 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2.\n\nRearranging:\n\n4 p_y^2 =36 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18-6 sqrt(5)).\n\nFactor m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2:\n\n= m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 [36 -18 +6 sqrt(5) ) ] \u2192 [18 +6 sqrt(5) ].\n\nSo p_y^2 = [ m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 +6 sqrt(5)) ] /4 \u2192 [ m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 ( 6 (3 + sqrt(5)) ) ] /4 \u2192 [3 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (3 + sqrt(5)) ] /2.\n\nSo p_y = m_e c sqrt( [3 (3 + sqrt(5)) ] /2 ).\n\nBut we're interested in the angle each photon makes with the x-axis, which is theta = arctan(p_y / p_x).\n\nSo tan(theta) = p_y / p_x.\n\nCompute p_y / p_x:\n\n= [ m_e c sqrt( 3 (3 + sqrt(5))/2 ) ] / [ ( m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) / 2 ]\n\nThe m_e c terms cancel.\n\n= [ sqrt( 3 (3 + sqrt(5))/2 ) * 2 ] / ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me compute the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2 * sqrt( (3(3+\u221a5))/2 ) \u2192 2 * sqrt( (9 +3\u221a5)/2 )\n\nDenominator: sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)*sqrt(5) - sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)(sqrt(5)-1).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can rationalize this expression.\n\nLet me compute the square of the numerator and denominator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a common factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the value numerically.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nsqrt( (9 +3\u221a5)/2 ) \u2192 let's compute 9 +3\u221a5 \u22489 +3*(2.236)\u22489+6.708=15.708.\n\n15.708 /2 \u22487.854.\n\nsqrt(7.854) \u2248 2.802.\n\nMultiply by 2 \u2192 5.604.\n\nDenominator: sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u22483.87298 -1.73205\u22482.14093.\n\nSo tan(theta)=5.604 / 2.14093 \u22482.618.\n\nWhich brings us back to the earlier calculation, where theta\u224869 degrees.\n\nSo each photon makes an angle of about 69 degrees above and below the x-axis. The angle between them is 2*69=138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it involves an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce gamma-ray photons. But wait, the question is about the directions and energies of these photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy and their directions are measured\u2014one upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.\n\nWait, the setup is an electron moving from the left, and a positron moving from the right. Both are along the horizontal axis. Oh right, because electrons are negatively charged and positrons are positive, they attract each other and collide. When they annihilate, they produce photons.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. But wait, their Lorentz factors are different. The electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron has 2. Lorentz factor gamma is total energy divided by rest mass energy. So the electron's energy is gamma*m_e*c\u00b2, same for the positron.\n\nWait, but both the electron and positron have the same rest mass, right? So their energies would be 4*m_e*c\u00b2 and 2*m_e*c\u00b2. But wait, when they collide and annihilate, the total energy is the sum of their energies. So the total energy would be (4 + 2) m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2. But wait, wait, no. Wait, because when the electron and positron collide, their rest masses are converted into energy. So each has rest mass m_e, so combined rest mass energy is 2 m_e c\u00b2. But their kinetic energy is also part of the total energy.\n\nWait, but the problem says they annihilate, producing two photons. So the total energy of the photons must be the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nWait, but the electron and positron are moving towards each other, so their momenta are opposite. So the total momentum before collision is the sum of their momenta. Let me think. Each has momentum gamma * m_e * v. But since they are moving in opposite directions, the total momentum is (gamma_e * m_e v_e) - (gamma_p * m_e v_p), because the positron is moving from the right, so its momentum is in the opposite direction.\n\nWait, but let me get this right. The electron is moving to the right (from left), so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left (from right), so its momentum is negative. So the total momentum is (gamma_e m_e v_e) - (gamma_p m_e v_p).\n\nBut wait, the velocities are fractions of c. Hmm. Maybe I should express everything in terms of gamma and beta (beta = v/c). Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So for each particle, gamma is given, so I can find beta.\n\nSo for the electron, gamma_e = 4. Let me compute beta_e. Gamma = 4, so 4 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_e\u00b2) \u2192 sqrt(1 - beta_e\u00b2) = 1/4 \u2192 1 - beta_e\u00b2 = 1/16 \u2192 beta_e\u00b2 = 15/16 \u2192 beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682 c.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p = 2. So gamma = 2 \u2192 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_p\u00b2) \u2192 sqrt(1 - beta_p\u00b2) = 1/2 \u2192 1 - beta_p\u00b2 = 1/4 \u2192 beta_p\u00b2 = 3/4 \u2192 beta_p = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660 c.\n\nSo the electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c. Similarly for the positron.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The momentum p is gamma m v, and since v = beta c, p = gamma m beta c. So for the electron, p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c. For the positron, p_p = gamma_p m_p beta_p c. But wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. So the total momentum before collision is p_e - p_p.\n\nSo let's compute p_e and p_p.\n\np_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = (4 * m_e * sqrt(15)/4 ) c = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\np_p = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * c = (2 * m_e * sqrt(3)/2 ) c = m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo total momentum P = p_e - p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but wait, is the positron's momentum direction considered negative? Because the electron is moving to the right, and the positron to the left. So their momenta are in opposite directions. So when I sum the momenta, the positron's momentum is subtracted. So yes, P = p_e - p_p.\n\nNow, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Let's denote them as photon 1 and photon 2. The problem states that both photons have the same energy. So their energies E1 and E2 are equal. Also, the directions are such that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but one is above the horizontal, the other below. So their angles with the horizontal are symmetric in some way.\n\nWait, but if both photons are moving to the right, their momenta vectors would have components in the x-direction (same direction as the initial momenta of the electron and positron) and in y-directions (positive and negative).\n\nNow, since the photons are moving in opposite y-directions, their y-components of momentum will be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So the total y-momentum after collision is zero, which must equal the total y-momentum before collision. Wait, the initial system's y-momentum was zero because both particles were moving along the x-axis. So the total y-momentum of the photons must also be zero. That means that the two photons must have equal and opposite y-components. So their angles from the x-axis are such that their y-components cancel each other out. So their angles are symmetric about the x-axis. One is theta above the x-axis, the other is theta below. Or maybe one is theta and the other is 180-theta, but given the directions, perhaps they are symmetric above and below.\n\nWait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving in the right direction, but one upwards and the other downwards. So their angles are measured from the x-axis towards the upper and lower directions.\n\nSo the momentum vectors of the photons would have positive x-components and either positive or negative y-components. Since the total momentum of the system must be conserved, the sum of the momenta of the two photons must equal the initial total momentum, which is P = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction. Because the initial y-momentum was zero, the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero. So, if photon 1 has a y-component of p1y and photon 2 has p2y, then p1y + p2y = 0 \u2192 p2y = -p1y.\n\nNow, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So E1 = E2. Since energy of a photon is E = |p| c, where |p| is the magnitude of the momentum vector, then |p1| = |p2|.\n\nBut wait, let's think in terms of momentum vectors. For each photon, the momentum is a vector. So p1 = (p1x, p1y), p2 = (p2x, p2y).\n\nSince E1 = E2, |p1| = |p2|.\n\nThe sum of the photons' momenta must equal the initial total momentum P. So:\n\np1 + p2 = (P, 0) \u2192 because the initial momentum is all in the x-direction.\n\nBut wait, the initial total momentum is P = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction. So the sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta must be P, and the sum of the y-components must be zero.\n\nSo, p1x + p2x = P\n\np1y + p2y = 0 \u2192 p2y = -p1y\n\nNow, because both photons have the same energy, their momentum magnitudes are the same:\n\n|p1| = |p2| \u2192 sqrt(p1x\u00b2 + p1y\u00b2) = sqrt(p2x\u00b2 + p2y\u00b2)\n\nBut since p2y = -p1y, let's denote p1y as a, then p2y = -a.\n\nSo:\n\nsqrt(p1x\u00b2 + a\u00b2) = sqrt(p2x\u00b2 + a\u00b2)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\np1x\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = p2x\u00b2 + a\u00b2 \u2192 p1x\u00b2 = p2x\u00b2 \u2192 p1x = \u00b1 p2x.\n\nBut since the photons are moving in the right direction, their x-components must be positive. So p1x and p2x are positive.\n\nSo p1x = p2x or p1x = -p2x. But since both are positive, the only possibility is p1x = p2x.\n\nWait, but if p1x = p2x, then from p1x + p2x = P \u2192 2 p1x = P \u2192 p1x = P/2.\n\nSo both photons have the same x-component of momentum.\n\nSo now, the photons' momenta are p1 = (P/2, a), p2 = (P/2, -a).\n\nThe magnitudes of their momenta are the same:\n\nsqrt( (P/2)^2 + a^2 ) = sqrt( (P/2)^2 + a^2 ) \u2192 which is the same, so that's consistent.\n\nNow, the sum of their momenta is (P, 0), which matches the initial momentum.\n\nNow, the angle between the two photons' directions can be found by looking at the angle each makes with the x-axis. Let's say photon 1 makes an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle theta below. Because their y-components are a and -a, and their x-components are the same.\n\nWait, no. Because their y-components could be different in magnitude, but in this case, the photons have the same energy, so their |p| is the same. So the angles would be symmetric around the x-axis. So theta and -theta.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If both photons have the same |p|, and their x-components are equal, then their y-components must be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. So the angles would be theta and -theta. So the angle between them would be 2 theta.\n\nBut wait, the problem says one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right, which aligns with this scenario.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, where theta is the angle each makes with the x-axis.\n\nNow, to find theta, we can look at one of the photons. Let's take photon 1. Its momentum components are (P/2, a). The magnitude is |p1| = sqrt( (P/2)^2 + a^2 ) = E/(c), since E = |p| c.\n\nBut wait, the energy of each photon is E = E_photon = (same value). Let's denote E_photon as E. So E = |p1| c = |p2| c.\n\nBut the total energy of the system after annihilation must equal the total energy before.\n\nThe total energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. The electron's energy is gamma_e * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2. The positron's energy is gamma_p * m_e c\u00b2 = 2 m_e c\u00b2. So total energy is 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the total energy is 2 E, since two photons each with energy E. So 2 E = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo each photon has energy E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo |p1| = E/(c) = 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo |p1| = 3 m_e c.\n\nBut |p1| is also sqrt( (P/2)^2 + a^2 ). So:\n\n3 m_e c = sqrt( (P/2)^2 + a^2 )\n\nBut P is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo P/2 = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.\n\nLet me compute P/2:\n\nP/2 = (m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) / 2.\n\nSo (P/2)^2 = [ m_e^2 c^2 ( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))^2 ) ] / 4.\n\nCompute (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))^2:\n\n= (sqrt(15))^2 - 2 sqrt(15) sqrt(3) + (sqrt(3))^2\n= 15 - 2 sqrt(45) + 3\n= 18 - 2 * 3 * sqrt(5)\n= 18 - 6 sqrt(5)\n\nSo (P/2)^2 = m_e^2 c^2 (18 -6 sqrt(5)) /4.\n\nSo back to the equation:\n\n(3 m_e c)^2 = (P/2)^2 + a^2 \u2192 9 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 = [ m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 -6 sqrt(5))/4 ] + a^2.\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n= m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 [ (18 -6 sqrt(5))/4 ] + a^2.\n\nSo 9 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 = (18-6\u221a5)/4 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 + a\u00b2.\n\nLet me move the first term to the left:\n\na\u00b2 = 9 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - (18-6\u221a5)/4 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2.\n\nFactor out m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 = m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 [ 9 - (18 -6\u221a5)/4 ].\n\nCompute the term in brackets:\n\n9 = 36/4. So,\n\n36/4 - (18 -6\u221a5)/4 = [36 -18 +6\u221a5 ] /4 = [18 +6\u221a5 ] /4 = 6(3 +\u221a5)/4 = 3(3 +\u221a5)/2.\n\nSo a\u00b2 = m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 * [ (3(3 +\u221a5))/2 ] \u2192 a = m_e c * sqrt(3(3+\u221a5)/2).\n\nHmm, this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find tan(theta), where theta is the angle of photon 1 above the x-axis.\n\nBecause tan(theta) = (p1y) / (p1x) = a / (P/2).\n\nSo tan(theta) = [ a ] / [ (m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) / 2 ].\n\nBut a = sqrt( [3 m_e c]^2 - [P/2]^2 ) \u2192 as found earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute tan(theta) in terms of the given variables.\n\nWait, let me compute tan(theta) = (a) / (P/2).\n\nWe have a\u00b2 = (3 m_e c)^2 - (P/2)^2.\n\nBut perhaps instead, let's compute the ratio a/(P/2).\n\nLet me compute a/(P/2) = [ sqrt( (3 m_e c)^2 - (P/2)^2 ) ] / (P/2).\n\nLet me square this ratio:\n\n[ a/(P/2) ]\u00b2 = [ (3 m_e c)^2 - (P/2)^2 ) ] / ( (P/2)^2 )\n\n= [9 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - (P\u00b2/4) ] / ( P\u00b2 /4 )\n\n= [ (36 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - P\u00b2 ) /4 ] / ( P\u00b2 /4 )\n\n= (36 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - P\u00b2) / P\u00b2.\n\nSo [a/(P/2)]\u00b2 = (36 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - P\u00b2 ) / P\u00b2.\n\nNow, compute P\u00b2:\n\nP = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo P\u00b2 = m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))^2.\n\nAs before, (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 15 +3 - 2 sqrt(45) = 18 - 6 sqrt(5).\n\nSo P\u00b2 = m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 -6 sqrt(5)).\n\nSo plugging into [a/(P/2)]\u00b2:\n\n(36 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 -6 sqrt(5)) ) / [ m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 -6 sqrt(5)) ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n36 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - 18 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 +6 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 sqrt(5) \u2192 (18 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 +6 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 sqrt(5)).\n\nFactor numerator: 6 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (3 + sqrt(5)).\n\nDenominator: m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 -6 sqrt(5)) \u2192 6 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (3 - sqrt(5)).\n\nSo [a/(P/2)]\u00b2 = [6 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (3 + sqrt(5)) ] / [6 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (3 - sqrt(5)) ) ].\n\nThe 6 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 cancels out.\n\nSo [a/(P/2)]\u00b2 = (3 + sqrt(5)) / (3 - sqrt(5)).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (3 + sqrt(5)) to rationalize denominator:\n\n( (3 + sqrt(5))^2 ) / (9 -5) ) \u2192 (9 +6 sqrt(5) +5 ) /4 \u2192 (14 +6 sqrt(5))/4 \u2192 (7 +3 sqrt(5))/2.\n\nSo [a/(P/2)]\u00b2 = (7 +3\u221a5)/2.\n\nTaking square root:\n\na/(P/2) = sqrt( (7 +3\u221a5)/2 ).\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps we can compute this numerically.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(5) \u2248 2.2361.\n\nSo compute 3\u221a5 \u2248 6.7082.\n\nThen 7 +6.7082 \u2248 13.7082.\n\nDivide by 2 \u2192 6.8541.\n\nSo sqrt(6.8541) \u2248 2.618.\n\nWait, wait, 2.618 is approximately equal to (sqrt(5)+1)/2 * 2? Wait, (sqrt(5)+1)/2 is the golden ratio, approx 1.618, but 2.618 is 1.618 + 1.\n\nHmm, but let's see:\n\nWait, 2.618^2 = about 6.854, which matches the value we had earlier.\n\nSo tan(theta) = a/(P/2) \u2248 2.618.\n\nSo theta = arctan(2.618).\n\nWhat's arctan(2.618)? Let me think. I know that tan(69 degrees) is about 2.605, which is close to 2.618. So maybe around 69 degrees. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find an exact expression.\n\nWait, tan(theta) = sqrt( (7+3\u221a5)/2 ).\n\nWait, let me compute (7+3\u221a5)/2 \u2248 (7 + 6.7082)/2 \u2248 13.7082/2 \u2248 6.8541.\n\nSo sqrt(6.8541) \u2248 2.618, as before.\n\nSo theta is approximately 69 degrees.\n\nBut wait, the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, since one is theta above and the other theta below. So 2*69 \u2248 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees. So the angle between the photons is 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. Because sometimes in these conservation problems, things can get tricky.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the fact that the two photons must have their momentum vectors adding up to the initial total momentum, and their energies equal.\n\nSince the problem states that both photons have the same energy, which is 3 m_e c\u00b2, their momenta magnitudes are equal. So each photon's momentum is 3 m_e c in magnitude.\n\nSo the two photons' momenta vectors add up to the initial momentum P = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as vectors.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as vectors p1 and p2. Each has magnitude 3 m_e c.\n\nSo p1 + p2 = P.\n\nThe magnitude of P is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nThe sum of two vectors of equal magnitude (3 m_e c) must equal a resultant vector of magnitude P.\n\nWe can model this as the law of cosines. The angle between p1 and p2 is 180 - 2 theta, but wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, if the two photons are symmetrically placed above and below the x-axis, then the angle between them is 2 theta, where theta is each photon's angle from the x-axis.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute using vector addition. Let me consider the two vectors p1 and p2 each with magnitude 3 m_e c, and their sum equals P.\n\nThe resultant vector P has a magnitude of m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nLet me compute the magnitude numerically to see what it is.\n\nCompute sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298, sqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 -1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nSo P = m_e c * 2.14093.\n\nEach photon's momentum is 3 m_e c.\n\nSo the two vectors (each 3 m_e c) sum to a vector of 2.14093 m_e c.\n\nSo the triangle formed by the two photon momenta and the resultant P has sides 3, 3, and 2.14093.\n\nWe can apply the law of cosines to find the angle between the two photon vectors.\n\nLaw of cosines: c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab cos(theta), where theta is the angle between a and b.\n\nHere, a = 3, b=3, c = 2.14093.\n\nSo:\n\n(2.14093)^2 = 3^2 +3^2 - 2*3*3 cos(theta)\n\nCompute 2.14093^2 \u2248 4.582.\n\n3^2 +3^2 = 9+9=18.\n\nSo 4.582 = 18 - 18 cos(theta).\n\nRearranging:\n\n18 cos(theta) = 18 -4.582 \u2192 18 cos(theta) = 13.418 \u2192 cos(theta) = 13.418 /18 \u2248 0.7454.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.7454) \u2248 42 degrees.\n\nWait, but this theta is the angle between the two photons as vectors. But wait, in this scenario, the two photons are moving in the same general direction, but each making an angle theta with the x-axis, one above and one below.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the angles. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the vector addition scenario, the two photon vectors (p1 and p2) are at an angle phi between them, which we just calculated as approximately 42 degrees. But wait, in reality, the two photons are symmetrically placed above and below the x-axis, so the angle between them is 2 theta, where theta is each photon's angle from the x-axis.\n\nBut wait, if the angle between the vectors is 42 degrees, that would imply that the two photons are almost aligned, which doesn't make sense because they're moving in opposite y-directions. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the vectors correctly. Let me denote each photon's momentum as vectors in 2D. Photon 1 has components (p_x, p_y), Photon 2 has (p_x, -p_y). The sum is (2 p_x, 0) which must equal P.\n\nBut earlier, I had P = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).\n\nSo 2 p_x = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nEach photon's momentum magnitude is 3 m_e c, so:\n\nsqrt( p_x^2 + p_y^2 ) = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo from 2 p_x = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), we have p_x = (m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) / 2.\n\nLet me compute p_x.\n\nAs earlier, p_x = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.\n\nSo substituting into the equation:\n\n[ (m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) /2 )^2 + p_y^2 ] = (3 m_e c )^2.\n\nSo:\n\n[ m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 ( (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))\u00b2 ) /4 ) + p_y^2 ] =9 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2.\n\nAs before, (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))^2 = 18 -6 sqrt(5).\n\nSo:\n\nm_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 -6 sqrt(5))/4 + p_y^2 =9 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominator:\n\nm_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 -6 sqrt(5)) +4 p_y^2 = 36 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2.\n\nRearranging:\n\n4 p_y^2 =36 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 - m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18-6 sqrt(5)).\n\nFactor m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2:\n\n= m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 [36 -18 +6 sqrt(5) ) ] \u2192 [18 +6 sqrt(5) ].\n\nSo p_y^2 = [ m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (18 +6 sqrt(5)) ] /4 \u2192 [ m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 ( 6 (3 + sqrt(5)) ) ] /4 \u2192 [3 m_e\u00b2 c\u00b2 (3 + sqrt(5)) ] /2.\n\nSo p_y = m_e c sqrt( [3 (3 + sqrt(5)) ] /2 ).\n\nBut we're interested in the angle each photon makes with the x-axis, which is theta = arctan(p_y / p_x).\n\nSo tan(theta) = p_y / p_x.\n\nCompute p_y / p_x:\n\n= [ m_e c sqrt( 3 (3 + sqrt(5))/2 ) ] / [ ( m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) / 2 ]\n\nThe m_e c terms cancel.\n\n= [ sqrt( 3 (3 + sqrt(5))/2 ) * 2 ] / ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me compute the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2 * sqrt( (3(3+\u221a5))/2 ) \u2192 2 * sqrt( (9 +3\u221a5)/2 )\n\nDenominator: sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)*sqrt(5) - sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)(sqrt(5)-1).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can rationalize this expression.\n\nLet me compute the square of the numerator and denominator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a common factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the value numerically.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nsqrt( (9 +3\u221a5)/2 ) \u2192 let's compute 9 +3\u221a5 \u22489 +3*(2.236)\u22489+6.708=15.708.\n\n15.708 /2 \u22487.854.\n\nsqrt(7.854) \u2248 2.802.\n\nMultiply by 2 \u2192 5.604.\n\nDenominator: sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u22483.87298 -1.73205\u22482.14093.\n\nSo tan(theta)=5.604 / 2.14093 \u22482.618.\n\nWhich brings us back to the earlier calculation, where theta\u224869 degrees.\n\nSo each photon makes an angle of about 69 degrees above and below the x-axis. The angle between them is 2*69=138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, which produce two photons with equal energy. The photons move in opposite directions relative to the x-axis, and we are tasked with finding the angle between them.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2.\n   - The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:\n     \\[\n     E_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4m_e c^2 + 2m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2.\n     \\]\n   - After annihilation, the two photons share this total energy equally:\n     \\[\n     E_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{2} = 3m_e c^2.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Momentum Conservation**:\n   - The total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Using their Lorentz factors and velocities:\n     \\[\n     \\beta_e = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}, \\quad \\beta_p = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2},\n     \\]\n     the momenta are:\n     \\[\n     p_e = \\gamma_e m_e \\beta_e c = 4m_e \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c = m_e \\sqrt{15} c,\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     p_p = \\gamma_p m_e \\beta_p c = 2m_e \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c = m_e \\sqrt{3} c.\n     \\]\n     Since the positron moves to the left, its momentum is subtracted:\n     \\[\n     P_{\\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n     \\]\n\n3. **Photon Momentum and Angles**:\n   - After annihilation, the two photons have equal energy, so their magnitudes of momentum are equal:\n     \\[\n     |p_1| = |p_2| = \\frac{E_{\\text{photon}}}{c} = \\frac{3m_e c^2}{c} = 3m_e c.\n     \\]\n   - The photons move symmetrically above and below the x-axis. Let their angles with the x-axis be \\(\\theta\\) and \\(-\\theta\\). Their momentum components are:\n     \\[\n     p_1 = (p_{1x}, p_{1y}), \\quad p_2 = (p_{2x}, -p_{2y}),\n     \\]\n     where:\n     \\[\n     p_{1x} = p_{2x}, \\quad p_{1y} = -p_{2y}.\n     \\]\n   - The total momentum after annihilation must equal the total momentum before annihilation:\n     \\[\n     p_{1x} + p_{2x} = P_{\\text{total}}, \\quad p_{1y} + p_{2y} = 0.\n     \\]\n     Since \\(p_{1x} = p_{2x}\\), we find:\n     \\[\n     2p_{1x} = P_{\\text{total}} \\implies p_{1x} = \\frac{P_{\\text{total}}}{2}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Energy and Angle Calculation**:\n   - Using the energy of each photon, the magnitude of momentum is:\n     \\[\n     |p_1| = \\sqrt{p_{1x}^2 + p_{1y}^2} = 3m_e c.\n     \\]\n     Substituting \\(p_{1x} = \\frac{P_{\\text{total}}}{2}\\), we solve for \\(p_{1y}\\):\n     \\[\n     p_{1y} = \\sqrt{(3m_e c)^2 - \\left(\\frac{P_{\\text{total}}}{2}\\right)^2}.\n     \\]\n   - The angle \\(\\theta\\) each photon makes with the x-axis is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{p_{1y}}{p_{1x}}.\n     \\]\n     Substituting the values, \\(\\tan(\\theta) \\approx 2.618\\), which corresponds to \\(\\theta \\approx 69^\\circ\\).\n\n5. **Angle Between Photons**:\n   - The angle between the two photons is \\(2\\theta\\), as one photon is at \\(+\\theta\\) and the other at \\(-\\theta\\). Thus:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Angle between photons} = 2\\theta \\approx 2 \\cdot 69^\\circ = 138^\\circ.\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.\n\nANSWER: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating and producing photons. Hmm, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle meet, they can annihilate into energy, usually photons. But let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe problem says an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma = 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with gamma = 2. So they collide head-on.\n\nAfter they annihilate, they produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy. Interesting. And their directions are one upper-right and the other lower-right. So they're both moving to the right, but one is above the axis and the other is below.\n\nWait, but wait. The electron is moving from the left, so it's moving towards the right. The positron is moving from the right towards the left. Oh no, wait, no. Wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So the electron is moving to the right (from left), positron moving to the left (from right). So they are approaching each other. So when they collide, they annihilate into photons.\n\nSo the setup is that the electron and positron are moving towards each other on the same line. So their momenta are opposite in direction.\n\nBut wait, they have different Lorentz factors. So their energies and momenta are different. So I need to compute their total energy and momentum before the collision to figure out the properties of the photons.\n\nLet me think about the conservation laws. Since the system is isolated, the total energy and momentum before annihilation should equal those after.\n\nSo first, let's figure out the rest masses. The electron and positron have the same mass, which is the electron mass, m. The rest mass energy is mc\u00b2, which I'll just call m for simplicity since we're dealing with units where c=1 maybe.\n\nBut wait, for the Lorentz factors, gamma is given. So gamma_e =4 for the electron, gamma_p=2 for the positron.\n\nSo the energy of each particle is gamma * m c\u00b2. Since positron is moving opposite, I should consider direction.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the electron is moving from left to right, so its velocity is positive. The positron is moving from right to left, so its velocity is negative. So their momenta are opposite.\n\nSo, let's model the electron as moving in the +x direction, and the positron in the -x direction.\n\nBut wait, wait. No, the positron is moving from the right. So if the electron is moving to the right (from left), the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nSo, the momentum of the electron is gamma_e * m * v_e in the +x direction. The momentum of the positron is gamma_p * m * v_p in the -x direction. So the total momentum before collision is (gamma_e v_e - gamma_p v_p) m.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to compute their relativistic momenta.\n\nThe relativistic momentum p is gamma m v. So for each particle:\n\nElectron: p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e\nPositron: p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p\n\nBut their directions are opposite. So the total momentum is p_e (right) minus p_p (left). Wait, no, the positron is moving left, so its momentum is in the negative x direction. So total momentum is p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative, since it's moving left), but wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the positron's velocity is in the negative x direction, so v_p is negative. So p_p is gamma_p * m * v_p. So if v_p is negative, p_p is negative. So the total momentum is p_e (positive) + p_p (negative). So P_total = (gamma_e v_e - gamma_p v_p) m.\n\nWait, but I don't know the velocities yet. Oh wait, but gamma is related to velocity. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So for each particle, we can find their velocities.\n\nLet me compute v_e and v_p.\n\nFor the electron: gamma_e =4. So,\n\ngamma_e = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2) =4\n\nSo, 1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 =1/(gamma_e\u00b2) =1/16.\n\nSo v_e\u00b2 = c\u00b2 (1 -1/16 )= c\u00b2 *15/16 \u2192 v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15))/4 \u2248 0.968 c.\n\nSimilarly for positron: gamma_p=2.\n\ngamma_p=1/sqrt(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2) =2 \u2192 1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2 =1/4 \u2192 v_p\u00b2 = (3/4) c\u00b2 \u2192 v_p= c*sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866 c.\n\nWait, but wait: the positron is moving to the left, so v_p is negative. So v_p = - (sqrt(3)/2) c.\n\nSo now, the momenta:\n\np_e = gamma_e * m * v_e =4 m ( (sqrt(15)/4 ) c ) = m c sqrt(15) * (4/4) )= m c sqrt(15).\n\nWait, let me compute that again. gamma_e is 4, v_e is (sqrt(15)/4 ) c.\n\nSo p_e =4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4 ) c = m c sqrt(15).\n\nSimilarly, p_p is gamma_p * m * v_p =2 * m * ( -sqrt(3)/2 c )= - m c sqrt(3).\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, because p_p is negative. So the total is m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, for the photons: after annihilation, two photons are produced. Their energies are the same, so E1=E2=E.\n\nEach photon has energy E, and since they're moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their momenta are in those directions. Photons carry momentum p = E/c, but since we're using units where c=1, p=E.\n\nWait, but the direction matters. So for photon 1, let's say it's moving at an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 at theta below the x-axis. But wait, the problem states that one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving in the right direction, but one is above the x-axis, the other is below.\n\nWait, but if both are moving to the right, their momenta vectors would be in the right direction, but with some vertical component. Wait, but if both have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum would be same, but directions differ.\n\nWait, but the problem says the energies are same. So E1=E2=E. So their momenta magnitudes are same as well, since p=E (since for photons, E=pc).\n\nSo the two photons have momenta vectors p1 and p2, each with magnitude E, but their directions are such that their sum gives the total momentum of the system.\n\nSo the total momentum after annihilation is p1 + p2.\n\nBut since the system is isolated, the total momentum after must equal the total before, which was m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo, the sum of the two photon momenta must equal this.\n\nLet me model the photons. Let's say photon 1 is at an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 is at theta below, because their directions are symmetric in the x-y plane.\n\nWait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So perhaps their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nWait, but if the total momentum is along the x-axis, then the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out.\n\nBecause the initial total momentum is along the x-axis. So the y-components of the photons' momenta must sum to zero. So if one photon has a +y component and the other has -y, their sum is zero.\n\nSo, for the two photons, their y-components must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Hence, their angles are theta above and theta below the x-axis.\n\nSo, let's model photon 1 as having components (E_x, E_y) and photon 2 as (E_x', -E_y), since their y-components are opposite.\n\nBut wait, since both photons have the same energy E, their momenta magnitudes are the same. So the magnitudes of their x and y components must satisfy E\u00b2 = (E_x)^2 + (E_y)^2 for each.\n\nSo for photon 1, E_x = E cos(theta), E_y = E sin(theta).\n\nPhoton 2: E_x' = E cos(phi), E_y' = E sin(phi).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought their y-components would be opposite. So perhaps for photon 2, phi is -theta? Because the angle is below the x-axis.\n\nSo let's say photon 2 has an angle of -theta. So its components are E cos(theta), -E sin(theta).\n\nSo the sum of the two photons' momenta is:\n\n(E cos(theta) + E cos(theta)) in x-direction \u2192 2 E cos(theta).\n\nAnd for y-direction: E sin(theta) - E sin(theta) = 0. So that's good because the initial total momentum is along x.\n\nSo the total momentum after is (2 E cos(theta), 0), which must equal the initial momentum, which was m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the initial momentum is in the x-direction, but I need to compute the initial momentum correctly.\n\nWait, let me recap. The initial momentum is the sum of the electron and positron momenta. The electron is moving to the right, positron to the left.\n\nWait, no, the positron is moving to the left (since it's moving from the right towards the left). So the positron's momentum is in the negative x direction.\n\nSo the electron's momentum is positive, and the positron's is negative.\n\nSo their momenta are:\n\np_e = gamma_e m v_e =4 m (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= m c sqrt(15).\n\np_p = gamma_p m v_p =2 m (-sqrt(3)/2 c )= - m c sqrt(3).\n\nSo total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo the total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' momenta. The photons have energies E each, moving in directions making angles theta and -theta with the x-axis.\n\nSo their x-components are E cos(theta) and E cos(theta), respectively. So total x-momentum is 2 E cos(theta).\n\nAnd their y-components are E sin(theta) and -E sin(theta), which cancel.\n\nSo the total momentum after is 2 E cos(theta) in the x-direction. This must equal the initial momentum.\n\nSo:\n\n2 E cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nAdditionally, the total energy before must equal the total energy after. So let's compute the total energy before.\n\nThe electron's energy is gamma_e m c\u00b2 =4 m c\u00b2.\n\nThe positron's energy is gamma_p m c\u00b2 =2 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo total energy before is 4 m c\u00b2 + 2 m c\u00b2 =6 m c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the two photons have energies E each, so total energy after is 2 E.\n\nSo 2 E =6 m c\u00b2 \u2192 E=3 m c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait: for a photon, E = pc. So if E=3 m c\u00b2, then p = E/c =3 m c.\n\nBut wait, the units are a bit confusing. Wait, in this context, when we use E=pc, it's because for photons, E=pc (since their mass is zero). So yes, E=pc.\n\nSo each photon has p=E/c. So if E=3 m c\u00b2, then p=3 m c\u00b2 /c =3 m c.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the momentum equation, the total momentum is 2 E cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, substituting E=3 m c\u00b2, and 2 E cos(theta) = 2 *3 m c\u00b2 * cos(theta) =6 m c\u00b2 cos(theta).\n\nBut the initial momentum is m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo:\n\n6 m c\u00b2 cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWe can cancel m c from both sides:\n\n6 c cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos(theta)= [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / (6 c).\n\nWait, but wait, units again. Let me make sure about the units.\n\nWait, the initial momentum is in terms of m c. So the equation 2 E cos(theta) equals that initial momentum.\n\nWait, E is in terms of m c\u00b2, and the initial momentum is in terms of m c. So let's make the units consistent.\n\nWait, 2 E cos(theta) has units of E (energy) times cos(theta) (dimensionless) \u2192 units of energy. But the initial momentum has units of m c (mass \u00d7 velocity), which is energy \u00d7 time, but in natural units (c=1), energy and momentum have the same units.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of m c.\n\nWait, let's try again. The initial momentum is m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nThe total momentum after is 2 E cos(theta) in units where c=1, so E is in units of energy, which equals momentum \u00d7 c. So when c=1, E=p.\n\nWait, so perhaps I should model this with c=1 for simplicity.\n\nSo let me restate:\n\nWith c=1,\n\np_e = gamma_e m v_e =4 m (sqrt(15)/4 ) = m sqrt(15).\n\np_p = gamma_p m v_p =2 m (-sqrt(3)/2 ) = -m sqrt(3).\n\nSo initial total momentum P_initial = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nEnergy before: E_electron = gamma_e m c\u00b2 =4 m.\n\nE_positron = gamma_p m c\u00b2 =2 m.\n\nSo total energy E_initial =6 m.\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons, each with energy E.\n\nSo E_photon1 + E_photon2 =2 E =6 m \u2192 E=3 m.\n\nEach photon has momentum p=E (since E=pc and c=1).\n\nSo their momenta are vectors p1 and p2, each with magnitude 3 m.\n\nThe sum of their momenta must equal the initial momentum P_initial = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo p1 + p2 = P_initial.\n\nEach photon's momentum vector can be written as (3 m cos(theta), 3 m sin(theta)) and (3 m cos(phi), 3 m sin(phi)).\n\nBut since their directions are symmetric, I think phi is -theta, as discussed earlier. So:\n\np1 = (3 m cos(theta), 3 m sin(theta))\n\np2 = (3 m cos(theta), -3 m sin(theta))\n\nSo sum is (6 m cos(theta), 0).\n\nThis must equal (m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), 0).\n\nSo:\n\n6 m cos(theta) = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.\n\nCompute the value:\n\nsqrt(15) \u22483.87298\n\nsqrt(3)\u22481.73205\n\nsqrt(15) - sqrt(3)= approx 3.87298 -1.73205=2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093/6 \u22480.35682.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.35682) \u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, wait, but wait a second. The angle theta is the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. One is at +theta, the other at -theta.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 2 theta.\n\nSo 2 *69 \u2248138 degrees.\n\nHmm, looking at the options, option C is 138.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) more accurately.\n\nsqrt(15) is approximately 3.872983346.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.732050808.\n\nSubtracting: 3.872983346 -1.732050808 = 2.140932538.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.140932538 /6 \u22480.3568220897.\n\nWhat's the arccos of that?\n\nUsing a calculator: cos\u207b\u00b9(0.35682) \u224869 degrees.\n\nSo 2 theta is 138 degrees.\n\nSo the angle between the photons is 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138.\n\nSo the answer should be C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating and producing photons. Hmm, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle meet, they can annihilate into energy, usually photons. But let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe problem says an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma = 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with gamma = 2. So they collide head-on.\n\nAfter they annihilate, they produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy. Interesting. And their directions are one upper-right and the other lower-right. So they're both moving to the right, but one is above the axis and the other is below.\n\nWait, but wait. The electron is moving from the left, so it's moving towards the right. The positron is moving from the right towards the left. Oh no, wait, no. Wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So the electron is moving to the right (from left), positron moving to the left (from right). So they are approaching each other. So when they collide, they annihilate into photons.\n\nSo the setup is that the electron and positron are moving towards each other on the same line. So their momenta are opposite in direction.\n\nBut wait, they have different Lorentz factors. So their energies and momenta are different. So I need to compute their total energy and momentum before the collision to figure out the properties of the photons.\n\nLet me think about the conservation laws. Since the system is isolated, the total energy and momentum before annihilation should equal those after.\n\nSo first, let's figure out the rest masses. The electron and positron have the same mass, which is the electron mass, m. The rest mass energy is mc\u00b2, which I'll just call m for simplicity since we're dealing with units where c=1 maybe.\n\nBut wait, for the Lorentz factors, gamma is given. So gamma_e =4 for the electron, gamma_p=2 for the positron.\n\nSo the energy of each particle is gamma * m c\u00b2. Since positron is moving opposite, I should consider direction.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the electron is moving from left to right, so its velocity is positive. The positron is moving from right to left, so its velocity is negative. So their momenta are opposite.\n\nSo, let's model the electron as moving in the +x direction, and the positron in the -x direction.\n\nBut wait, wait. No, the positron is moving from the right. So if the electron is moving to the right (from left), the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nSo, the momentum of the electron is gamma_e * m * v_e in the +x direction. The momentum of the positron is gamma_p * m * v_p in the -x direction. So the total momentum before collision is (gamma_e v_e - gamma_p v_p) m.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to compute their relativistic momenta.\n\nThe relativistic momentum p is gamma m v. So for each particle:\n\nElectron: p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e\nPositron: p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p\n\nBut their directions are opposite. So the total momentum is p_e (right) minus p_p (left). Wait, no, the positron is moving left, so its momentum is in the negative x direction. So total momentum is p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative, since it's moving left), but wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the positron's velocity is in the negative x direction, so v_p is negative. So p_p is gamma_p * m * v_p. So if v_p is negative, p_p is negative. So the total momentum is p_e (positive) + p_p (negative). So P_total = (gamma_e v_e - gamma_p v_p) m.\n\nWait, but I don't know the velocities yet. Oh wait, but gamma is related to velocity. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So for each particle, we can find their velocities.\n\nLet me compute v_e and v_p.\n\nFor the electron: gamma_e =4. So,\n\ngamma_e = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2) =4\n\nSo, 1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 =1/(gamma_e\u00b2) =1/16.\n\nSo v_e\u00b2 = c\u00b2 (1 -1/16 )= c\u00b2 *15/16 \u2192 v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15))/4 \u2248 0.968 c.\n\nSimilarly for positron: gamma_p=2.\n\ngamma_p=1/sqrt(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2) =2 \u2192 1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2 =1/4 \u2192 v_p\u00b2 = (3/4) c\u00b2 \u2192 v_p= c*sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866 c.\n\nWait, but wait: the positron is moving to the left, so v_p is negative. So v_p = - (sqrt(3)/2) c.\n\nSo now, the momenta:\n\np_e = gamma_e * m * v_e =4 m ( (sqrt(15)/4 ) c ) = m c sqrt(15) * (4/4) )= m c sqrt(15).\n\nWait, let me compute that again. gamma_e is 4, v_e is (sqrt(15)/4 ) c.\n\nSo p_e =4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4 ) c = m c sqrt(15).\n\nSimilarly, p_p is gamma_p * m * v_p =2 * m * ( -sqrt(3)/2 c )= - m c sqrt(3).\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, because p_p is negative. So the total is m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, for the photons: after annihilation, two photons are produced. Their energies are the same, so E1=E2=E.\n\nEach photon has energy E, and since they're moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their momenta are in those directions. Photons carry momentum p = E/c, but since we're using units where c=1, p=E.\n\nWait, but the direction matters. So for photon 1, let's say it's moving at an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 at theta below the x-axis. But wait, the problem states that one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving in the right direction, but one is above the x-axis, the other is below.\n\nWait, but if both are moving to the right, their momenta vectors would be in the right direction, but with some vertical component. Wait, but if both have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum would be same, but directions differ.\n\nWait, but the problem says the energies are same. So E1=E2=E. So their momenta magnitudes are same as well, since p=E (since for photons, E=pc).\n\nSo the two photons have momenta vectors p1 and p2, each with magnitude E, but their directions are such that their sum gives the total momentum of the system.\n\nSo the total momentum after annihilation is p1 + p2.\n\nBut since the system is isolated, the total momentum after must equal the total before, which was m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo, the sum of the two photon momenta must equal this.\n\nLet me model the photons. Let's say photon 1 is at an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 is at theta below, because their directions are symmetric in the x-y plane.\n\nWait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So perhaps their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nWait, but if the total momentum is along the x-axis, then the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out.\n\nBecause the initial total momentum is along the x-axis. So the y-components of the photons' momenta must sum to zero. So if one photon has a +y component and the other has -y, their sum is zero.\n\nSo, for the two photons, their y-components must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Hence, their angles are theta above and theta below the x-axis.\n\nSo, let's model photon 1 as having components (E_x, E_y) and photon 2 as (E_x', -E_y), since their y-components are opposite.\n\nBut wait, since both photons have the same energy E, their momenta magnitudes are the same. So the magnitudes of their x and y components must satisfy E\u00b2 = (E_x)^2 + (E_y)^2 for each.\n\nSo for photon 1, E_x = E cos(theta), E_y = E sin(theta).\n\nPhoton 2: E_x' = E cos(phi), E_y' = E sin(phi).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought their y-components would be opposite. So perhaps for photon 2, phi is -theta? Because the angle is below the x-axis.\n\nSo let's say photon 2 has an angle of -theta. So its components are E cos(theta), -E sin(theta).\n\nSo the sum of the two photons' momenta is:\n\n(E cos(theta) + E cos(theta)) in x-direction \u2192 2 E cos(theta).\n\nAnd for y-direction: E sin(theta) - E sin(theta) = 0. So that's good because the initial total momentum is along x.\n\nSo the total momentum after is (2 E cos(theta), 0), which must equal the initial momentum, which was m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the initial momentum is in the x-direction, but I need to compute the initial momentum correctly.\n\nWait, let me recap. The initial momentum is the sum of the electron and positron momenta. The electron is moving to the right, positron to the left.\n\nWait, no, the positron is moving to the left (since it's moving from the right towards the left). So the positron's momentum is in the negative x direction.\n\nSo the electron's momentum is positive, and the positron's is negative.\n\nSo their momenta are:\n\np_e = gamma_e m v_e =4 m (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= m c sqrt(15).\n\np_p = gamma_p m v_p =2 m (-sqrt(3)/2 c )= - m c sqrt(3).\n\nSo total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo the total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' momenta. The photons have energies E each, moving in directions making angles theta and -theta with the x-axis.\n\nSo their x-components are E cos(theta) and E cos(theta), respectively. So total x-momentum is 2 E cos(theta).\n\nAnd their y-components are E sin(theta) and -E sin(theta), which cancel.\n\nSo the total momentum after is 2 E cos(theta) in the x-direction. This must equal the initial momentum.\n\nSo:\n\n2 E cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nAdditionally, the total energy before must equal the total energy after. So let's compute the total energy before.\n\nThe electron's energy is gamma_e m c\u00b2 =4 m c\u00b2.\n\nThe positron's energy is gamma_p m c\u00b2 =2 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo total energy before is 4 m c\u00b2 + 2 m c\u00b2 =6 m c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the two photons have energies E each, so total energy after is 2 E.\n\nSo 2 E =6 m c\u00b2 \u2192 E=3 m c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait: for a photon, E = pc. So if E=3 m c\u00b2, then p = E/c =3 m c.\n\nBut wait, the units are a bit confusing. Wait, in this context, when we use E=pc, it's because for photons, E=pc (since their mass is zero). So yes, E=pc.\n\nSo each photon has p=E/c. So if E=3 m c\u00b2, then p=3 m c\u00b2 /c =3 m c.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the momentum equation, the total momentum is 2 E cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, substituting E=3 m c\u00b2, and 2 E cos(theta) = 2 *3 m c\u00b2 * cos(theta) =6 m c\u00b2 cos(theta).\n\nBut the initial momentum is m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo:\n\n6 m c\u00b2 cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWe can cancel m c from both sides:\n\n6 c cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos(theta)= [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / (6 c).\n\nWait, but wait, units again. Let me make sure about the units.\n\nWait, the initial momentum is in terms of m c. So the equation 2 E cos(theta) equals that initial momentum.\n\nWait, E is in terms of m c\u00b2, and the initial momentum is in terms of m c. So let's make the units consistent.\n\nWait, 2 E cos(theta) has units of E (energy) times cos(theta) (dimensionless) \u2192 units of energy. But the initial momentum has units of m c (mass \u00d7 velocity), which is energy \u00d7 time, but in natural units (c=1), energy and momentum have the same units.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of m c.\n\nWait, let's try again. The initial momentum is m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nThe total momentum after is 2 E cos(theta) in units where c=1, so E is in units of energy, which equals momentum \u00d7 c. So when c=1, E=p.\n\nWait, so perhaps I should model this with c=1 for simplicity.\n\nSo let me restate:\n\nWith c=1,\n\np_e = gamma_e m v_e =4 m (sqrt(15)/4 ) = m sqrt(15).\n\np_p = gamma_p m v_p =2 m (-sqrt(3)/2 ) = -m sqrt(3).\n\nSo initial total momentum P_initial = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nEnergy before: E_electron = gamma_e m c\u00b2 =4 m.\n\nE_positron = gamma_p m c\u00b2 =2 m.\n\nSo total energy E_initial =6 m.\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons, each with energy E.\n\nSo E_photon1 + E_photon2 =2 E =6 m \u2192 E=3 m.\n\nEach photon has momentum p=E (since E=pc and c=1).\n\nSo their momenta are vectors p1 and p2, each with magnitude 3 m.\n\nThe sum of their momenta must equal the initial momentum P_initial = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo p1 + p2 = P_initial.\n\nEach photon's momentum vector can be written as (3 m cos(theta), 3 m sin(theta)) and (3 m cos(phi), 3 m sin(phi)).\n\nBut since their directions are symmetric, I think phi is -theta, as discussed earlier. So:\n\np1 = (3 m cos(theta), 3 m sin(theta))\n\np2 = (3 m cos(theta), -3 m sin(theta))\n\nSo sum is (6 m cos(theta), 0).\n\nThis must equal (m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), 0).\n\nSo:\n\n6 m cos(theta) = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.\n\nCompute the value:\n\nsqrt(15) \u22483.87298\n\nsqrt(3)\u22481.73205\n\nsqrt(15) - sqrt(3)= approx 3.87298 -1.73205=2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093/6 \u22480.35682.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.35682) \u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, wait, but wait a second. The angle theta is the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. One is at +theta, the other at -theta.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 2 theta.\n\nSo 2 *69 \u2248138 degrees.\n\nHmm, looking at the options, option C is 138.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) more accurately.\n\nsqrt(15) is approximately 3.872983346.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.732050808.\n\nSubtracting: 3.872983346 -1.732050808 = 2.140932538.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.140932538 /6 \u22480.3568220897.\n\nWhat's the arccos of that?\n\nUsing a calculator: cos\u207b\u00b9(0.35682) \u224869 degrees.\n\nSo 2 theta is 138 degrees.\n\nSo the angle between the photons is 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138.\n\nSo the answer should be C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis, with the electron moving to the right (from the left) and the positron moving to the left (from the right). Their Lorentz factors are given as 4 and 2, respectively. After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies, moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Energy and Momentum\nThe total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{initial}} = \\gamma_e m c^2 + \\gamma_p m c^2 = 4m c^2 + 2m c^2 = 6m c^2.\n\\]\n\nThe total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the relativistic momenta of the electron and positron. Using the relativistic momentum formula \\(p = \\gamma m v\\), we calculate:\n\\[\np_e = \\gamma_e m v_e = 4m \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}c = m c \\sqrt{15},\n\\]\n\\[\np_p = \\gamma_p m v_p = 2m \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)c = -m c \\sqrt{3}.\n\\]\nThus, the total momentum is:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{initial}} = p_e + p_p = m c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Energy and Momentum After Annihilation\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies \\(E\\). Since the total energy is conserved:\n\\[\n2E = 6m c^2 \\implies E = 3m c^2.\n\\]\n\nEach photon has momentum \\(p = E/c = 3m c\\). The photons move in directions symmetric about the x-axis, making angles \\(\\theta\\) and \\(-\\theta\\) with the x-axis. Their momentum components are:\n\\[\np_1 = (3m c \\cos\\theta, 3m c \\sin\\theta), \\quad p_2 = (3m c \\cos\\theta, -3m c \\sin\\theta).\n\\]\nThe total momentum after annihilation is:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{final}} = p_1 + p_2 = (6m c \\cos\\theta, 0).\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Conservation of Momentum\nEquating the total momentum before and after annihilation:\n\\[\n6m c \\cos\\theta = m c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n\\]\nCanceling \\(m c\\) from both sides:\n\\[\n6 \\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.87298\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73205\\):\n\\[\n6 \\cos\\theta \\approx 3.87298 - 1.73205 = 2.14093 \\implies \\cos\\theta \\approx 0.35682.\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n\\theta \\approx \\arccos(0.35682) \\approx 69^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons\nThe angle between the two photons is \\(2\\theta\\):\n\\[\n2\\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69^\\circ = 138^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.\n\nAn electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate, producing two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.\n\nHmm. So, let's break this down. First, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since the electron and positron are matter and antimatter, their annihilation should result in energy in the form of photons. And since the total energy and momentum must be conserved, I can use those principles here.\n\nWait, but the problem says both photons have the same energy. That's interesting. So each photon has the same energy, E. Since energy is conserved, the total energy of the system before annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the initial setup. The electron is moving to the right (from the left) with Lorentz factor gamma1 =4. The positron is moving to the left (from the right) with gamma2=2. So their velocities are in opposite directions along the same axis.\n\nI think I need to calculate the total energy and momentum before annihilation. Then, when they annihilate into two photons, the total energy and momentum of the photons must match those.\n\nSo, first, let's find the rest mass energy of the electron and positron. Since they're matter and antimatter, each has the same rest mass as an electron, which is about 0.511 MeV. But wait, in the problem, maybe it's better to work with units where c=1 for simplicity.\n\nBut wait, the Lorentz factor gamma is given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. So the total energy of each particle would be gamma times the rest mass energy.\n\nSo, the electron's energy is gamma1 * m_e c\u00b2. Similarly, the positron's energy is gamma2 * m_e c\u00b2. Since gamma1 is 4 and gamma2 is 2, their energies are 4m and 2m, respectively, where m is m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The positron has the same mass as the electron, right? So yes, same m_e.\n\nNow, momentum. For each particle, the momentum is gamma * m_e v. But since v = c * beta, and beta is v/c. Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2), I can express beta in terms of gamma.\n\nAlternatively, the momentum p can be expressed as gamma m_e beta. But another way is to note that p = gamma m_e v. And since v = c * beta, so p = gamma m_e beta c.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to express p in terms of gamma and m_e c\u00b2. Let me think: the energy E = gamma m_e c\u00b2, and the momentum p = gamma m_e beta c. But beta can be written in terms of gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2)). So p = gamma m_e c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) = (gamma m_e c) * sqrt( (gamma\u00b2 -1)/gamma\u00b2 ) ) = m_e c sqrt(gamma\u00b2 -1).\n\nOh, right! So for each particle, the momentum magnitude is sqrt( gamma\u00b2 - 1 ) * m_e c.\n\nSo for the electron (gamma1=4), p_e = sqrt(16-1) m_e c = sqrt(15) m_e c. And for the positron (gamma2=2), p_p = sqrt(4-1) m_e c = sqrt(3) m_e c.\n\nBut wait, direction matters. The electron is moving to the right, so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the total initial momentum is p_e (right) minus p_p (left), because positron's momentum is to the left.\n\nWait, no, wait. The positron is moving from the right, so its direction is to the left along the axis. So the momentum of the positron is negative.\n\nSo, initial total momentum P_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left). Wait, but wait: p_p is the magnitude, but direction is left, so in terms of sign, it's negative.\n\nSo P_initial = (sqrt(15) m_e c) - (sqrt(3) m_e c) ) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the positron is moving left, so its momentum is in the negative x-direction. So the total initial momentum is p_e (positive x) plus p_p (negative x) which is p_e - p_p.\n\nSo P_initial = sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c.\n\nWait, but let me compute that numerically. sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So 3.872 - 1.732 is about 2.14. So the total initial momentum is positive, meaning it's directed to the right.\n\nNow, the total energy E_initial is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies. So E_initial = 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the total energy E_photon1 + E_photon2 = E_initial. But the problem says both photons have the same energy, E. So 2E = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait. Each photon's energy is 3 m_e c\u00b2. Hmm. Because 6 m_e c\u00b2 /2 =3.\n\nSo each photon has energy E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nNow, the photons are moving in opposite directions in terms of the problem description: one upper-right, the other lower-right. So their directions are symmetric about the x-axis, perhaps. So their angles from the x-axis are symmetric, say \u03b8 and -\u03b8, but considering their direction of motion.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Both photons are moving to the right, but one is going up-right (like NE), the other down-right (SE). So their angles relative to the x-axis (right direction) are \u03b8 and -\u03b8, but since both are to the right, their x-components are positive, but y-components have opposite signs.\n\nWait, but the problem says the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So each photon is moving to the right, but one upwards, the other downwards. So their angles relative to the x-axis are +\u03b8 and -\u03b8, where \u03b8 is measured from the x-axis.\n\nNow, since photons carry momentum and energy, and the total momentum must be conserved, I can set up equations for momentum in x and y directions.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Photon 1 is moving at an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 at angle -\u03b8 below the x-axis.\n\nEach photon's momentum magnitude is E/c, since for a photon, E = pc. Because for a photon, E = pc \u2192 p = E/c.\n\nSo for photon 1, the momentum components are p1x = (E/c) cos\u03b8, p1y = (E/c) sin\u03b8.\n\nFor photon 2, p2x = (E/c) cos(-\u03b8) = (E/c) cos\u03b8, since cosine is even. p2y = (E/c) sin(-\u03b8) = -(E/c) sin\u03b8.\n\nSo the total momentum in the x-direction after annihilation is p1x + p2x = 2*(E/c) cos\u03b8.\n\nIn the y-direction, p1y + p2y = (E/c sin\u03b8) - (E/c sin\u03b8) ) = 0.\n\nWait, but the initial momentum in the y-direction is zero. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the total momentum after annihilation in the x-direction must equal the initial momentum P_initial.\n\nSo,\n\nTotal momentum after: (2 E/c) cos\u03b8 = P_initial.\n\nBut P_initial is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nWait, but let me write this in terms of E. Since E = 3 m_e c\u00b2, and E/c = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n2*(3 m_e c) * cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m_e c cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nWe can cancel m_e c from both sides:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.\n\nLet me compute the numerical value of (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nsqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298\nsqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205\nSo difference \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nWhat angle has a cosine of about 0.3568? Let's calculate.\n\nUsing a calculator, cos\u207b\u00b9(0.3568) \u2248 69 degrees? Wait, wait, no. Wait, cos(60\u00b0) is 0.5, cos(70\u00b0) is about 0.3420. Hmm, 0.3568 is between 69 and 70 degrees.\n\nWait, cos(69\u00b0) is approximately 0.3584, which is very close to 0.3568. So \u03b8 is approximately 69 degrees.\n\nWait, but wait, let's compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute cos(69\u00b0): Using calculator, cos(69) \u2248 0.3584.\n\nBut our value is 0.3568, which is slightly less than that, so the angle is a bit more than 69 degrees. Let's see:\n\ncos(69.1) \u2248 ?\n\nWell, cos decreases as angle increases. So 0.3568 is less than 0.3584, so angle is slightly larger than 69 degrees, maybe 69.1 degrees.\n\nBut perhaps the exact value is better handled symbolically.\n\nWait, but perhaps the exact value can be found. Let me see:\n\nWe have cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.\n\nLet me rationalize or see if this expression can be simplified.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) squared.\n\nWait, (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 15 +3 - 2*sqrt(45) = 18 - 2*3*sqrt(5) = 18 -6 sqrt(5).\n\nBut perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find sin\u03b8 from the same equation.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to proceed numerically.\n\nSo, \u03b8 \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, but wait. The question asks for the angle between the two photons. Each photon is moving at \u03b8 and -\u03b8 from the x-axis. So the angle between them is 2\u03b8.\n\nSo 2\u03b8 \u2248 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the initial setup. Did I get the directions correct?\n\nThe electron is moving from left to right, the positron from right to left. So their momenta are in opposite directions. Wait, but in the problem, the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left.\n\nSo the initial momentum is p_e (right) + p_p (left) \u2192 p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, but wait: when the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. So the initial momentum is (p_e - p_p) in the right direction.\n\nBut wait, I computed P_initial as (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nWhich is approximately 3.872 - 1.732 \u2248 2.140 m_e c, which is positive, so direction is to the right.\n\nSo when the photons are emitted, their total momentum in the x-direction must equal this P_initial.\n\nSo in the x-direction, the two photons have momenta adding to 2.140 m_e c.\n\nBut each photon's x-component is (E/c) cos\u03b8. Since E =3 m_e c\u00b2, E/c =3 m_e c.\n\nSo each photon's x-component is 3 m_e c cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the sum is 2 *3 m_e c cos\u03b8 =6 m_e c cos\u03b8.\n\nSet equal to 2.140 m_e c:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 =2.140 \u2192 cos\u03b8=2.140/6\u22480.3567.\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nSo \u03b8\u224869 degrees, so the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8\u2248138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138, so that's the answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, conserving energy and momentum. The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2. After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies and symmetric directions relative to the x-axis: one moving upper-right and the other lower-right.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Energy and Momentum\nThe rest energy of an electron (or positron) is \\( m_e c^2 \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.\n\nAn electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate, producing two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.\n\nHmm. So, let's break this down. First, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since the electron and positron are matter and antimatter, their annihilation should result in energy in the form of photons. And since the total energy and momentum must be conserved, I can use those principles here.\n\nWait, but the problem says both photons have the same energy. That's interesting. So each photon has the same energy, E. Since energy is conserved, the total energy of the system before annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the initial setup. The electron is moving to the right (from the left) with Lorentz factor gamma1 =4. The positron is moving to the left (from the right) with gamma2=2. So their velocities are in opposite directions along the same axis.\n\nI think I need to calculate the total energy and momentum before annihilation. Then, when they annihilate into two photons, the total energy and momentum of the photons must match those.\n\nSo, first, let's find the rest mass energy of the electron and positron. Since they're matter and antimatter, each has the same rest mass as an electron, which is about 0.511 MeV. But wait, in the problem, maybe it's better to work with units where c=1 for simplicity.\n\nBut wait, the Lorentz factor gamma is given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. So the total energy of each particle would be gamma times the rest mass energy.\n\nSo, the electron's energy is gamma1 * m_e c\u00b2. Similarly, the positron's energy is gamma2 * m_e c\u00b2. Since gamma1 is 4 and gamma2 is 2, their energies are 4m and 2m, respectively, where m is m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The positron has the same mass as the electron, right? So yes, same m_e.\n\nNow, momentum. For each particle, the momentum is gamma * m_e v. But since v = c * beta, and beta is v/c. Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2), I can express beta in terms of gamma.\n\nAlternatively, the momentum p can be expressed as gamma m_e beta. But another way is to note that p = gamma m_e v. And since v = c * beta, so p = gamma m_e beta c.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to express p in terms of gamma and m_e c\u00b2. Let me think: the energy E = gamma m_e c\u00b2, and the momentum p = gamma m_e beta c. But beta can be written in terms of gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2)). So p = gamma m_e c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) = (gamma m_e c) * sqrt( (gamma\u00b2 -1)/gamma\u00b2 ) ) = m_e c sqrt(gamma\u00b2 -1).\n\nOh, right! So for each particle, the momentum magnitude is sqrt( gamma\u00b2 - 1 ) * m_e c.\n\nSo for the electron (gamma1=4), p_e = sqrt(16-1) m_e c = sqrt(15) m_e c. And for the positron (gamma2=2), p_p = sqrt(4-1) m_e c = sqrt(3) m_e c.\n\nBut wait, direction matters. The electron is moving to the right, so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the total initial momentum is p_e (right) minus p_p (left), because positron's momentum is to the left.\n\nWait, no, wait. The positron is moving from the right, so its direction is to the left along the axis. So the momentum of the positron is negative.\n\nSo, initial total momentum P_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left). Wait, but wait: p_p is the magnitude, but direction is left, so in terms of sign, it's negative.\n\nSo P_initial = (sqrt(15) m_e c) - (sqrt(3) m_e c) ) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the positron is moving left, so its momentum is in the negative x-direction. So the total initial momentum is p_e (positive x) plus p_p (negative x) which is p_e - p_p.\n\nSo P_initial = sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c.\n\nWait, but let me compute that numerically. sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So 3.872 - 1.732 is about 2.14. So the total initial momentum is positive, meaning it's directed to the right.\n\nNow, the total energy E_initial is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies. So E_initial = 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the total energy E_photon1 + E_photon2 = E_initial. But the problem says both photons have the same energy, E. So 2E = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait. Each photon's energy is 3 m_e c\u00b2. Hmm. Because 6 m_e c\u00b2 /2 =3.\n\nSo each photon has energy E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nNow, the photons are moving in opposite directions in terms of the problem description: one upper-right, the other lower-right. So their directions are symmetric about the x-axis, perhaps. So their angles from the x-axis are symmetric, say \u03b8 and -\u03b8, but considering their direction of motion.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Both photons are moving to the right, but one is going up-right (like NE), the other down-right (SE). So their angles relative to the x-axis (right direction) are \u03b8 and -\u03b8, but since both are to the right, their x-components are positive, but y-components have opposite signs.\n\nWait, but the problem says the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So each photon is moving to the right, but one upwards, the other downwards. So their angles relative to the x-axis are +\u03b8 and -\u03b8, where \u03b8 is measured from the x-axis.\n\nNow, since photons carry momentum and energy, and the total momentum must be conserved, I can set up equations for momentum in x and y directions.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Photon 1 is moving at an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 at angle -\u03b8 below the x-axis.\n\nEach photon's momentum magnitude is E/c, since for a photon, E = pc. Because for a photon, E = pc \u2192 p = E/c.\n\nSo for photon 1, the momentum components are p1x = (E/c) cos\u03b8, p1y = (E/c) sin\u03b8.\n\nFor photon 2, p2x = (E/c) cos(-\u03b8) = (E/c) cos\u03b8, since cosine is even. p2y = (E/c) sin(-\u03b8) = -(E/c) sin\u03b8.\n\nSo the total momentum in the x-direction after annihilation is p1x + p2x = 2*(E/c) cos\u03b8.\n\nIn the y-direction, p1y + p2y = (E/c sin\u03b8) - (E/c sin\u03b8) ) = 0.\n\nWait, but the initial momentum in the y-direction is zero. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the total momentum after annihilation in the x-direction must equal the initial momentum P_initial.\n\nSo,\n\nTotal momentum after: (2 E/c) cos\u03b8 = P_initial.\n\nBut P_initial is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nWait, but let me write this in terms of E. Since E = 3 m_e c\u00b2, and E/c = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n2*(3 m_e c) * cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m_e c cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nWe can cancel m_e c from both sides:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.\n\nLet me compute the numerical value of (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nsqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298\nsqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205\nSo difference \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nWhat angle has a cosine of about 0.3568? Let's calculate.\n\nUsing a calculator, cos\u207b\u00b9(0.3568) \u2248 69 degrees? Wait, wait, no. Wait, cos(60\u00b0) is 0.5, cos(70\u00b0) is about 0.3420. Hmm, 0.3568 is between 69 and 70 degrees.\n\nWait, cos(69\u00b0) is approximately 0.3584, which is very close to 0.3568. So \u03b8 is approximately 69 degrees.\n\nWait, but wait, let's compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute cos(69\u00b0): Using calculator, cos(69) \u2248 0.3584.\n\nBut our value is 0.3568, which is slightly less than that, so the angle is a bit more than 69 degrees. Let's see:\n\ncos(69.1) \u2248 ?\n\nWell, cos decreases as angle increases. So 0.3568 is less than 0.3584, so angle is slightly larger than 69 degrees, maybe 69.1 degrees.\n\nBut perhaps the exact value is better handled symbolically.\n\nWait, but perhaps the exact value can be found. Let me see:\n\nWe have cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.\n\nLet me rationalize or see if this expression can be simplified.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) squared.\n\nWait, (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 15 +3 - 2*sqrt(45) = 18 - 2*3*sqrt(5) = 18 -6 sqrt(5).\n\nBut perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find sin\u03b8 from the same equation.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to proceed numerically.\n\nSo, \u03b8 \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, but wait. The question asks for the angle between the two photons. Each photon is moving at \u03b8 and -\u03b8 from the x-axis. So the angle between them is 2\u03b8.\n\nSo 2\u03b8 \u2248 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the initial setup. Did I get the directions correct?\n\nThe electron is moving from left to right, the positron from right to left. So their momenta are in opposite directions. Wait, but in the problem, the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left.\n\nSo the initial momentum is p_e (right) + p_p (left) \u2192 p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, but wait: when the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. So the initial momentum is (p_e - p_p) in the right direction.\n\nBut wait, I computed P_initial as (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nWhich is approximately 3.872 - 1.732 \u2248 2.140 m_e c, which is positive, so direction is to the right.\n\nSo when the photons are emitted, their total momentum in the x-direction must equal this P_initial.\n\nSo in the x-direction, the two photons have momenta adding to 2.140 m_e c.\n\nBut each photon's x-component is (E/c) cos\u03b8. Since E =3 m_e c\u00b2, E/c =3 m_e c.\n\nSo each photon's x-component is 3 m_e c cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the sum is 2 *3 m_e c cos\u03b8 =6 m_e c cos\u03b8.\n\nSet equal to 2.140 m_e c:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 =2.140 \u2192 cos\u03b8=2.140/6\u22480.3567.\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nSo \u03b8\u224869 degrees, so the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8\u2248138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138, so that's the answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, conserving energy and momentum. The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2. After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies and symmetric directions relative to the x-axis: one moving upper-right and the other lower-right.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Energy and Momentum\nThe rest energy of an electron (or positron) is \\( m_e c^2 \\). The total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{initial}} = \\gamma_1 m_e c^2 + \\gamma_2 m_e c^2 = 4m_e c^2 + 2m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2.\n\\]\nThe total momentum before annihilation is the difference between the momenta of the electron and positron. The momentum of a particle is given by \\( p = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} m_e c \\). For the electron (\\( \\gamma_1 = 4 \\)) and positron (\\( \\gamma_2 = 2 \\)):\n\\[\np_{\\text{electron}} = \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} m_e c = \\sqrt{15} m_e c, \\quad p_{\\text{positron}} = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} m_e c = \\sqrt{3} m_e c.\n\\]\nSince the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative. Thus, the total initial momentum is:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{initial}} = p_{\\text{electron}} - p_{\\text{positron}} = \\sqrt{15} m_e c - \\sqrt{3} m_e c.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Energy and Momentum After Annihilation\nAfter annihilation, the system produces two photons with equal energies \\( E \\). Since energy is conserved:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{initial}} = 2E \\implies 6m_e c^2 = 2E \\implies E = 3m_e c^2.\n\\]\nThe total momentum after annihilation must also equal the initial momentum. Each photon has momentum \\( p = \\frac{E}{c} \\), and their directions are symmetric about the x-axis, with angles \\( \\theta \\) and \\( -\\theta \\) relative to the x-axis. The momentum components of the photons are:\n\\[\np_{1x} = p_{2x} = \\frac{E}{c} \\cos\\theta, \\quad p_{1y} = \\frac{E}{c} \\sin\\theta, \\quad p_{2y} = -\\frac{E}{c} \\sin\\theta.\n\\]\nThe total momentum in the y-direction is zero because \\( p_{1y} + p_{2y} = 0 \\). In the x-direction, the total momentum is:\n\\[\np_{\\text{total, x}} = p_{1x} + p_{2x} = 2\\frac{E}{c} \\cos\\theta.\n\\]\nEquating this to the initial momentum:\n\\[\n2\\frac{E}{c} \\cos\\theta = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( \\theta \\)\nSubstitute \\( E = 3m_e c^2 \\) and \\( \\frac{E}{c} = 3m_e c \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n2(3m_e c) \\cos\\theta = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c.\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n6m_e c \\cos\\theta = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c.\n\\]\nCancel \\( m_e c \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n6 \\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}.\n\\]\nCompute \\( \\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.872 \\) and \\( \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732 \\):\n\\[\n6 \\cos\\theta = 3.872 - 1.732 = 2.140.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{2.140}{6} \\approx 0.3567.\n\\]\nFind \\( \\theta \\) using the inverse cosine:\n\\[\n\\theta \\approx \\cos^{-1}(0.3567) \\approx 69^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons\nThe two photons are symmetrically emitted at angles \\( \\theta \\) and \\( -\\theta \\) relative to the x-axis. The angle between them is:\n\\[\n\\Delta\\theta = 2\\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69^\\circ = 138^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.\n\nAnswer: C",
