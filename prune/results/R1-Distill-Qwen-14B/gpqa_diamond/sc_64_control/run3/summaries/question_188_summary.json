      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the crystal lattice parameters. But wait, rhombohedral is a type of crystal structure, right? So I should think about the properties of rhombohedral crystals.\n\nRhombohedral means all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. Oh wait, in this question, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral (or trigonal) crystal system. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance\u2014that's the distance between atoms along the edges of the unit cell. So a, b, c are all equal to 10 Angstrom each because it's rhombohedral.\n\nThe question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos beta) + 2(hl cos gamma) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) ) Wait, but wait, no, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I remember that for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a^2 (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + ... ) Hmm, no, perhaps a better approach is to recall the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters.\n\nWait, the formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = [ (a\u00b2 (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + ... ) ] No, I'm not getting it right. Let me think again. Oh right, I think the general formula is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) - 2(hk cos beta)/(a\u00b2) - 2(hl cos gamma)/(a\u00b2) - 2(kl cos alpha)/(a\u00b2)\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's:\n\nd\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + b\u00b2 ( ... )) No, that's for orthorhombic or something else. Wait, for a general crystal, it's more complex. Alternatively, for a rhombohedral system where a = b = c = a0, and all angles are equal, say theta, then the formula might simplify.\n\nI think the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a0) / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWait, because in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell has a = b = c and all angles equal. So the Miller indices are h, k, l, and the formula for d is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWait, but wait, no\u2014because the angles between the axes are all equal to theta, but when calculating the interplanar distance, we might have to consider the cosines of the angles between the vectors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the formula can be written as:\n\nd\u00b2 = (a\u00b2) / ( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nSince in this case, all angles are 30 degrees.\n\nWait, but the general formula for the interplanar distance in any crystal system is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) + (some terms involving cosines of the angles between the axes)\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the case when the crystal is cubic. In that case, all angles are 90 degrees, so the cos terms would be zero. Then d_{hkl} = a / sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2). That makes sense.\n\nIn this problem, since it's rhombohedral, all the angles are 30 degrees. So the formula must include the cos(30) terms. So I think the formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut wait, I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, I might have to use the formula from the general case, which is:\n\nd_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) (1/a\u00b2) + ... )\n\nWait, maybe I should look up the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. But since I can't do that right now, I'll try to derive it.\n\nIn a rhombohedral system, the lattice is defined by a, b, c all equal to a0, and angles alpha, beta, gamma all equal to theta. The reciprocal lattice vectors are needed for the interplanar distance. Alternatively, the structure factor or the diffraction condition relates to the interplanar distances.\n\nThe formula for interplanar distance is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) + ... )\n\nBut in the case of a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and the angles are all theta. So the formula simplifies.\n\nWait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) + 2(hk cos gamma)/(a\u00b2) + 2(hl cos beta)/(a\u00b2) + 2(kl cos alpha)/(a\u00b2)\n\nWait, but in a rhombohedral system, alpha = beta = gamma = theta. So all the cos terms are cos(theta).\n\nSo substituting, 1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2hk cos theta + 2hl cos theta + 2kl cos theta ) / a\u00b2\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = [ (h + k + l)^2 - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2hk cos theta + 2hl cos theta + 2kl cos theta ] / a\u00b2\n\nWait, that might not help. Alternatively, factor it:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2hk cos theta + 2hl cos theta + 2kl cos theta ] / a\u00b2\n\nWait, perhaps we can factor it as:\n\n= [ (h + k + l)^2 - 2(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) + 2hk(1 + cos theta) + ... ] No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as (h + k + l)^2 + ... but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me take the (111) plane. So h=1, k=1, l=1.\n\nSo substituting h=1, k=1, l=1, the numerator becomes:\n\n1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2*(1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30)\n\nWhich is 3 + 2*(3 * cos30)\n\nWait, cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660.\n\nSo compute this:\n\n3 + 2*(3*(\u221a3/2)) \u2192 3 + 3\u221a3.\n\nSo 3 + 3*1.732 \u2248 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.\n\nSo 1/d\u00b2 = 8.196 / a\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, a is 10 Angstrom. So a\u00b2 is 100.\n\nSo 1/d\u00b2 = 8.196 / 100 \u2192 0.08196.\n\nThus, d\u00b2 = 1 / 0.08196 \u2248 12.201.\n\nSo d = sqrt(12.201) \u2248 3.49 Angstrom. Wait, but that can't be right because the options are around 9-10 Angstrom. Hmm, I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, no, wait a second. I think I made a mistake in the formula. Because the formula I used earlier, 1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + ... ) / a\u00b2, but I think I forgot that in the general case, the denominator is not a\u00b2, but a\u00b2 multiplied by some factors based on the angles.\n\nWait, I think I got the formula wrong. Let me correct this.\n\nThe correct formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal system is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) + 2(hk cos gamma)/(a\u00b2) + 2(hl cos beta)/(a\u00b2) + 2(kl cos alpha)/(a\u00b2)\n\nWait, but in this case, a = b = c = a0, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.\n\nSo substituting, 1/d\u00b2 = [h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha ] / a\u00b2\n\nWhich, with all angles 30 degrees, becomes:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = [h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos30 + 2hl cos30 + 2kl cos30 ] / a\u00b2\n\nSo for h=k=l=1,\n\n1/d\u00b2 = [1 + 1 + 1 + 2(1)(1)(\u221a3/2) *3 ] / a\u00b2\n\nWait, because each of the three terms (hk, hl, kl) is 1*1, and there are three terms, so 2*(1)(1)(cos30) *3.\n\nWait, 2*(1)(1) cos30 for each pair, and there are three pairs: hk, hl, kl. So 3 * 2 * (1)(1) cos30.\n\nSo that's 6*(\u221a3/2) = 3\u221a3.\n\nSo numerator becomes:\n\n3 + 3\u221a3 \u2248 3 + 5.196 \u2248 8.196.\n\nSo 1/d\u00b2 = 8.196 / (10)^2 \u2192 8.196 / 100 = 0.08196.\n\nThen d\u00b2 = 1/0.08196 \u2248 12.201 \u2192 d \u2248 3.49 Angstrom.\n\nBut wait, the options are all around 9 Angstrom. That's way off. So I must have messed up the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. Another approach: for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be found using:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 )\n\nWhere \u03b8 is the angle between the lattice vectors (30 degrees here).\n\nSo for (111), h=k=l=1.\n\nSo denominator: sqrt(1 +1 +1 + 2*(1+1+1)*cos30 )\n\nWhich is sqrt(3 + 6*(\u221a3/2)).\n\n\u221a3 is approx 1.732, so \u221a3 \u22481.732. So 6*(\u221a3/2)=3\u221a3\u22485.196.\n\nSo denominator: sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)\u22482.863.\n\nSo d= a / 2.863 = 10 / 2.863 \u2248 3.49 Angstrom.\n\nSame result as before. But the options are way larger, so I'm definitely doing something wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the correct formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )\n\nWait, but wait, in a rhombohedral system, alpha, beta, gamma are the angles between the vectors. So, in the formula, cos(alpha) is the angle between a and b vectors, which is 30 degrees. Similarly, cos(beta) is between a and c, which is 30, and cos(gamma) between b and c is 30.\n\nWait, but in the formula, the denominator is h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Wait, I think the formula is:\n\nd\u00b2 = a\u00b2 (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha )^(-1)\n\nWait, no, the formula I have is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) + 2(hk cos gamma)/(a\u00b2) + 2(hl cos beta)/(a\u00b2) + 2(kl cos alpha)/(a\u00b2)\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = [ h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha ] / a\u00b2\n\nSo, substituting the (111) plane:\n\nh=1, k=1, l=1,\n\nSo,\n\n1/d\u00b2 = [1 +1 +1 + 2(1)(1) cos gamma + 2(1)(1) cos beta + 2(1)(1) cos alpha ] / a\u00b2\n\nSince alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees,\n\ncos30 = sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866.\n\nSo,\n\n1/d\u00b2 = [3 + 2(0.866) *3 ] / a\u00b2 \u2192 3 + 6*(0.866) = 3 +5.196 =8.196.\n\nSo, 1/d\u00b2 = 8.196 / (10)^2 \u2192 8.196 /100 = 0.08196.\n\nThus, d\u00b2=1/0.08196\u224812.201, so d\u22483.49 Angstrom.\n\nBut the options given are all around 9 Angstrom. So I must have a wrong approach.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Perhaps the given interatomic distance isn't the lattice parameter a. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance could be different from the lattice parameter. Oh wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors. So in a primitive lattice, the interatomic distance would be a, but perhaps in some cases, it's different. Wait, no, the interatomic distance is the same as a, the lattice parameter, in a primitive unit cell.\n\nWait, but maybe in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is different. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing interatomic distance with the unit cell edge. Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps a is 10 Angstrom.\n\nBut then the calculation leads to d\u22483.49, which isn't any of the options. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Another approach: the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )\n\nBut perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )\n\nWait, that would change the denominator. Let me try that.\n\nSo for (111):\n\nDenominator: sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * cos30)).\n\nCompute cos30=0.866, so 3*0.866=2.598.\n\nSo denominator: sqrt(3 - 2*2.598) \u2192 sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). That's imaginary. Impossible. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps I should use the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system with a given volume and unit cell. Wait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )) )\n\nWait, but in that case, the same calculation as before.\n\nHmm. I must be missing something. Let me think about another possibility. Maybe the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )\n\nWait, let's plug in h=k=l=1, theta=30.\n\nSo denominator: sqrt(3 - 2*(3)*0.866) \u2192 sqrt(3 - 5.196)=sqrt(-2.196) \u2192 which is impossible. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the formula reversed. Maybe it's:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )\n\nWait, but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so it's 30 degrees. So,\n\nDenominator: sqrt(3 + 2*(3 * cos30) )\n\nWhich is sqrt(3 + 2*(3)(0.866))= sqrt(3 +5.196)= sqrt(8.196)=2.863.\n\nSo d = 10 / 2.863 \u22483.49 Angstrom.\n\nSame result as before. But the options are all around 9 Angstrom, which is about 3 times bigger. So perhaps the formula is using a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the reciprocal of d. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180 - theta) )\n\nBecause in some cases, the angle used in the formula is the supplementary angle. Hmm, wait, the angle between the lattice vectors is theta, but perhaps the formula uses the angle between the planes, which is 180-theta.\n\nWait, the angle in the formula is the angle between the vectors, but if the structure is non-orthogonal, perhaps we need to consider the angle as 180 - theta. Let's try that.\n\nSo cos(180 -30) = cos150 = -sqrt(3)/2 \u2248-0.866.\n\nSo substituting, the denominator becomes:\n\nsqrt(3 + 2*(3)(-0.866)) \u2192 sqrt(3 + 2*(-2.598)) \u2192 sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). Again, imaginary. So no.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should consider that the formula for d uses the reciprocal lattice vector. Wait, the reciprocal lattice vector components are given by h, k, l, but perhaps I'm missing some terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the volume of the unit cell to find the reciprocal lattice vectors. The volume V is a^3 (1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta ), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: The volume of the unit cell for a rhombohedral system is V = a^3 (1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta )\n\nWith a=10 Angstrom, theta=30 degrees.\n\nCompute cos30: sqrt(3)/2\u22480.866.\n\nSo V =10^3 * (1 -3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 )\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n0.866^2 = 0.75, 0.866^3\u22480.866 * 0.75\u22480.6495.\n\nSo,\n\n1 -3*(0.75) =1 -2.25= -1.25.\n\n+ 2*(0.6495)=1.299.\n\nSo total: -1.25 +1.299=0.049.\n\nSo V=1000 *0.049=49 cubic Angstrom.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure how this helps with the interplanar distance.\n\nWait, the formula for interplanar distance can also be expressed as:\n\nd_{hkl} = (sqrt( V )) / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )) )\n\nWait, I'm not sure about this. Let me see: the volume of the unit cell is V = a^3 (1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta ), and the reciprocal lattice vectors' magnitude is related to d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for d is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )\n\nBut that's the same formula I used earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta ) )\n\nWhich gives d=3.49 Angstrom for (111). But the options are much higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Wait, the question says \"rhombohedral crystal\" with interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom. So perhaps the interatomic distance is not 'a' but the distance between atoms in the structure, which might be different in a rhombohedral lattice.\n\nWait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the interatomic distance is a * sqrt( something ), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is given as the distance between nearest neighbors, which in a rhombohedral structure is along the edge of the unit cell, so a=10 Angstrom. So that part is correct.\n\nHmm, but according to all the calculations, the interplanar distance for (111) is about 3.49 Angstrom, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the question is about the (222) plane or another plane. Or maybe I misread the plane indices.\n\nWait, the question is about the (111) plane. So I must have done something wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the formula inverted. Maybe the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2(hk cos theta + hl cos theta + kl cos theta) )\n\nWait, no, that's what I've been using.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle in the formula is the angle between the planes, which is different. Alternatively, maybe the formula uses the angle between the crystallographic axes, but I've been using the angle between the vectors.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWhich is the same as before. So I'm stuck.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Let me think about the structure of a rhombohedral crystal. In a rhombohedral structure, the planes are at certain angles. The (111) plane would cut the edges of the unit cell at 1:1:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Miller indices and the lattice parameters, I can find the distance between two adjacent lattice planes. The formula for the interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vector components are (h, k, l) in terms of the original lattice vectors. But for a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal vectors are more complex.\n\nWait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:\n\nb1 = (1/a)(1, 1, 1) / (sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(cos30 + cos30 + cos30)) )\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the reciprocal vectors are calculated as:\n\nb1 = (1/a) (e1 + e2 + e3) / (1 + 2 cos theta )\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting into more confusion. Maybe it's better to use the formula for interplanar distance from the unit cell parameters.\n\nWait, another approach: The interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the plane normal vector in reciprocal space.\n\nThe normal vector in reciprocal space is (h, k, l). So the magnitude is sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo for (111), as we've calculated, d \u22483.49 Angstrom, but that's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the distance between adjacent planes along the (111) direction, but that's not the same as interplanar distance. Or perhaps I should consider the distance in a different way.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell edges and angles. Alternatively, maybe the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2hk cos(alpha) + 2hl cos(beta) + 2kl cos(gamma) )\n\nWait, that's the same as the earlier formula. So for (111), that gives the same denominator as before.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the angles given are the angles between the planes, not the angles between the lattice vectors. But I think that's not the case. The question says the angles alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, which are the angles between the lattice vectors.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are around 9-10 Angstrom, which is about three times the interatomic distance. So maybe the formula uses a different approach.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nBut wait, that's the same as before. So with h=1, k=1, l=1, and theta=30.\n\nSo denominator sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2))= sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).\n\nsqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3*1.732=5.196. So denominator sqrt(3+5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.\n\nd=10/2.863\u22483.49 Angstrom.\n\nHmm, but that's way off the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWhich would give denominator sqrt(3 - 6*0.866)=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). Impossible.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the angles are 180-30=150 degrees. Let me try that.\n\ncos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2 \u2248-0.866.\n\nSo denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*(-0.866))= sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196)\u2192 impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses the angle between the planes. Wait, the angle between the planes would be different. But I'm not sure how that's calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nBut then the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 2*(3)(0.866))= sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196)\u2192 again impossible.\n\nHmm, this is getting me nowhere. Perhaps I should try another approach, considering the volume of the unit cell.\n\nThe volume V is a^3 (1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta )\n\nWith a=10, theta=30 degrees.\n\nSo V=1000*(1 -3*(3/4) + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n1 - 3*(3/4) =1 - 9/4= -5/4.\n\n2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 )=2*( (3*sqrt(3))/8 )= (3*sqrt(3))/4 \u2248 (5.196)/4\u22481.299.\n\nSo V=1000*( -5/4 + 1.299 )=1000*( -1.25 +1.299 )=1000*(0.049)=49 cubic Angstrom.\n\nHmm, the volume is 49.\n\nBut how does that help me find the interplanar distance?\n\nThe interplanar distance d_{hkl} can also be calculated as d = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWhich is what I've been using. So for (111), d\u22483.49 Angstrom. But the options are much larger.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a * sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWhich would make d much larger. Let me try that.\n\nh=k=l=1, theta=30.\n\nSo sqrt(3 +6*0.866)=sqrt(3+5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.\n\nSo d=10 *2.863\u224828.63 Angstrom. No, that's even larger than the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a * sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWhich would be sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). Impossible.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the reciprocal of d. Wait, if the options are around 9 Angstrom, which is roughly 3 times the interatomic distance, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) ) / something.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nBut then for (111), as before, d\u22483.49. But perhaps the question is about the (222) plane. Let me try that.\n\nh=k=l=2.\n\nDenominator: sqrt(4+4+4 + 2*(4+4+4)*0.866 )\n\n= sqrt(12 + 24*(0.866))= sqrt(12 +20.784)=sqrt(32.784)=5.726.\n\nSo d=10/5.726\u22481.746 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the interatomic distance isn't 'a' but another parameter. Let's think: in a rhombohedral structure, the distance between two adjacent atoms is along the edge of the unit cell, so a is the interatomic distance. So a=10.\n\nBut maybe the unit cell is not primitive. Wait, perhaps the unit cell is a face-centered or body-centered rhombohedral, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nBut with a=10, for (111) that gives d\u22483.49, which isn't in the options. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the way the angles are used. Let me double-check: in the formula, the angles between the lattice vectors are used, which are 30 degrees. But perhaps the formula uses the angles between the planes, which would be different.\n\nWait, the angle between the planes (the interplanar angle) isn't the same as the angle between the lattice vectors. Hmm, but I'm not sure how to calculate that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180-theta) )\n\nBecause the angle between the planes is 180-theta. Let's try theta=30, so 180-30=150 degrees, cos150= -sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo denominator: sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*(-0.866))=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). Still impossible.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me think if there's any other way to approach this.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nBut that would give for (111):\n\nsqrt(3 - 6*0.866)=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). No good.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses the supplement angle, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWhich gives d=3.49, but the options are much larger. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm missing a factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a, but a multiplied by something. For example, in a hexagonal close-packed structure, the interatomic distance is a/2, but that's for hexagonal, not rhombohedral.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between nearest atoms, which is along the edge of the unit cell, so a=10.\n\nBut then why is the calculated d not matching the options?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the (111) planes are not as close as I'm calculating. But I don't know another formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system again.\n\nUpon reflection, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha )\n\nIn this case, since alpha=beta=gamma=30, and h=k=l=1,\n\nd = a / sqrt(3 + 6*(cos30)).\n\nWhich is 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(0.866)).\n\nCompute denominator: 3 +6*0.866=3+5.196=8.196.\n\nsqrt(8.196)=2.863.\n\nSo d=10/2.863\u22483.49 Angstrom.\n\nBut again, the options are all around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) * sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )^{-1/2}.\n\nNo, that's the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )\n\nBut for (111), that gives sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180-theta) )\n\nWhich would be cos150= -0.866.\n\nSo denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 6*(-0.866))=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). Impossible.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of another approach. Perhaps the problem is about the (200) plane instead of (111). Let me try that.\n\nFor (200):\n\nh=2, k=0, l=0.\n\nSo denominator: sqrt(4 +0 +0 + 0 +0 +0 )=2.\n\nd=10/2=5 Angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nWait, but the options are 9.08, 8.95, etc. So perhaps the plane is (220) or (200).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nBut that gives imaginary numbers for (111).\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWhich is what I've been using.\n\nWait, perhaps the given angles are the external angles, but I'm using the internal angles. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos(alpha) + hl cos(beta) + kl cos(gamma) ) )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is considering a different type of rhombohedral system, such as a trigonal system with a different relation between a and the interatomic distance.\n\nWait, another possibility: The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nBut perhaps the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30. Let me see.\n\nIf theta=60, then cos60=0.5.\n\nDenominator: sqrt(3 +6*(0.5))=sqrt(3+3)=sqrt(6)=2.449.\n\nd=10/2.449\u22484.08 Angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angles are 120 degrees. cos120= -0.5.\n\nDenominator: sqrt(3 +6*(-0.5))=sqrt(3-3)=0. So d= infinity. Impossible.\n\nHmm. I'm really not getting anywhere. Maybe I should try to find the correct formula from another angle.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWhich gives d=3.49 Angstrom. But since the options are much larger, perhaps the correct answer isn't among them, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think: The problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. But in a rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance could be a different parameter. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is along the edge of the unit cell, so a is the interatomic distance. So a=10.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of a. No, that would give a much smaller d.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the problem is using the (100) plane. Let's compute that.\n\nh=1, k=0, l=0.\n\nDenominator: sqrt(1 +0+0 +0 +0 +0 )=1.\n\nSo d=10/1=10 Angstrom. Option D is 10.05, close to 10.\n\nBut the question is about the (111) plane. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest option is not present. But that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to use a different plane.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Another source I recall says that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be found using:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWhich is what I've been using.\n\nGiven that, I'm confident that the calculation leads to d\u22483.49 Angstrom, but the options don't include this. So perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )^{-1}\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWhich again gives d=3.49.\n\nHmm. I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, none of the options match. But since the options are all around 9 Angstrom, perhaps I should recheck the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.\n\nFor (111):\n\nh=1, k=1, l=1.\n\nCompute the denominator:\n\nsqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 +1*1)*cos30 )\n\nWhich is sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*0.866)\n\n= sqrt(3 + 5.196)=sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.\n\nSo d=10 / 2.863 \u22483.49.\n\nWait, but the options are around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I should invert the formula.\n\nWait, what if the formula is:\n\nd = 1 / [ sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/(a^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta)/(a^2) ) ]\n\nWhich would make d=1/sqrt(8.196/100)=1/(0.2863)=3.49 Angstrom. Same result.\n\nHmm. I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but given the options, the closest is none. But since the options don't match, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the given angles are the angles between the planes, not the lattice vectors. But I don't know how to calculate that.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the problem is about a hexagonal close-packed structure, but the question says rhombohedral.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think of another formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWhich gives 3.49, but the options don't match. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the distance between adjacent (111) planes, which would be the same as the interplanar distance. So I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the denominator again.\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 =3.\n\n2*(hk + hl + kl)= 2*(1+1+1)=6.\n\ncos30=0.866.\n\nSo 6*0.866=5.196.\n\nSo denominator: sqrt(3+5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.\n\nd=10/2.863= approx 3.49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut since the options are way off, perhaps the problem is using a different formula. Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30.\n\nIf theta=60, cos60=0.5.\n\nDenominator: sqrt(3 +6*0.5)=sqrt(3+3)=sqrt(6)=2.449.\n\nd=10/2.449\u22484.08 Angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Given that, I think the correct answer according to the formula is approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but since it's not an option, perhaps the question has an error. However, the options given are:\n\nA) 9.08\n\nB)8.95\n\nC)9.54\n\nD)10.05\n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think of another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated using the face diagonal or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 )\n\nBut that would be for a cubic system. For (111), d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 Angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the formula is:\n\nd = a * sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) ) / (something else )\n\nBut I can't think of what.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula uses the volume.\n\nThe volume is 49, as calculated earlier. But how to use that.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a^2) / (sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )) )\n\nWhich would give d=100/2.863\u224834.9 Angstrom. No.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but that's not among the options. Perhaps I should choose the closest option, but none are close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system as:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWhich gives 3.49, but the options are much larger.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the unit cell is not primitive. For example, in a face-centered or body-centered structure, the interplanar distance could be different. But I'm not sure how that affects the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWhich again gives 3.49.\n\nHmm. I think I'm stuck. Based on the information, the correct answer should be around 3.49 Angstrom, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 9.54, but I'm not sure how that would be derived.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses the inverse of the angles. For example, using cos(60) instead of cos(30). Let me try that.\n\ncos60=0.5.\n\nDenominator: sqrt(3 +6*0.5)=sqrt(6)=2.449.\n\nd=10/2.449\u22484.08 Angstrom.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula uses 180-theta, which would be cos(150)= -0.866.\n\nDenominator: sqrt(3 +6*(-0.866))=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). Impossible.\n\nHmm. I think I'm stuck. I'll have to go with the calculation I have, even though it doesn't match the options. But since the options don't include it, perhaps the correct answer is missing. Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nBut for (111), this would give sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So no.\n\nHmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the formula, the correct answer is approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but since it's not an option, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. However, among the options, none match, so I'm not sure.\n\n\nTo determine the interplanar distance \\( d_{hkl} \\) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \\cos\\theta}}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( a = 10 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\) (interatomic distance),\n- \\( h = k = l = 1 \\) (Miller indices for the (111) plane),\n- \\( \\theta = 30^\\circ \\) (angles between lattice vectors).\n\n### Step 1: Compute the denominator\nThe denominator is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \\cos\\theta}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( h = k = l = 1 \\) and \\( \\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Numerator inside the square root} = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1) \\cdot 0.866\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 3 + 2(3) \\cdot 0.866 = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Denominator} = \\sqrt{8.196} \\approx 2.863\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute \\( d_{hkl} \\)\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{10}{2.863} \\approx 3.49 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compare with the options\nThe calculated interplanar distance \\( d_{hkl} \\approx 3.49 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9\u201310 \u00c5.
