      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question says there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means all the EDTA is in its deprotonated form, so it can bind calcium. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.\n\nWait, what do I remember about formation constants? Formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion. So for the reaction Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u21cc CaEDTA^2-, the Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]).\n\nOh, right. So the problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. Since it's stoichiometric, I guess that means all the calcium is bound by EDTA. But wait, no, maybe not all. Because even when they form the complex, some of the calcium might dissociate a little, especially considering the Kf is large, but I think in this case, since Kf is big (5e10), the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ should be very low.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial concentration is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of Ca\u00b2+ plus the complex should equal 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA\u00b2-] as 0.02 M, but actually, maybe that's the initial concentration before any dissociation. Hmm, no, I think the solution is already the complex, so the total calcium species is 0.02 M. So [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaEDTA\u00b2-] = 0.02 M.\n\nWait, no, wait. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So perhaps the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the rest is the free ions. But in that case, the Kf would help us find the free calcium.\n\nWait, maybe I should write the expression. Let's let [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ and y be the concentration of free EDTA^4-. Since the reaction is Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u21cc CaEDTA^2-, the stoichiometry is 1:1.\n\nSo, Kf = [CaEDTA\u00b2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.\n\nWe also know that the total calcium is [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaEDTA\u00b2-] = 0.02 M. Wait, but [CaEDTA\u00b2-] is 0.02, so [Ca\u00b2+] = 0.02 - [CaEDTA\u00b2-] but wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, no. Because [CaEDTA\u00b2-] is 0.02 M, and the total calcium is the sum of free Ca\u00b2+ and the complex. So [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaEDTA\u00b2-] = 0.02 M. So [Ca\u00b2+] = 0.02 - [CaEDTA\u00b2-]. Wait, but that would imply that [Ca\u00b2+] is zero if the complex is all there. That can't be right because the Kf is large but not infinite, so a tiny bit of Ca\u00b2+ must be present.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, then the total concentration of calcium is 0.02 M, because each complex has one Ca\u00b2+ ion. So [Ca\u00b2+] (free) plus [CaEDTA\u00b2-] equals 0.02 M. Similarly, the EDTA is all in the form of EDTA^4- and the complex. Wait, but EDTA is a hexadentate ligand; in solution, it exists in various protonated forms. Oh, but the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I guess all the EDTA is in the form of EDTA^4-.\n\nSo the initial concentration of EDTA is equal to the concentration of the complex, right? Because each complex has one EDTA. Wait, no. Let me clarify. The solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is 0.02 M (all in complex?), but when it dissociates, some comes out as free Ca\u00b2+ and free EDTA^4-.\n\nWait, no. The complex is CaEDTA\u00b2-. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of that. So the initial [CaEDTA\u00b2-] is 0.02 M. The free [Ca\u00b2+] and [EDTA^4-] are both zero, but that can't be. Wait, no, because when you dissolve the complex, some will dissociate into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nSo, let me model this.\n\nLet me denote the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, because for every mole of CaEDTA\u00b2- that dissociates, you get one mole of each.\n\nSo, [CaEDTA\u00b2-] = 0.02 - x (but wait, no, because the initial [CaEDTA\u00b2-] is 0.02 M, and when x moles dissociate, the [CaEDTA\u00b2-] becomes 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large, 5e10, x will be very small, so 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nWait, but let's proceed correctly. The formation constant Kf is:\n\nKf = [CaEDTA\u00b2-]/( [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-] ) =5e10.\n\nAssume that [CaEDTA\u00b2-] \u2248 0.02 M, and that [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x (since each dissociation gives one of each).\n\nSo substituting:\n\n5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) => 5e10 = 0.02 / x\u00b2.\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-13.\n\nWait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2 because 6.5*2 is 13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7.\n\nSo x is about 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca\u00b2+] is 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the setup.\n\nThe initial assumption is that [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA\u00b2-] is 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large, the dissociation is minimal, so x is very small, and 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02. So that approximation should hold.\n\nSo substituting, Kf = 5e10 = (0.02)/(x^2). So x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2 /5e10 = 2/(5e12) = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 \u2248 6.3e-7 M. So the concentration is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca\u00b2\u207a]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \\( K_{\\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \\times 10^{10} \\). The reaction is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ca}^{2+} + \\text{EDTA}^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}\n\\]\n\n### Key Assumptions:\n1. The total concentration of calcium species is given as 0.02 M, which includes both free calcium ions ([Ca\u00b2\u207a]) and the complex ([CaEDTA\u00b2\u207b]).\n2. The pH is ideal, meaning all EDTA is in the form of \\(\\text{EDTA}^{4-}\\).\n3. Let \\( x \\) represent the concentration of free \\(\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\text{EDTA}^{4-}\\). Since the dissociation of the complex produces one \\(\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\) and one \\(\\text{EDTA}^{4-}\\), their concentrations are equal.\n\n### Formation Constant Expression:\n\\[\nK_{\\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \\frac{[\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting:\n- \\([\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \\approx 0.02 \\, \\text{M}\\) (since dissociation is minimal due to the large \\( K_{\\text{Ca-EDTA}} \\)),\n- \\([\\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\\),\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02}{x^2}\n\\]\n\n### Solving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M}\n\\]\n\nThus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \\( 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M} \\), which corresponds to option **C**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n\\]",
