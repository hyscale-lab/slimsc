      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, I think. So the mass number A is 6.\n\nWait, but the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li normally has atomic number Z=3. So with 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6, yes. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, probably a deuteron or something else, but I'm not sure. Well, maybe the exact isotope isn't crucial for the calculation. I just need the mass number for the relativistic energy calculation.\n\nThe question is about finding the energy of the ion. So I think this is a relativistic energy problem, probably using the gamma factor. Because when particles move at speeds close to c, their relativistic mass increases, which affects the total energy.\n\nSo the formula I remember is the total energy E = gamma * m0 * c\u00b2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can compute gamma first.\n\nLet me compute gamma. v = 0.96c, so v\u00b2 = (0.96)^2 c\u00b2. Let's calculate that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.\n\nNow, the denominator in gamma is sqrt(0.0784). Let's compute that. sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 \u2248 3.5714.\n\nWait, 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857. Hmm. Let me double-check that. 0.28 times 3.5714 is indeed 1, right? Because 0.28 * 3 = 0.84, 0.28 * 0.5714 \u2248 0.16. So 0.84 + 0.16 is 1. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.\n\nSo now I need to find the rest mass energy m0 c\u00b2. Since the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6, I think the rest mass energy is approximately 6 times the mass of a proton. Wait, but the proton mass is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, right? So 6 * 938 MeV is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The mass of a nucleus isn't exactly A times the mass of a proton. Because when nucleons come together, there's mass defect due to binding energy. But for heavy ions like this, I think in the context of a problem like this, the rest mass is approximated as A times the proton mass. So perhaps the exact value isn't needed because the options are in GeV, and the calculation will use the approximate value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses the mass of the deuteron or something else. Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons. So the mass is about 6 * (proton mass). So m0 c\u00b2 would be 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure about the mass of Li-6. I remember that the mass of a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c\u00b2, and the proton is about 938.272 MeV/c\u00b2. So the average might be around 938.5 MeV. But perhaps the problem expects me to use m_p = 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So for 6 nucleons, it's 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.\n\nSo then, the total energy E = gamma * m0 c\u00b2 = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.\n\nLet me compute that. 3.5714 multiplied by 5.628.\n\nWait, 3.5714 times 5 is 17.857, 3.5714 times 0.628 is about 2.24. So adding those gives approximately 20.1 GeV. Hmm, but let me compute it more accurately.\n\n3.5714 * 5.628:\n\nCompute 3 * 5.628 = 16.884.\n\n0.5714 * 5.628: Let's compute that.\n\n0.5 * 5.628 = 2.814\n\n0.0714 * 5.628 \u2248 0.404.\n\nSo 2.814 + 0.404 = 3.218.\n\nSo total is 16.884 + 3.218 = 20.102 GeV. Hmm, so approximately 20.102 GeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made an approximation in the gamma calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more accurately. v = 0.96c, so v\u00b2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216.\n\nSo 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.\n\nsqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 \u2248 3.57142857.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should calculate gamma with more precision.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. Wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so it's exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857... So no problem there.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the mass isn't exactly 6 * 938 MeV. Let me think. The mass of Li-6 is known; maybe I should look it up. Wait, I can't look it up, but I can recall that the binding energy for light nuclei isn't that big. For example, the mass of Carbon-12 is about 12 * 938 MeV minus the binding energy. But I think for this problem, the approximation is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass number A and the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) as 938 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo E = gamma * m0 c\u00b2 = 3.57142857 * 5.628 GeV.\n\nWait, 3.57142857 * 5.628 GeV.\n\nWait, 3.57142857 is 25/7, because 3.57142857 is 25/7 \u2248 3.57142857.\n\nSo 25/7 * 5.628 GeV.\n\n5.628 is approximately 5.628 GeV.\n\nWait, 25 *5.628 = 140.7, divided by 7 is about 20.1.\n\nHmm, but the exact calculation would be better.\n\nLet me compute 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.628.\n\nSo 3.57142857 * 5.628:\n\nLet me break this down:\n\n3 * 5.628 = 16.884\n\n0.57142857 * 5.628 = ?\n\nCompute 0.5 *5.628 =2.814.\n\n0.07142857 *5.628 \u2248 0.404 (because 0.07142857 is 1/14, and 5.628 * 1/14 is approximately 0.402).\n\nSo adding 2.814 +0.402=3.216.\n\nSo total is 16.884 +3.216 = 20.1 GeV.\n\nSo approximately 20.1 GeV. But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. So that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is not exactly 6 * 938 MeV. Let me think: the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 5.628 GeV/c\u00b2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the mass of the Li-6 atom. The atomic mass is known. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.013 atomic mass units (u). Since 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c\u00b2, so 6.013 * 931.5 \u2248 6.013 * 931.5 \u2248 Let me calculate that.\n\n6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, 0.013 *931.5 \u2248 12.1095 MeV. So total is 5601.1 MeV, which is 5.6011 GeV.\n\nWait, so the actual rest mass energy is about 5.6011 GeV, not 5.628 GeV. Because 6 * 938 would be 5.628 GeV, but the actual is lower due to binding energy.\n\nSo that would change the calculation. So the rest mass is 5.6011 GeV.\n\nSo then, E = gamma * m0 c\u00b2 = 3.57142857 * 5.6011 GeV.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3.57142857 *5.6011.\n\nHmm, let's compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.\n\n3.57142857 *0.6011 = ?\n\nCompute 3.57142857 * 0.6 = 2.14285714.\n\n3.57142857 * 0.0011 = approximately 0.00392857.\n\nSo 2.14285714 + 0.00392857 = 2.14678571.\n\nAdding to 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.14678571 = 20.00392856 GeV.\n\nSo approximately 20.004 GeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20.132, which is higher than this. Option D is 21.419, which is higher. Option B is 23.069, which is even higher.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the exact value of the mass.\n\nWait, the problem says that X is Li with 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6. The exact mass of Li-6 isotope can be found in tables. I think the mass is about 5.6011 GeV/c\u00b2, as I calculated.\n\nSo E = 3.57142857 * 5.6011 \u2248 20.004 GeV.\n\nBut none of the options exactly match that. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, but that's a bit higher. Hmm. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma. Let me recompute gamma with more precision.\n\nv = 0.96c, so beta = 0.96.\n\nGamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2).\n\n0.96^2 is 0.9216.\n\nSo 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.\n\nsqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714...\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the mass is not 5.6011 GeV, but higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of the mass of Li-6.\n\nWait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0136731 u. Let me compute that.\n\n6.0136731 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.0136731 * 931.5 \u2248 Let me compute that.\n\n6 *931.5=5589 MeV.\n\n0.0136731 *931.5 = ?\n\n0.01 *931.5=9.315\n\n0.0036731 *931.5 \u2248 3.426\n\nSo total for 0.0136731 is 9.315 + 3.426 = 12.741.\n\nSo 5589 + 12.741 = 5601.741 MeV, which is 5.601741 GeV.\n\nSo m0 c\u00b2 is approximately 5.601741 GeV.\n\nSo E = gamma * m0 c\u00b2 = 3.57142857 * 5.601741 GeV.\n\nLet me compute that more accurately.\n\n3.57142857 *5.601741.\n\nLet me compute 3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.\n\n3.57142857 *0.601741 = ?\n\nHmm, 3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.14285714.\n\n3.57142857 *0.001741 \u2248 0.006201.\n\nSo 0.601741 is 0.6 +0.001741.\n\nSo 3.57142857 *0.601741 = 2.14285714 + 0.006201 \u2248 2.149058.\n\nSo total E is 17.85714285 +2.149058 \u2248 20.0062 GeV.\n\nSo approximately 20.006 GeV.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is 20.132, which is higher. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the charge state. Li-6 has 3 protons, but in the collider, it's perhaps a deuteron (Li-6 with charge +2?), or maybe it's fully ionized, so it's a bare nucleus with charge +3. Does that affect the mass? I don't think so because the mass is given by the number of nucleons. The charge state would affect the binding energy, but for a nucleus like Li-6, the binding energy is small compared to the rest mass.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the problem is using the mass of the free nucleon, i.e., considering each nucleon (proton and neutron) as having a mass of 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total would be 6 * 938 =5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.\n\nSo then, E =3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.\n\nLet me compute that accurately.\n\n3.57142857 *5.628 = ?\n\n3 *5.628 =16.884.\n\n0.57142857 *5.628 = ?\n\n0.5 *5.628 =2.814.\n\n0.07142857 *5.628 = 0.404 (since 5.628 * 0.07142857 is approximately 0.404).\n\nSo 2.814 +0.404 =3.218.\n\nSo total is 16.884 +3.218 =20.102 GeV.\n\nSo approximately 20.102 GeV. So looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. Hmm, perhaps I should consider more precise values.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).\n\nLet me compute 0.96^2 exactly: 0.96*0.96=0.9216.\n\n1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.\n\nsqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.\n\nSo gamma is exactly 3.5714285714...\n\nNow, the mass using 6 *938 MeV is 5.628 GeV.\n\nSo E =3.5714285714 *5.628.\n\nLet me compute this more accurately.\n\n3.5714285714 *5.628.\n\nCompute 3.5714285714 *5 = 17.857142857.\n\n3.5714285714 *0.628 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3.5714285714 *0.6 =2.1428571428.\n\n3.5714285714 *0.028 =0.100.\n\nSo 0.628 is 0.6 +0.028.\n\nSo 2.1428571428 +0.100 =2.2428571428.\n\nSo total E =17.857142857 +2.2428571428 =20.1000000 GeV.\n\nWait, that's exactly 20.1 GeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, so why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption about the rest mass is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem defines X as Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 5.6011 GeV/c\u00b2, as I calculated earlier. So using that, E would be approximately 20.004 GeV, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the problem expects me to use 6 *938 MeV, leading to 20.1 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the deuteron, which is about 2 *938 MeV =1.876 GeV, but that doesn't fit here because Li-6 has 6 nucleons.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers the mass as 6 *938 MeV, so 5.628 GeV, leading to E=20.1 GeV, which is option C. But the options don't have 20.1, but option C is 20.132.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me compute gamma again.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1 / sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.57142857.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation is done using more precise values. Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.628 GeV more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 3.57142857 *5.628.\n\n3.57142857 \u00d7 5.628.\n\nLet me do this multiplication step by step.\n\n3.57142857 \u00d75 =17.85714285.\n\n3.57142857 \u00d70.628 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3.57142857 \u00d70.6 = 2.14285714.\n\n3.57142857 \u00d70.028 =0.100.\n\nSo 2.14285714 +0.100 =2.24285714.\n\nAdding to 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.24285714 =20.100000 GeV.\n\nSo exactly 20.1 GeV.\n\nBut option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. Hmm. Maybe the actual rest mass is a bit higher than 5.628 GeV.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the exact value of beta as 0.96, leading to a slightly more precise calculation of gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise methods. Let me compute 1 - (0.96)^2 = 0.0784 exactly. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is 3.5714285714... So no, that's precise.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the mass of Li-6. Let me find the exact mass.\n\nLi-6 has an atomic mass of about 6.0136731 u. 1 u is exactly 931.494065 MeV/c\u00b2. So:\n\n6.0136731 u \u00d7931.494065 MeV/u = ?\n\nLet me compute 6 \u00d7931.494065 =5588.96439 MeV.\n\n0.0136731 \u00d7931.494065 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n0.01 \u00d7931.494065=9.31494065.\n\n0.0036731 \u00d7931.494065 \u2248 3.4263 (approx).\n\nSo total is 9.31494065 +3.4263 \u224812.74124065.\n\nSo total MeV is 5588.96439 +12.74124065 =5601.70563 MeV, which is 5.60170563 GeV.\n\nSo m0 c\u00b2 is 5.60170563 GeV.\n\nNow, gamma is 3.57142857.\n\nSo E =3.57142857 *5.60170563.\n\nLet me compute this precisely.\n\n3.57142857 \u00d75.60170563.\n\nI can write this as (3 + 0.57142857) \u00d75.60170563.\n\n3 \u00d75.60170563 =16.80511689.\n\n0.57142857 \u00d75.60170563.\n\nCompute 0.5 \u00d75.60170563 =2.800852815.\n\n0.07142857 \u00d75.60170563.\n\n0.07 \u00d75.60170563 =0.3921193941.\n\n0.00142857 \u00d75.60170563 \u2248 0.0079999999 (approx 0.008).\n\nSo 0.3921193941 +0.008 =0.4001193941.\n\nSo 0.57142857 \u00d75.60170563 \u22482.800852815 +0.4001193941 =3.200972209.\n\nSo total E =16.80511689 +3.200972209 =20.0060891 GeV.\n\nSo approximately 20.006 GeV.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option C, 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the charge state. If the nucleus is charged, the mass might include the electrons. But in heavy ion colliders, the ions are typically fully stripped of electrons, so the charge state would be +3 for Li-6, which would mean 3 electrons are removed, each about 0.511 MeV. So the mass would be slightly higher by 3\u00d70.511 MeV =1.533 MeV, which is negligible compared to GeV.\n\nSo that's probably not the issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses the exact gamma calculation with more decimal places.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma using more precise beta.\n\nWait, beta is 0.96 exactly, so beta^2 is 0.9216, so 1 - beta^2 is 0.0784.\n\nsqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.5714285714...\n\nSo that's precise.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial assumption about the rest mass is incorrect. Maybe the problem uses the mass of the entire atom, including electrons. But for heavy ions, the electrons are negligible. The mass of the Li-6 atom is approximately 6.0136731 u, which is 5.6017 GeV as before. But if I include the electrons, which is 3 electrons (since Li has 3 electrons), each with mass 0.511 MeV, the total would be 3 *0.511 =1.533 MeV, which is 0.001533 GeV. So adding that to 5.6017 gives 5.6032 GeV. Then E =3.57142857 *5.6032 \u2248 ?\n\n3.57142857 *5.6032.\n\nAgain, 3 *5.6032 =16.8096.\n\n0.57142857 *5.6032.\n\n0.5 *5.6032 =2.8016.\n\n0.07142857 *5.6032 \u22480.4014.\n\nSo 2.8016 +0.4014=3.203.\n\nSo 16.8096 +3.203=20.0126 GeV.\n\nStill around 20.01 GeV.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is closest to option C, 20.132 GeV, but I'm not matching it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the rest mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons, without considering binding energy. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each neutron having a mass of about 939.565 MeV, and protons about 938.272 MeV.\n\nSo m0 c\u00b2 = 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = ?\n\n3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.\n\n3 *939.565 =2818.695 MeV.\n\nTotal: 2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.\n\nSo E = gamma * m0 c\u00b2 =3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3.57142857 *5.633511.\n\nCompute 3 *5.633511 =16.900533.\n\n0.57142857 *5.633511.\n\n0.5 *5.633511 =2.8167555.\n\n0.07142857 *5.633511 \u22480.404.\n\nSo 2.8167555 +0.404 =3.2207555.\n\nSo total E =16.900533 +3.2207555 =20.1212885 GeV.\n\nWhich is approximately 20.121 GeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.\n\nAh, so perhaps the problem expects the calculation to use the individual masses of the protons and neutrons without considering binding energy. That gives a rest mass of 5.6335 GeV, leading to E\u224820.12 GeV, which rounds to 20.132 GeV as option C.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus X (Li-6) is moving at 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy is given by:\n\n\\[\nE = \\gamma m_0 c^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \\) is the Lorentz factor, \\( m_0 c^2 \\) is the rest mass energy of the nucleus, and \\( v = 0.96c \\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\( \\gamma \\)\nThe speed \\( v = 0.96c \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{v}{c} = 0.96, \\quad \\beta^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1 - \\beta^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.5714\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \\( m_0 c^2 \\)\nThe nucleus is Li-6, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons).
