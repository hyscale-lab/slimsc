      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude has both real and imaginary parts, and they relate to different aspects of the scattering process.\n\nThe given phase shifts are \u03b40 = 90 degrees, \u03b41=67 degrees, \u03b42=55, \u03b43=30, and \u03b44=13 degrees. The rest are ignored, so I guess I only use these five. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I don't know if that's relevant for the calculation of the imaginary part, maybe just for the phase shifts?\n\nWait, I should recall the formula for the scattering amplitude. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(\u03b8) is given by a sum over the partial waves. The general expression is f(\u03b8) = (1/k) \u03a3 [ (2l + 1) e^{i\u03b4_l} sin\u03b4_l / (1 + cos\u03b8) ] for each l. But wait, along the incident direction, which is \u03b8=0 degrees. So cos\u03b8 would be 1. \n\nWait, but the question is specifically about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So perhaps I should find the imaginary component of f(\u03b8=0\u00b0). Let me think about the structure of f. The expression for f is a sum over l of (2l+1) [ e^{i\u03b4_l} sin\u03b4_l ] / (k (1 + cos\u03b8) ) * ... Wait, no, actually the standard form I think is f(\u03b8) = (1/k) \u03a3 (2l+1) (e^{2i\u03b4_l} - 1) / (2(1 + cos\u03b8)) ), but I'm not totally sure. Or wait, another approach: the partial wave expansion, where each term is (2l+1) [ e^{i\u03b4_l} sin\u03b4_l ] / (k (1 + cos\u03b8) ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. The scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is given by:\n\nf(\u03b8) = (1/(2ik)) \u03a3 (2l+1) [ e^{i\u03b4_l} (e^{-i\u03b4_l} - 1) ] / (1 + cos\u03b8) )\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, another formula I remember is:\n\nf(\u03b8) = (1/k) \u03a3 [ (2l +1) (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1) sin\u03b4_l ] / (1 + cos\u03b8) )\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think differently. The scattering amplitude for each partial wave l is given by:\n\nf_l(\u03b8) = (2l+1)/(k) * [ e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1 ] [ sin \u03b4_l ] / (1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, no, maybe another approach. The optical theorem comes into play here. The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. Oh wait, but the question is specifically about the imaginary part, so maybe that's the way to go.\n\nWait, the optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at \u03b8=0\u00b0 (forward direction) is related to the total cross-section. The formula is Im f(0) = (k/(4\u03c0)) \u03c3_total, where k is the wave number.\n\nBut how do I get \u03c3_total from the phase shifts? I think the total cross-section is given by the sum over l of (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) / (2k^2), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the total cross-section is given by (1/k^2) times the sum over l of (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l). Or perhaps it's (1/(2k^2)) times the sum over l of (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l). Wait, let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the total cross-section \u03c3_total is (4\u03c0/k\u00b2) times the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. Because from the optical theorem:\n\nIm f(0) = (k/(4\u03c0)) \u03c3_total\n\nSo, \u03c3_total = 4\u03c0 k Im f(0) / (k) ) \u2192 \u03c3_total = (4\u03c0/k) Im f(0)\n\nWait, no. Let me derive it correctly. Optical theorem says:\n\nIm f(0) = (k/(4\u03c0)) * \u03c3_total\n\nSo, \u03c3_total = (4\u03c0/k) Im f(0)\n\nBut I'm trying to find Im f(0), so perhaps I can compute \u03c3_total another way and plug it into this equation.\n\nSo, how to compute \u03c3_total using the phase shifts?\n\nYes, \u03c3_total is given by the sum over all partial waves of (2l + 1) sin(2 \u03b4_l) / (k^2). Because each partial wave contributes (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) /k\u00b2, and the sum is over l.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The differential cross-section is given by:\n\nd\u03c3/d\u03a9 = |f(\u03b8,\u03c6)|\u00b2 = (1/k\u00b2) \u03a3_{l,m} (2l+1) (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1)(e^{-i\u03b4_l} - 1) * ... Hmm, maybe that's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the total cross-section is the integral of the differential cross-section over all solid angles. But for that, I might need more information. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm thinking of is that \u03c3_total = 4\u03c0 \u222b (d\u03c3/d\u03a9) sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6, with \u03c6 integrated from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nBut integrating the differential cross-section over all solid angles gives the total cross-section. So, for each l, the contribution to d\u03c3/d\u03a9 is (2l+1) [ (sin \u03b4_l)^2 ] / (k\u00b2 (1 + cos\u03b8)^2) ), perhaps? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, if I'm trying to compute the total cross-section from the phase shifts, I think the formula is \u03c3_total = (4\u03c0/k\u00b2) \u03a3 (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) ) / (2) )\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The differential cross-section for each partial wave is (d\u03c3_l/d\u03a9) = ( (2l+1) sin^2 \u03b4_l ) / (k^2) )\n\nSo, since the scattering amplitude is f(\u03b8, \u03c6) = \u03a3 [ (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4_l} (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1) ] / (k (1 + cos\u03b8) ), but maybe I should not go into that.\n\nAlternatively, the differential cross-section for each l is (2l+1) sin^2 \u03b4_l / (k^2 (1 + cos\u03b8)^2 ), but when you integrate over all angles, the integration over \u03c6 from 0 to 2\u03c0 will just contribute a factor of 2\u03c0.\n\nSo, integrating d\u03c3/d\u03a9 over all solid angles would be:\n\n\u03c3_total = \u222b (d\u03c3/d\u03a9) 4\u03c0 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6\n\n= 4\u03c0 \u222b [ \u03a3 (2l+1) sin^2 \u03b4_l / (k^2 (1 + cos\u03b8)^2 ) ] sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6\n\nWait, but that's complicated. Hmm. Alternatively, there's a relation between the total cross-section and the phase shifts. I think it's given by \u03c3_total = (4\u03c0/k\u00b2) \u03a3 (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l) )\n\nBecause I remember that the integral of sin^2 \u03b4_l over all angles might relate to 2 sin \u03b4_l cos \u03b4_l = sin(2 \u03b4_l).\n\nWait, perhaps the total cross-section is (4\u03c0/k\u00b2) times the sum of (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l) ) / 2. Because when you integrate sin^2 \u03b4_l over all angles, the average would be something involving sin(2 \u03b4_l).\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the optical theorem. Since the optical theorem says that the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. So, perhaps the better approach is to compute the imaginary part of f(0) using the phase shifts.\n\nThe scattering amplitude in the partial wave expansion is:\n\nf(\u03b8) = (1/k) \u03a3 [ (2l + 1) e^{i \u03b4_l} sin \u03b4_l / (1 + cos\u03b8) ]\n\nWait, so for \u03b8=0\u00b0, 1+cos\u03b8 = 2. So,\n\nf(0) = (1/(2k)) \u03a3 [ (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} sin \u03b4_l ]\n\nThe imaginary part of f(0) is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) \u03a3 [ (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l * Im(e^{i \u03b4_l}) ]\n\nSince e^{i \u03b4_l} = cos \u03b4_l + i sin \u03b4_l, so Im(e^{i \u03b4_l}) = sin \u03b4_l.\n\nSo,\n\nIm f(0) = (1/(2k)) \u03a3 [ (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l * sin \u03b4_l ]\n\n= (1/(2k)) \u03a3 [ (2l+1) (sin \u03b4_l)^2 ]\n\nHmm, okay, so that gives me the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at \u03b8=0.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this sum. The given phase shifts are \u03b40=90\u00b0, \u03b41=67\u00b0, \u03b42=55\u00b0, \u03b43=30\u00b0, \u03b44=13\u00b0, and others are ignored.\n\nSo, l runs from 0 to 4, since higher l's are ignored. So, for each l=0,1,2,3,4, compute (2l+1)*(sin \u03b4_l)^2, sum them up, multiply by 1/(2k), and that gives Im f(0).\n\nBut wait, what is k? Because the wave number k is related to the momentum of the electrons. The electrons are 50 MeV, so I need to compute k.\n\nThe electrons are non-relativistic? 50 MeV is a pretty high energy, so perhaps they are relativistic. But let's think about the relation between energy and k.\n\nFor an electron, the energy E is related to the momentum p by E^2 = p^2 c^4 + m_e^2 c^4. But since E is given as 50 MeV, and the rest mass of electron is about 0.511 MeV, so E is much larger than m_e c\u00b2. Therefore, the electron is ultra-relativistic, and p \u2248 E / c.\n\nWait, but in natural units (\u0127=c=1), the momentum p is approximately E, but let me compute it accurately.\n\nE = 50 MeV = 50 \u00d7 10^6 eV.\n\nThe rest mass energy of electron is m_e c\u00b2 \u2248 0.511 MeV.\n\nSo, E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 c^4 + (m_e c\u00b2)^2 \u2192 p c = sqrt( E\u00b2 - (m_e c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nSo, p c = sqrt( (50e6 eV)^2 - (0.511e6 eV)^2 ) \u2248 50e6 eV. So, p c \u2248 50 MeV.\n\nTherefore, p \u2248 (50 MeV) / c.\n\nBut for the wave number k, we have k = p / \u0127.\n\nIn natural units where \u0127 = 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm (since \u0127c \u2248 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm), let me compute.\n\nSo, \u0127 = 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm / c.\n\nWait, because in natural units, c=1 and \u0127 is about 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm. So, p is in MeV/c. So, p = (50 MeV)/c.\n\nTherefore, k = p / \u0127 = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm/c) ) \u2192 the c cancels, so k = 50 / 197.33 fm^{-1}.\n\nCompute that: 50 / 197.33 \u2248 0.253 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should use the exact value of \u0127 in units. Let me make sure. The reduced Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of MeV\u00b7fm, where \u0127c \u2248 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm.\n\nSo, k = p / \u0127 = (p c) / (\u0127 c) ) \u2192 since p c is 50 MeV, and \u0127 c is 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm.\n\nSo, k = (50 MeV ) / (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm ) ) = 50 / 197.33 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2248 0.2532 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo, k \u2248 0.2532 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nNow, let's compute each term (2l+1) (sin \u03b4_l)^2 for l=0 to 4.\n\nLet's compute each one:\n\nl=0: 2l+1 = 1. \u03b40=90\u00b0, sin(90\u00b0)=1. So term is 1 * (1)^2 = 1.\n\nl=1: 2l+1=3. \u03b41=67\u00b0. sin(67) \u2248 0.9205. So term is 3*(0.9205)^2 \u2248 3*(0.847) \u2248 2.541.\n\nl=2: 2l+1=5. \u03b42=55\u00b0. sin(55) \u2248 0.8192. So term 5*(0.8192)^2 \u2248 5*(0.671) \u2248 3.355.\n\nl=3: 2l+1=7. \u03b43=30\u00b0. sin(30)=0.5. So term is 7*(0.5)^2 =7*(0.25)=1.75.\n\nl=4: 2l+1=9. \u03b44=13\u00b0. sin(13) \u2248 0.22495. Term is 9*(0.22495)^2 \u22489*(0.05) \u22480.45.\n\nNow sum all these terms:\n\n1 + 2.541 = 3.541\n\n3.541 +3.355=6.896\n\n6.896 +1.75=8.646\n\n8.646 +0.45\u22489.096.\n\nSo total sum is approximately 9.096.\n\nNow, Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * sum.\n\nWe have sum \u22489.096.\n\nSo Im f(0) = (9.096) / (2 * 0.2532 )\n\nCompute denominator: 2*0.2532=0.5064.\n\nSo Im f(0)= 9.096 / 0.5064 \u2248 17.95 fm.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are in the order of 177, 251, 355, etc. That's way larger than what I'm getting. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait a second. Oh wait! I think I forgot the factor of k. Let me double-check the formula.\n\nIm f(0) = [ (1/(2k)) ] * sum( (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4_l )\n\nWait, that's what I did. So, with k \u22480.2532 fm\u207b\u00b9,\n\n1/(2k) \u22481/(2 *0.2532) \u2248 1/0.5064 \u22481.975 fm.\n\nMultiply by sum 9.096: 1.975 *9.096 \u2248 17.95 fm.\n\nBut the options are in the hundreds. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nHmm. Let me go back and check each step.\n\nWait, when I computed k, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me recheck.\n\nThe electrons are 50 MeV. Their momentum p can be found from E = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m^2 c^4 ). So, p c = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 ) where E and m are in MeV.\n\nE=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.\n\nSo p c = sqrt(50^2 - (0.511)^2 ) \u2248 50 MeV.\n\nSo p = (50 MeV)/c. Then, since k = p / \u0127, and \u0127 c \u2248 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm, so \u0127 = (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm)/c.\n\nSo, k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm)/c ) ) = 50/(197.33) fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2248 0.2532 fm\u207b\u00b9. That seems correct.\n\nSo, Im f(0) = (sum) / (2k) = 9.096 / (2 *0.2532 ) = 9.096 / 0.5064 \u224817.95 fm.\n\nWait, but the options are in the hundreds. So I must have a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Another possibility is that the formula for Im f(0) is actually (sum of (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l) ) / (2k).\n\nWait, because I remember that in some cases, the imaginary part is related to sin(2\u03b4_l). Let me think again.\n\nWait, earlier I thought:\n\nIm f(0) = (1/(2k)) * sum ( (2l+1) (sin \u03b4_l)^2 )\n\nBut perhaps the correct formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l) ) / (4k).\n\nWait, let me think again. The optical theorem says that:\n\nIm f(0) = (k/(4\u03c0)) \u03c3_total\n\nAnd the total cross-section is given by:\n\n\u03c3_total = (4\u03c0/k\u00b2) sum [ (2l +1 ) sin(2 \u03b4_l) ]\n\nSo:\n\nIm f(0) = (k/(4\u03c0)) * (4\u03c0/k\u00b2) sum (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l) )\n\nSimplify:\n\nIm f(0) = [ (k) * (4\u03c0) ] / (4\u03c0 k\u00b2) ) ] * sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) )\n\nThe 4\u03c0 cancels, and k/(k\u00b2) is 1/k.\n\nSo,\n\nIm f(0) = sum ( (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l) ) / k\n\nHmm, that's different from before. So, I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nSo, with this correct formula, Im f(0) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l) ] / k\n\nSo, let's compute this.\n\nCompute sum for each l:\n\nl=0: 2l+1=1. \u03b40=90\u00b0, sin(2*90)=sin(180)=0. So term is 1*0=0.\n\nl=1: 2l+1=3. \u03b41=67\u00b0, 2\u03b4=134\u00b0. sin(134) \u2248 sin(46) \u2248 0.7193. So 3*0.7193 \u22482.1579.\n\nl=2: 2l+1=5. \u03b42=55\u00b0, 2\u03b4=110\u00b0. sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397. So 5*0.9397\u22484.6985.\n\nl=3: 2l+1=7. \u03b43=30\u00b0, 2\u03b4=60\u00b0. sin(60)=\u221a3/2\u22480.8660. 7*0.866\u22486.062.\n\nl=4: 2l+1=9. \u03b44=13\u00b0, 2\u03b4=26\u00b0. sin(26)\u22480.4384. 9*0.4384\u22483.9456.\n\nNow sum all these terms:\n\nl=0: 0\n\nl=1: 2.1579\n\nl=2: +4.6985 \u2192 6.8564\n\nl=3: +6.062 \u2192 12.9184\n\nl=4: +3.9456 \u2192 16.864.\n\nSo sum is approximately 16.864.\n\nNow, Im f(0) = 16.864 / k.\n\nk is about 0.2532 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo Im f(0) = 16.864 / 0.2532 \u2248 66.6 fm.\n\nWait, but the options given are in the hundreds. Hmm. The options are A)87163, B)355, C)177, D)251.\n\nWait, but wait! I might have messed up the units for k. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the wave number k is in units of inverse femtometers (fm\u207b\u00b9). But when I computed it, I got k \u22480.2532 fm\u207b\u00b9. So 1/k is approximately 3.95 fm.\n\nWait, but Im f(0) would be 16.864 / 0.2532 \u2192 approx 66.6 fm. But that's still not matching the options. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the total cross-section.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the formula for Im f(0) is (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) ) ].\n\nYes, that's what I think now, based on the optical theorem.\n\nSo, using that, with sum =16.864, and k=0.2532 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo Im f(0)=16.864 / 0.2532 \u224866.6 fm.\n\nBut the options are all in the hundreds. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recheck the sum.\n\nWait, let me recompute each term:\n\nl=0: 2l+1=1, \u03b4=90\u00b0, 2\u03b4=180\u00b0, sin(180)=0 \u2192 term 0.\n\nl=1: 3, \u03b4=67\u00b0 \u2192 2\u03b4=134\u00b0, sin(134)=sin(46)=0.7193 \u2192 3*0.7193=2.1579.\n\nl=2:5, \u03b4=55\u2192110\u00b0, sin(110)=0.9397 \u21925*0.9397\u22484.6985.\n\nl=3:7, 30\u219260, sin(60)=0.8660 \u21927*0.866\u22486.062.\n\nl=4:9, 13\u219226\u00b0, sin(26)=0.4384 \u21929*0.4384\u22483.9456.\n\nAdding them: 0 +2.1579\u22482.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864. So sum is correct.\n\nHmm, another possibility: perhaps I have a mistake in the units of k. Let's recompute k.\n\nWait, 50 MeV is the kinetic energy? No, the question says 50 MeV electrons. So E=50 MeV, which is the total energy. So p c= sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) \u2248 50 MeV.\n\nSo p=50 MeV/(c). Now, k = p / \u0127. But \u0127 c=197.33 MeV fm.\n\nSo, k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) \u2192 the c's cancel, so k =50/(197.33) fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 approx 0.2532 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So Im f(0)=16.864 /0.2532\u224866.6 fm. But the options are much higher.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I forgot that the electrons have charge, so maybe the scattering amplitude is different? Or perhaps the formula I'm using is for nucleons and not electrons, but I don't think that affects the formula.\n\nWait, what's the correct relation for Im f(0)? Another source I recall says that Im f(0) = (k/(4\u03c0)) \u03c3_total, and \u03c3_total is given by (4\u03c0/k\u00b2) sum (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l).\n\nSo, substituting, Im f(0) = (k/(4\u03c0)) * (4\u03c0/k\u00b2) sum (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l) ) \u2192 Im f(0) = sum/(k).\n\nYes, as before.\n\nSo, Im f(0) = 16.864 / 0.2532 \u224866.6 fm.\n\nBut none of the options are around 66. The closest option is C)177.675, which is roughly 2.66 times 66.6. Hmm, but that's not a clear multiple. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute k in inverse meters instead of inverse femtometers? No, that can't be. Because if k is in inverse meters, the units would be way off. Because 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1 fm\u207b\u00b9 is 1e15 m\u207b\u00b9. But scattering amplitudes are typically measured in femtometers, so k should be in fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. The problem states to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I only consider l=0 to 4, which I did.\n\nWait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians? Wait, no, the problem gives them in degrees. So I converted correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate each sin(2\u03b4_l) more accurately.\n\nLet me recompute each term with more precise sin values.\n\nl=0: 90\u00b0, sin(180)=0 \u2192 term 0.\n\nl=1: 67\u00b0 \u2192 2\u03b4=134\u00b0. sin(134\u00b0)=sin(180\u221246)=sin(46)\u22480.71934.\n\nSo 3 *0.71934=2.1580.\n\nl=2:55\u00b0\u2192110\u00b0, sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9396926.\n\n5 *0.9396926=4.698463.\n\nl=3:30\u219260\u00b0, sin(60)=\u221a3/2\u22480.8660254.\n\n7 *0.8660254=6.062178.\n\nl=4:13\u219226\u00b0, sin(26)=0.43837115.\n\n9 *0.43837115=3.94534035.\n\nSumming these:\n\n2.1580 +4.698463 =6.856463\n\n+6.062178 \u2192 12.918641\n\n+3.94534035 \u219216.863981.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, Im f(0)=16.863981 / 0.2532 \u2192 66.6 fm.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA)87163.4 fm\n\nB)355.351 fm\n\nC)177.675 fm\n\nD)251.271 fm.\n\nHmm, none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the formula is sum (2l+1) sin^2 \u03b4_l, not sin(2 \u03b4_l). Let me try that.\n\nWait, according to the first approach, where Im f(0)= [sum (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4_l ] / (2k )\n\nsum was 9.096, 2k=0.5064 \u2192 9.096 /0.5064\u224817.95 fm.\n\nBut again, the options are much higher.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is considering more terms, but the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4, so I think I did that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should include the factor of 4\u03c0 somewhere? Let me think.\n\nWait, in the optical theorem, Im f(0) is (k/(4\u03c0)) \u03c3_total.\n\n\u03c3_total is given by (4\u03c0/k\u00b2) sum (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l) )\n\nSo,\n\nIm f(0) = (k/(4\u03c0)) * (4\u03c0/k\u00b2) sum (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l) )\n\n= sum (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l) / k.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier. So, the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps in the problem statement, the phase shifts are given as \u03b40=90\u00b0, but in reality, the first phase shift is for l=0, which is for s-wave. So it's 90\u00b0, which is \u03c0/2 radians.\n\nWait, but I think that's correctly handled in the calculation.\n\nHmm. Another thought: Maybe the formula for Im f(0) is (sum (2l+1) sin(\u03b4_l) ) / k. But that would give a different result.\n\nWait, if I do that, then:\n\nsum = (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l for each l.\n\nl=0: (1) sin90=1 \u21921.\n\nl=1:3 sin67\u22483*(0.9205)=2.7615.\n\nl=2:5 sin55\u22485*(0.8192)=4.096.\n\nl=3:7 sin30=7*(0.5)=3.5.\n\nl=4:9 sin13\u22489*(0.22495)=2.02455.\n\nsum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.024Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electron scattering, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says that we have measured phase shifts \u03b4\u2080=90\u00b0, \u03b4\u2081=67\u00b0, \u03b4\u2082=55\u00b0, \u03b4\u2083=30\u00b0, and \u03b4\u2084=13\u00b0. The electrons are 50 MeV and are elastically scattered from a nuclear target. We're supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond these. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A, B, C, D.\n\nHmm. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. The general formula for the scattering amplitude f(\u03b8) is a sum over all the partial waves. Each term involves the spherical harmonics or something like that. But wait, along the incident direction, \u03b8=0\u00b0, right? So we're looking at forward scattering.\n\nWait, what's the formula for the scattering amplitude in the partial wave expansion? Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(\u03b8, \u03c6) can be written as a sum over l of (2l+1) (something involving the phase shifts). But wait, no, more precisely, the amplitude is given by:\n\nf(\u03b8) = \u2211\u2097 ( (2l + 1) * exp(i\u03b4\u2097) * sin(\u03b4\u2097) / (k * r) ) * something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think. Oh wait, the scattering amplitude f(\u03b8) is given by:\n\nf(\u03b8) = 4\u03c0 \u2211\u2097 ( (2l + 1) (sin \u03b4\u2097) / (2ik) ) * P\u2097(cos\u03b8) )\n\nWhere P\u2097 is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Alternatively, I think the general expression is:\n\nf(\u03b8) = (1/k) \u2211\u2097 ( (2l + 1) (e^{2i\u03b4\u2097} - 1) / (2i) ) P\u2097(cos\u03b8) )\n\nWait, but wait, what is the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at \u03b8=0\u00b0? Because the question asks for that.\n\nSo, the imaginary part would be the imaginary component of f(\u03b8) evaluated at \u03b8=0.\n\nBut wait, another approach I remember is that the differential cross-section in the Born approximation involves the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. The differential cross-section d\u03c3/d\u03a9 is proportional to |f|\u00b2, but for the imaginary part, perhaps we can use some relation.\n\nAlternatively, I think that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at \u03b8=0 is given by the sum over l of (2l +1) sin \u03b4\u2097 multiplied by something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should recall that the scattering amplitude at \u03b8=0 is given by f(0) = (1/k) \u2211\u2097 ( (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097 ) * something. Oh wait, because P_l(1) is 1 for all l, since P_l(1) = 1. So at \u03b8=0, cos\u03b8=1, so each P_l(cos\u03b8)=1.\n\nSo f(0) would be (1/k) \u2211\u2097 ( (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097 ). Because the exponential terms would contribute. Wait, let me get the exact formula.\n\nWait, the general formula for f(\u03b8) is f(\u03b8) = (1/k) \u2211\u2097 ( (2l + 1) e^{2i\u03b4\u2097} sin \u03b4\u2097 ) P\u2097(cos\u03b8) )\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The scattering amplitude is given by:\n\nf(\u03b8) = (1/k) \u2211\u2097 ( (2l + 1) [ e^{2i\u03b4\u2097} - 1 ] / (2i) ) P\u2097(cos\u03b8) )\n\nWait, that would make sense because when you expand e^{2i\u03b4\u2097}, you get cos(2\u03b4\u2097) + i sin(2\u03b4\u2097), so when you subtract 1 and divide by 2i, it becomes something like [ (cos(2\u03b4) - 1) + i sin(2\u03b4) ) ]/(2i) )\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated than needed. Alternatively, another approach: the scattering amplitude can be written in terms of partial waves. Each partial wave contributes a term, and the total amplitude is the sum of these terms. \n\nThe amplitude for each partial wave l is given by:\n\nf_l = ( (2l +1) (e^{2i\u03b4\u2097} - 1) ) / ( 2ik )\n\nSo the total amplitude f(\u03b8) is the sum over l of f_l multiplied by... Wait, no, because each term involves the spherical harmonics or Legendre polynomials.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that when calculating the forward scattering amplitude, \u03b8=0\u00b0, the expression simplifies because the Legendre polynomials P_l(cos 0) = 1 for all l. So f(0) is the sum over l of [ (2l + 1) (e^{2i\u03b4\u2097} - 1) ] / (2ik) multiplied by 1.\n\nWait, but what exactly is the formula? Let me think, perhaps f(\u03b8) = (1/k) \u2211_{l=0}^{\u221e} (2l +1) (sin \u03b4\u2097) e^{i \u03b4\u2097} P_l(cos\u03b8) )\n\nWait, because e^{i \u03b4\u2097} would be cos \u03b4\u2097 + i sin \u03b4\u2097. So for each term, we have (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097 (cos \u03b4\u2097 + i sin \u03b4\u2097) P_l(cos\u03b8) / k.\n\nAt \u03b8=0, P_l(1)=1. So each term becomes (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097 (cos \u03b4\u2097 + i sin \u03b4\u2097) /k.\n\nThe imaginary part of f(0) would then be the sum over l of (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097 sin \u03b4\u2097 divided by k. Because in the term (cos \u03b4\u2097 + i sin \u03b4\u2097), the imaginary part is sin \u03b4\u2097, multiplied by sin \u03b4\u2097 from the other part, so (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097 /k.\n\nWait, wait, let me clarify. The term is (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097 * (cos \u03b4\u2097 + i sin \u03b4\u2097) /k. So when you take the imaginary part, you're taking the i multiplied by sin \u03b4\u2097. So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097 * sin \u03b4\u2097 /k.\n\nSo the total imaginary part Im[f(0)] is the sum over l of (2l+1) (sin \u03b4\u2097)^2 / k.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097 multiplied by the real part of e^{i \u03b4\u2097}, which is cos \u03b4\u2097, but no, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I should think about the individual components.\n\nAnother approach: the scattering amplitude f(\u03b8) can be written as the sum over l of [ (2l+1) (e^{2i\u03b4\u2097} - 1)/(2ik) ) P_l(cos\u03b8) ]\n\nWait, another formula I think I remember is:\n\nf(\u03b8) = sum_{l=0}^\u221e ( (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4\u2097} - (2l+1) )/( 2ik ) P_l(cos\u03b8)\n\nWait, perhaps that's correct. Let's see: because e^{2i\u03b4\u2097} = 1 + 2i sin \u03b4\u2097 - (sin \u03b4\u2097)^2 etc., but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, let's take that formula:\n\nf(\u03b8) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\u221e (2l+1)(e^{2i\u03b4\u2097} - 1) P_l(cos\u03b8)\n\nSo for \u03b8=0, P_l(1)=1 for all l. So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(e^{2i\u03b4\u2097} -1 )\n\nNow, e^{2i\u03b4\u2097} -1 = e^{i\u03b4\u2097} ( e^{i\u03b4\u2097} - e^{-i\u03b4\u2097} ) = 2i e^{i\u03b4\u2097} sin \u03b4\u2097.\n\nWait, let's compute e^{2i\u03b4} -1 = e^{i\u03b4} (e^{i\u03b4} - e^{-i\u03b4}) ) = e^{i\u03b4} (2i sin \u03b4)\n\nSo substituting back into f(0):\n\nf(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) * (2i e^{i\u03b4} sin \u03b4) )\n\nBecause e^{2i\u03b4} -1 = 2i e^{i\u03b4} sin \u03b4.\n\nSo substitute:\n\nf(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1) * 2i e^{i\u03b4} sin \u03b4 ]\n\nSimplify the coefficients:\n\n2i/(2ik) = 1/(k)\n\nSo f(0) = sum [ (2l+1) e^{i\u03b4} sin \u03b4 ] /k.\n\nBut e^{i\u03b4} = cos \u03b4 + i sin \u03b4.\n\nSo each term becomes (2l+1) (cos \u03b4 + i sin \u03b4) sin \u03b4 /k.\n\nMultiply that out:\n\n(2l+1) [ cos \u03b4 sin \u03b4 + i sin\u00b2 \u03b4 ] /k.\n\nSo the imaginary part of f(0) is the sum over l of (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097 /k.\n\nAh, that's the same result as before. So Im[f(0)] = (sum (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097 ) /k.\n\nBut wait, what is k? Oh, k is the wave number of the electrons.\n\nThe electrons have energy 50 MeV. So I need to compute k in units of 1/fm, perhaps.\n\nWait, the formula for the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/(\u0127). But since we'll probably be using atomic units where \u0127 = 1 and m is the electron mass, but I need to compute it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the relation between the Debye length or using the relation for scattering in terms of wavelength.\n\nWait, the electrons have kinetic energy E=50 MeV. The mass of the electron is m_e = 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2. So the total energy is E = 50 MeV, so the kinetic energy is 50 MeV, but wait, that's only if it's a non-relativistic case, but 50 MeV is much larger than m_e c\u00b2 (~0.511 MeV), so relativistic effects are significant. Hmm, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, a simple approximation is used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relativistic formula for the momentum, which is p = sqrt( 2 m_e c\u00b2 E ), where E is the kinetic energy.\n\nWait no, wait. The total energy E_total is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But in high-energy cases, E_total \u2248 pc, because for relativistic particles, E \u2248 pc.\n\nSo for E_total = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV \u2248 50 MeV. So pc \u2248 50 MeV \u2192 p = 50 MeV/c.\n\nThen the momentum p = 50 MeV/c.\n\nBut since k = p/\u0127, but in units where \u0127 = 197.33 MeV fm (since \u0127c \u2248 197.33 MeV fm), so p in MeV/c \u2192 k = p/(\u0127 c) * \u0127 c \u2192 wait, perhaps I should compute k in 1/fm.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me compute k in terms of p.\n\nk = p/\u0127. But p is in units of MeV/c, and \u0127 is in units of MeV s. So to get k in 1/fm, perhaps I need to use the relation correctly.\n\nAlternatively, using natural units where \u0127 = c = 1.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute k in terms of the momentum.\n\nThe momentum p can be expressed as sqrt(2mE), but that's non-relativistic. For high energies, it's better to use the relativistic formula.\n\nWait, the electron's energy E is 50 MeV. The rest mass energy is 0.511 MeV, so E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2 = 50 MeV.\n\nSo \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) ) = 50 / 0.511 \u2248 97.83.\n\nThe momentum p is \u03b3 m v. Since v \u2248 c for relativistic speeds, p \u2248 \u03b3 m c.\n\nSo p = \u03b3 m c.\n\nBut m c is 0.511 MeV / c\u00b2 * c = 0.511 MeV / (c). Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the units.\n\nAlternatively, in natural units (\u0127 = c = 1), the momentum p is E (since E = pc).\n\nSo, p = E = 50 MeV.\n\nBut then, in natural units, the wave number k is p/(\u0127) \u2192 but since \u0127 = 1 in natural units, k = p = 50 MeV.\n\nBut wait, that's in natural units. To convert k into 1/fm, perhaps I need to relate MeV^{-1} to fm.\n\nWait, 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. The reduced Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. So 1 fm is \u0127 / (197.33 MeV) \u2248 1.015e-3 fm per 1/MeV.\n\nWait, no, more precisely, 1/(MeV) in units of distance is \u0127 c / (MeV). Wait, perhaps I should compute k in terms of inverse meters and then convert to fm^{-1}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute k as:\n\nk = p / \u0127\n\np is in MeV/c, and \u0127 is in MeV s.\n\nBut units can get tricky. Let me try to compute it numerically.\n\nFirst, compute p. Since E = 50 MeV, and using relativistic relation E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nSo p c = sqrt( E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nE = 50 MeV, m c\u00b2 = 0.511 MeV.\n\nSo p c = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) MeV \u2248 sqrt(2500) MeV = 50 MeV.\n\nSo p = (50 MeV) / c.\n\nNow, \u0127 is approximately 197.33 MeV fm (since \u0127 c \u2248 197.33 MeV fm). So:\n\nk = p / \u0127 = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) * (fm) / c )\n\nWait, units are a bit messy. Let's compute in terms of units where \u0127 c = 197.33 MeV fm.\n\nk = (p c) / (\u0127 c^2 )\n\nWait, perhaps better to write \u0127 = 197.33 MeV fm / c.\n\nSo p is (50 MeV)/(c). So \u0127 has units of (MeV fm)/c.\n\nSo k = p / \u0127 = [ (50 MeV/c) ] / [ (197.33 MeV fm/c) ) ] = (50)/(197.33) * (1 fm) )^{-1}.\n\nSo k \u2248 50 / 197.33 \u2192 approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.\n\nWait, because 50 / 197.33 \u2248 0.253.\n\nSo k \u2248 0.253 fm^{-1}.\n\nNow, going back, Im[f(0)] = sum (2l +1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097 / k.\n\nBut wait, the sum is over the phase shifts given. The problem says to ignore the rest, so l=0 to 4.\n\nSo l=0: \u03b4\u2080=90\u00b0, which is \u03c0/2 radians.\n\nWait, but for l=0, the phase shift \u03b4\u2080 is 90 degrees, so sin \u03b4\u2080=1.\n\nl=0: (2*0+1) = 1.\n\nsin\u00b2 90\u00b0 = 1.\n\nSo term is 1 *1 = 1.\n\nl=1: \u03b4\u2081=67\u00b0, sin(67) \u2248 0.9205. Squared is \u2248 0.8473.\n\nSo (2*1+1)=3 \u2192 3 * 0.8473 \u2248 2.5418.\n\nl=2: \u03b4\u2082=55\u00b0, sin(55)\u22480.8192 \u2192 0.8192^2\u22480.6710.\n\n(2*2+1)=5 \u2192 5 * 0.6710 \u2248 3.355.\n\nl=3: \u03b4\u2083=30\u00b0, sin(30)=0.5 \u2192 0.25.\n\n(2*3+1)=7 \u2192 7 * 0.25 = 1.75.\n\nl=4: \u03b4\u2084=13\u00b0, sin(13) \u2248 0.22495 \u2192 (0.22495)^2 \u2248 0.0506.\n\n(2*4+1)=9 \u2192 9*0.0506\u22480.4554.\n\nNow, sum all these terms:\n\nl=0: 1 \u2192 1\n\nl=1: ~2.5418 \u2192 total so far 3.5418\n\nl=2: ~3.355 \u2192 total 6.8968\n\nl=3: 1.75 \u2192 total 8.6468\n\nl=4: 0.4554 \u2192 total\u22489.1022.\n\nNow, Im[f(0)] = sum / k \u2192 9.1022 / 0.253 fm^{-1}.\n\nCompute this: 9.1022 / 0.253 \u2248 35.97 fm.\n\nWait, but wait. The options are around 177, 355, 251, etc. So 35 is way smaller than the options. Hmm, that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, perhaps I messed up the expression for Im[f(0)]. Let me double-check.\n\nEarlier, I thought Im[f(0)] = sum (2l+1) (sin \u03b4\u2097)^2 /k.\n\nBut let me re-derive it properly.\n\nWe have f(0) = sum [ (2l+1) (e^{i \u03b4\u2097} sin \u03b4\u2097) ] /k.\n\nBecause e^{2i \u03b4\u2097} -1 = 2i e^{i \u03b4\u2097} sin \u03b4\u2097.\n\nSo f(0) = [1/(2ik)] * sum (2l+1) * 2i e^{i \u03b4} sin \u03b4.\n\nThe 2i and denominator 2ik cancel out, leaving sum (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4} sin \u03b4 /k.\n\nSo each term is (2l+1) (cos \u03b4 + i sin \u03b4) sin \u03b4 /k.\n\nThe imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) (sin \u03b4)^2 /k.\n\nSo summing over l, Im[f(0)] = [sum (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097 ] /k.\n\nHmm, so the calculation seems correct. So the sum gives approximately 9.1022, and k is 0.253 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo 9.1022 / 0.253 \u2248 35.97 fm.\n\nWait, but the options are in hundreds of fm, like option C is 177 fm, B is 355, etc. So my calculation is getting about 36 fm, which isn't among the options. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me double-check that.\n\nHmm. Let's recompute k.\n\nE = 50 MeV. The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nSo p c = sqrt( E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nE is 50 MeV, m c\u00b2 is 0.511 MeV.\n\np c = sqrt(50\u00b2 - 0.511^2) \u2248 50 MeV.\n\nSo p = 50 MeV/c.\n\nk is given by p/(\u0127), where \u0127 \u2248 197.33 MeV fm /c.\n\nSo, k = p/(\u0127) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm /c ) ) = 50/(197.33) * (1 fm)^(-1) \u2248 0.253 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nHmm. But according to the calculation, Im[f(0)] is about 36 fm. But the options are much larger.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a factor. Let me think about the formula again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is multiplied by (2l+1) instead of being divided by k. Or perhaps the formula has a different factor.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I forgot to account for the 4\u03c0 factor or something else in the scattering amplitude. Let me think about the exact expression.\n\nThe scattering amplitude f(\u03b8) is given by:\n\nf(\u03b8) = 4\u03c0 sum_l [ ( (2l+1) / (2ik) ) (e^{2i\u03b4\u2097} -1) P_l(cos\u03b8) ]\n\nSo for \u03b8=0, P_l(1)=1.\n\nSo f(0)=4\u03c0/(2ik) sum_l (2l+1)(e^{2i\u03b4} -1 )\n\nAs before.\n\nWhich gives us f(0) = [4\u03c0/(2ik)] * sum [ (2l+1)(e^{2i\u03b4} -1) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to [2\u03c0/(ik)] * sum [ ... ]\n\nWait, let me compute e^{2i\u03b4} -1 = 2i e^{i\u03b4} sin \u03b4.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nsum [ (2l+1) * 2i e^{i\u03b4} sin \u03b4 ]\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nf(0) = [2\u03c0/(ik)] * [2i sum ( (2l+1) e^{i\u03b4} sin \u03b4 ) ]\n\nThe 2i and i in denominator: 2i / i = 2.\n\nSo f(0) = [2\u03c0 * 2 /k ] * sum ( (2l+1) e^{i\u03b4} sin \u03b4 )\n\nSo f(0) = (4\u03c0/k ) * sum ( (2l+1) e^{i\u03b4} sin \u03b4 )\n\nWait, so the expression is different. So the imaginary part is:\n\nIm[f(0)] = (4\u03c0/k) * sum ( (2l+1) sin \u03b4 cos \u03b4 )\n\nWait, because e^{i\u03b4} = cos \u03b4 + i sin \u03b4, so Im part is (2l+1) sin \u03b4 * sin \u03b4.\n\nWait, no, because when you take the imaginary part of e^{i\u03b4} sin \u03b4, it's (sin \u03b4) * sin \u03b4, because e^{i\u03b4} is cos \u03b4 + i sin \u03b4.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-express this.\n\nf(0) = (4\u03c0/k) * sum [ (2l+1) e^{i\u03b4} sin \u03b4 ]\n\nSo each term is (2l+1) (cos \u03b4 + i sin \u03b4) sin \u03b4.\n\nSo the imaginary part is (4\u03c0/k) * sum [ (2l+1) sin^2 \u03b4 ]\n\nSo Im[f(0)] = (4\u03c0/k) * sum [ (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4 ]\n\nAh! So earlier, I forgot to include the 4\u03c0 factor. That's why my previous calculation was way off.\n\nSo the correct expression is Im[f(0)] = (4\u03c0/k) * sum [ (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097 ]\n\nWhich is [4\u03c0 sum (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097 ] / k.\n\nSo let's recalculate.\n\nCompute sum (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097.\n\nWe have:\n\nl=0: 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nl=1: 3 * sin\u00b2(67\u00b0) \u2192 3*(0.9205)^2 \u2248 3*0.8473=2.5418.\n\nl=2:5 * sin\u00b2(55\u00b0) \u21925*(0.8192)^2 \u22485*0.6710=3.355.\n\nl=3:7 * sin\u00b2(30\u00b0)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.\n\nl=4:9 * sin\u00b2(13\u00b0)=9*(0.22495)^2\u22489*0.0506\u22480.4554.\n\nAdding them up: 1 + 2.5418 = 3.5418; +3.355=6.8968; +1.75=8.6468; +0.4554=9.1022.\n\nSo sum is approximately 9.1022.\n\nNow, multiply by 4\u03c0 \u2192 9.1022 * 4 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.1022 * 12.566 \u2248 let's compute.\n\n9 *12.566=113.094, 0.1022*12.566\u22481.285 \u2192 total \u2248 114.379.\n\nThen, divide by k=0.253 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo (114.379) / 0.253 \u2248 451.5 fm.\n\nWait, that's about 451 fm. But the options are:\n\nA) 87163.4 fm\n\nB) 355.351 fm\n\nC) 177.675 fm\n\nD) 251.271 fm.\n\nHmm, 451 is close to option B (355) or D (251), but not exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing 4\u03c0 * sum.\n\nLet me recompute 4\u03c0 times 9.1022.\n\n4\u03c0 \u2248 12.56637.\n\n12.56637 *9.1022 \u2248 let's compute.\n\n12.56637 *9=113.09733.\n\n12.56637 *0.1022\u22481.285.\n\nSo total \u2248 113.09733 + 1.285 = 114.3823.\n\nThen divide by k=0.253 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\n114.3823 / 0.253 \u2248 451.5 fm.\n\nHmm, but none of the options match. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, earlier I said k = p / \u0127 = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c) ) \u2192 50/(197.33) \u22480.253 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have used the non-relativistic formula for k, but the problem says 50 MeV electrons, which are highly relativistic.\n\nWait, let's think about the non-relativistic case.\n\nIn non-relativistic case, E = p\u00b2/(2m). So p = sqrt(2mE).\n\nm is the mass of the electron, which is 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo E =50 MeV \u2192 p = sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2 *50 MeV) \u2192 (2 * 0.511 *50 )^(1/2) MeV/c.\n\nWait, but units are tricky here. Let me compute it numerically.\n\np\u00b2 = 2 * m_e * E \u2192 m_e =0.511 MeV/c\u00b2, E=50 MeV.\n\nSo p\u00b2 = 2 *0.511 *50 = 51.1 MeV\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u2192 p= sqrt(51.1) MeV/c \u22487.15 MeV/c.\n\nThen, k = p/\u0127 = (7.15 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm/c) )= 7.15/(197.33) \u22480.0362 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nHmm, that's a very small k. Then, Im[f(0)] would be (4\u03c0/k) * sum... which would be much larger.\n\nWait, but in the non-relativistic case, the momentum would be much smaller, so k would be smaller, leading to a larger Im[f(0)]. So let's compute with this.\n\nsum is 9.1022.\n\n4\u03c0 *9.1022\u2248114.382.\n\nk=0.0362 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nIm[f(0)] = 114.382 / 0.0362 \u22483159 fm.\n\nBut that's way larger than the options. So that can't be right either.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the earlier approach where we took the relativistic k is correct, but the Im[f(0)] was around 451 fm, which isn't matching any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual formula for Im[f(0)] is (sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097 ) /k.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that was the case, but when I included the 4\u03c0 factor, it changed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-derive the formula correctly.\n\nThe correct expression for the scattering amplitude is:\n\nf(\u03b8) = (4\u03c0/k) sum_{l=0}^\u221e ( (2l+1) (sin \u03b4\u2097) e^{i \u03b4\u2097} ) P_l(cos\u03b8) )\n\nThus, when \u03b8=0, P_l(1)=1.\n\nSo f(0) = (4\u03c0/k) sum ( (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097 e^{i \u03b4\u2097 } )\n\nThe imaginary part is Im[f(0)] = (4\u03c0/k) sum ( (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097 sin \u03b4\u2097 ) = (4\u03c0/k) sum ( (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097 )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo with that, the sum is 9.1022.\n\n4\u03c0 *9.1022 \u2248114.382.\n\nDivided by k=0.253 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\n114.382 / 0.253 \u2248451.5 fm.\n\nBut none of the options match that.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the units for k. Let me check that again.\n\nk = p / \u0127.\n\nBut if I use \u0127 in units of MeV s, and p in MeV/c, then perhaps the units are getting confused.\n\nWait, let me compute k in 1/fm.\n\nThe Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 197.33 MeV fm (since \u0127 c \u2248197.33 MeV fm).\n\nSo, \u0127 = 197.33 MeV fm.\n\np is in MeV/c. So let me compute k:\n\nk = p / \u0127 \u2192 (MeV/c) / (MeV fm) ) = (1/c ) * (1/fm) ) \u2192 but wait, units would be (MeV/c) / (MeV fm) ) = 1/(c fm).\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to use the formula k = p/(\u0127 c) * c \u2192 wait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, since \u0127 c = 197.33 MeV fm,\n\np c =50 MeV \u2192 p =50 MeV/c.\n\nSo k = p/(\u0127) = (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm ) ) \u2192 50/(197.33) * (1/(MeV/c * MeV fm )) \u2192 Wait, units are getting messy. Let me think numerically.\n\nk = p / \u0127 = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) = (50)/(197.33) * 1/(fm) \u2192 0.253 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the answer isn't among the options. But that can't be the case because the options are provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.\n\nLet me recalculate the sum.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nl=0: 1 * sin\u00b290 = 1*1=1 \u2192 term=1.\n\nl=1:3 * sin\u00b267. Let me compute sin67\u00b0. 67 degrees: sin(67)= approx 0.9205.\n\nSo 0.9205^2=0.8473. 3*0.8473=2.5419.\n\nl=2:5 * sin\u00b255. sin55\u22480.8192. 0.8192^2=0.6710. 5*0.6710=3.355.\n\nl=3:7 * (0.5)^2 =7*0.25=1.75.\n\nl=4:9 * sin\u00b213. sin13\u22480.22495. 0.22495^2=0.0506. 9*0.0506\u22480.4554.\n\nSum: 1 + 2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.\n\nSo the sum is 9.1023.\n\nHmm, that's correct.\n\nSo Im[f(0)] = (4\u03c0 *9.1023) / 0.253.\n\nComputing 4\u03c0 *9.1023: 12.56637 *9.1023\u2248 let's compute.\n\n12 *9.1023=109.2276.\n\n0.56637 *9.1023\u22485.165.\n\nTotal\u2248109.2276 +5.165\u2248114.392.\n\nNow, 114.392 / 0.253 \u2248 451.5 fm.\n\nHmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps the initial assumption about the formula is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the imaginary part is given by the sum of (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097, not sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097.\n\nWait, let me think again about the expression for Im[f(0)].\n\nEarlier, I thought Im[f(0)] = (4\u03c0/k) sum (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct approach is:\n\nf(0) = (4\u03c0/k) sum [ (2l+1) (e^{i\u03b4\u2097} sin \u03b4\u2097) ]\n\nThe imaginary part is (4\u03c0/k) sum [ (2l+1) (e^{i\u03b4\u2097} sin \u03b4\u2097) ].\n\nBut e^{i\u03b4\u2097} = cos \u03b4\u2097 +i sin \u03b4\u2097.\n\nSo when multiplied by sin \u03b4\u2097, we get cos \u03b4\u2097 sin \u03b4\u2097 + i sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097.\n\nThe imaginary part comes from the i sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097 term. So the imaginary part is (4\u03c0/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097 ].\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in the initial formula, perhaps the sum is (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097, not squared.\n\nWait, let's consider another possibility: perhaps the formula is Im[f(\u03b8)] = (sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097 ) * something.\n\nWait, let me think about the differential cross-section.\n\nThe differential cross-section d\u03c3/d\u03a9 is proportional to |f|^2.\n\nThe imaginary part of f contributes to the cross-section as 2 Im(f) Re(f).\n\nBut for forward scattering, maybe the real part is negligible, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not about the scattering amplitude itself, but about the imaginary part of the optical theorem or something else. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude multiplied by k, which would give a quantity in fm.\n\nWait, if Im[f(0)] = (4\u03c0/k) * sum (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097,\n\nMultiply both sides by k: Im[f(0)] *k =4\u03c0 sum (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute Im[f(0)] * k.\n\nWhich would be (4\u03c0) * sum (9.1023) \u2248 114.392.\n\nBut looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is roughly 3.11 times 114.392.\n\nWait, 114.392 * 3 \u2248 343, close to option B (355). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute k more accurately.\n\nEarlier, I approximated k as 0.253 fm\u207b\u00b9. Let me compute it more precisely.\n\nk = p/(\u0127) \u2192 p=50 MeV/c.\n\nBut \u0127 = 197.327 MeV fm.\n\nSo k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.327 MeV fm) ) = (50)/(197.327) * (1/(fm)).\n\n50 \u00f7 197.327 \u22480.2532 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo k\u22480.2532 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo (4\u03c0 *9.1023) / 0.2532 \u2192 114.392 / 0.2532 \u2192 approximately 451.5 fm.\n\nWait, but the options don't include this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. The question says 'ignore the rest of the phase shifts', which probably means that l=0 to 4 are considered, and higher l are zero.\n\nBut perhaps I should recheck the phase shifts.\n\nWait, the given phase shifts are \u03b4\u2080=90\u00b0, \u03b4\u2081=67\u00b0, \u03b4\u2082=55\u00b0, \u03b4\u2083=30\u00b0, \u03b4\u2084=13\u00b0. Are there any negative signs? No, the question doesn't specify, so I assume they're positive.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the formula for Im[f(0)] is (sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097) /k.\n\nWait, in that case, sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097.\n\nl=0:1 *1=1.\n\nl=1:3 * sin67\u22483*0.9205=2.7615.\n\nl=2:5 * sin55\u22485*0.8192=4.096.\n\nl=3:7 *0.5=3.5.\n\nl=4:9 *0.22495\u22482.02455.\n\nSum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455\u224813.382.\n\nIm[f(0)] = sum /k \u219213.382 /0.253\u224852.85 fm.\n\nStill not matching options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097, then multiplied by some factor like 4\u03c0/(ik), but not sure.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: recall that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section via the optical theorem:\n\nIm(f(0)) = (k/(4\u03c0)) * (d\u03c3/d\u03a9) evaluated at \u03b8=0.\n\nBut without knowing the cross-section, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler and only considers the first term (l=0) because higher terms may contribute less, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option B is 355.351 fm. Which is approximately 114.392 * (1/0.322) \u2192 114.392 /0.322 \u2248355.3.\n\nSo 0.322 would be the k value if 4\u03c0 * sum is 114.392, and 114.392/k=355.3 would imply k=114.392/355.3 \u22480.322 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation of k is 0.253 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nBut if I use k=0.322, what would that imply about p?\n\nk = p/(\u0127) \u2192 p= k * \u0127.\n\nIf k=0.322 fm\u207b\u00b9,\n\np =0.322 fm\u207b\u00b9 * 197.33 MeV fm \u2192 p \u224863.59 MeV/c.\n\nThen, E= (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 )^0.5 \u2192 (63.59^2 +0.511^2 )^0.5 \u2192 approx 63.59 MeV.\n\nBut the question states E=50 MeV. So that's inconsistent.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum. Let me recheck:\n\nsum (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097.\n\nl=0: 1 *1=1.\n\nl=1:3 * (sin67)^2 \u21923*(0.9205)^2= 3*0.8473=2.5419.\n\nl=2:5*(sin55)^2=5*(0.8192)^2=5*0.671=3.355.\n\nl=3:7*(0.5)^2=1.75.\n\nl=4:9*(sin13)^2=9*(0.22495)^2=9*0.0506\u22480.4554.\n\nSum: 1+2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4554=9.1023.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. My calculation leads to about 451 fm, but the options don't have that. Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the correct formula is (sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097) / (k), without the 4\u03c0 factor.\n\nIn that case, sum= 13.382, as before.\n\nk=0.253 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\n13.382 / 0.253 \u224852.85 fm. Still not matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should have a factor of 2 instead of 4\u03c0.\n\nIn that case, 2 * sum = 2*9.1023=18.2046.\n\n18.2046 * 4\u03c0/(k) \u2192 18.2046*12.566/0.253 \u2192 18.2046*49.6 \u2248 903. That's way too big.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097) multiplied by something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is (sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097) * (k/ (2m)) ), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part in units of inverse femtometers, and the correct answer is 451 fm, but none of the options match.\n\nWait, looking at the options again:\n\nA) 87163.4 fm \u2192 about 8e4 fm.\n\nB) 355.351 fm.\n\nC) 177.675 fm.\n\nD) 251.271 fm.\n\nHmm, option B is 355.35 fm, which is close to 451 if I have a mistake in the calculation of k.\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot that the wave number k is in units of 1/fm, but perhaps I should have used the inverse of the Compton wavelength?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have used the relation k = sqrt(8mE)/ (2\u0127) ), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: use the formula for the Compton wavelength.\n\nThe Compton wavelength \u03bb = 2\u03c0\u0127/(m c).\n\nBut I'm not sure how that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should recompute k using the relativistic relation.\n\nE = 50 MeV, m c\u00b2=0.511 MeV.\n\nThen, the total energy E = gamma m c\u00b2.\n\nSo, gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) )=50 /0.511 \u224897.83.\n\nThe momentum p = gamma m v.\n\nSince v \u2248 c for high gamma, p \u2248 gamma m c.\n\nm c = 0.511 MeV /c.\n\nSo p \u224897.83 * 0.511 MeV/c = (97.83 *0.511) MeV/c \u224850 MeV/c.\n\nWhich brings us back to p=50 MeV/c, so k=50/(197.33) \u22480.253 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is not provided, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Another possibility: perhaps the sum is over even l only, but the question doesn't suggest that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given in degrees, and I should convert them to radians. Wait, that could make a big difference.\n\nBecause in the formula, the sine function uses radians. So when I calculated sin(67\u00b0), I used degrees, but perhaps should have used radians.\n\nWait, that's a big mistake. Oh no! I forgot to convert degrees to radians.\n\nYes, that's probably where I went wrong. Let me recalculate everything with the correct approach: converting degrees to radians before taking sine.\n\nSo converting each \u03b4 to radians:\n\n\u03b4\u2080=90\u00b0 \u2192 \u03c0/2 radians \u22481.5708 rad.\n\n\u03b4\u2081=67\u00b0 \u219267 * \u03c0/180 \u22481.16937 rad.\n\n\u03b4\u2082=55\u00b0 \u219255 * \u03c0/180\u22480.95993 rad.\n\n\u03b4\u2083=30\u00b0 \u2192 \u03c0/6 \u22480.523599 rad.\n\n\u03b4\u2084=13\u00b0 \u219213 * \u03c0/180 \u22480.226893 rad.\n\nNow, compute sin(\u03b4) for each:\n\nl=0: sin(1.5708) = 1.\n\nl=1: sin(1.16937) \u22480.9165 \u2192 (0.9165)^2\u22480.840.\n\nl=2: sin(0.95993) \u22480.8171 \u2192 (0.8171)^2\u22480.6677.\n\nl=3: sin(0.523599)=0.5 \u21920.25.\n\nl=4: sin(0.226893)\u22480.2253 \u2192 (0.2253)^2\u22480.0507.\n\nNow, compute each term:\n\nl=0:1 *1 =1.\n\nl=1:3 *0.840 \u21922.52.\n\nl=2:5 *0.6677 \u21923.3385.\n\nl=3:7 *0.25 \u21921.75.\n\nl=4:9 *0.0507 \u21920.4563.\n\nSum:1 +2.52=3.52 +3.3385=6.8585 +1.75=8.6085 +0.4563=9.0648.\n\nSo sum is approximately 9.0648.\n\nNow, Im[f(0)] = (4\u03c0 * sum ) /k \u2192 (4\u03c0 *9.0648)/0.253.\n\nCompute 4\u03c0\u224812.56637.\n\n12.56637 *9.0648 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n12 *9.0648=108.7776\n\n0.56637 *9.0648\u22485.140.\n\nTotal\u2248108.7776 +5.140\u2248113.918.\n\nNow, 113.918 /0.253 \u2192 approximately 450.26 fm.\n\nHmm, still around 450 fm, which isn't an option. But wait, perhaps the sum should be (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097, not sin squared.

Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097) multiplied by 2.\n\nThen, Im[f(0)] =2 * sum /k \u2192 2 *13.3627 /0.253 \u219226.7254 /0.253 \u2248105.6 fm.\n\nStill not in options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097, multiplied by 1/k and 2\u03c0.\n\nSo 2\u03c0 *13.3627 /0.253 \u2192approx 83.80 /0.253 \u2192331.2 fm.\n\nCloser to option B (355.35) but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is (2l+1) * sin(2\u03b4\u2097).\n\nWait, but that's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for Im[f(0)] is (sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097 ) * (k) / (something).\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the sum as (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097, then multiply by 4\u03c0/(k).\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\nsum =13.3627.\n\n4\u03c0 *13.3627 = 12.56637 *13.3627 \u2248168.60.\n\nDivide by k=0.253 \u2192168.60/0.253\u2248666.3 fm.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is Im[f(0)] = (k/(4\u03c0)) sum (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097.\n\nBut that would give Im[f(0)] = (0.253/4\u03c0) *9.0648 \u2192 (0.253 /12.566) *9.0648 \u2192approx (0.0201) *9.0648\u22480.182 fm.\n\nThat's too small.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097) multiplied by something else, like 1/(k *2).\n\nWait, then sum=13.3627 \u219213.3627/(2 *0.253) \u219213.3627/0.506\u224826.42 fm.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097) multiplied by (1/k * 4\u03c0).\n\nWhich would be 13.3627 * (4\u03c0/0.253) \u219213.3627 * 50.3 \u2192approx 672.5 fm.\n\nNo, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is Im[f(0)] = sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4\u2097 * (something else).\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude in the Born approximation is f(\u03b8) = ( -2\u03c0/k ) ( (e^{2i\u03b4} -1) ) / (2i) ) \u2192 which simplifies to f = (\u03c0/k) sin(2\u03b4) \u2192 Im(f) = (\u03c0/k) sin(2\u03b4).\n\nBut that's only for l=0. So, but in reality, it's a sum over all l.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is considering only the dominant term, l=0. If so, then Im[f(0)] would be (\u03c0/k) sin(2\u03b4\u2080).\n\nFor l=0, \u03b4\u2080=90\u00b0 \u2192 sin(180\u00b0)=0.\n\nSo that would give Im[f(0)] =0, which doesn't match any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's l=1.\n\n\u03b4=67\u00b0, so sin(134\u00b0)=sin(46\u00b0)=approx 0.7193.\n\nIm[f] = (\u03c0/k) * 0.7193 \u2192 (3.1416/0.253) *0.7193 \u2192approx 12.417 *0.7193 \u22488.94 fm.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options. My earlier calculation with the correct conversion to radians gave Im[f(0)]\u2248450 fm, which is not an option. But option B is 355.35 fm. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.\n\nWait, let me recompute the sum with radians:\n\nsum (2l+1) sin\u00b2 \u03b4\u2097.\n\nl=0:1 * (sin(90\u00b0))^2=1*(1)^2=1.\n\nl=1:3*(sin(67\u00b0))^2=3*(0.9165)^2=3*0.840\u22482.52.\n\nl=2:5*(sin(55\u00b0))^2=5*(0.8171)^2=5*0.6677\u22483.3385.\n\nl=3:7*(0.5)^2=1.75.\n\nl=4:9*(sin13\u00b0)^2=9*(0.2253)^2=9*0.0507\u22480.4563.\n\nSum:1+2.52=3.52 +3.3385=6.8585 +1.75=8.6085 +0.4563=9.0648.\n\nSo sum is 9.0648.\n\n4\u03c0 *9.0648 \u2192 approx 113.918.\n\nDivided by k=0.253, gives 450.26 fm.\n\nBut perhaps the correct answer is option B, 355.35 fm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct value of k is 0.322 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nBecause 4\u03c0 * sum/k \u2192 113.918 /0.322 \u2248353.7 fm.\n\nWhich is close to option B (355.35 fm).\n\nSo perhaps k is 0.322 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nHow would that happen?\n\nIf k=0.322 fm\u207b\u00b9,\n\nthen p= k * \u0127 \u21920.322 *197.33 MeV fm \u224863.59 MeV fm.\n\nBut p is in MeV/c, so p=63.59 MeV/c.\n\nThen E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ) \u2192 (63.59^2 +0.511^2 )^0.5 \u2192approx63.59 MeV.\n\nBut the given E is 50 MeV. So that's inconsistent.\n\nHmm, unless the initial assumption about the energy being non-relativistic is incorrect, but earlier that led to even smaller k.\n\nI'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B) 355.35 fm.\n\n\nTo calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{4\\pi}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (2l+1) \\sin^2 \\delta_l\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is the wave number of the electrons, and the phase shifts \\(\\delta_l\\) are given for \\( l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\). The problem specifies to ignore higher-order phase shifts beyond \\( l = 4 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Compute the wave number \\( k \\)\nThe electrons have a kinetic energy of \\( 50 \\, \\text{MeV} \\). Using the relativistic relation for momentum:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2}}{c}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( E = 50 \\, \\text{MeV} \\) and \\( m c^2 = 0.511 \\, \\text{MeV} \\), we find:\n\n\\[\np \\approx 50 \\, \\text{MeV}/c\n\\]\n\nThe wave number \\( k \\) is related to \\( p \\) by:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{p}{\\hbar}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( \\hbar c \\approx 197.33 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm} \\), we calculate:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{50}{197.33} \\, \\text{fm}^{-1} \\approx 0.253 \\, \\text{fm}^{-1}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute the sum \\( \\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \\sin^2 \\delta_l \\)\nThe phase shifts are given as:\n- \\( \\delta_0 = 90^\\circ \\)\n- \\( \\delta_1 = 67^\\circ \\)\n- \\( \\delta_2 = 55^\\circ \\)\n- \\( \\delta_3 = 30^\\circ \\)\n- \\( \\delta_4 = 13^\\circ \\)\n\nConvert the phase shifts to radians:\n- \\( \\delta_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\, \\text{rad} \\)\n- \\( \\delta_1 \\approx 1.169 \\, \\text{rad} \\)\n- \\( \\delta_2 \\approx 0.959 \\, \\text{rad} \\)\n- \\( \\delta_3 \\approx 0.524 \\, \\text{rad} \\)\n- \\( \\delta_4 \\approx 0.227 \\, \\text{rad} \\)\n\nCompute \\( \\sin^2 \\delta_l \\) for each \\( l \\):\n- \\( \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\sin^2(67^\\circ) \\approx 0.840 \\)\n- \\( \\sin^2(55^\\circ) \\approx 0.668 \\)\n- \\( \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 0.25 \\)\n- \\( \\sin^2(13^\\circ) \\approx 0.051 \\)\n\nNow, calculate the weighted sum:\n\\[\n\\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \\sin^2 \\delta_l = 1(1) + 3(0.840) + 5(0.668) + 7(0.25) + 9(0.051)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 + 2.52 + 3.34 + 1.75 + 0.46 = 9.07\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute \\( \\text{Im}[f(0)] \\)\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{4\\pi}{k} \\cdot \\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \\sin^2 \\delta_l\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{4\\pi}{0.253} \\cdot 9.07\n\\]\n\nFirst, compute \\( 4\\pi \\approx 12.566 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\frac{12.566 \\cdot 9.07}{0.253} \\approx \\frac{114.0}{0.253} \\approx 450.2 \\, \\text{fm}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the options\nThe calculated value of \\( \\text{Im}[f(0)] \\approx 450.2 \\, \\text{fm} \\) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **B) 355.351 fm**, which suggests either a discrepancy in the problem setup or an approximation in the given options.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**B) 355.351 fm**",
