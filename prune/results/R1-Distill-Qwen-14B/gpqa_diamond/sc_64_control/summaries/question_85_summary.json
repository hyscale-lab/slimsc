      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully.\n\nAlright, the question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Both planets have been detected using transit and radial velocity methods. Interesting.\n\nPlanet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. \n\nNow, the question is about their equilibrium temperatures. And the options are given as A to D with certain ratios. So I need to find the ratio T1/T2.\n\nWait, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on several factors. The main formula I think is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. But wait, the albedo is the same for both planets, so that part cancels out in the ratio. So I can ignore albedo for this calculation.\n\nSo, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - a) )^0.25. Since albedo a is the same, when I take the ratio of T1 to T2, that term (1-a) will raise to the 0.25 power but since it's the same for both, it will cancel out. So the ratio will be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) times (T_star for both same, so that's 1). Hmm, wait wait, no. Wait, a is the orbital distance? No, a is the planet's semi-major axis, which is their orbital radius. So each planet has a different a. So the ratio would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1). Because the R_star terms and the 2 in the denominator would cancel.\n\nWait, let me write it out:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( (R_star) / (2a) )\n\nSo for Planet1, T1 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a1)), Planet2, T2 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a2)).\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) because R/(2a1) divided by R/(2a2) is (a2/a1).\n\nTherefore, I need to find the ratio a2/a1 to square root that to get the temperature ratio.\n\nBut wait, how do I get a1 and a2? I don't have the orbital distances directly. Oh, but the question gives me information about the RV shifts. Each planet causes a shift in the star's spectrum due to Doppler effect. The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which depends on the planet's mass and the orbital distance.\n\nWait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^0.5 ) ) ) * (1/(2\u03c0 G)) * ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(-1/3) * ... Wait, perhaps it's better to remember the approximate formula.\n\nAlternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) )\n\nBut since e is zero (they're circular orbits), the term (1 - e^2)^0.5 becomes 1. Also, since the planet mass is much less than the star, M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star. So M_planet is about (7 Earth masses) and the star is 1.5 solar masses. 1.5 solar masses is much larger than 7 Earth masses, so M_planet can be neglected. So the denominator is approximately M_star^(2/3).\n\nBut I'm not sure about this. Let me think again. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = [ (G * P ) / (2\u03c0 c^3) ) ]^(-1/3) * [ (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ]\n\nWait, no, another approach. Maybe using the simplified version for circular orbits (e=0) and when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (so M_planet << M_star), the RV semi-amplitude K is approximately:\n\nK \u2248 (v) = ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2\u03c0 G)) )/( something )\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the formula in terms of the orbital period and distance. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * a^(1/3) )\n\nWait, I think the correct formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / (2 \u03c0 a (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the formula I found elsewhere: the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p / M_J) ) * ( (P / yr) )^(-1/3) ) * ( (M_* / M_sun ) )^(-2/3) ) * ( 1 / sqrt(1 - e\u00b2) )\n\nBut since e=0, and M_p is in Jupiter masses, M_* in solar masses, P in years.\n\nWait, let me think. Alternatively, I can use the formula for K in terms of the semi-major axis a (in AU), period P (in years), and mass of the star M_* (in solar masses). But I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a relationship between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital distance a. The formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) * a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2\u03c0)) )^(-1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = [ (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( ( M_* + M_p )^(1/3) ) * ( (2\u03c0 a (1 - e\u00b2) )^(1/3) ) ) ]\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to find the formula again.\n\nThe correct formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = ( (G * P ) / (2\u03c0 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, that can't be right. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is:\n\nK = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / (2\u03c0 a (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) ) ) )^(1/3) )\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think differently. Maybe the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the star's mass to the 1/3 power and proportional to the planet's mass and the sine of the inclination. But since both planets are around the same star and the question probably assumes i=90 degrees (edge-on, which gives sin i=1), we can ignore that.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/(M_*^(2/3) a^(1/3)) * (1/(something)) ). But I'm not exactly sure, so perhaps another approach is better.\n\nWait, for a given star, the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period. But that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for circular orbits and M_p << M_*, K can be written as:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G * M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2\u03c0 a) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut perhaps I should think in terms of the measured Doppler shifts given in the problem. \n\nThe problem says that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line at 6300 \u00c5, and Planet2 induces a shift of 0.04 \u00c5. Wait, but wait, the forbidden line being at 6300 \u00c5 is probably a typo because the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5 is a permitted line, but perhaps that's not important. \n\nWait, the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5? Hmm, no, I think the [OI] triplet is around 6300 \u00c5, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the key point is that each planet induces a Doppler shift, which corresponds to K. The Doppler shift is measured in terms of wavelength shift, which relates to the velocity via the formula:\n\n\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c\n\nSo the velocity shift v = K is equal to (\u0394\u03bb) / \u03bb * c.\n\nGiven that \u0394\u03bb is the shift (0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1, 0.04 \u00c5 for Planet2), and \u03bb is the wavelength of the line, which is 6300 \u00c5.\n\nSo, K1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * c\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me compute K in m/s. \n\nThe formula is K = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c, where \u0394\u03bb is the shift, and \u03bb is the wavelength. c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo for Planet1, K1 = (0.03 \u00c5) / (6300 \u00c5) * c = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e8 m/s.\n\nWait, let's compute that. 0.03 /6300 = 0.0000047619 \u2248 4.7619e-6.\n\nSo K1 = 4.7619e-6 * 3e8 = 4.7619e2 = approximately 142.857 m/s.\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2, K2 = (0.04 /6300 ) *3e8 = (4e-5) *3e8 = 4e3 m/s? Wait, wait wait, no, let me compute 0.04/6300 = 0.0000063492 \u2248 6.3492e-6.\n\nSo K2 =6.3492e-6 *3e8 = 6.3492e2 \u2248 190.476 m/s.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check: 0.03 /6300 = 0.00000476190476... So 4.7619e-6. Multiply by 3e8 m/s: 4.7619e-6 *3e8 = 4.7619e2 = 142.857 m/s.\n\nSimilarly, 0.04 /6300 = 0.0000063492. So 6.3492e-6. Multiply by 3e8: 6.3492e2 \u2248 190.476 m/s.\n\nSo K1 is about 142.86 m/s, K2 is about 190.48 m/s.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if the shifts are given as absolute shifts or as velocities. Oh wait, the question says \"periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5\" which I think refers to the Doppler shift, so the velocity shift would be as calculated above.\n\nSo now I have K1 and K2. Now, I need to relate K to the orbital distance a.\n\nThe formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) * a^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (2\u03c0))^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for K from the radial velocity method. The formula is:\n\nK = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / (2\u03c0 a (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me look up the correct formula for K.\n\nThe correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2\u03c0)) )^(1/3) * ( (1 - e\u00b2) )^(-1/2) ) / (a^(1/3) )\n\nBut since e=0, the term (1 -e\u00b2)^-0.5 = 1.\n\nSo, K = [ ( G * M_p ) / ( M_* + M_p ) ]^(1/3) * [ 1/(2\u03c0 a) ]^(1/3 )\n\nBut given that M_p << M_*, this can be approximated as:\n\nK \u2248 ( ( G * M_p ) / ( M_* ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2\u03c0 a))^(1/3 )\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, another approach is to consider that for a given planet, the semi-amplitude K depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period.\n\nWait, I know that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (v0 ) ) = ( (G * M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * ( (1) ) / ( (a (1-e\u00b2) )^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut perhaps I can use the formula with P, the orbital period.\n\nWait, Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_*)/(4\u03c0\u00b2). So a^3 = G M_* P^2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2). So a = [ G M_* P^2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3 )\n\nBut I don't have P; I have K. So I need to relate K and a.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to express a in terms of K. Let's see.\n\nFrom the formula for K:\n\nK = (v) = (2 \u03c0 G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3) (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, I'm getting myself confused. Let's try to write K in terms of a.\n\nI think the correct formula is:\n\nK = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 \u03c0 ) )^(-1/3) * (1 / (a (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write a in terms of K.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the formula in terms of a. For the same star, if I have two planets, I can write the ratio K1/K2 in terms of their masses and a's.\n\nSo, K1/K2 = ( ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( a2 / a1 ) )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nBecause K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) * (a)^(-1/3).\n\nYes, because K \u221d (M_p)^(1/3) / (a)^(1/3).\n\nSo K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )\n\nSo (K1/K2) = [ (M_p1 a2 ) / ( M_p2 a1 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nBut wait, I have K1 and K2, so I can write this as:\n\nK1/K2 = [ ( (M_p1 a2 ) / ( M_p2 a1 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo I can solve for a2/a1.\n\nBecause I need a2 and a1 to compute the temperature ratio.\n\nSo let's compute K1 and K2. From earlier, K1 is about 142.86 m/s, K2 about 190.48 m/s.\n\nSo K1/K2 = 142.86 / 190.48 \u2248 0.75.\n\nNow, M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses.\n\nSo plugging into the equation:\n\n0.75 = [ (7 * a2) / (5 * a1) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nRaise both sides to the 3rd power:\n\n0.75^3 = (7 a2) / (5 a1 )\n\n0.75^3 is 0.421875.\n\nSo,\n\n0.421875 = (7 a2) / (5 a1 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 a1:\n\n0.421875 *5 a1 =7 a2 \u2192 2.109375 a1 =7 a2 \u2192 a2 = (2.109375/7) a1 \u2192 a2 \u2248 0.30134 a1.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because a2 is in the denominator for the temperature ratio, right?\n\nWait, earlier I had T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ), because T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a) ), so when taking the ratio, T1/T2 = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo if a2 is approximately 0.30134 a1, then a2/a1 \u2248 0.30134.\n\nSo sqrt(0.30134) is approximately 0.549, so T1/T2 \u2248 0.549. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because if a2 is smaller than a1, then Planet2 is closer to the star, so it should be hotter. So T2 > T1, which would mean T1/T2 < 1.\n\nWait, according to my calculation, a2 is about 0.3 a1. So a2 is smaller than a1, meaning Planet2 is closer. So T2 should be higher than T1, so T1/T2 <1.\n\nSo the ratio is about 0.55. Looking back at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close.\n\nWait, but let me re-examine the K ratio. Because I might have made a mistake in calculating K1 and K2.\n\nWait, the given shifts are 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5 for the same star line at 6300 \u00c5.\n\nSo K = (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) * c.\n\nSo for Planet1: K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c.\n\nSimilarly, K2 = (0.04 /6300) *c.\n\nAh, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of K.\n\nBecause 0.03 \u00c5 is 3e-8 meters, and 6300 \u00c5 is 6300e-10 meters. So when you compute K, it's (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * c.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\n0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03 /6300 = 3e-3 /6300 \u2192 3e-3 / 6.3e3 = 4.7619e-7.\n\nMultiply by c (3e8 m/s):\n\n4.7619e-7 *3e8 = 4.7619e2 \u2248 142.857 m/s. So that part is correct.\n\nSimilarly, K2 is (0.04 /6300) *3e8 = 0.04 /6300 = 4e-3 /6300 \u2192 4e-3 /6.3e3 \u2248 6.3492e-7.\n\nMultiply by 3e8: 6.3492e-7 *3e8 = 190.476 m/s.\n\nSo K1 is about 142.86 m/s, K2 is about 190.48 m/s.\n\nSo K1/K2 \u2248 142.86/190.48 \u2248 0.75.\n\nSo earlier calculation is correct.\n\nSo (K1/K2) = ( (M_p1 a2 )/(M_p2 a1) )^(1/3 )\n\nSo 0.75^3 = (7 a2 ) / (5 a1 )\n\n0.421875 = 7 a2/(5 a1 )\n\n\u2192 5 a1 * 0.421875 =7 a2\n\n\u2192 a2 = (5 * 0.421875 /7 ) a1 \u2192 5*0.421875 is about 2.109375, divided by 7 is about 0.30134 a1.\n\nSo a2 is 0.30134 a1.\n\nSo a2/a1 = 0.30134.\n\nNow, the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(0.30134) \u2248 0.549.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA) ~ 0.98\n\nB) ~ 1.30\n\nC) ~ 0.53\n\nD) ~1.05\n\nSo 0.549 is close to option C (~0.53). \n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )\n\nWait, is that right? Because I've read before that the equilibrium temperature for a planet is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Since albedo is same, the ratio is only sqrt( R/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R/(2a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nSo the ratio is sqrt( a2/a1 ) \u2192 0.549, which is about 0.55. So option C is 0.53, which is close.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I messed up the formula for K. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another formula I came across is:\n\nK = (v) = [ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) / (M_J) ) * (P / yr )^(-1/3) ) * ( (M_* / M_sun ) )^(-2/3) ) ] / ( sqrt(1 - e\u00b2) )\n\nBut since in this case e=0, and M_p is in Earth masses, perhaps I can adjust this formula.\n\nWait, but in the formula, M_p is in Jupiter masses, so I need to convert Planet1 and Planet2's masses from Earth masses to Jupiter masses.\n\nBecause 1 Jupiter mass is about 318 Earth masses. So Planet1 is 7 Earth masses \u21927/318 \u2248 0.022 J masses. Planet2 is 5/318 \u2248 0.0157 J masses.\n\nSo K1 = (27.4 m/s) * (0.022) * (P1)^(-1/3) * (1.5)^(-2/3) ) / sqrt(1 -e\u00b2 )\n\nBut since I don't have P, the period, perhaps this approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since both planets are around the same star, perhaps I can write the ratio K1/K2 in terms of (M_p1/M_p2) * (a2/a1 )^(1/3 ), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: For circular orbits, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = ( (2\u03c0 G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2 )^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3 )\n\nBut perhaps I can express the ratio K1/K2 as:\n\nK1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ) ] / [ ( (M_* + M_p1 ) / (M_* + M_p2 ) )^(1/3) ) ]\n\nBut since M_* is much larger than M_p1 and M_p2, M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, so it's approximately:\n\nK1/K2 \u2248 (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )\n\nBut without knowing the periods, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, using Kepler's third law, which says that P\u00b2 is proportional to a\u00b3/(M_* )\n\nSo P1\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a1\u00b3 )/(G M_* )\n\nSimilarly, P2\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a2\u00b3 )/(G M_* )\n\nTaking the ratio, P1\u00b2/P2\u00b2 = (a1\u00b3/a2\u00b3 )\n\nSo P1/P2 = (a1\u00b3/a2\u00b3 )^(1/2 ) = (a1/a2 )^(3/2 )\n\nSo (P2/P1 ) = (a2/a1 )^(3/2 )\n\nSo (P2/P1 )^(1/3 ) = (a2/a1 )^( (3/2) * (1/3) ) ) = (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )\n\nSo plugging back into the K ratio:\n\nK1/K2 \u2248 (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2 ) * sqrt(a2/a1 )\n\nBut we know K1/K2 = 0.75.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nBecause M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75 = (1.4) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nHmm, let's compute sqrt(a2/a1 ):\n\nsqrt(a2/a1 ) = 0.75 /1.4 \u2248 0.5357\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(a2/a1 ) \u2248 0.5357 \u2192 a2/a1 \u2248 (0.5357)^2 \u2248 0.287.\n\nWait, earlier I got a2/a1 \u2248 0.30134. So now, this approach gives a different value.\n\nBut which approach is correct?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach when I derived the relation between K and a. So now, I'm getting a different a2/a1 ratio.\n\nBut which formula is correct? Let me think.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered K as proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) * (a)^(-1/3), leading to (K1/K2) = [ (M_p1 a2)/(M_p2 a1) ]^(1/3 )\n\nIn the second approach, using Kepler's law, I arrived at K1/K2 \u2248 (M_p1/M_p2) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nWhich is correct?\n\nWait, I think the correct formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 \u03c0 a (1 - e\u00b2)) )^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nK = ( ( G M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2 \u03c0 a ) )^(1/3 )\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nK = [ ( M_p )/(M_* ) ) * (1/(2 \u03c0 a )) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nK \u221d ( M_p )^(1/3) * a^(-1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nK1/K2 = [ ( M_p1 a2 )/( M_p2 a1 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo that's what I did in the first approach.\n\nSo in that case, the first approach is correct, and the second approach was perhaps incorrect because I might have messed up the exponents.\n\nWait, in the second approach, I used the formula K \u221d (M_p) * sqrt(a), which doesn't seem correct. Because in the first approach, the proportionality is (M_p)^(1/3) * a^(-1/3).\n\nSo perhaps the first approach is correct, and the second approach was a mistake.\n\nSo, going back, the first approach gave me a2/a1 \u2248 0.30134, so T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) \u2248 0.549 \u2192 0.55.\n\nBut in the second approach, I thought K1/K2 is (M_p1/M_p2) * sqrt(a2/a1 ), which led to a2/a1 \u2248 0.287. But perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the correct formula. Let me use the correct formula.\n\nSo K \u221d (M_p)^(1/3) * (a)^(-1/3 )\n\nThus,\n\nK1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )\n\nBecause a is in the denominator, so a2/a1 is (a2/a1 ), so the exponent is positive.\n\nSo,\n\n( K1/K2 ) = [ ( M_p1 a2 ) / ( M_p2 a1 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\n(0.75) = [ (7 a2 ) / (5 a1 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nCubing both sides:\n\n0.421875 = (7 a2)/(5 a1 )\n\nSo,\n\n7 a2 = 0.421875 *5 a1 \u2192 7 a2 = 2.109375 a1 \u2192 a2 = (2.109375 /7 ) a1 \u2192 a2 \u2248 0.30134 a1.\n\nSo, a2/a1 = 0.30134, so T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( 0.30134 ) \u2248 0.549.\n\nSo, approximately 0.55.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close.\n\nBut why does the second approach give a different result? Because in the second approach, I might have made a mistake in the exponents. Let me see.\n\nIn the second approach, I wrote:\n\nK1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2 ) * (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )\n\nBut since P is related to a via Kepler's law, P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3 / M_*, so P \u221d a^(3/2 ) / M_*^(1/2 )\n\nWait, for two planets around the same star, M_* is same, so P \u221d a^(3/2 )\n\nSo, P2/P1 = (a2/a1 )^(3/2 )\n\nThen, (P2/P1 )^(1/3 ) = (a2/a1 )^( (3/2) * (1/3) ) = (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\nK1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )\n\nBut from the correct approach, K1/K2 = [ ( M_p1 a2 )/( M_p2 a1 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach to resolve this is to calculate the ratio from the first approach and see which gives the correct a2/a1.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because different formulas are used. Let me use the correct formula for K.\n\nThe correct formula is K \u221d (M_p)^(1/3) * a^(-1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = ( (M_p1)/(M_p2) )^(1/3 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )\n\nWhich simplifies to [ ( M_p1 a2 )/( M_p2 a1 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\n(0.75 ) = [ (7 a2 )/(5 a1 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nCubing,\n\n0.421875 = (7 a2 )/(5 a1 )\n\n\u2192 7 a2 = 5 a1 * 0.421875 \u2192 7 a2 = 2.109375 a1 \u2192 a2 = (2.109375 /7 ) a1 \u2192 a2 \u2248 0.30134 a1.\n\nSo, a2/a1 = 0.30134.\n\nThus, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1 ) \u2248 sqrt(0.30134 ) \u2248 0.549.\n\nSo, approximately 0.55.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) ~0.98 \u2192 0.98 is close to 1. Hmm, but that's not the case as a2 is smaller than a1.\n\nB) ~1.30 \u2192 higher than 1. Our calculation is below 1.\n\nC) ~0.53 \u2192 close to our 0.55.\n\nD) ~1.05 \u2192 near 1, but higher.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be around 0.55, so option C is 0.53, which is very close.\n\nWait, but the options are approximate. So 0.55 is about 0.53 when considering rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my calculations are slightly off due to approximations.\n\nWait, let me recompute with more precise numbers.\n\na2 = (0.421875 *5 a1 ) /7 \u2192 0.421875 *5 is 2.109375 \u2192 2.109375 /7 = 0.30134 a1.\n\nSo a2/a1 = 0.30134.\n\nsqrt(0.30134 ) = sqrt(0.30134 ) = approximately 0.549.\n\nSo why is option C 0.53?\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the K calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, another thought: Doppler shift is given as a shift of 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5. But perhaps the shifts are in the same direction, leading to the same orbital velocity. Or perhaps the shifts are given in a different way. Wait, the forbidden line is at 6300 \u00c5, but perhaps the actual wavelength shift is calculated differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate K in km/s:\n\nFor Planet1, 0.03/6300 = 4.7619e-6. Multiply by c (3e5 km/s), so K1=4.7619e-6 *3e5 = 0.142857 km/s = 142.857 m/s.\n\nSimilarly, K2=0.04/6300 =6.3492e-6 \u2192 6.3492e-6 *3e5=0.190476 km/s=190.476 m/s.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo K1=142.857 m/s, K2=190.476 m/s.\n\nThus, K1/K2=0.75.\n\nSo the rest of the calculation remains correct.\n\nSo T1/T2\u22480.549, which is approximately 0.55, but option C is 0.53.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approximation is in the cube and square roots. Let me compute 0.75^3 exactly.\n\n0.75^3 = 0.75 * 0.75 =0.5625 \u2192 0.5625 *0.75=0.421875.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo 0.421875 =7 a2/(5 a1 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 a1:\n\n0.421875 *5 a1 =7 a2 \u2192 2.109375 a1 =7 a2 \u2192 a2=2.109375/7 a1 \u2192 0.30134 a1.\n\nSo a2/a1 =0.30134.\n\nsqrt(0.30134)=sqrt(0.30134)= let's compute that precisely.\n\n0.30134 \u2192 0.549, as 0.549^2=0.30140, which is very close.\n\nSo T1/T2=0.549.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.55, but the closest option is C) ~0.53.\n\nPerhaps the difference arises because I used a simplified version of the K formula, ignoring the (M_* + M_p) term. Since M_* is 1.5 solar masses and M_p is much smaller, the approximation is valid, but perhaps introduces a small error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the RV shifts and use the planetary mass and radius to calculate the temperature. But that's not the case as the question provides the RV shifts to find the orbital distances.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the RV method gives K, which depends on the planet's mass and its distance. But perhaps the transit method also gives the distance, but in this case, the transit method gives the radius of the planet and the star, but not the distance.\n\nWait, but the question says both methods are used, but I'm not sure how that relates to the problem. The question is about equilibrium temperature, which depends on the orbital distance (a). So we need a way to find a1 and a2, which we have via the RV shifts.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, given all that, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.55, which is closest to option C (~0.53).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the RV formula, and the actual ratio is sqrt(a1/a2) instead of sqrt(a2/a1 ), which would flip the ratio.\n\nWait, no, because T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R/(2a)), so T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )\n\nIf a2 < a1, then T1 < T2, so the ratio is less than 1.\n\nBut if I had mistakenly taken a1/a2, that would give a ratio greater than 1, which would correspond to option B or D. But that's not the case.\n\nSo I think the calculation is correct as done.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{eq}} = T_{\\text{star}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a\\) is the orbital distance of the planet from the star. Since both planets have the same albedo and the star's radius (\\(R_{\\text{star}}\\)) and effective temperature (\\(T_{\\text{star}}\\)) are the same for both planets, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nThus, the key is to determine the ratio \\(a_2/a_1\\), the orbital distances of Planet2 and Planet1, respectively.\n\n### Step 1: Relating Radial Velocity (RV) Semi-Amplitude to Orbital Distance\nThe RV semi-amplitude \\(K\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nK \\propto \\frac{M_p^{1/3}}{a^{1/3}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(M_p\\) is the planet's mass and \\(a\\) is its orbital distance. For two planets, the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p1} \\cdot a_2}{M_{p2} \\cdot a_1}\\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\(a_2/a_1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculating \\(K_1/K_2\\)\nThe RV semi-amplitude is related to the Doppler shift. For a wavelength shift \\(\\Delta \\lambda\\) and rest wavelength \\(\\lambda\\), the velocity shift is:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda} \\cdot c\n\\]\n\nFor Planet1 (\\(K_1\\)) and Planet2 (\\(K_2\\)):\n\n\\[\nK_1 = \\frac{0.03}{6300} \\cdot 3 \\times 10^8 = 142.86 \\, \\text{m/s}\n\\]\n\\[\nK_2 = \\frac{0.04}{6300} \\cdot 3 \\times 10^8 = 190.48 \\, \\text{m/s}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{142.86}{190.48} \\approx 0.75\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Substituting Values\nThe masses of the planets are \\(M_{p1} = 7 \\, M_{\\text{Earth}}\\) and \\(M_{p2} = 5 \\, M_{\\text{Earth}}\\). Substituting into the formula for \\(a_2/a_1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(0.75\\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{5}{7}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\((0.75)^3\\):\n\n\\[\n(0.75)^3 = 0.421875\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 0.421875 \\cdot \\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.30134\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Temperature Ratio\nThe equilibrium temperature ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{0.30134} \\approx 0.549\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Comparing with Options\nThe closest option to \\(0.549\\) is **C) ~0.53**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{C}",
