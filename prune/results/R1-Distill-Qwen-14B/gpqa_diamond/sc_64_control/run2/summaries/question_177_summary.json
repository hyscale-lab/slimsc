      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nSo, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They observed the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest and found them to be the same. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The problem asks by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming black body radiation.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity as a black body is L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074, where \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, L is proportional to R\u00b2 multiplied by T\u2074.\n\nWait, but in this problem, they mention the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: \u03bb_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So, if the \u03bb_max is the same for both stars, that means their temperatures must be the same? Because if \u03bb_max is same, then T is same. Wait, because \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to T. So if \u03bb1_max = \u03bb2_max, then T1 = T2. Oh, so both stars have the same temperature.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. How does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, that's the Doppler effect. When a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and moving away causes redshift.\n\nBut wait, in this case, Star_2 is moving with a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But how does that affect the observed wavelength? Because the peak emission is at \u03bb_max for each star, but due to their velocities, the observed \u03bb would change. So the observed \u03bb for Star_2 is shifted.\n\nWait, but the question says that through spectroscopy, they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest to be the same. So the observed \u03bb_max for both stars is the same. So that means that the intrinsic \u03bb_max (from each star's temperature) must have been adjusted by the Doppler effect to match.\n\nSo, let's model this. Let me denote:\n\nFor Star_1: since radial velocity is 0, its observed \u03bb_max is the same as its intrinsic \u03bb_max. So \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1 = b / T1.\n\nFor Star_2: it has a radial velocity v. So its observed \u03bb_max is \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) or something like that. Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving away is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )? Or wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think. The Doppler effect for light when the source is moving away (v positive) is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )? Or wait, is it the other way around? Because when a source moves away, the observed wavelength increases (redshift), so \u03bb_obs > \u03bb_rest. So the formula for the Doppler shift when moving away is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), because v is positive. Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), but that might be for the relativistic case. Alternatively, I think the approximate formula for non-relativistic speeds is \u03bb_obs \u2248 \u03bb_rest (1 + v/c), but for higher speeds, the relativistic Doppler formula applies.\n\nBut here, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Let me check if that's a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is about 0.0023c. So, it's a small fraction, so maybe the non-relativistic approximation is acceptable. But perhaps the problem expects us to use the exact formula.\n\nWait, but let's think again. The problem says that the observed \u03bb_max for both stars are the same. So, the observed \u03bb for Star_1 is \u03bb1 = b / T1, and for Star_2, it's \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2 * (1 + v/c), because if Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. But wait, the star's intrinsic \u03bb_max is \u03bb2 = b / T2. But because Star_2 is moving away, the observed \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2 * (1 + v/c). And this is equal to \u03bb1, because the observed wavelengths are the same.\n\nWait, but wait, Star_1 has v=0, so \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1_rest = b/T1.\n\nStar_2 has v=700 km/s (but I need to confirm the direction). Radial velocity is positive when moving away from us. So if Star_2's velocity is +700 km/s, it's moving away. So its observed \u03bb is longer than its intrinsic \u03bb.\n\nSo, \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2_rest * (1 + v/c). But \u03bb2_rest is b/T2.\n\nAnd the observed \u03bb for both stars is the same: \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb2_obs.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nb/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c)\n\nWe can cancel b from both sides:\n\n1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c)\n\nSo, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c)\n\nWait, that seems right. So, T1 is less than T2? Because (1 + v/c) is greater than 1, so T1 is T2 divided by a number bigger than 1. So T1 is smaller.\n\nWait, but wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed \u03bb is longer. So, \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2_rest * (1 + v/c). But \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to T. So \u03bb2_rest = b/T2.\n\nSo, \u03bb2_obs = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c). But \u03bb1_obs is (b/T1). Since \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb2_obs,\n\nb/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c) \u2192 1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v/c) \u2192 T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).\n\nSo T1 is lower than T2.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2. So, if T1 is lower, but R1 is larger, how does that balance out?\n\nBecause luminosity L is proportional to R\u00b2 T\u2074. So L1 = 4\u03c0R1\u00b2\u03c3 T1\u2074, L2 = 4\u03c0R2\u00b2\u03c3 T2\u2074.\n\nSo, the ratio L1/L2 = (R1\u00b2 T1\u2074) / (R2\u00b2 T2\u2074) ) * (\u03c3 / \u03c3) \u2192 ( (R1/R2) )\u00b2 * (T1/T2)^4 )\n\nGiven R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.\n\nT1 = T2 / (1 + v/c), so T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c).\n\nSo, (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1 + v/c)]^4.\n\nPutting it together:\n\nL1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * [1/(1 + v/c)]^4.\n\nSo, the question is to compute this value.\n\nBut wait, I should use the exact Doppler shift formula, especially if v is not negligible compared to c. But since 700 km/s is about 0.0023c (since c is ~3e5 km/s), the non-relativistic approximation might suffice. But perhaps the problem expects the exact formula.\n\nLet me compute v/c. v = 700 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s \u2192 v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/300 \u2248 0.02333.\n\nSo, (1 + v/c) \u2248 1.02333.\n\nSo, 1/(1 + v/c) \u2248 1/1.02333 \u2248 0.977.\n\nSo, [1/(1 + v/c)]^4 \u2248 (0.977)^4 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n0.977 squared is about 0.9545. Squared again: 0.9545^2 \u2248 0.911.\n\nSo, [1/(1 + v/c)]^4 \u2248 0.911.\n\nSo, (1.5)^2 = 2.25.\n\nMultiply 2.25 * 0.911 \u2192 2.25 * 0.911 \u2248 2.051.\n\nWait, but wait, that would make L1/L2 \u2248 2.05. But none of the options are around 2.05. The options are A: ~2.25, B: ~2.32, C: ~2.35, D: ~2.23.\n\nHmm, perhaps the assumption of using the non-relativistic Doppler shift is incorrect, and I should use the relativistic formula. Let me think again.\n\nThe relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), where v is the radial velocity (positive when moving away). So, if the observed \u03bb for Star_2 is same as Star_1, which has no velocity, then:\n\n\u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1_rest.\n\n\u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )\n\nBut \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb2_obs \u2192 \u03bb1_rest = \u03bb2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )\n\nBut \u03bb_rest is proportional to 1/T, so \u03bb1_rest = b/T1, \u03bb2_rest = b/T2.\n\nSo,\n\nb/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )\n\nCancel b,\n\n1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )\n\n\u2192 T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )\n\n= T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )\n\nHmm, so that's different from the non-relativistic case. Let me compute this.\n\nv = 700 km/s \u2192 v/c \u2248 0.002333.\n\nSo, compute (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) \u2248 (0.997667)/(1.002333) \u2248 0.99536.\n\nSo, sqrt(0.99536) \u2248 0.99768.\n\nSo, T1 = T2 * 0.99768.\n\nWhich is approximately T1 \u2248 0.99768 * T2.\n\nSo, T1 / T2 \u2248 0.99768.\n\nSo, (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 (0.99768)^4 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n0.99768^2 = approx 0.99537 (since (1 - x)^2 \u2248 1 - 2x when x is small, so 0.99768 is 1 - 0.00232, so squared is about 1 - 2*0.00232 = 0.99536, which matches).\n\nThen, square that: (0.99537)^2 \u2248 approx 0.99075.\n\nSo, [T1/T2]^4 \u2248 0.99075.\n\nSo, now compute L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.99075.\n\n(1.5)^2 is 2.25.\n\n2.25 * 0.99075 \u2248 2.228.\n\nSo, L1/L2 \u2248 2.228, which is approximately 2.23.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is ~2.23.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations. Because the relativistic Doppler shift formula can't be approximated the same way as the non-relativistic. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) with v=700 km/s.\n\nv/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 = 0.002333333...\n\nSo, 1 - v/c = 0.997666666...\n\n1 + v/c = 1.002333333...\n\nThe ratio is (0.997666666) / (1.002333333) \u2248 let's compute this.\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 0.997666666 = 1 - 0.002333333.\n\nDenominator: 1.002333333 = 1 + 0.002333333.\n\nCompute the ratio: (1 - x)/(1 + x) where x=0.002333333.\n\n(1 - x)/(1 + x) = (1 - 0.002333333)/(1 + 0.002333333) \u2248 (0.997666667)/(1.002333333).\n\nCompute this division: 0.997666667 / 1.002333333.\n\nLet me compute it as 0.997666667 \u00f7 1.002333333.\n\nHmm, perhaps approximate it.\n\n1.002333333 is about 1.00233333.\n\nSo, 0.997666667 / 1.00233333 \u2248 Let's compute this.\n\nLet me write it as (1 - 0.002333333)/(1 + 0.002333333) \u2248 (1 - a)/(1 + a) \u2248 (1 - 2a) for small a.\n\nBecause (1 - a)/(1 + a) \u2248 (1 - a)(1 - a + a\u00b2 - ...) \u2248 1 - 2a when a is small.\n\nSo, a is 0.002333333.\n\nSo, 1 - 2a \u2248 1 - 0.004666666 \u2248 0.995333333.\n\nBut wait, that's a rough approximation. Let's compute more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, compute 0.997666667 \u00f7 1.002333333.\n\nI can compute this as follows:\n\nLet me write both numbers as fractions.\n\n0.997666667 = 0.997666667 \u2248 0.997666667.\n\n1.002333333 = 1.002333333.\n\nSo, 0.997666667 / 1.002333333 \u2248 Let's compute using cross-multiplication.\n\nLet me consider 0.997666667 / 1.002333333 = x.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 1e6 to eliminate decimals:\n\n\u2248 997666.667 / 1002333.333.\n\nLet me compute 997666.667 \u00f7 1002333.333.\n\nApproximate this as (1000000 - 2333.333) / (1000000 + 2333.333).\n\nSo, (1e6 - 2.3333e3) / (1e6 + 2.3333e3).\n\nWe can write this as (1 - (2.3333e3)/1e6 ) / (1 + (2.3333e3)/1e6 ) = (1 - 0.0023333)/(1 + 0.0023333).\n\nWhich is the same as before, so again, (1 - a)/(1 + a) \u2248 1 - 2a, a=0.0023333.\n\nSo, \u2248 1 - 2*0.0023333 = 0.9953334.\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 0.9953334.\n\nSo, sqrt(0.9953334) = ?\n\nWell, sqrt(0.9953334) \u2248 Let me compute it.\n\nWe can use the approximation that sqrt(1 - x) \u2248 1 - x/2 for small x.\n\nHere, 0.9953334 is 1 - 0.0046666.\n\nSo, x=0.0046666.\n\nsqrt(1 - x) \u2248 1 - x/2 \u2192 1 - 0.0046666/2 = 1 - 0.0023333 = 0.9976667.\n\nWait, but wait, that's for x=0.0046666.\n\nWait, let me compute 0.9953334^0.5 more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 0.9953334^(1/2).\n\nLet me think: 0.9953334 is close to 1, so sqrt(0.9953334) is about 0.997666.\n\nWait, because (0.997666)^2 = ?\n\nLet me compute 0.997666 * 0.997666.\n\n= (1 - 0.002334)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.002334) + (0.002334)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.004668 + 0.00000544 \u2248 0.9953364.\n\nWhich is very close to 0.9953334.\n\nSo, sqrt(0.9953334) \u2248 0.997666.\n\nSo, T1 = T2 * 0.997666.\n\nSo, T1/T2 = 0.997666.\n\nNow, [T1/T2]^4 = (0.997666)^4.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n(0.997666)^2 = approx 0.995333.\n\nThen, (0.995333)^2 = let's compute that.\n\n0.995333 * 0.995333.\n\n= (1 - 0.004667) * (1 - 0.004667) \u2248 1 - 2*0.004667 + (0.004667)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.009334 + 0.00002178 \u2248 0.99068778.\n\nSo, [T1/T2]^4 \u2248 0.99068778.\n\nSo, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.99068778.\n\n(1.5)^2 = 2.25.\n\n2.25 * 0.99068778 \u2248 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 Let's compute 2.25 * 0.9907.\n\n2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.\n\n2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.\n\nSo, total is approximately 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.\n\nSo, L1/L2 \u2248 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is ~2.23.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer might be around 2.228, which is about 2.23, so option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier when using the non-relativistic formula, but since the exact Doppler shift requires the relativistic formula, the correct approach is to use the relativistic one, leading to an answer of approximately 2.23.\n\nSo, the correct option is D) ~2.23.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we start by using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:\n\n\\[\nL = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of luminosities is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Relating Temperatures Using Wien's Law and Doppler Shift\nThe problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\\(\\lambda_{\\text{max, obs}}\\)) of both stars are the same. From Wien's law:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{b}{T}\n\\]\n\nFor Star_1 (no radial velocity), \\(\\lambda_{\\text{max, obs,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{max,1}} = \\frac{b}{T_1}\\).\n\nFor Star_2 (radial velocity \\(v = 700 \\, \\text{km/s}\\)), the observed wavelength is redshifted due to the Doppler effect. Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{max, obs,2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{max,2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\lambda_{\\text{max, obs,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{max, obs,2}}\\), we equate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}\n\\]\n\nCanceling \\(b\\) and rearranging:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute \\(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\)\nThe speed of light \\(c = 3 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{km/s}\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{700}{300,000} \\approx 0.002333\n\\]\n\nSubstitute into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\approx \\sqrt{0.995333} \\approx 0.997666\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute \\(\\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4\\)\nRaise \\(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\) to the fourth power:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 \\approx (0.997666)^4\n\\]\n\nFirst, square \\(0.997666\\):\n\n\\[\n(0.997666)^2 \\approx 0.995333\n\\]\n\nThen, square the result:\n\n\\[\n(0.995333)^2 \\approx 0.990688\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 \\approx 0.990688\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compute \\(\\frac{L_1}{L_2}\\)\nThe radius ratio is given as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\\]\n\nSubstitute into the luminosity ratio formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\times 0.990688\n\\]\n\nPerform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times 0.990688 \\approx 2.229\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Match with the Options\nThe closest option to \\(2.229\\) is:\n\n**D) ~2.23**\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",
