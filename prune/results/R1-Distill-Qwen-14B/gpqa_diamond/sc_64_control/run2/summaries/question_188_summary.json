      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Rhombohedral is a type of cubic system where the angles between the axes are not 90 degrees. Oh wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nRhombohedral crystals have three axes of equal length (a = b = c) but the angles between them are all equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So they can be either primitive or have a basis, but the key here is the interatomic distance and the angles.\n\nThe question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice parameter, so that would be 'a' in a cubic system. But since this is rhombohedral, a, b, c are all equal, but the angles are different. Here, all the angles \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are 30 degrees each.\n\nThe question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by 1/d^2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8), but wait, no, that might not be right. Alternatively, maybe it's 1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) [1/(1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8)] or something like that. Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula.\n\nWait, I think the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is derived from the general formula. In a cubic system, it's straightforward: d = a / sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2). But rhombohedral is a bit more complex because of the angles.\n\nAnother approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) (1/a\u00b2) + (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 - 2hk - 2hl - 2kl) (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/(a\u00b2) )\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the Miller indices and the structure factor, but perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c = a0 and angles \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = \u03b8, the interplanar distance can be calculated using:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a0) / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos\u03b8 + 2hl cos\u03b8 + 2kl cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me think about the cubic case. If \u03b8 is 90 degrees, cos\u03b8 is zero, so the formula reduces to d = a0 / sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2), which is correct. So this formula seems right.\n\nGiven that, let's plug in the values. The problem says (111) plane, so h=1, k=1, l=1.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nd = a0 / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1*1)*cos(30\u00b0) + 2*(1*1)*cos(30\u00b0) + 2*(1*1)*cos(30\u00b0) )\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\nSum of squares is 3.\n\nThe cross terms: 2*(1*1) * cos\u03b8 three times, so 3 * 2 * cos\u03b8 * 1*1 = 6 cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-express:\n\nThe expression inside the square root is:\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2hk cos\u03b8 + 2hl cos\u03b8 + 2kl cos\u03b8\n\nFor h=k=l=1:\n\n= 1 +1 +1 + 2*1*1*cos\u03b8 + 2*1*1*cos\u03b8 + 2*1*1*cos\u03b8\n\n= 3 + 6 cos\u03b8\n\nSo denominator is sqrt(3 +6 cos\u03b8).\n\nGiven \u03b8 is 30\u00b0, cos(30\u00b0) is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 6*(0.8660)).\n\nCalculate 6 * 0.8660: 6*0.866 is approximately 5.196.\n\nSo 3 +5.196=8.196.\n\nSo sqrt(8.196)= let's compute that. What is sqrt(8.196)?\n\nWell, sqrt(9)=3, sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863, because 2.86^2 = 8.1796, which is close to 8.196.\n\nWait, 2.86 squared is (2.86)^2 = (2 +0.86)^2 = 2^2 + 2*2*0.86 + 0.86^2 = 4 + 3.44 + 0.7396= 8.1796. Which is a bit less than 8.196. Let's see, 2.86^2=8.1796, 2.87^2= (2.86+0.01)^2= 2.86^2 + 2*2.86*0.01 + 0.01^2 =8.1796 +0.0572 +0.0001= 8.2369. So 8.196 is between 2.86 and 2.87.\n\nSo sqrt(8.196) \u2248 2.863. Let's compute more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 2.863^2:\n\n2.863 * 2.863.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n2.863 * 2.863 = ?\n\nCompute 2800 *2800 =7,840,000, but that's not helpful.\n\nLet me do (2.8 + 0.063)^2.\n\n= 2.8^2 + 2*2.8*0.063 + 0.063^2.\n\n=7.84 + 0.3528 + 0.003969 =7.84 + 0.3528 =8.1928 + 0.003969=8.196769.\n\nAh, so 2.863^2 \u2248 8.1968, which is very close to 8.196. So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.\n\nSo denominator is about 2.863.\n\nSo d = a0 / 2.863.\n\nWait, a0 is 10 Angstroms.\n\nSo d =10 / 2.863 \u2248 3.490 Angstroms?\n\nWait, that can't be right because the options are all around 9 Angstroms. Wait, wait, wait a minute. Oh no! Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, but in a rhombohedral system, a0 is the lattice parameter, which might be the interatomic distance along the axis, but in some cases, it's the distance between nearest neighbors along the edge of the cube or rhombohedron. But perhaps I mixed up the formula.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. The interatomic distance in a cubic system is a0, but in a rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance along the edge is a0, but the actual nearest neighbor distance might be different. Or is a0 the same as the interatomic distance? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is along the edges, which would be a0. So a0 is 10 Angstroms.\n\nWait, but in a cubic system, the nearest neighbor distance is a0. In a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbors are still along the edges, so a0 is the interatomic distance. So in our case, a0 is 10 Angstrom.\n\nSo then, d is 10 / 2.863 \u2248 3.49 Angstrom. But the options given are all around 9 Angstroms. So that can't be right. I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the formula for d in rhombohedral is different. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, another formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2hk cos\u03b8 + 2hl cos\u03b8 + 2kl cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So that can't be the issue.\n\nWait, another approach. Let me recall that in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a rhombohedron, which can be considered as a cube that's been skewed along one diagonal. The interplanar distance calculation would involve the angles between the axes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the general formula for interplanar spacing in terms of the unit cell parameters.\n\nThe general formula is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2/(a\u00b2) ) + (k\u00b2/(b\u00b2) ) + (l\u00b2/(c\u00b2)) ) - 2hk cos\u03b2/(ab) - 2hl cos\u03b3/(ac) - 2kl cos\u03b1/(bc)\n\nBut in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 30 degrees.\n\nSo substituting, 1/d\u00b2 = [h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2]/a0\u00b2 - 2hk cos30\u00b0/(a0\u00b2) - 2hl cos30\u00b0/(a0\u00b2) - 2kl cos30\u00b0/(a0\u00b2)\n\nBecause a = b = c, so ab = a\u00b2, etc.\n\nSo 1/d\u00b2 = [h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 - 2hk cos\u03b8 - 2hl cos\u03b8 - 2kl cos\u03b8 ] / a0\u00b2\n\nWhich is the same as the previous formula.\n\nSo for h=k=l=1, this becomes:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = [3 - 6 cos\u03b8 ] / a0\u00b2\n\nBecause 3 terms of 2 cos\u03b8, each multiplied by 1*1.\n\nSo 3 -6 cos\u03b8 = 3(1- 2 cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, but cos\u03b8 is cos30\u00b0 which is sqrt(3)/2\u22480.866.\n\nSo 3 -6*(0.866) = 3 -5.196 = -2.196.\n\nWait, that gives 1/d\u00b2 = (-2.196)/ (a0\u00b2 )\n\nBut that would imply d\u00b2 is negative, which can't be. So I must have made a mistake in the sign.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the general formula is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2/(a\u00b2) + k\u00b2/(b\u00b2) + l\u00b2/(c\u00b2)) - 2 hk cos \u03b3/(ab) - 2 hl cos \u03b2/(ac) - 2 kl cos \u03b1/(bc)\n\nWait, no, I think I got the angles wrong in the formula. Because in the general formula, the angles between a and b is gamma, etc. Wait, no, wait. The angles in the unit cell are defined as follows: angle \u03b1 is between b and c axes, \u03b2 between a and c, and gamma between a and b. Or wait, maybe I have it the other way around.\n\nWait, I think the standard notation is that angle \u03b1 is between the b and c axes, \u03b2 between a and c, and \u03b3 between a and b. So when a=b=c, and all angles are 30\u00b0, then all those cos terms would be cos30.\n\nWait, perhaps that's where I went wrong. Let me re-express the formula correctly.\n\nIn the general case, the formula is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2/a\u00b2) + (k\u00b2/b\u00b2) + (l\u00b2/c\u00b2) - 2 hk cos \u03b3/(ab) - 2 hl cos \u03b2/(ac) - 2 kl cos \u03b1/(bc)\n\nWait, but for a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 30\u00b0.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a0\u00b2) - 2 hk cos \u03b3/(a0\u00b2) - 2 hl cos \u03b2/(a0\u00b2) - 2 kl cos \u03b1/(a0\u00b2 )\n\nBut since \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30\u00b0, each cos term is cos30\u00b0.\n\nSo,\n\n1/d\u00b2 = [h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 - 2hk cos30\u00b0 - 2hl cos30\u00b0 - 2kl cos30\u00b0 ] / a0\u00b2\n\nWhich is the same as before. So for (111), h=k=l=1:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = [3 - 6 cos30\u00b0 ] / a0\u00b2\n\nAs before, which gives 3 - 6*(\u221a3/2) = 3 -3\u221a3 \u22483 -5.196= -2.196.\n\nBut this gives 1/d\u00b2 negative, which can't be possible. So that can't be right. So I must have messed up the formula.\n\nWait, maybe I have the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) + (2 hk + 2 hl + 2 kl) cos\u03b8 / a\u00b2\n\nWait, that would make sense for a rhombohedral structure. Let me think about it.\n\nIf the angles are all 30 degrees, and a =b =c, then the formula for 1/d\u00b2 is:\n\n(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) + (2 hk + 2 hl + 2 kl) (cos\u03b8) / a\u00b2\n\nWait, but that would be:\n\n[ h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos\u03b8 + 2hl cos\u03b8 + 2kl cos\u03b8 ] / a\u00b2\n\nWhich is same as 1/d\u00b2 = [h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos\u03b8 + 2hl cos\u03b8 + 2kl cos\u03b8 ] / a\u00b2\n\nWhich would make d = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos\u03b8 + 2hl cos\u03b8 + 2kl cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, that makes more sense because the denominator would be positive. Because in the previous approach, the formula had a minus, leading to a negative, which is impossible.\n\nSo perhaps I had the formula wrong earlier. So the correct formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos\u03b8 + 2hl cos\u03b8 + 2kl cos\u03b8 )\n\nAh, that would make more sense. So let me recalculate.\n\nGiven a0 is 10 Angstroms, and \u03b8 =30\u00b0, h=k=l=1.\n\nSo denominator inside sqrt is:\n\n1 +1 +1 + 2*(1*1)*cos30\u00b0 + 2*(1*1)*cos30\u00b0 + 2*(1*1)*cos30\u00b0\n\n= 3 + 6*(\u221a3/2)\n\n\u221a3 is approx 1.732, so \u221a3/2 is approx 0.866.\n\nSo 6 * 0.866 = 5.196.\n\nSo total is 3 +5.196 =8.196.\n\nSo sqrt(8.196) \u22482.863.\n\nSo d =10 /2.863 \u22483.49 Angstrom.\n\nWait, but the options are in the 8-10 range. So that's a problem. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, wait. Another possibility: perhaps the interatomic distance given is not a0, but the nearest neighbor distance in the structure. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance could be along the edges, which is a0, but maybe the structure has more atoms, so a0 is the lattice parameter, and the nearest neighbor distance is something else.\n\nWait, no, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So a0 is 10 Angstrom.\n\nBut why does this give d as 3.49? The options are all much larger.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, another approach: the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) in a rhombohedral system can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (2hk + 2hl + 2kl) cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, no, that would give a different result.\n\nWait, no, that's the formula I used earlier, which led to a negative denominator. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, let me try that. For (111), h=k=l=1.\n\nSo,\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 =3.\n\n2 (hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 = 2*(3) cos30 =6*(\u221a3/2)=3\u221a3\u22485.196.\n\nSo,\n\ndenominator = sqrt(3 -5.196) = sqrt(-2.196) which is imaginary. That's impossible. So that can't be right.\n\nSo that suggests I must have the formula wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the correct formula for a rhombohedral crystal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a0 / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos(180-\u03b8) + 2hl cos(180-\u03b8) + 2kl cos(180-\u03b8) )\n\nWait, why would that be? Because sometimes in crystallography, the angle used is the supplementary angle. For example, in orthorhombic systems, sometimes the angles are obtuse. Hmm, but in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, which are acute.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses the angles as the angles between the lattice vectors. So for the rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are 30 degrees. So in the formula, perhaps we should use cos(30), which is positive.\n\nWait, but earlier that gave a negative in the denominator, which can't be. So I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of reciprocal space. Let me think about the Miller indices and the structure factor.\n\nWait, another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the reciprocal lattice vectors.\n\nIn a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:\n\nb1 = (1/a) (1, 0, 0) \n\nb2 = (1/a) (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8, 0)\n\nb3 = (1/a) (cos\u03b8, (cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 - sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6), (sin\u03c6 + cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) )\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the rhombohedral unit cell as a cube that's been skewed. So the vectors are a, b, c, each of length a0, and angles between them are 30 degrees.\n\nSo, the vectors can be represented in a coordinate system. Let's say a is along x, b is in the xy-plane making 30 degrees with a, and c is above the xy-plane making 30 degrees with both a and b.\n\nSo, the vectors are:\n\na = a0 (1, 0, 0)\n\nb = a0 (cos30\u00b0, sin30\u00b0, 0) = a0 (sqrt(3)/2, 1/2, 0)\n\nc = a0 (cos30\u00b0, (cos30\u00b0 cos60\u00b0 - sin30\u00b0 sin60\u00b0), sin60\u00b0 )\n\nWait, why? Because the angle between a and c is 30 degrees, and between b and c is also 30 degrees. So the coordinates of c would involve some trigonometric functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the metric tensor.\n\nThe metric tensor for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c = a0 and angles \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 30\u00b0 is:\n\ng = [ [ a0\u00b2, a0\u00b2 cos\u03b3, a0\u00b2 cos\u03b2 ],\n       [ a0\u00b2 cos\u03b3, a0\u00b2, a0\u00b2 cos\u03b1 ],\n       [ a0\u00b2 cos\u03b2, a0\u00b2 cos\u03b1, a0\u00b2 ] ]\n\nBut since all angles are 30\u00b0, this becomes:\n\ng = [\n [a0\u00b2, a0\u00b2 cos30, a0\u00b2 cos30 ],\n [a0\u00b2 cos30, a0\u00b2, a0\u00b2 cos30 ],\n [a0\u00b2 cos30, a0\u00b2 cos30, a0\u00b2 ]\n]\n\nSo, the (hkl) plane has a normal vector (h, k, l). The interplanar distance d is related to the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vector components are given by:\n\ng'_{hkl} = (h, k, l) in terms of the reciprocal basis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the formula involving the metric tensor. The interplanar distance d is given by:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) / a0\u00b2 + (hk + hl + kl) (2 cos\u03b8)/a0\u00b2\n\nWait, because the metric tensor components would be involved in calculating the reciprocal.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a standard formula for rhombohedral interplanar distance.\n\nWait, I found a resource that says for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c and angles \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = \u03b8, the interplanar distance is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2 hk cos\u03b8 + 2 hl cos\u03b8 + 2 kl cos\u03b8 )\n\nWhich is the same as the first formula I used. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but that gives d=10/2.863\u22483.49 Angstrom, which is not among the options. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a0. Maybe the interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral structure is along the edge, which is a0. So that should be correct.\n\nWait, but the options are 9ish. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, maybe the formula for the interplanar distance is different. Let me think about the (111) plane in a cubic system. The interplanar distance is a0/sqrt(3) \u22485.7735 Angstroms if a0 is 10.\n\nWait, but in the rhombohedral case, the interplanar distance would be shorter or longer? Since the angles are smaller than 90, the spacing would be different.\n\nWait, in a cubic system, the (111) plane is at 5.77 Angstroms. In a rhombohedral structure with angles 30\u00b0, perhaps the interplanar distance is longer or shorter?\n\nWait, if the angles are smaller, the lattice is more compressed. So the planes might be further apart. Or maybe the opposite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a0 / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - 2hk cos\u03b8 - 2hl cos\u03b8 - 2kl cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, but that would give denominator sqrt(3 -6*(\u221a3/2))=sqrt(3-3\u221a3) which is imaginary, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me consider the volume of the unit cell.\n\nThe volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2\u03b1 - cos\u00b2\u03b2 - cos\u03b3\u00b2 + 2 cos\u03b1 cos\u03b2 cos\u03b3 )\n\nBut for a rhombohedral system with \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30\u00b0, this becomes:\n\nV = a^3 * sqrt( 1 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )\n\nWait, perhaps that's more complicated than I need.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance using the Miller indices and the angles.\n\nWait, another approach: the distance between two adjacent planes (hkl) is given by the formula:\n\nd = (a0) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, but when I plug in the values, I get a negative denominator, which is impossible. So that can't be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 )\n\nWhich would give a positive denominator.\n\nSo for (111), it's sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2)) = sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).\n\nCompute 3 +3*1.732=3+5.196=8.196. So sqrt(8.196)=2.863.\n\nSo d=10/2.863\u22483.49 Angstroms.\n\nBut the options are much larger. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something.\n\nWait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a0 but the distance between two adjacent atoms in the crystal, which might be along the edge of the rhombohedron, which is a0, so that should be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong plane. The (111) plane in a rhombohedral system. Maybe the formula is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal of the interplanar distance. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Bragg law, but that's probably not helpful here.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms along the edge, which is a0. But in a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance is a0, so a0 is 10 Angstrom.\n\nWait, but why is the calculated d so small? The options are all about 9, which is close to a0. So maybe I'm missing a factor of sqrt(3), but I don't see where.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the interplanar distance formula is incorrect, and the correct formula is:\n\nd = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2hk cos\u03b8 + 2hl cos\u03b8 + 2kl cos\u03b8 ) ]\n\nWait, that would give d =10 * sqrt(3) / (3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2) )\n\nWhich is 10*sqrt(3)/(3+3*sqrt(3)) )\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\n= 10*sqrt(3) / [3(1 + sqrt(3)) ) ]\n\n= 10 sqrt(3) / [3(1 + sqrt(3)) ) ]\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sqrt(3)):\n\n=10 sqrt(3) (1 - sqrt(3)) / [3(1 -3) ) ]\n\n=10 sqrt(3) (1 - sqrt(3)) / [3*(-2) ) ]\n\n=10 sqrt(3) (1 - sqrt(3)) / (-6 )\n\n= -10 sqrt(3) (1 - sqrt(3)) /6\n\n=10 sqrt(3) (sqrt(3) -1 ) /6\n\n=10 (3 - sqrt(3)) /6\n\n=10 ( (3 -1.732) ) /6\n\n=10*(1.268)/6 \u224810*0.2113=2.113 Angstrom.\n\nNo, that's even smaller. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about another approach. Maybe the interplanar distance can be found using the volume of the unit cell and the volume of the parallelepiped defined by the hkl plane.\n\nWait, the volume of the unit cell is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2\u03b1 - cos\u00b2\u03b2 - cos\u00b2\u03b3 + 2 cos\u03b1 cos\u03b2 cos\u03b3 )\n\nFor a rhombohedral system with \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30\u00b0, V= a^3 * sqrt( 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 ) )\n\nWait, let's compute this.\n\nFirst, compute each term:\n\ncos30= sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866.\n\nSo,\n\n1 -3*( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2 )^3 )\n\n=1 -3*(3/4) + 2*( (3*sqrt(3))/8 )\n\n=1 - 9/4 + (6 sqrt(3))/8\n\n= (4/4 -9/4) + (3 sqrt(3)/4 )\n\n= (-5/4) + (3 sqrt(3)/4 )\n\n= [ -5 +3 sqrt(3) ] /4\n\nCompute 3 sqrt(3)\u22485.196.\n\nSo,\n\n-5 +5.196\u22480.196.\n\nSo,\n\n[0.196]/4\u22480.049.\n\nSo, sqrt(0.049)=approx 0.221.\n\nSo, V= a^3 * 0.221.\n\nBut a=10, so V=1000 *0.221=221 Ang^3.\n\nHmm, but not sure how this helps.\n\nAlternatively, the volume of the reciprocal lattice unit cell is 1/V.\n\nBut perhaps this isn't helpful for finding the interplanar distance.\n\nWait, another idea: the interplanar distance d is related to the volume and the area of the (hkl) plane.\n\nWait, the area of the (hkl) plane in the unit cell is A = (a^2) / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 hk cos\u03b8 + 2 hl cos\u03b8 + 2 kl cos\u03b8 )) )\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the Miller indices and the structure factor, but I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the (111) plane in a cubic system. The interplanar distance is a0 / sqrt(3) \u22485.7735 Angstroms. But in a rhombohedral system with angles 30\u00b0, perhaps the planes are further apart.\n\nWait, let me think about the (100) plane. In cubic, d= a0. In rhombohedral, what would it be?\n\nUsing the formula d =a0 / sqrt(1 + 2*1*0 * cos\u03b8 + ... ), wait, no. For (100), h=1, k=0, l=0.\n\nSo,\n\nd = a0 / sqrt(1 + 0 +0 + 0 +0 +0) = a0/1 = a0=10 Angstrom.\n\nSo the (100) plane is at 10 Angstrom.\n\nSimilarly, the (110) plane would be:\n\nh=1, k=1, l=0.\n\nd= a0 / sqrt(1+1+0 + 2*1*1 cos\u03b8 +0 +0 )\n\n=10 / sqrt(2 + 2*(\u221a3/2)) )\n\n=10 / sqrt(2 +\u221a3 )\n\n\u221a3\u22481.732, so 2 +1.732=3.732.\n\nsqrt(3.732)= approx 1.931.\n\nSo d=10/1.931\u22485.175 Angstrom.\n\nBut in our case, the (111) plane gives d=3.49 Angstroms, which is smaller than the (110) plane. That seems counterintuitive because the (111) plane is more closely packed.\n\nWait, but the options are around 9 Angstroms. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the actual formula gives a larger d.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is d = a0 / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 - 2hk cos\u03b8 - 2hl cos\u03b8 - 2kl cos\u03b8 )\n\nWhich would give for (111):\n\n3 -6*(\u221a3/2 )=3-3\u221a3\u22483-5.196=-2.196.\n\nWhich is negative, impossible. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is d= a0 / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos\u03b8 + 2hl cos\u03b8 + 2kl cos\u03b8 )\n\nWhich gives 3 +6*(\u221a3/2 )=3+5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)=2.863. d=10/2.863\u22483.49 Angstroms.\n\nBut the options are all around 9, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, maybe I should switch the denominator. Maybe the formula is:\n\nd= a0 * sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2hk cos\u03b8 + ... ) \n\nBut that would make d even smaller.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the interplanar distance can be calculated using the following approach:\n\nThe interplanar distance d is given by 1/d = | (h a + k b + l c ) \u00b7 n |, where n is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vector analysis. Let me model the lattice vectors.\n\nLet me consider the lattice vectors as:\n\na = a0 (1,0,0 )\n\nb = a0 (cos30\u00b0, sin30\u00b0, 0 )\n\nc = a0 (cos30\u00b0, (cos30\u00b0 cos60\u00b0 - sin30\u00b0 sin60\u00b0 ), sin60\u00b0 )\n\nWait, why? Because the angle between a and c is 30\u00b0, and between b and c is also 30\u00b0.\n\nSo, let me compute the components.\n\nCompute cos30\u00b0=\u221a3/2\u22480.866, sin30=0.5, cos60=0.5, sin60=\u221a3/2\u22480.866.\n\nSo,\n\nb = a0 (0.866, 0.5, 0 )\n\nc = a0 (0.866, [ (0.866)(0.5) - (0.5)(0.866) ], 0.866 )\n\nWait, the y-component of c:\n\n(0.866 * 0.5) = 0.433, and (0.5 * 0.866 )=0.433.\n\nSo,\n\n0.433 - 0.433=0.\n\nSo, c = a0 (0.866, 0, 0.866 )\n\nSo, the three lattice vectors are:\n\na = (10, 0, 0 )\n\nb = (8.66, 5, 0 )\n\nc = (8.66, 0, 8.66 )\n\nWait, wait, a0 is 10, so scaling:\n\na =10*(1,0,0 )= (10,0,0 )\n\nb=10*(0.866, 0.5, 0 )= (8.66,5,0 )\n\nc=10*(0.866,0,0.866 )= (8.66, 0,8.66 )\n\nNow, the (111) plane has normal vector (1,1,1). The equation of the plane is x + y + z =d.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should find the reciprocal lattice vector for (1,1,1).\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:\n\nb1 = (1/a) (1,0,0 )\n\nb2 = (1/a) (0,1,0 ) - (1/a) (cos\u03b8, 0,0 )\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the reciprocal vectors are computed using the formula:\n\nb1 = (2\u03c0/a) (1, 0, 0 ) \n\nBut perhaps it's better to find the normal vector to the (111) plane.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vectors are defined such that:\n\nb1 \u00b7 a2 = 2\u03c0 \u03b412,\n\nb1 \u00b7 a3 = 2\u03c0 \u03b413,\n\nand so on.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the distance between two adjacent planes (111). The distance can be found by taking the projection of the lattice vectors onto the normal direction of the plane.\n\nThe normal vector to the (111) plane is n = (1,1,1). To find the distance between planes, I can take the scalar product of the lattice vectors with this normal and find the reciprocal.\n\nWait, the interplanar distance d is given by:\n\nd = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * (a0 / |a0| )\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the plane's normal vector.\n\nWait, the distance between two planes can be found by projecting the lattice vectors onto the normal vector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distance is given by the formula:\n\nd = (1/ sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 )) * (a0 / |n| )\n\nBut I'm not confident.\n\nAnother approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:\n\nd = (a0) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 hk cos\u03b8 + 2 hl cos\u03b8 + 2 kl cos\u03b8 )\n\nWhich, as before, gives d=10 / sqrt(8.196)\u22483.49 Angstrom.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is d = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / ( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 hk cos\u03b8 + 2 hl cos\u03b8 + 2 kl cos\u03b8 ) )\n\nBut that would give d=10 * sqrt(3) /8.196\u224810*1.732/8.196\u224817.32/8.196\u22482.113 Angstrom.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the given interatomic distance is not a0 but the nearest neighbor distance in the (111) direction. So a0 would be larger.\n\nWait, no. The question states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. That's usually the nearest neighbor distance along the edges of the lattice, which would be a0 in a cubic system.\n\nWait, but in a rhombohedral system, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is not a0. Let me think. The edges are of length a0, but in a rhombohedron, the nearest atoms are along the edges, so the nearest neighbor distance is a0.\n\nSo a0=10 Angstrom.\n\nSo, according to the formula, the interplanar distance for (111) is about 3.49 Angstrom. But none of the options match that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct formula is d = a0 / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 - 2hk cos\u03b8 - 2hl cos\u03b8 - 2kl cos\u03b8 )\n\nBut then, as before, it gives a negative denominator, which can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use cos(180-30)=cos150= -sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, if I use cos(150) instead of cos30, the formula would be:\n\nd =a0 / sqrt(3 +6*(-sqrt(3)/2) )\n\n= a0 / sqrt(3 -3*sqrt(3) )\n\nWhich would give sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So that can't be.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses cos(30\u00b0) but in a different way. Let me think about the structure factor.\n\nThe structure factor for a plane (hkl) is given by F = f sum_{atoms} exp( 2\u03c0i (hx a_x +ky a_y +lz a_z) )\n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps in finding the interplanar distance.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the (111) plane.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vector for (111) is (1,1,1). The magnitude of this vector in reciprocal space is 1/d.\n\nThe magnitude of (1,1,1) in reciprocal space is given by the metric tensor. So,\n\n(1/d)^2 = (1^2) (g11) + (1^2) (g22) + (1^2) (g33) + 2*(1*1) g12 + 2*(1*1) g13 + 2*(1*1) g23 )\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. The metric tensor in reciprocal space is the inverse of the metric tensor in real space.\n\nThe real space metric tensor g is:\n\ng = [\n [a0\u00b2, a0\u00b2 cos\u03b8, a0\u00b2 cos\u03b8],\n [a0\u00b2 cos\u03b8, a0\u00b2, a0\u00b2 cos\u03b8],\n [a0\u00b2 cos\u03b8, a0\u00b2 cos\u03b8, a0\u00b2 ]\n]\n\nSo the reciprocal metric tensor g* is the inverse of g.\n\nSo to find (1/d)^2, I need to compute (h, k, l) \u00b7 g* \u00b7 (h, k, l)^T.\n\nFor (1,1,1):\n\n(1/d)^2 = [1 1 1] * g* * [1;1;1]\n\nBut calculating the inverse of g is a bit involved.\n\nLet me attempt to compute g*.\n\nThe matrix g is:\n\n[ a0\u00b2, a0\u00b2 c, a0\u00b2 c ]\n\n[ a0\u00b2 c, a0\u00b2, a0\u00b2 c ]\n\n[ a0\u00b2 c, a0\u00b2 c, a0\u00b2 ]\n\nWhere c=cos30=\u221a3/2.\n\nWe can write g as a0\u00b2 * G, where G is:\n\nG = [\n [1, c, c],\n [c, 1, c],\n [c, c, 1]\n]\n\nSo, the inverse g* is (1/a0\u00b2) * G^{-1}.\n\nSo first, compute G^{-1}.\n\nThe determinant of G can be found as:\n\n|G| = 1*(1*1 - c^2) - c*(c*1 - c^2) + c*(c^2 - c*1 )\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n= 1*(1 - c^2) - c*(c - c^2) + c*(c^2 - c )\n\n= (1 - c^2) - c^2 (1 - c) + c (c (c-1) )\n\n= (1 - c^2) - c^2 + c^3 + c^2 (c-1 )\n\nHmm, this is getting messy. Maybe it's easier to compute using a formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the inverse of G.\n\nThe inverse of a 3x3 matrix can be found using the formula involving the adjugate matrix and the determinant.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern. Let me think: for a matrix with diagonal elements a and off-diagonal elements b, the inverse is [ (a - b) / (a(a-2b)) ] for the diagonal and [ -b/(a(a-2b)) ] for the off-diagonal.\n\nWait, for a matrix like G where all diagonal elements are 1 and all off-diagonal are c.\n\nThe inverse can be found as:\n\nG^{-1} = (1/(1 - 3c^2)) * [\n [1 - c, -c, -c],\n [-c, 1 - c, -c],\n [-c, -c, 1 - c]\n ]\n\nWait, let me check this.\n\nMultiply G by G^{-1}:\n\nFirst row of G: [1, c, c]\n\nMultiply by first column of G^{-1}:\n\n1*(1 -c) + c*(-c) + c*(-c) = (1 -c) - c^2 -c^2 =1 -c -2c^2.\n\nWe want this to be 1/(1-3c^2) * (1 if on diagonal, 0 otherwise). So:\n\n1 -c -2c^2 = (1/(1-3c^2)) * 1.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 -c -2c^2) = 1/(1-3c^2).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1-3c^2):\n\n(1 -c -2c^2)(1-3c^2) =1.\n\nExpand left side:\n\n=1*(1) +1*(-3c^2) + (-c)*1 + (-c)*(-3c^2) + (-2c^2)*1 + (-2c^2)*(-3c^2)\n\n=1 -3c^2 -c +3c^3 -2c^2 +6c^4\n\n=1 -c + (-3c^2 -2c^2) +3c^3 +6c^4\n\n=1 -c -5c^2 +3c^3 +6c^4.\n\nSet equal to 1:\n\n1 -c -5c^2 +3c^3 +6c^4 =1.\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n-c -5c^2 +3c^3 +6c^4=0.\n\nFactor:\n\nc(-1 -5c +3c^2 +6c^3 )=0.\n\nSo, either c=0 or (-1-5c +3c^2 +6c^3 )=0.\n\nBut c=\u221a3/2\u22480.866.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos \u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b2 + 2kl cos \u03b3), where a is the lattice parameter, and h, k, l are the Miller indices.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Oh right, in a rhombohedral crystal, all the edges are equal (a = b = c) and all the angles are the same (\u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3). That should simplify the formula a bit. So the formula becomes d = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 ) because all the angles are the same, so cos \u03b1 = cos \u03b2 = cos \u03b3.\n\nIn this problem, the Miller indices are (1,1,1). So h=1, k=1, l=1. Let me plug those into the formula.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the numerator: a is given as 10 Angstrom. So the numerator is 10.\n\nThe denominator is sqrt( (1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) * cos(30\u00b0) ). Let's compute each part.\n\n1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 +1\u00b2 is 3. Then, 2*(1+1+1) is 2*3=6. And cos(30 degrees) is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.8660.\n\nSo the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 6 * 0.8660). Let me calculate that.\n\n6 * 0.8660 is about 5.196. Adding that to 3 gives 8.196. So the denominator is sqrt(8.196). Let me compute sqrt(8.196). Hmm, sqrt(8) is about 2.828, sqrt(9) is 3. So 8.196 is just a bit over 8. Let's see: 2.86 squared is 8.1796 (since 2.86^2 = (2.8)^2 + 2*(2.8)(0.06) + (0.06)^2 \u2248 7.84 + 0.336 + 0.0036 \u2248 8.1796). Wait, but 8.196 is a bit higher. So maybe around 2.862?\n\nWait, 2.86^2 is 8.1796, as I thought. Let me compute 2.862^2: (2.86 + 0.002)^2 = (2.86)^2 + 2*(2.86)(0.002) + (0.002)^2 = 8.1796 + 0.01144 + 0.000004 = approximately 8.191. Hmm, that's close to 8.196. So maybe 2.862^2 is 8.191, so the sqrt of 8.196 would be approximately 2.862 plus a bit more. Let's see: 2.863^2 = (2.862 + 0.001)^2 = 8.191 + 2*(2.862)(0.001) + (0.001)^2 \u2248 8.191 + 0.005724 + 0.000001 \u2248 8.1967. Oh, that's just about 8.1967, which is very close to 8.196. So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.\n\nSo the denominator is 2.863. So d = 10 / 2.863 \u2248 Let's compute that. 10 divided by 2.863.\n\nLet me compute 2.863 \u00d7 3 = 8.589. 2.863 \u00d7 3.48 \u2248 Let me think: 2.863 * 3 =8.589, 2.863 * 0.48 is about 1.374, so total around 9.963. Hmm, but wait, 2.863 \u00d7 3.48 = ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute 10 / 2.863. Let me approximate:\n\n2.863 \u00d7 3.487 \u2248 10? Let me compute 2.863 \u00d7 3.487. Well, 2.863 \u00d7 3 = 8.589, 2.863 \u00d7 0.487 \u2248 let's compute 0.487 * 2.863.\n\n0.4 * 2.863 = 1.1452, 0.08 * 2.863 = 0.22904, 0.007 * 2.863 \u2248 0.020041. So adding those: 1.1452 + 0.22904 = 1.37424 + 0.020041 \u2248 1.39428. So 0.487 * 2.863 \u2248 1.3943. So 3.487 \u00d7 2.863 \u2248 8.589 + 1.3943 = 9.9833. Close to 10.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find 10/2.863. So 3.487 is approximately 10/2.863. So 3.487 is about 3.488, so 3.488 Angstrom? Wait, no, the calculation is 10 divided by 2.863, which is approximately 3.488.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait a second. Because in the formula, the denominator is sqrt(8.196), which is approximately 2.863. So d = 10 / 2.863 \u2248 3.488 Angstrom?\n\nWait, but the options given are all around 9-10 Angstrom. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nOh wait a second! Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Wait, I think I might have the formula wrong.\n\nWait, another thought. The general formula for interplanar distance is 1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) + 2(hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b1)/(a\u00b2), right? Because in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3. So maybe I should have used that. Wait, but in the formula, the angles between the lattice vectors are the same. So in this case, all the angles \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are 30 degrees.\n\nWait, no, in the formula, the interplanar distance formula for cubic systems is different, but rhombohedral is a more general case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to find the correct formula.\n\nIn a general rhombohedral system, the lattice is defined by a, a, a, with angles \u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b1. So the formula for interplanar distance is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWait, but wait, that's not right. Wait, I think I'm confusing some terms. Let me try to recall.\n\nWait, no, another approach: the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal can be written as d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 ), because \u03b1 is the angle between the edges, right?\n\nSo in our case, h=k=l=1, and \u03b1=30 degrees.\n\nSo, substituting the values:\n\nNumerator: a=10 Angstrom.\n\nDenominator: sqrt( (1+1+1) + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos(30) )\n\nWait, let's compute that denominator again.\n\nh\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 = 1 +1 +1 =3.\n\n2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) = 2*(3)=6.\n\nSo 6 * cos(30\u00b0) = 6*(\u221a3/2) = 3\u221a3 \u2248 5.196.\n\nSo total under the sqrt is 3 + 5.196 =8.196.\n\nSo sqrt(8.196) \u2248 2.863.\n\nSo d = 10 / 2.863 \u2248 3.488 Angstrom. But wait, looking at the options, all the options are around 9-10 Angstrom, which is way larger than 3.4. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Did I mix up the units or the formula? Let me think again. Oh wait! No, wait, perhaps the question is about a rhombohedral crystal, but the angles given are 30 degrees, but maybe in a rhombohedral system, the angles are between the vectors, not the angles of the planes. Or perhaps I got the formula wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is different. Let me look it up in my notes.\n\nWait, another thought. Oh, I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the lattice can be considered as a special case of a hexagonal system, but no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the lattice parameter, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters. The general formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2/a\u00b2) + (k\u00b2/b\u00b2) + (l\u00b2/c\u00b2) - (2 hk cos \u03b3)/(a b) - (2 hl cos \u03b2)/(a c) - (2 kl cos \u03b1)/(b c) + (something else?)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing it up. No, the correct formula is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) + (k\u00b2)/(b\u00b2) + (l\u00b2)/(c\u00b2) - (2 hk cos \u03b3)/(a b) - (2 hl cos \u03b2)/(a c) - (2 kl cos \u03b1)/(b c) )\n\nWait, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3. So substituting a = b = c, and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3, the formula becomes:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 / a\u00b2\n\nSo 1/d\u00b2 = [ (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 ] / a\u00b2\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So I must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation because I used a plus instead of a minus.\n\nOh no! So I had the wrong sign in the formula. That would change everything.\n\nSo let me recalculate with the correct formula.\n\nSo, h =1, k=1, l=1, \u03b1=30\u00b0, a=10 Angstrom.\n\nCompute the denominator inside the square root:\n\nh\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 = 3.\n\n2(hk + hl + kl) = 6, since each term is 1, and there are three terms, so 2*(1+1+1) =6.\n\ncos \u03b1 = cos 30\u00b0 = sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660.\n\nSo, the denominator is sqrt(3 - 6 * 0.8660 ).\n\nCompute 6 * 0.8660 =5.196.\n\nSo 3 -5.196 = -2.196. Wait, that's negative. But the square root of a negative number is impossible. That can't be right. Did I do that correctly?\n\nWait, that would imply that d is imaginary, which is impossible. So I must have messed up the formula again. Maybe the formula has a plus, not a minus.\n\nWait, I'm getting really confused. Let me go back.\n\nThe correct formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWait, but wait, I've seen sources where it's a plus. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking it up, the correct formula for a rhombohedral lattice is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWait, but wait, no, that would give a larger denominator, leading to a smaller d. But in the case of \u03b1=60 degrees, for example, for a cubic close-packed structure, the formula would adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, but in our case, when \u03b1 is 30 degrees, let's compute.\n\nWait, but wait, if I have a minus, the denominator would be sqrt(3 - 5.196) = sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should refer to the correct formula. Let me try to recall. I think the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut in that case, for some angles, it would yield a real number, and others not.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about a simple case. For example, in a cubic system, where \u03b1=90 degrees, cos \u03b1=0. So the formula becomes d = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 ), which is correct. So in that case, the formula with a plus would give the same as the cubic case when cos \u03b1 is zero, but wait, if the formula has a plus, then for a cubic system, it would be correct. So perhaps I was right the first time.\n\nWait, but when I calculated earlier with a plus, I got d=3.488, which is not in the options. So perhaps the mistake is somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps the interatomic distance is given, but the lattice parameter a is different. Wait, no, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter only if it's a simple cubic structure, right?\n\nWait, no, wait. The interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors. In a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the lattice points, so the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. So a is 10 Angstrom.\n\nWait, but that brings us back to the same problem. So perhaps I should think about whether the formula should have a plus or a minus.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's take a simple case where h=k=l=1 and \u03b1=60 degrees. Then, the formula would be d= a / sqrt(3 + 6 * 0.5 ) = a / sqrt(3 +3) = a/sqrt(6). If a is 10, that's 10/sqrt(6) \u22484.082 Angstrom.\n\nBut that's for \u03b1=60. For \u03b1=30, cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2\u22480.866.\n\nSo with the same hkl=111, the denominator would be sqrt(3 + 6 * 0.866) = sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863, so d=10/2.863\u22483.488 Angstrom.\n\nBut the options are all around 9-10, which is three times larger. So perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the lattice parameter. Wait, that can't be right because interplanar distance is inversely proportional to the square root of the sum, so it's a in the numerator.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I messed up the Miller indices. No, the question says (111) plane.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the way I'm interpreting the angles. In a rhombohedral system, the angles are between the lattice vectors. So perhaps the formula should involve cos(180 - \u03b1) or something like that. Alternatively, maybe I should use cos(\u03b1) where \u03b1 is the angle between the vectors, but perhaps the formula uses cos(\u03c0 - \u03b1) or something else. Hmm, that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. The correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut then, when I plug in h=k=l=1 and \u03b1=30 degrees, I get d=10/2.863\u22483.488 Angstrom, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the angles given are the external angles, and I should use 180-30=150 degrees for the internal angles between the vectors. Because in a rhombohedral crystal, the angles between the vectors are often taken as the acute angles. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles are between the vectors a, b, c, which form a rhombus. So if the angle is 30 degrees, that's the angle between each pair of vectors.\n\nWait, but if the angle between the vectors is 30 degrees, then cos(30) is positive. But maybe I should be using cos(180-30)=cos(150 degrees) which is -sqrt(3)/2\u2248-0.866. Because in some contexts, the angle used in the formula is the angle inside the rhombohedron, which can be obtuse. Hmm, that's a possibility.\n\nSo let me try that. So cos(150 degrees)= -sqrt(3)/2 \u2248-0.866.\n\nSo substituting that into the formula:\n\nDenominator inside the sqrt:\n\n3 + 6*(-0.866) =3 -5.196= -2.196. Which is negative, which can't be. So that would give an imaginary d, which is impossible. So that can't be right either.\n\nHmm, so that can't be the case. So perhaps I was correct the first time, but then why are the options not matching?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another source I found online says that the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut that's what I used earlier. So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 3.488 Angstrom. But none of the options are anywhere near that. The options are all around 9-10 Angstrom, which is three times larger.\n\nWait, maybe the question is actually about the lattice parameter a being 10 Angstrom, but the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms, which in some structures is a/\u221a2 or similar. But in a simple cubic structure, a is the interatomic distance, so I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, and I should be using a different approach.\n\nWait, another approach: the reciprocal lattice. But that might complicate things more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut if I get a result not matching the options, perhaps I should think about another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the denominator.\n\nWait, let me recompute 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3 + 3*sqrt(3). Because 6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3*sqrt(3)= approx 5.196.\n\nSo 3 +5.196=8.196. The square root of 8.196 is approximately 2.863. So 10/2.863\u22483.488 Angstrom.\n\nBut the options are all around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct formula uses a minus.\n\nWait, another thought. Maybe the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nIn that case, with h=1, k=1, l=1, and cos(30)=0.866, then the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 6*0.866) = sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So that's impossible.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nBut in a rhombohedral system, \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30 degrees, so that becomes:\n\nd = a / sqrt(3 - 6 cos 30 )\n\nWhich again gives sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So that can't be the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula altogether. Let me think about another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut perhaps in some references, the angles used are the ones between the planes, not the lattice vectors. I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is written as:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) (1/a\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (cos \u03b1)/(a\u00b2)\n\nWhich would give the same as before.\n\nSo I'm stuck. According to this, the answer I get is around 3.488 Angstrom, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.\n\nWait, let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question says: \"interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom\". Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms. In a simple cubic structure, that's equal to a. But in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance along the cube diagonal would be different, perhaps? Or maybe in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a, because the atoms are at the lattice points.\n\nWait, but perhaps the given interatomic distance is not along the lattice vectors but along some other direction. For example, in a face-centered cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a\u221a2/2, but in a simple cubic it's a.\n\nWait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is along the [111] direction. Hmm, but that's complicating things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the lattice constant a as 10 Angstrom, and the interatomic distance is the same as a. So I think I'm correct in taking a=10.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another thought. Maybe the formula I'm using is for the d-spacing in reciprocal space, but I think that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of d. But no, the formula is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the denominator again.\n\nCompute the denominator: sqrt(3 + 6 * cos(30\u00b0)).\n\n3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3 +3*sqrt(3)\u22483+5.196=8.196.\n\nsqrt(8.196)=2.863.\n\nSo 10/2.863\u22483.488 Angstrom.\n\nBut the options are all around 9. So I'm missing something. Could the interatomic distance be 10 Angstrom, but the lattice parameter is different?\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the interatomic distance with the lattice parameter. Wait, in a simple cubic system, the interatomic distance is a. But in a rhombohedral system, perhaps the interatomic distance is a multiplied by something.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at a lattice point, so the distance between nearest neighbors is a. So I think a=10 is correct.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another approach. Let me think about the structure factor for a rhombohedral system, but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is different. Let me try to find an alternative formula.\n\nWait, another source says that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar spacing is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWhich is what I used earlier.\n\nSo I think I'm correct, but the answer isn't matching the options. So perhaps I should check the calculation again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute that again.\n\n6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3*sqrt(3)=approx 5.196. So 3+5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)=2.863.\n\nSo 10/2.863\u22483.488. So I think that's correct.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA) 9.08\nB) 8.95\nC) 9.54\nD)10.05\n\nAll are around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct approach is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal of the interplanar distance. But that would give around 0.285, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of the sum inside the square root. So 1/(sum) * a. But that would be a/(sum), which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should be using a different formula that involves the volume of the unit cell.\n\nWait, another approach: the volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 \u03b1 + 2 cos^3 \u03b1).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the d-spacing. Let me compute 1/d, but that would be 0.285, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 9.54 Angstrom. But that would be if the denominator is 10.48, for example.\n\nWait, let me think: if the denominator is 1.048, then 10/1.048\u22489.54. How can I get the denominator to be around 1.048?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the formula and it should be a multiplied by sqrt(...). No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( ... ), but that would give a much larger value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + ...), but that would give a much smaller value.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd = a / (sqrt( (h +k +l)^2 - (something) )) )\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )) )\n\nBut that would give denominator sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. According to the formula I know, the answer is about 3.488, but none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the angles given are the external angles, and the internal angles are 180-30=150 degrees. So cos(150 degrees)= -sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo substituting that into the formula:\n\ndenominator= sqrt(3 + 6*(-0.866) )=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.\n\nSo that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should have a minus in the denominator. So denominator= sqrt(3 - 6 * cos(30)).\n\n3 -5.196= -2.196. Again, negative. So no.\n\nHmm. I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should look for another way to approach the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h +k + l)^2 (1 + 2 cos \u03b1) )\n\nWait, that's not correct, but let me test it.\n\nh=k=l=1, so sum=3. So denominator= sqrt(9 * (1 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2) )) = sqrt(9*(1 + sqrt(3)) )=3*sqrt(1 +1.732)=3*sqrt(2.732)\u22483*1.652\u22484.957. So d=10/4.957\u22482.017. Still not matching options.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / (h +k + l) * sqrt( (something) )\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought. Perhaps the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWhich is what I've been using. So perhaps the answer is 3.488, but the options don't have it. So perhaps the problem is about a hexagonal crystal, not rhombohedral. Or perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal, so that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the angles given are not all the same. The question says alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, so that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, and I should be using a different approach.\n\nWait, another approach: using the volume of the unit cell and the structure factor.\n\nThe volume of the unit cell (V) in a rhombohedral system is a^3 / (sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 \u03b1 + 2 cos^3 \u03b1 )).\n\nBut I'm not sure how that would help in finding the interplanar distance.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the reciprocal of d. Let me see: if d is about 3.488, then 1/d is about 0.286. But I don't see how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the Miller indices as (220) instead of (111). But the question specifies (111).\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct approach is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b1) )\n\nBut in that case, for \u03b1=30 degrees, the denominator would be 3 - 6*(0.866) =3-5.196= -2.196, which is negative. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I should instead use the angles as 180-30=150 degrees, so cos(150)= -0.866.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nDenominator= sqrt(3 +6*(-0.866))= sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). No, that's impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula, and the correct formula uses a different approach. Let me try to find another formula.\n\nWait, another source says that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWhich is the same as I've been using.\n\nSo, I think I'm correct in my approach, but the answer doesn't match the options. So perhaps there's a mistake in the question, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the angles given are the angles between the planes, not the lattice vectors. But I don't think that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut that would give a different result. Let me compute that.\n\nDenominator= sqrt(3) +6*(0.866)\u22481.732 +5.196=6.928.\n\nSo d=10/6.928\u22481.443. Still not matching.\n\nHmm. I'm not making progress. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the interatomic distance is along a different direction.\n\nWait, perhaps the interatomic distance given is along the [111] direction, which is the direction of the plane. So the distance between two atoms along [111] would be a multiplied by sqrt(3), because the [111] direction vector has components (1,1,1), so the length is sqrt(1^2 +1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(3). So interatomic distance along [111] is a*sqrt(3) =10 *1.732\u224817.32 Angstrom. But that's way larger than the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the face diagonal, which would be a*sqrt(2), but that's about 14.14 Angstrom, still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice, which is a, but that's 10 Angstrom, which is option D. But according to the formula, the (111) plane's interplanar distance is smaller than a, which is 10 Angstrom. So if option D is 10.05, it's close to a, but not matching the formula's result.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the distance between the planes, which is d, but perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator. So 1/2.863\u22480.3488, and 10 * 0.3488\u22483.488, same as before.\n\nBut no options match.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the formula in terms of the unit cell parameters differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWhich again gives the same result.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. According to all the sources I can recall, the formula I'm using is correct, but the answer doesn't match the options. So perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer isn't listed, but since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the (222) plane instead of (111). Let me compute that.\n\nh=k=l=2.\n\nDenominator= sqrt( (4+4+4) + 2*(4+4+4)*0.866 )\n\n= sqrt(12 + 24 *0.866 )\n\n24 *0.866 \u224820.784.\n\n12 +20.784=32.784.\n\nsqrt(32.784)=5.726.\n\nSo d=10/5.726\u22481.746 Angstrom. Still not matching options.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different and the correct denominator is sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 ), but that gives negative values.\n\nWait, perhaps I should accept that I'm not getting the correct answer and perhaps the correct option is not listed, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, and the correct approach is different.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the interplanar distance formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWhich I've been using, but perhaps the angles given are not the same as the ones used in the formula. For example, perhaps the formula uses the angle between the planes, not the lattice vectors.\n\nWait, but I don't think that's the case. The angles in the formula are the angles between the lattice vectors.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I should proceed with the calculation as per the formula and see if any of the options match when considering possible calculation errors.\n\nWait, 3.488 Angstrom is approximately 3.5, which is not in the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's not an option here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the initial formula.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWhich would give denominator sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.\n\nHmm. I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to go with the calculation I have, even though it doesn't match any of the options.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial problem statement. The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is not a, but something else. For example, in a face-centered cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a\u221a2/2, but in a simple cubic, it's a.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance along the (111) direction, which is a\u221a3. So if a\u221a3=10, then a=10/\u221a3\u22485.7735 Angstrom.\n\nWait, that could change things. Let me try that.\n\nSo if a=10/\u221a3 \u22485.7735, then the denominator is sqrt(3 +6*(0.866))=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.\n\nSo d= a / 2.863 \u22485.7735 /2.863 \u22482.017 Angstrom. Still not matching options.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (100) direction, so a=10.\n\nBut then the earlier calculation holds.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find a way to get an answer matching the options. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct approach gives one of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recompute the denominator.\n\nWait, denominator is sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2))=sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, 3*sqrt(3) is approximately 5.196, so 3+5.196=8.196. So sqrt(8.196)=2.863. So d=10/2.863\u22483.488.\n\nBut none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest one is option B)8.95, which is about three times larger.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the inverse of the denominator, but that would give 2.863, which is much smaller than the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute 10 divided by (1/sqrt(8.196))=10 * 2.863\u224828.63, which is way too large.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that according to the formula, the correct answer is approximately 3.488 Angstrom, which is not listed, but perhaps there's an error in the problem statement or the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the formula in terms of reciprocal lattice vectors, but I don't think that would change the outcome.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct option is C)9.54 Angstrom. How could that happen?\n\nLet me see: if the denominator were approximately 1.048, then 10/1.048\u22489.54.\n\nSo how could the denominator be 1.048?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me try to find another formula.\n\nWait, another approach: The interplanar distance can also be found using the volume of the unit cell and the reciprocal of the structure factor.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut that would give d=10 /8.196\u22481.220 Angstrom, which is not matching.\n\nHmm. I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to go with the calculation as per the formula I know, even though it doesn't match any of the options. But since the options don't include 3.488, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut that would give a negative denominator, which is impossible.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to proceed with the calculation as per the formula I know, even though it doesn't match any of the options.\n\n\nTo determine the interplanar distance \\( d \\) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \\cos \\alpha}}\n\\]\n\n### Given Data:\n- Interatomic distance \\( a = 10 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\)\n- Miller indices \\( h = 1, k = 1, l = 1 \\)\n- Crystal angles \\( \\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 30^\\circ \\)\n- \\( \\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866 \\)\n\n### Calculation:\n1. **Numerator**: \\( a = 10 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\).\n\n2. **Denominator**:\n   - \\( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 \\),\n   - \\( 2(hk + hl + kl) = 2(1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1) = 6 \\),\n   - \\( 2(hk + hl + kl) \\cos \\alpha = 6 \\cdot 0.866 = 5.196 \\),\n   - Total under the square root: \\( 3 + 5.196 = 8.196 \\),\n   - \\( \\sqrt{8.196} \\approx 2.863 \\).\n\n3. **Interplanar distance**:\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{10}{2.863} \\approx 3.488 \\, \\text{\u00c5}.\n   \\]\n\n### Analysis of Options:\nThe calculated interplanar distance \\( d \\approx 3.488 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9\u201310 \u00c5.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all its edges equal but the angles between them can vary. Wait, the problem says the angles \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are all 30 degrees. So it's a special case where all the angles are the same. That must mean it's a rhombohedral structure with each angle being 30 degrees.\n\nThe interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms, which in a crystal structure would be the lattice parameter 'a'. So I think a = 10 Angstrom here.\n\nThe question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos \u03b1 + cos \u03b2 + cos \u03b3) / (1 + ... something) ) )\n\nWait, maybe I should recall the exact formula. Oh, wait, no, I think I'm mixing some terms. The correct formula for the interplanar spacing in a crystal with non-orthogonal axes is a bit more involved. Oh right, the general formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - a (h k cos \u03b3 + h l cos \u03b2 + k l cos \u03b1 )) ) / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)^2 - 2(h^2k^2 + h^2l^2 + k^2l^2) + 2(hkl)(hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b1 )) )) )\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, I've heard that for a rhombohedral system where a = b = c and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3, the formula simplifies. Maybe there's a simpler expression.\n\nWait, perhaps using the relation involving the unit cell volume and the reciprocal lattice vectors. Another approach: The interplanar distance d is related to the reciprocal of the plane's Miller indices. The formula is d = 1/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * (sin^2 \u03b1 + sin^2 \u03b2 + sin^2 \u03b3) - 2 (hk cos(\u03b1 - \u03b2) + hl cos(\u03b1 - \u03b3) + kl cos(\u03b2 - \u03b3)) )) ) * a.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. Another formula I remember is for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b3 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because if all angles are the same, then the formula might involve cos \u03b3 multiplied by each pair. Let me think about the structure factor or the metric tensor approach.\n\nThe metric tensor for a rhombohedral crystal where a=b=c and \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3 is:\n\nThe diagonal elements are a\u00b2, and the off-diagonal elements are a\u00b2 cos \u03b1. So the metric tensor [d_{ij}] is:\n\nd_{11} = a\u00b2, d_{22} = a\u00b2, d_{33} = a\u00b2,\n\nd_{12} = d_{21} = a\u00b2 cos \u03b1,\n\nd_{13} = d_{31} = a\u00b2 cos \u03b1,\n\nd_{23} = d_{32} = a\u00b2 cos \u03b1.\n\nThe interplanar distance formula is derived from the reciprocal of the plane's indices. The formula for d^2 is given by:\n\n(1/d^2) = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) / a\u00b2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) (cos \u03b1) / a\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nd^2 = a\u00b2 / [ (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 ]\n\nTherefore, d = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nIn our case, the plane is (111), so h = k = l = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nd^2 = a\u00b2 / [1 + 1 + 1 - 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) cos 30\u00b0 ]\n\nLet me compute the denominator.\n\nFirst, the sum h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\nThen, the other term: 2(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1 + 1 + 1) = 6.\n\nSo the denominator is 3 - 6 * cos(30\u00b0).\n\nWait, wait, the formula I have is denominator: (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1.\n\nSo with h=k=l=1, this becomes 3 - 2*(3) * cos(30\u00b0).\n\nWait, 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) = 2*(3) =6. So 3 -6 cos30.\n\nWhat's cos30\u00b0? It's sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660.\n\nSo denominator: 3 -6*(0.8660) = 3 -5.196= -2.196.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because denominator is negative, which would make d^2 negative, which isn't possible. Hmm, that can't be correct.\n\nWait, did I get the formula wrong? Because in a rhombohedral system, it's possible that the denominator becomes negative, leading to an imaginary d. Which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is:\n\nd^2 = (a^2) / [ (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) - 2 (hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b3 + kl cos \u03b3) ]\n\nWait, no, that's the same as before. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I should be using cos(180 - \u03b1) or something else? No, I think the angles are given as 30 degrees, so I should use cos 30.\n\nWait, but in this case, 3 -6*(0.866) = 3 -5.196= -2.196. So sqrt(-2.196) would be imaginary, which is impossible. So perhaps I must have made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 + 2 (h +k + l)^2 (1 - cos \u03b1) ) )\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula. Oh wait, but I'm just thinking here. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the volume of the unit cell and the plane.\n\nWait, another approach: the volume V of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos \u03b1 + 3 cos^3 \u03b1)/2.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps with the interplanar distance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reciprocal of d^2 is (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2)/(a^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl)/(a^2) cos \u03b1.\n\nWait, but that's the same formula as before. So with h=k=l=1, the denominator becomes 3 -6 cos \u03b1. Which for \u03b1=30\u00b0, 3 -6*(\u221a3/2) = 3 -3\u221a3 \u2248 3 -5.196= -2.196.\n\nNegative, which is impossible. So that must mean I have the wrong formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have a negative sign in the formula? Or maybe the formula is:\n\nd^2 = (a^2) / [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 ]\n\nWait, but that would make denominator 3 +6*(0.866) =3 +5.196=8.196. So d^2=100/(8.196)= ~12.196. Then d= sqrt(12.196) \u22483.492 Angstrom. But that's not one of the options. The options are around 9 Angstrom.\n\nWait, that's way too small. The given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, but the interplanar distance is smaller? Hmm, wait, no, sometimes planes can have smaller distances. But according to the options, the answer is around 9 Angstrom, which is close to 10. So perhaps that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Another thought: the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system can also be calculated using:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (3 cos \u03b1 - 1) )\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd^2 = (a^2) / [ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos \u03b1 + cos \u03b2 + cos \u03b3) ]\n\nBut since \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30\u00b0, this becomes:\n\nd^2 = a\u00b2 / [ 3 - 3 * (cos30) ]\n\nSo denominator = 3 -3*(sqrt(3)/2) \u22483 - 2.598=0.402.\n\nSo d\u00b2= (10)^2 / 0.402 \u2248 100 /0.402 \u2248248.756.\n\nSo d\u2248sqrt(248.756) \u224815.77 Angstrom. That's way too big, and not an option.\n\nHmm, something's wrong here. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, another approach: For a simple cubic structure (which rhombohedral is not, but just for reference), the interplanar distance is a/sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2). For (111), it would be a/sqrt(3) \u224810 /1.732\u22485.77 Angstrom. But that's not matching the options either.\n\nWait, maybe for a rhombohedral system, the formula is different. Oh! I think I found the correct formula. The correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWait, but earlier that gave a negative denominator. Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong sign. Maybe it's:\n\nd^2 = a\u00b2 / [ (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 ]\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nSo, with h=k=l=1, cos \u03b1 = cos30=\u221a3/2\u22480.866.\n\nDenominator: 3 + 6*0.866 \u22483 +5.196=8.196.\n\nd\u00b2= (10)^2 /8.196 \u2248100/8.196\u224812.196. So d\u22483.49 Angstrom.\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options. The options are 8-10 Angstrom.\n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I should think in terms of the Miller indices and the angles.\n\nWait, another thought: The interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b3 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nWait, that's similar to what I thought earlier. Let me compute the denominator again.\n\nh=k=l=1, so:\n\n3 - 2*( (1*1 * cos30) + (1*1 * cos30) + (1*1 * cos30) )\n\nWhich is 3 - 2*(3 * 0.866)\n\n3 - 6*0.866 = 3 -5.196= -2.196.\n\nAgain negative. So that's impossible. So maybe this formula is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the rhombohedral lattice. In a rhombohedral system, all edges are equal and all angles are equal. The reciprocal lattice vectors can be used to find the interplanar distance.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:\n\ng_hkl = (h a + k b cos \u03b3 + l c cos \u03b2 ) i + ... etc. But that might be getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters.\n\nWait, another formula I found before is:\n\nd_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b1) ) * (1/a)\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nBut in this case, since \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30\u00b0, it's:\n\nd^2 = a\u00b2 / [ 3 - 2*( (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 ) ]\n\nSo denominator: 3 - 6 cos30.\n\nWhich is 3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196.\n\nAgain, same problem. Negative. So perhaps the formula is wrong, or perhaps I'm missing a negative sign somewhere.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the formula is actually:\n\nd^2 = (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 ) / a^2.\n\nWait, no, that's the same as before but inverted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal lattice vector. The reciprocal lattice vector g is given by:\n\ng^2 = (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) a^2 - 2 (hk a^2 cos \u03b3 + hl a^2 cos \u03b2 + kl a^2 cos \u03b1 )\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think about the metric tensor approach.\n\nThe metric tensor (in real space) is:\n\n[ a^2, a^2 cos \u03b3, a^2 cos \u03b2 ]\n\n[ a^2 cos \u03b3, a^2, a^2 cos \u03b1 ]\n\n[ a^2 cos \u03b2, a^2 cos \u03b1, a^2 ]\n\nThe reciprocal metric tensor (in reciprocal space) is the inverse of this. The (hkl) plane corresponds to the reciprocal lattice vector g = h i + k j + l k. The magnitude squared is g \u00b7 g = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3).\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's:\n\ng\u00b2 = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3 )\n\nSo, for our case, with \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30\u00b0, and h=k=l=1,\n\ng\u00b2 = 3 - 2*(3 * cos30 )\n\nWhich is 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3) \u2248 3 -5.196= -2.196.\n\nNegative again. So g\u00b2 is negative, which is impossible. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\ng\u00b2 = (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3 )\n\nWait, but that's what I did before. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let's think about the unit cell. The volume V is a^3 / (sqrt(1 - 3 cos \u03b1 + 3 cos^3 \u03b1 )) ). Wait, but I'm not sure how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (3 cos \u03b1 - 1) )\n\nWait, let's try that. So denominator is 3 - (3) * (3 cos30 -1 )\n\nSo, 3 -3*( 3*(0.866) -1 )\n\n=3 -3*(2.598 -1)=3 -3*(1.598)=3-4.794= -1.794.\n\nAgain negative. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a negative sign in the formula. Suppose the formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nThen, denominator is 3 +6*(0.866)=3 +5.196=8.196.\n\nd=10/sqrt(8.196)\u224810/2.863\u22483.49 Angstrom. But that's not matching the options.\n\nWait, the options are all around 9 Angstrom, which is close to the lattice parameter a=10. So perhaps the interplanar distance is about 9 Angstrom. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe I should use the Miller indices (111) and compute the interplanar distance using the formula for a face-centered cubic structure. Wait, no, rhombohedral is a different structure.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the rhombohedral system as a special case of a hexagonal system. No, hexagonal is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a cubic system but adjust it for the angles. But that might not work.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's calculate the reciprocal of the interplanar distance, which is given by the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. The reciprocal lattice vector for (111) is given by:\n\ng = (1/a)(2\u03c0) ( h a_x + k a_y + l a_z )\n\nBut I'm not sure about the vectors a_x, a_y, a_z.\n\nAlternatively, the reciprocal lattice vector is given by:\n\ng = (h i + k j + l k) / ( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )^(1/2)\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the magnitude of g, which is 1/d.\n\nSo, |g| = 1/d = sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) ) / a\n\nSo, 1/d = sqrt(3 - 6 cos30\u00b0 ) / 10\n\nCompute sqrt(3 -6*(0.866))= sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196)= imaginary. So that's impossible. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Perhaps the correct formula is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2)/a\u00b2 - 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3)/a\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n1/d\u00b2 = [3 -6 *0.866 ] / (10)^2\n\n= (3 -5.196)/100= (-2.196)/100= -0.02196\n\nBut that's negative, which can't be. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.\n\nHmm. Maybe the formula for d is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut again, that gives a negative denominator.\n\nWait, perhaps the angles are 180-30=150 degrees? No, the question says 30 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula uses cos(180-\u03b1), which would be -cos \u03b1. Let me try that.\n\nSo, if the formula uses cos(180-30)= -cos30.\n\nSo, denominator: 3 -6*(-0.866)=3 +5.196=8.196.\n\nd=10/sqrt(8.196)\u224810/2.863\u22483.49 Angstrom. Again, not matching.\n\nWait, but the options are all around 9, which is close to a=10. So maybe the plane (111) has a spacing close to a.\n\nBut according to the formula I tried, it's about 3.49, which is much smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Maybe the denominator is (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1.\n\nSo,\n\n3 +6*(0.866)=3+5.196=8.196. d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the formula is different. Maybe it's:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWait, that would give the same denominator as before, 8.196, same result.\n\nSo I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative formula.\n\nAnother approach: The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:\n\nd = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (2)(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 ) )\n\nBut in this case, the denominator is negative. So perhaps the formula is actually:\n\nd = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos (180 - \u03b1) ) )\n\nSince cos(180 - \u03b1)= -cos \u03b1.\n\nSo,\n\ndenominator=3 -2*3*(-cos30)=3 +6*(0.866)=3+5.196=8.196.\n\nSo, d=10/sqrt(8.196)\u22483.49 Angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) (3 cos \u03b1 -1) )\n\nSo,\n\ndenominator=3 -3*(3*(0.866) -1 )=3 -3*(2.598-1)=3-3*(1.598)=3-4.794= -1.794.\n\nAgain negative. So that's not working.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of d. Let's think about it.\n\nIf d is the interplanar distance, then (1/d)^2 equals the sum of (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/(a^2) minus twice the sum of the products hk cos \u03b1 etc. But that brings us back to the same problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong sign for the angles. Wait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd^2 = a\u00b2 [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 ]^{-1}\n\nBut that's the same as before.\n\nWait, maybe the formula should have a negative sign in the denominator:\n\nd^2 = a\u00b2 / [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 ]\n\nWhich would give us d=10/sqrt(3+6*0.866)=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49.\n\nBut that's not matching any options.\n\nWait, the options are all around 9 Angstrom, which is close to 10. So perhaps I'm missing something in the formula.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the formula is d= a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) ) when the angles are 90 degrees, but when they're not, it's different.\n\nWait, for a cubic system (\u03b1=90\u00b0), (111) plane would have d = a/sqrt(3) \u22485.77 Angstrom. But that's not the case here.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the volume of the unit cell and then find the volume of the parallelepiped. The volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos \u03b1 + 3 cos^3 \u03b1 ) / something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut as earlier, this leads to a negative denominator. So perhaps the angles are given as 150 degrees instead of 30? Because cos(150) is -sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWait, the problem states \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30\u00b0, so that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 + 6 (h +k +l) (cos \u03b1)^2 )\n\nWait, I'm making this up, but perhaps I should try. Let's see:\n\nh=k=l=1, so:\n\n3 - 6*(0.866) +6*(3)*(0.866)^2.\n\nCompute:\n\n3 -5.196 +6*3*(0.75).\n\n= 3 -5.196 +6*3*0.75=3-5.196 +13.5= (3+13.5) -5.196=16.5-5.196=11.304.\n\nd=10/sqrt(11.304)=10/3.36\u22482.976 Angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 + 6 cos^2 \u03b1 )\n\nWait, but that's a guess.\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n3 -6*(0.866) +6*(0.866)^2.\n\n=3 -5.196 +6*(0.75)=3-5.196+4.5= (3+4.5) -5.196=7.5-5.196=2.304.\n\nd=10/sqrt(2.304)=10/1.518\u22486.586 Angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut that gives a negative denominator. So perhaps the angles in the formula are in radians or something. No, that's not the case.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the reciprocal of d squared as:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = [ (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l^2) / a\u00b2 ] - [ 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 / a\u00b2 ]\n\nBut that leads to negative 1/d\u00b2, which is impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the inverse of the metric tensor.\n\nThe metric tensor for the real space is:\n\nG = [ [a\u00b2, a\u00b2 cos \u03b1, a\u00b2 cos \u03b1 ],\n       [a\u00b2 cos \u03b1, a\u00b2, a\u00b2 cos \u03b1 ],\n       [a\u00b2 cos \u03b1, a\u00b2 cos \u03b1, a\u00b2 ] ]\n\nThe reciprocal metric tensor G* is the inverse of G. The (hkl) plane corresponds to the reciprocal vector g = h i + k j + l k.\n\nThe magnitude squared of g is g \u00b7 g = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. So if the magnitude squared is negative, that's impossible, which suggests that perhaps the given angles are such that no such plane exists. But the problem gives the angles as 30 degrees, so I must proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the reciprocal lattice vector.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\ng\u00b2 = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut in our case, all angles are 30\u00b0, so:\n\ng\u00b2 = 3 - 2*( 3 * cos30 )=3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196.\n\nAgain, negative.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the rhombohedral angles are such that the plane (111) does not exist. But the problem is asking for the interplanar distance, so it must exist.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the magnitude using the absolute value. So,\n\nd = a / sqrt( |3 -6 cos30| )\n\n=10 / sqrt(5.196 -3 )=10/sqrt(2.196)\u224810/1.481\u22486.74 Angstrom.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nWait, the options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is around 9 Angstrom.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the reciprocal of the denominator as (3 -6 cos \u03b1) =3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3-3*sqrt(3)=3-5.196= -2.196. So the denominator is negative. So perhaps the correct approach is to take the absolute value.\n\nSo,\n\nd= a / sqrt( |3 -6 cos30| )\n\n=10 / sqrt(5.196 -3 )=10/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.481\u22486.74 Angstrom.\n\nBut that's not matching any options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute using the inverse of the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd^2 = (a^2) / [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 ]\n\nWhich for h=k=l=1:\n\ndenominator=3 +6*(0.866)=8.196.\n\nd=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49 Angstrom.\n\nBut that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the interplanar distance is the same as the lattice parameter because (111) is a close-packed plane. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula. Maybe the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (h +k +l)(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWait, for h=k=l=1:\n\n= 3 - 2*(3)(3) cos30.\n\n=3- 18*(0.866)=3-15.588= -12.588.\n\nNo, that's worse.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should give up and look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the interplanar distance is the same as the lattice parameter because the plane is (111) and in a cubic system, but no, the angles here are 30 degrees, not 90.\n\nWait, another idea: The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos (180 - \u03b1) )\n\nSince cos(180-\u03b1) = -cos \u03b1.\n\nSo,\n\ndenominator=3 -6*(-0.866)=3+5.196=8.196.\n\nd=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49 Angstrom.\n\nBut again, not matching.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to look up the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.\n\nUpon checking my notes, I find that the correct formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut in this case, the denominator becomes negative, which is impossible. So perhaps the given angles are such that this leads to a negative denominator, implying that the (111) plane doesn't exist in this crystal structure. But the question is asking for the interplanar distance, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute using the correct formula, and the result is the imaginary number, which suggests that such a plane does not exist. But that's not an option here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the angles are 120 degrees instead of 30, which would make the denominator positive.\n\nWait, if \u03b1=120\u00b0, then cos \u03b1= -0.5.\n\nDenominator:3 -6*(-0.5)=3+3=6.\n\nd=10/sqrt(6)=10/2.449\u22484.082 Angstrom. Still not matching options.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the denominator as 3 -6*(cos 30\u00b0 ), which is 3 -5.196= -2.196. So take the absolute value:\n\nd=10/sqrt(2.196)=6.74 Angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nWait, but the options are around 9, which is close to a=10. So perhaps the formula is different.\n\nAnother approach: The interplanar distance can be calculated using the plane's normal vector. The normal vector for (111) is (1,1,1). The length of this vector in reciprocal space is sqrt(1 +1 +1 - 2*(1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 ))=sqrt(3 -6*0.866)=sqrt(-2.196). Imaginary. So the plane (111) doesn't exist in this structure. But the question asks for it, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angles are 60 degrees. Let me try that.\n\nIf \u03b1=60, cos60=0.5.\n\nDenominator:3 -6*(0.5)=3-3=0.\n\nd approaches infinity. Not possible.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWhich gives 3 +6*(0.866)=8.196. d=3.49.\n\nBut the options don't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom, which is about 10 divided by sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + something )\n\nWait, 10 / sqrt( (3) + ... )=9.54.\n\nWait, sqrt( (3) + ... )=10/9.54\u22481.048.\n\nSo,\n\n3 + something = (1.048)^2\u22481.098.\n\nSo,\n\nsomething=1.098-3= -1.902.\n\nBut that's negative, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute 10 / sqrt( (3) - (something) )=9.54.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3 - x )=10/9.54\u22481.048.\n\nSo,\n\n3 -x=1.098.\n\nx=3 -1.098=1.902.\n\nSo,\n\ndenominator=3 -1.902=1.098.\n\nHmm, but I don't know what x represents. Perhaps it's 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 =1.902.\n\nSo,\n\n2*(3) cos \u03b1 =1.902 \u2192 6 cos \u03b1 =1.902 \u2192 cos \u03b1=0.317.\n\nSo \u03b1\u224871.5 degrees. But the problem states \u03b1=30\u00b0, so this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. I think I must have made a mistake in the formula, but I can't figure it out. Given the options, the closest I can get to 9.54 is if the denominator is approximately 1.048^2=1.098.\n\nWait, 10 / sqrt( (3) - (something) )=9.54.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3 - x )=10/9.54\u22481.048.\n\nSo,\n\n3 -x= (1.048)^2=1.098.\n\nx=3-1.098=1.902.\n\nSo,\n\n3 -1.902=1.098.\n\nSo,\n\ndenominator=1.098.\n\nSo,\n\n(h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 =1.098.\n\nWhich for h=k=l=1:\n\n3 -6 cos \u03b1=1.098 \u2192 6 cos \u03b1=3 -1.098=1.902 \u2192 cos \u03b1=0.317.\n\nSo \u03b1\u224871.5\u00b0, but the problem says 30\u00b0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the absolute value of the denominator.\n\nSo,\n\nd=10/sqrt( |3 -6 cos30| )=10/sqrt(5.196-3)=10/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.481\u22486.74 Angstrom.\n\nBut that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is:\n\nd^2 = (a\u00b2 (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) ) / ( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut for our case, this gives a negative denominator. So perhaps the formula is incorrect, or the problem has a mistake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom, but I can't see how. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, another idea: The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos (180 - \u03b1) )\n\nSince cos(180-\u03b1) = -cos \u03b1.\n\nSo,\n\ndenominator=3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196.\n\nAgain, same problem.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe the interplanar distance is a multiplied by the inverse of the square root of (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l^2), but that's for cubic systems. So for (111), d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 Angstrom, which isn't an option.\n\nBut the options are around 9, which is close to a=10. So perhaps the plane (111) is a very close-packed plane, leading to a larger interplanar distance. Wait, that doesn't make sense because (111) is a close-packed plane in cubic systems, leading to smaller d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to a primitive unit cell, but I'm not sure.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom. Let me try to compute that.\n\n9.54^2 = about 91.\n\nSo,\n\nd^2 = a\u00b2 / denominator \u2192 denominator= a\u00b2 /d\u00b2 =100/91\u22481.0989.\n\nSo,\n\ndenominator=1.0989.\n\nSo,\n\n3 -6 cos30 =1.0989 \u2192 cos30= (3 -1.0989)/(6)= (1.9011)/(6)=0.31685.\n\nWhich is about 71.5 degrees, not 30. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos (alpha) )\n\nBut for our case, that gives a negative denominator. So perhaps the formula is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I think I must have made a mistake in the formula. I'll have to go with the given options and see which one fits.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nBut since the denominator is negative, perhaps the correct approach is to take the absolute value.\n\nSo,\n\nd=10/sqrt(5.196-3)=10/sqrt(2.196)=approx6.74 Angstrom.\n\nBut that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWhich gives d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49 Angstrom. Not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nWell, I'm stuck. Given the options, I'll have to make an educated guess. Since the problem gives a=10 Angstrom, and the options are all close to 9, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Another approach: Perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos \u03b1 + cos \u03b2 + cos \u03b3) )\n\nSince all angles are 30\u00b0, cos30=0.866.\n\nSo,\n\ndenominator=3 -3*(0.866)=3-2.598=0.402.\n\nd=10/sqrt(0.402)=10/0.634\u224815.77 Angstrom. Not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - (hk + hl + kl) * 3 cos \u03b1 )\n\nSo,\n\ndenominator=3 -3*(3 *0.866 )=3-7.794= -4.794.\n\nAgain, negative.\n\nHmm.\n\nWell, I think I've exhausted all possible approaches. Given the options, I'll have to choose the closest one, which is option C)9.54 Angstrom.\n\n\nTo determine the interplanar distance \\( d_{hkl} \\) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \\( a = 10 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\) and angles \\( \\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 30^\\circ \\), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) \\cos \\alpha}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Substitute the given values\nFor the (111) plane, \\( h = k = l = 1 \\), and \\( \\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866 \\). Substituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) - 2(1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1) \\cos 30^\\circ}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the denominator\nThe numerator of the denominator is:\n\\[\nh^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3\n\\]\n\nThe second term in the denominator is:\n\\[\n2(hk + hl + kl) \\cos 30^\\circ = 2(1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1) \\cos 30^\\circ = 6 \\cdot 0.866 = 5.196\n\\]\n\nThus, the denominator becomes:\n\\[\n3 - 5.196 = -2.196\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the result\nThe denominator is negative, which is physically impossible for an interplanar distance. This suggests that the given angles (\\( \\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 30^\\circ \\)) may not allow the (111) plane to exist in this crystal structure. However, since the question explicitly asks for the interplanar distance, an approximate calculation is performed by taking the absolute value of the denominator:\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{|-2.196|}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2.196}} \\approx \\frac{10}{1.481} \\approx 6.74 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the options\nThe calculated value (\\( \\approx 6.74 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\)) does not match any of the provided options, which are all close to 9 \u00c5. Given the mismatch, it is possible that the formula or the interpretation of the angles may differ. Based on the options, the closest plausible answer is:\n\n**C) 9.54 \u00c5**\n\n### Final Answer:\nC) 9.54 \u00c5",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given data includes the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are 30 degrees. \n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. I'm getting a bit confused. Rhombohedral crystal... Oh right, rhombohedral is one of the crystal systems. I remember that in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are equal (a = b = c) and the angles between them are all the same, which they are here at 30 degrees each.\n\nSo the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. I think interatomic distance refers to the lattice parameter 'a' in this case because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the same as 'a'. But wait, rhombohedral is a bit more complex than cubic, but since all edges are the same, maybe 'a' is 10 Angstroms. So a = 10 A.\n\nWe need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The interplanar distance d is given by the formula from the Bragg's law setup. The formula is d = a / sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk cos \u03b3) + 2(hl cos \u03b2) + 2(kl cos \u03b1)) ), but wait, I'm not sure if I remember that correctly. Alternatively, I've heard that for a rhombohedral system, there's a simplified formula because all angles are equal.\n\nWait, let me think. The general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is:\n\nd_{hkl} = [ (a\u00b2 (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2 a\u00b2 (hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b1) )^(-1/2) ].\n\nBut in a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3, this simplifies. Let me try to plug in the values.\n\nSo \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 30\u00b0, and a = 10 A. The plane is (111), so h = 1, k = 1, l =1.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the formula. Let me double-check. Oh right, another version of the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos \u03b3) + 2(hl cos \u03b2) + 2(kl cos \u03b1) ) )\n\nWait, but wait\u2014since \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are all 30 degrees, the formula becomes:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2 (hk cos 30\u00b0 + hl cos 30\u00b0 + kl cos 30\u00b0) )\n\nSo for (111), h=k=l=1. So let's compute the denominator.\n\nFirst, compute each term:\n\nh\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 = 1 + 1 +1 =3.\n\nThen, 2 (hk cos 30 + hl cos30 + kl cos30) \n\nSince hk = 1*1 =1, same for hl and kl. So each term is cos30\u00b0, which is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660.\n\nSo each of the three terms is 1 * 0.8660, and multiplied by 2, so 2*(0.8660 +0.8660 +0.8660) = 2*(2.598) \u22485.196.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, 1*1=1, so each term in the 2*(...) is 1*0.866, so adding three of them gives 3*0.866 = 2.598. Multiply by 2 gives 5.196.\n\nSo the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 +5.196 =8.196.\n\nSo d = a / sqrt(8.196). a is 10, so 10 / sqrt(8.196).\n\nWhat's sqrt(8.196)? Let me compute that. Let's see, 2.86 squared is about 8.18 (since 2.86^2 = (2.8)^2 + 2*2.8*0.06 + (0.06)^2) = 7.84 + 0.336 + 0.0036=8.1796. So sqrt(8.196) \u2248 2.862.\n\nSo d \u224810 / 2.862 \u2248 3.493 A. Wait, that can't be right because the options are all around 9 or 10. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait a second. Maybe I mixed up the formula. Oh! Wait, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is different. Another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b8 ), where \u03b8 is the angle between the axes. Since all angles are same, \u03b8=30 degrees.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, the general formula is:\n\nd^2 = (a^2 (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2a\u00b2 (hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b1)) ) / ( (h + k + l)^2 )\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the formula for a rhombohedral crystal's interplanar distance.\n\nWait, another approach: The interplanar spacing for a rhombohedral system can be expressed as:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(\u03b8) )\n\nWhere \u03b8 is the angle between the crystallographic axes. Since in this case, \u03b8=30 degrees.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think. For a rhombohedral system, the metric tensor is such that a = b = c, and all angles are equal. So the formula might indeed simplify to that.\n\nSo for (111), h=k=l=1.\n\nSo compute the denominator: h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 =3.\n\nThen, 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8.\n\nhk =1, hl=1, kl=1. So 2*(3) cos30\u00b0.\n\nWhich is 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3) \u22485.196.\n\nSo denominator is sqrt(3 +5.196) = sqrt(8.196) \u22482.862.\n\nSo d = a / 2.862 = 10 / 2.862 \u22483.493 A.\n\nBut the options are around 8-10, so this can't be right. Hmm. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Oh! Wait, I think I forgot that the formula actually has (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2(hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b1)). Wait, but in this case, all cosines are the same, so it's 3 cos30.\n\nWait, wait, let me recompute.\n\nDenominator inside sqrt: 3 + 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30).\n\nWait, that's 3 + 2*(3 * (sqrt(3)/2)) )= 3 + 2*( (3 * 0.866)/1 )= 3 + 2*(2.598) =3 +5.196=8.196.\n\nSo sqrt(8.196) is about 2.862, so d=10/2.862\u22483.493 A.\n\nBut the options are all around 9, so perhaps I messed up the formula. Alternatively, maybe the interatomic distance isn't a. Wait, wait, what's the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral structure?\n\nWait, perhaps the interatomic distance refers to the distance between two adjacent atoms, which in a simple cubic structure would be a. But in a rhombohedral structure, maybe it's different because of the angles. Hmm, no. Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameter is a, and the interatomic distance is the same as in a cubic structure because it's still based on the cube edges. But wait, no\u2014rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal close-packed? No, I'm getting confused again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I used is correct, but the options are way off. So perhaps I messed up the formula. Alternatively, maybe the interplanar distance for (111) is larger than a, which doesn't make sense, so perhaps I inverted the formula.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I should compute the reciprocal lattice vector or something else, but that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula for interplanar distance is d = a / (sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b1)) ), which is what I used. So for (111), that's 3 + 2*(3 * cos30) )=3 + 2*(3*(sqrt(3)/2))=3+3*sqrt(3)= 3+5.196=8.196. So sqrt(8.196) is about 2.862, so d=10/2.862 \u22483.493 Angstroms.\n\nBut none of the options are near 3.5. The options are all around 9. So I must have made a mistake. Hmm. Maybe I got the formula wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal of the formula. Or maybe I confused the formula with the one for the unit cell volume.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the interatomic distance isn't a. Let me think: in a rhombohedral structure, the distance between two atoms along the a, b, c axes is a. But if the structure is not simple cubic, maybe the interatomic distance is different. Wait, but in a simple rhombohedral structure (like NaCl?), but no, NaCl is face-centered cubic.\n\nWait, perhaps the interatomic distance refers to the distance between nearest neighbors, which in a cubic system is a. But in a rhombohedral system, maybe the nearest neighbors are arranged differently, so the interatomic distance isn't a. Hmm, but in this case, the given interatomic distance is 10 A, so perhaps a is something else.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different. Let me think about the general formula again.\n\nThe general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is:\n\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) + 2 hk cos \u03b3/(ab) + 2 hl cos \u03b2/(ac) + 2 kl cos \u03b1/(bc) ) } }\n\nIn a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=\u03b8=30\u00b0, so this simplifies.\n\nSo substituting a = b = c, and cos \u03b1 = cos \u03b2 = cos \u03b3 = cos30\u00b0.\n\nSo,\n\nd_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos30\u00b0 / (a\u00b2) )\n\n= 1/ sqrt( [ (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos30 ] / a\u00b2 )\n\n= a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos30 )\n\nSo this brings me back to the same formula I used earlier. So for (111), h=k=l=1.\n\nSo denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 2*(3)(sqrt(3)/2) )=3 + 3*sqrt(3) \u22483 +5.196=8.196. So sqrt(8.196)= ~2.862.\n\nSo d = a / 2.862.\n\nBut a is given as the interatomic distance, which is 10 A. So d=10/2.862\u22483.493 A.\n\nBut none of the options are near that. So I'm either making a mistake in the formula or in understanding the question.\n\nWait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 A. Oh wait, maybe 'interatomic distance' refers to the distance between two atoms along the diagonal of the rhombohedral unit cell, not the lattice parameter a.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighbors, which in a cubic system is a. But in rhombohedral, it could be the same as a, but maybe the formula is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the lattice parameter a with the unit cell parameter. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as a in this case, which is 10 A.\n\nBut then, according to the calculation, the interplanar distance is ~3.49 A, which is way below the options given.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider that the formula is inverted. Or perhaps I have the reciprocal in the formula wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the formula is correct as d = a / sqrt(...). So perhaps the given interatomic distance isn't a, but perhaps the a in the formula is not the same as the given interatomic distance. Wait, maybe the question is using a different approach, like in a face-centered cubic structure, but no, it's a rhombohedral crystal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator. Wait, but that would make d very small, which doesn't fit the options either.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the reciprocal of d. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the denominator should be 3 + 2*(hk + hl + kl) * cos\u03b8, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's compute the denominator correctly.\n\nDenominator = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2 (hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b1 )\n\nSince h=k=l=1, and all angles are 30 degrees.\n\nSo, h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 =3.\n\nThe cross terms: hk=1, so 2 hk cos\u03b3 = 2 *1* (sqrt(3)/2) )=sqrt(3). Same for each of the three terms (hl and kl). So total cross terms: 3 * sqrt(3) \u22485.196.\n\nSo denominator is 3 +5.196 =8.196.\n\nSo sqrt(8.196) \u22482.862.\n\nd= a/2.862.\n\nBut a is 10, so d=10/2.862 \u22483.493 A.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options, which are all around 9. So I must have messed up something.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the formula for the interplanar distance is d = a * sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )^(-1) ), but that's what I've been using.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the denominator. Wait, no. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about a rhombohedral lattice but a hexagonal or cubic one. But the question states it's rhombohedral.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the volume of the unit cell and use that somehow. But I don't see how that would help directly.\n\nWait, another thought: What if the interatomic distance is along the diagonal, not the edge. Like, the distance between atoms along the (111) direction? But I don't think that's what the question is asking. It's about the interplanar distance, which is the spacing between planes.\n\nWait, maybe I should try plugging the numbers again to see if I messed up.\n\nWait, the denominator inside the sqrt is 8.196. So sqrt(8.196)= about 2.862.\n\nSo 10 /2.862= approximately 3.493 Angstroms.\n\nWait, but the options are all in the 8-10 range. So that suggests that my approach is wrong. Perhaps the formula I'm using is for the reciprocal lattice or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different definition of the interplanar distance.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / [ sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 ) ]\n\nWait, but that's what I've been using. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the angles are not 30 degrees but 60 degrees? Because in a rhombohedral system, angles can be 60 degrees. Wait, the question says 30 degrees, so that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute using 30 degrees but in radians? No, cos(30 degrees) is the same as cos(pi/6) in radians, which is sqrt(3)/2. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps the formula for interplanar distance is:\n\nd = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) / ( (h + k + l)^2 ) ]^(-1/2)\n\nWait, no, that's for a cubic system with specific conditions. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2). But in a rhombohedral system, it's more complicated because of the angles.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula for rhombohedral is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 )\n\nWhich is what I've been using.\n\nHmm. I'm getting the same result, but the answer isn't matching the options. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the question says \"interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom.\" Maybe the interatomic distance refers to the distance between nearest atoms, which in a simple cubic structure is a\u221a1, but in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps it's a\u221a(something else). Hmm. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance could be a, because the atoms are at the corners of the rhombohedral unit cell. So I think my initial assumption that a is 10 A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is along a different direction, like (111), but that would complicate things.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the formula I used is for the (111) reflection in a diffraction pattern, but perhaps I need to consider the reciprocal of the interplanar distance. No, the interplanar distance is the actual distance between planes, so that can't be it.\n\nWait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between two atoms in the same plane, but that doesn't make sense because the interplanar distance is about the spacing between planes, not the distances within the plane.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me consider the volume of the unit cell.\n\nThe volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 \u03b8 + 2 cos^3 \u03b8 ), where \u03b8 is the angle. So for \u03b8=30 degrees, cos\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866.\n\nSo V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n3*(0.866)^2 =3*(0.75) =2.25.\n\n2*(0.866)^3 =2*(0.6495)=1.299.\n\nSo 1 -2.25 +1.299 = (1 +1.299) -2.25=2.299-2.25=0.049.\n\nSo sqrt(0.049)=approx 0.2214.\n\nSo V=10^3 *0.2214=2214 A^3.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps with the interplanar distance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of d, but I don't see how that would help.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute using reciprocal lattice vectors. But that's probably more complicated than needed.\n\nWait, let me think again. The options are all around 9. So if my calculation gives 3.493, but the options are higher, perhaps I inverted the formula. Like, perhaps d = sqrt( ... ) / a, but that would give a larger number.\n\nWait, if I calculate sqrt(8.196) =2.862, then 2.862/10=0.2862. No, that's even smaller.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute 1/d. 1/3.493\u22480.286, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should reevaluate the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 )^{-1}.\n\nWhich is what I have. So for (111), the denominator is sqrt(8.196)=2.862, so d=10/2.862\u22483.493.\n\nHmm. Maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recompute the denominator:\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 =3.\n\nhk=1, so each term in 2*(hk cos\u03b8 + hl cos\u03b8 + kl cos\u03b8) = 2*(3 * (sqrt(3)/2) )=3*sqrt(3)=5.196.\n\nSo denominator inside sqrt is 3 +5.196=8.196. So sqrt(8.196)=2.862.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30, but the question says 30.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator. So 1/2.862\u22480.349. Then d=10*0.349\u22483.49 A. No, same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is d = a / [ (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b1) ) ].\n\nWait, no, that would be a divided by a number larger than 1, making d smaller than a, which is 10. So the result would be even smaller.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the question is about the interplanar distance in a different way, perhaps using the reciprocal lattice.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I should compute the reciprocal of the Miller indices. But that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the sum (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2hk cos \u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b2 + 2kl cos \u03b3 ), but in this case, all angles are 30, so that's what I did.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the formula from a textbook or online. Since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the formula is d = (a) / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos \u03b8 + hl cos \u03b8 + kl cos \u03b8) ) )\n\nWhich is what I've been using. So with a=10, \u03b8=30, h=k=l=1.\n\nSo denominator: 3 + 2*(3*(sqrt(3)/2)) )=3 +3*sqrt(3)=8.196.\n\nSo d=10/2.862\u22483.493 A.\n\nBut the options are all around 9. So perhaps the correct answer is not given, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the question is about a different plane, but the question specifies (111).\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the interplanar distance. 1/d=2.862/10=0.2862. Not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So no.\n\nHmm. Perhaps I should try using the angles as 60 degrees by mistake. Let me compute that.\n\nIf \u03b8=60\u00b0, then cos\u03b8=0.5.\n\nSo denominator: 3 +2*(3*(0.5))=3+3=6.\n\nsqrt(6)=2.449. So d=10/2.449\u22484.082 A. Still not matching the options.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the angles are 120 degrees, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses cos(180-\u03b8). But that would make cos(150)=-sqrt(3)/2, which would make the denominator even bigger.\n\nWait, let me try that. Cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2\u2248-0.866.\n\nDenominator: 3 +2*(3*(-0.866))=3 - 5.196= -2.196. Which is negative, which is impossible. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm. So I'm really stuck. Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that I must have made a mistake in the formula and that the interplanar distance is larger than a, but that doesn't make sense because in a cubic system, d can be smaller or larger depending on the plane.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 )^(-1), which is the same as before. So no change.\n\nHmm. Another idea: Maybe the formula uses the sum (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 ), but I have a wrong approach to the angles. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different for rhombohedral systems.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the metric tensor. The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:\n\na\u00b2 [ 1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1 ]\n\nBut wait, no, because the angles are non-zero, the metric tensor has off-diagonal terms.\n\nThe metric tensor g is:\n\ng_ij = a\u00b2 ( \u03b4_ij + (\u03b4_ij -1) cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, for i\u2260j, the cos\u03b8 terms. So for a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal.\n\nSo the g matrix is:\n\na\u00b2 [ 1 + (0) cos\u03b8, cos\u03b8, cos\u03b8;\n\ncos\u03b8, 1 + (0) cos\u03b8, cos\u03b8;\n\ncos\u03b8, cos\u03b8, 1 + (0) cos\u03b8 ]\n\nWait, no, perhaps each off-diagonal element is cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the g matrix is:\n\na\u00b2 [ 1, cos\u03b8, cos\u03b8;\n\ncos\u03b8, 1, cos\u03b8;\n\ncos\u03b8, cos\u03b8, 1 ]\n\nThen, the reciprocal metric tensor is needed for the interplanar distance. The interplanar distance is given by:\n\nd_{hkl}^2 = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) (1/a\u00b2) [ 1/(g_11 (g_22 g_33) - g_12 g_13 g_23) ) ]\n\nWait, perhaps that's too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for interplanar distance can be written as:\n\nd = [ (a\u00b2 (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2a\u00b2 (hk cos\u03b8 + hl cos\u03b8 + kl cos\u03b8) ) ]^(-1/2)\n\nWhich is the same as the formula I've been using.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, wait! Maybe the interatomic distance is not 'a' but something else. Let's think about this.\n\nIn a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a' because atoms are at the corners. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the interatomic distance is a\u221a(some factor). Hmm.\n\nWait, for a face-centered cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a\u221a2/2. But this is a rhombohedral structure, so perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is a\u221a(some value).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as 'a', as I thought before. So if a=10, then the interplanar distance for (111) is ~3.49 A, which is not among the options.\n\nBut the options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05. So none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 ), which is what I've been using. But perhaps the angles are in a different way. Wait, perhaps I should use cos(180-\u03b8) since in some conventions angles are measured as the supplement. But that would make cos(150) which is -sqrt(3)/2. Let me try that.\n\nSo denominator: 3 +2*(3*(-0.866))=3-5.196= -2.196. Which is negative, so impossible. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is none of the above, but the options don't say that. Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate my initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator. So 1/sqrt(8.196)=0.349. So d=10 * 0.349=3.49 A. No, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator without sqrt. So denominator is 8.196, so 1/8.196\u22480.122. Then d=10 *0.122=1.22 A. No, that's even smaller.\n\nHmm. I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should consider that the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 )^{-1}, which is what I have. So I think the correct calculation leads to d\u22483.49 A, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the question is incorrect or I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the interatomic distance is the edge length of the unit cell, but the formula I'm using requires the lattice parameter a. So perhaps I'm correct, but the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should use the reciprocal of the denominator. But that gives a larger d, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the formula is d = (a) / [ sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2 (hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) ) ]\n\nWhich is the same as before. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps the angles are the internal angles, so 30 degrees is the angle between the axes. So in that case, cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo I think my calculation is correct, but the answer isn't among the options. So perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but the options are given, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the (100) plane, but no, it's (111).\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options, but I'm not confident.\n\n\nTo determine the interplanar distance \\( d \\) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \\cos \\gamma + hl \\cos \\beta + kl \\cos \\alpha)}}\n\\]\n\n### Given Data:\n- Interatomic distance \\( a = 10 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\)\n- Angles \\( \\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 30^\\circ \\)\n- Miller indices \\( h = k = l = 1 \\)\n\n### Calculation:\n1. **Denominator inside the square root**:\n   - \\( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 \\)\n   - \\( 2(hk \\cos \\gamma + hl \\cos \\beta + kl \\cos \\alpha) = 2(1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\cos 30^\\circ + 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\cos 30^\\circ + 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\cos 30^\\circ) \\)\n   - \\( \\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866 \\)\n   - \\( 2(3 \\cdot 0.866) = 2 \\cdot 2.598 = 5.196 \\)\n   - Total denominator: \\( 3 + 5.196 = 8.196 \\)\n\n2. **Square root of the denominator**:\n   - \\( \\sqrt{8.196} \\approx 2.862 \\)\n\n3. **Interplanar distance**:\n   - \\( d = \\frac{10}{2.862} \\approx 3.493 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\)\n\n### Analysis of Options:\nThe calculated interplanar distance \\( d \\approx 3.493 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\) does not match any of the provided options, which are all in the range of 8\u201310 \u00c5. This discrepancy suggests either an issue with the formula interpretation, the given data, or the options provided. Despite multiple checks, the calculation appears consistent with the formula for a rhombohedral crystal.\n\nGiven the mismatch, the most plausible conclusion is that the correct answer is not listed among the options. However, since the question requires selecting from the provided choices, no valid option aligns with the calculated result.\n\n### Final Answer:\nNone of the options match the calculated interplanar distance. However, based on the given choices, no correct answer can be selected.\n\nANSWER: None",
