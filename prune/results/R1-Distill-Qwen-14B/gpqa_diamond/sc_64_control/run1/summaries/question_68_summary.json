      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I need to figure out the oscillation frequency when the magnetic field changes direction. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the setup: initially, the magnetic field points in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment mu is aligned with it. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, with the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nWait, I remember that the magnetic moment mu is related to spin. Oh right, mu equals gamma times Sz, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. So Sz is the spin component along the z-axis, right?\n\nWhen the magnetic field is along Z, the particle's spin will align with it. But when the field switches to Y, things change. I think this involves the Hamiltonian of the system. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu \u00b7 B, right? Because the energy is the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field, but with a negative sign.\n\nSo initially, when the field was along Z, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -mu_z B, which is proportional to Sz. But when the field switches to Y, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -mu_y B. But wait, mu was initially aligned with B in Z, so mu was along Z. So when B changes to Y, mu might start precessing around Y, causing changes in its components.\n\nWait, but since the system is quantum mechanical, the state will be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. Let me think about the energy levels. For a spin-1/2 particle, the energy levels are E = \u00b1 (1/2) gamma B, right? Because the energy is proportional to the magnetic moment times the field. But wait, when the field is along Y, the mu would be in the Y direction. So the energy eigenstates will be |+y> and |-y>, with energies +gamma B/2 and -gamma B/2, perhaps?\n\nWait, let me be precise. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, where S is the spin operator. So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u00b7 B. So when B is in the +Y direction, H = -gamma B (S_y). So the eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_y. The energy eigenvalues would be E = \u00b1 (gamma B) (1/2), since spin 1/2 has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. Wait, but wait, wait. Spin operators usually have eigenvalues for S_i being \u00b1 \u0127/2 multiplied by some factor? Or wait, S_i has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 for spin 1/2.\n\nWait, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 (\u0127/2). So the energies are E = -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2) ? Wait, no: H is proportional to S_y, so E = -gamma B (s_y), with s_y being \u00b1 \u0127/2. So E would be - gamma B (\u0127/2) and gamma B (\u0127/2). Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the signs right here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of angular frequency. The energy levels for spin in a magnetic field are E = \u00b1 (gamma B) (\u0127/2), but wait, I thought the energy is E = -mu \u00b7 B, and mu is gamma S, so E = - gamma B (S \u00b7 n), where n is the direction unit vector. So for B along Y, n is (0,1,0). So S \u00b7 n is S_y, so E = - gamma B S_y.\n\nWait, but S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2, so E = -gamma B (\u00b1 \u0127/2). So that gives E_+ = -gamma B (\u0127/2) * (+1) = - (gamma B \u0127)/(2), and E_- = + (gamma B \u0127)/(2). Hmm, but I'm not sure if we're considering \u0127 here. Wait, in the problem statement, mu is given as gamma * S_z, so perhaps the units are such that \u0127 is absorbed, or maybe the expressions are in terms of angular frequency.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is the frequency at which the magnetic moment precesses around a magnetic field. The formula is omega = gamma B. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The energy levels are E = \u00b1 (gamma B) (something), and the frequency is the difference in energy divided by \u0127. Oh wait, the energy difference between the two states is 2 * (gamma B * \u0127/2) )= gamma B \u0127. So the energy difference is gamma B \u0127. So the frequency of oscillation is (E_+ - E_-)/(h) = (gamma B \u0127)/(h) ) = (gamma B) ( \u0127 / h ) = gamma B (1/(2pi)) ), because \u0127 = h/(2pi).\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, energy difference is E_+ - E_- = [gamma B (\u0127/2)] - [ - gamma B (\u0127/2) ] = gamma B \u0127. So the angular frequency omega is (E_+ - E_-)/ \u0127 = gamma B \u0127 / \u0127 = gamma B. So that would make the angular frequency omega equal to gamma B. But wait, in this case, the magnetic field is along Y, not Z. How does that affect things?\n\nWait a minute, the initial state of the particle was aligned along Z, so when the field changes direction, the state of the system is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will start precessing, leading to oscillations in expectation values.\n\nWait, the problem says the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. So let me think about expectation values. The average of Sz would oscillate with some frequency. So what is the oscillation frequency?\n\nWait, when the Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B, and B is along Y, then the system's time evolution is governed by H. The time evolution of an observable O is given by dO/dt = (i/\u0127) [H, O]. So considering the spin in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.\n\nLet me consider the expectation value of S_z. So d<S_z>/dt = (i/\u0127) [H, S_z]. Let's compute that. H = -gamma B S_y. So [H, S_z] = [ -gamma B S_y, S_z ].\n\nThe commutator [S_y, S_z] is i \u0127 S_x. So [H, S_z] = -gamma B (i \u0127 S_x ). So d<S_z>/dt = (i/\u0127) * (-gamma B) (i \u0127 S_x ) ) = (i/\u0127) * (-gamma B i \u0127) S_x ) = (i * (-gamma B i \u0127 )) / \u0127 * S_x.\n\nLet me compute this step by step: i * (-gamma B i \u0127 ) = (-gamma B) (i^2) \u0127 ) = (-gamma B)(-1) \u0127 ) = gamma B \u0127. Then, divided by \u0127: (gamma B \u0127 ) / \u0127 = gamma B.\n\nSo d<S_z>/dt = gamma B S_x.\n\nWait, but S_x is an operator, so perhaps I need to consider the expectation value here. Let me think again. Wait, I'm trying to find d<S_z>/dt, which is (i/\u0127) < [H, S_z] >.\n\nWait, [H, S_z] = [ -gamma B S_y, S_z ] = -gamma B [S_y, S_z] = -gamma B (i \u0127 S_x ), right? So the expectation value becomes < [H, S_z] > = -gamma B (i \u0127 ) <S_x>.\n\nSo d<S_z>/dt = (i/\u0127) * (-gamma B i \u0127 ) <S_x> ) = (i * -gamma B i \u0127 )/( \u0127 ) ) * <S_x> .\n\nCompute numerator: i * (-gamma B) i \u0127 ) = (-gamma B) (i^2) \u0127 ) = (-gamma B)(-1) \u0127 ) = gamma B \u0127.\n\nSo (gamma B \u0127) / \u0127 ) = gamma B.\n\nSo d<S_z>/dt = gamma B <S_x>.\n\nWait, that's not helpful yet. Hmm, perhaps I need another equation. Let me compute d<S_x>/dt.\n\nd<S_x>/dt = (i/\u0127) < [H, S_x] >.\n\n[H, S_x] = [ -gamma B S_y, S_x ] = -gamma B [ S_y, S_x ].\n\n[S_y, S_x] = i \u0127 S_z, so [H, S_x] = -gamma B (i \u0127 S_z )\n\nSo < [H, S_x] > = -gamma B (i \u0127 ) <S_z>.\n\nSo d<S_x>/dt = (i/\u0127) * (-gamma B i \u0127 ) <S_z> ) = (i * (-gamma B i \u0127 )) / \u0127 ) <S_z>.\n\nAgain, compute the numerator: i * (-gamma B) i \u0127 = (-gamma B) (i^2) \u0127 = (-gamma B)(-1) \u0127 = gamma B \u0127.\n\nDivide by \u0127: gamma B.\n\nSo d<S_x>/dt = gamma B <S_z>.\n\nSo now we have a system of two differential equations:\n\nd<S_z>/dt = gamma B <S_x>\nd<S_x>/dt = gamma B <S_z>\n\nHmm, this looks like coupled first-order differential equations. Let me think of S_x and S_z as variables, say X and Z.\n\ndZ/dt = gamma B X\ndX/dt = gamma B Z\n\nThis is a system of linear ODEs. Let me write it in matrix form:\n\nd/dt [Z; X] = gamma B [0 1; 1 0 ] [Z; X]\n\nThe eigenvalues of the matrix can be found by setting det( [ -lambda 1; 1 -lambda ] )=0. So lambda^2 -1 =0 \u2192 lambda= \u00b11. So the eigenvalues are \u00b1gamma B.\n\nWait, because the matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], its eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So when multiplied by gamma B, the eigenvalues are gamma B and -gamma B.\n\nThe general solution will involve terms like exp( gamma B t ) and exp( -gamma B t ). So the oscillation frequency would be gamma B?\n\nBut wait, wait, wait. Wait, the equations are:\n\ndZ/dt = gamma B X\ndX/dt = gamma B Z\n\nIf I differentiate again, I can get a second-order equation.\n\nd\u00b2Z/dt\u00b2 = gamma B dX/dt = gamma B (gamma B Z) )= (gamma B)^2 Z.\n\nSo d\u00b2Z/dt\u00b2 = (gamma B)^2 Z.\n\nThe general solution for Z(t) is A e^{gamma B t} + B e^{-gamma B t}.\n\nBut that's exponential growth and decay, not oscillation. Wait, but that can't be right because the initial conditions would determine the coefficients. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider a state |psi> where initially, the spin is along +Z, so its state is | \u2191_z \u27e9. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to Y, the state doesn't change instantaneously, so the initial state is | \u2191_z \u27e9.\n\nThe time evolution is given by the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution operator is exp( -i H t / \u0127 ). Since H = -gamma B S_y, so H = -gamma B (S_y).\n\nThe time evolution is U(t) = exp( i gamma B S_y t / \u0127 )\n\nTo find the expectation value of S_z, let's compute <S_z> = < \u2191_z | U\u2020(t) S_z U(t) | \u2191_z >.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to represent S_y and S_z in terms of Pauli matrices. For a spin-1/2 particle, S_i = (\u0127/2) sigma_i. So S_y = (\u0127/2) sigma_y, S_z = (\u0127/2) sigma_z.\n\nSo H = -gamma B ( (\u0127/2) sigma_y ) = (-gamma B \u0127/2 ) sigma_y.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( (-i H t ) / \u0127 ) = exp( (i gamma B sigma_y t ) / 2 )\n\nSo U(t) can be written using the identity that exp(i theta sigma_y /2 ) = I cos(theta/2) + i sigma_y sin(theta/2).\n\nSo the time evolution is U(t) = cos( (gamma B t)/2 ) I + i sigma_y sin( (gamma B t)/2 )\n\nNow, compute <S_z> = < \u2191_z | U\u2020 S_z U | \u2191_z >.\n\nLet me compute U\u2020, which is U^dagger. Since sigma_y is Hermitian, U is unitary. So U\u2020 = exp( (-i gamma B sigma_y t ) / 2 ) = cos( (gamma B t)/2 ) I - i sigma_y sin( (gamma B t)/2 )\n\nS_z is (\u0127/2) sigma_z. So let's compute:\n\nU\u2020 S_z U = [ cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta) ] ( (\u0127/2) sigma_z ) [ cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta) ]\n\nWhere theta = (gamma B t)/2.\n\nLet me compute this product step by step. Let me denote theta as (gamma B t)/2 for simplicity.\n\nSo,\n\nU\u2020 = cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta)\nU = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta)\n\nCompute U\u2020 sigma_z U:\n\n= [ cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta) ] sigma_z [ cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta) ]\n\nHmm, let's compute the product step by step. Let me expand the terms.\n\nFirst, compute the product [ cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta) ] sigma_z [ cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta) ]\n\nLet me compute each multiplication step.\n\nFirst, compute [ cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta) ] sigma_z:\n\n= cos(theta) I sigma_z - i sigma_y sin(theta) sigma_z\n\n= cos(theta) sigma_z - i sigma_y sigma_z sin(theta)\n\nNow, sigma_y sigma_z is i sigma_x. Because sigma_y sigma_z = i sigma_x. Wait, let's check:\n\nsigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]\nsigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]\nsigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nsigma_y sigma_z = [[0*(-1) + (-i)(0), 0*0 + (-i)(-1)], [i*0 + 0*0, i*(-1) + 0*0 ] ]\n\nWait, sorry, perhaps better to compute it:\n\nsigma_y * sigma_z = [[0*(-1) + (-i)(0), 0*0 + (-i)(-1)], [i*0 + 0*0, i*(-1) + 0*0 ]]\n\nWait, no. Matrix multiplication is row by column.\n\nSo sigma_y is:\n\n[ [0, -i],\n  [i, 0] ]\n\nsigma_z is:\n\n[ [1, 0],\n  [0, -1] ]\n\nSo sigma_y * sigma_z is:\n\nFirst row: (0 * 1) + (-i * 0) = 0; (0 * 0) + (-i * -1) = i.\n\nSecond row: (i * 1) + (0 * 0) = i; (i *0) + (0 * -1) = 0.\n\nSo sigma_y sigma_z = [[0, i], [i, 0]].\n\nWait, but I remember that sigma_y sigma_z = i sigma_x. Let me compute sigma_x: [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\ni sigma_x = [[0, i], [i, 0]]. Which matches the product sigma_y sigma_z.\n\nSo back to the computation:\n\n= cos(theta) sigma_z - i (i sigma_x) sin(theta )\n\n= cos(theta) sigma_z - i^2 sigma_x sin(theta )\n\ni^2 is -1, so:\n\n= cos(theta) sigma_z + sigma_x sin(theta )\n\nNow, multiply this result by [ cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta) ]\n\nSo:\n\n[ cos(theta) sigma_z + sigma_x sin(theta) ] [ cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta) ]\n\nLet's distribute this:\n\n= cos(theta) sigma_z cos(theta) I + cos(theta) sigma_z (i sigma_y sin(theta) )\n+ sigma_x sin(theta) cos(theta) I + sigma_x sin(theta) (i sigma_y sin(theta) )\n\nSimplify each term.\n\nTerm 1: cos(theta)^2 sigma_z\n\nTerm 2: i cos(theta) sin(theta) sigma_z sigma_y\n\nTerm 3: sin(theta) cos(theta) sigma_x\n\nTerm 4: i sigma_x sigma_y sin(theta)^2\n\nNow, let's compute each term.\n\nTerm 2: sigma_z sigma_y = -i sigma_x (since sigma_z sigma_y = i sigma_x, but wait, actually, let's compute it.\n\nWait, sigma_z sigma_y = [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [[0,-i],[i,0]] = [[0*1 + (-i)*0, 1*(-i) + 0*0], [0*0 + (-1)*i, 0*(-i) + (-1)*0]]\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to recall that sigma_i sigma_j = i epsilon_ijk sigma_k, where epsilon is the Levi-Civita symbol.\n\nsigma_z sigma_y = i sigma_x (since i= z, j=y, k=x, and epsilon_zyx=1).\n\nHmm, wait, let's check:\n\ni=3, j=2: sigma_3 sigma_2 = i sigma_1.\n\nSo sigma_z sigma_y = i sigma_x.\n\nSo term 2: sigma_z sigma_y = i sigma_x.\n\nSo term 2 becomes i cos(theta) sin(theta) (i sigma_x) = i^2 cos(theta) sin(theta) sigma_x = - cos(theta) sin(theta) sigma_x.\n\nTerm 4: sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z.\n\nWait, sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z.\n\nSo term 4 becomes i sigma_x sigma_y sin^2(theta) = i (i sigma_z) sin^2(theta) = i^2 sigma_z sin^2(theta) = (-1) sigma_z sin^2(theta).\n\nNow, putting all terms together:\n\nTerm 1: cos^2(theta) sigma_z\n\nTerm 2: - cos(theta) sin(theta) sigma_x\n\nTerm 3: sin(theta) cos(theta) sigma_x\n\nTerm 4: - sigma_z sin^2(theta)\n\nNow, let's add terms:\n\nsigma_x terms: (- cos theta sin theta + sin theta cos theta ) sigma_x \u2192 0.\n\nsigma_z terms: cos^2(theta) sigma_z - sigma_z sin^2(theta) = sigma_z ( cos^2 theta - sin^2 theta ) = sigma_z cos(2 theta).\n\nSo overall:\n\nU\u2020 sigma_z U = sigma_z cos(2 theta ) + 0.\n\nSo, <S_z> = < \u2191_z | U\u2020 sigma_z U | \u2191_z > ( \u0127/2 )\n\nBut sigma_z | \u2191_z \u27e9 = | \u2191_z \u27e9.\n\nSo, < \u2191_z | sigma_z | \u2191_z \u27e9 = 1.\n\nThus, <S_z> = ( \u0127/2 ) * cos(2 theta )\n\nSince theta is (gamma B t )/2, 2 theta = gamma B t.\n\nSo, <S_z> = ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, mu = gamma Sz. So the average of the z-component of the moment is <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma * ( \u0127/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nSo the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Because cos has a frequency of gamma B.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is gamma*B. So the answer should be B.\n\n\nTo determine the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, we analyze the system as follows:\n\nThe particle is a spin-1/2 system with magnetic moment **\u03bc = \u03b3S** (where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator). Initially, the magnetic field **B** points along the +Z direction, aligning the magnetic moment with the field. When the field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes:\n\n\\[\nH = -\\mu \\cdot B = -\\gamma B S_y\n\\]\n\nThe eigenstates of \\( S_y \\) are the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian, with eigenvalues \\( \\pm \\hbar/2 \\). The energy difference between these states is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\gamma B \\hbar\n\\]\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the system is determined by the energy difference divided by \\( \\hbar \\), which gives:\n\n\\[\n\\omega = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\hbar} = \\gamma B\n\\]\n\nTo confirm this, we compute the time evolution of the expectation value of \\( S_z \\). The initial state is \\( | \\uparrow_z \\rangle \\), which is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution operator is:\n\n\\[\nU(t) = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} = e^{i\\gamma B S_y t / \\hbar}\n\\]\n\nUsing the identity \\( e^{i\\theta S_y} = \\cos(\\theta)I + i\\sin(\\theta)S_y \\), the time evolution operator becomes:\n\n\\[\nU(t) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right)I + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\gamma B t}{2}\\right)S_y\n\\]\n\nThe expectation value of \\( S_z \\) is computed as:\n\n\\[\n\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\langle \\uparrow_z | U^\\dagger S_z U | \\uparrow_z \\rangle\n\\]\n\nAfter detailed computation, the result simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the z-component of the spin oscillates with a frequency \\( \\gamma B \\). Since the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin (\\( \\mu = \\gamma S \\)), the z-component of the magnetic moment also oscillates with the same frequency.\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\gamma B}\n\\]\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n- **A) \\( \\gamma B / 2 \\):** Incorrect. The frequency is not halved; the energy difference directly gives \\( \\gamma B \\).\n- **B) \\( \\gamma B \\):** Correct. This matches the derived oscillation frequency.\n- **C) \\( \\sqrt{2} \\gamma B \\):** Incorrect.
