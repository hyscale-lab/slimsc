Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

Wait, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So the isotope would be Li-6 because lithium normally has 3 protons and 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6. So the nucleus is a lithium-6 nucleus.

First, I need to figure out the rest mass of this nucleus. The rest mass energy would be needed to compute the total energy when it's moving at 0.96c. So, I remember that the rest energy is given by E = mc², but I also need to consider relativistic effects since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light.

But wait, the problem is about the total energy of the ion in the collider. So I should use the relativistic energy formula: E = γ * m₀c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Right, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Let me compute γ first. The speed v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)² = 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, since 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So γ is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Let me check that calculation again. 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/0.28 is 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.5714. Yeah.

Next, I need the rest mass of the lithium-6 nucleus. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². But wait, lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass would be (3 * 938) + (3 * 939). Let me compute that.

3 * 938
