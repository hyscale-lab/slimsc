Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that each spectrograph has its own brightness limit. The question says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V magnitude, and HIRES can observe up to 16 V mag. So a star needs to be bright enough to be seen by both.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see them? Because each has different limits. So the star's apparent magnitude must be brighter than both of their limits. But wait, wait. No. Because each has a different limit. Let me think again.

Wait, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. So stars with V mag less than 17. Because lower magnitude is brighter. So for ESPRESSO, apparent V mag must be ≤17, right? Because if a star is brighter, its V mag is lower. So if a star's V mag is 16, that's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 mag, so V mag ≤16.

So, for a star to be detected by both, it must have V mag ≤16, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES can only go up to 16. So the star must be brighter than 16 V mag. So any star that has an apparent V magnitude ≤16 will be visible by both.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says for ESPRESSO, brighter than 17 mag. So stars with V mag brighter than 17, meaning V <17. So, stars with V mag less than 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V mag brighter than 16, so V <16.

Wait, the way it's worded is: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. So the maximum magnitude ESPRESSO can handle is 17. So if a star is at 17, it's at the limit. But can it observe stars exactly at 17? The wording says brighter than, so I'm not sure. If it's 'brighter than 17', that would mean up to 17, but not including 17. Or maybe it's including. Hmm, but for the purpose of this question, perhaps the exact limit is 17 and 16 respectively.

So a star that's visible to both must have an apparent V mag ≤16. Because HIRES can only see up to 16, so any star with V mag brighter than 16 (i.e., V ≤16) would be detectable by both.

Wait, no. Wait, let me get this right. So, the detectable apparent V magnitude for both. For a star to be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES, its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than both of their limits. But since HIRES has a lower limit, the stricter condition is V mag <16. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be below 16.

Wait, but wait. Let
