Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in astronomy. Oh right, the parallax of a star is the angle subtended at the Earth by the star's position as seen from opposite ends of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. So the formula I think is plx = 1/distance, but wait, in what units? Oh right, parsecs. So distance d is in parsecs, and plx in arcseconds, right. So plx = 1/d (d in parsecs). So the larger the distance, the smaller the parallax.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, it's about the distribution of stars in terms of parallax. Let me think about how many stars are at a certain distance. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number of stars per unit volume is constant.

Wait, uniform distribution implies that the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a volume dV should be proportional to dV. Now, how does that translate to parallax?

I recall that the number of stars per unit volume is n. So if I have a thin spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dd, the volume would be 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell is surface area (4πd²) times thickness (dd). Since the number of stars is n times volume, that's n * 4π d² dd.

But I need to express this in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that. So the number of stars in a shell would be n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d d). Wait, but I should express dd in terms of d plx. Because we're considering a change in plx, say d plx. So how does dd relate to d plx?

Let me think, since plx = 1/d, then d plx = - (1/d²) dd. Oh wait, taking the derivative, d plx/d d = -1/(d^2). So dd = -d^2 d plx. Since d plx is positive when plx increases (and d decreases), the negative sign indicates the direction. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, maybe we can ignore the sign and just take the absolute value. So, |dd| = (d^2) |d plx|. Substituting d = 1/plx, then |dd| = (1/plx)^2 |d plx|.

So the number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + d plx is:

n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx) * (d^2) [Wait, no. Wait, let's go back. The volume is 4π d² dd. So the number is n * 4π d² dd. But dd = d^2 d plx (since d plx = -1/d² dd → dd = -d² d plx). So substituting:

Number of stars = n * 4π d² * (-d² d plx). Hmm, but the negative just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. So for the number, we can take absolute values.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to change
