Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities for two Earth-like planets. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says that both planets have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the key here is that we need to figure out which one has a higher probability of transiting, so that the researchers should observe that one.

Wait, transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is closer to edge-on. But how do we calculate that? I remember something about the probability being proportional to (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a_planet)^2, but wait, actually, I think the exact formula is more about the relative sizes and orbital parameters.

Wait, let me think. The probability of a planet transiting is roughly proportional to (R_star / a_planet)^2, assuming the orbit is randomly oriented. So the probability P is approximately (R_star / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis. Because a larger a (further away) makes the transit less likely, as the planet's path is a smaller angle relative to the star's size.

But wait, the planets are Earth-like, so their radii are much smaller than the stars, so R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So we can ignore R_planet in the calculation. So P ≈ (R_star / a)^2.

Now, the question gives us some info. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 / 3.

The host stars have the same radii. So R_star1 = R_star2.

Wait, but the host stars have different masses. Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But since both have the same radius, that might not directly affect the transit probability, but I need to check the orbital distances.

Because the planets have the same mass, but their host stars have different masses. Using Kepler's third law to find the semi-major axis.

Kepler's third law says that (a^3) / (P^2) = G(M_star + M_planet) / (4π²). But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So a^3 ∝ M_star * P^2.

Wait, but wait
