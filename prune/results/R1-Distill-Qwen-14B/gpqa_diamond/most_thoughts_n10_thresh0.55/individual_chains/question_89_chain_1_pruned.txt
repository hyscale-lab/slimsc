Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a diamond but with all the carbons in a certain arrangement. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on the first and third positions of the adamantane skeleton.

First, when heated with excess KOH at 240°C, it forms product 1. The 1H NMR data is given: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. The IR peak suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone. So, this reaction is likely an elimination, forming a ketone via a dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane would undergo dehydrohalogenation when treated with a strong base like KOH. Since there are two bromines, maybe it's a double elimination. Wait, no, wait. KOH in such conditions usually leads to elimination from vicinal dihalides, but in this case, the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, which are not adjacent. Hmm, so maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the bromides undergo elimination to form an alkene, but since the product has a carbonyl, perhaps it
