Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the question is about identifying the final product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The data given are IR and 1H NMR spectra. There are four options to choose from.

Let me start by analyzing the spectral data for compound X.

First, the IR data: The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates the presence of O-H or N-H stretches. But since the compound is reacting with red phosphorus and HI, which is a reagent often used in the hydrolysis of esters or possibly for elimination reactions, maybe it's an ester or something with a leaving group.

The IR also shows a peak around 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Common groups with this are ketones, esters, aldehydes, or maybe acids. But the 1720 is a bit higher than a ketone (which is usually around 1700-1750, but ketones are often lower than esters). Wait, actually, esters typically show around 1735-1765, so 1720 might be an ester or possibly a carboxylic acid, but carboxylic acids have broader O-H stretches. If the O-H is present, the IR would have a broad peak around 2500-3000. Looking back, the first peak is 3400–2500, which is a broad region, possibly an O-H stretch. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then why is there a carbonyl at 1720? Carboxylic acids usually have higher carbonyl stretches, like 1700, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, it could be an ester. Let's keep that in mind.

Moving to the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows several peaks. Let's list them:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton or maybe an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm. But wait, 10.5 seems a bit low for a carboxylic acid; they are usually higher. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde, but the integration is 1H, so maybe an aldehyde or an acidic proton.

Wait, but the IR didn't show a strong peak around 2500-3000 cm⁻¹, except the 3400–2500. Maybe that's an O-H from a carboxylic acid. So perhaps it's a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking further:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if you have a substituent in the para position, the protons on either side (ortho and meta) would split into doublets. So maybe the ring is p-substituted. The 8.0
