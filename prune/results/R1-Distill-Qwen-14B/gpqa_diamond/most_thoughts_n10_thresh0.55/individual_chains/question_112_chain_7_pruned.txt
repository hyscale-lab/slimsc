Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about an electron's state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix is given by Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with quantum states, the state vector can be written in terms of the basis states, which here are |up> and |down>. The given state is proportional, so I'll probably need to normalize it first.

First, let's write down the given state. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me think about the components. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). To normalize, I need to compute the norm of this vector.

The norm squared is |1+i|² + |2-i|². Let me calculate each modulus squared:

|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.
|2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.
So the total is 2 +5=7. So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] divided by sqrt(7) to normalize it. So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down> .

Okay, now the operator given has matrix Aij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So it's a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, is that right? Because for i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2. So in a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2.

So the operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Hmm. Now, the eigenstates of A are what we're interested in, because the question is about measuring in the eigenstates of A.

Wait, but to find the probability of measuring a particular eigenstate, we need to express the given state |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenstates of A are known, and we can compute the expansion coefficients.

Alternatively, maybe I can diagonalize matrix A first. Because if I can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then I can express |alpha> in terms of those eigenvectors, and the probabilities would be the square of the amplitudes.

Let's proceed to diagonalize A.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Let me consider the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λ I) =0.

So, determinant of [ [-λ, ħ/2 ], [ħ/2, -λ ] ] = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0. So λ² = ħ²/4. Thus, λ = ± ħ/2.

Wait, so the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So the eigenstates are the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues.

Now, finding the eigenvectors. For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λ I ) |v> =0.

So,

[ [ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ] , [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ] ] [v1; v2] = 0.

The equations are:

- (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 +v2=0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors
