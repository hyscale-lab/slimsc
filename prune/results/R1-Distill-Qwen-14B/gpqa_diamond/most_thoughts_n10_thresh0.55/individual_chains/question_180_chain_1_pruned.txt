Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to think about what kind of energy we're dealing with here. Since all the particles are charged and they're interacting with each other, it's probably electrostatic potential energy. Because the system is isolated, we can ignore any external fields or anything, so the energy will be due to the arrangement of these charges.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P, right? So the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the setup is: one charge at the center (fixed), and twelve charges arranged around it at 2 meters.

Wait a second, but the way the problem is phrased, it's 12 charges at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge. So each of the twelve is at a distance r = 2 m from the central charge.

But wait, the problem is about the potential energy of the entire system. Since all charges are identical and the same sign, they repel each other. So the potential energy will be a sum of the potential energies between each pair.

Wait, but how do I compute the total potential energy in a system of multiple charges? I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. And since potential energy is a pairwise thing, I think the formula is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * sum over all pairs of (q_i q_j)/r_ij.

But wait, let me think. For a system of n charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each unique pair. So each pair contributes once.

In this case, there are 13 charges. But the 13th is fixed at P
