Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take a deep breath and start thinking.

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. The reactions are as follows:

1. Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. Then, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different choices for A and B.

First, I'll tackle the first reaction. I know that butan-2-one is a ketone, specifically (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures to visualize.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, no, let me think again. Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the structure: the nitrile group (CN) attached to a carbon that's also attached to a hydroxyl group (OH) and two methyl groups. Wait, but butanenitrile has four carbons including the nitrile. So, structure is CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction. The starting material is a ketone, and it's reacting with NaCN and reagent A. I remember that the nucleophilic addition of cyanide ions to ketones typically occurs in a specific way. But wait, wait, waitâ€”wait. Normally, the cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and can add to carbonyl groups. But wait, but in the presence of an acid, perhaps?

Wait, but wait. The first reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN and A giving the nitrile and the alcohol. Wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If I add NaCN, which is a source of CN-, and perhaps a proton source, maybe
