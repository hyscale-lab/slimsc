Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and the compound is reacted with a series of reagents. I need to identify the final product from the options given.

First, let me look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let me think about what each of these signals could represent.

Starting with the 9.72 ppm triplet. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the molecule.

Next, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets. Each has 2H. These could be aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene ring. Wait, but the integration is 2H each, so maybe two sets of aromatic protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group nearby. But looking at the coupling, the 6.98 is a d (doublet), which suggests each proton is coupled to one other proton. The 6.51 is also a doublet. So perhaps a trans di-substituted double bond, maybe part of an aromatic ring? Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents. Let me think: if it's a para-substituted benzene, the protons would be two sets of doublets, but that's usually around 7 ppm. Alternatively, could it be a vinyl group in a conjugated system, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde?

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet with 2H. Broad usually means exchange with something, like an -OH proton. Wait, but it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system, like an enol where the protons are exchanging rapidly, causing a broad peak. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring that's di-substituted, but not para. Or perhaps it's a diene or some kind of conjugated system.

The 3.66 ppm doublet with 2H. That seems like a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe oxygen. For example, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether or ester, but in this case, the molecular formula has one N and one O. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So it's an aromatic compound with an aldehyde (from the 9.72 ppm), maybe some substituents, and perhaps a nitro group or an amino group? Wait, the formula has one N. Oh, but wait, the reagents involve nitrous acid, which is usually used for diazotization. So maybe the starting compound has an amine group.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the reagents applied:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: this is usually used for diazotization. So the starting material must have an aromatic am
