Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, but it has dark spots covering one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. The filling factor is 20% for the spots. The issue is that when we observe this star, its brightness variations due to the spots rotating into and out of view can look like the transit of an exoplanet. The question is asking what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the spots do.

Hmm. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar where Rpl is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius (same as the Sun's). 

I remember that the brightness change when a planet transits a star is calculated by the area blocked. The formula for the change in brightness (delta F) is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, assuming the planet blocks that fraction of the star's light. 

But wait, in this case, the spots are causing a dip in brightness as the star rotates. So perhaps we need to calculate the equivalent effect of the spots on the star's overall brightness and see what planet size would cause the same dip.

Let me think about the star's spots. The spots are cooler, so when they are facing us, the star appears dimmer. The filling factor is 20%, so the area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. So if one hemisphere is entirely spotty, then the area of the spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 * (area of one hemisphere).

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4πR^2. One hemisphere is 2πR^2. The spots cover 20% of that, so the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR^2 = 0.4π R^2.

But wait, the star's total area is 4πR^2, so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4π R^2) / (4π R^2) ) = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface. Hmm, that's important because when the star rotates, only part of the spots is visible, but perhaps in terms of brightness variation, the maximum dip would be when the spots are fully rotated into view.

Wait, but the star is observed from Earth, so as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates so that the spot hemisphere is facing us, we see the maximum effect. The brightness variation would be the difference between the star's normal brightness and when the spots are in view.

So the brightness change due to the spots would depend on the area of the spots and the temperature difference. The star's brightness is due to its blackbody radiation. So the total luminosity is 4πR^2 * sigma * Teff^4.

When the spots are in view, the luminosity decreases. The spots have a lower temperature (Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K), so their contribution to the luminosity is sigma * T_spot^4. The area of the spots is 0.4π R^2 because the hemisphere is one side (2π R^2) and 20% coverage.

Wait, no. The area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area. So 0.2 * 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2 as I thought earlier.

So the luminosity of the spots when they are facing us is 0.4 π R^2 * sigma * T_spot^4. The rest of the star's surface is at 6000 K. The rest of the star's area when the spots are visible is (2π R^2 - 0.4 π R^2) = 1.6 π R^2. So the non-spots part of the star
