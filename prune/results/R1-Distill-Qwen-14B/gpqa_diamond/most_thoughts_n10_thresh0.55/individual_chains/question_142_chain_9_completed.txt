Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about the density matrix ρ given by (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space, and choose between four options: A, B, C, D, with given r vectors.

Wait, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. A pure state is represented by a density matrix ρ = |ψ><ψ|, and it's a rank-1 matrix. But this ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Oh, right! That's a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>. Because each term is 1/2, it's like a 50-50 mixture.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |θ, φ>, the corresponding point on the unit sphere has angles θ and φ. The density matrix is then (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector (r_x, r_y, r_z), and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So, density matrix ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2. Comparing that with the given ρ, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, wait. Let me compute that.

The identity matrix I is |0><0| + |1><1|, right? Because for a 2x2 system, the identity matrix is the sum of the outer products of the basis vectors.

So ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 = I/2. Because I is |0><0| + |1><1|.

Hmm, and the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if I/2 is equal to (I + r·σ)/2, then subtract I/2 from both sides: 0 = (r·σ)/2. So r·σ must be zero matrix.

What's r·σ? It's r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. For that to be zero, each component must be zero. Therefore, r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0. So r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but what's the Bloch vector of the state ρ=I/2? Oh right, the completely mixed state, which is the maximally uncertain state, corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. Because all possible states are equally likely, so it's at the center.

So the position vector r should be (0,0,0), which is option C.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically a statistical mixture of the basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability. The density matrix can also be written as \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix for a 2x2 quantum system.

In the Bloch sphere representation, any density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), it follows that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero: \(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), and \(r_z = 0\). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the density matrix \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\) corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
