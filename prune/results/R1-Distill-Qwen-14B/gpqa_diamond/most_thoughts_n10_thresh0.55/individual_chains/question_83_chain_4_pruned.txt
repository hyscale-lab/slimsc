Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. But let's take it step by step. 

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me read the details again. We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. Let's see, the initial volume is 20 cm³ and concentration 0.05 M. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So, M2 would be (M1V1)/V2. Plugging in the numbers: (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But for the purpose of the initial concentration, yeah, that's correct.

Next, when we titrate with NaOH, which is a strong base. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized to form acetate ions. The solution will contain sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

But before that, at 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So I'll need to calculate the pH at both points.

Let me outline what I need to do:

1. Calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution.
2. Determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach 25% titration and the equivalence point.
3. Set up the calculations for the pH at each of these points.

Wait, for the equivalence point, perhaps it's easier to first calculate the moles of acetic acid present initially, then find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point. Similarly, for 25% titration, it'll be a quarter of that amount.

So, let's start by finding the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³ (which is 0.04 L), and concentration is 0.025 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

Wait, 0.04 L? Because 40 cm³ is 0.04 liters. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Yep, that's correct.

The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O
