Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Oh wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant tells us how stable the complex is.

So, I think I need to use the concept of the formation constant to find the concentration of free calcium ions. The formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where a metal ion binds with EDTA to form a complex. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex.

The reaction for the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex would be: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So, the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

In this problem, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. I assume this is the concentration at equilibrium because the solution is prepared with that complex already, right? So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we need to find the concentration of Ca²+ in solution.

Wait, but EDTA is a hexadentate ligand. Oh, right, but in this case, it's already forming a complex with Ca²+, so the solution only has the complex and any dissociated ions.

Wait, but what about the dissociation of EDTA? Because EDTA itself is a polydentate ligand and exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. Oh, but the question says the pH is ideal, which I think means that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, EDTA^4-. So, I don't have to worry about the different protonation states of EDTA here. That simplifies things.

So, I can model this as a simple equilibrium problem. Let me write down what I know.

Let me denote:
- [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M (given)
- Kf = 5e10 = 5x10^10.

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are very small, assuming the complex doesn't dissociate much. Wait, no, because Kf is very large, meaning the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will be very low.

But wait, the problem is to find [Ca²+], so let's set up the equation.

The formation constant equation is:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-})

So, rearranging, [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-] / (Kf * [EDTA^4-})

But wait, I don't know [EDTA^4-]. Hmm, how can I relate these concentrations?

Wait, initially, before the complex forms, the solution has Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But in
