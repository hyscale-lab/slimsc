Okay, so I have this question about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me think.

Rhombohedral crystals... I remember they have all sides equal but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. Oh wait, in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. So the lattice is rhombohedral with each angle 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance... does that mean the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms? I think so because in a cubic system, the interatomic distance is the edge length. But wait, rhombohedral is a bit different. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, all edges are equal, so a = b = c, but the angles between them are equal but not 90 degrees. So yeah, a is 10 Angstroms here.

The question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember the formula for interplanar distance (d) in a crystal system is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices times the structure factor. Wait, no, that's for cubic systems. The general formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * (some factor involving the angles). Oh right, I think it's 1/d² = (h² + k²
