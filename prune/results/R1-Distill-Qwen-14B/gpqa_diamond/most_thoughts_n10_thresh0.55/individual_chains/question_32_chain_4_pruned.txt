Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy of the RHIC such that a nucleus X moves at 0.96c. Nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, okay, so first I need to figure out what nucleus X is.

Li is lithium. The standard notation is Li-7, I think. Because lithium has 3 protons and typically 4 neutrons (since 7-3=4), but wait, the question says X has 3 neutrons. Oh wait no, wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So, number of protons is 3 (since Li is element 3), and 3 neutrons. That makes the mass number A = 3 +3 =6. So X is Li-6? Or wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, Li has atomic number 3, so 3 protons. If X has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 +3 =6. So X is Li-6.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. So, protons = 3, neutrons =3, so total mass number is 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li, right? Okay.

Now, the problem is to find the energy of the RHIC, which is a collider. I remember that in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is often what's given, but sometimes it's the total energy. Wait, but I think in this case, the energy likely refers to the kinetic energy. Or wait, no, perhaps the total energy. Hmm. Let me think. The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So I think the energy here is the total energy, because when you talk about the energy of a particle in a collider, it's usually the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic). Wait, wait, but sometimes it's the kinetic energy. Hmm, this is a point of confusion.

Wait, but the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. So if the question is asking for the energy of the nucleus, it's probably the total energy
