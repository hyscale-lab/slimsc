Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, β, indicate how stable a complex is. The larger the β, the more stable the complex. So the question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt-containing species.

Wait, let me read the problem again. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I think each β corresponds to a different complex, probably with different numbers of SCN- ligands.

So the complexes formed are Co(SCN)_n^2+ where n is 0,1,2,3,4? Or maybe n is from 1 to 4? Wait, β1 is for the first complex, which would be Co(SCN)^(2+), because for each n, the charge would decrease. Wait, Co^2+ has a charge of +2. Each SCN^- is -1, so for each SCN added, the charge becomes +2 - n(1). So for n=1, Co(SCN) has charge +1, n=2, it becomes 0, and so on. But wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to a different complex, from n=1 to n=4.

Wait, no. Wait, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^2+ - no, wait, Co^2+ with n SCN^- would have a charge of 2+ - n*(1-). So n=0 would be Co^2+; n=1 would be Co(SCN)^+, n=2 would be Co(SCN)_2, neutral; n=3 would be Co(SCN)_3^-; n=4 would be Co(SCN)_4^2-.

But the stability constants are β1 to β4. So for each complex, the β is the formation constant for that particular complex. For example, β1 is the constant for Co(SCN)^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2, etc.

Wait, but the problem statement says "dithiocyanato cobalt(II
