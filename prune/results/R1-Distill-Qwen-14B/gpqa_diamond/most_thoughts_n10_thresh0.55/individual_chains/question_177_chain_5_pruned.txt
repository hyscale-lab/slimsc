Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, I remember something about blackbody radiation—wavelength of maximum emission is related to temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, maybe their temperatures are the same? Because the blackbody curve's maximum wavelength depends on the temperature. So both stars have the same temperature.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1's velocity is 0 km/s, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity might affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, but wait, the problem says they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So the observed wavelengths are the same. But does that affect the calculation of their luminosities? Or maybe the radial velocities are a red herring here, perhaps not directly affecting the luminosity calculation because luminosity is an intrinsic property. So I might not need to worry about the velocities for the luminosity part.

The question is about the luminosity ratio. The astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So I need to find L1 / L2.

I know that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a blackbody radiator) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says they radiate as black bodies, so yeah, that's the formula. Since I'm looking for the ratio, the 4πσ constants will cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

We know R1 is 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. What about the temperatures?

Earlier, I thought the peak wavelengths are the same. Because the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. So the temperature ratio is 1.

Wait, but wait. Are the observed wavelengths the same because of the Doppler shift? Because Star_2 is moving towards us (radial velocity of 700 km/s), its light would be blueshifted. So if the intrinsic peak wavelengths are the same, but Star_2 is moving, the observed lambda_max would be different. But the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. So that must mean that the Doppler shift for Star_2 brings its emitted peak wavelength to match that of Star_1, which has no velocity.

Wait, that could complicate things. Because the observed lambda_max is the same for both. So perhaps their intrinsic temperatures are different, but due to Doppler shift, the observed lambda_max is the same.

Let me think. The observed wavelength lambda_obs is related to the emitted (intrinsic) wavelength lambda_emit via the Doppler effect. For a star moving towards us with velocity v, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted) by a factor given by 1/(1 + v/c), assuming v is much less than c, which it is here (700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light, so non-relativistic approximation should hold).

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but wait, no, that's the relativistic formula. At non-relativistic speeds, we can approximate it as lambda_obs ≈ lambda_emit (1 - v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity (negative for moving towards us). Alternatively, another approximation is lambda_obs ≈ lambda_emit (1 + v_r/c), but I'm a bit confused. Let me get the formula right.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 - v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for small v, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1. So lambda_obs ≈ lambda_emit (1 - v/c). Wait, but if the star is moving towards us (v positive), then the observed wavelength is shorter, so (1 - v/c) would be less than 1, thus blueshifted. So for Star_2, which has v=700 km/s, its observed wavelength is shorter than its emitted wavelength.

Wait, but in the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars. So:

lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1 * (1 - v1/c)
lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2
