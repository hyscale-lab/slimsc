Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but let's think this through.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal? Oh right, rhombohedral systems have all edges equal and all angles equal, or sometimes two angles equal and the third different. But in this case, all angles are 30 degrees. So it's a special case, maybe a cubic structure but with angles not 90 degrees. No, wait, no, it's a rhombohedral, not cubic. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a three-dimensional figure formed by six rhombi.

Interatomic distance is the distance between atoms. But wait, in a crystal, the interatomic distance depends on the structure. For example, in a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, the interatomic distance is aâˆš2/2, where a is the lattice parameter. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, the question actually gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. So maybe the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms? Wait, no, not necessarily. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance could be along a different direction, not necessarily the lattice parameter.
