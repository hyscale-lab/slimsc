Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms can tell us something about their temperature. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact details, so I'll have to think this through.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, so the excitation energy is related to temperature via the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor tells us the relative populations of energy levels. The formula I remember is something like the ratio of populations N_upper/N_lower = exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the population in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let me model this. Let's denote the ratio for star_1 as N1 and for star_2 as N2. So N1 = 2 * N2. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. The problem states that star_1's atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps N_upper/N_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, no, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So the excitation level is higher in star_1. So maybe the population in the excited state is higher in star_1. So N1 (excited) / N2 (excited) = 2? Or is it the ratio of the two populations for each star?

Wait, no. The question says that in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. So the excitation is higher in star_1. So the number of atoms in the excited state for star_1 is higher than for star_2. But the exact relationship might need to be set up correctly.

Alternatively, the ratio of the populations (excited to ground, maybe) is 2 for star_1 compared to star_2. So, (N_upper)_1 / (N_lower)_1 = 2 *
