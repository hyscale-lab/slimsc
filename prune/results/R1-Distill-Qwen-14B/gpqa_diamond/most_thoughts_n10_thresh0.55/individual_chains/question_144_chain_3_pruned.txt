Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X with given parameters. So what do I remember about particle physics and decay processes?

I think the decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. But wait, how do I connect the given parameters to the lifetime?

Oh right, the mean lifetime (tau) is related to the width (Gamma) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle states that the product of the energy uncertainty (which is Gamma here) and the time uncertainty (tau) is about h-bar over 2pi. Wait, actually, the formula I remember is Gamma multiplied by tau equals h-bar, but I need to get the exact relation right.

Wait, the formula for the mean lifetime tau is tau = h-bar / Gamma. Because the natural linewidth is Gamma, and the uncertainty in energy multiplied by uncertainty in time (which is the lifetime) equals h-bar / (2pi). But since Gamma is the width, which is 2pi times the uncertainty, maybe I should think again.

Alternatively, the mean lifetime tau is given by tau = (h-bar) / (Gamma). Because Gamma is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the lifetime in natural units.

So, let me get the constants right. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 JÂ·s, and h-bar is h divided by 2pi. So h-bar is approximately 1.0545718 x 10
