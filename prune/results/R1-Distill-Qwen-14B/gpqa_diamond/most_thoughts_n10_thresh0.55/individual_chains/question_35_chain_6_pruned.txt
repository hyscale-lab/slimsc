Okay, so I have this physics problem about angular momentum operators, specifically the Y-component Ay. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator and it's given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S has the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum components are represented by matrices, and their eigenvalues relate to the actual angular momentum values.

So, first, I think I need to write down what the matrix Ay looks like. Let's do that. The constant c is h/(4π), right? So multiplying each element of S by c. So Ay would be:

c * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Which becomes:

[[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

So that's the matrix of Ay.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The eigenvalue equation is Ay * φ = a * φ, where a is the eigenvalue, and φ is the eigenvector.

To find the eigenvalues, I should solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me set up the matrix (Ay - a I):

[ [ -a , -i*(h/(4π)) ],
  [ i*(h/(4π)) , -a ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i*(h/(4π)))(i*(h/(4π))) ]

Calculating that:

= a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (h²/(16π²)) * 1.

So the equation is:

a² - (h²)/(16π²) = 0

Wait, no, wait. Because the determinant is (a²) - ( (-i(h/(4π)) ) * (i (h/(4π)) ) ), which is a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h^2/(16 π²)) ]

But (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes:

a² - (1 * h²/(16 π²)) = 0

So a² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π) * (1/2) ?

Wait, wait: sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4π). Because sqrt(16) is 4, sqrt(π²) is π, so yes.

Wait, no. Wait, sqrt( (h/(4π))² ) is h/(4π). So a is plus or minus h/(4π) * 1/2?

Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate.

Wait, wait a second. The determinant equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²) => a = ±
