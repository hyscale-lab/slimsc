Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with stars in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. 

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in a particular energy state. In LTE, the number of atoms in an excited state is given by the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is N2/N1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where N2 is the number in higher energy level, N1 is lower, E2-E1 is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. So E is 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote E2 - E1 as this value, delta E.

Star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. So for star_1, N2_1 = 2 * N2_2. Wait, no, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So for the same energy level, the ratio N2_N1 (for star_1) is 2 times that of star_2. So N2_1 / N1_1 = 2 * (N2_2 / N1_2).

Wait, actually, wait. Let me parse that again. "Iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe N2_1 = 2 * N2_2. Hmm, but I think in the Boltzmann equation, it's N2/N1, which is the ratio of atoms in the higher energy level to the lower. So if star_1 has a higher ratio, that would imply a different temperature.

So for each star, the ratio is N2/N1 = exp( - delta E / (k T) )

So for star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the number of excited atoms in star_1's level is twice that in star_2's. So N2_1 = 2 N2_2.

But using the Boltzmann equation, N2/N1 = exp( - delta E / (k T) )

So for each star,

For star_1: N2_1 / N1_1 = exp( - delta E / (k T_1) )

For star_2: N2_2 / N1_2 = exp( - delta E / (k T_2) )

But the problem says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio of N2_1 to N2_2 is 2. So (N2_1) = 2 * (N2_2).

But N2_1/N1_1 equals exp(-delta E/(k T1)), and N2_2/N1_2 equals exp(-delta E/(k T2)).

Wait, but perhaps in each star, the ratio is N2_i / N1_i = exp(...), and the question is comparing N2_1 to N2_2. So the ratio (N2_1 / N1_1) = 2 * (N2_2 / N1_2) )? Or wait, maybe the problem is that the number in the excited level for star_1 is twice that for star_2, but for the same level, their N2 depends on T.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio between the two stars. Let me denote ratio R1 = N2_1/N1_1 = exp(-delta E/(k T1)), and R2 = N2_2/N1_2 = exp(-delta E/(k T2)).

The problem states that in star_1, the number of atoms in the specific energy level is twice that of star_2. Wait, wait—no, the question says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So N2_1 = 2 * N2_2.

But wait, N2_1 and N2_2 are the number of atoms in the excited level for each star. But that might not directly relate to the ratios R1 and R2, which are N2_i/N1_i. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach it is to take the ratio of R1 to R2. Because R1 is (N2_1/N1_1) and R2 is (N2_2/N1_2). So R1/R2 would be (N2_1 N1_2) / (N2_2 N1_1) ). But maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps in each star, the ratio N2_i/N1_i is given by the Boltzmann factor. So,

R1 = exp( - delta E / (k T1) )

R2 = exp( - delta E / (k T2) )

The problem states that N2_1 = 2 N2_2. But wait, no—because N2_1 is the number of atoms in the excited state for star_1, N2_2 is the same for star_2. But without knowing N1_1 and N1_2, perhaps we can't directly compare N2_1 and N2_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the same lower energy level (N1) for both stars. Let me think. If star_1 has twice the number of atoms in the higher energy level compared to star_2, then:

N2_1 = 2 N2_2.

But N2_1 = R1 * N1_1,

N2_2 = R2 * N1_2.

Assuming that the total number of atoms (N1 + N2) is the same for both stars, perhaps? Or maybe N1_1 and N1_2 are the same? I'm not sure, but maybe it's not necessary for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the two R values is given by (N2_1 / N2_2) = (R1 N1_1) / (R2 N1_2), but I don't think we have information about N1_1 and N1_2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the ratio of excitation is R1/R2 = 2. Because if N2_1 = 2 N2_2, and assuming that N1_1 = N1_2, then R1 = 2 R2. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to take the ratio of the two R values:

R1 / R2 = [exp( -delta E/(k T1) )] / [exp( -delta E/(k T2) ) ] = exp( delta E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

And R1/R2 = 2/1, because star_1 has twice the excitation.

Wait, but wait, if R1 is for star_1 and R2 for star_2, then if N2_1 = 2 N2_2, and assuming that the lower level populations N1 are the same for both stars, then R1 = 2 R2. So R1/R2 = 2.

So let's set up that equation: R1/R2 = 2.

But R1/R2 = [exp(-delta E/(k T1)) ] / [exp( -delta E/(k T2) ) ] = exp( delta E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So:

exp( delta E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Taking natural log on both sides:

delta E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Rearranging:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = (k ln 2) / delta E

But wait, the problem gives delta E as 1.38e-23 J. Let me check what k is. Boltzmann's constant is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's interesting. So k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So let's substitute:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ( (1.38e-23 J/K) * ln(2) ) / (1.38e-23 J )

Oh wait! The (1.38e-23) in numerator and denominator cancel each other out. So:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

But wait, 1/T2 - 1/T1 is the same as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Because:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So substituting back, we have:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

Hmm, but looking at the options, let me see:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which is the same as our equation.

But wait, looking back, the equation we derived is (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2). That would be:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

So the equation is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2), which is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, but wait, looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Yes, that matches.

Wait, but let me think again. Because when we set R1/R2 = 2, and then arrived at 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2 )

Wait, but 1/T2 - 1/T1 is same as -(1/T1 - 1/T2) = ln(2 )

Which would imply (1/T1 - 1/T2) = - ln(2 )

But our earlier step was:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2 )

Which is correct because R1/R2 is 2, leading to that.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, if T2 is higher than T_1, then the exponent would be more negative, leading to a smaller R2. So if R1 is larger than R2, that would require T1 < T2. Because higher temperature would lower the exponent (since delta E is positive and T is in denominator), so R increases with higher T. So if T1 is lower than T2, then R1 would be larger than R2. So the ratio R1/R2 = 2 implies that T1 is lower than T2.

But the equation (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2 ) implies that (T1 - T2) = T1 T2 ln(2 )

Wait, let me compute:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T1 - T2 = T1 T2 ln(2 )

Which is the same as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Which is exactly option D.

So the correct equation is D.


To determine the relationship between the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the population of atoms in different energy levels under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation is:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( N_2 \) and \( N_1 \) are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

The problem states that the number of iron atoms in the excited energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2, i.e., \( N_2^{(1)} = 2 N_2^{(2)} \). Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratios of excited to ground state populations for the two stars are:

\[
\frac{N_2^{(1)}}{N_1^{(1)}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{N_2^{(2)}}{N_1^{(2)}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio of these two equations:

\[
\frac{\frac{N_2^{(1)}}{N_1^{(1)}}}{\frac{N_2^{(2)}}{N_1^{(2)}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \( N_2^{(1)} = 2 N_2^{(2)} \), the ratio simplifies to:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{\ln(2) \cdot k}{\Delta E}.
\]

Boltzmann's constant \( k \) is approximately \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), and the energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
