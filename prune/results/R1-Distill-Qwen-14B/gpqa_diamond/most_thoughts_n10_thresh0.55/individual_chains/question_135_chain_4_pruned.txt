Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is about the allowed decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think this is a Yukawa interaction term. Yukawa couplings usually describe the interaction between fermions and bosons, like how a Higgs field interacts with fermions to give them mass.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, the question is about the possible decay products of X at the lowest order. I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the energy (or mass) of the boson must be at least twice the mass of each fermion. Because energy and mass are related via E=mc², so the rest mass of the fermions must be less than half the mass of X.

Wait, X has a mass of 6 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Because each fermion would have to be at least half that, right? Because for two particles, their rest masses add up, but if they are produced at rest, their total energy is 2m. So the sum of the fermion masses must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

So each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV because 2m < 6 GeV → m < 3 GeV.

Now, let's look at the known fermion masses. I think the masses of the quarks and leptons are as follows:

- Up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are much less than 1 GeV. So 2m is way below 6 GeV. So uū and dđ pairs are allowed. But wait, wait, the up quark is about 2.2 MeV, down is about 4.7 MeV. So their masses are way below 3 GeV. So their pairs can be decay products.

Next, the strange quark is around 95-100 MeV, but wait, wait—no, wait, no! Wait, no. No, wait. I'm getting confused. Wait, no, the strange quark is around 1
