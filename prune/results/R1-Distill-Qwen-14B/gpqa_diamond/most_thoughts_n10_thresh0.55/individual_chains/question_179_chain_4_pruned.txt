Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about matrices and their properties in quantum mechanics. There are four matrices given: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix, and the options are about statements related to these matrices. I need to choose the correct statement.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about each one and the relevant concepts.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the evolution operator is a unitary matrix. So maybe I can use these properties to evaluate the options.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. The exponential of a matrix e^X would result in some matrix. For the norm to change, e^X might not be unitary. Wait, but if X is a Hermitian matrix, then e^X would be unitary only if X is skew-Hermitian, right? Or wait, no. Let me think. The exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary because (iX)† = -iX, so e^(-iX) is unitary. But X here isn't necessarily Hermitian or skew-Hermitian.

Wait, perhaps I should check whether X is Hermitian. Let me compute X† and see if it equals X.

Matrix X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† is the conjugate transpose.

The conjugate of X's first row is (-i, -1, -2i)
Second row: (1, 0, 1)
Third row: (-2i, -1, i)

So X† would be:

[-i, 1, 2i]
[-1, 0, -1]
[2i, 1, i]

Wait, no. Wait, X is:

First row: [i, -1, 2i]
Second row: [1, 0, 1]
Third row: [2i, -1, -i]

So when we take
