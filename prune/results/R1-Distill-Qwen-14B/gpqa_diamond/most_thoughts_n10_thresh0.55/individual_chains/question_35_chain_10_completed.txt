Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it.

The problem says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S has a specific form. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I can write S as:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay is c multiplied by this S matrix. So:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, and then determine which of the given statements (A-D) is correct.

First, I think I should find the eigenvalues of Ay. For that, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

So let's compute Ay - a I:

Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so:

Ay - a I = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] - [[a, 0], [0, a]]

Which simplifies to:

= [[ -a, (h/(4π))*(-i) ],
   [ (h/(4π))*i, -a ] ]

Wait, actually, wait. Let me compute each element correctly. The (1,1) element is (h/(4π))*0 - a = -a. The (1,2) element is (h/(4π))*(-i), right? Similarly, the (2,1) element is (h/(4π))*i, and (2,2) is -a.

So the matrix is:

[ [-a, -(i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant is the product of the diagonal elements minus the product of the off-diagonal elements. So det = (-a)(-a) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

Let me compute each part.

The diagonal product: a^2.

The off-diagonal product: (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) = (i * -i) * (h^2)/(16 π² )

i * (-i) equals -i². i squared is -1, so this is -(-1) = 1. So the off-diagonal product is (h²)/(16 π²) * 1.

So the determinant is a² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) * 1 ] = 0.

Set this equal to zero for eigenvalues:

a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0 → a² = (h²)/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π)

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4 π) and a = -h/(4 π).

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation because S is given, but I'm a bit confused about the matrix structure. Alternatively, perhaps S is related to the Pauli matrices. Oh, right! The Pauli matrices. The S matrix looks like the sigma_y matrix multiplied by some factor.

Wait, the sigma_y Pauli matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So S is actually sigma_y.

So Ay is c * sigma_y. With c = h/(4 π).

So sigma_y has eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues would be ±c.

So indeed, the eigenvalues of Ay are ± (h/(4 π)).

So looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues we found are real. So option A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Also doesn't fit, since our eigenvalues are real numbers. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. A² is the square of the angular momentum. Since Ay and Az are components of the angular momentum, which are different operators. In quantum mechanics, for orbital angular momentum, the ladder operators are used, but here it's spin-½ particles, so the spin matrices are involved.

Wait, the square of the angular momentum operator is A² = (Ay)^2 + (Az)^2 + (Ax)^2. Wait, no, more accurately, A² is the sum of squares of all components. But for a spin-1/2 particle, A² is (ħ/2)^2 * 3, because for spin s, A² = s(s+1) ħ². Wait, muon is a lepton, so its spin is 1/2. So A² should have eigenvalues ( (1/2)(1/2 +1 ) ) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². But wait, the given operator is Ay, which is a component. So for any state that is an eigenstate of Ay, what about A²? Since A² is a Casimir operator, it commutes with all components, so the same eigenstates would be eigenstates of A².

But the statement in option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which I think is correct. But it says they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. Hmm.

Wait, but if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, can it also be an eigenstate of Az? Let's think. For a spin-½ system, the eigenstates of Ay are superpositions of the eigenstates of Az. So, for example, if |+y> is an eigenstate of Ay, then it's a combination of |+z> and |-z>. Therefore, |+y> is not an eigenstate of Az. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C's statement would be correct: the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So option C is a candidate.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure about that. Basis functions of the operator? Wait, the operator is represented in a certain basis. The eigenfunctions form a basis, but I'm not entirely sure what option D is saying. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Maybe it's referring to the fact that the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the space, which they do. But that's a general statement, not specific to this operator. So option D seems a bit ambiguous. I'm not certain about this.

Looking back, our eigenvalues are real: ±h/(4π). So looking at the options, the only possible correct statement about the eigenvalues is none of the options A or B. Because A and B are talking about having both real and imaginary parts, but our eigenvalues are purely real and equal to ±c.

So that leaves options C and D. Option C's first part says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So that part is correct. The second part says they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. As we discussed earlier, that's correct because if you're in an eigenstate of Ay, you're not in an eigenstate of Az. So option C seems correct.

Option D's statement is a bit confusing. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I think that refers to the matrix being diagonal in its eigenbasis, which is true. But the question is, does that make the statement correct? The eigenfunctions would form a basis for the operator, but perhaps the statement is trying to say that the operator's matrix is diagonal in that basis. I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is incorrect because the basis functions are the eigenfunctions, but the operator's own basis might not necessarily be the same as that.

So between options C and D, I think option C is correct. Let me double-check option D.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the operator has a matrix representation in the standard basis, but the eigenfunctions form a different basis (the eigenbasis), in which the operator is diagonal. So the eigenfunctions are a basis for the vector space, but they are not the same as the basis in which the operator is written as a matrix. So the statement in D is perhaps correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, but the question is whether they're the basis functions of the operator. I'm a bit confused by the wording. Alternatively, it's correct that the eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis, so they can be considered as the basis for the operator. Not sure.

But given that the other options are more clearly incorrect, and option C is correct, I'll go with option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \) because \( S \) is the Pauli \( \sigma_y \) matrix. Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are scaled by \( c \), giving:

\[
a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

These eigenvalues are real, not complex. Therefore, any option claiming the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is incorrect.

### Step 2: Analysis of the Options
- **Option A**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

- **Option B**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

- **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) is a Casimir operator that commutes with all components of \( \mathbf{A} \), so eigenstates of \( A_y \) are also eigenstates of \( A^2 \). However, eigenstates of \( A_y \) are not eigenstates of \( A_z \), as \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.

- **Option D**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is ambiguous but likely incorrect because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, but they are not the same as the basis in which \( A_y \) is represented as a matrix. The eigenfunctions are specific to the eigenbasis, not the operator's original basis.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).
