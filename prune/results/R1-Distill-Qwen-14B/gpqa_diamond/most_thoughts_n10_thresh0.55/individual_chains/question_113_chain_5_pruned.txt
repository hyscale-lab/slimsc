Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me three characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. I need to figure out which one it is.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad peak at around 3000 cm^-1. Oh wait, that's usually an O-H stretch. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a broad peak in FTIR is more indicative of an O-H in an alcohol or maybe a phenol. Carboxylic acids also have broad O-H, but sometimes they're even broader. Alright, so O-H is present.

Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a strong peak, which makes me think of a carbonyl group. Like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching in conjugated systems). Wait, but if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1700. Alternatively, 1700 could be an ester or ketone, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, maybe a C=C stretch in an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR: peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. So maybe it's an ester with a double bond or something like that.

Mass spec: Fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think. 45 could be a CH3 group attached to something else. Wait, wait, 45 is the molecular ion for (CH3)2O (dimethyl ether), but more likely, in organic compounds, 45 could be a fragment like from a ketone group or something else. Alternatively, 45 could correspond to a fragment like CH3CO+ (which is 43, wait, no: CH3CO would be 43, but maybe with an oxygen? Wait, perhaps a CH3O group? No, that's 31. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from a larger structure breaking down. For example, in an ester, like ethyl acetate. Let me think: the molecular formula of ethyl acetate is C4H8O2. Its molecular ion would be m/z 88. But if it fragments, maybe it breaks into smaller pieces. For example, the acetate part (CH3COO-) would be 60, but if the fragment is 45, perhaps that's a part of it. Or maybe a different structure.

Let me try to piece this together. So the compound has O-H (from the IR), a carbonyl (1700), and a double bond (from the vinyl H in NMR). So perhaps a structure with a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl, and a double
