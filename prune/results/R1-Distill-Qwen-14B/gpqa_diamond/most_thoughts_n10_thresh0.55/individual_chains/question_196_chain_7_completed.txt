Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But this is relativistic, so I guess I need to consider how relativity affects the motion, probably involving the speed of light, c.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are all expressions involving c, k, m, A, and some combinations. Let me think about how to approach this.

In classical mechanics, the maximum speed would come when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², so the maximum speed would be when that's equal to (1/2)mv². Solving for v would give v = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so that's probably not the case here.

Relativistic effects become significant when velocities approach the speed of light. So, I should think about the relativistic equations of motion or energy. In special relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But in an oscillator, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's the sum of kinetic and potential.

Wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential could be different. But the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx. So the potential is V(x) = (1/2)k x², same as classical. But the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)m v²; it's (gamma - 1) m c².

So the total energy E would be the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. Then, when the mass passes through x=0, all energy is kinetic. So I can set up the energy conservation equation.

At x = A: E = (1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c² + (1/2)k A²? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, at x=A, velocity is zero. So kinetic energy is zero. Potential energy is (1/2)k A². So E = (1/2)k A².

But wait, the total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy. Oh wait, no, in this context, I think E here refers to the total mechanical energy, which includes the rest mass energy. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

No, wait, in the relativistic oscillator, the total mechanical energy would be the sum of the rest energy (m c²) and the kinetic plus potential energy. Or perhaps not, because in classical mechanics, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But relativistically, kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

Wait, maybe the setup is that the oscillator's energy is quantized, but since this is a classical problem, perhaps we just have to consider the energy conservation.

Wait, perhaps in the relativistic case, the total energy E is given by E = m c² + (1/2)k A², since the maximum potential energy is (1/2)k A², and at x=0, all that energy is converted into kinetic, which is (gamma -1) m c².

So at maximum speed (x=0), the kinetic energy is E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c², and the potential is zero. So E_total is E_kinetic + E_potential. At x=A, E_total is (1/2)k A², but I'm not sure if that includes the rest mass energy.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. In classical mechanics, maximum speed is when all potential is converted to kinetic. In relativity, the total energy would be E = K + V, where K is the relativistic kinetic energy and V is the potential.

So when the mass is at amplitude A, it's at rest (v=0) so K = 0. The potential energy is (1/2)k A². So the total energy E = (1/2)k A².

When the mass is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, so E = K = (gamma - 1) m c².

So setting these equal: (gamma -1 ) m c² = (1/2)k A².

Solve for gamma: gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me write that as:

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as some term, say, alpha. So,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

But wait, if k A² is much larger than m c², then gamma could be large, but in reality, for a harmonic oscillator, not sure.

But I need to solve for v.

Let me rearrange that equation.

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [ (2 m c²) + k A^2 ] / (2 m c² )

Hmm, perhaps not helpful. Let me take reciprocals.

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(gamma) = 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)].

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/[ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ].

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/[ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ].

Let me factor that expression.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) = beta. So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2.

Simplify the right-hand side:

1 - [1/(1 + beta)^2] = [ (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2 beta + beta² -1 ) = 2 beta + beta².

So,

v²/c² = (2 beta + beta²) / (1 + beta)^2.

Approximate for small beta (if beta << 1), then beta squared is negligible, so numerator is 2 beta, denominator is 1. So v² is approximately 2 beta c², which would be (k A²)/(m) * (1/2) * 2, so (k A²)/(m) * (1/(2 m c²)) ) ? Wait, maybe not. Wait, beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). So 2 beta is (k A²)/(m c²). Then v^2/c^2 would be approximately (2 beta)/ (1) = 2 beta, so v ≈ c sqrt(2 beta) = c sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c²) ) ) = sqrt( k A^2/(m) ) * c * sqrt(1/(c^2)) )= sqrt( k A^2/(m) ) * c * 1/c? Wait, no, perhaps I messed that up.

Wait, sqrt( k A^2/(m) ) is sqrt(k/m) * A. Then, (k A^2)/(m c^2) is (k/m) (A^2/c^2). So sqrt(2 beta) is sqrt( (2 k A²)/(2 m c^2 * 2) )? Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed without approximation.

But let's get back to the expression we have:

v² = c² [ (2 beta + beta^2) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

But beta is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently.

Alternatively, maybe I can find v_max in terms of this.

But let's look at the options.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Wait, that would be:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + beta)^2] )

Which is what I have:

v^2 = c² (1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 )

So v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 )

Which is option D.

Wait, looking back, no. Option D is written as:

D) v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Hmm, that would match our expression. So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option A is c multiplied by sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m))^2 )

Hmm, that doesn't look right because in our expression, the denominator is (1 + beta), which is 1 plus a positive term, so 1 + beta is greater than 1. So 1/(1 + beta)^2 is less than 1, making 1 - 1/(something squared) positive.

Option B has 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m c^2)) inside the sqrt. Hmm, but in our expression, the denominator is 1 + beta, not 1 - beta.

Option C is sqrt(k A^2/m), which is the classical expression, but without relativity, so that's likely not correct.

So putting it all together, the correct expression is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the energy conservation. In this relativistic context, the total energy \( E \) is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy.

At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential:  
\[
E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]  
At \( x = 0 \), all energy is kinetic, given by:  
\[
E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
\]  
where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the total energy at \( x = A \) and \( x = 0 \):  
\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
\]  
Rearranging for \( \gamma \):  
\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]  
Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):  
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]  
Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:  
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]  
Rearranging for \( v^2 \):  
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]  
Taking the square root:  
\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]  

Now, comparing this result with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. It involves \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m} \) in the denominator, which does not match the derived expression.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It involves \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), which is inconsistent with the derived denominator \( 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \).
- **Option C**: Incorrect. This is the classical expression for maximum speed, which does not account for relativistic effects.
- **Option D**: Correct. It matches the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:  
**Answer: D**
