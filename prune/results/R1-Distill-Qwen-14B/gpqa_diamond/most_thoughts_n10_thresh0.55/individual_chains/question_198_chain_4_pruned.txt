Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in solution with thiocyanate. The concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants are used to determine the distribution of metal-ligand complexes in solution. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So, the higher the beta, the more the complex will form.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think that usually refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^n- complex, which is blue. But wait, I need to confirm the structure. Oh wait, maybe the dithiocyanato refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^(?) complex. But I'm not exactly sure about the charge here. But maybe that's not too important right now.

So, the main idea is to calculate the fraction of each possible Co complex and find out what percentage the dithiocyanato (specifically the blue one) contributes.

The possible complexes would be [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where n can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Wait no, because the stability constants given are β1 to β4, which suggests complexes up to four SCN- ligands. Wait, I think the stability constants are for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) complexes. So for each n, the beta is the formation constant for adding the nth ligand.

Wait, wait. The stability constant, β, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For example, for n=1, β1 is the constant for Co²+ + SCN⁻ → [CoSCN]⁺. Similarly, β2 would be for the next step. But actually, the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would be the stepwise constant for each ligand added. So the overall formation constant K for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n
