Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed is given by v = sqrt(kA^2/m), right? But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are different. 

I think in relativity, the maximum speed can't exceed the speed of light c. Oh right, so classical mechanics formulas might not apply here directly. Maybe I need to use relativistic energy considerations.

So the oscillator has mass m, amplitude A, and the force is F = -kx. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is U = (1/2)k x². But wait, in relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; there's the rest mass energy too.

In the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)k A² because at maximum displacement, all energy is potential. Then, the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (1/2)m v². So equating, (1/2)m v² = (1/2)k A² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but that's the non-relativistic case.

But the question is relativistic. So the energy can't be treated the same way. The total energy in relativity is gamma times mc². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So maybe I should set the total energy equal to gamma mc² and the potential energy is (1/2)k A².

Wait, but wait. The maximum potential energy would be when the oscillator is at x = A. So potential energy U = (1/2)k A². The kinetic energy at that point is zero, because it's the turning point. But wait, the maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic. So in the non-relativistic case, when x=0, the KE is max.

But in relativity, maybe the situation is different. Wait, no, the maximum speed should still occur when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium position, where all energy is kinetic. So maybe the total energy (which is conserved) would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy at that point.

Wait, no. Actually, the total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and the kinetic energy plus potential energy. But in SHM, the potential and kinetic energies oscillate. So perhaps in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy
