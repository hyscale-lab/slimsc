Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. Hmm, I remember that when transition metals form complexes with ligands, the stability constants (beta values) play a big role in determining the distribution of different complexes.

So, the setup is that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands attached, but here β3 is higher than β2, but β4 is lower than β3. That's a bit confusing. Oh well, maybe the complexes have different structures or maybe the numbering isn't based on the number of ligands. Hmm, perhaps we need to clarify. Oh, wait, the complexes are Co(SCN)_n, where n is the number of ligands. So for each n, βn is the stability constant for that complex.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I think dithiocyanato means two SCN ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^something. Let me think about the charge. Co^2+ with two SCN^- would form either [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but that's neutral. Or maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^ something else. Wait, cobalt is in +2 oxidation state, each SCN^- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^m+, the charge would be 2+ - n*(1-) = m+. If m is the charge of the complex. But maybe in solution, the complexes can have different charges, but perhaps the question refers to the neutral complex. I'm not entirely sure, but maybe the complexes are all neutral, so n would be 2 for Co^2+ because 2+ - 2*(-1) = 0. So the neutral complex is [Co(SCN)_2]?

Wait no, that's not right. Wait, Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So if the complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^k+, then the charge would be 2+ + n*(-1) = k+. For example, n=3 would give 2-3(1) = -1, so a -1 charge. Hmm, but I'm not sure how the complexes are arranged. Maybe that's not crucial right now. Let's get back to the problem.

The problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)2]^ something complex. So, the species we're interested in is the one with two SCN ligands attached. So, for that, the stability constant β2 is 40.

Wait no, wait. I think each βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN ligands. So β1 would be [CoSCN]/([Co][SCN]), β2 would be [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co][SCN
