Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of a polycyclic structure, maybe like a cage structure. So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead positions.

First reaction: heated with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so elimination maybe? But wait, when dihalides, especially vicinal dihalides (adjacent) react with strong bases, they usually undergo elimination to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the two Brs are not adjacent. Hmm. Wait, adamantane's structure is such that the positions are on opposite sides. So maybe it's a diepoxy structure? No, Br here. Oh, wait, maybe it's a dihalide that can undergo dehydrohalogenation, but the positions are 1 and 3, which are bridgehead positions. So elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3? But that might be a bit strained because adamantane is already a rigid structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination? Wait, no, with KOH and heat, perhaps it's an E2 mechanism. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but with two Brs, perhaps.

Wait, think about
