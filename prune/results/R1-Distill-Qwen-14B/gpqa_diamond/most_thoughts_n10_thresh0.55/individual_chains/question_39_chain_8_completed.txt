Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when measuring the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So, I think this has something to do with normalization of the wave function because the total probability should be 1.

Right, the wave function must be normalized, meaning the integral of the absolute square of the wave function from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. But wait, the wave function is a complex number here. Oh, right, the absolute square is the wave function multiplied by its complex conjugate.

So the wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me denote that as ψ(x) = A(x) + B(x)i, where A(x) = a/sqrt(1+x), and B(x) = -0.5. So the complex conjugate, ψ*(x), would be A(x) - B(x)i, which is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

The probability density is ψ*(x)ψ(x) = [A + 0.5i][A - 0.5i], wait no, wait. Actually, more accurately, the absolute square is |ψ(x)|² = (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a/sqrt(1+x) -0.5i) by (a/sqrt(1+x) +0.5i), you get (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Oh right, because when you multiply (c - di)(c + di) = c² + d².

So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

The integral of this from x=1 to x=3 should be 1.

So the integral ∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute each part. Integrate a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so a² times [ln(4) - ln(2)] because evaluating from x=1 (which is 2 inside ln) to x=3 (4 inside ln). Ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) is ln(2). So the first part is a² * ln(2).

The second part is the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3, which is 0.25*(3-1)=0.5.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, no, wait. Because the integral of the probability density must be 1, so:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, let me recheck that. The integral is [a² ln(4/2)] + 0.25*(3-1) = a² ln(2) + 0.5 * 2*0.25? Wait no, 0.25 * 2 is 0.5. So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, solving for a²:

a² = (1 - 0.5) / ln(2) = 0.5 / ln(2).

Let me compute that. What's ln(2) approximately? About 0.693147.

So 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a is the square root of 0.7213. Let's see, sqrt(0.7213) is approximately 0.849. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 0.85. That's close.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup. The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So when calculating |ψ|², I have (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, correct? Because the imaginary part is -0.5i, so the square of 0.5 is 0.25. Yes.

So integrating that from 1 to 3 gives a² ln(2) + 0.5*(3-1)*0.25? Wait, no, the integral of 0.25 from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5. So that part is correct.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² = (0.5)/ln(2) ≈ 0.5 /0.6931≈0.7213 → a ≈ 0.849, so 0.85 is the closest option. So option B is 0.85, which seems correct.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we normalize the wave function. The normalization condition requires that the total probability of finding the particle between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \) is 1. 

The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \psi^*(x)\psi(x) \), where \( \psi^*(x) \) is the complex conjugate of \( \psi(x) \). Since \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), its complex conjugate is \( \psi^*(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i \). Multiplying these gives:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), we have:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \): The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \), so:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 \, dx \): The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( x \) from 1 to 3 is:

\[
0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest value to \( 0.849 \) among the options is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
