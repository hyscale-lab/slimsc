Okay, I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

So the question says that two stars with the same mass (like our Sun) each have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The radial velocity (RV) method detected these planets. 

The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbital period. Oh right, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is something like K = (V) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (1 AU)^(1/3) ) ), but wait, maybe I'm getting the exact formula wrong. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the square root of the star's mass and directly proportional to the planet's mass and the orbital period's inverse cube? Or wait, perhaps the period is in the denominator raised to a certain power.

Wait, the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )^(1/ some exponent... Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for the RV semi-amplitude. Let me recall:
