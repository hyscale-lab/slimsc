Okay, so I've got a chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about titration, which I've been trying to get better at. Let me take it step by step.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85e-5.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to figure out what happens when we dilute the acetic acid. Diluting it will reduce its concentration. Oh wait, because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. So the initial concentration after dilution would be 0.05 M divided by 2, which is 0.025 M. Because volume doubles, right? So 20 cm³ becomes 40 cm³, so concentration halves.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³, and the moles of acetic acid remain the same. Moles of acetic acid = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, in 0.04 L (40 cm³), the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

So now, after dilution, the solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. 

The first part asks for the pH at 25% titration. Wait, 25% of what? Oh, I think it refers to 25% of the equivalence point volume. So we need to calculate how much NaOH is added at 25% of the equivalence point.

So, what's the equivalence point here? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So the moles of NaOH needed will be equal to the moles of acetic acid.
