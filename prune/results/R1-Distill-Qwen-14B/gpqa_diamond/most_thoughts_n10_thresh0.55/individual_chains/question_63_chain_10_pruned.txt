Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, the question is about what momentum a photon should have for the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state when it's in its fundamental state.

Let me think. The molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which I believe is the non-rigid rotor model, considering both rotation and vibration. But wait, the problem is about absorbing a photon to switch states. So this must be about a transition involving both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

Wait, no, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh, right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So maybe the next state is the first excited state, which would be the next higher energy state.

Wait, but in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and have specific formulas. For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels for both rotation and vibration contribute to the total energy.

So the molecule's energy could be in various states. The fundamental state would have the lowest possible vibrational and rotational energies. The next state would probably be the next vibrational level, or maybe a higher rotational state. But the question is about the photon's momentum needed for the transition.

Wait, the question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state after the fundamental state would be the next higher energy state, which could be a higher vibration state, or a combination of higher rotation and same vibration.

Wait, but in the vibrational energy levels, the fundamental state is n=0 for vibration. The first excited vibrational state is n
