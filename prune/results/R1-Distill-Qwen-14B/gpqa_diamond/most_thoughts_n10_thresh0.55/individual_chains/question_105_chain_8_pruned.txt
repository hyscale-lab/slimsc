Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem is about a star similar to the Sun. It has spots on one hemisphere, which cover 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The question is about photometric observations, which measure the brightness over time. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. These variations can look like the transit of an exoplanet. 

The question is asking, if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet, what radius would the planet need to have to create the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do. So, we need to compare the effect of the spots on the light curve to what a planet would do.

Hmm. I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets measures the dip in brightness when a planet passes in front of the star. The larger the planet relative to the star, the bigger the dip. So the amplitude of the variation depends on the ratio of the areas (since area is proportional to R squared). But in this case, the spots are causing a variation, and we need to find the equivalent planet radius that would cause the same dip.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears dimmer. So the variation is a decrease in brightness when the spots are in view. Conversely, when the planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, leading to a decrease in brightness. So both situations cause a dip, so the amplitudes should be comparable.

But let me think about the details. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So first, what's the total area of the spots? Let's see.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. The star's surface area is 4πRstar², but since the spots are on one hemisphere, that's 2πRstar². But the filling factor is the fraction of that hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π Rstar²) = 0.4 π Rstar².

Wait no, wait. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface where the spots are. So if it's
