Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is saying.

The problem states: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. The 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system.

Hmm, right. So each particle has a charge of 2e. I remember that e is the elementary charge, about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 * 1.602e-19 C, which is 3.204e-19 C. But wait, the problem is about potential energy, so I need to calculate the potential energy of the system.

Wait, the system is isolated, which probably means we consider all the interactions within the system. The 13th charge is fixed, so maybe it's stationary, and the other 12 are moving around but constrained at 2 meters from P. So each of those 12 charges is 2e and located 2 meters away from P. The 13th is at P.

Wait, but how are the 12 charges arranged? Are they all at the same point 2 meters from P, or are they arranged in some symmetrical way? Because the potential energy would depend on their positions relative to each other and to the fixed charge.

But wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each is at a distance of 2 meters from P. But their positions relative to each other could vary. Oh, but the question is about the minimum energy, so maybe the potential energy is minimized when the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes their mutual repulsion. Wait, but wait, since all the 12 charges are the same sign, they repel each other. So to minimize their potential energy, perhaps they should be as far apart as possible given the constraints.

Wait, but in this setup, the 12 charges are each fixed at 2 meters from P. So the distance between any two of them would vary depending on where they are placed on the sphere of radius 2 meters. The potential energy between two charges depends on their separation. So for the minimum potential energy
