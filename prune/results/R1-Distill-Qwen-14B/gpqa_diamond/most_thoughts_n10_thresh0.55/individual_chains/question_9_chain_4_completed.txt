Okay, so I've got this question about symmetry in molecules. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules is classified using point groups. The C3h group is one of them. I think C3h is a type of symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Wait, or maybe it's a combination of a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror? I'm a bit confused about the exact definitions. Let me recall: Oh right, C3h has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric across a mirror plane that's horizontal relative to the main axis.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. The name suggests a tricyclic structure with three furan rings, perhaps arranged symmetrically.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Another tricyclic compound, maybe with benzene rings attached. I'm not sure about the structure, but the numbering suggests it's a fused ring system.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. That's a borate ester, specifically with three isopropyl groups attached to the boron. The structure is like a trigonal planar around boron, with each isopropyl group attached. So, each isopropyl is a substituent.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, I think. Its structure is a norbornane-like structure, which is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So it's a bridged bicyclic compound. I remember that norbornane has a certain symmetry, but I'm not sure about quinuclidine's.

Let me think about each option's symmetry.

Starting with triisopropyl borate (Option C). The molecule has a boron at the center, connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a substituent. The structure is trigonal planar around boron, so the molecule is symmetric with a three-fold axis (C3) through the boron. Now, is there a horizontal mirror plane? Well, the molecule is symmetrical when you rotate it 120 degrees, but what about reflection? Since all three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, there should be a plane of symmetry. But wait, the mirror plane for C3h is horizontal relative to the rotation axis. In this case, the rotation axis is perpendicular to the mirror plane. So if the molecule is flat, like all substituents are in the same plane, then yes, a mirror plane exists. But boron is in a trigonal planar geometry, so all the isopropyl groups are in the same plane. So the molecule should have a C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait: triisopropyl borate's structure is like [B(isopropyl)3]. So that's a trigonal planar molecule. It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane. The mirror plane in this case would be the plane that contains the rotation axis and is perpendicular to it. Wait, no. The C3h point group includes a horizontal mirror, which is a plane that is perpendicular to the rotation axis. So if the rotation axis is the C3, then the mirror plane would be horizontal relative to that axis. So in triisopropyl borate, the molecule is planar, and the mirror plane would be the same as the plane of the molecule. So if you reflect it across that plane, it looks the same. So yes, that would make it C3h.

Now, quinuclidine (Option D). Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, I think it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system. Its structure has a bridge, so the molecule is quite rigid. The symmetry of quinuclidine... I think it has a C3 axis, but I'm not sure about the mirror planes. Alternatively, maybe it's tetrahedral or something else. Wait, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, and I think it has a certain symmetry. Quinuclidine is a hydrogenated version, but similar structure. I'm not sure about the point group here. Maybe it's C2v or something else. But I don't think it has C3h symmetry. Because the molecule is bicyclic, it's more likely to have lower symmetry.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, the name suggests fused rings. Let me imagine: three furan rings fused together, each sharing two adjacent atoms. The numbering is a bit complicated, but perhaps it's a tricyclic structure. For a molecule like this, the symmetry would depend on how the rings are arranged. If it's a symmetrical arrangement, maybe it has a three-fold axis. Alternatively, I'm not sure. For example, if the rings are arranged in such a way that rotating 120 degrees brings the molecule back to itself, it would have a C3 axis. But does it also have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetric in that way, then it could have C3h symmetry. Alternatively, it might have a higher symmetry group, but I'm not certain.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. This seems similar to option B but with different substituents. The "triphenylene" part suggests that the rings are attached to phenyl groups. So perhaps this molecule has three furan rings connected in a way that gives it a three-fold symmetry. If each substituent is the same, then a C3 axis would be present. But does it have a mirror plane? Again, if the substituents are in a symmetric arrangement, then a mirror plane could exist, making it C3h.

Wait, but I'm trying to recall known molecules. Triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way. It has D3h symmetry, I think. D3h is a higher symmetry group than C3h. So if a molecule is based on triphenylene, perhaps it has higher symmetry. So if that's the case, perhaps option A is D3h, which includes C3h as a subgroup, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on the furan rings in option A are arranged in such a way that the molecule's symmetry is lower.

Let me go back to the options. The question is about which has C3h symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate (Option C): As I thought earlier, it's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So it has a C3 rotation axis. Does it have a mirror plane? Yes, because the molecule is symmetrical across the plane perpendicular to the C3 axis. So that would make it C3h.

Wait, but wait: The C3h group has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So the mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis. So for triisopropyl borate, the molecule is flat, so the mirror plane is the same as the trigonal plane. So the reflection is a symmetry operation. Hence, it should have C3h symmetry.

What about quinuclidine (Option D)? Its structure is bicyclo[2.2.1], which is a bridge. I think it has a three-fold axis. Wait, no. Let me think about the structure. Quinuclidine has a bridge between two carbons, making a bicyclic structure. The molecule is symmetric across three planes, perhaps. Wait, is it? The molecule has a bridge, so the symmetry would be lower. I think quinuclidine has a C2 symmetry. Because when you rotate it 180 degrees, it looks the same. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's C3. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, let's think about each option's point group.

Triisopropyl borate: The molecule is trigonal planar with three identical substituents. So its point group should be D3h. Because D3h includes a C3 axis, three C2 axes, and a horizontal mirror plane. But wait, D3h is a larger group than C3h. So if the molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror, then it's D3h, which includes C3h. So perhaps the correct answer is not triisopropyl borate because it has higher symmetry.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because D3h includes C3h as a subgroup, but the question is about which has C3h symmetry. So a molecule that's D3h would have C3h symmetry, but there might be others that also have C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate is not in a plane, so maybe it's not C3h. Wait, no, the molecule is planar. Because the boron is in the center, with three isopropyl groups all in the same plane. So the molecule is flat, so it's trigonal planar. So yes, it has a horizontal mirror plane.

But wait, another consideration: The mirror plane in C3h is a horizontal plane. So for a flat molecule, the mirror plane would be the same as the molecular plane. So in that case, the mirror plane is present, making the point group C3h. Or maybe D3h because of the other symmetry elements.

Wait, maybe I should get back to the basics.

Point groups:

C3h: has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror (σh) plane perpendicular to it.

D3h: has a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to it in the plane, and a horizontal mirror plane. So D3h includes C3h as a subgroup.

So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it also has C3h symmetry. But the question is which of the options has C3h symmetry. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it would satisfy the condition of having C3h symmetry, but perhaps another option only has C3h and not higher.

Alternatively, triisopropyl borate might have D3h symmetry because of the three-fold axis and mirror planes. But maybe the other options have C3h.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the other options.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The structure is a trifuran with benzo substituents. The naming suggests that each furan is connected to a benzene ring. Let me imagine this as three benzene rings connected in a symmetrical way around a central point. If each benzene is in a symmetric position, the molecule could have a three-fold axis. But does it have a mirror plane? If each of the three substituents is a benzene, and they are arranged symmetrically, that would imply a horizontal mirror plane. So the point group would be D3h, perhaps, similar to triphenylene. So if that's the case, option B would have D3h symmetry.

Option A: triphenyleno...trifuran. So the substituents are phenyl groups attached to the trifuran. If the structure is similar to triphenylene, which has D3h symmetry, then option A's molecule might also have D3h symmetry.

Option D: quinuclidine. I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis. Wait, no, I think it's C2v. Wait, norbornane has a C2h symmetry, but quinuclidine (the amine) might have a C2v. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a three-fold axis because of the bridge structure. Wait, no, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1], which has two methyl groups in a symmetric position. Quinuclidine's structure is similar but with a bridge. Wait, if you look at the structure, it's a bridged bicyclic amine. So the molecule might have a C3 axis, but I'm not sure about the mirror planes.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is the correct answer because it has the C3h symmetry. Or maybe none of them except C.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach it differently. I'll consider each option's structure and their possible symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate (Option C): Structure is B with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is connected to B. The molecule is planar, trigonal, so yes, three-fold rotation (C3). Also, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that's perpendicular to the C3 axis. So it has C3h symmetry, maybe even D3h if there are other mirror planes.

Quinuclidine (Option D): Structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane with an NH. The structure is a bridged compound. Let me imagine it as a norbornane-like structure with an NH group. The symmetry here is C2v, I think. Because the molecule has a mirror plane, but only a two-fold rotation axis. So the point group would be C2v, which doesn't include C3h.

Option B: benzo[...]-trifuran. The molecule is a tricyclic system. The substituents are benzene rings attached to each furan ring. If the three substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane. So it's D3h symmetry, which includes C3h.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]-trifuran. Triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way, forming a larger ring. So when you attach this to a trifuran, the substituents might be arranged in a way that the overall molecule has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, leading to D3h symmetry.

So, the question is which of these has C3h symmetry.

If triisopropyl borate (Option C) has D3h symmetry, then it also has C3h. But perhaps another molecule in the options has exactly C3h and not a higher symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran...

B) benzo[...]trifuran...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

Which of these has C3h symmetry.

So if triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h, then it would satisfy the condition. But the question is about which molecule has C3h. So if any of them have C3h, including those with higher symmetry, it would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenyleno... (Option A) has D3h, so it would have C3h.

But the question is to choose which one has C3h symmetry.

Wait, another approach: C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So in the molecule, it should look the same after a 120 rotation and also be symmetric across a mirror plane.

Now, considering each option:

Option C: triisopropyl borate. It is symmetric with a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror. So yes, it has C3h.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran. It might have D3h symmetry.

Option A: triphenyleno... may also have D3h.

So perhaps the correct answer is Option C, triisopropyl borate, which has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait: Another thought. Triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule with three identical substituents. So it's trigonal planar, and has a C3 axis. The mirror plane would be the same as the plane of the molecule, so a σh plane exists. So yes, it has C3h symmetry.

But then, if the question is about which has C3h, then Option C would be the correct answer. However, I'm a bit confused because I thought it might have D3h symmetry because it's planar and has more symmetry elements. But D3h is a higher symmetry group, which includes C3h, but the question is simply asking which has C3h. So any of the options with C3h symmetry would be correct, regardless of higher symmetry.

Wait, but the options are given, and the answer is one of them.

So, putting it all together:

Option C: triisopropyl borate. It has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane. So it has C3h symmetry. So the answer should be C.

Alternatively, I'm thinking that perhaps triisopropyl borate is a good candidate.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the symmetry of the other options. Let me think again.

Option D: quinuclidine. I think it has C2v symmetry, which does not include a three-fold axis. So it doesn't have C3h.

Option B and A: Both are tricyclic compounds with three substituents. If they have three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, they would have a C3 axis and a mirror plane, leading to C3h or higher symmetry.

But for the purpose of this question, the only option that definitely has C3h is Option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze each option based on its structure and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry consists of a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) perpendicular to the rotation axis. Here's the analysis for each option:

---

### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule is a tricyclic compound with three furan rings and phenyl substituents arranged symmetrically. The structure suggests a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) due to the symmetric arrangement of the substituents. Additionally, a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) is likely present, making this molecule compatible with **D₃h** symmetry, which includes **C₃h** as a subgroup. However, the question specifically asks for **C₃h** symmetry, and while this molecule has higher symmetry (D₃h), it still satisfies the condition of having **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule is another tricyclic compound with three furan rings and benzene substituents. Similar to Option A, the substituents are arranged symmetrically, suggesting a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). A horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) is also present, leading to **D₃h** symmetry. Like Option A, this molecule has **C₃h** symmetry as part of its higher symmetry group.

---

### **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate**
This molecule consists of a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups in a trigonal planar geometry. The molecule has a clear three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) perpendicular to the rotation axis. This combination directly corresponds to **C₃h** symmetry. Additionally, the molecule does not have any higher symmetry elements, so its symmetry group is exactly **C₃h**.

---

### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a structure similar to norbornane. Its symmetry is lower, with a **C₂v** point group. This symmetry does not include a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) or a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), so it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### Conclusion
Both Options A and B have **D₃h** symmetry, which includes **C₃h** as a subgroup. Option C, triisopropyl borate, has exactly **C₃h** symmetry without any additional symmetry elements. Option D does not have **C₃h** symmetry. Therefore, the molecule with **C₃h** symmetry is **triisopropyl borate**.

**Answer: C**
