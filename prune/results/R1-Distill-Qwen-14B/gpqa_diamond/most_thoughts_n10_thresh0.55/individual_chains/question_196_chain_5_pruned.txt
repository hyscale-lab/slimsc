Okay, so I've got this problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, the harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. But wait, this is relativistic, so I have to think about how special relativity affects things.

The question is about the maximum speed of the mass. In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and when x is at maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is (1/2)m v², so setting them equal gives v = sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C is that expression. But wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so the classical formula might not hold.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The total energy is gamma times mc², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². So when the oscillator is at maximum speed, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but relativistically.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The potential energy in the relativistic harmonic oscillator—does it change? I think the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So the total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (x=A), the kinetic energy is zero, and all energy is potential: E = (1/2)k
