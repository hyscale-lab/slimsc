Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the Michael addition reaction. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The reaction typically forms a new carbon-carbon bond. 

The problem gives three separate reactions (A, B, and C) and asks which option correctly lists the reactants and major products for each. There are four options (A to D) to choose from.

Let me break down each part.

First, Reaction A:
The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So, what's happening here?

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. The enolate form is stabilized by the two ester groups. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would have the acrylate part (CH2=CHCOOEt), but the p-tolyl (a methyl group attached to a benzene ring) is at the 3-position. Wait, actually, the substituents on the double bond might affect the regiochemistry. Since it's E, the substituents are opposite each other.

In a Michael addition, the enolate attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate.

Wait, but wait, dimethyl malonate itself is the enolate here. So the enolate would have a negative charge on the alpha carbon (the middle one of the malonate). The acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OEt, but with the p-tolyl group in the E configuration. Hmm, maybe the structure is CH2-C-(p-tolyl)=CHCOOEt? Wait, no, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the middle carbon, so it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOEt. Wait, no, the acrylate is CH2CH2COOEt. No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon? Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon, but that can't be right because the acrylate is only three carbons: CH2-CH2-CO-OEt. Oh wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-p-tolylacry
