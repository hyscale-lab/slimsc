Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to think through, and I want to make sure I understand it correctly before jumping to the answer. Let me break it down.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, right? So mathematically, that's number of stars (N) = 1 / (parallax)^5. Parallax is usually denoted by 'plx', I think. So N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Now, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So we're looking for the relationship between N and r. Hmm.

Wait, parallax and distance are inversely related. I remember that parallax (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if distance increases, parallax decreases. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So substituting plx with 1/d, since plx = 1/d. Let me rewrite the expression for N in terms of d. Since N ∝ 1/plx^5, substituting plx = 1/d, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Simplifying that: (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1 divided by that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of d. But wait, that doesn't sound right. Because if you go further away, you might expect fewer stars, but maybe not... Oh wait, no, actually, the number of stars you can see at a certain distance would depend on how many are present at that distance. But this question is about the observed number varying with parallax in that way.

Wait, no, the question is about how the number of stars in that region changes with distance. So maybe it's about the number density, like stars per unit volume or something. Or perhaps it's about the number of stars in a shell at distance r. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit
