Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, I remember that NMR can give a lot of structural information, so I'll start by analyzing that.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, which are zero here. So, substituting: (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5, but wait that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I should do it correctly. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C is 8, H is 9, X=0, N=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a ring plus double bonds or triple bonds. 

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait,
