Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. The reaction steps are as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints given:
a) When compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it produces 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclic ketones. So, the final compound E is a ketone. Let me break this down.

First, the IR data. A peak around 1750 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, probably an ester or a ketone. Since E's peak is at 1715, which is a bit lower, that could indicate a ketone (since esters are usually higher, like around 1730-1760). Wait, but wait: sometimes the exact position can vary based on structure. But let's remember that.

Looking at the reaction steps. Starting from A, which reacts with HCN to form B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups, like in a ketone, to form cyanohydrins. So if A is a ketone, then B is a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, but the IR suggests a ketone. So, let's assume A is a cyclic ketone.

So, A is a cyclic ketone. Then B would be a cyanohydrin—so a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached adjacent to the hydroxyl group. Then, when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, that's probably a catalytic hydrogenation. In such a case, the nitrile group (from the HCN addition) would be reduced. Nitriles reduce to amines when using something like H2 with a catalyst that can do that, but wait—Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So, hydrogenolysis perhaps. Wait, sometimes H2 and Pd reduces nitriles to amines. Or maybe in the presence of other conditions, like acidic or basic, but here it's just H2 and Pd.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. HCN adds to a ketone to make a cyanohydrin. The structure would be something like R-C(OH)-CN. Then, when we hydrogenate that, under H2 and Pd, what happens? The nitrile (CN) group would be reduced to an amine (CH2NH2?), but wait, no. Wait, H2 and Pd would typically reduce nitriles to amines, but that might require specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenolysis of the nitrile group to a CH2NH2 group. Or maybe the nitrile is first converted to an imine, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another thought: when a nitrile is hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, it's more likely to be reduced to an amine. So, the nitrile group (RCN) becomes RCH2NH2. Alternatively, maybe in this case, the cyanohydrin (which is R-C(OH)-CN) upon hydrogenation would have the nitrile group converted to an amine, and perhaps the hydroxyl group also gets reduced? Wait, but Pd is usually for hydrogenation of double bonds, not necessarily for reducing hydroxyl groups. Unless it's under high pressure or something else.

Hmm, maybe I should think of what B looks like. So, A is a ketone. Let's say A is cyclopentanone, for example.
