Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I think the decay distance depends on the lifetime of the meson. Oh right, because the mean decay length is how far the particle travels before it decays. So the formula should involve the lifetime multiplied by the velocity and the energy, maybe?

First, I need to find the lifetime of the meson. I remember that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the width (Γ) to the lifetime (τ). The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But I'm not sure if that's exactly the case here. Oh wait, Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. Or is it τ = ħ / Γ? Wait, let me think. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should be careful with units here. GeV and MeV can be tricky. Let me make sure all units are consistent.

So the given Γ_X is 320 MeV. Let me
