Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says: A light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame?

Wait, wait. Let me parse that. So the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light beam. Or wait, same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Oh, right, the beam is going through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So, from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving, say, to the right (assuming the light is moving to the right towards the observer).

But wait, the light is in the glass, so its speed is c/n (since in vacuum it's c, and in medium it's c/n). But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

I remember something about the Doppler effect and how velocities add, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that's for waves emitted by a moving source. Or maybe it's the relativistic velocity addition formula?

Wait, let's think about frames of reference. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is inside the glass, so in the glass's frame, the light speed is c/n. But when we switch to the lab frame, velocities don't just add linearly because of relativity.

Wait, no, wait.
