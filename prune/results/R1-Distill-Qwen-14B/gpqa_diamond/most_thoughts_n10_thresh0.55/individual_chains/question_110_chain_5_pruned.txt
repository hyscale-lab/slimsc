Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question gives me some details about each star and the capabilities of the instruments, so I need to figure out which stars are bright enough for both.

Let me first understand the setup. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait—wait, brighter than 17 mag. So that means apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17, right? Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter stars. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag ≤17. HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, which is apparent V mag ≤16. So the star needs to be bright enough for both, meaning the apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, since that's the stricter condition.

But wait, some of the stars have absolute magnitudes, and some have apparent. So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for the stars that don't have it given.

The formula to find apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where M is absolute magnitude and d is distance in parsecs. Oh wait, wait, no, the formula is m - M = 5 log10(d) -5. So m = M + 5 log10(d) -5 +5? No, wait, m = M + 5 log10(d/10). Oh right, m = M +5*(log10(d) -1). Or m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

Let me get that right.

So for each star, if I have M and d, I can compute m.

Let me list out the stars and their given parameters.

Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc.

Star2: mv=16.5, d=5pc. So this one's apparent magnitude is already given. But wait, wait no—wait, Star2's given as apparent V mag of 16.5, which is given directly. So m=16.5.

Star3: m=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, d=15pc. Wait, no
