Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, so the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Hmm, I remember that when spots are on a star, they're cooler regions, so the overall brightness and temperature go down. But wait, the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Oh right, this has to do with the Boltzmann equation in stellar atmospheres.

The problem states that the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—without spots compared to with spots.

The transition wavelength is about 1448 Å, which is in the near ultraviolet range. I think this is a line we're talking about, but I'm not entirely sure how that plays into the problem. Oh, wait, the question says that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so the Boltzmann equation applies.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in levels 2 and 1
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights
- E2 and E1 are the energy levels
- k is the Boltzmann constant
- T is the temperature

The ratio they're talking about is n1/n2, right? Because the question says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. Let me double-check. The problem states, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)... decreases when the star has spots." So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is smaller.

So without spots, the ratio is higher. The factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me write down the ratios.

When the star doesn't have spots, Teff is 6000 K. When it has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But wait, how does the presence of spots affect the temperature? The spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the average Teff of the star goes down because a significant portion of the surface is at a lower temperature. But wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the photosphere's temperature is now 5500 K on average? Or does each region (spot and non-spot) have its own temperature?

Hmm, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when
