Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a light beam moving through a glass with a certain index of refraction. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of the light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's index of refraction. Normally, when a medium is stationary, the speed of light (v) in it is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. So in this case, without any movement, the speed would be 1/n because c is given as 1.

But wait, the glass is moving. So this is a scenario involving relative motion, probably involving some sort of velocity addition. I'm a bit fuzzy on how this works with light because I know that velocities don't just add up linearly when dealing with light, especially from relativity.

Wait, right, when objects are moving relative to each other, velocities add using the Galilean transformation in non-relativistic cases, but when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. But in this problem, the speed v is given as a constant velocity, but I don't know how big it is. The options don't seem to involve any square roots or other relativistic terms, so perhaps we can treat it non-relativistically.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the Galilean transformation for velocities. So let me think about how that would apply here.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = 1/n. Since the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's movement. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at velocity u' = 1/n (assuming the direction is positive). The glass itself is moving at velocity V = v in the lab frame (since it's moving towards the observer, but wait, the beam is going towards the observer as well. Wait, the glass is moving toward the observer, same direction as the beam. So perhaps the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of reference frames. Let me denote the lab frame as S, and the glass's frame as S'. The S' frame is moving at velocity v relative to S, let's say along the positive x-direction.

In the S' frame (glass's rest frame), the light is moving at u' = v_light = 1/n.

We need to find the speed u of the light in the lab frame S.

Using the velocity addition formula from Galilean relativity, which is u = u' + v. But wait, I thought that was the case for velocities in the same direction. Let me think again. If the object's velocity in S' is u', and S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity u in S is u = u' + v. This is the Galilean transformation.

So in this case, u' is 1/n,
