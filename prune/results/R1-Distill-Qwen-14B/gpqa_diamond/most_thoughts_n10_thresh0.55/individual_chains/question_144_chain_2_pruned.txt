Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to how long the particle lives before decaying. The longer it lives, the further it travels. But wait, how do I calculate that?

I think the key here is to find the lifetime of the meson first. Once I have the lifetime, I can find the distance it travels by multiplying the lifetime by its speed. Because speed is distance over time, so time multiplied by speed would give distance.

So, the lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ. I remember that the natural linewidth formula connects the width Γ with the lifetime τ. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, right? The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, more precisely, the uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But for decay processes, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so ΔE ≈ Γ. And the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time, so Δt ≈ τ. So, Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Which means τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact relation. Let me make sure. Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that's the formula.

So, once I have τ, I need to find the velocity of the meson to calculate the distance. The distance L would be L = v * τ.

But wait, the meson is moving with some energy E. How do I find its velocity? I think I can use the relativistic energy equations. The total energy E is related to the rest mass and the momentum.

The relativistic energy is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But wait, the units here are in GeV and MeV, and c is in m/s. I'll need to be careful with the units.

Given that E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV, and Γ_X is 320 MeV. Wait, unit consistency is crucial here. Let's
