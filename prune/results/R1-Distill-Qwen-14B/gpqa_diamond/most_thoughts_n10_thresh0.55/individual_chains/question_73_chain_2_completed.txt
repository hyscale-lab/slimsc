Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. There's a specific formula for adding velocities relativistically. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait, the order matters. So if they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference divided by that denominator.

Wait, the astronauts are moving in the same direction. So one is moving at 0.6c, the other at 0.5c. Since both are in the positive x-direction, the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)].

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So that's approximately 0.14c, right? Because 0.1428 is close to 0.143, which rounds to 0.14 when considering significant figures. So looking at the options, the relative speed options are 1.1c, 0.1c, 0.14c, 0.14c again. So options C and D have 0.14c. So I can narrow down the speed part to either C or D.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own rest mass energy plus kinetic energy, but wait, in relativity, the total energy of a moving object is given by gamma * m c squared. So for each, I need to calculate their relativistic energies and add them together.

Let me compute each energy separately.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for 0.6c: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma * m c² * 2? Wait, no. Wait, the mass is 2m, so E1 = gamma * (2m) c².

So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma here: 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3 ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc². That matches option C, which has v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

Let me check if I did the calculations right. Gamma for 0.6c: 0.6c speed, so v²/c² is 0.36, 1-0.36 is 0.64, sqrt is 0.8, so 1/0.8 is 1.25. Correct. So E1 is 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 mc².

Gamma for 0.5c: v²/c² is 0.25, 1-0.25=0.75, sqrt is about 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 is approximately 1.1547. Then 3m * 1.1547 = 3.4641 m. So E2 is about 3.4641 mc².

Adding them gives 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641, which is about 5.96 mc², as I thought.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and energy is 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: when calculating the relative speed, did I do it correctly? Because in relativity, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Let me compute that again.

v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)].

The denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

Numerator: 0.1c.

So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places. So that part's correct.

So the options that match are option C and D for 0.14c. But D says E=5 mc², which is less than what I calculated. So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\). This matches the relative speed in options C and D.

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the first astronaut (\(2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the second astronaut (\(3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\).

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), and the total energy is \(E_{\text{total}} = 5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
