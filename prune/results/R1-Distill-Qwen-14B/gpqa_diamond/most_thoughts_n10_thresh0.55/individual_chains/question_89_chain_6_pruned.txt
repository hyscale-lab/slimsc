Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to think it through. Let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbon atoms in the structure.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalo) react with bases, they usually undergo elimination to form alkenes. Wait, but wait, in this case, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh, wait, 1,3-dibromo is not vicinal (adjacent), but separated by another carbon. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation but not forming an alkene directly. Hmm, wait, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, I recall that when a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH in a high-temperature condition, it can undergo a elimination reaction to form an alkene via an E2 mechanism. But if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, elimination might form a diene, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but maybe the product is a ketone.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. The NMR shows a peak at
