Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on several spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all involving C6H with varying O and H counts. The options are A) C6H12O2, B) C6H10O, C) C6H10O2, D) C6H12O.

Alright, let's break down each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of either O-H or N-H groups. Since the options don't include nitrogen, it's probably an O-H group. A broad peak is typical for such groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the question mentions two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, those are important. 

The 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak which usually indicates a carbonyl group, like in ketones, aldehydes, or esters. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl group, maybe a conjugated one or an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or an amide, but since no N is present in the options, probably something else. Wait, let me think. Or perhaps the 1650 is due to a conjugated double bond, like in an aromatic ring, or maybe an ester. Wait, another thought: the 1650 could be a C=O stretch in something like a conjugated carbonyl group, or perhaps an aromatic ring's C=C stretching? No, wait, aromatic C=C usually absorbs around 1600-1680. Alternatively, maybe an ester group has two carbonyls? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl and the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with some conjugation.

Wait, but the FTIR also shows a broad peak around 3000. If it's an O-H, that suggests perhaps an alcohol, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be
