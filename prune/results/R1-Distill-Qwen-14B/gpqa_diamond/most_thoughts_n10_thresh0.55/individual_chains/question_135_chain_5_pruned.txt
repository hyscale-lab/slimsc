Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the decay of a boson X, and the options are different possible decay channels. Let's see what I remember.

The problem states that the bosonic field X has a mass of 6 GeV. I need to find out which fermions it can decay into, considering the interaction given by the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I misread that. Oh right, probably the interaction term is something like λ times the fermion fields and X. But perhaps the specifics of the coupling aren't as important as the fact that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

So, the first thing I need to determine is which fermions have a mass that's less than or equal to half the mass of X. Because for a particle to decay into two particles, each of their masses must be less than or equal to half the mass of the parent. Since boson X is 6 GeV, half of that is 3 GeV. So each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Wait, wait. Let me think about this. The mass of the boson is 6 GeV. When it decays into two particles, say a fermion and its antiparticle, each has a rest mass. But for the decay to be kinematically allowed, the combined rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the parent's mass. But since they're a pair, each must be less than half the parent's mass. Because if each is m, then 2m has to be less than or equal to 6 GeV. So m ≤ 3 GeV.

So, what are the known fermion masses? I've got to list the fermions and their masses.

Fermions include quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), leptons (electron, muon, tau), and their antiparticles.

The masses (approximate):

- Up quark: around 2 MeV (so negligible compared to 3 GeV)
- Down quark: around 4-5 MeV
- Strange: ~100 MeV
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV
- Top: ~173 GeV (way above 3 GeV)

Leptons:

- Electron: ~0.5 MeV
- Muon: ~105 MeV
- Tau: ~1.77 GeV
- Neutrinos: negligible (but for this problem, maybe not relevant since the coupling is to ψ_f, which is a fermion, but perhaps the neutrino is too light and can be ignored?)

Wait, but the problem's Lagrangian is given as involving ψ_f, which I think is a Dirac fermion. So, each decay product is a Dirac fermion and its antiparticle.

So, any fermion pair where each fermion has mass ≤3 GeV.

So let's
