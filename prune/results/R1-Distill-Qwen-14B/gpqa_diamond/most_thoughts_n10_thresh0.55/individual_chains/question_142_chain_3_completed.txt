Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal. Let me write that out. In matrix form, |0⟩⟨0| would be [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiplying by 1/2, the ρ matrix becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. 

Density matrices are 2x2 for qubits, right? Now, I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector in 3D space with coordinates (x,y,z). For a pure state, |ψ⟩ is a vector pointing to the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are represented inside the sphere. 

Wait, but this is a density matrix. How do I find the corresponding Bloch vector for a given ρ? Oh right, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z). 

So let's write that out. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, r·σ is rx σx + ry σy + rz σz. 

Given ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let me compute I first: I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So, (I + r·σ)/2 would be (1/2) * [ [1 + rz, rx - i ry], [rx + i ry, 1 - rz] ].

Hmm, but our given ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Let me compare the two. Our given ρ has off-diagonal elements zero, so that means the (1,2) and (2,1) entries are zero. In the expression from the Bloch vector, those are rx - i ry and rx + i ry, respectively. 

So setting those equal to zero: rx - i ry = 0 and rx + i ry = 0. Let me think. If rx is a real number and ry is real too (since they're components of a vector), then the imaginary parts must cancel out. Let me write these equations:

rx - i ry = 0 → rx = i ry. But since rx and ry are real, the only solution is rx=0 and ry=0. So that's two conditions. 

Now, looking at the diagonal elements of ρ. The (1,1) element is 0.5, which is (1 + rz)/2. Similarly, (2,2) element is (1 - rz)/2. 

Wait, our given ρ has (1,1)=0.5 and (2,2)=0.5. So let's set up the equations:

(1 + rz)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + rz = 1 → rz = 0. 

Similarly, (1 - rz)/2 = 0.5 → 1 - rz = 1 → rz=0. So both equations lead to rz=0. 

So putting it all together, rx=0, ry=0, rz=0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That's the origin. 

Which of the options corresponds to that? Looking back, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C. 

Wait, but wait a second. What does this state represent? The density matrix is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is a completely mixed state. Because it's a mixture of the two basis states with equal probability. So in the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is at the origin, as that's the maximally uncertain state. That makes sense. So yeah, the position is (0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right),
\]

which in matrix form is 

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with equal probabilities for the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), indicating a completely mixed state. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a single qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this general form to the given density matrix, the off-diagonal terms of \(\rho\) are zero, which implies that the off-diagonal contributions from the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\) and \(\sigma_y\) must vanish. This leads to \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\). 

For the diagonal terms, the equations \((1 + z)/2 = 0.5\) and \((1 - z)/2 = 0.5\) yield \(z = 0\). Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This is consistent with the fact that the given density matrix represents a completely mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not a mixed state.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**: Correct, as this is the origin in the Bloch sphere, representing the completely mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Answer: C
