Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it again and try to figure out what's going on. 

So the question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When it's not covered, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Now, the problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which is stated in the problem.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(kT)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, and T is the temperature. 

The ratio N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Since the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, we can find the energy difference between the levels. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Let me compute that.

But wait, I don't need the exact energy; perhaps I can express the ratio in terms of the temperatures. Because when the star has spots, the effective temperature changes, affecting the ratio.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, 40% of the surface is covered. But the overall effective temperature (Teff) drops. So the photosphere, the unspotted areas, must be hotter than the spotted areas? Or does the presence of spots lower the overall Teff. Hmm, but the question is about the photospheric effective temperature when the spots are present. So the entire photosphere is at a lower Teff when spots are present.

Wait, no. Wait, the effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity. If 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler, then the overall effective temperature is a weighted average
