Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix and its geometrical position in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. Or maybe it's a completely mixed state for a single qubit? Because |0><0| is a projector onto state |0>, and same with |1><1|. So adding them and dividing by 2 would make it a mixed state where each state has 50% probability.

Now, the question is where this density matrix is located geometrically in the qubit space. I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, a single qubit state can be represented as a vector in a 3D space. For pure states, it's on the surface of the sphere, like |0> is at (1,0,0) and |1> is at (-1,0,0), or maybe that's the other way around. Wait, no, wait. The Bloch sphere uses the vector (x,y,z) where |ψ> = cos(θ/2)|0> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1>. So for |0>, θ is 0, φ is anything, but the point is (1,0,0). For |1>, θ is π, so it's at (-1,0,0). But wait, that might not be exactly right because some sources have |1> as (0,0,1) in the Bloch sphere. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should think about the general form. The density matrix for a single qubit can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can express the given ρ in that form, then r would be the coordinates on the Bloch sphere.

Given ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute that. |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

Now, the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ is I/2, that would mean r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 is I/2. So r must be the zero vector. Because any non-zero r would contribute something to the matrix.

Wait, what does r·σ look like? The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ = r_x σx + r
