Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. The options are different chemical formulas, and I need to pick the correct one based on the data provided.

First, let's go through the information given. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR typically suggest O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. The other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, those might indicate carbonyl groups. The peak at 1700 is probably a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an ester. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ketone or an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, or maybe an ester. Or wait, another possibility is that the 1650 is an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like C=C stretching.

The 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has an alkene group. Also, the presence of vinyl protons suggests that the structure has a double bond somewhere, maybe as part of a ring or as a substituent.

The mass spectrum has a fragment at m/z 45. I remember that m/z 45 is a common fragment, possibly from a ketone group. Wait, 45 is the mass of CH3CO+ (since 12+16+12+16 = 45? Wait, no. Let me think: the fragment could be a CH2O group, but maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, 45 could be from a (CH3)2CO+ fragment—since (CH3)2CO would be 58? Hmm. Wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, 45 is the mass of a (CH2)2O group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the mass of a fragment from a smaller part of the molecule. Wait, another thought: 45 could be the mass of a CH2CH2O group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's the mass of a fragment that includes a carbonyl group. For example, if you have a ketone, a (CH3)2CO+ ion would be 58? Wait, wait, let me calculate. Carbon is 12, hydrogen is 1, oxygen is 16. So (CH3)2CO would be (2*(12+3*1)) +12 +16 +16? Wait no, let's recalculate. (CH3)2CO is (2* (12+3) ) + 12 + 16. So 2*(15) =30, plus 12 is 42, plus 16 is 58. Oh, right, so that's 58. So if the fragment is 45, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, 45 could be from a CH2CH2O group, but that's 46. Hmm. Maybe it's something like a methyl est
