Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy, I think. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. 

So, the setup is that 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm trying to find the minimum energy of the system. Oh wait, wait. Minimum energy usually relates to the potential energy, because the system would arrange itself to have the lowest possible potential energy, right? Or maybe the minimum potential energy configuration.

Wait, but how are the charges arranged? So the 12 charges are all 2 meters away from point P, which has the 13th charge. So point P is where one charge is fixed. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P.

I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their positions. But wait, since the system is isolated, maybe we need to consider the potential energy contributions between each pair of charges.

Wait, but in this case, the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P. So their mutual potential energy might contribute to the total. Also, each of these 12 charges has a charge of
