Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible interactions that could be added to the Standard Model, respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options given are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz Symmetry. I believe that SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz invariance because they're part of a relativistic quantum field theory. Without Lorentz symmetry, the theory wouldn't make sense in different inertial frames. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translations. Wait, but in effective theories, sometimes you have operators that break translation symmetry, like those with higher derivatives or higher dimensions. Oh wait, no, SMEFT operators are constructed to be local and Lorentz-invariant. So they should respect Poincare symmetry as well because that includes translations. Or does it? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. So if the operators are local and Lorentz-invariant, they must be Poincare-invariant too. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Wait, but wait. I remember that in SMEFT, operators are typically written in a way that's Lorentz symmetric because they include terms like the SM fields and higher-dimensional terms built from SM fields. But do they have to respect Poincare? Because Poincare symmetry includes not just Lorentz but also translation. So operators in SMEFT are local, so they must respect translation symmetry. That means Poincare must be respected. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

Next, what about CP symmetry? I think that depends. SMEFT doesn't necessarily require all operators to respect CP symmetry. Because operators that violate CP could exist, provided that the effective theory as a whole respects some other symmetry or that the parameters are such that CP is conserved. But wait, no. The question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So for each operator, regardless of their type, they must individually respect certain symmetries.

Wait, but I think that in SMEFT, the operators are constructed to be invariant under the SM gauge group and Lorentz symmetry. But for CP? Some operators can violate CP. Like, for example, the Weinberg operator is CP-even, but
