Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and figure out what's going on step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what each product looks like.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (compounds with two halides on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework. When KOH is used, it's a dehydrohalogenation, so two HBr molecules are eliminated, forming a double bond. The product would be 1,3-diene adamantane or maybe an annulene? Wait, no. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the elimination would form a bridge structure with a double bond.

But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form a diene. But the product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The NMR data is given: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is around the carbonyl region. Wait, if that's the case, maybe the product isn't just an alkene. Because IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group—like a ketone or ester. Hmm, but elimination usually gives alkenes. So perhaps another reaction is happening here.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and under strong basic conditions, it's not just elimination but maybe dehydrohalogenation followed by something else. Or maybe it's a substitution reaction? But with KOH, I thought elimination is more likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's more about amines.

Wait, another possibility: The initial product is a ketone. How? Maybe the two bromides are in a position that when they eliminate, they form a carbonyl group. Oh wait, wait
