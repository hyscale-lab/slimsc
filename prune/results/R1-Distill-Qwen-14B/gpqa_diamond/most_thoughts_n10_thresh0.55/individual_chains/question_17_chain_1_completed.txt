Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions. 

The problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The pH is ideal, which probably means that all the EDTA is in the form that can complex with calcium, so I don't need to worry about protonation states. The temperature is 25°C, but I'm not sure if that affects anything here. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. I think K here is the formation constant, which tells us how strong the complex is.

So, the Ca-EDTA complex dissociates into calcium ions and EDTA ions. Let me write the dissociation reaction. The complex is probably CaY^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. So the dissociation would be:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-

The formation constant Kf is [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) = 5e10. But wait, in solution, once the complex dissociates, the concentration of Ca^2+ and Y^4- would be equal, right? Because for each mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of each ion is produced. So [Ca^2+] = [Y^4-] = x.

The concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M CaY^2-. When it dissociates, some of it breaks into Ca^2+ and Y^4-. Let me set up an ICE table.

Initial:
[CaY^2-] = 0.02 M
[Ca^2+] = 0
[Y^4-] = 0

Change:
[CaY^2-] decreases by x → 0.02 - x
[Ca^2+] increases by x → x
[Y^4-] increases by x → x

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So the expression becomes:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 5e10

So 0.02 / x² = 5e10. Rearranging, x² = 0.02 / (5e10). Let me compute that.

0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12, which is 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13 → x is sqrt(4e-13) which is 2e-6.5. Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. Wait, 1e-13's square root is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7. Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake there. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 4e-13 is x squared, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Which is the same as 2 * 1e-6.5. 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2*3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. So the concentration of Ca^2+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Let me look at the options.

Option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but why did I approximate x as much smaller than 0.02? Let's check if that's a valid assumption. If x is about 6.3e-7, then 0.02 - 6.3e-7 is approximately 0.01999937, which is very close to 0.02. So the approximation holds. Therefore, the answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) ions that dissociate from the complex. The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \quad \text{(since \( x \) is small compared to 0.02)},
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x.
\]

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}.
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).**
