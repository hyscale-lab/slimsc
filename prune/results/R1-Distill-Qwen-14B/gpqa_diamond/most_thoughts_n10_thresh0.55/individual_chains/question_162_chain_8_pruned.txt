Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think this through step by step.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that the area of a surface in such a metric can be found by integrating the area element over the surface. The area element in two dimensions is usually sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. 

Wait, right, the metric here is diagonal, so the determinant should be straightforward. Let me write the metric tensor components. The line element is in terms of dx² and dy², so the (1,1) component is 32/(4 - x² - y²) and the (2,2) component is the same. The off-diagonal terms (like dx dy) are zero, so the metric is diag(a, a), where a is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

The determinant g is the product of the diagonal terms because it's diagonal, so g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, actually, for a 2x2 diagonal matrix, the determinant is just the product of the diagonal elements. So yes, g = (32/(4 - r²))², since x² + y² = r² in polar coordinates.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Alternatively,
