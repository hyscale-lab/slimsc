Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there's a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Hmm, interesting. I remember that when stars have spots, they can affect the observed temperature because spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, right?

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. So, when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio of level 1 to level 2 is some value, and when it does have spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. The options are A to D.

Wait, so the ratio decreases when the star has spots. What does that mean? I think it's about the Boltzmann equation because we're dealing with energy levels in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which the problem states.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant. The ratio n1/n2 would then be the inverse, which is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ).

Wait, but in this case, the ratio of n1/n2 is observed to decrease when spots are present. Let me think: when the temperature decreases, what happens to the ratio? Because the problem says when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K), and the ratio n1/n2 (which is level 1 to level 2) decreases.

Wait, so without spots, T is higher (6000 K), and with spots, T is lower (5500 K). And the ratio n1/n2 is lower in the lower T case.

So, let's model this. Let
