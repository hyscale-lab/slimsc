Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. Let's take it step by step.

Alright, the question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually used for the hydrolysis of a nitrile group. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when a nitrile is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it gets converted into a carboxylic acid. So if Compound X has a nitrile group, then the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, I see options A and C are carboxylic acids. So that's a clue. Let's look at the IR and NMR data of Compound X to figure out its structure.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which I think is a broad peak, maybe from an -OH group or maybe an -NH stretch, but more likely an -OH since the other options don't have amine groups. Wait, but wait, another common peak in that region is an alkyne C-H stretch, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents causing some hydrogen bonds or something. But more importantly, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a nitrile or amide. But in this case, since the reagents are red phosphorus and HI, which I think is for nitrile hydrolysis, so maybe the 1720 cm-1 is from a nitrile's C≡N group. Wait, but nitriles don't have a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe it's a ketone. Or an ester. Alternatively, maybe the 1720 is a carbonyl from an ester.

Wait, nitriles have a strong triple bond which has absorption around 2200-2260 cm-1. Oh, but the IR here doesn't show that. So maybe the 1720 is from a carbonyl group like a ketone or ester. Hmm.

Looking for other IR peaks: 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range for aromatic C=C stretches. The 1610 is maybe the more substituted (like para) C=C, and 1450 could be another aromatic ring mode or perhaps some conjugated double bond elsewhere, but in this case, it's likely aromatic.

Now the NMR. Let's go through the peaks:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an -OH proton, maybe from a phenol group. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But in this case, it's broad, so more likely an -OH, like a phenol.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet in the aromatic region. If it's a para-substituted benzene, this could be two protons each as doublets. Like in para-substituted benzene rings, each H is a doublet if the substituent is ortho/para directing.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, probably the other two Hs in the aromatic ring. So maybe in a para-substituted benzene ring, with two substituents. Wait, but in para substitution, each H would be a doublet, so maybe the 8.0 and 7.2 are the two sets of Hs. So that suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents or maybe a single substituent in para position.

Wait, but each substituent in the para position would cause that. So perhaps the benzene ring has a substituent at para position. But wait, maybe there's another substituent as well. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in the meta position, but that would give more complex splitting.

Wait, but wait, the two doublets each integrate to 2
