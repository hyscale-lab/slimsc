Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me see. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as c times S. The constant c is h over 4π, right?

Wait, the matrix S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are similar. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So S might be one of them. Let me check:

Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So yeah, S is sigma_y, which is the Pauli Y matrix. So Ay = c * sigma_y, with c = h/(4π).

So the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Since sigma_y is a Pauli matrix, its eigenvalues are ±1. So when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(±1). Let's compute that.

c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues a are (h/(4π)) * 1 = h/(4π) and (h/(4π))*-1 = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, let's see what each says.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, that doesn't make sense because eigenvalues are real or complex? Well, for angular momentum operators, I think the eigenvalues should be real. Because spin is an observable quantity, so the eigenvalues should be real numbers. So if the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), which are real, but option A is presenting them as having imaginary parts. So that can't be right. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that doesn't fit either because the eigenvalues I found are real. So B's eigenvalues are complex, which doesn't make sense. So B is likely incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A squared, but not of Az. So, A squared is the square of the operator. A is the angular momentum operator, so A² would have eigenvalues a², where a is the eigenvalue of A. Since we're dealing with spin-½ particles (muon is a lepton, so spin ½), the square of the angular momentum is ħ² (since for spin, S² = s(s+1)ħ², here s=½, so 3/4 ħ². Wait, but in this problem, Ay is c * S, so A is c multiplied by S. Wait, maybe I should clarify. Wait, the operator in question is Ay, which is c times S. But the overall spin operator is S, which for a muon (spin ½) would have S² = (½)(½+1)ħ² = (3/4) ħ². So when you square the total angular momentum operator, but here we're looking at the component Ay.

Wait, but the square of the operator A would be (c S_y)^2, which is c² S_y². But S_y is a component of the spin, so S_x² + S_y² + S_z² = S(S+1) ħ². But for spin ½, that's (3/4) ħ². So the eigenvalues of A² would be (c S_y)^2, but wait, in general, for any spin state, the square of a component (like S_y²) isn't diagonal in the eigenbasis of S_y. So maybe the eigenfunctions of S_y are not the same as those of A²
