Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface in Lorentzian geometry, which means it has a constant negative curvature. I remember that in Riemannian geometry, a sphere has positive curvature and finite area, while a pseudosphere, or hyperbolic space, has infinite area. But wait, this isn't exactly about the space itself, it's about the area of a specific pseudosphere.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, wait, pseudospheres in 2D are often represented as surfaces of revolution, like the tractricoid. But perhaps in this context, it's considering the metric given.

Wait, the metric here is in two dimensions, right? Because it's written in terms of dx² and dy². So it's a 2D manifold. The metric coefficient is a function of x² + y². So the metric is conformally flat, which means it can be written as e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²), but here the coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

Wait, but how does this relate to the area? The area in a metric is calculated using the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor for this is diag[ A, A ], where A is 32/(
