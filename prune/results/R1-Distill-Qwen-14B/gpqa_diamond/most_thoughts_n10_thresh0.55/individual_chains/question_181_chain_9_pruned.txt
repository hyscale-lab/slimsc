Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about neutrinos and the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino production, but let me think this through step by step.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, right, because that's the time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if something happened in the core, like stopping a reaction, we'd see the effect here on Earth after that time delay.

So the pp-III branch is one of the proton-proton chains in the Sun's core. I remember that the pp-I chain is the main one, right? And then there are other branches like pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, pp-III is a branch where a helium-3 nucleus captures two protons to make a boron-5 nucleus, which then decays into a beryllium-5 and emits a positron and a neutrino. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me think. Oh yeah, the pp-I chain is the dominant one, producing helium-4, while pp-II and pp-III are other pathways but contribute less. But I'm not super sure about the details.

The question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). They want the ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2 after the pp-III branch stops.

Wait, what do I know about the neutrino energies from different reactions? So, the main source of solar neutrinos is the pp chain, which produces electron neutrinos. The typical energies are around a few hundred keV. The higher the energy, the more energetic the neutrinos.

In the pp-I process, the main line is at around 572 keV. Then, the pp-II branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, and pp-III even higher, I think. Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: the pp-III branch involves the reaction 2He-3 + 2p → B-5, which then decays into Be-5 + e+ + νe. The Q value of this reaction would determine the neutrino energy. The Q for the pp-III branch is higher than the main pp-I, so the neutrinos emitted would have higher energies. So the pp-III branch would produce neutrinos in higher energy bands.

So if the pp-III branch stops, then the production of high-energy neutrinos would decrease. But the question is about the ratio between two bands after the stoppage.

Assuming that before the stoppage, neutrinos from pp-III contributed to both bands, but especially the higher energy one. So if pp-III stops, the flux in the higher band (band 2, 800-900 keV) would decrease more than in band 1 (700-800 keV), because band 2 is higher energy. But wait, I'm not sure if the pp-III neutrinos fall into both bands or just the higher one.

Alternatively, perhaps the main contribution to band 2 comes from pp-III. So if pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would drop significantly,
