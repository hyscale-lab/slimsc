Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down. The question is about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember involves enolates attacking a carbonyl compound. 

The problem has three parts (A, B, C), each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to determine the products for each and match them with the given options.

Starting with part A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. I think NaOEt is a base, maybe it deprotonates something to form an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a diethyl acyl malonate ester. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. So, in the presence of a base like NaOEt, it probably forms an enolate at the central carbon. The enolate would then attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the double bond. Wait, no, wait: the structure of that acrylate is CH2CH2? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the (E) configuration. Hmm, actually, wait, the correct structure for methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think: acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, the 3-positionâ€”maybe the structure is more like CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me correct that. The structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, no, wait, the 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Hmm, maybe I should think of the acrylate as the group with the double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. So for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached at the double bond. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Because 3-position would be the double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2.

Wait, let me clarify. The general structure of an acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So if it's
