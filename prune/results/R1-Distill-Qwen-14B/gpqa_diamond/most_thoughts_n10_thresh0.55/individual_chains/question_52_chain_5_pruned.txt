Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down and figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changing when a star has spots. I remember that this has to do with the Saha equation because it deals with ionization states in stellar atmospheres. 

So the star's parameters are given. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but does the spot coverage affect the average Teff? I think when spots are present, the total luminosity changes because spots are cooler. But the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered. Oh, right, so the effective temperature here is an average considering the spots.

The Saha equation relates the ionization states of atoms in a star's atmosphere. But wait, this question is about the ratio of two neutral levels, so maybe it's the Boltzmann equation we need? Because the Saha equation is more about ionization (like neutral to ionized), while the Boltzmann equation deals with excitation within the same ionization state. 

Right, the Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. 

The problem says that when the star has spots, the Teff drops to 5500 K. So the ratio (n1/n2) before and after will change based on the temperature. Wait, the observed ratio decreases when there are spots. So the ratio n1/n2 is lower when T is lower. Or wait, let me think. The ratio of level 1 to level 2, n1/n2, is what's being measured. 

The transition wavelength is about 1448 Ã…, which is in the near ultraviolet. But I'm not sure how that plays into this. Maybe it's just to tell us the energy difference between the levels? Because wavelength relates to energy via E = hc
