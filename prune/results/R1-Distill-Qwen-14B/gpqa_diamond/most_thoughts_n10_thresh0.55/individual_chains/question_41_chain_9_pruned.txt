Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. Wait, so the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Interesting.

I remember that when you have a medium moving relative to an observer, you have to consider the effects of motion on the speed of light within that medium. But wait, the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So in the rest frame of the glass, the light would be moving at v_light = c/n.

But since the glass itself is moving, we need to find out what this speed is according to the lab frame. So the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. Wait, but the light is also moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving at v, and the light is moving at some speed in the glass's frame.

I think this is a problem involving the addition of velocities, like in special relativity. Oh wait, but when the medium is moving, how does that affect the speed of light measured in the lab frame? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. So, from the lab frame, the glass is moving, so the light's speed isn't just v_light plus v, because in rel
