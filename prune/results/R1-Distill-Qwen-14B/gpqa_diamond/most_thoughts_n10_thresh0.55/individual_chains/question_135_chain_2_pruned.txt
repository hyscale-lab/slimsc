Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Oh right, I think ψ_f is a fermion field. So the interaction term involves the boson X coupling to fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I remember that when a particle decays, the mass of the particle has to be at least equal to the sum of the masses of the decay products. Because energy and mass are related via E=mc², right? So the decay products' rest masses must be less than or equal to X's mass.

Wait, but I should think about what particles can X decay into. Since X is a boson, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, like a Z boson does. So the decay would be X → f f-bar. The possible fermions depend on their masses.

So what fermions have masses less than or equal to 6 GeV? Let's list the known fermions and their approximate masses.

Quarks: up (u), down (d) are light, around a few MeV each. Strange (s) is about 100 MeV, but wait, that's not right. Wait, no, the masses are different. Let me think. Up and down are about 2-5
