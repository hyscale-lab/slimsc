Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, right. Let's start by breaking down the given data.

First, looking at the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-¹, 1720 cm-¹, 1610 cm-¹, and 1450 cm-¹. Let me think about what each of these might indicate. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 cm-¹ usually suggests O-H or N-H stretches. Since it's a broad peak, maybe it's an O-H from a carbonyl group, like a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, but wait, the 1720 cm-¹ is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that would fit with a carboxylic acid because they have O-H and C=O. Alternatively, it could be an ester or ketone, but the O-H in carboxylic acids is broad and strong. So maybe this compound is a carboxylic acid.

Now, the 1610 and 1450 cm-¹ peaks. These are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound likely has an aromatic ring, like a benzene or substituted benzene.

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows several signals:

- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but in this case, it's a broad signal, which makes me think it's an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the -OH protons are usually around 10-12 ppm and appear as broad singlets. So that supports the earlier thought that it's a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm, doublet, 2H. These are aromatic protons, probably in a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and split each other into doublets. Wait,
