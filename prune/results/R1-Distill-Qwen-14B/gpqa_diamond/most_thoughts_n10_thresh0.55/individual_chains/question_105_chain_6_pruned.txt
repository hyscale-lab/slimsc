Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the problem is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness variations observed will look like those caused by an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is asking, what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness change as the spotted star.

The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of that dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The formula I recall is that the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

Wait, but in this case, the star has spots. So when the spots rotate into and out of view, the star's brightness changes. Since the spots are darker, when they're facing us, the total brightness is less than when they're not. But the problem states that the brightness variations due to the spots are similar to those caused by a planet. So the goal is to find what planet radius would produce the same ΔF as the spots.

So I need to calculate the fractional change caused by the spots and set that equal to (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Let me think about this.

The star's total surface area is 4π Rstar². Since it's one hemisphere, the area of the hemisphere is 2π Rstar². The spots cover 20% of this hemisphere, so the spotted area is 0.20 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4π Rstar².

But wait, the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, at any given time, the spots may be facing us or not. But the problem says the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view as it spins. The brightness variation would be periodic as the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, but the problem says that the brightness variation due to the spots is the same as if a planet were transiting. So we can model this as the equivalent of a planet blocking a certain fraction of the star's light.

But wait, the brightness change due to the spots depends on the temperature difference. Because the spots are cooler, so when they are facing us, the total emitted light is less than when they're not.

So the total flux from the star is the sum of flux from the spotted and unspotted regions. When the star isn't rotating, the spots would be on the side facing us, but as it rotates, spots come into view.

Wait, but the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into and go out of view, right? So the brightness
