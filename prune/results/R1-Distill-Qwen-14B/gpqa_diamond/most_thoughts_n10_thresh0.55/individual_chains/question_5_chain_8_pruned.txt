Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about finding the eigenvector of a operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this often relate to angular momentum or spin.

Wait, the problem gives me the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So each component is a Pauli matrix scaled by ħ/2. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So P must be the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle, like an electron or muon.

The operator P is given along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is arbitrary but lies in x-z. That means the direction can be parametrized by an angle θ from the z-axis, I think. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait no, since it's in x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, perhaps. Wait, maybe more simply: any direction in x-z plane can be described by polar angles where the y-component is zero. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if θ is the angle from the z-axis. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the parametrization. Alternatively, perhaps n is (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but that depends on the convention. Hmm, I'll have to think about how the spin operator is constructed.

The general spin operator along an arbitrary direction n is given by P = (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz). Because spin operators are proportional to the Pauli matrices. So in this case, since n is in the x-z plane, n_y would be zero. So P would be (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz).

But wait, the problem says the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane. So n is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ)? No, wait. Since it's in x-z, maybe φ is 0, making n have only x and z components. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps. Or maybe it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ). Wait, usually in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So if the point is in x-z, the y-coordinate is zero, so the direction is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) where φ is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. But for x-z plane, φ is 0 or π. So perhaps the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ is the angle from the positive z-axis.

But wait, the problem says that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so perhaps the direction is (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² =1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the direction is given as an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, which means that the operator P is along this direction. The eigenvector we're looking
