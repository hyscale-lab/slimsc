Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through.

Parallax is a measure of distance to stars. I remember that the parallax (p) is inversely proportional to the distance. So, p = 1/d, where d is the distance. That means as the parallax increases, the distance decreases. So stars with higher parallax are closer to us.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, the number density in terms of parallax. Wait, how does the number of stars depend on parallax in a uniform distribution?

If stars are uniformly distributed, their spatial density (number per unit volume) is constant. Let's denote this as n. But how does this translate into the number of stars per unit parallax interval?

I think I should relate the volume of space that a certain parallax range corresponds to. Because for a given parallax, you can imagine a sphere of stars at that distance. So, the number of stars in a thin shell (parallax p to p+dp) would relate to the volume of that shell.

The volume of a spherical shell at radius d with thickness dr is approximately 4πd² dr. Since p = 1/d, then dr = -dp/(p²). So, replacing d with 1/p, the volume becomes 4π (1/p²)² * (dp/(p²)) )? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Let me go step by step. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So the volume of a thin shell between r and r+dr is approximately 4πr² dr. Since r is 1/p, then the shell volume would be 4π (1/p)^2 * (dr). But since dr = (1/p') - (1/p), and for small dr, dr ≈ - dp/(p²). Wait, because if p increases, r decreases. So as p increases, r is 1/p. So, dr = - (1/p²) dp.

So substituting, the volume of the shell is 4π (1/p)^2 * (- dp/(p²)) )? Wait no, maybe I should think in terms of p.

Wait, let's express the volume in terms of p. The shell is at distance d = 1/p, and thickness dr. So, volume is 4π d² dr. But dr = (d_next - d_prev) = (1/(p_next) - 1/(p_prev)). For a small change, dr ≈ - (1/p²) dp. Because p = 1/d, so dp = - (1/d²) dd. Or, dr = - (1/p²) dp.

So, the volume becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - (1/p²) dp ). Wait, but that would be negative, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I should take absolute values for the volume.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the number of stars as a function of parallax.

Since the number density n is constant, the number of stars in a shell is n multiplied by the volume of the shell.

So, N = n * 4π d² dr.

But since dr = (1/p_next - 1/p_prev) and for small intervals, dr ≈ - (1/p²) dp. Because p = 1/d, so dp = - (1/d²) dd. So, dr = - dp/(p²).

So substituting d = 1/p, dr = - dp/(p²).

So, N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - dp/(p²) ) ) = n * 4π * (1/p²) * ( - dp/p² ) = n *4π (- dp)/p^4.

Wait, but since we're considering the number of stars per unit parallax, perhaps we're looking for dN/dp, the number per unit p.

Wait, N is the number of stars in a thin shell with parallax p to p+dp. So dN = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - dp/(p²) )

So dN/dp = n * 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p²) ) = -4π n / p^4.

Since number can't be negative, I take absolute value, so dN/dp = 4π n / p^4.

Wait, but the question is about how the number per unit parallax changes with parallax. So, if p increases, how does dN/dp change?

From the expression, dN/dp is proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, that would mean as p increases, the number per unit parallax decreases with 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax interval decreases as 1/p^4. So the number is proportional to 1/p^4, which would correspond to option A.

But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Another approach: the number of stars between parallax p and p + dp would be the volume between those two spheres multiplied by the number density.

The volume between p and p+dp is the volume of the sphere at distance 1/p+dp minus the volume at 1/p. But wait, that's not correct. Wait, no, wait. Wait, p is 1/d, so as p increases, d decreases. So higher p corresponds to closer distances.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the volume per unit parallax.

Wait, the number of stars per unit volume is uniform, so N = n * V, where V is the volume. The volume between two spheres of radius 1/(p + dp) and 1/p is (4/3)π [ (1/p)^3 - (1/(p+dp))^3 ].

But for very small dp, this can be approximated. Let me expand (1/(p+dp))^3. Let me write (p+dp) as p(1 + dp/p), so 1/(p+dp) = 1/(p (1 + dp/p)) ) ≈ (1/p) (1 - dp/p) [using 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x for small x].

So, (1/(p+dp))^3 ≈ (1/p^3) (1 - 3 dp/p ), using the binomial approximation (1 - x)^3 ≈ 1 -3x.

So, the volume V is (4/3)π [ (1/p)^3 - (1/(p+dp))^3 ] ≈ (4/3)π [ (1/p^3) - (1/p^3)(1 -3 dp/p) ) ] = (4/3) π [ (1/p^3) * ( 3 dp/p ) ) ].

Wait, that's (4/3 π) [ (1/p^3) (3 dp/p) ) ] = 4 π dp/(p^4).

So, the volume V ≈ 4 π dp / p^4.

Then, the number of stars in this volume is N = n * V = n * (4 π dp / p^4).

So, dN/dp = 4 π n / p^4.

Which shows that the number per unit parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the number of stars per unit parallax interval decreases as 1/p^4. Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me think again about the options. The question says, "how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?" So it's about dN/dp as a function of p.

So dN/dp = constant * (1/p^4). So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number decreases as 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax and distance, as well as the spatial distribution of stars.

1. **Parallax and Distance Relationship**: Parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). This means that as \( p \) increases, the distance \( d \) decreases.

2. **Volume of a Spherical Shell**: The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). For a small change in parallax \( dp \), the corresponding change in distance is \( dr = -dp / p^2 \) (since \( p = 1/d \)).

3. **Number of Stars in a Parallax Interval**: The number of stars in a thin shell with parallax \( p \) to \( p + dp \) is given by:
   \[
   dN = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dr,
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number density of stars (constant for a uniform distribution). Substituting \( d = 1/p \) and \( dr = -dp / p^2 \), the expression becomes:
   \[
   dN = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \left(\frac{-dp}{p^2}\right) = -\frac{4\pi n}{p^4} dp.
   \]

4. **Number Per Unit Parallax**: The number of stars per unit parallax interval is \( dN/dp \), which simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{dN}{dp} = \frac{4\pi n}{p^4}.
   \]
   This shows that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \).

5. **Analysis of Options**: Among the given options:
   - **A) \( \sim 1/p^4 \)**: Matches the derived result.
   - **B) \( \sim 1/p^2 \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p^2 \).
   - **C) \( \sim 1/p^1 \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p \).
   - **D) \( \sim 1/p^3 \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is \( 1/p^4 \), not \( 1/p^3 \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \), making the correct answer:

**Answer: A**
