Okay, so I've got this problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds mean I can't just use classical mechanics; I definitely need to use special relativity here.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so they're moving in the same direction. That probably affects the relative velocity calculation.

First, I need to find the relative speed between them. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula for relative velocity isn't as simple as subtracting the two speeds. I remember the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference in their speeds divided by that factor.

Wait, let me get that straight. If the first astronaut is moving at u = 0.6c and the second at v = 0.5c, then the relative speed of the second from the first's frame would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait no, wait. Because if the second is moving slower, then from the first's perspective, the second would be approaching at what speed?

Wait, no, wait—actually, when calculating relative velocities, if you're in the first astronaut's frame (moving at 0.6c), the second astronaut's speed would be (0.
