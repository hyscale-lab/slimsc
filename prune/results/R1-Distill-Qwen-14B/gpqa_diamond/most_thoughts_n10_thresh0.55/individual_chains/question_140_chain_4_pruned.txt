Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the problem.

The question involves a substance X reacting with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Plus, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm. Let me start by tackling each part one by one.

First, the reaction: X reacts violently with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Wait, what's 277 K in Celsius? Oh, right, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius (since 273 K is 0°C, so 277-273=4). So B has a melting point near 4°C. What substance has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ice, but that's 0°C. Or maybe another solid. Wait, maybe B is a solid at 0°C but starts to melt around 4. Hmm. Alternatively, could B be a different compound?

Wait, another approach: I remember that solid ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) has a melting point around 337 K (64°C), but that's higher. Maybe B is a different compound. Alternatively, maybe B is sodium chloride? No, NaCl's melting point is higher, around 800°C. Hmm.

Wait, the gas W has a molecule with same number of neutrons and protons. So W is a molecule where the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons. Let's think about common gases. For example, CO2 is a gas, but the molecule is CO2. Wait, no, CO2 has a linear structure. Wait, what's the composition of W's molecule?

Wait, maybe W is a diatomic molecule. Let's think: for diatomic, like O2, N2, H2, etc. The number of protons and neutrons in the molecule must be equal. Wait, but the molecule as a whole? So the sum of all protons and sum of all neutrons must be the same? Or per atom? Hmm, the question says "molecule contains the same number
