Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So I think the operator P itself is the vector sum of these components, meaning P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. But since the direction is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, the operator we're interested in is P·n. 

Wait, more accurately, the operator whose eigenvector we're looking for is P·n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. So n would have components (nx, 0, nz), with nx² + nz² = 1. Because it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

But wait, the components P_x, P_y, and P_z are each 2x2 matrices. So the operator P·n would be (P_x nx + P_z nz) multiplied by ħ/2?
