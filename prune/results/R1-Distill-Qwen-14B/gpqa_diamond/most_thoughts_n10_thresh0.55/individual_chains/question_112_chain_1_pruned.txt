Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have an electron described by the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Here, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij = ħ/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Then, I also have to find the average value of that operator. The options are A to D, each giving probabilities and an average value.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I think I need to normalize the given state |alpha> because the problem says it's "proportional" to that expression. Then, perhaps find the eigenstates of the operator corresponding to Aij. Once I have those, I can compute the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate when I measure the operator. Also, the average value would be the expectation value of the operator.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the operator first. The matrix Aij is given with Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So, for a 2x2 system (since it's in terms of |up> and |down>), the matrix would look like:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0  ]

Right? Because for i≠j, the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2, and the diagonal elements are zero. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables. So what does this operator represent? It looks like a spin component, perhaps. Because the Pauli matrices have similar structures. Oh, wait a second—this matrix looks like (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1], [1,0]], so multiplying by ħ/2 gives exactly the Aij elements.

So the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. That might make things easier because I know the eigenstates of σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the operator represented by the matrix [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. Let me find those eigenstates. Alternatively, since I know the eigenstates of σ_x, I can use them here.

The Pauli X matrix's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates for the x-component of spin. These are the states that are superpositions of |up> and |down>, specifically:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2

Wait, or is that correct? Let me double-check. The eigenstates of σ_x are actually in the form (|up> + |down>)/√
