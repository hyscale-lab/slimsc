Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition corresponds to 1448 Ã…, and we're assuming LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium) in the photosphere.

Hmm. So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels based on temperature and their energy difference.

The formula I recall is the ratio of populations N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels, E is the energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. So, when there are spots, the photosphere's temperature is lower. That would affect the populations of the energy levels.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio of N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots (Teff=5500 K), the ratio is lower than when it doesn't (6000 K).

Wait, let me think again. The ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). So if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller if E2 > E1. Because, for example, if E2 is higher than E1, then higher T would make the ratio bigger because the
