Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is a relativistic version, which means we have to consider the effects of special relativity, right?

The question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass. In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at max speed is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so that approach might not hold.

In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy (rest energy plus kinetic) would be gamma mc². But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is conserved, so when the speed is maximum, the potential energy is zero and all the energy is kinetic.

Wait, no, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². At maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total mechanical energy E is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the energy can't be simply split into kinetic
