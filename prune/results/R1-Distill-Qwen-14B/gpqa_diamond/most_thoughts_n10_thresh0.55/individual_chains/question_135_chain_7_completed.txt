Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about particle decays. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

First, I remember that the decay products must have a combined mass less than the mass of the boson. That's because of conservation of energy—each product has to have enough energy to create their rest masses.

The Lagrangian is given as:
L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, actually, looking again, it's:
-λ f ψ_f bar (ῡ + X) ψ_f.

Hmm, maybe I should parse this correctly. So the interaction term is something like λ times f times ψ_f bar times (ῡ + X) times ψ_f. So the interaction is between the field X and the fermion ψ_f. So this suggests that X can decay into a pair of fermions ψ and ψ bar.

So the decay process would be X → ψ ψ̄. But what are the possible fermions ψ here? The Lagrangian seems to involve ψ_f, which might be a specific type of fermion. Let me think about the possible fermions.

Wait, the options given have various fermion-antifermion pairs. So for example, option A includes b, s, u, d, tau, and electron pairs. Option B has c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, etc.

The mass of the X boson is 6 GeV. So any decay products must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV.

Let me list all possible fermion pairs. Each pair has a rest mass, and the sum must be less than 6 GeV.

So, what are the masses of the fermions?

I think quarks have the following masses (approximate):

Up quark (u): around 2 MeV
Down quark (d): around 4-5 MeV
Strange quark (s): about 100 MeV
Charm quark (c): about 1.2-1.5 GeV
Bottom quark (b): about 4.5-5 GeV
Top quark (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV, but since X is only 6 GeV, t is out of the question.

For leptons:

Electron (e): about 0.5 MeV
Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
Neutrinos are almost massless, but since the problem doesn't mention them, probably they're not considered here.

So for X → ψ ψ̄, the total mass must be less than 6 GeV.

Looking at each fermion:

1. u and ū: each u is ~2 MeV. So total 4 MeV, way under 6 GeV. So this is allowed.

2. d and d̄: same, about 8 MeV. Allowed.

3. s and s̄: each s is ~100 MeV, so total 200 MeV. Allowed.

4. c and c̄: each c is ~1.5 GeV, so 3 GeV total. X is 6 GeV, so 3 GeV <6 GeV. Allowed.

5. b and b̄: each b is ~4.5 GeV, so 9 GeV total. 9 GeV is more than 6, so this is not allowed. So b and anti-b can't be decay products.

6. t and t̄: way too heavy, 346 GeV, so no.

Leptons:

e+ e-: 1 MeV each, total 1 MeV, allowed.

mu+ mu-: 105.7 MeV each, so 211.4 MeV, allowed.

tau+ tau-: Each tau is about 1.777 GeV, so 3.554 GeV total. 3.554 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so allowed.

What about the charged leptons? The decay would produce a lepton and anti-lepton, so each pair is possible if their combined mass is under 6 GeV.

So possible decay channels are:

uū, dđ, sŝ, cē, e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Wait, but wait. The interaction term is given as involving ψ_f. So which fermions ψ_f are involved? The Lagrangian term shows that X couples to ψ_f. So if ψ_f is, say, a lepton or a quark, that determines which fermions can be decay products.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L = -λ f ψ_f bar (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, perhaps I should parse this correctly. Maybe it's more like λ times f times ψ_f bar times (ῡ + X) times ψ_f. So the interaction is between X and ψ_f, and also between ψ_f and another field, possibly the Higgs field (ῡ?), but that might not matter here.

Wait, perhaps the term is actually the Yukawa coupling. The standard Yukawa interaction is something like L = g ψ ψ ϕ, where ϕ is a scalar. So in this case, the scalar is (ῡ + X), which could be the Higgs field plus the X field. So the interaction would allow X to decay into ψ_f and ψ_f bar, where ψ_f is the fermion in question.

So the possible fermions ψ_f are those that have a Yukawa coupling to X. So which fermions are these? The question doesn't specify, but the options include different fermions, so perhaps we can assume that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the mass is allowed.

Wait, but no, the interaction would only allow decays into fermions that the X couples to. So if the Lagrangian only includes, say, leptons or only quarks, then the possible decay products are limited to those.

But wait, looking at the Lagrangian again, perhaps the term is written as -λ f ψ_f bar (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So the interaction is between the fermion ψ_f and the X field. So ψ_f can be any fermion that has this coupling. For example, maybe ψ_f is a lepton, or a quark.

But without knowing what ψ_f is, perhaps the problem is assuming that X can couple to any fermion, and the possible decays are any fermion-antifermion pair where the combined mass is below 6 GeV.

So, the possible decay products are all fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m_fermion <6 GeV.

So, let's list fermion masses:

Electron: ~0.5 MeV → E+ E-: 1 MeV → allowed.

Muon: ~105.7 MeV → 211.4 MeV allowed.

Tau: ~1.777 GeV → 3.554 GeV <6 GeV: allowed.

Quarks:

u: ~2 MeV → 4 MeV <6 GeV: allowed.

d: ~5 MeV → 10 MeV allowed.

s: ~100 MeV → 200 MeV allowed.

c: ~1.5 GeV → 3 GeV <6 GeV: allowed.

b: ~4.5 GeV → 9 GeV >6 GeV: not allowed.

t: way too heavy, so no.

So possible fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

So possible decay channels are:

uū, dđ, sŝ, cē, e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b, s, u, d, tau, e. Wait, but b would require 9 GeV, which is more than 6, so option A is incorrect as it includes b.

Option B: Includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that would be correct, as c's mass is ~1.5 GeV, so 3 GeV, allowed.

Option C includes t and tau, but t is way too heavy, so option C is incorrect.

Option D includes b and tau, but b is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

Wait, let me look again.

Option A: X→b, s, u, d, tau, e. So it includes b, which is 4.5 GeV each, so 9 GeV total—way over 6 GeV. So A can't be right.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Each of these fermions' pairs would have masses under 6 GeV. So B is possible.

Option C: Includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, and t. But t is too heavy, so no.

Wait, wait:  tau's mass is about 1.777 GeV each, so pair is 3.554 GeV, which is allowed. So tau can be a decay product.

So looking at the options:

Option B lists c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that matches what I have.

Wait, but what about the charged leptons and quarks? The problem is about what's kinematically allowed, so any fermion-antifermion pair where the sum is under 6 GeV is allowed.

So the allowed decay channels are all pairs where the combined mass is less than 6 GeV. So the correct answer should include c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, but not b or t.

Looking at the options, option B includes all except b, but option B doesn't have c. Wait, option B includes c. Let me check:

Option B: X→c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, the option B is written as:

c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}

Yes, that's correct.

Option D has b, which is not allowed, so D is out.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait. The mass of the X boson is 6 GeV, and the mass of the c quark is around 1.27 GeV (maybe I was wrong earlier, perhaps it's closer to 1.2 GeV each). So 2 * 1.27 = ~2.54 GeV < 6 GeV. So c is allowed.

But wait, the problem is about the boson X. The interaction term is given, but maybe the fermions are only certain types. For example, maybe the Lagrangian only includes quarks, or only leptons.

Wait, the problem says the interaction is between X and fermions ψ_f. So can X decay into any fermion as long as the mass allows?

If the interaction is with all fermions, then all allowed pairs are possible.

But, looking at the options, the options include combinations like option B and D.

Wait, but the problem gives multiple-choice options, and option B is the one that includes all possible allowed fermions except the bottom quark and top quark.

So looking at the answer options, the correct decay channels are X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+ e−. So that's option B.

Wait, but another possibility: the Lagrangian term is written as including the Higgs field (ῡ) as well. So maybe ψ_f is a lepton. For example, if ψ_f is a lepton, then the possible decay products would only be leptons and not quarks. But without knowing ψ_f, perhaps the question assumes all possible fermions are available.

Alternatively, maybe the interaction is written as involving Yukawa coupling to fermions, and any fermion can decay as long as the mass is allowed.

So the possible decays are all the ones I listed, which are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

So the option that includes all these is option B.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: X→b, s, u, d, tau, e. Includes b, which is 4.5 GeV each, so 9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so this is impossible. So A is wrong.

Option B: X→c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All allowed.

Option C: Includes t, which is way too heavy. So no.

Option D: Includes b, which is too heavy. So no.

So the correct option is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( \psi \bar{\psi} \)), provided the total mass of the decay products is less than the mass of \( X \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraints**: For a decay \( X \rightarrow \psi \bar{\psi} \) to be kinematically allowed, the combined rest mass of the fermion-antifermion pair must be less than 6 GeV. This is due to energy conservation.

2. **Fermion Masses**:
   - Up quark (\( u \)): ~2 MeV
   - Down quark (\( d \)): ~5 MeV
   - Strange quark (\( s \)): ~100 MeV
   - Charm quark (\( c \)): ~1.5 GeV
   - Bottom quark (\( b \)): ~4.5 GeV (exceeds 6 GeV when paired)
   - Top quark (\( t \)): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)
   - Electron (\( e \)): ~0.5 MeV
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): ~105.7 MeV
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): ~1.777 GeV

3. **Allowed Decays**:
   - \( u \bar{u} \): Total mass ~4 MeV (allowed)
   - \( d \bar{d} \): Total mass ~10 MeV (allowed)
   - \( s \bar{s} \): Total mass ~200 MeV (allowed)
   - \( c \bar{c} \): Total mass ~3 GeV (allowed)
   - \( e^+ e^- \): Total mass ~1 MeV (allowed)
   - \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): Total mass ~211.4 MeV (allowed)
   - \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): Total mass ~3.554 GeV (allowed)
   - \( b \bar{b} \): Total mass ~9 GeV (exceeds 6 GeV, not allowed)
   - \( t \bar{t} \): Total mass ~346 GeV (way too heavy, not allowed)

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which requires a total mass of 9 GeV (exceeds 6 GeV). **Incorrect**.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). All these decays have combined masses less than 6 GeV. **Correct**.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is way too heavy. **Incorrect**.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which requires a total mass of 9 GeV (exceeds 6 GeV). **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
