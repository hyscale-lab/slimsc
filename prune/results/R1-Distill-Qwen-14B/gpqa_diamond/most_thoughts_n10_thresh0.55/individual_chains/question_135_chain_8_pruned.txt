Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. So, the interaction is between the boson X and some fermion fields ψ_f. The structure looks like a Yukawa coupling, right? Because typically, Yukawa interactions are something like g ψ ψ X, where X is a scalar field, which in this case is the boson X.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, X can decay into pairs of fermions, but only if there's enough energy to create those fermions. That's the kinematic part.

So the first thing I need to figure out is what fermions can X decay into. Each possible decay channel would be X → f f̄, where f is a fermion species. For this to happen, the rest mass of the fermion must be less than or equal to half the mass of X, because in the center-of-mass frame, each fermion gets at most half of the X's mass. Since X is 6 GeV, each fermion must be ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The mass of X is 6 GeV, so the maximum possible mass for each fermion in the decay would be 6/2 = 3 GeV. So any fermion with a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

But which fermions are lighter than 3 GeV? Let me list the known fermion masses. 

Quarks: Up and down quarks are light. Their masses are around a few MeV, so definitely under 3 GeV. The strange quark is heavier, maybe about 100 MeV or so. Wait, no, I think the strange quark mass is around 100 MeV (but I'm not entirely sure, perhaps higher). Wait, but let me think: up, down, strange are light quarks, with masses much lower than 1 GeV. Then, the charm quark is much heavier, around 1.5 GeV, I think. The bottom quark is around 4.5-5 GeV, and the top is way too heavy, about 173 GeV.

Leptons: The electron, muon, tau are the charged leptons. The electron is about 0.5 MeV, muon about 105 MeV, tau about 1.78 GeV. Then, the neutrinos are much lighter, but the problem is about charged leptons, I think.

So, for X decaying into fermions f and f̄, the fermion mass m_f must be ≤ 3 GeV. So which fermions satisfy this?

Let me list all possible fermions that could be in the final state:

Quarks:
- u, d: mass < 1 GeV → allowed.
- s: mass ~ 100 MeV, so well under 3 GeV → allowed.
- c: mass ~1.3 GeV → allowed.
- b: around 4.5 GeV → wait, 4.5 is larger than 3 GeV, so X can't decay into b quarks because 4.5 > 3 → not allowed.
- t: way too heavy, so no.

Leptons:
- e: 0.5 MeV → allowed.
- mu: 105 MeV → allowed.
- tau: ~1.78 GeV → allowed.
- The charged leptons' masses are all under 3 GeV except maybe tau is under 3 (it's about 1.78, so yes).

Wait, wait, tau is 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3, so it's allowed.

So, possible fermions in the decay products are:

u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

But wait, the problem is about the interaction term given. The Lagrangian has λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse it correctly. Or perhaps the term is a Yukawa coupling, which would imply that X couples to the fermions f. But in the Lagrangian, the term is -λ f ψ̄_f X ψ_f? Wait, perhaps the term is a Yukawa interaction. So the interaction is proportional to X ψ_f ψ_f.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me re-express it. It's -λ f ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So, this is like a mass term plus a Yukawa coupling to X. So, the Yukawa coupling is with X, and the mass term is from the v term (which is a vacuum expectation value, perhaps, but in this case, it's just a constant).

Wait, but the (v + X) is a scalar, and ψ̄_f and ψ_f are spinors. So, the term would be (v + X) ψ̄_f ψ_f, so this is similar to a mass term, which is why the term is the Yukawa coupling. So, the interaction is such that X couples to the same fermions that v couples to, which would be the same as the mass term. So, the fermions that have mass here would
