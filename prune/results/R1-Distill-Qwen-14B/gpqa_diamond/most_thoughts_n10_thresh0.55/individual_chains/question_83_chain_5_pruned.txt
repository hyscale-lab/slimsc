Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the titration will involve a buffer solution initially and then a salt solution at the equivalence point.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We're diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40.00 cm³ or 0.04 liters. 

First, I need to find the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. The dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L, V2 is 0.04 L. So M2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you mix 20cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20cm³ of water, the amount of acetic acid remains the same. Let me calculate the moles first. Moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume (L). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20cm³ of water, the volume is 40cm³, so the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume needed to reach equivalence can be calculated. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is 1:1. So moles of acetic acid = 0.001 moles. Moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

But the question isn't about the equivalence point yet. It's about the pH at 25% titration and the pH at equivalence.

Let me find what happens at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³. So we're adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to the diluted acetic acid solution.

Wait, let me think again. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So when we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution, what's the new volume? 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

How many moles of NaOH are added? 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1, this will neutralize 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, converting it to acetate ions (CH3COO^-).

Originally, we had 0.001 moles of acetic acid. After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, the moles of acetic acid will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate produced will be 0.00025 moles.

So now, in the solution, we have a buffer of acetic acid and its conjugate base. The pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

What's the pKa? The Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me approximate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733. So pKa ≈4.73.

Now, the concentrations of [A^-] and [HA]. The total volume is 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L. So [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.005882 M. [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) ) = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771. Thus pH = 4.73 + (-0.4771) = approx 4.25.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. Let me compute log(1/3) more precisely. Log(1) is 0, log(3) is 0.4771, so log(1/3) is -0.4771. So 4.73 - 0.4771 is 4.2529, which is approximately 4.25. So the pH at 25% titration is about 4.25.

Looking at the options, let me see. Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, so maybe 4.25 is close to option A's 4.26. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the exact pH at 25% tit
