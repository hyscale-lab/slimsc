Okay, so I have this problem about a diatomic molecule switching states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, wait, the non-rigid rotor usually refers to molecules that can change their bond length, right? But maybe in this context, it's just considering both rotation and vibration.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which for a diatomic molecule would be the v=0 and J=0 state. So vibrationally and rotationally at the lowest point.

They're asking what momentum a photon should have so that the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, the next state with the lowest energy. I think that in the ro-vibrational spectrum, transitions are from the ground vibrational state to the first excited vibrational state, possibly with a change in rotation as well. But wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe the molecule is absorbing a photon that causes it to go to the next higher energy state, which would be the first energy level.

Wait, maybe I should think about the selection rules. For vibration, typically the selection rule is Δv = ±1, and for rotation ΔJ = ±1. But in this case, since we're going from the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0, the next state would probably be v=1, maybe with J changing.

Wait,
