Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, what exactly do I know about the symmetries involved?

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

Lorentz symmetry: I'm pretty sure that SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because if they didn't, the theory would not make sense as a low-energy effective theory. Operators are constructed in such a way that they are Lorentz scalars, so they transform properly under the Lorentz group. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

Poincare symmetry: Wait, Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. So if Lorentz is already a symmetry, then Poincare would imply that the theory is invariant under translations as well. But wait, the SMEFT is valid at low energies, and in effective theories, you can have operators that break some of these symmetries because they come with higher derivatives or higher dimensions. Or wait, no, the operators themselves must be written in a way that respects the symmetries of the underlying theory. Since the Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry, SMEFT should too, right? Because SMEFT is built as a low-energy effective theory of the SM. So operators must be Poincare invariant. So Poincare symmetry (option 2) must be respected as well.

CP symmetry: I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The SM includes CP symmetry, but some extensions (like certain beyond the SM theories) can break CP. But in SMEFT, are operators required to respect CP? Wait, I think that in the SMEFT framework, operators don't necessarily have to respect all the symmetries of the SM. For example, operators can violate CP if the SM allows for such terms. But wait, no. Because the operators are built from the SM fields, and the SM has CP symmetry, but individual terms might not preserve it. Wait, no, the SM can have CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So, operators in SMEFT can include terms that violate CP, if the SM allows for them. But wait, is CP a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT? Or is it allowed to be violated?

Wait, I'm getting
