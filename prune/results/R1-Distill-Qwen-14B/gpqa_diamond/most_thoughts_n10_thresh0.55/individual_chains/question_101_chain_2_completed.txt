Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A to give 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring, right? 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a methyl group on the third carbon of the ring. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Hmm, the substituent is a cyclohexylidene group attached to the methyl, so maybe it's an enamine or something similar.

Wait, enamine formation! That rings a bell. Enamines are typically formed by the reaction of an amine with a ketone or aldehyde. The process usually involves two steps: first, the amine reacts with a carbonyl compound to form an imine, and then the imine undergoes dehydration to form the enamine. And this usually requires an acid catalyst, like TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) or something else.

So in this reaction, 3-methylpyrrolidine is the amine part. The other reactant, compound A, must be a carbonyl compound. Looking at the product, the cyclohexylidene group suggests that the starting aldehyde or ketone was cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or maybe something else.

Let me look at the options. The options are A to D, each with different A and B.

Option A: A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B is TsOH. That makes sense for an enamine formation. The acid would catalyze the imine formation and dehydration.

Option B: A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B is Acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weaker acid compared to TsOH, but it's possible. But I think TsOH is more commonly used as a catalyst for such reactions.

Option C: A is vinylcyclohexane, B is Acetic acid. Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, not a carbonyl. I'm not sure how that would react with an amine under acid conditions. Maybe some kind of addition, but I don't think that's enamine formation.

Option D: A is vinylcyclohexane, B is TsOH. Same issue as option C. So probably not these.

So the reaction must involve a carbonyl reactant, so options A and B are more likely. Now, which catalyst is better? TsOH is a strong acid and is often used in enamine synthesis because it provides the necessary acidic conditions to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, and to deprotonate the amine to form the imine, and then facilitate the dehydration to form the enamine.

Acetic acid is less strong. I think TsOH is more effective here. So the catalyst B should be TsOH, which points to option A.

Wait, but let me think again. What's the product? It's 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The cyclohexylidene group is a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group. So the starting carbonyl should be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO attached to cyclohexane). The reaction of the amine with the aldehyde would form an imine, which would then lose water to form the enamine, which is the product.

So yes, the reagent A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the catalyst is TsOH. So option A is correct.


The reaction involves the acid-catalyzed formation of an enamine between 3-methylpyrrolidine and a carbonyl compound. Enamine synthesis typically requires an amine reacting with a carbonyl (aldehyde or ketone) in the presence of an acid catalyst. The product, 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine, indicates that the starting carbonyl compound must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, as it provides the cyclohexylidene group. The acid catalyst facilitates the formation of the imine intermediate and its subsequent dehydration to form the enamine.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH. This is consistent with enamine formation, as TsOH is a strong acid commonly used for such reactions.
- **Option B**: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid. While acetic acid is an acid, it is weaker than TsOH and less suitable for this reaction.
- **Option C**: A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid. Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, not a carbonyl compound, making it unsuitable for enamine formation.
- **Option D**: A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH. Similar to Option C, vinylcyclohexane is not a carbonyl compound, so this option is invalid.

The correct reagent is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the suitable catalyst is TsOH, making **Option A** the correct choice.

Answer: A
