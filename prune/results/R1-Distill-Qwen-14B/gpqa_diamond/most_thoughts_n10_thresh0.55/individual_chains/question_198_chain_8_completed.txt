Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato, so that's [Co(SCN)₂]²+ maybe? Or maybe it's a different complex. Oh right, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So which β corresponds to that? The complexes are probably formed stepwise. So β1 is for the first SCN- ligand binding: [CoSCN]+, β2 would be adding another SCN to form [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, β3 adding another to make [Co(SCN)₃]^3-, and β4 for the next one, making [Co(SCN)₄]^4- perhaps. But wait, the β values: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that's interesting because β3 is higher than β2 but β4 is lower than β3. So the stability might not keep increasing with each added ligand.

The question is about the percentage of the blue complex. I think the blue one is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+. So we need to find the fraction of Co that is in this form.

So first, I need to calculate the fraction of each complex. The species present are Co²+ (free ion), [CoSCN]^+ (monosulfocyanide), [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ (dithiocyanide), [Co(SCN)3]^3- (trithiocyanide), [Co(SCN)4]^4- (tetrathiocyanide). So five species in total.

The approach is to model the complexation using the stability constants. The idea is to calculate the distribution of each species based on their stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The general approach for such problems is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, using the stability constants. The formation of each complex is a stepwise process where each step adds one SCN- ion.

The formation of each complex can be represented as:

Co²+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [CoSCN]^+ with β1 = [ [CoSCN]^+ ] / ( [Co²+][SCN⁻] ) 

Similarly, [CoSCN]^+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]²+ with β2 = [ [Co(SCN)₂]²+ ] / ( [CoSCN]^+ [SCN⁻] )

And so on for the higher complexes.

But in practice, the overall formation of the complexes can be represented using the cumulative stability constants. The cumulative constant for the n-th complex is the product of β1, β2, ..., βn. Wait, no, actually, the cumulative constant K_n is the product of all β's up to the nth step. So K1 = β1, K2 = β1β2, K3 = β1β2β3, K4 = β1β2β3β4.

Wait, no, actually, the stability constants are given as the formation constants, which are for each step. So to find the fraction of each species, we can model the problem using the formation constants and the given concentrations.

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all species: [Co²+] + [CoSCN]+ + [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ + [Co(SCN)3]^3- + [Co(SCN)4]^4- ] = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But since SCN- is in excess (0.1 M), we can assume that the concentration of SCN- remains approximately constant during the complexation. So [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M.

The problem then reduces to finding the distribution of Co species under these conditions.

The approach is to express each species' concentration in terms of [Co²+], using the stability constants.

Let me denote [Co²+] as x.

Then,

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN^-] = β1 * x * 0.1

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN^-] = β2 * (β1 x 0.1) * 0.1 = β1 β2 x (0.1)^2

Wait, no, wait. The formation of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is from [CoSCN]^+ plus another SCN^-.

So the formation constant for the second step is β2 = [ [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ ] / ( [CoSCN]^+ [SCN^-] )

So [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN^-] 

But [CoSCN]^+ is β1 x [Co²+][SCN^-] = β1 x * 0.1.

So substituting back:

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ = β2 * (β1 x * 0.1) * 0.1 = β1 β2 x (0.1)^2

Similarly, [Co(SCN)3]^3- is formed by adding another SCN^- to [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

The formation constant for step 3 is β3.

So [Co(SCN)3]^3- = β3 * [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ * [SCN^-] 

= β3 * (β1 β2 x 0.1^2 ) * 0.1 

= β1 β2 β3 x (0.1)^3

Similarly, [Co(SCN)4]^4- = β4 * [Co(SCN)3]^3- * [SCN^-]

= β4 * (β1 β2 β3 x 0.1^3 ) * 0.1 

= β1 β2 β3 β4 x (0.1)^4

So all concentrations can be written in terms of x, which is [Co²+].

So total Co concentration is:

x + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ + [Co(SCN)3]^3- + [Co(SCN)4]^4- ] = 1e-2

Substituting each term in terms of x:

x + (β1 * x * 0.1) + (β1 β2 x (0.1)^2 ) + (β1 β2 β3 x (0.1)^3 ) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 x (0.1)^4 ) = 1e-2

Factor out x:

x [ 1 + β1 * 0.1 + β1 β2 (0.1)^2 + β1 β2 β3 (0.1)^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 (0.1)^4 ] = 1e-2

So x = (1e-2) / [ 1 + β1*(0.1) + β1β2*(0.1)^2 + β1β2β3*(0.1)^3 + β1β2β3β4*(0.1)^4 ]

Once we calculate x, we can find the concentration of each species and then find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

Let me compute each term step by step.

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each term inside the brackets:

Term1: 1

Term2: β1 * 0.1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term3: β1 β2 * (0.1)^2 = 9 *40 * 0.01 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

Wait, 9 *40 is 360, times 0.01 is 3.6.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 * (0.1)^3 = 9*40*63 * 0.001

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. Multiply by 0.001: 22.68.

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 * (0.1)^4 = 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16=362,880.

Multiply by (0.1)^4=1e-4 → 362880 *1e-4 =36.288.

So now sum all terms:

Term1: 1

Term2: 0.9 → total so far 1.9

Term3: 3.6 → total 5.5

Term4:22.68 → total 5.5 +22.68=28.18

Term5:36.288 → total 28.18+36.288=64.468

So the denominator is 64.468.

x = (1e-2) / 64.468 ≈ 1.5513e-4 M.

Wait, let me compute 1e-2 is 0.01. 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.00015513.

So x = [Co²+] ≈1.5513e-4 M.

Now, compute each species:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * 0.1 =9 * 1.5513e-4 *0.1 =9 * 0.1 * 1.5513e-4 = 0.9 *1.5513e-4 =1.3962e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ =β1 β2 x (0.1)^2 =9*40 *1.5513e-4 *0.01.

9*40=360 → 360 *1.5513e-4 = 0.0558468. Multiply by 0.01 → 0.000558468 M.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute each step.

Alternatively:

[Co(SCN)₂]²+ = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN^-]

[CoSCN]^+ is 1.3962e-4, [SCN^-] is 0.1.

So [Co(SCN)₂]²+ =40 * 1.3962e-4 *0.1 =40 * 1.3962e-5 =5.5848e-4 M.

Wait, but earlier calculation using the terms in the denominator gave me a different value. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me clarify.

Actually, perhaps I should compute each species using the terms I have.

Wait, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is β1 β2 x (0.1)^2.

So 9*40=360; 360 *1.5513e-4 (x) = 360 *1.5513e-4 = 0.0558468. Multiply by (0.1)^2=0.01 → 0.0558468 *0.01 = 0.000558468 M.

Wait, but that's 5.58468e-4 M.

Which matches the second method. So both methods give the same result.

So [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is 5.58468e-4 M.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)3]^3- = β3 * [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ * [SCN^-]

Which is 63 *5.58468e-4 *0.1.

Compute 63 *5.58468e-4 = 0.035198244. Multiply by 0.1 → 3.5198244e-5 M.

And [Co(SCN)4]^4- = β4 * [Co(SCN)3]^3- * [SCN^-]

16 *3.5198244e-5 *0.1 =16 *3.5198244e-6 ≈5.631719e-5 M.

So now, all species:

Co²+: x ≈1.5513e-4 → 0.00015513 M.

[CoSCN]^+ →1.3962e-4 → 0.00013962 M.

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ →5.58468e-4 →0.000558468 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^3- →3.5198e-5 →0.000035198 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^4- →5.6317e-5 →0.000056317 M.

Let me sum these to check if they add up to 1e-2.

1.5513e-4 =0.00015513

1.3962e-4 =0.00013962 → sum so far 0.00029475.

Plus 5.58468e-4 →0.000558468 → total 0.000853218.

Add 3.5198e-5 →0.000035198 → total 0.000888416.

Add 5.6317e-5 →0.000056317 → total 0.000944733.

Wait, the total is about 0.0009447 which is less than 0.01. Hmm, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculations. Let me recalculate the terms.

Wait, in the denominator, the sum was 64.468, and x is 1e-2 divided by that, which is 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.00015513.

So x is 0.00015513.

[CoSCN]^+ =9 *0.00015513 *0.1 = 9 *0.000015513 =0.000139617.

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ =40 * [CoSCN]^+ *0.1 → 40 *0.000139617 *0.1 =40 *0.0000139617=0.000558468.

[Co(SCN)3]^3- =63 * [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ *0.1 → 63 *0.000558468 *0.1 =63 *0.0000558468 ≈0.0035198.

Wait, that can’t be right because 63 *0.000558468 is 0.035198, then multiplied by 0.1 → 0.0035198. But that's larger than the initial x. Hmm, that can't be right because 0.0035 is way bigger than the total Co of 0.01.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in calculation. Let me re-calculate each step.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recompute [Co(SCN)3]^3-:

[Co(SCN)3]^3- = β3 * [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ * [SCN^-]

β3 is 63, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is 0.000558468 M, [SCN^-] is 0.1.

So 63 * 0.000558468 = 0.035198244. Multiply by 0.1 → 0.0035198244.

That's 0.0035198244 M.

Wait, that's 3.52e-3 M, which is larger than the initial Co concentration of 0.01 M. That can't be possible because the sum can't exceed the total.

Wait, no, the total is 0.01 M, but this step's contribution is 0.0035, which is 3.5 mM, which is less than 10 mM. But I must have made a mistake because the sum seems too high.

Hold on, let me recalculate all species:

x = [Co²+] = 0.00015513 M.

[CoSCN]^+ =9 * 0.00015513 *0.1 → 0.000139617 M.

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ =40 * 0.000139617 *0.1 → 40 *0.0000139617=0.000558468 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^3- =63 * 0.000558468 *0.1 →63 *0.0000558468=0.0035198244 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^4- =16 * 0.0035198244 *0.1 →16 *0.00035198244=0.005631719 M.

Wait, now let's sum all these up:

x: 0.00015513

[CoSCN]+: 0.000139617 → total so far 0.000294747.

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+: 0.000558468 → total 0.000853215.

[Co(SCN)3]^3-: 0.0035198244 → total 0.004373039.

[Co(SCN)4]^4-:0.005631719 → total 0.009999758 M.

Ah, that's approximately 0.01 M, which matches the total Co concentration. So I must have made a mistake earlier in the sum.

So [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is 0.000558468 M, and the total is 0.01 M.

The percentage of blue dithiocyanato complex is ([Co(SCN)₂]^2+ / total) * 100.

So 0.000558468 / 0.01 = 0.0558468 → 5.58468% → approximately 5.58%? But looking at the options, none of them are around 5%. Hmm, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. Wait, none near 5.5%. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the fraction of each species using the expression for each in terms of x, and then the fractions would be (concentration of species) / total.

So the fractions would be:

f1 = [Co²+] / c_total = x / c_total

f2 = [CoSCN]^+ / c_total = (β1 x [SCN^-]) / c_total

Similarly,

f3 = (β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2 ) / c_total

f4 = (β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3 ) / c_total

f5 = (β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4 ) / c_total

But c_total = x (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

So, in terms of fractions, each fraction is the product of the stability constants up to that species, multiplied by [SCN^-] to the appropriate power, all divided by the sum of all terms.

So the fraction for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is (β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 ) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

So the denominator is the same as before, which was 64.468.

The numerator for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is β1 β2 (0.1)^2 =9 *40 *0.01= 360 *0.01=3.6.

So the fraction is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05556, or about 5.556%.

Wait, but that's about 5.5%, which is not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the β values are for the overall formation constants, not stepwise. Or maybe I messed up the order of the complexes.

Wait, let me double-check the β values and their order. The problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

I'm assuming that β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, etc. But maybe the numbering is different. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the complexes form in a stepwise manner, but the overall stability constant for each complex is given. So [Co(SCN)]^+ has β1=9, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ has β2=40 (which would be β2/β1?), but that doesn't fit.

Wait, the usual way is that βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, etc. So the approach I took earlier is correct.

Hmm, so why are the options way higher than 5%? Unless I have the wrong [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ concentration.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the denominator. Let's recalculate the denominator:

1 + β1*(0.1) + β1β2*(0.1)^2 + β1β2β3*(0.1)^3 + β1β2β3β4*(0.1)^4

Compute each term:

Term1:1

Term2:9 *0.1=0.9 → sum=1.9

Term3:9*40 *0.01= 360 *0.01=3.6 → sum=5.5

Term4:9*40 *63 *0.001 → compute 9*40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *0.001=22.68 → sum=28.18

Term5:9*40*63*16 *0.0001 → compute 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880; 362880 *0.0001=36.288 → sum=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is correct.

But then, the fraction is 3.6 /64.468= 0.05556 →5.556%.

But the options are all much higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the [SCN^-] isn't 0.1 M? No, the problem states that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Wait, another possibility is that the blue complex refers to a different species, not [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

Wait, the problem says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". Wait, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is a dithiocyanato complex. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is a higher or lower n species.

Wait, I think the blue color is typically associated with [Co(SCN)6]^3- complex, which is a deep blue. But in this problem, the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, [Co(SCN)3]^3-, [Co(SCN)4]^4-.

Wait, [Co(SCN)6]^3- is a different case, but since the β4 is given as 16, perhaps the highest complex here is [Co(SCN)4]^4-.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which would be [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ perhaps.

Wait, but in any case, according to my calculations, the percentage is around 5.5%, which is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the β values are for the overall formation constants, not stepwise. So let's consider that approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the β values are cumulative, not stepwise. That is, βn is the overall formation constant for the n-th complex.

For example, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+ → β1 = [CoSCN]^+ / ([Co²+][SCN^-])

β2 is for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ → β2 = [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ / ([Co²+][SCN^-]^2 )

In that case, the approach would be different. Because each subsequent β is larger than the previous cumulative β.

Wait, the values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Hmm, but 40 is larger than 9, 63>40, but 16<63. So if β4 is 16, which is less than β3, that would imply that the fourth complex is less stable than the third. So perhaps the complexes increase up to n=3, then decrease. But that's unusual; normally, metal complexes have increasing stability with more ligands, but not always.

So if the β values are for the overall complexes, then the fraction of each species would be determined by βn * [SCN^-]^n, divided by the sum over all possible n of βn [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, if that's the case, let's recalculate.

The species are:

n=0: Co²+ → β0=1 (assumed), [SCN^-]^0=1.

n=1: [CoSCN]^+ → β1=9, [SCN^-]^1=0.1.

n=2: [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ → β2=40, [SCN^-]^2=0.01.

n=3: [Co(SCN)3]^3- → β3=63, [SCN^-]^3=0.001.

n=4: [Co(SCN)4]^4- → β4=16, [SCN^-]^4=0.0001.

So the fraction of each species is (βn [SCN^-]^n) / sum(βm [SCN^-]^m )

So sum = β0*(0.1)^0 + β1*(0.1)^1 + β2*(0.1)^2 + β3*(0.1)^3 + β4*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

β0*(1) =1*1=1.

β1*(0.1)=9*0.1=0.9 → sum so far 1.9.

β2*(0.01)=40 *0.01=0.4 → sum 2.3.

β3*(0.001)=63 *0.001=0.063 → sum 2.363.

β4*(0.0001)=16 *0.0001=0.0016 → sum 2.3646.

So sum=2.3646.

The fraction for n=2 is (40 * 0.01 ) / 2.3646 =0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.1691, or about 16.91%.

Which is option D: 16.9%.

So that would be the percentage of dithiocyanato complex.

Wait, but why would the β values be given as overall formation constants rather than stepwise? The problem states that they're the stability constants of the complexes. Typically, stability constants are given as stepwise constants (β) for each addition of a ligand.

But in this case, if the β values are for the overall formation, then the calculation gives 16.9%, which is option D.

But earlier when I considered stepwise β's, I got about 5.5%, which isn't one of the options.

So perhaps the β values are overall, not stepwise. The problem might have meant the overall stability constants, not stepwise.

In that case, the fraction is about 16.9%, which matches option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt complexes using the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ (1 × 10⁻² M) and SCN⁻ (0.1 M). The stability constants are assumed to be overall formation constants for each complex, not stepwise constants.

The total concentration of cobalt is distributed among the following species:

- Free Co²⁺
- [CoSCN]⁺
- [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺
- [Co(SCN)₃]³⁻
- [Co(SCN)₄]⁴⁻

The fraction of each species is determined by the expression:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
\]

Here, \( \beta_0 = 1 \) for the free Co²⁺ species, and \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The denominator is the sum of all terms \( \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m \) for \( m = 0 \) to \( 4 \).

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
\[
\text{Denominator} = \beta_0 (0.1)^0 + \beta_1 (0.1)^1 + \beta_2 (0.1)^2 + \beta_3 (0.1)^3 + \beta_4 (0.1)^4
\]
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 \cdot 1 + 9 \cdot 0.1 + 40 \cdot 0.01 + 63 \cdot 0.001 + 16 \cdot 0.0001
\]
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺
The fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺ corresponds to \( n = 2 \):
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}}
\]
\[
f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646}
\]
\[
f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot 0.01}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1691
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
\[
\text{Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺} = f_2 \cdot 100 = 0.1691 \cdot 100 \approx 16.9\%
