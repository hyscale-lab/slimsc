Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about decay distance. I think the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, because particles that live longer can travel further before decaying.

So the problem gives me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I remember that the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, Γ is the width, which is the total decay width, right?

Wait, but let me think. The width Γ is the energy uncertainty, so the uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ. And the uncertainty in time Δt is τ, so ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Or maybe it's ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, depending on the exact formulation. I think the relation is Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But I'm not 100% sure about the exact factors. Oh well, perhaps the exact formula is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. Let's go with that.

Once I have the lifetime τ, the mean decay distance would be the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. So, distance L = v * τ. But wait, since the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, I should consider its velocity in terms of the speed of light. So L = c * τ * β, where β is v/c.

Alternatively, since β = p/(E), where p is the momentum and E is the total energy. Hmm, because for relativistic particles, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So perhaps I can calculate β from E and m.

Wait, let's get the steps straight. First, find the lifetime τ. Then, find the velocity β, then compute L = c * τ * β.

But wait, the energy given is E_X = 8 GeV. That's the total energy of the meson, right? The mass-energy is m_X c² = 1.2 GeV. So the particle is moving with E_X = 8 GeV, which is much larger than its rest mass, so it's definitely
