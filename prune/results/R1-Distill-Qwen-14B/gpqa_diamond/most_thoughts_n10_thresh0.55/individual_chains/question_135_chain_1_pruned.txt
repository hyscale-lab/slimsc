Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. Hmm, bosons usually mediate forces, like photons or W and Z bosons. But here, the interaction is given by a Lagrangian.

The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄ f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, that looks a bit confusing. Let me try to parse this. It seems like the boson X is interacting with fermions. The general form might involve the Yukawa coupling, which is usually something like g ψ ψ X, where ψ is a fermion field. So this term probably represents the interaction between the boson X and various fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. Now, the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into, based on conservation laws and the masses involved.

First, the decay process would be X → f f̄, right? So X must have enough mass to produce the fermion pair. The mass of X is 6 GeV, so any fermion pair whose combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV should be allowed.

Wait, but each fermion has its own mass. For example, up and down quarks are light, but others like charm, bottom are heavier. Let me list the masses of the fermions:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV

So for X to decay into a pair of fermions f and f̄, the total mass of the pair must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the threshold for a decay is when the mass of the particle is equal to twice the mass of the fermion (since each fermion has mass m, so 2m).

So let's see which fermions have 2m ≤ 6 GeV.

- e: 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 GeV → allowed
- μ: 0.21 GeV → allowed
- τ: 3.554 GeV → allowed (since 3.554 < 6)
- u: 0.006 GeV → allowed
- d: 0.008 GeV → allowed
- s: 0.19 GeV → allowed
- c: 2.55 GeV → allowed (2.55 <6)
- b: 8.26 GeV → 8.26 >6 → not allowed
- t: way too heavy, 346 GeV → not allowed.

Wait, but wait a second. The top quark is way heavier, but the bottom quark is about 4 GeV, so 2m is about 8 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. Same with t, but t is even heavier, so not allowed either.

So the possible fermions that X can decay into are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, and c.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−. But wait, this includes b, which is 4 GeV each, so 8 GeV total. X is 6 GeV, so that's not allowed. So option A is incorrect because it includes b.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−. Let's check the masses. The c c̄ pair is 2.55 GeV, which is allowed. s s̄ is 0.19 GeV. u, d are even lighter. τ is 1.777 GeV each, so 3.55 GeV total. Muon is 0.105 GeV, so 0.21 total. Electron is negligible. All these are below 6 GeV. But option B includes c, which is allowed. So possible.

Wait, but option B doesn't have b. So that's good because X can't decay into b.

Option C: Includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is 173 GeV each, so 346 GeV. X is only 6 GeV, can’t decay into t. So option C is wrong.

Option D: Includes b, which is 8 GeV, so not allowed. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me check again.

Option A includes b, which is bad. So A is incorrect.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So 2m for c is 2.55 GeV, yes. So that's allowed. So why is option B including c? Because 2.55 is less than 6, yes.

Wait, but looking at the options, I thought option
