Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We have an electron state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, S_z. We need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and zero otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. So the first thing I think about is that |up> and |down> form an orthonormal basis, which is the standard basis for the Pauli matrices, I think. So the state |alpha> is a linear combination of these two states.

Wait, but the problem says |alpha> is proportional to that combination, so I should normalize it first. Because probabilities are based on the squared magnitudes of the coefficients. So let me write down the state.

Let me denote |up> as |0> and |down> as |1> for simplicity. So |alpha> can be written as c_0 |0> + c_1 |1>, where c_0 = (1 + i) and c_1 = (2 - i).

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem states that |alpha> is proportional to this. So the actual state is proportional, meaning it's not necessarily normalized. So I'll need to find the normalization constant first.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So let's compute |c_0|^2 + |c_1|^2 divided by the square of the normalization constant equals 1. Wait, no, because the state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, so the normalization factor is 1 / sqrt(|c0|^2 + |c1|^2). So let's calculate |c0|^2 and |c1|^2.

c0 is (1 + i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + ib|^2 = a^2 + b^2. So |1+i|² is 1^2 + 1^2 = 2.
