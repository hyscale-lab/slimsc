Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

First, I need to understand the parameters. The key points are the apparent V magnitude each spectrograph can observe. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, meaning apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. HIRES can go down to 16 mag, so apparent V mag less than or equal to 16. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detected by HIRES, and it must also be ≤17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, no, the way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, brightness is lower magnitude. So brighter than 17 means V mag <17. Because smaller magnitudes are brighter. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag ≤17. HIRES can observe stars with V mag ≤16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition.

Wait, no. Because HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So that's V mag <16. Because if a star is brighter than magnitude 16
