Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. The problem is about identifying the product of a reaction involving Compound X, which has given IR and NMR data. The reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, maybe it's another reaction. Or could it be related to the hydrolysis of an ester? Or perhaps a substitution reaction. Hmm, I need to think.

First, I should analyze the IR and NMR data of Compound X to figure out what it is. Let's go step by step.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Also, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak. For carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, but esters are usually higher, like 1720-1760. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad around 2500-3000, which is present here. Oh, but wait, the 3400–2500 region is a broad stretch. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol with a carbonyl, but the 1720 is more likely a ketone or an ester. Hmm, but the broad peak suggests -OH, perhaps from a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is a nitrile, which has a peak around 2200, which isn't here. So, maybe a carbonyl group and an -OH group.

Looking at the NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very downfield peak, which is typical for a carboxylic acid proton. The broad singlet (bs) supports that because carboxylic acids have broad peaks due to hydrogen bonding. So this might be the -COOH proton.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would show a very broad O-H stretch around
