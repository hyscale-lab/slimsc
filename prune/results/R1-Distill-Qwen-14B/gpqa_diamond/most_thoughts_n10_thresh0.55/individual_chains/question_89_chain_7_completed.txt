Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the answer step by step. Let's go through it methodically.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a diamond-like shape. The 1,3-dibromo part means there are two bromine atoms attached at the 1 and 3 positions of this adamantane structure.

The first step is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. Oh wait, KOH is a strong base, and in such conditions, elimination reactions typically occur. Dibromides often undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So, when two bromides are present, especially in a vicinal position (like 1 and 2 would be), they can eliminate two HBr molecules to form a double bond. But here, the positions are 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Hmm, but wait, in adamantane, the positions 1 and 3 might be on adjacent carbon atoms if the structure allows. Because adamantane has a cage structure, so maybe the 1 and 3 positions are actually on adjacent carbons, making them vicinal. So, heating with KOH (a strong base) would lead to an E2 elimination, forming an alkene.

So, product 1 is likely to be 1,3-adamantadiene or maybe a more substituted alkene. Wait, no, because when you eliminate two HBr molecules from adjacent bromides, you form a double bond. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr to form 1,3-adamantadiene? No, wait, maybe I'm confusing the positions. Alternatively, perhaps each bromide is on a bridgehead carbon. Wait, adamantane's structure has bridgehead carbons—each bridgehead has two adjacent bridge carbons. So, 1 and 3 might be on opposite bridgeheads. Wait, no, perhaps it's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs at each end. Wait, I think I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the product. The NMR data for product 1 shows specific signals.

Looking at the 1H NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or an epoxide? Wait, no, maybe it's a carbonyl group. Wait, but the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group—like a ketone or an ester or an aldehyde. Hmm, but an aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, which isn't in the given NMR. So maybe a ketone.

Wait, if the IR shows 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl. So Product 1 must have a ketone group. So, how did we get a ketone from a dibromide?

Ah, wait. Maybe the initial reaction is not elimination but a substitution. But wait, KOH is a base, so it might lead to elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely that when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, it undergoes a double elimination, forming a double bond and releasing two HBr molecules. But then, how does that give a ketone?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure is such that after elimination, there's a ring opening or some rearrangement. Or maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, wait, another possibility: Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that typically gives alkenes. Alternatively, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but that's elimination. So product 1 would be an alkene, but the NMR doesn't directly show that.

Wait, the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm is a singlet of 2H. That could be an ether's CH2, but why would that be the case? Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group attached to a CH2. But wait, if it's a ketone, then perhaps the structure is an adamantyl group with a ketone group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. For example, if KOH causes the dibromide to substitute to a diol. But that would give a diol, but the IR would then show O-H stretching, which would be around 3300 cm-1, but the given IR is at 1720. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction forms a cyclic ether via an elimination followed by ring formation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl group via oxidation. Wait, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Oh, wait, wait! KOH could deprotonate something, but in this case, maybe it's a double elimination.

Wait, perhaps it's a double E2 elimination, leading to the formation of two double bonds. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, maybe each bromide is on a bridgehead, and elimination forms a bridgehead double bond. But I thought bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule, but in adamantane derivatives, it's possible. So, maybe the product is an adamantene with a double bond at the bridgehead.

Wait, but how does that tie into the NMR and IR data? The IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe after elimination, some kind of oxidation occurs. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction is heating with KOH. Maybe it's not elimination but something else. Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide. But wait, for epoxide formation, you typically need a peracid or something else. Oh wait, wait—maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming an epoxide via elimination. Wait, but when you have vicinal dihalides (two adjacent bromines), you can form an epoxide by eliminating two molecules of HBr, but that would require a peracid or another oxidizing agent, not KOH. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms a diol via substitution. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH would substitute each Br with OH, giving 1,3-adamantanediol. Then, perhaps this diol is dehydrated to form an epoxide, but that would require acid, not base. Or maybe the diol is further reacted.

But looking back at the IR, the 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the diol undergoes some kind of oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is elimination to form an alkene, and then some further reaction. Wait, maybe the alkene is oxidized. But without an oxidizing agent, that's unlikely.

Wait, another angle: The initial product has a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is a CH2 group. Maybe this is a carbonyl group adjacent to a CH2. Like a ketone with a CH2 next to it. For example, R-CO-CH2-R.

If the IR is 1720 cm-1, that would fit with a ketone. So perhaps product 1 is an adamantyl ketone. How would that form?

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that's more for arenes. Alternatively, maybe the dibromide is treated with KOH, but under certain conditions, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack leading to ring opening. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzylic type of elimination.

Wait, perhaps the 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, and each Br is eliminated as Br- with H from adjacent carbons, leading to two double bonds? But that might require a more complex structure.

Wait, perhaps it's a pinacol-like elimination. Pinacol rearrangement is where a 1,2-diol loses water to form a carbonyl. But in this case, perhaps a di-bromide undergoing elimination to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but di-bromides are generally not directly involved in such rearrangements. Alternatively, maybe the KOH induces elimination of two HBr molecules, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, okay, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structure of product 1. If the IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl, and the NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 for 2H, perhaps those are the two protons adjacent to the carbonyl.

So, maybe the structure is something like an adamantane ring with a carbonyl group attached, with two adjacent CH2 groups. For example, (CH2)2CO-adamantane. So the NMR would show the CH2 next to the carbonyl as a singlet because they're equivalent and not split by any neighboring protons. So, that would fit 4.79 ppm.

So, product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone or a similar ketone. How would that form? Well, if the 1,3-dibromide undergoes two elimination reactions, each losing HBr, but how does that form a ketone?

Wait, wait. Another approach: perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and each elimination leads to the formation of a double bond, but then a ring contraction or expansion forms the ketone. Or perhaps each elimination leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and eliminating each gives a carbonyl group. But that doesn't make much sense because elimination typically forms alkenes, not carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a double bond, but if the structure allows for further reaction, perhaps another elimination occurs, leading to a carbonyl. Like, maybe two eliminations occur, each losing an HBr, and the double bonds combine or rearrange to form a carbonyl.

But I'm not sure about the exact mechanism here. Maybe it's more straightforward. Let's think about the NMR and IR data again.

So product 1 has a carbonyl (IR 1720), and the 1H NMR shows a singlet for 2H at 4.79. That suggests a -CH2- group adjacent to the carbonyl. So, the structure is likely a cyclohexane ring (part of adamantane) with a ketone and a CH2 group attached.

Wait, maybe the structure is a secondary or tertiary ketone. Considering adamantane's structure, the carbonyl would be in a position where it's part of the ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bridged ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial elimination forms an alkyl bromide that then undergoes further reaction, but I'm not seeing it.

Moving on, let's think about the second step: product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the Friedel-Crafts acylation is used to add another acyl group. But wait, product 1 is already a ketone; maybe it's more about introducing a new acyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the Lewis acid helps in the formation of an enol or enolate, leading to some kind of rearrangement. Or maybe it's a Claisen rearrangement or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but earlier I thought that might not fit the IR. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Because when two vicinal bromides undergo elimination with a base, they can form an alkene. But under certain conditions, maybe they form an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxide formation requires a peracid or a similar oxidizing agent. So, that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but then the IR wouldn't have a strong carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. If the two bromines were on adjacent carbons, elimination of HBr from each would form two carbonyl groups. So, maybe 1,3-diketone? But then the NMR would show more peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the two bromines are on the same carbon, but that's not the case here as it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

I'm getting a bit stuck on the first step, but let's proceed and see if the next steps can help.

Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, which is a reductive workup. Ozone treatment typically leads to cleavage of double bonds into carbonyl groups (ozone followed by reductive workup, like with dimethyl sulfide, would break double bonds into ketones or aldehydes).

So, for product 3, the NMR will show the results of this cleavage.

But wait, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So, the most deshielded hydrogen would be near electronegative groups or in a conjugated system.

Let me think about what product 2 would look like. If product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed by heating with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it's involved in some kind of Friedel-Crafts acylation. Wait, but if product 1 is already a ketone, maybe product 2 is the result of another reaction, like forming an acylium ion or facilitating some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an alkene, then heating with aluminum isopropoxide might lead to some kind of addition or polymerization, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alkene. Then, product 2 would have some kind of addition across the double bond.

Wait, but if product 1 is an alkene, heating with a Lewis acid might cause it to undergo some kind of cycloaddition or catalyze a reaction. Alternatively, maybe the alkene is used in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that would require an acylium ion or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which then undergoes some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink the initial step.

Let me think about 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Each bridgehead has two Br atoms. When heated with KOH, perhaps each Br is eliminated with adjacent H's, forming a double bond. But since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two eliminations occur, leading to two adjacent double bonds, making a conjugated diene. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond. But as I thought earlier, that's against Bredt's rule, but adamantane might allow it.

So, if product 1 is a diene (maybe a conjugated diene within the adamantane structure), then the IR wouldn't show a strong carbonyl peak. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an OH group, making a diol. Then, the diol is dehydrated to form an epoxide. But how would that fit with the IR and NMR data?

Wait, if product 1 is a diol, the IR would show broad O-H stretches, which would be around 3300-3500 cm-1, but the given IR is at 1720, which is more consistent with a carbonyl. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a carbonyl group. Let me think: If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl.

Wait, that would require each Br to be on a carbon adjacent to another Br, but that's not the case here. Unless the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane allows for a conjugated elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a carbon that can eliminate to form a carbonyl. Wait, but elimination typically forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless... wait, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of ring contraction or expansion to form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps each elimination forms a double bond, and then some rearrangement forms a ketone. For example, if the double bonds are conjugated, perhaps a [3,3] sigmatropic shift (like a Cope rearrangement) forms a ketone. But I'm not sure about the exact structure here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an adamantyl group with a ketone, and the NMR shows the CH2 next to the carbonyl as a singlet. So, product 1 is a ketone, and the next steps are based on that.

Moving on, product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. Let's assume product 1 is a ketone, say adamantanone. Heating with a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3 might facilitate a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but since adamantane is already quite bulky, maybe it's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the Lewis acid induces some kind of enol formation, leading to a conjugate addition or some rearrangement.

Wait, maybe the ketone undergoes some kind of aldol condensation, but without a base, that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen rearrangement, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the Lewis acid causes the ketone to form an acylium ion, which could then undergo some kind of addition or ring expansion. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a carbonyl, and product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of enol, but I'm not sure.

Now, the third step: ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have carbonyls where the double bond was. The question is about the NMR of product 3, focusing on the most deshielded hydrogen.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen would probably be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's think about the structure after ozonolysis.

If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would split it into two carbonyl groups. If it's a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would form two carbonyls, maybe leading to separate aldehydes or ketones.

But in any case, the NMR would show the protons near the carbonyls as more deshielded.

Wait, if the most deshielded hydrogen is in a terminal position, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde. But aldehydes have protons around 9-10 ppm, but in the NMR data, the question is about product 3.

Wait, the question says, in the 1H NMR of product 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent).

Hmm, thinking about the possible coupling patterns.

If the most deshielded H is adjacent to a CH2 group, which is next to a carbonyl, then perhaps it's a CH2 group, but more likely, it's a CH group attached to a carbonyl, which is then attached to another CH2.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to a diketone, where the H in question is on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but let's try to reconstruct the entire process.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (after KOH) → product 2 (after Al(i-Pr)3) → product 3 (after ozonolysis and workup).

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, product 2 might be a dienone (a ketone with a double bond adjacent), and then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, adding an O.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial elimination forms a conjugated diene, product 1. Then, when product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3, maybe it undergoes some kind of Diels-Alder reaction, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Alternatively, product 2 could be a dienol ether or some other structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, product 2 is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit with the initial IR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is a diepoxide, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diene, product 1, then product 2 is a mixture of reaction products when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps forming some kind of acylium ion or facilitating a Diels-Alder-like reaction.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a dienone, with a conjugated carbonyl group.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond. Suppose product 2 is a dienone (two conjugated double bonds and a ketone). Ozonolysis would break the conjugated double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not getting much further without a clear understanding of product 1.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but that wouldn't fit the IR. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the NMR data of product 1 again. The NMR shows 4.79 (2H, singlet), 2.41-2.23 (10H, which is probably the adamantane structure with some CH2 groups), 1.94 (2H, maybe another CH2 group).

Wait, 10H in the range 2.41-2.23 ppm suggests a set of equivalent protons in a ring structure. Adamantane has a lot of CH2 groups, each in a specific environment. The 2H at 4.79 ppm (singlet) is likely a group that's not split, perhaps a CH2 next to an oxygen or a carbonyl.

So, perhaps the product is a ketone with a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

If that's the case, product 1 is an adamantyl ketone.

Then, product 2 would be formed by treating this ketone with Al(i-Pr)3. Perhaps the Lewis acid induces some kind of enol formation, leading to a conjugated system. For example, the ketone could tautomerize or form an enol, which might then react further.

Alternatively, maybe the Al(i-Pr)3 facilitates a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but since adamantane is a polycyclic structure, it's possible that the ketone doesn't undergo further acylation. Alternatively, maybe it forms an enol ether or some other structure.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the ketone reacts with the Lewis acid to form an acylium ion, which could then undergo some kind of rearrangement. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the Al(i-Pr)3 acts as a catalyst for a ring-opening reaction, but that's speculative.

Assuming that product 2 has a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group, then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond. For example, if product 2 is a dienone (two conjugated double bonds and a ketone), ozonolysis would break the double bonds into carbonyl groups. This would result in product 3 having additional carbonyl groups.

In the NMR, the most deshielded protons would be near these carbonyls. For example, if there's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, the protons would be deshielded and appear around 2.2-2.4 ppm, but that's not the most deshielded. Alternatively, if there's an aldehyde proton, it would be around 9-10 ppm, but that's not mentioned in the options.

Wait, but the question says "excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent." So, any acidic protons like -OH or -NH would exchange and not be observed. So, the most deshielded would likely be a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl.

But wait, considering the coupling patterns, let's think about what kind of splitting would occur. If a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl, each H on CH2 would couple with the neighboring CH2's H. For example, if it's a CH2-CO-CH2- structure, each proton would be a quartet (from coupling with the adjacent CH2's two H), but that's a pentet if more coupling occurs.

Wait, but maybe the structure is more complex. Suppose after ozonolysis, product 3 has a structure with multiple adjacent CH2 groups, each coupling with each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, which is next to another CH2 group, leading to a more complex coupling pattern.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. If a proton is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, which is itself adjacent to another CH2 group, each proton on the first CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would have a triplet (coupled with two H from the next CH2). But if there's another coupling partner, like a neighboring CH2 group further along, it could lead to more splits.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a carbonyl and also near another CH2 group that's further away, perhaps the splitting becomes a triplet of triplets or some more complex pattern.

Wait, but the most deshielded H in product 3 would be the one closest to the carbonyl. If it's a CH2 next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is between two other CH2 groups, then each H would have coupling with two adjacent Hs on each side. So, each H would see two H on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, no, because each H can only couple with Hs on adjacent carbons. Let's say the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-... Then, the Hs on the CH2 next to CO would couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. Each H on the first CH2 would see two H on the next CH2, leading to a triplet. So, each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but if the Hs are also coupled to Hs on a neighboring group, like another CH2, perhaps via vicinal coupling, it could lead to a more complex pattern. But typically, J values for vicinal coupling are smaller and might not be observed, or they could be averaged out.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to an electronegative atom, causing more splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the most deshielded H is on a CH group, like a ketone adjacent to a CH group. For example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-..., but that's speculative.

Wait, let's consider an example. Suppose product 3 has a structure like (CH2)2CO. Then, the CH2 next to the CO would have Hs that are split by the adjacent CH2. So, each H on the first CH2 would see two H on the next CH2, leading to a triplet.

But if that CH2 is also next to another CH2 group, perhaps a longer chain, then coupling could occur with more Hs.

Wait, but the options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

If the H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two H from the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet.

But if the adjacent CH2 is itself next to another CH2, then the coupling could be more complex. For example, if the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, then the Hs on the first CH2 would see two Hs from the next CH2, and perhaps also some coupling with the next group.

Wait, perhaps the Hs are on a CH2 group that's part of a longer chain, like CH2-CH2-CO. Then, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two H on the adjacent CH2, making a triplet. Additionally, if the adjacent CH2 is itself coupled to another CH2, the first H might also see those, but that's a longer coupling which is usually not observed unless the J value is significant.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, such as in a propenone structure. But without more structural information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the H is part of a cyclopropane ring, but that's speculative.

Wait, considering the options, a triplet would be the simplest. Alternatively, a triplet of triplets might occur if each H is coupled with two sets of two different Hs.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to a diketone with a CH2 group in between. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the Hs on the central CH2 would each be split by the two adjacent CH2 groups. Each H would have two neighboring Hs on each side, leading to a triplet from each adjacent group. But in reality, each H would be coupled with four Hs (two on each adjacent CH2), but that's not possible because each H can only couple with adjacent Hs on adjacent carbons.

Wait, no, each H on a CH2 group can only couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So, for example, in a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, the central CH2's Hs would each see two Hs from the next CH2 group, leading to a triplet. But if the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps the coupling is only with one adjacent group, resulting in a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is longer, like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, making the middle CH2 group have coupling with two CH2 groups on either side. Each H on the middle CH2 would then see two Hs from each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet from each, but that would result in a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but that's a lot of splitting. Alternatively, maybe the Hs are in a situation where each is coupled to two different sets of Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, taking the example of CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-..., the Hs on the CH2 next to the CO would be a triplet due to coupling with the next CH2. If that next CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group, then the first Hs would see two Hs from each, leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a CH2 that's between two carbonyl groups, leading to each H being coupled with two Hs on each side, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a CH2 that's between a carbonyl and an oxygen-containing group, leading to coupling with more Hs.

I'm not entirely confident, but considering the options, the most plausible coupling pattern for the most deshielded H (on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2 group) would be a triplet of triplets, as each H would be coupled with two Hs from each adjacent group. Alternatively, it could be a triplet.

Wait, but the options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

Hmm. Another approach: the most deshielded H is likely to be on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-O-R. Then, the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split by the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet. Additionally, if the adjacent CH2 is split by another group, perhaps the first CH2's Hs would have a more complex pattern.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to be precise. However, based on the information, I think the most deshielded H would be in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, which is itself adjacent to another CH2 group. This would result in each H coupling with two Hs on the adjacent group, giving a triplet. But if the adjacent group is itself coupled with another group, the splitting could become a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a terminal CH2, which would only couple with one adjacent group, leading to a triplet.

Given the options, I'm leaning towards the triplet of triplets, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: in ozonolysis, the cleavage of a double bond leads to the formation of carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 had a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, possibly forming a diketone. If the product 3 is a diketone, then the Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded. For example, in a structure like (CH2)2CO-CO(CH2)2, the central CH2 would be next to two carbonyl groups.

Wait, no. If product 2 was a dienone, like CH2=CH-CO-..., ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, for example, if product 2 was CH2-CH2-CO-..., ozonolysis would cleave between the CH2 groups, forming two ketones.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a cyclohexene derivative, and ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, leading to a structure with adjacent CH2 groups next to carbonyls.

In such a case, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would have Hs that are deshielded and split by adjacent groups.

If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O, then the CH2 groups in the middle would each have two neighboring CH2 groups. Each H on the middle CH2 would see two Hs from each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet from each. But since each H is coupled with two different sets (each adjacent CH2), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-O, the middle CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, considering this, the coupling pattern would likely be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C likely results in a double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules), forming a ketone. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, and the ¹H NMR data supports this interpretation. The singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H) corresponds to a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, consistent with a ketone structure.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**  
   Product 1 (the ketone) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates a reaction involving the ketone, such as forming an enol or enabling a rearrangement. However, the exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis and Workup**  
   Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups. If product 2 contains a double bond, ozonolysis would produce a diketone or similar structure. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling Pattern Analysis**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group and part of a CH₂ group. This CH₂ group is likely flanked by two other CH₂ groups. Each hydrogen on this CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on each adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a splitting pattern of a triplet of triplets.

Given the coupling interactions and the structural context, the most plausible coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen is **triplet of triplets**.
