Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of a compound based on its NMR data and then determine the product after a series of reactions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The molecular formula given is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, substituting the numbers: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. That's (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That usually corresponds to rings and double bonds. Five could be a benzene ring (which has three double bonds and one ring, so four degrees) plus another double bond or ring. Or maybe another ring and a double bond. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring and a double bond plus a ring elsewhere, but let's see.

Looking at the NMR data: 

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet integrating for 1 proton. High chemical shift, possibly an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually come around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but here it's a triplet. Wait, but maybe it's something else. Alternatively, could it be an acidic proton like from a carbonyl group or an enol? Or perhaps an aldehyde that's coupling with two neighboring protons, making it a triplet. Hmm.

6.98 ppm (d, 2H) – aromatic protons, probably in a para-substituted benzene ring. Because if it's a doublet, maybe it's in a para position. Because in para substitution, each proton would have only one neighboring proton, but wait, no, that's meta. Wait, no: for a para-substituted benzene, the protons are actually equivalent and each has two adjacent protons but in a certain coupling scenario. Wait, maybe they're in a di-substituted ring, perhaps with coupling across the ring.

Wait, no, if it's a para-substituted benzene, each proton is next to two others, but maybe they're part of a meta coupling. Alternatively, maybe the doublet comes from a substituted benzene where each proton is coupled with one other. Like in the case of a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene, but that's more complex.

Wait, the next peak
