Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, what's Lithium with 3 neutrons? Oh right, Lithium typically has 3 protons (since Li is element 3). If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons +3 neutrons=6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, which I think is a charged particle, probably a singly charged ion since heavy ions in colliders are often like that. Or wait, maybe it's fully stripped? Not sure, but perhaps I can assume it's a bare nucleus, so charge Z=3, but maybe that doesn't matter for calculating the energy. Wait, no, energy in particle accelerators is usually given per nucleon or per particle, but here we're talking about the nucleus itself.

So the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is 0.96c, so I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus. The formula I remember is the total energy E = gamma * m0c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is equal to 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v is 0.96c, right?

Let me plug that in. First, calculate gamma. So v = 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². Let's compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 *0.96. Let me think. 0.9^2 is 0.81, 0.06^2 is 0.0036, and the cross terms are 2*0.9*0.06=0.108. So 0.81 + 0.108 + 0.0036 = 0.9216. So v squared is 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784, right. So yes, gamma is 1 / 0.28. 1 divided by 0.28 is the same as 100/28, which is approximately 3.57142857. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy m0c² for the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, what is the mass of Li-6? The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.014 atomic mass units (u). Let me check in my memory. Lithium-6 has an atomic mass around 6.014 u. So m0 = 6.014 u. But I need to convert that to GeV/c². Because energy is in GeV, and I know that 1 u is approximately 0.9315 GeV/c². So m0c² would be 6.014 u * 0.9315 GeV/u ≈ ?

Calculating that: 6 * 0.9315 is 5.589 GeV. 0.014 * 0.9315 is about 0.013041 GeV. So adding them gives approximately 5.589 + 0.013041 = 5.602041 GeV. So m0c² ≈ 5.602 GeV.

Wait
