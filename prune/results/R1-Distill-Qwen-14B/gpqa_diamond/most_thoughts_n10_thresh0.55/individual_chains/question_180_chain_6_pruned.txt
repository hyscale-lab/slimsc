Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and the options are given.

Wait, right. The particles are identical and have charge 2e. So each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge. The elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, so each charge here is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, the setup: 12 charges are at 2 meters from point P, and one is fixed at P. So the 13th is at P, and the others are all at 2m away. I'm trying to visualize this. So the system has a central charge at P, and 12 others arranged symmetrically around it at a radius of 2 meters.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Wait, I think this is about the electric potential energy of the configuration. Since the system is isolated, the potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But wait, how do we calculate the potential energy for each pair? The formula for the electric potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2)
