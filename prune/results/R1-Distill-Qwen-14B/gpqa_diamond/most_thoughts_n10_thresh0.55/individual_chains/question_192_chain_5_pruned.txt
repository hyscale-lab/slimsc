Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The setup is a bit tricky. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and since r is less than R, it's entirely inside the conductor. 

Now, they've placed a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. I need to find the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l is greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. 

Hmm, okay. I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, but there's a charge inside the cavity, I think the charges inside the conductor will redistribute. 

Wait, but wait! The conductor was initially uncharged, so when you place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's charges will adjust. Specifically, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) will have an induced charge opposite to q. Because the conductor was neutral, the outer surface will then have a charge equal in magnitude to q but positive, right?

So, the inner surface of the cavity has -q, and the outer surface of the conductor has +q. But wait, no, because the conductor was uncharged. Oh wait, actually, the conductor's total charge is zero. So when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q because the conductor as a whole is neutral. Wait, no, because the conductor's total charge is zero, the sum of inner and outer surface charges must be zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q, sum is zero. No, wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral overall. So the inner surface will have -q induced, and the outer surface must have +q, because the conductor's total charge is zero. Wait, no, that can't be. Because the conductor was neutral, so the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance. Because the conductor's
