Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to work through this.

The question says: Two astronauts, one has mass 2m and the other 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Regular addition would be wrong because of the speed limit c. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity uses the Lorentz transformation. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Since both are moving in the same direction, I think v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c.

So plugging in, v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator: (0.3c²)/(c²) is 0.3, so denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel is (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Oh that's about 0.14c when rounded. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut's total energy is their rest energy plus kinetic, but wait, I think in relativity, the total energy is just the rest mass energy multiplied by gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's compute each gamma. For the first astronaut, v=0.6c. Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Similarly, the second astronaut's gamma: v=0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Wait, but the masses are 2m and 3m. So their energies would be E1 = gamma1 * m1 c² and E2 = gamma2 * m2 c².

So E1 = 1.25 * (2m) c² = 2.5 m c².

E2 = 1.1547 * (3m) c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Adding those together: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². That's close to 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel is 0.14c and E is 5.96 mc². So that should be the correct choice.

Wait, let me double-check the relative velocity calculation. V_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.1428... which is about 0.14c. Correct.

So the first part is 0.14c, and the energy adds up to approximately 5.96 mc². So option C is the correct one.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The total relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\). For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.5^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

Combining the results, the relative speed is \(0.14c\) and the total energy is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
