Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the listed theories never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, right, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. So the idea is to make the integrals finite by introducing a cutoff, say a maximum momentum scale, and then later remove it by taking the limit. But some theories don't need this because their calculations are already finite, or maybe because they're non-perturbative?

Let me go through each option. 

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. It deals with particles as vibrations of strings. String theories, like Type I, II, etc., are background-dependent but have a concept called the "string scale." At high energies (or equivalently, short distances), string theory is supposed to be perturbatively finite. Wait, because string theory incorporates higher-order corrections and maybe doesn't have the same kind of divergences as point particle theories. Or does it? Or perhaps because strings have a minimum size, so the cutoff isn't needed. Or maybe in string theory, the divergences are handled by the theory itself without needing an explicit regularization scheme. So maybe string theory doesn't require regularization because it's finite? Or maybe it's because of the way it's formulated, like in terms of a sum over all topologies, and the perturbative expansion is different.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to SU(3). It involves things like asymptotic freedom, where the force between quarks becomes weaker at high energies. But wait, QCD calculations, especially perturbative ones, require renormalization. For example, in loop calculations, you get divergences. So you need to use techniques like dimensional regularization or Pauli-Villars regularization. So QCD does require regularization, which means it's not the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, dealing with electrons and photons. I remember that QED is a renormalizable
