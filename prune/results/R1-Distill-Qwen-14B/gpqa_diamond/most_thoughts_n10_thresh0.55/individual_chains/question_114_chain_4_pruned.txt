Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let me think through this step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, (CH3)2CO) and NaCN in the presence of reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, but ketones typically don't react directly with NaCN. So maybe it's under some specific conditions. Oh, right! I think when a ketone reacts with a cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst, it undergoes a substitution. Wait, no, more accurately, it's the addition of the cyanide. Let me recall: The reaction of ketones with HCN is a nucleophilic addition, producing a cyanohydrin. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, so maybe this is a similar reaction. So butan-2-one plus NaCN and H3O+? Or perhaps another acid.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So, the ketone group (C=O) is replaced by a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. That makes sense for a cyanohydrin formation. So the general reaction is ketone + HCN â†’ cyanohydrin. But in this
