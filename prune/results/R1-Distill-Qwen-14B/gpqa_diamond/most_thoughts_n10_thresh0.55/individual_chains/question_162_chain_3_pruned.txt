Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²)(dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2D metric in some coordinates. I remember that metrics can describe different geometries, like flat or curved spaces.

So, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere... oh right, that's like a surface of constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere isn't something I remember exactly, but maybe I can figure it out from the metric.

Wait, the metric given is in terms of x and y, so perhaps it's in polar coordinates? Because x² + y² = r², which makes me think of polar coordinates. Let me see, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which would be 4 - r² in polar. So the metric becomes (32)/(4 - r²) dr² + (32)/(4 - r²) r² dθ². Because dx² + dy² in polar is dr² + r² dθ².

So putting it together, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, or maybe it's written in a way that the (dx² + dy²) is scaled by that factor. So in terms of r, the metric is isotropic, meaning it's the same in all directions. That might suggest it's a surface of revolution, and maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in 3D space.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudospheres have a specific geometry. The standard pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) has a metric with a specific form. Let me recall: the metric for a pseudosphere in polar coordinates is usually something like ds² = dr² + (a² / cosh(r/a))² dθ² or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's expressed in terms of another function, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Gaussian curvature. The area of a surface can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which relates the integral of Gaussian curvature to the Euler characteristic. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Alternatively, the area can be calculated by integrating the area element over the surface.
