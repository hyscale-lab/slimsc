Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC accelerates heavy ions to relativistic speeds. 

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and typically 4 neutrons (like in Li-7). But if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

The next thing I need to do is find the energy of the ion. Since it's a relativistic problem, I'll probably need to use the relativistic energy equations. The ion is moving at 0.96c, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light, so relativistic effects are definitely in play.

I think the total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I should calculate gamma for v=0.96c.

Let me compute that. v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2. Let me calculate 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmmm, what's sqrt(0.0784)? I think sqrt(0.09) is 0.3, so sqrt(0.0784) must be a bit less. Let me compute it. 0.28 squared is 0.0784? Let's check: 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784 exactly. Oh, right, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. 

So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, 1 divided by 0.28 is the same as 100 divided by 28, which is 3.571428... So gamma is approximately 3.57143.

Now, the rest mass energy (m0c²) is the mass of the nucleus multiplied by c squared. The nucleus is Li-6. I need the mass of Li-6. Wait, but I don't remember the exact mass. Oh wait, perhaps I can find the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0152 grams per mole, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the mass can be calculated using the atomic number and the mass of a nucleon.

Wait, another approach. The mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the sum of protons and neutrons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for a neutron. So for Li-6, which
