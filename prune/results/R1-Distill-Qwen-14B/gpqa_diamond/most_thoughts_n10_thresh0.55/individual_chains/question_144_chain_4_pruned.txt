Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and the velocity. Oh right, the formula for the mean decay length is L = γ * c * τ * v, where γ is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, τ is the proper lifetime, and v is the velocity.

Wait, but wait. No, maybe I should think about the relation between the width and the lifetime. Oh yes, the uncertainty principle comes into play here. The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by τ = ħ / Γ, right? Because the width is the energy uncertainty, and the lifetime is the inverse of that.

Wait, but wait. I have to be careful with units. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s or something like that. Let me get the constants right.

First, let's recall the formula for the mean decay distance. The mean proper lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the lifetime as measured in the lab frame is Lorentz gamma multiplied by τ, because moving particles experience time dilation. So τ_lab = γ * τ.

But wait, the production energy. The production energy E is probably the total energy of the meson. So the kinetic energy plus the rest mass. Or wait, actually, the production energy E is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV, so the kinetic energy would be E - m_X c², but in units where c=1, it's E - m_X = 8 - 1.2 = 6.8 GeV.

Wait, but for the decay length, I think I need the velocity, which comes from the energy and mass. So the total energy is E = γ m c². So γ is E/(m c²). But since we're probably using units where c=1, it's E/(m). Let me check: E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So γ would be E/(m c²) → 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8/1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

So γ is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So about 6.6667.

Then the velocity v can be found from γ. The relation between γ and velocity is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since we're working in natural units (c=1), v = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let me compute that.

So v = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) → sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) )? Wait, let me compute γ first. 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666..., so 6.6667 is approximately 6.6667.

So
