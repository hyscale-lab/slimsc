Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, each involving a Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and major products for each, then match them with the options provided.

Let's start with the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. The product is labeled A.

Wait, I remember that the Michael addition is a reaction where a nucleophile (enolate) attacks an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile source because it can form an enolate. The other reactant is the alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

So, the setup is that the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. Since the acrylate is (E)-configured, the substituents are on opposite sides, but I'm not sure if that affects the product structure much.

In the Michael addition, the enolate (from the malonate) will add to the beta carbon of the acrylate. The malonate is a diethyl ester, so when it forms the enolate, it's a strong nucleophile. The product would have the malonate part attached to the acrylate.

Wait, but wait. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CHCH2COOEt? No, wait, dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. When it forms the enolate, the base (like NaOEt) deprotonates the alpha hydrogen to form the enolate. Then, this enolate attacks the beta position of the acrylate.

The acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the E configuration. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is actually CH2-C-(p-tolyl)=CH2? Or is it CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Hmm, no. Wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=C(CO-OCH3)-p-tolyl? Or perhaps it's CH2-CH2, wait no. Let me think again. The correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, that doesn't account for the p-tolyl. Oh wait, wait. The substituents on the double bond are at the 3 and 4 positions, I think. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOR? No, maybe it's the substituent is on the alpha carbon. Maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. Wait, wait. Let me get this
