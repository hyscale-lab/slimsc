Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, no, wait, more accurately, I think the formula is plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. Because distance d = 1 / plx. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

The problem says the number of stars (N) varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. But I need to find how N changes with distance. So I should probably express everything in terms of distance r instead of parallax.

Since parallax plx is 1/d, where d is the distance. So plx = 1/d. Therefore, 1/plx = d. Let me substitute that into the equation. N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. 

Wait, 1/( (1/d) )^5 is the same as d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5), so 1 over that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, so it's the number per unit distance. Hmm, wait, maybe I need to think about this as the number density or something.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The original relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx =1/d, so 1/plx = d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax. So for a given region, maybe the number of stars within a certain volume?

Wait, no. Let's think again. The problem says, in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, perhaps they are talking about the number of stars per unit volume or something, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider that the number of stars is inversely proportional to plx^
