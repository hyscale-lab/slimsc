Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1, 2, 3, 4 with four choices.

Wait, let me think. The symmetries mentioned are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. I know that a lot of theories have to respect certain symmetries. For example, Lorentz symmetry is crucial because it's the foundation of relativity. So in SMEFT, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry because otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense in different inertial frames. So symmetry 1 is definitely a must.

Then there's Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, but isn't Poincare symmetry a bigger symmetry group that includes both Lorentz transformations and translations? If the theory respects Lorentz symmetry, does it automatically respect Poincare? I think in a theory that's Lorentz-invariant, it's also Poincare-invariant because the fields can be moved around without issues. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, then Poincare should be automatically satisfied. So symmetry 2 is also a must. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Now, CP symmetry. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. But I remember that in the Standard Model, CP symmetry is not exactly respected because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. But in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP? I think the SMEFT operators don't necessarily have to conserve CP. Because sometimes you can have operators that change CP. So maybe CP symmetry isn't a requirement. Wait, but I should think about whether all operators must respect it. Alternatively, perhaps some operators respect it and others don't. So symmetry 3, CP, might not be a must.

Then there's CPT symmetry. I know that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. Every interaction that respects the basic principles must conserve CPT. So CPT symmetry is a big one. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So symmetry 4 is a must.

Putting it all together: which symmetries must all operators respect? That would be Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait
