Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage with multiple rings. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 of this structure.

First step: Heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. I think KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's causing an elimination reaction. Dehydrohalogenation perhaps? But wait, with two bromine atoms, maybe an E2 mechanism? Alternatively, could it be a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene?

The product is a light yellow solid, and the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That region is typical for carbonyl groups, maybe a ketone or an ester. The ¹H NMR data is given. Let's look at that.

The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which might be a CH₂ group next to an electronegative atom or part of an ether or something. Then, 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) suggests a lot of equivalent CH₂ groups, maybe in a cyclohexane-like structure or part of a bridged system. The 1.94 ppm (2H) is probably another CH₂ group, maybe more shielded.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps the DBU (dibromoadamantane) under basic conditions is undergoing elimination to form a ketone. So, when two adjacent bromines are eliminated, maybe forming a ketone bridge. Wait, but how does that happen?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH could cause the elimination of HBr twice, leading to the formation of a ketone. Because when two adjacent Brs are eliminated, each elimination would remove HBr, but if the structure allows, maybe it forms a bridge with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, KOH could cause a double elimination, perhaps leading to the formation of a diketone? Or maybe each Br is eliminated, forming an alkene, but then if two eliminations happen, maybe more rings are formed
