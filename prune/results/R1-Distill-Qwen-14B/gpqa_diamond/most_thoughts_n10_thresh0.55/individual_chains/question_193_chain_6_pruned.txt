Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it. Hmm. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? Because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Like, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Oh wait, no, more accurately, parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, if a star is at distance d (in parsecs), plx = 1/d.

So, the problem is about how the number of stars changes with distance. The question is about the number per unit range of distance. So, maybe they're asking about the number density as a function of distance.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx would be d. So substituting, N ∝ d^5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, because 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So, as distance d increases, the number of stars increases like d^5. But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you look further away, you should see fewer stars in a unit volume, right? Because stars are spread out more.

Wait, maybe I
