Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the product of a reaction involving Compound X. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which I think is related to a phosphorylation or maybe a substitution reaction. Hmm, wait, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the Clemmensen reduction, but wait, no, that's for ketones to alkanes. Or maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, another thought: when alcohols react with HI and red phosphorus, it's for the substitution of the hydroxyl group with iodine. But wait, maybe that's when you have an alcohol. Alternatively, if it's an ester or a carboxylic acid, maybe it's a hydrolysis. I'm a bit confused here, so I need to figure out first what Compound X is.

Looking at the IR data: strong absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ suggests either an -OH group or maybe an -NH stretch, but without the NMR data I'm not sure. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, ester, aldehyde, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so there's probably an aromatic ring involved.

Now the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is quite upfield for a proton. Wait, no, wait—10.5 ppm is actually a downfield shift, so that's probably an -OH proton. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the integration is 1H. So an -OH group is likely. Alternatively, an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, the 1720 cm⁻¹ in IR could be a carboxylic acid (but their O-H is usually broader and maybe a bit higher). Alternatively, it's an ester, because esters have C=O around 1720-1740. Wait, but in that case, the NMR would have an ester group.

Looking at the other NMR signals: at 8.0 ppm,
