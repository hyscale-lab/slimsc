Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, okay, the problem says we have a large ensemble of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. But when they measured the positions, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So, I need to find the value of 'a'. 

Wait, right, the wave function must be normalized because probabilities must add up to 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. But wait, the wave function given here is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the absolute square would be the square of the magnitude of this complex number.

Let me break that down. The wave function ψ(x) is a complex function: ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared |ψ(x)|² is [ (a / sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because when you have a complex number (a + ib), the square is a² + b². 

Wait, actually, I think I should compute |ψ(x)|² correctly. ψ(x) is a complex number where the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So, the modulus squared is (Real part)^2 + (Im
