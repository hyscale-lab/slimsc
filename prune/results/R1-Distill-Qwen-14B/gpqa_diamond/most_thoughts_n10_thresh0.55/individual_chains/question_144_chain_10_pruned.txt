Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. They want to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are the production energy E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X=320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different distances in meters.

I remember that when a particle is produced, it doesn't live forever. It decays after some time. The mean decay time, or the lifetime, is related to the particle's width. Oh wait, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time are inversely related. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but I think for particles, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. Or wait, maybe Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so τ is ħ/(Γ). 

So to find the mean lifetime τ, I can use τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units are a bit tricky here. I'll need to make sure everything is in the right units.

Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance would be the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, the particle is a meson, which I think is a boson made of a quark and antiquark. So, its speed depends on its energy and mass. But maybe since it's produced with a certain energy, I can consider its velocity as roughly the speed of light? Or perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, the production energy is given as 8 GeV. The mass of the meson is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E is 8 GeV, which is much larger than the rest mass. So the meson is moving relativistically. So I can approximate its speed as the speed of light, v ≈ c. But let me think again. The energy E is the total energy, so E = γ m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). But since E is in GeV and m_X is 1.2 GeV, gamma would be 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667. 

But wait, the exact value of gamma isn't needed if we're assuming v ≈ c, because the speed is so close to c that it's approximately c. So for the decay length, L ≈ v * τ. Since v ≈ c, L ≈ c * τ.

So steps:

1. Calculate the mean lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Calculate the decay distance L = v * τ ≈ c * τ.

But I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let's express everything in SI units.

First, let's compute Γ in GeV. Oh wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, more precisely, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Now, ħ (h-bar) is a constant. Its value is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, yes
