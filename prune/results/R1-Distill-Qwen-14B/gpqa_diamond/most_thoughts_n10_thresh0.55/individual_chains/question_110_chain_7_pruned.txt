Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various parameters: RA, DEC, absolute or apparent V magnitude, distance, and some have extinction (E(B-V)). The task is to determine which of these stars can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. 

From the setup, I remember that ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. HIRES at Keck can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. Oh wait, wait. Let me make sure. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO" and "brighter than 16 V mag with HIRES." So, I think that means ESPRESSO can see stars up to, but not including, 17 mag. So apparent V mag less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO, and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES? Or does it mean they can see stars brighter than 17 (which would be lower numbers since lower magnitudes are brighter). Hmm, I think the wording is such that if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than 17, it can be observed. So, the limit is above (brighter) 17 for ESPRESSO and above 16 for HIRES. So, meaning for a star to be observed by both, its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than 17 and brighter than 16. Wait, that can't be. Because 17 is fainter than 16. So, if a star is brighter than 17, that's a lower number. Wait, no. Wait, magnitudes are tricky. Lower magnitude means brighter. So, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So, for a star to be observable by both, it must have apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 (so V <17) and also brighter than 16 (so V <16). Wait, but that would mean only V <16. Because if a star has V=15, it's brighter than both 16 and 17. So, for a star to be observable by both, it must have apparent V less than 16 mag. Because if it's 16.5, that's fainter than 16, so HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. But for both, the star must be brighter than both 17 and 16, which would be V <16. Because if a star is, say, V=15, then both can see it. But if it's V=16.5, ESPRESSO can still see it (since 16.5 <17 is false, wait no: The question says 'brighter than 17 mag can be observed' for ESPRESSO. So, brighter than 17 is same as V <17. Because a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17, so it's included. For HIRES, stars with V <16. So, for a star to be detected by both, it must have apparent V <16 mag. So, any star with V <16 can be seen by both. 

Wait, no. Let me rephrase. The ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So, stars with V <17 can be observed. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V <16. So, for both, the star must be brighter than 17 and 16, which is V <16. So, only stars with V <16 can be observed by both. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17, which is V <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, which is V <16. So, to be detected by both, the star must have V <16 (since it's the stricter condition). So, any star that has an apparent V mag less than 16 can be seen by both. If the apparent mag is between 16 and 17, it can only be seen by ESPRESSO. 

Wait, but the options are about which stars can be detected by both. So, I need to compute the apparent V mag for each star, considering any extinction (dust reddening), and then see if it's <16 (for both) or at least <17 for ESPRESSO and <16 for HIRES.

Wait, but some stars are given their absolute magnitude and distance, so I need to compute apparent V. Others are given apparent V, but maybe have extinction (E(B-V)), which affects the observed apparent magnitude.

Wait, the apparent magnitude is the observed magnitude, right?
