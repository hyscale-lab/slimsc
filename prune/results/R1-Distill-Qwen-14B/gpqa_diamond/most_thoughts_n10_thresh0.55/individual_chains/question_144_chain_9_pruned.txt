Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about meson resonance and the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics here.

The problem gives me some data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. So, I'm guessing I need to calculate the average distance the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, what's the approach here. Mean decay distance... Oh right, I think it has to do with the particle's lifetime. The mean decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime, right? But how do I find the lifetime from the given parameters?

I remember that the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Oh wait, the relation is Γ = ħ / τ, since Γ is the energy width and τ is the lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the units might matter here. Because ħ has units of energy·time, so when you divide by Γ (energy), you get time.

Yes, that makes sense. So the lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, units again. I need to make sure everything is in standard units. Let's see: ħ is about 6.
