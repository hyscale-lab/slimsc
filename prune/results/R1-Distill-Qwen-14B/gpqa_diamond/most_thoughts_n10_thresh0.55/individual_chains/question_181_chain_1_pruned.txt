Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this neutrino flux question, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But let's see what I can figure out.

The question is about the Sun's neutrino production. So, I remember that the Sun's energy comes mostly from the proton-proton chain, right? And that the pp-III branch is one of the steps in that process. The question says that this branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Hmm, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, because that's the time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to the Earth. So whatever changes happen in the Sun's core will only affect us now, since the neutrinos take that time to reach us.

Wait, the question is asking about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So before the pp-III branch stopped, what was the flux in these bands, and how does stopping it affect them?

I think I need to recall what the pp-III branch does. From what I remember, the proton-proton chain has a few branches. The main one is the pp-I branch where two protons fuse into deuterium, then another proton fuses to form helium-3. But when the temperature is higher, the pp-II branch becomes active, and at even higher temperatures, the pp-III branch. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves more steps. The pp-III process produces boron-8, I think.

So, the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the other branches. Because when a boron-8 nucleus (which is B-8) undergoes beta decay, it emits a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is higher because B-8 has a higher mass and the decay process releases more energy.

So, before the pp-III branch stopped, the neutrinos from that process contributed to the higher-energy bands. If pp-III stops, those high-energy neutrinos won't be produced anymore.

Wait, but how does this affect the flux in the two bands? Let's think about the neutrino energy distribution. The pp-III neutrinos are in the higher energy range. So if pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would decrease a lot. But what about band 1 (700-800 keV)? Those are lower than the pp-III neutrinos, so maybe they come from other processes, like the pp-I or pp-II branches.

Wait, no, wait. The pp-I and pp-II branches produce lower-energy neutrinos, right? Because they involve lighter particles. So before the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos from that branch were contributing to the higher energy bands. If pp-III stops, those high-energy neutrinos stop coming. So the flux in band 2 (which is higher energy) would drop significantly, but band 1 (lower energy) wouldn't be as affected because those neutrinos are from other processes which are still running.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2. So if band 2's flux drops, the ratio (band1/band2) would go up, right?

Let me think about the usual solar neutrino spectrum
