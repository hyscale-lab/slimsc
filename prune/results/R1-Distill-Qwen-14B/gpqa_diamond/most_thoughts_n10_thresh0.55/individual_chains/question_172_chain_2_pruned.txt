Okay, I'm trying to figure out this problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, so the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so Boltzmann distribution applies here.

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the population of energy levels in atoms depends on temperature. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is n2/n1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where E2 is higher than E1, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

In this problem, star_1 has twice as many excited iron atoms as star_2. So, for star_1, n1_2/n1_1 = 2, and for star_2, n2_2/n2_1 = something. Wait, no, actually, the problem says the excitation level is twice. So maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is different between the two stars.

Wait, let me think. Let me define variables. Letâ€™s say for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (n2) to the ground state (n1) is given. So for star 1, n2_1/n1_1 = 2. For star_2, n2_2/n1_2 = x, which we don't know yet. But we need to relate the temperatures T1 and T2.

But wait, the problem says that the energy difference is the same for both stars, right? Because the energy difference is a property of the iron atom, not the star. So E = 1.38e-23 J for both.

The Boltzmann equation for each star would be:

For star_1: (n2_1)/(n1_1) = exp( -E/(k T1) )

And for star_2: (n2_2)/(n1_2) = exp( -E/(k T2) )

But wait, the question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio n2_1/n1_1 is twice the ratio in star_2? Or maybe n2_1 is twice n2_2, but that might not make sense because the number could
