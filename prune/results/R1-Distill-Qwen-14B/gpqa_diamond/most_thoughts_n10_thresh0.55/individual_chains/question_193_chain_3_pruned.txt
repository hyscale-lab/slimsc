Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. And we need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. The options are from A to D, each a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star against the background, and the formula I remember is that the distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds). So plx = 1/d, meaning d = 1/plx. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

The number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me write that down. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we get 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, so N increases with the fifth power of distance? But wait, that doesn't sound right. Because as you go further away, the number of stars should decrease, right? Because stars are fainter and fewer in a given area of the sky. Wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait no, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So if plx increases, parallax is bigger (because plx is in arcseconds; higher plx means closer star). Wait, no, wait. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So higher plx means closer star. So for a fixed region of the sky, the number of stars with higher parallax (closer) would be more, because more stars are nearby.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So when distance increases, what happens to the number of stars?

Let me think again. N ∝ 1/plx^5. But plx = 1/d. So substituting, N ∝ d^5. That suggests that N increases as d^5. But that seems odd because as you go further, you'd expect fewer stars in a given area because stars are spread out more. Oh wait, perhaps this is
