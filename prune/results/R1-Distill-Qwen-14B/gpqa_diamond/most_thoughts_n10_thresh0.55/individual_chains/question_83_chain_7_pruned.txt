Okay, so I need to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction.

The problem says we diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, let me think about the initial dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution can be calculated using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. 

Wait, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 → 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with NaOH. At 25% titration, only 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. And at equivalence, all of it has reacted.

First, let's find the moles involved. The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Volume is 40 cm³, so 0.04 L. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

When titrated with NaOH, each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid. So the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will be equal to moles of acetic acid. So moles NaOH = 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed at equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³. Wait, but that's the equivalence volume. But the question isn't about that; it's about pH at 25% titration and equivalence.

So for 25% titration: 25% of 0.001 mol is 0.00025 mol of NaOH added. So 0.00025 mol of NaOH reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So what's the situation in the solution? We have a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

First, calculate pKa. The Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267-5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the pKa is -log10(Ka). So 1.85e-5 is 1.85 ×10^-5. Log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 → -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now,
