Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think it through.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if something happens in the Sun's core, we on Earth would see the effects after about that time. But neutrinos, being almost massless and thus moving almost at the speed of light, would arrive almost instantly. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, we would have noticed the change in neutrino flux almost right away, but the light from the Sun would still be showing the old conditions for another 8.5 minutes. But I think the question is more about the neutrino flux change due to the pp-III branch stopping.

Now, the question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: band 1 is 700-800 keV, band 2 is 800-900 keV. So we need to find flux(band1)/flux(band2) after the pp-III branch stops.

I remember that the pp chain is the primary source of energy in the Sun, right? The pp-I branch leads to the pp-II, then the pp-III, each involving higher energy reactions. The pp-III branch involves reactions that produce high-energy neutrinos, particularly the Beryllium-7 capturing a proton to form Boron-8, which then decays into Lithium-8 and emits a neutrino. Oh wait, wait, the main neutrinos from the Sun are from the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle, but the dominant neutrinos come from the pp chain, specifically the Beryllium decay.

Wait, the solar neutrinos are mainly from the pp chain, particularly the reaction where Be-7 captures a proton to become Boron-8, which then emits a neutrino as it decays into Lithium-8. So the neutrinos from that process have a certain energy spectrum.

But if the pp-III branch stops, that means that the reaction that produces these higher energy neutrinos is no longer happening. So the flux of these higher energy neutrinos would drop.

But wait, the question is about the ratio between two bands. So what determines the energy of the neutrinos? The energy
