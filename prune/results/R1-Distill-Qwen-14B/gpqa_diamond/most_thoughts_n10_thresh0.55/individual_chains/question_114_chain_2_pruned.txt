Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I need to pick the correct options from A to D. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll focus on the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let me write out the structures to visualize it better.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The formula would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, perhaps it's more like (CH2CH2) something. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of reactions.

The reaction is between a ketone (butan-2-one) and NaCN. Oh, wait, NaCN is a nucleophile. In the presence of an acid, perhaps. So, this is likely a nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl.

In the first reaction, the ketone reacts with cyanide ion (CN-) in the presence of a reagent A. The product has a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So, that suggests a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by CN and OH.

Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the product structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Hmm, maybe the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but the product's IUPAC name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That would imply the structure is CH2(C(CH
