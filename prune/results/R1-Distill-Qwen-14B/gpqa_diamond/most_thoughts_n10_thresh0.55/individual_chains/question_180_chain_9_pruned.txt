Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit unsure about how to approach it, but let's try to break it down. Alright, let's read the question again.

We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. 12 of these are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm. So I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because when you have multiple charges, the system's energy is based on their interactions.

Wait, so the setup is that one charge is fixed at point P, and the others are at a distance of 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from P, which is where the 13th charge is located.

So, the system consists of 13 charges, each with charge 2e. So each charge is 2 times the elementary charge. The elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, the energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But wait, considering that the charges are identical and all repel each other, the potential energy would be positive since bringing them closer would require work.

But since the system is isolated, the energy is just the total potential energy. So how to calculate this.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed. So the 12 charges around are all at 2 meters from P, so each of them is at 2m from the fixed charge. So perhaps the potential energy is the sum of the energy between each of the 12 and the fixed one, plus the energy between each pair of the 12.

Wait, that's a good point. Because each of the 12 charges is at a fixed distance from P, but what about their mutual distances? If they're all constrained to stay at 2m from P, their mutual distances would be determined by their positions on the sphere of radius 2m around P. But if the problem considers them to be fixed, perhaps their mutual distances are not something we have to compute, but maybe the problem is simplified.

Alternatively, maybe the question is only considering the potential energy between the fixed
