Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator, specifically the Y-component. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The matrix is given, right? The first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the matrix S is given as that, and A_y is c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π), so A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

So, first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Because the question is about which statement is correct regarding the calculation.

Let me think about the process. To find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

So first, what is matrix Ay? Since S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], multiplying by c gives Ay = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]].

Wait, let's compute that. So each element multiplied by c.

So Ay is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out:

Ay = [ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
        [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

Hmm, I need to find the eigenvalues a for which det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ [ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

So determinant = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, what's (-i)(i)? Let me compute that. i times i is -1, but here it's (-i) times i. So (-i)*i = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So that term becomes positive.

So determinant = a² - [ (1) * (h²/(4π)^2) ) ] = a² - (h²)/(16π²).

Setting determinant to zero: a² = h²/(16π²) → a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, that's the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π).

Wait, but the question is about the calculation process. Let me look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is ±2πh, and real parts are ±h/(4π). Wait, but the eigenvalues are real numbers because angular momentum operators have real eigenvalues when measured, right? Because observables must have real eigenvalues. So if A_y has eigenvalues ±h/(4π), which are real. So the imaginary parts would be zero. So option A's statement about imaginary parts is wrong. So A is incorrect.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. But our calculation shows eigenvalues
