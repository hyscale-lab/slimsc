Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to parse through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and expectation values for a given operator. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state of a particle is described by a vector in a Hilbert space, and when you have an operator, the eigenstates and eigenvalues correspond to the possible outcomes of measurements.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, so |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is the standard spin-up and spin-down states. So the state |alpha> is a linear combination of these.

First, I think I need to normalize this state. Because the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), I'll have to calculate the norm, which is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients. Let me compute that.

The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). So its square is 2. The magnitude of (2-i) is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5). So its square is 5. Adding these gives 2 +5=7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Next, the problem asks about the operator whose matrix elements Aij are given as hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Let me think. The standard Pauli matrices are 2x2. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], and so on. But what is the matrix A here? Since Aij is hbar/2 when i≠j, and zero otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So A would look like [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]].

Wait, that's actually the form of (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix has 1s in the off-diagonal. So A = (hbar/2) sigma_x. So the operator in question is (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

Now, the task is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of this operator. Since the operator is sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the spin states in the x-direction, let's call them |+x> and |-x>. The eigenvalues would be ±(hbar/2).

Wait, wait. Actually, sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when multiplied by hbar/2, the eigenvalues become (hbar/2) * (+1) and (hbar/2)*(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. So
