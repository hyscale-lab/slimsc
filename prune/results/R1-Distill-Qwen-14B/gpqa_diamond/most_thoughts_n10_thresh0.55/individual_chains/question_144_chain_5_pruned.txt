Okay, so I need to figure out the mean decay distance of this meson resonance X. Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to how long the particle lives before decaying. Since it's a resonance, it's probably a short-lived particle, so the decay distance should be really tiny.

Wait, the formula for the mean lifetime of a particle is tau equals h-bar over the total decay width Gamma. Right, because the width is related to the particle's lifetime. And then, once I have the lifetime, I can find how far it travels on average before decaying. Oh, right, the mean decay distance is the particle's speed multiplied by its lifetime. That makes sense because distance is velocity times time.

But wait, how do I get the speed? I think I can calculate the velocity using the energy and mass. Since the production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. Oh wait, but E_X is the energy of the meson when it's produced, so I can find the velocity from that.

Let me jot down the equations. The relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But I need to find v, so maybe I can rearrange that.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the relation between energy, mass, and momentum. The energy squared is (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. Solving for p, the momentum: p = sqrt( (E
