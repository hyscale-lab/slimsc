Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting their host stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

So the setup is that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because that would make it easier to detect. They know the planets' masses and orbital periods because they were detected via the radial velocity method. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

Wait, what's the formula for transit probability? I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula is something like P â‰ˆ (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_planet/(M_star)) )) ), but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, I think the probability is proportional to (R_p / a), where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis. Wait, but R_p is much smaller than R_star, so maybe the main factors are R_star and a.

Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a. But because the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate it as R_star / a. Oh wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The transit probability
