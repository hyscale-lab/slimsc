Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with coordination complexes and stability constants. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, what's a dithiocyanato complex? Oh right, that's probably the Co(SCN)_2 complex, maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^n+? Or wait, dithiocyanato could mean two SCN ligands. So for the blue complex, I think it's the tetrahedral or octahedral with two SCN- ions. But I'm not exactly sure about the structure, but maybe the exact structure isn't critical here since the problem gives the stability constants.

Stability constants (β) indicate the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β4 is 16, β3 is 63, which is higher, so the complex with three SCN- is more stable than the four? Wait, no, wait: β1 is for the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]^2+. Then β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^+, and so on. Or perhaps it's the other way around. I think the general form is [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n)+, so when n=1, it's [CoSCN]^+ ; n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0; n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^-; and n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But I'm not entirely sure about the charges. But maybe I don't need to get into that. Instead, I can think that each β corresponds to the formation of the complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the problem says "blue dithiocyanato". Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ions. So the complex we're interested in is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which would be the β2 complex. So β2 is 40.

But wait, is β2 the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0? I'm a bit confused because sometimes the stability constants can be sequential or cumulative. Oh wait, no, the given βs are likely the stability constants for each step. Like, β1 is for the first ligand, β2 is for the second, etc. Or wait, no, stability constants are usually given for the overall formation of the complex. Hmm, but sometimes they're given for each step. So perhaps β1 is for Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+, with β1=9. Then β2 would be for the next
