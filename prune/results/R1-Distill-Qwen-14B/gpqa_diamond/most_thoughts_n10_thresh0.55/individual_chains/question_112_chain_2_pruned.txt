Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

So the problem is about an electron in a state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The question is asking about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and also the average value of that operator.

First, let's get clear on the setup. The operator in question has matrix elements A_ij. If i is not equal to j, then A_ij is hbar/2. Otherwise, it's zero. Hmm, so for a 2x2 matrix, because we're dealing with spin states (up and down), the operator A would look like this:

A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

Wait, that's right because when i ≠ j, the element is hbar/2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal ones are hbar/2. So this is a 2x2 matrix.

I remember that such a matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (hbar/2) * X. Because each off-diagonal is hbar/2, and the diagonal is zero. So A = (hbar/2) σ_x.

Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of A. Because if A is proportional to σ_x, their eigenstates are the same. What are the eigenstates of σ_x? They are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction.

So the operator in question has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, and the problem is asking for the probabilities of measuring the electron in each of these states, given the state |alpha>.

Wait, but wait. The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So I need to normalize this to get the actual state vector.

Let's compute the normalization factor first. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The norm is the inner product of alpha with itself.

So the inner product is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i). Wait, no, wait. Wait, more accurately, the norm squared is |(1+i)|^2 + |(2 - i)|^2.

Because in a two-level system, the state is a linear combination of orthogonal states (|up> and |down> are orthogonal), so the norm is |c1|^2 + |c2|^2, where c1 and c2 are the coefficients.

So c1 is (1+i), c2 is (2 -i).

Compute |c1|^2: |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1 = 2.

|c2|^2: |2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) |up> + ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) |down>.

So now, the state is expressed in the computational basis (|up> and |down> are the z-basis states). But the operator A has eigenstates in the x-basis (|+x> and |-x>). So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these x-basis states.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A.

Wait, the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x. So let's find what those eigenstates are.

The eigenstates of σ_x are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)
