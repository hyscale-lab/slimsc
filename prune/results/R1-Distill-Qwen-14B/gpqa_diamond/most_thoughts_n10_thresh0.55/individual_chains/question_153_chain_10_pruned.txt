Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael reaction. Hmm, I remember the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. It's a conjugate addition, right? So the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each of which is a Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the reactants and products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Let me look at each part one by one.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The conditions are NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). 

I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a di-ester of malonic acid. The structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. It's a good donor because the enolate can form easily due to the two carbonyl groups stabilizing the negative charge.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be something like CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the acrylate part. Wait, no, actually, the correct structure would be: the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but wait, the substituent is at the 3 position, so maybe it's (E)-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the 3 position has a p-tolyl group. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 3. So it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)O-OCH3? No, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, the general structure of an acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon. So that would make it CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)O-OCH3? Wait, that can't be right because the carbonyl is at the end. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's (E)-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but that would be more like a propenoate. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-CH3, but wait, the position is 3. So perhaps it's a substituted acrylate where the p-tolyl is on the beta carbon. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(O-OCH3)-p-tolyl? I'm getting a bit stuck on this, but maybe it's more important to think about the reaction itself.

In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate). So the acrylate has the double bond between carbons 1 and 2 (CH2=CH-), and the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the beta carbon. Wait, no. Because (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? No, that can't be right. Maybe it's (E)-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. No, maybe I should draw it.
