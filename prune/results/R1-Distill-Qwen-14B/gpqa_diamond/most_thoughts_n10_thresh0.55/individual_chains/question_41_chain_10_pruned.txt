Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm. So, the setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is: what is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? And the options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with velocities in different reference frames, especially with light, special relativity comes into play. But wait, the glass is moving at velocity vâ€”so this is a scenario involving relative motion. But how does that affect the speed of light?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The speed of light in a medium isn't c, it's c divided by the refractive index. Oh right, because the medium slows down the light. So in the glass, the speed of light is v_glass = c/n, right? But wait, this is in the rest frame of the glass. Because when the glass is stationary relative to the observer, the light's speed is c/n.

But here, the glass is moving. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light beam? Hmm... this seems like a Doppler effect problem or maybe a velocity addition problem from relativity.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the speed of the light in the glass as observed from the lab. So the light's speed might be affected by the motion of
