Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects its brightness changes over time. The problem is asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as the star's spots do. 

Alright, so the star has a radius equal to the Sun. The spots are on one hemisphere, covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K.

The key here is to find the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar) such that the planet's transit causes the same change in brightness as the spots do.

Wait, but wait. The question says that if the star wasn't covered in spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in brightness variation. So I need to compute the brightness variation due to the spots and then find the planet that would cause the same.

First, let's figure out the brightness variation caused by the spots. The star is rotating, so as the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the brightness changes because the spots are cooler and thus emit less light. 

The brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference. The star's total brightness without spots is given by its luminosity. The spots decrease the brightness when they're facing us.

The star's luminosity when unspotted is L = 4πRstar²σTeff⁴. But when there are spots, the observed flux is a bit lower. The spots cover a fraction of the star's surface. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered, with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². So the spots cover 20% of that, so area = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Alternatively, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, so the area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but
