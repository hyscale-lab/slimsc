Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P, specifically for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Hmm, first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when the system is measured. The eigenvector here is for the operator P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. So I think I need to construct the operator P along the direction n and then find its eigenvector.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. That means it's a direction that can be represented by an angle θ from the z-axis, but since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the direction vector n would be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis.

But wait, the problem says it's along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, which probably means the direction can be parameterized by an angle θ, with φ=0 because it's in the x-z plane. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), as I thought.

So the operator P along n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vector. That is, P = n·σ * ħ/2. Wait, no, because each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given as ħ/2 times a certain matrix. Let me see: P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], P_y is (ħ/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]. Ah, right, these are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So the operator P along direction n would be P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me write that out. So n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So substituting, P = sinθ (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Let me compute this matrix.

Multiplying each term by (ħ/2), the first term (sinθ part) is [[0, sinθ],[sinθ, 0]], and the second term (cosθ part) is [[cosθ, 0],[0, -cosθ]]. Adding them together, the matrix P becomes:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Wait, no. Let me compute each element:

Top-left: cosθ (from P_z) and 0 from P_x. So top-left is (ħ/2)(cosθ +0) = (ħ/2) cosθ.

Wait, no, because P is written as n_x P_x + n_z P_z. So let me correct that. Each component:

P = n_x*(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z*(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the matrix for P would be:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z*1, n_x*1],
          [n_x*1, -n_z*1] ]

Because the P_x matrix has 1s off-diagonal, and P_z has 1 and -1 on diagonal.

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So that's the matrix form of the operator P.

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = eigenvalue |ψ>.

So, (P - λ I) |ψ> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue.

Here, λ is +ħ/2. So plugging in:

P - (ħ/2) I = 0 matrix.

So the matrix P - (ħ/2) I is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ - 1 ] ]

Wait, because I subtract (ħ/2) times identity matrix:

Each diagonal element of P is [cosθ, -cosθ], so subtracting (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1) respectively? Wait, no. Let me re-express the matrix P again.

Wait, P is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ,-
