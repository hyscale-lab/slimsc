Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, the question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let's break this down.

First, I need to figure out what the target structure looks like. The name suggests a cyclohexane ring attached to a carbonyl group (carbaldehyde), and another group that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, the structure should have a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is connected to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part. Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond) attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡CH. Or wait, no—ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -CH₂-C≡CH group attached? Or is it a triple bond directly attached? Wait, no, ethynyl is the substituent, so it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡CH? Or is the triple bond between the cyclohexane and another carbon? Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH,
