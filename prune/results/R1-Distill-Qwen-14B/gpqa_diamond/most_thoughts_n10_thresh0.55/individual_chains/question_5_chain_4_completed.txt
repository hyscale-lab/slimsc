Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to unpack what the question is asking.

The problem says that we're dealing with a muon, which I think is just a particle similar to an electron but with a different mass. But maybe the mass isn't too relevant here. The operator in question is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n is a vector in the x-z plane, which means it's in the horizontal plane if I imagine the y-axis coming out of the screen. So any direction in x-z would have angles like theta measured from the x-axis, perhaps.

We are to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Oh right, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental in quantum mechanics because operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the states in which the observable has a definite value (the eigenvalue).

The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0, 1] and second row [1, 0]. So that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0, -i], second row [i, 0]. That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled by ħ/2. Pz is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [1, 0], second row [0, -1]. That's the Pauli Z matrix scaled by ħ/2.

But the operator we're interested in is P along the direction n. So P is the vector operator, and the operator along direction n is given by the dot product of n with the vector P. So P = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz.

Wait, but the direction n is in the x-z plane. That means the vector n has components (nx, 0, nz). Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So when we construct P along n, the ny term will drop out. Therefore, P = nx Px + nz Pz.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction can be represented as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps, where θ is the angle from the x-axis. Or maybe n has components (cosθ, 0, sinθ), depending on convention. Hmm, but the specific angles might not matter right now.

So, the operator P along n is P = nx Px + nz Pz.

Let me write that out. Since each component (Px, Py, Pz) is a matrix multiplied by ħ/2, the operator P can be written as:

P = (nx * [Pauli X] + nz * [Pauli Z]) * (ħ/2)

So, the matrix for P is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix (nx * [[0 1],[1 0]] + nz * [[1 0],[0 -1]]).

Wait, let me make that explicit. Let me compute the matrix inside.

Let me denote the unit vector n as (n_x, 0, n_z). So, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

Then, the matrix part of P is:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1, 0],[0, -1]]

Adding these matrices:

The (1,1) element is n_z * 1.

The (1,2) element is n_x * 1.

The (2,1) element is n_x * 1.

The (2,2) element is -n_z * 1.

So the matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So P = (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Now, we need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Eigenvectors satisfy the equation P |v> = lambda |v>, where lambda is the eigenvalue.

We have lambda = +ħ/2.

So, the equation is:

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Wait, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so lambda is ħ/2.

Wait, no: Let me correct that. Wait, the eigenvalue equation is:

P |v> = lambda |v>

So,

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = lambda [a; b]

But the given eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So lambda is ħ/2. So,

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to eliminate the scaling factor:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So, the equation becomes:

n_z a + n_x b = a   ...(1)

n_x a - n_z b = b   ...(2)

So, equation (1): (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

Equation (2): n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Wait, let me re-arrange the terms.

Equation (1): (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

Equation (2): n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0

Wait, no, equation (2):

n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a = (n_z +1) b → n_x a = (n_z + 1) b

Similarly, equation (1): n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

Now, we can write these as a system of equations:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

We can solve this system for a and b.

Let me write it in matrix form:

[ (n_z -1)   n_x ] [a]   = 0
[  n_x       -(n_z +1) ] [b]

For a non-trivial solution (a and b not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, since the system is homogeneous, we can write the equations and express a in terms of b or vice versa.

Let me take equation (1):

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 → (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Similarly, equation (2):

n_x a = (n_z + 1) b → a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b

Wait, so both expressions for a must be equal.

So,

- n_x / (n_z -1) = (n_z +1)/n_x → Let me cross-multiply:

- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) )

Right side is n_z^2 -1.

So,

- n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1 → n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

Wait, but we already know that since n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So the condition holds, which makes sense. So the two equations are consistent.

Thus, the eigenvectors can be found by choosing a ratio of a to b.

Let me choose a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b from equation (2).

Let me take b as a parameter. So,

a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b

But since the eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar multiple, we can set b =1, and then a = (n_z +1)/n_x.

Wait, but wait, n_x can be zero? Because n is in the x-z plane, but if n_x is zero, that would mean n is along the z-axis. But in that case, let's see. Let me think about that case.

Wait, if n_x is zero, then the direction is along z. So the operator P would be (ħ/2) Pz, because nx is zero and nz is 1.

Then, the eigenvalues are +/- ħ/2. So the eigenvectors would be the standard spin-up and spin-down along z.

But in that case, when n_x=0, the ratio a/b would be (n_z +1)/0, which is undefined. So perhaps we need to handle that as a special case, but for now, let's proceed under the assumption that n_x is not zero.

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

[a; b] = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ; 1 ]

But we need to normalize this vector.

So the normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

Compute |a|^2 + |b|^2:

| (n_z +1)/n_x |^2 + |1|^2 = [ (n_z +1)^2 + n_x^2 ] / n_x^2

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, let me expand (n_z +1)^2:

(n_z +1)^2 = n_z^2 + 2 n_z +1

So numerator becomes:

n_z^2 + 2 n_z +1 + n_x^2 = (n_x^2 + n_z^2) ) + 2 n_z +1 = 1 + 2 n_z +1 = 2 (1 + n_z )

So,

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = [2 (1 + n_z) ] / n_x^2

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt( 2 (1 + n_z) / n_x^2 ) ) = |n_x| / sqrt( 2 (1 + n_z) )

But wait, n_x could be positive or negative. Since we have |n_x| in the numerator, perhaps I should consider taking n_x positive without loss of generality, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the normalized vector as:

v = ( [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ] ) / sqrt( ( (n_z +1)^2 + n_x^2 ) / n_x^2 ) )

Which is the same as [ (n_z +1), n_x ]^T * ( n_x ) / sqrt( (n_z+1)^2 + n_x^2 )

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to write the components as:

a = (n_z +1)/(sqrt( (n_z+1)^2 + n_x^2 )) * (n_x)

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express the vector in terms of spherical coordinates.

Alternatively, considering that the direction n is in the x-z plane, perhaps it's better to express n as (cosθ, 0, sinθ). Then, n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ.

So, substituting n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ.

Then, the ratio a/b becomes (n_z +1)/n_x = (sinθ +1)/cosθ.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ , 1 ].

But let's compute the normalization.

Compute (a)^2 + (b)^2 = [ (sinθ +1)^2 / cos²θ ] + 1.

Which is [ (sinθ +1)^2 + cos²θ ] / cos²θ.

Expanding (sinθ +1)^2 = sin²θ + 2 sinθ +1.

So numerator becomes: sin²θ + 2 sinθ +1 + cos²θ = (sin²θ + cos²θ) ) + 2 sinθ +1 = 1 + 2 sinθ +1 = 2(1 + sinθ )

So sqrt of denominator is cosθ.

So the normalization factor is 1 / sqrt( 2 (1 + sinθ ) / cos²θ ) )

Wait, wait, let's compute the normalization factor.

The denominator in the expression [ (sinθ +1)^2 / cos²θ + 1 ] is:

[ (sinθ +1)^2 + cos^2θ ] / cos²θ = [ 2(1 + sinθ) ] / cos²θ.

So the sum is 2(1 + sinθ) / cos²θ.

So the normalization factor is 1 / sqrt( 2(1 + sinθ) / cos²θ ) ) = cosθ / sqrt( 2(1 + sinθ) )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (sinθ +1)/cosθ , 1 ] * [ cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ) ) ) ]

Simplify each component.

First component: [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ ] * [ cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ) ) ) ] = (sinθ +1) / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) )

Which simplifies to sqrt( (1+sinθ) ) / sqrt(2) )? Wait,

Wait, (1 + sinθ) = (1 + sinθ), so (1 + sinθ ) / sqrt(2 (1 + sinθ) ) ) = sqrt( (1 + sinθ) ) / sqrt(2) )

So that's sqrt( (1 + sinθ) ) / sqrt(2 )

Similarly, the second component is 1 * [ cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ) ) ) ]

So the two components are:

sqrt( (1 + sinθ) ) / sqrt(2 ), and [ cosθ / sqrt(2 (1 + sinθ) ) ]

Wait, but let me check that again.

Wait, the first component:

= [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ ] * [ cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ) ) ) ]

The cosθ cancels out.

= (sinθ +1) / sqrt(2 (1 + sinθ) )

Which is sqrt( (1 + sinθ) ) since (1 + sinθ) / sqrt(1 + sinθ) ) = sqrt(1 + sinθ).

So first component: sqrt( (1 + sinθ) ) / sqrt(2 )

Second component:

= [1 ] * [ cosθ / sqrt(2 (1 + sinθ) ) ]

= cosθ / sqrt( 2 (1 + sinθ) )

So the normalized eigenvector is ( sqrt( (1 + sinθ) ) / sqrt(2 ), cosθ / sqrt(2 (1 + sinθ) ) )

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. But perhaps we can express it using trigonometric identities.

Wait, 1 + sinθ can be written as 2 sin²(θ/2 + π/4) ), but maybe it's easier to make a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express this in terms of theta/2.

Wait, let me let theta be the angle from the x-axis to the direction n in the x-z plane. So, for the eigenvector, the components depend on theta.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is the standard spin-up state along a direction theta in the x-z plane, I think.

Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, when you have an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, the eigenstates are given by the spin coherent states, which can be written using rotation matrices. For example, the eigenstates of S·n, where n is in the x-z plane, are |+> = cos(theta/2)|0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|1> }, but since phi is zero here (n is in x-z plane, so phi=0), it becomes cos(theta/2) |0> + sin(theta/2) |1>.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which corresponds to spin-up along direction n.

So the eigenvector should be cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2).

Wait, but in our problem, the components we computed are:

[ sqrt( (1 + sinθ) ) / sqrt(2 ), cosθ / sqrt(2 (1 + sinθ) ) ]

But let me compute (1 + sinθ) in terms of theta/2.

Using the identity: 1 + sinθ = 2 sin²(theta/2 + pi/4) ), but another approach is to use 1 + sinθ = [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]^2.

Wait, let me compute 1 + sinθ.

1 + sinθ = 1 + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2.

So sqrt(1 + sinθ) = sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2).

So our first component becomes [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 )

And the second component is cosθ / [ sqrt(2) * ( sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ) ]

Wait, but let me compute cos theta. Cos theta can be written as cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2) = ( cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ) ( cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) )

So cos theta = (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) ( cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) )

So the second component becomes:

[ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ) ] / [ sqrt(2) (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ) ]

The (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) terms cancel out, leaving (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) / sqrt(2 )

So now, the eigenvector components are:

[ (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) / sqrt(2 ), (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) / sqrt(2) ]

Which can be factored as:

[ (1/sqrt(2)) (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)), (1/sqrt(2)) (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) ]

Wait, but that's the same as:

cos(theta/2) (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 1] + sin(theta/2) (1/sqrt(2)) [1, -1]

Hmm, which is a particular combination. But perhaps I can write each component more simply.

Wait, let me think. The first component is (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) / sqrt(2) = [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2) = [1/sqrt(2)] ( cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) )

Which can be written as cos(theta/2 - 45°), because cos a cos 45 + sin a sin 45 = cos(a-45). So [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2) = cos(theta/2 - pi/4), assuming theta is in radians.

Similarly, the second component is (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) / sqrt(2) = cos(theta/2 + pi/4).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 - pi/4), cos(theta/2 + pi/4) ].

But wait, this seems a bit more complicated than the standard form. Let me think about the standard form.

In quantum mechanics, for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvectors of S·n (where n is in the x-z plane) can be written as:

|+> = cos(theta/2)|0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|1>,

but since phi=0 here, it's simply cos(theta/2) |0> + sin(theta/2) |1>.

So the components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, but wait a second, in our case, the eigenvector we found doesn't match this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach I took to find the eigenvector is correct, but I made a mistake in the substitution.

Let me go back.

The eigenvector we're finding is for the operator P = nx Px + nz Pz, which is equivalent to (ħ/2) times [n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z].

Wait, sigma matrices are the Pauli matrices. So the eigenvalue equation is:

( (n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z ) ) (a,b)^T = [a; b].

Wait, no, we have P |v> = (ħ/2) (n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z ) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

But the eigenvalue is ħ/2, so:

( n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z ) |v> = |v>

So the equation is (n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z ) |v> = |v>

Which implies that:

(n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z ) |v> = 1 * |v>

So the matrix (n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z ) has eigenvalue 1 when |v> is the eigenvector.

Wait, but in that case, the matrix is:

n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which gives:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the equation is:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives:

n_z a + n_x b = a → equation (1): (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a - n_z b = b → equation (2): n_x a - (n_z +1) b =0

From equation (1): (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b

From equation (2): n_x a = (n_z +1) b → a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b

Setting the two expressions for a equal:

[ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ]

Cross-multiplying: -n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = n_z^2 -1

So, -n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1 → n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1, which holds as n is a unit vector.

So the ratio a/b is (n_z +1)/n_x.

So a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.

Let me express this in terms of theta.

Since n is in the x-z plane, n = (n_x, 0, n_z) = (cosθ, 0, sinθ), assuming θ is the angle from the x-axis.

So substituting n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ.

Then, a = [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ ] b.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ , 1 ].

Wait, but let's normalize this vector.

The vector is [a, b] = [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ , 1 ]

The norm squared is:

[ (sinθ +1)^2 / cos²θ + 1 ]

Which is [ (sinθ +1)^2 + cos²θ ] / cos²θ

Expanding numerator:

sin²θ + 2 sinθ +1 + cos²θ = (sin²θ + cos²θ ) + 2 sinθ +1 = 1 + 2 sinθ +1 = 2(1 + sinθ )

So the norm is sqrt( 2(1 + sinθ ) ) / cosθ )

Wait, no, the sum is [ (sinθ +1)^2 + cos^2θ ] / cos^2θ = [ 2(1 + sinθ) ] / cos²θ.

So the norm is sqrt( [2(1 + sinθ)] / cos²θ ) ) = sqrt(2(1+sinθ )) / |cosθ|.

But since we're dealing with a unit vector, cosθ can be positive or negative. Let's assume cosθ is positive for the time being, so |cosθ|=cosθ.

So the normalization factor is 1 / sqrt( 2(1 + sinθ) ) * cosθ.

Wait, the vector is [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ , 1 ].

Multiply each component by cosθ:

So the vector can be written as [ (sinθ +1), cosθ ].

Then, the norm squared is (sinθ +1)^2 + cos²θ = 2(1 + sinθ ), as before.

So the normalized vector is [ (sinθ +1), cosθ ] / sqrt( 2(1 + sinθ) )

So each component is:

a = (sinθ +1) / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) ) = sqrt( (1 + sinθ) ) / sqrt(2 )

And b = cosθ / sqrt( 2(1 + sinθ) )

Simplify a:

= sqrt( (1 + sinθ) ) / sqrt(2 )

Similarly, for b:

= cosθ / [ sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 + sinθ) ) ]

Which can be written as [ cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ) ) ]

Now, perhaps using trigonometric identities, can I express these terms in terms of theta/2?

Let me recall that 1 + sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2, or perhaps more usefully, 1 + sinθ = (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2))^2.

Yes, expanding (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2))^2 = sin²(theta/2) + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + cos²(theta/2) = 1 + sin theta.

So, sqrt(1 + sinθ) = sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2).

Similarly, cos theta = cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2) = (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2))(cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)).

So, let's substitute these into a and b.

a = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 )

b = [ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) (cos(theta/2)+sin(theta/2)) ] / [ sqrt(2) ( sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ) ) ]

The (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) terms cancel, so b becomes:

[ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 )

So now, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2))/sqrt(2), (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2))/sqrt(2) ]

Which can be rewritten as:

[ (1/sqrt(2))(cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)), (1/sqrt(2))(cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) ]

Hmm, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would be the case if the eigenvector were simply the spin-up state along the direction theta, which it should be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the substitution. Because the standard spin-up state along any direction (theta, phi) is given by:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2) |0> + e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) |1>.

But in our case, since phi is zero (because n is in the x-z plane), this reduces to:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |0> + sin(theta/2) |1>.

So the components should be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But according to our earlier calculation, the components are [ (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2))/sqrt(2), (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2))/sqrt(2) ]

Wait, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the direction of the vector n in the x-z plane, but perhaps I misapplied the angle. Let me think: if n is in the x-z plane, then the angle theta could be measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis. So, the standard spin-up along this direction would have components [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

But according to our earlier calculation, the components are different. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector I found is correct, but it can be rewritten in terms of the standard spin-up state.

Wait, let me compute the components I found:

a = (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)) / sqrt(2 )

b = (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) / sqrt(2 )

Hmm, but a is positive. Let me compute the ratio a/b:

a/b = [ (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)) ] / [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ]

Which can be written as [ (1 + tan(theta/2)) ] / [ 1 - tan(theta/2) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can factor sqrt(2) as follows:

a = [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 ) = cos(theta/2) * (1/sqrt(2)) + sin(theta/2) * (1/sqrt(2))

Similarly, b = [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 )

Which is the same as:

a = (1/sqrt(2)) (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) )

b = (1/sqrt(2)) (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) )

Hmm, but that doesn't seem to match the standard form.

Wait, let me think about a specific case. Let me take theta=0. So the direction n is along the x-axis. So n = (1,0,0).

In that case, the eigenvector should be [1, 0], since along x, the eigenstate |+> is [1, 0].

But according to our earlier result, when theta=0:

a = [ (0 + 1) ] / sqrt(2 ) = 1/sqrt(2 )

b = [ (1 - 0) ] / sqrt(2 ) = 1/sqrt(2 )

So the eigenvector would be [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ]

But wait, that can't be right because along x, the eigenstates are |+x> = [1, 1]/sqrt(2), |−x> = [1, -1]/sqrt(2).

Ah, wait, so in this case, when theta=0, the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 should be [1, 1]/sqrt(2 ), which is the same as our result. But that's for the + eigenvalue along x.

Wait, but the operator P along x would give eigenvalues +/- ħ/2. So the eigenvector for +ħ/2 along x is [1,1]/sqrt(2 ), which matches our calculation.

So that suggests that our calculation is correct.

But wait, earlier I thought that the standard spin-up state would have components [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, let's compute that for theta=0, cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0. So the eigenvector would be [1,0], which is correct for the +x eigenstate, but according to our calculation, the +x eigenstate is [1,1]/sqrt(2 ). That's a contradiction.

Wait, that's a problem. Because I thought that along x, the eigenstates are |+x> = [1,1]/sqrt(2 ), |−x> = [1,-1]/sqrt(2 ).

But wait, according to the standard representation, the eigenstates are:

For S_x, the eigenstates are (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2 ).

So, when theta=0, the direction is along x, and the eigenvector is (1,1)/sqrt(2 ), which matches our result.

But when I think of the standard spin-up state along a direction theta, it's usually written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but that's when the direction is in the x-z plane and the angle theta is measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from the definition of theta.

In our case, theta is the angle from the x-axis in the x-z plane. So in the standard convention, if theta is measured from the z-axis, then the spin-up state would have components (sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2)), but I'm getting a bit confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to let the angle be measured from the z-axis. Let me think again.

If n is in the x-z plane, making an angle theta with the z-axis, then n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta.

Wait, that depends on the coordinate system. Perhaps I should have defined theta as the angle from the z-axis. So, if n is in the x-z plane, then theta is the angle between n and the z-axis, so n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta.

Wait, but in that case, the direction theta=0 would be along z, and theta=pi/2 along x.

Hmm, let me try this substitution.

Let me define n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta, with theta being the angle from the z-axis. So when theta=0, n is along z, theta=pi/2 along x.

In this case, the eigenvector components become:

a = [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 )

b = [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 )

Wait, but substituting n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck in a loop here. Let me approach it differently.

Looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would be the standard spin-up state if theta is the angle from the z-axis.

But according to our earlier calculation, the eigenvector is [ (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)) / sqrt(2 ), (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) / sqrt(2 ) ]

Which can be written as:

[ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) , cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 )

Which for the standard spin-up state would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

So, perhaps our approach was wrong, and the correct eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the operator P is along n, which is in x-z, but perhaps I should have used a different approach, such as diagonalizing the matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way.

The operator P along n is given by (ħ/2)(n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z )

The eigenstates can be found by diagonalizing this matrix.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that the eigenstates of a spin-1/2 operator along a direction n are given by the spin coherent states, which are:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2) |0> + e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) |1>,

where theta is the angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. In our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi=0. So the state becomes:

e^{0} cos(theta/2) |0> + e^{0} sin(theta/2) |1> → cos(theta/2) |0> + sin(theta/2) |1>.

So the components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So, that's option C.

But wait, according to our earlier calculation, the eigenvector was [ (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) )/sqrt(2 ), (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ) / sqrt(2 ) ]

So there must be a mistake in the earlier approach.

Let me think again about the initial setup.

The operator P is given as P = nx Px + nz Pz, but each of Px, Py, Pz is multiplied by ħ/2.

So P = (ħ/2) (nx sigma_x + nz sigma_z )

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So, (nx sigma_x + nz sigma_z ) |v> = |v>

Which implies that sigma·n |v> = |v>, where sigma·n is the vector of Pauli matrices dotted with n.

The eigenvalues of sigma·n are ±1, so the eigenvalue here is 1.

The eigenvector for sigma·n =1 is the spin-up state along n, which is cos(theta/2) |0> + sin(theta/2) |1>, if n is in the x-z plane (phi=0).

So that's option C.

But that contradicts the earlier approach where I found a different eigenvector. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the operator is P = (ħ/2)(sigma·n ), and the eigenvalue is (ħ/2)(+1), so the eigenvector is the same as the spin-up state along n.

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which matches option C.

So, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ are the Pauli matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
(n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z) |v\rangle = |v\rangle,
\]

where $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices. Substituting $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, the matrix form of the operator becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvectors of this matrix correspond to the spin-up and spin-down states along the direction $\vec{n}$. For the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, the eigenvector is the spin-up state along $\vec{n}$, which is given by:

\[
|+\rangle = \cos(\theta/2) |0\rangle + \sin(\theta/2) |1\rangle.
\]

In component form, this corresponds to:

\[
\left(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)\right).
\]

This matches the standard spin-up state along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Comparing with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))**

This represents the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$.
