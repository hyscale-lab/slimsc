Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. They react violently and release a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases gas B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. 

Wait, 277 K is roughly 4 degrees Celsius, right? So B is probably a solid at normal temperatures but just above freezing. Hmm, common substances with that melting point... Maybe something like ice? No, ice melts at 273 K, which is 0Â°C. But 277 is a bit higher, so maybe another substance. Wait, what about something else. Oh, maybe something like paraffin wax? Or maybe something else entirely. I'm not sure yet.

The product of a keto acid reacting with Substance X has two oxygen atoms. I remember that keto acids are like acids with a ketone group, such as acetoacetic acid or something similar. But when a keto acid reacts with something, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack or a substitution.

Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Oh wait, that makes me think of something like iodine maybe, because in organic reactions, iodine is sometimes used as a reagent. Or perhaps another element known for having heavy isotopes. Alternatively, maybe it's something like sulfur or phosphorus, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the reaction releases a gas with same neutrons and protons. So if the molecule of gas W has equal protons and neutrons, let's think. Let's say the molecule is something like H2O, but wait, H has 0 neutrons, O has 8, so that's not equal. Maybe CH4? No, that's 6 and 4. Wait, no, wait. The molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons in each atom? Or in the whole molecule? Let me read that again. The problem says: "gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." Oh, wait, same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. Or does it mean each atom in the molecule, or the total? Hmm, probably each molecule. So for example, each molecule has
