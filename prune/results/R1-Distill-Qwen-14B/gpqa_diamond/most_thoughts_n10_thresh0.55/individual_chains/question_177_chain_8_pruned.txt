Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. Hmm, I remember that luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says that Luminosity (L) is proportional to radius squared times temperature to the fourth power. So the formula is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Both stars have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. Wait, the peak wavelength? Oh, that's from Wien's law. Wien's displacement law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same because λ1_max = λ2_max implies T1 = T2. Oh wait, but wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The problem says they have the same wavelengths at which they appear brightest. So that must be the same λ_max. So yes, T1 = T2 because λ_max is the same. Oh, so both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point.

But wait, the problem says they computed the luminosity using black body radiation, so we can ignore other factors. So L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is the same for both, the luminosity ratio should be (R1/R2)² = (1.5)^
