Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the velocities because of the speed addition formula. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait, I might have that wrong. Let me think, if you're moving at v with respect to the other, the relative speed isn't just v1 - v2. Oh, right, the formula is (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)).

Wait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So from astronaut 2's frame, the speed of astronaut 1 would be (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, so 0.6c -0.5c is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 -
