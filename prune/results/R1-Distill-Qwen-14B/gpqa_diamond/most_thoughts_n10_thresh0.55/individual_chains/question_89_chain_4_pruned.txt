Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The ¹H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). Also, there's an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. 

Wait, thinking about the IR. A peak around 1720 usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. But since KOH is a strong base, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction. Oh, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane heating with KOH... that's a classic elimination reaction. So two dehydrohalogenation steps might occur here.

Dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides typically forms alkenes. So if we eliminate two HBr molecules, the product would be an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons? Or are they on the same ring? Hmm, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on two adjacent carbons on the adamantane framework.

Eliminating HBr twice would form an double bond. So product 1 would be adamantylene, which is an all-carbon compound with a double bond. But wait, wait. The IR shows 1720, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, that's confusing. Unless the reaction isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, maybe the first step isn't elimination. Another possibility is a substitution. KOH can lead to substitution if the structure allows. But dihalides typically do elimination, especially with strong bases and heat.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's around where an alcohol's proton might appear, but more likely it's an ether, or perhaps a carbonyl. Or, wait, maybe a ketone's adjacent protons
