Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit puzzled. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that the pp chain is a major source of energy in the Sun, and different branches contribute to different neutrino energies. So, if the pp-III branch stops, how does that affect the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands?

First, I need to recall what the pp-III branch is. From what I remember, the proton-proton chain has several branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, producing helium-4 and positrons. The pp-II branch produces boron-8, which then decays into Be-8 and emits a positron and a neutrino. The pp-III branch is another part, perhaps involving higher energy reactions. Oh right, the pp-III branch might involve the fusion of three protons, leading to the production of deuterium and then helium-3. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, pp-III could be a higher-order process in the chain, possibly producing higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in the Sun primarily in the proton-proton chain. The main neutrinos come from the decay of boron-8, which is part of the pp-I branch. Wait, no, wait: the pp-I branch is the main one, which goes into He-4. The pp-II branch is a minor contributor that produces B-8, which later decays into Be-8, then into two He-4 nuclei, and emits a neutrino in the process. So the neutrinos from B-8 decay are higher energy compared to the main pp-I neutrinos?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The main pp chain produces He-4, and during the process, a positron and a neutrino are emitted. So the main neutrinos are from the pp-I branch, which are lower energy. But the pp-II branch produces B-8, which then decays into Be-8, and then into two He-4. When Be-8 decays, it emits a positron and a neutrino. Those are the so-called "B-8 neutrinos," which have higher energy than the main pp neutrinos. 

So if the pp-III branch stopped, what does that mean? I think the pp-III branch is another part of the chain
