Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the problem again.

So, there are two stars, each with the same mass as our Sun. Astronomers found exoplanets around each using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The orbits are circular.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. Planet #1 caused a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. They ask how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves due to the planet's gravity, causing the spectral lines to shift periodically. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

Wait, but both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses. So perhaps the main difference comes from their orbital periods and distances.

Wait, but the Doppler shift (wavelength shift) is related to the star's velocity. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude K of the velocity is given by a formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance (or something like that).

The formula I think is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(a * (1 - e²)^(0.5))) ) ... but wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K can be approximated with the formula:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π c ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²) )

But since both planets are similar in mass to Neptune and the stars are similar to the Sun, and the orbits are circular (e=0), so 1 - e² =1. So that term drops out.

But M_p is much smaller than M_star (Sun-like stars and Neptune is much less massive), so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, but I'm more confident
