Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each a different power law. 

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, and so on. But how does that tie into the number of stars we observe?

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out the same way in all directions. So if I imagine looking out into space, the density of stars remains constant throughout. But how does that affect the number of stars at different parallax ranges?

I think I need to consider how volume changes with distance. Parallax is 1/distance, so distance d is 1/plx. So as plx increases (meaning closer stars), the distance decreases. But when plx is small, the distance is large, so those are stars that are very far away.

Volume in 3D space is (4/3)πr³. So the volume increases with the cube of the radius. But since distance is 1/plx, the volume would be proportional to (1/plx)^3. So volume is ~ 1/plx³.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + dplx would be the volume of that shell multiplied by the number density of stars.

The volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. Since d = 1/plx, dd would be the change in distance. Let me express everything in terms of plx.

So, d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since I'm looking for a positive value, I can ignore the negative sign for now.

The volume element in terms of plx would then be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Because d =1/plx, so d squared is 1/plx², and dd is 1/plx² dplx. So putting it all together:

dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) dplx → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, wait, wait. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the differential volume between plx and plx + dplx.

The distance at plx is d = 1/plx. The next distance is d + dd, where dd = (1/(plx + dplx))) - (1/plx). But that might get complicated. Alternatively, using calculus, the volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume at plx plus that shell.

Alternatively, the volume as a function of plx is proportional to (1/plx)^3. So the differential volume dV with respect to plx would be the derivative of (4/3 π (1/plx)^3) with respect to plx. Let me compute that.

dV/dplx = derivative of (4/3 π (plx)^-3) = 4/3 π * (-3) (
