Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through it. I remember that when atoms are in certain energy levels, their excitation depends on the temperature of the star. Oh right, this is related to the Boltzmann distribution. 

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, which is e^(-ΔE/(kT)). Wait, or is it e^(-ΔE/(kT))? I think it's e^(-E/(kT)), where E is the energy of the state. 

So the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (E1 and E2) is given by the Boltzmann equation: (n1/n2) = e^((E2 - E1)/(kT)). Or wait, maybe I have that backwards. Let me think again. The higher energy level has lower population because of the exponential. So in this case, the specific energy level in star_1 is more excited (twice as much as star_2's same level). 

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So the number of atoms in that energy level for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let's call the energy levels E for both stars. Because it's the same transition, the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars, right? It's given as 1.38e-23 J. 

So the ratio of the populations is (n1_star1 / n1_star2) = 2. 

According to the Boltzmann distribution, (n_i / n_j) = e^((E_j - E_i)/(kT)). So if we have two stars, star_1 and star_2, each with their own temperatures T1 and T2, then for each star, the ratio is based on their respective temperatures.

Wait, for star_1, the ratio of the excited state to the lower state is (n_upper / n_lower) = e^(-ΔE/(k T1)), and similarly for star_2 it's e^(-ΔE/(k T2)). 

But in the question, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, no, the question says the atoms in star_
