Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh, and the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions. So when Ca forms a complex with EDTA, it's like Ca-EDTA^2- or something like that. But the exact formula might not matter right now.

The question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So, the solution has the Ca-EDTA complex, but some of that complex will dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions. The dissociation depends on the stability constant, K.

So, the K for the complex is given as K_Ca-EDTA = 5x10^10. I think K is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formation constant K_f is usually written as [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). So, if K is large, the complex is very stable, meaning that the concentration of free Ca and EDTA in solution will be very low.

Wait, the formula for the formation constant. Let me write it out:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-
K_f = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-])

So, the problem gives K_f as 5e10. So the complex is very stable.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, initially, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] are zero because all Ca is complexed.

But over time, the complex will dissociate a little, so some Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- will form. The extent of dissociation is small because K_f is very large, so the dissociation is minimal.

Let me set up an ICE table. I'll let x be
