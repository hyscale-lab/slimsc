Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, right? It's about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that in crystals, especially in the cubic system, the interplanar distance (d) is calculated using the formula d = a / √(h² + k² + l²), where a is the lattice parameter and hkl are the Miller indices. But wait, this is a rhombohedral crystal, not cubic. Oh right, rhombohedral has all sides equal but the angles aren't 90 degrees. So the formula must be different.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with a rhombohedral structure involves the angles between the lattice vectors. The formula is something like d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cosα + kl cosβ + lh cosγ) ) ), but wait, I'm not sure about the exact terms. Alternatively, maybe it's d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + kl + lh) * cosθ ), but that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, I think the formula is more like d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) / a² - 2(hk + kl + lh) cosθ / a² ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

No, wait,
