Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

Astronomers are looking at a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on the surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When there are spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. So, I think this has something to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The equation is something like n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n is the number density, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, right. The ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) ). But wait, sometimes it's written with the denominator as (E2 - E1). Let me make sure. The general form is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E_i > E_j, then the exponent is negative, so the ratio will be less than one if the denominator is higher.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So normally, without spots, the ratio is higher, and when spots are present, it's lower. So without spots, the Teff is higher (6000 K) compared to when spots are present (5500 K).

Wait, but wait. Wait, the effective temperature is for the overall photosphere. But the spots might be cooler. Oh, but the problem says when the spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So in that case, the average temperature of the
