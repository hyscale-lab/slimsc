Okay, let's try to work through this chemistry problem. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

So, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let's see what the problem says. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate these two pH values.

First, I think I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³ and the concentration is 0.05 M. Then we add another 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³.

Wait, right. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 would be (0.05 M * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, let me think. The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles = Molarity * Volume (L) = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the initial acetic acid solution was 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So moles before dilution are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles as well. Then when diluted, the moles don't change, right? Because dilution just spreads it out. So in the diluted solution, it's still 0.001 moles of acetic acid in 0.04 L.

So when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles NaOH needed = 0.001 moles.

The volume of NaOH needed would be (moles)/(Molarity) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

25% titration means 25% of the equivalence volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Let me handle each part one by one.

First, the pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

Each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of CH3COOH, producing a mole of acetate ion.

So, let's calculate the moles at 25% titration. Moles of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³ * 0.1 M = 0.25 mL * 0.1 M = 0.00025 moles. Wait, 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. So 0.1 M * 0.0
