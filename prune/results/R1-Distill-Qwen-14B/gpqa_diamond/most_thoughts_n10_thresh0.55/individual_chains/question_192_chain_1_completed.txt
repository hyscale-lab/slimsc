Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let's see what I can figure out. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, so the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity.

The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions for E.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. When a conductor is neutral, charges can move freely. But when a conductor is isolated and has charges, the charges reside on the outer surface. But wait, this conductor is initially uncharged. So, when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, how does that affect the conductor?

I think the cavity is non-conducting because it's a spherical cavity, so the charge +q induces charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance it out.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. When you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced -q charge because the conductor's electrons are attracted to the positive charge. But since the conductor itself is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, and the inner surface has -q.

But wait, no. Wait, the conductor's total charge is zero. When you put +q inside the cavity (which is inside the conductor), the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) must have an induced charge of -q. So the conductor's own material must have a +q on the outer surface to balance the -q on the inner surface, making the total charge zero again. Because the conductor was initially neutral, that's correct.

But wait, if the conductor is uncharged, and the cavity contains a charge +q, then the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, so that the conductor's net charge is zero. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, the sum of inner and outer charges is zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q.

So, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. Because the outer surface is a conductor, the charge distributes uniformly on the outer surface. So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, it's as if all the charge +q is concentrated at the center.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. So when we're outside the conductor, the electric field due to the charges on the conductor is as if all the charge were at the center. Because of the shell theorem, the charges on a spherical shell contribute nothing inside, and outside, they act as if all the charge is at the center.

So, the field at point P would be due to the charge +q at the center of the conductor. So the electric field should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because L is the distance from the center to point P.

Looking at the options, option B is 1/(4πε₀) * q/L². So that's what it would be, right?

Wait, but why are the other options present? Let me think again. The charge +q is inside the cavity, which is inside the conductor. The conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So when you're outside the conductor, the conductor behaves as if all its charge is at the center. So the field would be as if the +q is at the center.

Wait, but the position of the charge inside the cavity—does it matter? Because the induced charges are on the inner surface, so the electric field inside the conductor (but outside the cavity) would be zero because it's a conductor. But outside, the field is as if the +q is at the center of the conductor.

So regardless of where the +q is inside the cavity, the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and the position is the center of the conductor.

So point P is outside, distance L from the conductor's center. So E is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

Wait, but the other options involve l and s and cos(theta). So why are they present? Perhaps if the charge were outside the conductor, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again about the setup. The cavity is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the charge is not at the center of the conductor. Does that affect anything?

Wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q, but the inner surface has -q. But the point P is outside the conductor, so when considering the external field, all the charges on the conductor (which is +q on the outer surface) contribute as if they are at the center, regardless of the charge's position inside the cavity.

So the displacement of the charge within the cavity (s and theta and l) don't affect the external field because the conductor's outer surface's charge distribution is uniform. Wait, no—wait, the conductor's outer surface would have a uniform charge distribution only if it's a shell. But in this case, the conductor is a solid sphere with a cavity. So when you induce charges in the inner surface, the outer surface would still distribute the charge uniformly because it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium.

Wait, but wait: the conductor is a solid sphere, so when you have a cavity inside it, the charges on the inner surface are induced by the charge inside the cavity. The conductor's material is a conductor, so the outer surface would have a uniform charge distribution, because the conductor is neutral overall except for the induced charges.

So the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge of the outer surface, which is +q, and the distance from the center. Therefore, the field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking back at the options, option B is exactly this. So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity is separated from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and its radius is $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, where the distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Induced Charges**: When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface. The charge on the outer surface distributes uniformly due to the conductor's properties. Thus, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if the charge is concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Effect of the Cavity's Position**: The position of the charge inside the cavity (determined by $s$, $l$, and $\theta$) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the outer surface of the conductor screens the internal charges, and the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface.

4. **Electric Field at Point $P$**: Since the outer surface of the conductor has a total charge $+q$, the electric field at point $P$ (outside the conductor) is given by Coulomb's law:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is irrelevant because the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge and the distance $L$, not on the cavity's geometry.
   - **Option B**: Matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is also irrelevant for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option D**: Involves $l^2$, which incorrectly suggests that the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center determines the field, rather than the distance $L$ to the conductor's center.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
