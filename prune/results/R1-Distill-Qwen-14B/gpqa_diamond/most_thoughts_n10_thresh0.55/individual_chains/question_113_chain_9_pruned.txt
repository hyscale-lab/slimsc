Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the scenario is that I've prepared an unknown compound and used three characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The data from each of these is given, and I have to determine the chemical formula from the options provided. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Let me break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR spectrum: A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching. So maybe the compound has an alcohol group or a carboxylic acid or something with an -OH group. Also, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, I think the 1700 is likely a carbonyl group, like a C=O stretch. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe in conjugation, like an aromatic ring or maybe an amide? Or wait, maybe it's a carbonyl in a conjugated system, like a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, 1650 could be a C=C stretch. Because C=C double bonds typically show up around 1600-1680 cm^-1. But wait, I'm a bit confused. The 1700 is more characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like if there's a carbonyl group attached to an aromatic ring, causing the conjugation which lowers the wavenumber. Or maybe it's a C=C in an unsaturated group.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows several peaks, including ones corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound likely has a double bond. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Then, the Mass Spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I'm trying to think about what fragments would give a mass of 45. Common fragments include CH3CO+ (which is 43), but wait, 45. Alternatively, maybe a (CH2)2O group? Wait, the mass of a CH3CH2O group is 45 (12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 46? Wait, 12*2 is 24, 6 hydrogens is 6, 16 for O is 16. Total 24+6=30+16=46. Hmm, but that's 46. Alternatively, maybe a methyl group with something else. Wait, another possibility is that the fragment is a ketene group (like O=C=O?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a fragment like (CH3)CO, which would be 45? Let's calculate: CH3CO is (12+3
