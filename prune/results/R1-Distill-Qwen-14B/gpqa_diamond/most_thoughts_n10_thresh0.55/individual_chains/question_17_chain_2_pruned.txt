Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly.

The given data are: the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The temperature is 25°C, and the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. Oh wait, K is the formation constant, right? So that's the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA form the complex.

I remember that the formation constant Kf is given by Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So the formula is Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y²-]), where Y²- is the EDTA^4- ion, but in solution, I think it's usually deprotonated. But for the sake of this problem, maybe I don't need to consider the protonation states.

Wait, wait. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of the complex, [CaY²-] = 0.02 M. And we're assuming pH is ideal, so maybe the EDTA is in its proper form and doesn't affect the calculation further. Or perhaps the pH is such that EDTA is fully deprotonated, so Y^4- is the dominant species.

So the problem is to find [Ca²+], the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

The formation constant equation would be:

K_f = [CaY²-]/( [Ca²+][Y²-] )

But wait, in the solution, the Ca-EDTA is the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA. Because each CaY²- dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-? Wait, no, no. The complex is stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. But in solution, some of it would dissociate, releasing a little Ca²+ and EDTA.

Wait, but here the Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. So if it's a 1:1 complex, then the initial concentrations are [CaY²-] = 0.02 M
