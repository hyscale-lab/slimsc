Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Let's break down what I know.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for precise measurements, like radial velocity. Each has their own capabilities in terms of the brightness of the stars they can observe. From the question, ESPRESSO can handle stars with V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can go down to 16. So, a star must be brighter than 17 mag to be seen by ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 by HIRES. Wait, no—since the question says "brighter than", which in astronomy terms means less than or equal to the magnitude because lower magnitudes are brighter. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, magnitude is a bit tricky. Lower numbers mean brighter objects. So if a star is brighter than magnitude 17, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because, for example, a magnitude 16 star is brighter than a magnitude 17 star.

So, the key is that a star must have an apparent V magnitude (m_V) less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. So for a star to be detectable by both, its m_V must be <= the brighter limit of both. Since HIRES can go to 16, the star needs to be <=16 mag in V. Because if it's brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, but if it's brighter than 16 for HIRES, then it's within the range of both. Because 16 is lower than 17, so any star that's bright enough for HIRES is also bright enough for ESPRESSO. Because if m_V is 16, that's brighter than 17. So the limiting factor is HIRES's 16 mag. So any star that's m_V <=16 would be visible by both.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So m_V < 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so m_V <16. So the stars that can be seen by both must satisfy m_V <16 because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's automatically brighter than 17, so it can be seen by both.

So the first step is to compute the apparent V magnitude (m_V) for each star.

Let me look at each star:

Star1:
Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 15.5 mag
Distance from us = 10 pc.

Apparent magnitude formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is in parsecs. So, let's compute that.

d=10, so log(10/10)=log(1)=0. So m = 15.5 +0 =15.5 mag. So m_V=15.5.

Since 15.5 < 16, it's visible by both. So Star1 can be seen by both.

Star2:
RA and DEC given, but those might not matter here because the question is about magnitude. Star2's apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5 mag. So m_V=16.5. That's brighter than 16? No, because 16.5 >16. So m_V=16.5 exceeds HIRES's limit of 16. So HIRES cannot observe it. But ESPRESSO can, since 16.5 <17. So Star2 can't be detected by both.

Star3:
Absolute V magnitude: 15.5 mag. Distance:15 pc. E(B-V)=0.6 mag. Also, there's extinction (interstellar absorption) which affects the apparent magnitude. The formula for extinction (A_V) is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So A_V=3.1*0.6=1.86 mag.

So the apparent magnitude without extinction is m_0 = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for apparent magnitude includes extinction. So the observed m is m_0 + A_V.

Wait, the formula for the star's brightness is affected by distance and extinction. Let me think. The absolute magnitude is what the star would have at 10 pc, without extinction. To get apparent magnitude, we calculate how much brighter it would be at that distance, then add the extinction.

So, M = 15.5, d=15 pc.

m_0 = M + 5 log10(d/10) =15.5 +5*log(15/10). 15/10 is 1.5, log(1.5) is approximately 0.176. So 5 *0.176=0.88. So m_0=15.5 +0.88=16.38 mag.

Then, add the extinction: A_V=1.86. So m =16.38 +1.86=18.24 mag.

Wait, that's the apparent magnitude. So m_V=18.24. Which is way above 17, so ESPRESSO can't observe it. So Star3 can't be detected by either? Or wait, wait: Actually, wait. The extinction makes it dimmer, so the apparent magnitude goes up. So Star3's m_V is 18.24, which is way beyond both 17 and 16. So neither can detect it.

Wait, but wait. Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5 before extinction. Oh wait no, the given data says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag? Or no, let me recheck.

Looking back: Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Oh wait, the description says: Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6. So that's m_observed = 15.5, but with extinction.

Wait, no. Wait the apparent magnitude given is already what's observed, right? No, because the E(B-V) is the color excess, which leads to extinction. So the apparent magnitude given is the observed one, so we don't need to calculate m_0.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The question says that Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, and E(B-V)=0.6. So the given m_V is 15.5, but that's after considering extinction? Or is that the intrinsic magnitude?

Wait no, no. In astronomy, the extinction (A_V) is the amount that the apparent magnitude increases due to dust. So the observed (apparent) magnitude is the intrinsic magnitude plus extinction.

Wait, no, the formula is: m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

So if the star's m_intrinsic is 15.5, and A_V is 1.86, then m_observed would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36. Hmm, but in the question, Star3's apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5. That can't be right because if you have extinction, the observed m would be higher than the intrinsic.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's clarify.

The star's absolute magnitude is M, which is the apparent magnitude it would have at 10 pc, without extinction. When the star is at a distance d, and there's extinction A_V, the apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V.

So in Star3's case, M is 15.5, d is 15 pc, and A_V=1.86.

So m =15.5 + 5*(log(15/10)) +1.86.

log(1.5)=0.176, so 5*0.176=0.88.

So m =15.5 +0.88 +1.86 =15.5 + 2.74 =18.24 mag.

So Star3's apparent magnitude is 18.24, which is way beyond what both instruments can detect. So no, Star3 can't be detected by either.

Wait, but the question says that Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5. That must be without extinction. So perhaps the given m is 15.5, but with extinction. Or perhaps the given m is the observed one, which includes extinction. So I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Star3 has apparent V mag of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, that's confusing because if you have E(B-V), you can calculate extinction, but the apparent magnitude would have already included it. Alternatively, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic magnitude, and the extinction makes it dimmer.

Wait no, maybe the apparent magnitude as observed is 15.5, but the extinction is E(B-V)=0.6, which is the color excess. So in that case, the extinction A_V is 3.1 * E(B-V) = 1.86 mag. So the observed m is 15.5, but the intrinsic m (without extinction) would be m - A_V = 15.5 - 1.86=13.64. But I'm not sure if that matters here.

But the question is about whether the star's apparent magnitude is less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES.

Wait, the question says that Star3 has apparent V mag of 15.5, so without considering anything else, m=15.5, which is less than 16. So HIRES can observe it, and since it's also less than 17, ESPRESSO can. But wait, that's not considering the extinction. Oh, wait, no. The apparent magnitude includes any extinction. So Star3's m is 15.5, so it's visible by both.

But wait, that can't be right because the star's distance is 15 pc. Wait, no, because the apparent magnitude is given, so we don't need to compute it. The given m is the observed value. So if m is 15.5, then that's the value we use.

So Star3's m_V is 15.5. So it's within both instruments' limits.

Wait, but that can't be, because the star's absolute magnitude is 15.5, and at 15 pc, without extinction, the apparent magnitude would be M + 5 log10(15/10) =15.5 +0.88=16.38. But with extinction of 1.86, m=16.38 +1.86=18.24. So the observed m is 18.24. But the question says the apparent V is 15.5. That's conflicting. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, looking again: The question says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So the extinction is already accounted for in the apparent magnitude. So we don't need to calculate anything else. So m=15.5, which is less than 16, so detectable by both. So Star3 is a candidate.

Wait, but that can't be correct because the star's distance affects the apparent magnitude. But if the given m is 15.5, then regardless of distance and extinction, that's the value. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed under that assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps Star3's apparent magnitude is the intrinsic value, and I have to calculate the observed. But that seems unlikely because the question gives m as 15.5, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the question is presenting the apparent magnitude as what it would be without extinction, but that would be incorrect. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given m is without extinction, and I have to calculate the observed m by adding A_V.

I think the correct approach is that the given apparent V magnitude is the observed one, which already includes extinction. So for Star3, m=15.5. That's acceptable for both spectrographs. So Star3 is a candidate.

Wait, but that would mean Star3's m is 15.5, so it's within both scopes. Let's proceed.

Star4:

Absolute V mag:15.5, distance 10 pc. E(B-V)=0.4.

Compute apparent magnitude.

First, compute m_0 (without extinction): M + 5 log10(d/10) =15.5 +5 log(10/10)=15.5 +0=15.5.

Then, compute A_V =3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So m =15.5 +1.24=16.74 mag.

So m_V=16.74.

So that's higher than both 16 and 17. Wait, 16.74 is brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it (since it's brighter than 17). Wait, no. Wait, m_V is 16.74, which is less than 17. So m=16.74 <17, so ESPRESSO can observe it. But for HIRES, the limit is 16. So 16.74 is greater than 16, which means it's dimmer than what HIRES can handle. So Star4 is visible only by ESPRESSO, not by HIRES.

Wait, no, because if m is 16.74, which is less than 17, ESPRESSO can observe it (since it can go up to 17). But for HIRES, the limit is 16, so m=16.74 is beyond that. So Star4 cannot be observed by HIRES.

So Star4 can't be seen by both.

Star5:

Absolute V mag=16.5, distance=5 pc.

Compute apparent magnitude without extinction: m_0 = M +5 log10(d/10).

d=5 pc, so 5/10=0.5, log(0.5)= -0.301.

So 5 * (-0.301)= -1.505.

So m_0=16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995, approximately 15.0 mag.

What about extinction? The question doesn't mention E(B-V) for Star5, so I assume there's no extinction (E(B-V)=0). So m=15.0.

So m_V=15.0, which is less than 16, so it's within the range of both spectrographs. So Star5 can be observed by both.

So let's compile which stars can be seen by both:

Star1: m=15.5 → yes.

Star3: m=15.5 → yes.

Star5: m=15.0 → yes.

Wait, but wait. Wait, what about Star4's m=16.74? So that's not acceptable for HIRES, only ESPRESSO.

So which stars are acceptable by both?

Stars 1, 3,5: m=15.5, 15.5,15.0.

Wait, but Star1: m=15.5 → less than 16, so both can see.

Star3: m=15.5 → same.

Star5: m=15.0 → same.

But wait, I thought Star3's observed m is 15.5, but earlier calculation using distance and extinction gave m=18.24. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the data wrong. Let's re-examine Star3's data:

Question says: Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the given m is already the observed one, including extinction. So the m is 15.5. So in that case, it's acceptable for both.

But earlier calculation using M, d, and E(B-V) gave m=18.24. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the way to interpret it is that the apparent magnitude given is the observed, so without needing to compute m_0 and A_V. So for Star3, m=15.5, which is within both.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the other approach. So perhaps I'm mixing up the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is what the star would have without extinction, and we need to compute the observed m by adding A_V.

Wait, but that's not standard. Normally, the observed apparent magnitude includes extinction. So perhaps the given m is the observed value, so I don't need to calculate anything else.

So proceeding under that assumption:

Star1: m=15.5 → yes.

Star2: m=16.5 → no for HIRES.

Star3: m=15.5 → yes.

Star4: m=16.74 → no for HIRES.

Star5: m=15.0 → yes.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

But looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES, so no.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → Both can be seen by both.

Option C: Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be seen by HIRES.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

So the correct answer would be the option that includes Star3 and Star5, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about Star3, I thought the m was 18.24, but that was when I calculated it using M, d, and E(B-V). But according to the question, Star3's m is 15.5, which is acceptable. So what's the correct approach?

Ah, I think I made a mistake earlier. The question says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6. So that m is already the observed one, which includes the extinction. So I don't need to compute it again.

So Star3's m=15.5, which is within both spectrographs' limits.

So which stars are detectable by both?

Star1: yes.

Star3: yes.

Star5: yes.

Wait, but according to the options, only option B includes Star3 and Star5. So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but looking back, Star1's m is 15.5, which is less than 16, so it can be seen by both. So why isn't Star1 in the options? Because the question asks which stars can be detected with both, so multiple stars may fit.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4's m is 16.74, which is more than 16, so HIRES can't see it. So option D is incorrect.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both have m=15.5 and 15.0, so their m <16, so both can be seen by both.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.


To determine which stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes ($m_V$) of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with $m_V \leq 17$, while HIRES can observe stars with $m_V \leq 16$. Therefore, a star must have $m_V \leq 16$ to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude ($M_V$) = 15.5 mag, Distance = 10 pc.  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_V = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5
     \]  
   - $m_V = 15.5 \leq 16$, so it is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude ($m_V$) = 16.5 mag.  
   - $m_V = 16.5 > 16$, so it is not detectable by HIRES, though it is detectable by ESPRESSO.  
   - **Not detectable by both**.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude ($m_V$) = 15.5 mag, $E(B-V) = 0.6$.  
   - The question specifies that the given $m_V$ already includes extinction. Thus, $m_V = 15.5 \leq 16$, so it is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude ($M_V$) = 15.5 mag, Distance = 10 pc, $E(B-V) = 0.4$.  
   - Extinction:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_V = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) + A_V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - $m_V = 16.74 > 16$, so it is not detectable by HIRES, though it is detectable by ESPRESSO.  
   - **Not detectable by both**.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude ($M_V$) = 16.5 mag, Distance = 5 pc.  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_V = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 \cdot (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - $m_V = 15.0 \leq 16$, so it is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the options provided, the correct choice is **Star3 and Star5**.

ANSWER: B
