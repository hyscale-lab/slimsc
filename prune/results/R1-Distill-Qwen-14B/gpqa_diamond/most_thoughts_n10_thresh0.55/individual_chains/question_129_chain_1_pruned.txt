Okay, so I need to figure out which compound E is in this reaction scheme. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step. 

The question gives me a series of reactions leading from compound A to E. There are also some hints provided, which I should definitely consider. Let's go through each step and see what we can deduce.

First, the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B. 
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Then, the hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about each part.

Starting with the IR data. The IR peak for A is around 1750 cm^-1. That usually indicates a carbonyl group. So, compound A has a ketone or maybe an ester. But since the next reaction is with HCN, which typically adds to carbonyl groups, I think A is a ketone. Because esters can react with HCN too, but ketones are more straightforward in such reactions.

So, A is a cyclic ketone, perhaps. Let's think about what reaction A undergoes. Reaction with HCN gives compound B. The HCN addition to a ketone would produce a cyanohydrin. So, B would be a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

Then, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd is usually a catalyst for hydrogenation. So, the reduction of B would likely target the nitrile group. Wait, but B is a cyanohydrin, which contains an OH group and a CN group attached to adjacent carbons. So when B is hydrogenated, the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to an amine (CH2NH2?), but wait, hydrogenation of nitrile typically gives an amine. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation that reduces the triple bond in the nitrile. Wait, nitriles can be hydrogenated to primary amines, but sometimes other conditions might produce different products. Alternatively, maybe the conditions here reduce the nitrile to an amine.

Wait, but in the presence of Pd and H2, maybe it's a hydrogenation that adds hydrogen across the triple bond. So, the nitrile (RCN) becomes RCH2NH2? Or perhaps RCH2NH2 is an amine, but more likely, the nitrile group is converted into a methylene group. Wait, no, that's usually with something like LiAlH4. Wait, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds. So, nitrile (RCN) becomes RCH2NH2? Or maybe it's more likely to reduce the nitrile to an amine, but I'm a bit fuzzy here.

Wait, wait, maybe I should think about the structure. If A is a cyclic ketone, like cyclopentanone, then B would be the cyanohydrin, which is a cyclopentane ring with an OH and CN on adjacent carbons. Then, upon hydrogenation, the CN (which is a nitrile group) would be hydrogenated to a CH2NH2 group? Or perhaps under hydrogenation, the nitrile is reduced to an amine. But knowing that H2 and Pd usually add hydrogen across double bonds, perhaps in this case, the nitrile is being hydrogenated to a primary amine. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation reduces the ketone in compound A? But no, because A is already the starting material; B is the product of A + HCN. So, the ketone in A would have reacted with HCN to form B, which is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile adjacent.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of B. Let's imagine A is cyclopentanone. Then, when HCN adds, it would form a cyanohydrin. So, structure would be (cyclopentyl with an OH and CN on adjacent carbons). Then, when B is hydrogenated under H2 and Pd, the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced. But how? Nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines. For example, RCN + H2 â†’ RCH2NH2. Alternatively, if the hydrogenation is under different conditions, maybe it becomes an amine group. So, the CN becomes CH2NH2? Or maybe the reaction adds H across the triple bond to form a single bond, so CN becomes CH2NH2, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is reduced to a methylene group, but that's more like Li
