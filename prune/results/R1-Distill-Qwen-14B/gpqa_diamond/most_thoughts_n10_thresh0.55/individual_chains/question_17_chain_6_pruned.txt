Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? They assume the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The K here is the formation constant, right? So the K represents the stability of the complex. A high K like 5e10 means the complex is very stable.

The formula for the formation constant K is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in solution, the EDTA is usually in different protonated forms. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal. So maybe the EDTA is fully deprotonated, which is the Y^4- form. That simplifies things because then [EDTA^4-] is just the concentration of free EDTA.

Wait, but in the solution, the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M. So initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But we're to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Hmm, so the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But because K is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So [Ca²+] should
