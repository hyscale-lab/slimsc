Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question involves finding probabilities and the average value of an operator for a given quantum state. Alright, I'll need to think through each step carefully.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, wait, I remember that when a state is proportional to something, it means it's equal up to a normalization constant. So I should probably normalize this state to make sure it's a valid quantum state, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the state must satisfy <alpha|alpha> = 1.

Wait, but the question doesn't mention the normalization yet. Let me think. The state is given as proportional, so I need to find the normalization factor. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So the normalization factor would be the inverse of the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients' magnitudes.

So the coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down>. Let me compute their magnitudes squared. The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), so squared is 2. Similarly, for (2 - i), the magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So the total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Alright, next, the operator whose matrix representation is given. The matrix A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so it's a 2x2 matrix. Let me think about the structure. Since it's 2x2, the basis is |up> and |down>. 

So, for a 2x2 matrix, the positions are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). So when i equals j, A_ij is 0. When i != j, it's ħ/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0     ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0  ]

Hmm, wait, that's correct. So the operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal elements. What kind of operator is this? It looks like it's similar to the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix? Because if we have sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], then A = (ħ/2) sigma_x.

So the eigenstates of this operator A would be the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are |+x> and |-x>, right? Because sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, which has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, but the question says, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, and the state |alpha> is expressed in the computational (z) basis. So to find the probabilities, I can express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, and then the coefficients' magnitudes squared will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize operator A, find its eigenstates, and then project |alpha> onto those eigenstates to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, and the eigenstates are known, maybe I can compute the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, let's think about the eigenstates of sigma_x. The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and the |-x> state is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The eigenstates of sigma_x are:

|+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2)

But wait, in our case, the basis is |up> and |down>, which correspond to the spin-up and spin-down states along z, so I think |0> here is |down>, and |1> is |up>, or maybe the other way around. Wait, no, actually, the standard notation is |up> is |+z>, which is (1,0), and |down> is |-z>, which is (0,1). So the sigma_x eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), multiplied by 1/sqrt(2), right?

Yes, because sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the states. So:

sigma_x |up> = |down>
sigma_x |down> = |up>

So the eigenstates would be:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So I can write |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A. Because the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the magnitude of the inner product between the state and the eigenstate.

So the state |alpha> is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

And the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So to find the probabilities, I need to compute < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >, then take their magnitudes squared.

Let me compute < +x | alpha > first.

< +x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Multiplying these out, the inner product becomes:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

But since <up|up> = 1, <down|down> = 1, and <up|down> = <down|up> =0.

So it simplifies to:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)*1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Simplify the numerator: 1 + 2 =3, i -i =0. So 3.

So < +x | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(14) )

The magnitude squared is (3^2)/( (sqrt(14))^2 ) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Hmm, but wait, the options have 0.64 as one of the options, so that's approximately 9/14 ≈ 0.6428. So that's about 0.64, which would correspond to 9/14, which is 0.642857.

Then, the probability of the other eigenstate, which is |-x>, would be 1 minus that, since probabilities must add to 1. So 1 - 9/14 =5/14 ≈0.357, which is approximately 0.36. So that's 5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. So that's close. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I computed < +x | alpha >, I considered the expansion. Let me go through it again.

The inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Because when you multiply <up| with |up> and |down>, you get (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 -i)/sqrt(7) each multiplied by 1, but wait, wait a second: the coefficients of |up> and |down> in |alpha> are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2-i)/sqrt(7} respectively.

So < +x | alpha > is [ (1/sqrt(2)) (1 + 0i) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Wait, because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so when you take the inner product with |alpha>, you have:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Adding (1+i) and (2 -i): 1+2=3, i -i =0. So 3.

So it's 3/( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ) = 3/sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is (3^2)/(14) )= 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Similarly, for < -x | alpha >, which is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the numerator is (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 -2 +i +i = (-1 + 2i).

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14 ≈0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. So 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. But wait, option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which don't match. Option B is 0.54 and 0.46, which don't match either. Option C is 0.28 and 0.72, which seems opposite. So option A has these probabilities.

Now, the second part of the question: the average value of operator A. The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, the average value can be found using the expectation value formula.

But since we've diagonalized A in the |+x> and |-x> basis, the average value would be sum ( eigenvalue * probability ), right?

Wait, the operator A is given by (ħ/2) sigma_x. Sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The average value would then be ( +ħ/2 ) * (9/14) + ( -ħ/2 ) * (5/14 ).

Calculating that: (9/14 -5/14 ) * ħ/2 = (4/14) * ħ/2 = (2/7) * ħ/2 = (2/7)*(1/2) ) ħ = (1/7) ħ.

Wait, that would be ħ/7. But wait, let me compute that again.

Plus: (9/14) * (ħ/2) = (9 ħ)/(28)
Minus: (5/14) * (-ħ/2) )= (5 ħ)/(28)
Wait, no, because the second term is (5/14) * (-ħ/2) = (-5 ħ)/(28).

So total average is (9 ħ/28) + (-5 ħ/28 )= (4 ħ)/(28 )= ħ/7.

So average value is ħ/7. So looking at the options, option A gives average hbar/7, and the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36. So that would be option A.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because A is the operator with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 when i !=j, else 0. So A is indeed (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So its eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1).

So the average would be (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) )= [ (9 -5 )/(14 *2) ] ħ = (4/(28)) ħ = (1/7) ħ. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A's average is hbar /7, but option D is 2 hbar/sqrt(7), which is about 0.755 hbar. So Option A's average is ħ/7, which is about 0.1428 ħ.

So the correct answer would have the probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and the average hbar/7. So looking back at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7, which matches.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again about the average value. Another approach is to compute <alpha| A |alpha> directly.

So operator A has matrix elements:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0 ] ]

The state |alpha> is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

So in vector form, the state can be written as a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So to compute <alpha| A |alpha>, it's equal to the vector multiplied by A multiplied by the conjugate transpose of the vector.

So let me compute it:

Let me denote the state vector as v = [ a, b ]^T, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), and b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Compute v† A v, where † is the conjugate transpose.

So v† is [ a*, b* ].

So v† A v = [ a*, b* ] * [ [0, ħ/2], [ ħ/2, 0 ] ] * [ a; b ]

Multiplying the matrices:

First, multiply A by v:

A * v = [ 0*a + (ħ/2)*b, (ħ/2)*a + 0*b ]^T = [ (ħ/2)*b, (ħ/2)*a ]^T.

Then, v† (A v) = [ a*, b* ] * [ (ħ/2) b, (ħ/2) a ].

Which is a* (ħ/2) b + b* (ħ/2) a.

= (ħ/2) [ a* b + b* a ].

Hmm, but a* b + b* a = 2 Re( a* b ) = 2 (a* b + b* a ) /2, which is the real part.

So the average value is (ħ/2) * 2 Re( a* b ), which is (ħ) Re( a* b ).

So compute a* b: a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), so a* is (1-i)/sqrt(7). b is (2-i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = [ (1 -i)(2 - i) ] / (7).

Multiply (1 -i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2*(-i)
Wait, no, more carefully:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i +i²
= 2 -3i + (-1) [since i² = -1]
= (2-1) -3i = 1 -3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

Then Re( a* b ) is the real part, which is 1/7.

So the average value is ħ * (1/7) = ħ/7. So that's the same result as before.

So the average is indeed ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.642857 (0.64) and 5/14≈0.357 (0.36), and the average is ħ/7. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Yes, that's correct.


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined. The state of the electron is given as proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The state is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the magnitudes of the coefficients:
- Magnitude of \( 1+i \): \( \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2} \), so \( (1+i)^2 = 2 \).
- Magnitude of \( 2-i \): \( \sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{5} \), so \( (2-i)^2 = 5 \).

The total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \). Thus, the normalization factor is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \), and the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Matrix representation of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) for \( i = j \). In the \( z \)-basis, this matrix is:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, \( \sigma_x \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \). The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The probabilities are given by the squared magnitudes of the inner products of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). Compute these inner products:
1. \( \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \):
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{3}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The magnitude squared is:
\[
|\langle +x|\alpha\rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.642857.
\]

2. \( \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \):
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The magnitude squared is:
\[
|\langle -x|\alpha\rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{1^2 + 2^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357143.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by \( \langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle \). Using the fact that \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), the eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The average value is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) \cdot \text{Prob}(|+x\rangle) + \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) \cdot \text{Prob}(|-x\rangle).
\]
Substitute the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{9}{14} + \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{5}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
