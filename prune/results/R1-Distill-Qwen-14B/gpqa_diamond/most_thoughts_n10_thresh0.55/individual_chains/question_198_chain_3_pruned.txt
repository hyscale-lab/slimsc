Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us about the tendency of a metal ion to form a complex with ligands. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The question says we have a Co(II) solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, wait, no. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands. So Co(SCN)_2^2+ is the complex with two SCN- ions. So the β2 is 40, right? Because βn is for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is for CoSCN^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^2+, β3 for Co(SCN)_3^3+, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4^4-.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species. So I think blue refers to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. Or maybe I should check the color of different complexes? But I don't remember the exact colors. Anyway, the problem is asking for the concentration fraction of the β2 complex.

To find the percentage, I'll need to calculate the distribution of cobalt species based on their stability constants. The general approach is to consider all possible complexes and find their concentrations relative to each other.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is related to the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligands. The fraction for each species is given by (β_i * [SCN^-]^i) / (sum over all j of β_j * [SCN^-]^j )

Wait, but there's also the free ion Co^2+ to consider. So all the species are: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}, [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-}.

So the total concentration of Co is the sum of all these species. The problem gives the total Co concentration as 0.01 M. The SCN- concentration is 0.1 M.

The fraction of each species (f_i) is [Co(SCN)_i]^(2−i) / [Total Co].

The fraction f_i is given by (β_i * [SCN^-]^i) / (sum over k from 0 to 4 of (β_k [SCN^-]^k)) )

Wait, because for each complex, the concentration is [Co^2+] multiplied by β_i and [SCN^-]^i. So the total is [Co^2+] (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + ...?) Hmm, no, I think each term is β_i [SCN^-]^i. So the denominator is the sum of all β_k [SCN^-]^k for k from 0 to 4 (but
