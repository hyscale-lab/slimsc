Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which I guess means it's at a suitable level for the EDTA to function properly. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is a complex ion, so the problem is probably about dissociation. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So if the complex dissociates, it goes into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- or something like that.

Wait, but the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Then, at equilibrium, some of it will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA. The K value is given, which is the formation constant, Kf. So Kf is [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, wait. No, wait. Formation constant Kf is for the formation of the complex from the ions. So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. And Kf is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

So in this problem, we have a solution where the CaEDTA²- is 0.02 M. But wait, no, because it's a solution containing the stoichiometric complex. So perhaps all the Ca and EDTA is tied up in the complex? Or maybe not. Wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, in a solution where you have a chelating agent like EDTA, if you add a metal ion, they form a complex. But in this case, the solution already has the complex. So perhaps the complex is dissociating a little, releasing some Ca²+ and EDTA.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's assume that x amount dissociates. So, the concentration of Ca²+ would be x, and
