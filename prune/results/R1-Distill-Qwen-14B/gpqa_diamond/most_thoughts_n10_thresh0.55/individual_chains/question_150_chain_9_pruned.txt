Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a molecular formula with 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. 

Looking at the NMR data: 
- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Triplett might be due to coupling with two adjacent protons. Wait, but aldehyde is usually a singlet because it's at the end. Hmm, maybe not an aldehyde? Or maybe it's a conjugated system affecting it. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH in an amide? But wait, the formula has one N and one O. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with something else.

Other NMR signals:
- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably aromatic protons next to substituents like a nitro group or something else.
- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Another aromatic set. Maybe this is a para-substituted benzene ring.
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchangeable protons, like an OH group. But 2H? Hmm, maybe a di-substituted aromatic ring or maybe two aromatic rings each with an OH group. Or maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative group.
- 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably a methylene group next to an electronegative atom, maybe an oxygen. Like OCHâ‚‚.

So putting this together. The formula C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, X=0, N=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2. Let's compute: (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees: could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring (maybe another ring or another double bond). Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring and a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, the NMR has an aldehyde peak? Or maybe not. The first peak at 9.72 is a triplet. Aldehyde protons are usually singlet, but if adjacent to something else, maybe a coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like from a phenol. Wait, but phenols are around 5 ppm, unless they are strongly deshielded. But 9.72 is quite upfield for a phenol. Wait, no, actually, that's really downfield. Phenol protons are usually around 6-7, maybe a bit higher if deprotonated, but under acidic conditions, maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide proton? But amide protons are usually around 8-9, but they are usually broad. But in the NMR, it's a triplet, so maybe not.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 9.72 is an aldehyde. But then why a triplet? Maybe it's part of a conjugated system.
