Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex (which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+?) among all Co species.

Wait, stability constants (β) tell us about the stability of the complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the complexes with higher β values will form more.

I remember that the fraction of each species can be found using the stability constants. The general approach is to calculate the concentration of each complex relative to the others and then sum them up to find the percentage.

Let me outline the possible complexes:

Co^2+ (free ion)
[Co(SCN)]^+ (β1=9)
[Co(SCN)_2]^0 (β2=40)
[Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63)
[Co(SCN)_4]^2- (β4=16)

Wait, but wait, what's the charge here? Co^2+ with n SCN- which are -1 each. So:

n=0: Co^2+ → charge +2.
n=1: Co^2+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)]^+ → charge +1.
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → neutral.
n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- → -1.
n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- → -2.

So the complexes go from n=0 to n=4.

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which would be the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex. So that's the n=2 case.

To find the fraction of each complex, I think I need to use the formula for the distribution of metal complexes based on stability constants. The fraction f_n is given by (β_n * [SCN]^n) / (denominator), where the denominator is the sum from k=0 to 4 of (β_k * [SCN]^k).

Wait, but wait, the denominator would actually be the sum of all possible complexes, including the free ion. So the total concentration is the sum of all species: Co^2+ + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Each of these species can be expressed in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration, which I'll call [Co^2+], multiplied by the corresponding β and the [SCN]^n term. So for each species, concentration = [Co^2+] * β_n * [SCN]^n.

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all these, so:

Total Co = [Co^2+] + [Co^2+]*β1*[SCN] + [Co^2+]*β2*[SCN]^2 +
