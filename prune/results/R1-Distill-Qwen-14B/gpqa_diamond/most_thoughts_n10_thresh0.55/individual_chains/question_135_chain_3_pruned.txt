Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question is about the allowed decay products of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure how crucial that is right now.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I should parse this. It looks like it's an interaction term between the boson X and some fermion ψ_f. The structure seems to involve Yukawa coupling since it's similar to the Yukawa interaction form, which is something like λ ψ† ψ X. So Yukawa coupling implies that the boson X is mediating a force between fermions.

But wait, the Yukawa coupling would typically be between a scalar field (like X) and fermions. So the interaction term here suggests that X can couple to fermions. So the decay products would be pairs of fermions, right? Because bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

But wait, the options given are about which fermion pairs are allowed. So the possible decay modes would be into pairs of particles and their antiparticles. The question is, which of these pairs can the boson X decay into, kinematically?

Kinematical allowance depends on the mass of X compared to the mass of the fermions involved. Each decay product pair must satisfy the condition that their combined mass is less than the
