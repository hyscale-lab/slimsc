Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Alright, let's read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. I'm supposed to find out how the number of stars changes with distance r, per unit range of distance. The options are A to D, with different powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance (in parsecs), so plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. So if r increases, plx decreases, and vice versa.

Wait, so if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then plx = 1/r. So substituting that into the equation: N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. 

1 divided by (1/r)^5 is the same as (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases as r^5. But wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. Wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. It says "varies with parallax as 1/plx^5". So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, substitute: N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5 = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question isn't directly asking for N as a function of r. It's asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm, so it's about the rate of change. Oh, wait, no, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of stars in a shell at distance r. Because usually, when we talk about the number of stars as a function of distance, we think of how many are there in a thin shell at r, which would be dN/dr. Or maybe the number per unit volume, but I'm not sure.

The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." So per unit distance. So perhaps it's the differential: dN/dr. Because that would represent how many more stars there are when you move a small distance dr. So if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5r^4, which is r^4. But wait, looking at the options, one of them is r^4, which is option C. So in that case, the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not getting confused. The question says the number varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But plx = 1/r. So N ∝ (r)^5.

But N is the number of stars in the region. So if we have a certain area (like a specific region of the sky), the number of stars depends on r^5. So as r increases, more stars are present? Is that realistic? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because as you go further away, stars should appear less dense. Wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So higher parallax means closer distance. So if the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, that means that as parallax increases (which is as distance decreases), the number of stars increases. So for closer distances, more stars.

But wait, in the real universe, the number of stars actually increases with distance up to a point because more stars are present in the galaxy in certain regions. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The question seems to be a mathematical relation, not based on real distribution.

So back to the problem. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/r, then N is proportional to r^5. So for a given region of the sky, the number of stars increases with r^5 as you go further out. But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So if I think of it as a function of r, dN/dr would be the change per unit distance. So if N = K * r^5, then dN/dr = 5K r^4. So dN/dr is proportional to r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. What's the exact relation between parallax and distance here? Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1 / r, where r is in parsecs. So yes, r = 1/plx.

So, N ∝ 1/plx^5 = (r)^5. So N as a function of r is r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So when you increase the distance by a small amount dr, how does the number change? That would be the derivative, dN/dr, which is 5r^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is directly asking for N as a function of r, not the derivative. Let me re-read the question. It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." Hmm, "per unit range" might imply the rate of change, which is the derivative. So the answer would be r^4, option C.


The question states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax \( \text{plx} \) as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance (\( \text{plx} = 1/r \), where \( r \) is in parsecs), substituting \( \text{plx} = 1/r \) into the relation gives:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{(1/r)^5} = r^5.
\]

This shows that the number of stars \( N \) increases with \( r^5 \) as distance \( r \) increases. However, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance," which implies the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), i.e., \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4.
\]

Thus, the number of stars changes with distance per unit range as \( r^4 \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**.

Answer: C
