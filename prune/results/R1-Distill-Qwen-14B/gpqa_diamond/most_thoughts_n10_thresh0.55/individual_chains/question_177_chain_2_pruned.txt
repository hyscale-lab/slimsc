Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the luminosities of two stars, their sizes, masses, and some other data. Alright, let's try to unpack this.

So the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh right, radius is R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 M2. But wait, I'm not sure if the mass comes into play here. The question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. The peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same too, because λ is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait. The problem says they computed the luminosity using the blackbody radiation, so I think that's the key here. Luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures T are the same. Because λ_max is the same, so T1 = T2. So T cancels out in the luminosity ratio.

So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, that ratio becomes (R1² / R2²) = (1.5 R2)² / R2² = 2.25. So the luminosity should be 2.25 times larger for Star_1.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, right, radial velocity would affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But the problem says that through spectroscopy, they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which are the same. So that observed λ
