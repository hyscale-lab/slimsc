Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, which is Ay, is a 2x2 matrix given by c times S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S has the form with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and used for spin-1/2 systems. The S here probably relates to one of them. Let me see, the given S matrix is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Wait, isn't that the same as the Pauli Y matrix? No, the Pauli Y matrix usually has a different sign. Let me recall: the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The Y matrix is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the standard Pauli Y matrix is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]? Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up. No, wait: the standard σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches the given S matrix. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, σy.

So Ay = c * S = (h/4π) * σy. Oh, but wait, sometimes the Pauli matrices are written with a factor. Let me think: the spin angular momentum operator S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Oh right, because for an electron (or muon, which is a lepton like electron), the spin is 1/2 ħ. So S = (ħ/2) σ.

Wait, but here c is h/(4π). Let me compute h in terms of ħ. We know that ħ = h/(2π). So c = h/(4π) = (h/(2π)) * (1/(2)) ) → c = ħ * (1/2). So c = ħ/2.

Ah, so Ay = (ħ/2) σy. Because
