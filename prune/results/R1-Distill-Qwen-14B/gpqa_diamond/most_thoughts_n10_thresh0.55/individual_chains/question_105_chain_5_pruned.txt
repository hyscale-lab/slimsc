Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. The problem says that when only one hemisphere is spotted, the photometric observations (which measure brightness over time) show periodic brightness variations because the star is rotating, modulating the spots into our view. This setup can mimic the presence of an exoplanet in terms of the light curve.

The main question is: To produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve (without any spots), what should the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet be relative to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar)?

The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm. So I think I need to compare the light variations caused by the spots to those caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

First, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2. So the amplitude of the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, which is the fractional change in brightness.

But in this case, the star has spots. The observed variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. So, when the spots are on the side facing us, they block some of the light. But wait, the spots are cooler, so when they're on the front, the total brightness is lower, and when they're on the back, the star appears brighter. But wait, no, actually, when the spot is facing us, the star's brightness decreases because that part is darker. So the star's brightness varies as the spots rotate, causing a dip when the spot is in view.

Wait, but the star is only spotted on one hemisphere. So the spots are on one side. As the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing the brightness to dip each time the spot is facing us.

But wait, the problem says that this situation closely resembles the presence of an exoplanet. So the brightness variation from the spots should be similar to the dip caused by a planet. So I need to calculate what the equivalent planet radius would be to get the same dip.

So, first, I'll model the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, I'll find the equivalent planet radius that would cause the same dip.

Let's start with the star's parameters.

The star has a radius Rstar = R_sun.

The spots cover a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, a hemisphere's area is (1/2) * 4π R^2 = 2π R^2. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

But wait, that's the area on the entire hemisphere? Or per hemisphere? No,
