Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but let me try to break it down.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame observer.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer. And the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So both the glass and the light are moving towards the observer. Or wait, no, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and the beam is going toward the observer. Oh, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light inside is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the light's direction is towards the observer, same as the glass's movement.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about frames of reference. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed c/n because of the index of refraction. Wait, no—wait, the speed of light in the medium is c divided by n. So in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c_prime = c/n.

But now, since the glass is moving, I need to apply a velocity transformation. Like, using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because when objects are moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add linearly—it's more complicated.

Wait, but wait. Is this a relativistic situation? The problem says the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1, so perhaps they're using units where c=1. So in the glass frame, the light speed is 1/n.

Wait, but velocity addition in relativity is given by (u + v) / (1 + u*v), where u is the velocity in the moving frame and v is the speed of the moving frame relative to the lab. But wait, no—wait, the formula is (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c²) when transforming from a frame moving at speed v relative to the lab. Oh, but in this case, since the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, which is the lab frame.

Wait, but the light's velocity in the glass frame is u' = c/n, but wait, no
