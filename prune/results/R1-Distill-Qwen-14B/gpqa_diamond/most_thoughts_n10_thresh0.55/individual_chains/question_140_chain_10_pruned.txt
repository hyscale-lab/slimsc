Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see if I can break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms.

Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. I think I remember that in organic reactions, things like Grignard reagents or maybe something else come into play. Hmm.

Let me start by thinking about the gas W first. The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. That likely means it's a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Wait, but a molecule is made of atoms, so each atom has its own protons and neutrons. Or maybe the entire molecule has the same number of each?

Wait, the problem says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." Oh, so for each molecule, the total number of neutrons equals the total number of protons. So, for example, if the molecule is H2O, it has 2 H and 1 O. H has 1 proton each, so 2. O has 8 protons. So total protons would be 10. Neutrons: H has 0 each (assuming protium), O has 8 neutrons. So total neutrons would be 8. 10 vs 8; not equal.

Hmm, maybe the molecule is something like NH3. Wait, let's see: Each N atom has 7 protons, 7 neutrons (if it's NH3, using N-14, which is 7 protons and 7 neutrons), and H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So total for the molecule: 7 (N) + 3(1) = 10 protons. Neutrons: 7 (N) + 3(0) =7. So 10 vs 7, not equal.

Wait, maybe it's a molecule where each atom contributes equally, but perhaps a diatomic molecule. Let me think of diatomic gases. CO2 isn't diatomic. Maybe O2? O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's O-16). Each O in O2 would have 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule has 16 protons (8*2) and 16 neutrons (8*2). So 16 each, which satisfies the condition. So W could be O2. But when would that form? If X reacts with Y to produce O2, but O2 is a gas. Alternatively, maybe it's another diatomic, like H2. H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. So no, that doesn't fit. Or maybe CO? Wait, CO has 29 protons (C:6 + O:8 =14?), wait no, CO is C (6 protons) and O (8), so 14 protons in total. Neutrons: C has 6 (if 12C), O has 8 (16O), so 14 neutrons. So 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That fits! So W could be CO. But then, where does CO fit into the reaction?

Wait, but the reaction is between X and Y, producing W. What are X and Y?

Alternatively, maybe W is CH4? No, that doesn't fit. Let's think again.

Wait another approach: Maybe the molecule is a noble gas, like Ar. Ar has 18 protons and 22 neutrons, but that doesn't fit. Or maybe it's a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: What about H2O? For H2O, assuming H is protium (1 proton, 0 neutron), O is 16O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 2*1 +8=10. Neutrons: 2*0 +8=8. 10â‰ 8, so no.

Hmm, perhaps the molecule is C2H4O2? No, that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's something like O3. O3 would have each O as 8 protons, so 3*8=24 protons. Neutrons would be 3 *8=24 (if each O is 16O). So 24 each. That fits. So W could be O3.

But wait, in that case, how would X and Y react to produce O3? That's not a common reaction. I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The problem says that when G is heated, it releases
