Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet is more likely to transit so that the researchers should observe that one. The options are Planet_1 and Planet_2, but I have to determine which has a higher probability of transiting based on the given information.

First, let me recall what factors affect the probability of a planet transiting its star. The transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. A smaller orbital plane (closer to edge-on) increases the chance. But wait, the RV method detects planets through their Doppler shift, which doesn't depend on the inclination—so they might have a range of inclinations. Wait, but the transit method requires the orbit to be edge-on. So the probability is higher if the planet's orbit is more likely to align edge-on.

I think the transit probability is given by R_star / a, where R_star is the stellar radius and a is the orbital separation (semi-major axis). But wait, no, that's the approximate depth of the transit. The actual probability is more about the geometry—how likely the planet's orbit is to cross our line of sight.

Wait, the probability P that a planet transits is approximately (R_star / a), but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R*/a), and it's multiplied by another factor if the orbital period is considered. Or wait, maybe the probability is (R*/a) multiplied by some function of the stellar density and the planet's orbital period.

Oh right, the transit probability formula can be derived from the geometry. The planet's
