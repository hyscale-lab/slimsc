Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because symmetry in molecules isn't my strongest suit. But let's take it step by step.

The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. I remember that C3h symmetry involves a combination of a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane. Wait, no, wait. C3h is actually a point group. Let me get this right. The point groups... C3h is the same as the D3h group in some contexts, but wait, no. Actually, I think the point group C3h consists of a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). But sometimes, C3h isn't a standard point group because when you have a C3 axis and a mirror plane, the combination can lead to higher symmetry. Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible structures of each molecule and their symmetry.

The options are:
A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I think I should look at each structure one by one.

Starting with triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate has the formula (i-Pr)3BO. The structure is like a central boron atom with three isopropyl groups attached. Each isopropyl group is a CH(CH3)2. So the molecule is symmetric because all three substituents are the same. The central boron is surrounded by three identical groups. So this would have a trigonal planar geometry, right? So the symmetry should be at least C3. Wait, but what about the mirror planes? If all three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically, there might be multiple mirror planes. So maybe this molecule has higher symmetry, like D3h or something. Wait, but C3h is a lower symmetry. Hmm.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule; it's a norbornane derivative. Its structure is a bridge with two rings. Wait, nor
