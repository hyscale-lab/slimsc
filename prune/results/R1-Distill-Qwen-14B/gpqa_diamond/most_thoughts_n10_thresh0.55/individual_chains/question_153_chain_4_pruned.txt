Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The reaction typically forms a new carbon-carbon bond.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol as the conditions. I think dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a nucleophile. The other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor.

In the Michael addition, the enolate of the donor (dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. Wait, wait. Dimethyl malonate, when deprotonated, forms an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. The methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has a structure like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Wait, I think the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=C(CO2Me)-p-tolyl? No, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OAc? Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Hmm, maybe I should visualize it. The acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the substituent at position 3. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense because acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3
