Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogens and oxygens.

Let me jot down what each spectroscopy tells me.

First, the FTIR. The peaks are at 3000 (very broad), 1700, and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, I remember that the broad peak around 3000 is probably O-H from an alcohol or maybe a carbonyl group. Wait, no, carbonyls are higher. Oh wait, no, the broad peak is more likely due to an -OH group, like in an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300. So a very broad peak at 3000 would fit that. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but the broadness might suggest something else.

Then, the peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. Wait, a carboxylic acid usually has a strong peak around 1700, but earlier, the 1650 might be another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic C=O or something else. Wait, or maybe it's an ester or a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, 1650 could be an aromatic ring with C=C stretching. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: 1700 is a carbonyl. 1650 could be either another carbonyl (maybe a conjugated or another type) or an aromatic ring. If it's an aromatic ring, say, with a substituent causing conjugation, then maybe a C=C in the ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an enone system, where the carbonyl is conjugated to a double bond.

Next, the 1
