Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma equal to 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, rhombohedral crystal... Oh right, a rhombohedral system is a type of crystal system where all edges are of equal length, but the angles between them are not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, all angles are 30 degrees. So it's a special case of a hexagonal crystal system, perhaps?

I think the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of (h² + k² + l²) times some factors involving the structure and the angles. But wait, for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), where a is the lattice parameter. But here, it's a rhombohedral system, so the formula must be more complicated.

Rhombohedral systems have a basis that's more complex. Oh, right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) )

Wait, but in this case, all angles are 30 degrees. Also, because all edges a, b, c are equal in a rhombohedral system, so a = b = c. Let me denote this common length as 'a'. So interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Hmm, wait, wait. The interatomic distance is the distance between atoms in the crystal. For a simple cubic system, the interatomic distance would just be the lattice parameter a. Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the situation might be different because of the angles.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. I'm getting confused here. The interatomic distance in a crystal is the distance between neighboring atoms. In a simple cubic structure, it's same as the lattice parameter. But in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance would actually be the same as the lattice
