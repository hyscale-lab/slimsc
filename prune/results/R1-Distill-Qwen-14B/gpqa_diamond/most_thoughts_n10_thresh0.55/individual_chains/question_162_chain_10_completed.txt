Okay, so I'm looking at this metric and trying to figure out the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, wait, what's a pseudosphere again? Oh right, it's like a surface with constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape but more extreme. So, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). 

Wait, I remember that in general relativity, the metric can tell us about the geometry of the space. The area element in such a case would be the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy or something like that. But wait, in this case, the metric is conformally flat, meaning it's just a scaling factor times the flat metric. So, the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant. 

The metric here is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the diagonal components. The scaling factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²), so each dx² and dy² are scaled by this term. The determinant of the metric tensor g would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]² because it's a 2x2 diagonal matrix with both terms equal. Therefore, the area element dA would be sqrt(g) dx dy. Let's calculate that: sqrt([32/(4 - x² - y²)]²) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

Wait, but the area of the entire pseudosphere would require integrating this over the entire x and y space where the metric is defined. What's the domain of x and y here? The denominator is 4 - x² - y². Oh, so for the denominator to be positive, 4 - (x² + y²) must be positive. That means x² + y² <4, so the radius is 2. So the domain is the interior of a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. 

So, the area is the integral over x and y of [32/(4 - r²)] times dx dy, where r² = x² + y². But wait, because we're in polar coordinates, it's easier to change variables. Let me switch to polar coordinates. So, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, dx dy = r dr dθ. 

Then, substituting, the area becomes the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2 (since the radius is 2). The integrand would be [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. Let me write that down:

Area = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

I can separate the integrals since the integrand is a product of functions of r and θ. The integral over θ is straightforward: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π. So, the area becomes 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Hmm, that integral might be tricky. Let's compute the integral ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r², then du/dr = -2r, so (-1/2) du = r dr. 

Wait, so 32 r dr = 32 * (-1/2) du = -16 du. So, substituting, the integral becomes ∫ (-16) / u du. The limits of integration: when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 - (2)^2 = 0. So the integral goes from u=4 to u=0. 

So it's ∫ (from u=4 to 0) (-16)/u du. Which is the same as ∫ (from 0 to 4) (16)/u du because flipping the limits removes the negative sign. So, 16 ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4. 

Wait, but ∫ (1/u) du is ln|u| + C. So evaluating from 0 to4 gives ln(4) - ln(0). Oh wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So this integral diverges. Because as u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln(u) approaches -infty. So 16 [ ln(4) - (-infty) ] → 16 * infty = infty. 

So the area is 2π multiplied by (infty), which is infinite. So the area of the pseudosphere is infinite. 

Wait, but pseudospheres have finite area, right? Or do they? Hmm, no, wait. Wait, a pseudosphere is an infinite surface, so its area might be infinite. Or does this particular metric represent a finite area? Let me think again. 

Wait, the metric is given for r² = x² + y² <4, but in this case, the area integral is over r from 0 to 2. But because of the 1/(4 - r²) factor, which blows up as r approaches 2, the area becomes infinite. So the area is infinite, so the answer is D) +infty.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is +infty, which matches. So that's probably the correct answer.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). To compute the area of the pseudosphere, we calculate the area element \(dA\) using the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is conformally flat, the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The domain of \(x\) and \(y\) is restricted by the condition \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\), which implies \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). This corresponds to a circle of radius \(2\) in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. To find the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over this domain. Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \(\theta\) is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Thus, the area reduces to:

\[
\text{Area} = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(-\frac{1}{2} du = r \, dr\). The limits of integration change as follows: when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\); when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

As \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is:

\[
\text{Area} = +\infty.
\]

From the options, the correct answer is:
