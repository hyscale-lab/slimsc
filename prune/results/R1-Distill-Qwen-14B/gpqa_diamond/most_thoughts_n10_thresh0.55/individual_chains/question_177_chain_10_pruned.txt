Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s, respectively. The question is about the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what I know. The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, right? So the formula is L = 4πR²σT^4, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but the problem says both stars have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same, right? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2, because λ1 = λ2.

Wait, is that correct? Because if the stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2. Oh, that's a key point. So both stars are at the same temperature.

So now, since T is the same for both, the luminosity ratio can be found using the radii and the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Let's write the formula for each star.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T^4
L2 = 4π R2² σ T^4

So when we take the ratio L1/L2, the 4π and σ and T^4 terms will cancel out because they're the same for both. So L1/L2 = (R1²) / (R2²)

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1 = 1.5 R2

Plugging that in: ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / R2^2 = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25.

Wait, but wait. The options don't have exactly 2.25. Let me look again. Option A is ~2.25, option D is ~2.23. Hmm, but wait, I'm missing something here. Oh yeah, wait, the problem says they computed the luminosity considering their velocities. Oh, wait, no. The question says the luminosity is computed as if they're black bodies. So I think the radial velocity part is about something else, maybe the Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength, but the peak emission is intrinsic.

Wait, but the problem says the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max for both is same. So that would imply that their intrinsic temperatures are the same because the observed wavelength is their intrinsic lambda_max multiplied by a Doppler shift factor.

Wait, that's a possibility I hadn't considered.
