Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and how the number of stars relates to parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Wait, right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means a closer star, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx^5). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, the number N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. But I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range.

Wait, let me think about the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax plx is equal to 1/distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. So r = 1/plx. So plx is inversely proportional to r.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting r in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/r, then 1/plx = r. So 1/plx^5 is r^5. Oh wait, let me see: plx = 1/r → 1/plx = r → plx = r^-1. So 1/plx^5 is (r^-1)^-5 = r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait. The question says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N = k/(plx^5), where k is some constant
