Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's see what the question is about. Alright, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. 

So, from what I remember, the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. When a planet orbits a star, the star moves a little bit in the opposite direction due to the planet's gravity. This causes the spectral lines of the star to shift periodically—blue when the star is moving towards us, red when moving away. The size of this shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbit.

The setup here is that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, so I don't have to worry about eccentricity affecting the calculation.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I think the key here is understanding the relationship between the Doppler shift (which depends on the velocity of the star) and the orbital period. The Doppler shift (or the semi-amplitude of the velocity) is given by some formula. Oh right, the formula is something like:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (4π²)^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) )

Wait, maybe I should look it up in my notes. Oh right, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P * sqrt(1 - e²))) )^(1/3)

But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so the denominator becomes P^(1/3). Also, since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less than the Sun's mass), the term (1 + M_p/M_star) is approximately 1. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the simplified version of the RV formula when the planet mass is much smaller than the star's. So K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * P ) )^(1/3) ) * ... Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the proportionality.

I remember that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)) ). Because:

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * P )^(-1/3) ) * ( (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )

Since M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G * P )^(-1/3) ) * ( M_p * sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But since the inclination i is 90 degrees (edge-on) for both planets, sin i is 1. So K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

Wait, but in this problem, both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planet masses are similar. So M_p1 = M_p2 ≈ Neptune's mass, and M_star1 = M_star2 = Sun's mass. So the M_p and M_star terms are the same for both planets. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. If K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), then P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So if K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then P1 / P2 = (K2 / K1)^3.

Wait no, let's think about it. Since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then P^(1/3) ∝ 1/K → P ∝ 1/K³.

So if K1 is larger than K2, P1 would be smaller than P2. Because if K is larger, the period is shorter.

Wait, let me think again. Let me write the proportionality:

K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P^(1/3) ∝ 1/K → P ∝ (1/K)^3.

So P is inversely proportional to K cubed. So if K2 is larger than K1, P2 would be smaller than P1? Wait wait, hold on. Let me plug in the values.

In the problem, Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K2 = 7/5 K1, so K2 > K1.

So according to the proportionality, P ∝ (1/K)^3.

So P2 = (1/K2)^3 * constant, P1 = (1/K1)^3 * same constant.

So P2 / P1 = (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no. Let me write this correctly.

If K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then P ∝ (1/K)^(3).

So P = C / K^3, where C is a constant.

Therefore, P2 / P1 = ( C / K2^3 ) / ( C / K1^3 ) ) = ( K1^3 ) / ( K2^3 )

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

So the ratio of P2 to P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

In this problem, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

Therefore, (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1, meaning P2 is shorter than P1. But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1? Oh wait, no. Wait, the question says: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So the ratio is P2 / P1.

Wait, but according to the calculation, P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So it's shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which would mean P2 is 0.36 times longer than P1. No, wait, no, that would mean P2 is shorter. Wait, no, no. Wait, if P2 is 0.364 times P1, then P2 is shorter. So the period of planet #2 is only about a third of planet #1's period. Therefore, the period of planet #2 is shorter, so it's not longer. So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1, but according to the numbers, it's shorter. Hmm, but the options include 0.36 as option A. Let's check the options again.

Options:
A) ~0.36
B) ~1.40
C) ~1.96
D) ~0.85

Wait, the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long, so it's shorter. So the answer would be 0.36, but that's the ratio P2/P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, which means it's shorter. So the question is: How many times longer is P2 than P1? So the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. Let me think again: if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then if K2 is larger than K1, P2 must be smaller than P1. Because a larger K implies a smaller P. So for instance, if K doubles, P is 1/8th as much. So in this case, K2 is larger, so P2 is smaller. Therefore, P2 is shorter than P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's less than 1 times, so 0.36. So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

But wait, another thought: sometimes RV semi-amplitude K is related to the star's velocity. So K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( P^(1/3) )) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( G * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me maybe write the formula in terms of proportionality again. 

K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

But in this problem, M_p and M_star are the same for both planets. So K1 and K2 are proportional to 1/(P1^(1/3)) and 1/(P2^(1/3)) respectively.

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, because K1 ∝ 1/P1^(1/3), K2 ∝ 1/P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So to find P2/P1, we cube both sides:

( (K1/K2) )^3 = (P2/P1 )

In this problem, K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So (5/7)^3 = (P2/P1) → P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1, so the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times as long, so it's shorter. So the correct answer is option A, approximately 0.36.

Wait, but wait, the question is phrased as: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's shorter, so the period is 0.36 times as long. So the number of times longer is 0.36 times. So the answer is option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \) milliangstroms and \( K_2 = 7 \) milliangstroms, the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
