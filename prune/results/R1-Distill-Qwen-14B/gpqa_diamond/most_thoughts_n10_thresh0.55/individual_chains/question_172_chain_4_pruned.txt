Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms is described by the Boltzmann equation. Right, the equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between those levels.

The Boltzmann factor equation is something like n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Oh wait, but in this problem, the excitation is such that the ratio is 2, but it's for the same energy level in both stars. Wait, no, wait. Oh, no, wait. The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So n1 / n2 = 2, perhaps? Or maybe the excitation (the number in the higher level) is twice in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, but the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars, right? Because it's the same energy level in the iron atoms, just observed in two different stars. So ΔE is the same for both.

So the ratio of excitation (n1_upper / n1_lower) in star_1 compared to star_2 would be (n1_upper/n1_lower) / (n2_upper/n2_lower) = 2. Because star_1 has twice as excited atoms, meaning twice the excitation in that level.

Wait, or perhaps the problem says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1 = 2 n2. Or maybe it's the ratio of the populations in the same energy level, but that's probably not the case. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, so for the same energy level, the excitation (like the number of atoms in that level) is twice as high in star_1.

So let me think. The ratio of
