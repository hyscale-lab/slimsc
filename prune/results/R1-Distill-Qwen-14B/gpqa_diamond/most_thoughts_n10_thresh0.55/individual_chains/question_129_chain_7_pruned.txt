Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a reaction scheme where each step involves different reagents, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the problem carefully. So, the reaction starts with compound A. When A reacts with HCN, it forms compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Next, C reacts with HNO2 to make D, and then D loses an inert gas to form E. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct structure for E.

Looking at the hints might give me some clues. Hint a says that when compound A is treated with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, I remember that ylides are typically used in alkylation reactions, like the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent (ylide) reacts with aldehydes or ketones to form alkenes.

So, if A reacts with a ylide to form that compound, A must be a carbonyl compound. Because the Wittig reaction converts carbonyls to alkenes. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me visualize that structure. So, on a cyclopentane ring, positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups. Then, position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is like a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached. Wait, no. Propan-2-ylidene would be (CH3)2C= attached as a substituent?

Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. The product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups, and a substituent at position 4 which is a propan-2-ylidene. Propan-2-ylidene is (CH2CH2C(CH3)=?), no wait. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is (CH3)2C=CH–? Or is it the ylid part? Oh wait, the ylide is the reagent, which is R2P=CH-R'. So when the ylide reacts with A (a carbonyl), it forms an alkene.

Wait, the product after the Wittig reaction has a double bond. So perhaps the product has a ring with a substituent that's an alkene. The substituent in position 4 is a propan-2-ylidene group. Let me think: propan-2-ylidene would be (CH3)2C– as a substituent but with a double bond. So the structure at position 4 is (CH2CH(CH3)) with a double bond? Or maybe it's a cyclopentane ring with a substituent that's a propenyl group attached in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopentane ring where one of the substituents is an allyl group. But I'm not entirely confident about this. Maybe I should think about the structure of A. Since A is a carbonyl, after the Wittig reaction it becomes
