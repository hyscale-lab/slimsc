Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question is about the excitation of iron atoms in two stars, star_1 and star_2. The key point is that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, but wait, what does that mean exactly? I think the excitation level relates to the energy states they're in. So star_1 has more excited atoms, so higher energy levels or more atoms in a higher state?

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, that's the delta E between the two levels. So I remember from my studies that in thermal equilibrium (LTE here), the population of energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations depends on the temperature and the energy difference.

The Boltzmann factor is something like n_upper / n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. Oh wait, but wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So I think that means n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 = 2 times (n_upper_2 / n_lower_2). Or wait, maybe it's that in star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that in star_2. So the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Let me think. Let me denote the ratio for each star as R1 and R2. So R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1, R2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2. The question says R1 is twice R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

But since each R is given by the Boltzmann factor, R = exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So R1 = 2 * R2 => exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Taking natural logs of both sides: (-ΔE/(k T1)) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Let me rearrange this. Let's bring the ΔE terms to one side.

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

Wait, but the question asks for an equation involving T1 and T2. Let's see, another way to write this.

Alternatively, let's rearrange the equation:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T1) = - ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2).

Bring the ΔE/(k T2) to the left:

ΔE/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2] = ln(2).

Hmm, so that's another way to arrange it.

Wait, but perhaps I can take the ratio of R1 to R2.

R1/R2 = 2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k
