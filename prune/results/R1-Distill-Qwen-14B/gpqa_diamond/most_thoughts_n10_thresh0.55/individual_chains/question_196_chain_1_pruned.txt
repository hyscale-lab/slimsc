Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The mass is m, the maximum amplitude is A, and it obeys Hooke's law, which is F equals negative kx. Oh right, F = -kx is Hooke's law, so that's the force in the oscillator. And the speed of light is c, which probably comes into play because it's a relativistic problem.

Wait, but I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency. But since this is relativistic, I guess we have to consider relativistic effects. So, maybe the speed can't just be as high as in the classical case because of the limits imposed by relativity, like the speed of light.

Let me recall the equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Oh right, in relativity, the energy considerations change because kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the maximum kinetic energy is also (1/2)kA². But in relativity, energy is conserved, so the total energy should be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but for the oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, the oscillator's total energy is a combination of kinetic and potential. In the non-relativistic case, the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is different.

Alternatively, another approach: think about the energy at the point of maximum displacement (amplitude A). At that point, the mass is momentarily at rest, so all the energy is potential: E = (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, the potential energy is just potential, and when the mass is moving, it has kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the
