Okay, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework used to describe physics beyond the Standard Model in a systematic way using higher-dimensional operators.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries all operators must respect. So, the operators in SMEFT must be invariant under certain symmetries.

I think about the symmetries listed. Let's go through each option:

1. Lorentz Symmetry. SMEFT is constructed in a way that respects the Standard Model's symmetries, including Lorentz symmetry. All operators must transform correctly under Lorentz transformations, meaning they have to be Lorentz scalars. So, yes, this is definitely a symmetry that must be respected.

2. Poincare Symmetry. The Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations and translations. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it must also be Poincare-invariant. So operators should respect Poincare symmetry as well. Wait, but sometimes I might confuse whether Poincare is a subset of Lorentz. No, Poincare includes translations too, so yes, it's a bigger symmetry. But SMEFT, being a renormalizable theory, should include Poincare. So option 2 is correct.

3. CP Symmetry. The Standard Model itself isn't CP-symmetric, right? Like, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP, unless the operator is specifically constructed to preserve it. So I don't think all operators must respect CP symmetry. So option 3 might not be a must-respect symmetry.

4. CPT Symmetry. I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories must respect CPT symmetry, as it's a fundamental symmetry in quantum mechanics. So SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry because the underlying Standard Model does, and SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory of it. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, so which options are correct? So, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). But wait, Poincare includes translations, but operators in SMEFT are local, so they must respect Poincare. So I think 1 and 2 are correct, as well as 4.

Wait, but in SMEFT, when you construct operators, you have terms that are built out of the Standard Model fields and their derivatives. These must be Lore
