Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm not super confident about this, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that when you have a metric in two dimensions, the area element can be found using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Oh right, the area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy.

So first, I need to write down the metric tensor components. The given metric is in terms of dx² and dy², so it's diagonal. The (1,1) component is 32/(4 - x² - y²) and same for (2,2), because it's symmetric. So the off-diagonal terms are zero.

The determinant of a 2x2 diagonal matrix is just the product of the diagonal elements. So det(g) = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, wait, because g_11 is the coefficient of dx², which is 32/(4 - x² - y²), and same for g_22. So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))², where r² = x² + y². Because the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), so r² here is x²+y².

So the area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Let's compute that. sqrt( (32)^2 / (4 - r²)^2 ) = 32/(4 - r²). So dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

Wait, but in polar coordinates, dx dy is r dr dθ / something? Or wait, no, when you change from Cartesian to polar, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So if I switch to polar coordinates, where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, then dx dy = r dr dθ.

So substituting, dA = [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. So the area is the integral of dA over all r and θ where the metric is defined.

What's the domain of r here? The denominator 4 - r² must be positive, otherwise the metric would be singular or imaginary, which doesn't make physical sense. So 4 - r² > 0 → r² <4 → r < 2. So r goes from 0 to 2. And θ goes from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2, of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Wait, but since the integrand doesn't depend on θ, I can separate the integrals. So A = ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

The integral over θ would just give 2π. So A = 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 -4=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 (32 * r dr)/(u) → but r dr is (-du/2). So substituting, 32 * (-du/2) / u = -16 ∫ (du)/u from 4 to 0.

Wait, the limits change when you substitute. So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0. So when r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the integral becomes ∫ from 4 to 0 of (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) → but with substitution, r dr is -du/2. So:

∫ [32/(u)] * (-du/2) → that's -16 ∫ (du/u) from u=4 to u=0. So flipping the limits, it's 16 ∫ from 0 to4 (du/u).

Wait, ∫ du/u from 0 to4 is ln u evaluated from 0 to4, which is ln(4) - ln(0). But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this integral diverges. Oh wait, but that would mean the area is infinite.

Wait, why does this happen? Let me think: the metric is ds² = 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). So at r approaching 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the area element blow up. That suggests that the total area near r=2 is infinite. So the entire area would be infinite, making option D the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says it's a pseudosphere of radius r=2. What's a pseudosphere? I think the pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric given is similar to the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space. In the Poincaré disk model, the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), but in our case, the denominator is 4 - r². Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should express the metric in terms of the pseudosphere radius. If the pseudosphere has radius a, the metric in the Poincaré disk model is usually (a²)/(1 - (r/a)^2)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). Comparing that to our metric:

Our metric is (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). So if I factor numerator and denominator, 4 - r² = 4(1 - (r²/4)). So 32 = 4 * 8, so perhaps the denominator is 4(1 - (r²/4)).

So the metric can be rewritten as (32)/(4(1 - r²/4)) (dr² + r² dθ²) = (8)/(1 - (r²/4)) (dr² + r² dθ²).

If I compare to the standard Poincaré disk model, which is (a²)/(1 - (r/a)^2)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). So in our case, the denominator is (1 - (r²/4)) = (1 - (r/(2))²). But the factor in front is 8, and in the standard model it's a²/(denominator squared). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the scaling wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given isn't the standard Poincaré disk, but it's a similar one. But regardless, the key point is whether the integral for the area converges.

So when r approaches 2, the denominator (4 - r²) approaches zero, making the area element go to infinity. So when I compute the integral from r=0 to 2, the integral of [32 r dr]/(4 - r²) would diverge. Let me check the integral again.

So the integral is ∫ [32 r dr]/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2. Let me make the substitution u = 4 - r², du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32) * (-du/2) / u → which is -16 ∫ (du/u) from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2). So, that's -16 [ln(u)] from 4 to 0 → which is -16 (ln(0) - ln(4)).

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral becomes -16 ( -∞ - ln4 ) → which is positive infinity. So the integral diverges, giving an infinite area.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty. So the area is infinite. So the correct answer should be D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we use the area element in two dimensions, which is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric is diagonal, with components \( g_{11} = g_{22} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The determinant of the metric tensor is:

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is then:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), where \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The domain of \( r \) is \( 0 \leq r < 2 \), as the metric becomes singular when \( r = 2 \) (denominator \( 4 - r^2 \) approaches zero). The total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The \(\theta\)-integral contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

Reversing the limits:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u} \) diverges because \( \ln(u) \) evaluated at \( u = 0 \) is \( -\infty \). This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
