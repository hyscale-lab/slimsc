Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the different complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex tends to form. So the higher β values mean more of that particular complex will form.

Wait, but what do these β values correspond to? Oh right, each β is for a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^0, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the charge. Let me think: Co^(2+) with SCN^- ligands. So the first complex would be [Co(SCN)]^+, because Co^2+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)]^+ (charge 2- (-) = +1). Similarly, the second would have two SCN, so Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → [Co(SCN)2]^0? Because 2+ + 2*(-) = 0. Wait wait, maybe it's [Co(SCN)2]^0, so neutral. Then β2 would be for that, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^+? No, wait. Let me recount. For each additional SCN, the charge changes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of ligands. The general formula for the complexes would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(2+n-). Wait, no. Each SCN is -1. So Co is +2.

So for n SCN ligands:

Charge of the complex is 2+ + n*(-1) → 2 - n.

So [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1, 2-1=1+
