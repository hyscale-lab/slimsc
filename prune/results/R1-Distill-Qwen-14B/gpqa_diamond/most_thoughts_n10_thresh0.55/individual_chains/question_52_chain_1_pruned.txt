Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stars with spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does the overall temperature go down? Oh right, because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so they contribute less to the star's total luminosity. But how does that affect the photosphere's temperature?

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy difference between levels.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I think this is in the near ultraviolet or maybe the blue part of the spectrum. But how does that help? Well, the energy difference can be found using the wavelength. The formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

Let me calculate E first. Planck's constant h is approx 6.626e-34 J.s, c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10). Let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J.m. Denominator: 1448e-10 m. So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J. Hmm, but I might need this in terms of energy per particle, like eV perhaps? Or maybe I can work in units where k is in J/(K) and T is in K.

Wait, Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So (E)/(k*T) would be (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T K). Let me compute that.

E/(k*T) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23 * T) = (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 / T ≈ (0.995) * 1e5 / T ≈ 99500 / T.

Hmm, but this depends on T. So when the star has no spots (Teff=6000 K), and when it has spots (Teff=5500 K), I can compute the ratio for each case.

Wait, but the ratio is (n1/n2) which is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), assuming g1/g2 is the same in both cases (or if it's the same, then the ratio cancels out). So the ratio without spots is R1 = exp(-E/(k*T1)), and with spots R2 = exp(-E/(k*T2)). So the factor is R1/R2 = exp( (E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2)) ) ?

Wait, wait
