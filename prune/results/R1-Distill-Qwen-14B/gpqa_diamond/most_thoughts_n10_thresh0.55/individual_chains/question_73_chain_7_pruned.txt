Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, I guess I need to calculate two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. The relative speed isn't simply v1 - v2 because of the speed addition formula. But wait, no, wait. Because both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed of one with respect to the other would involve using the velocity subtraction formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of one object relative to the other.

Wait, but in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, same direction. So if I want to find the speed of astronaut B as seen from astronaut A's frame, it's (v_A - v_B)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). Or wait
