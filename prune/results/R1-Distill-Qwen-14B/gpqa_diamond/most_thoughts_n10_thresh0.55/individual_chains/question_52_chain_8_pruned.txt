Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about a star with some specific characteristics. So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. Now, the main part of the question involves the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Without spots, this ratio is observed, and when spots are present, the ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is understanding how the temperature affects the energy levels of atoms in the photosphere. Since the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann equation should apply here. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number densities of the two energy levels, g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, when the star is without spots (T1 = 6000 K), the ratio is higher, and when spots cover 40% (so T2 = 5500 K), the ratio is lower. But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. Wait, let me make sure. The question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K, and the ratio decreases. Oh, wait, no, the ratio is about the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels, level 1 and 2. So the ratio is n1/n2, and it's decreasing when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is (n1/n2)_1, and with spots, it's (n1/n2)_2, and the ratio (n1/n2)_1 / (n1/n2)_2 is the factor by which it changes.

Wait, no, the question is asking what's the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots).

So, let's denote the ratio as R = (n1)/(n2). So, R1 is when T=6000 K, R2 is when T=5500 K. The factor is R1/R2.

But wait, the transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Hmm, but does that matter for calculating the ratio? I think it's a distractor because the energy difference between the levels is what's important. Alternatively, maybe it's a hint about the energy involved in the transition. Let me think.

Wait, the wavelength λ is 1
