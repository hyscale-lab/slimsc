Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when G is heated, it releases B. B's melting point at normal conditions is close to 277 K. Another part mentions that the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm, okay. Let's tackle each part.

Starting with gas W: it's a molecule where the number of neutrons equals protons. That means the molecule is probably something like H2O or similar, but wait. Let me thinkâ€”neutrons and protons in the molecule. Wait, each molecule of W has same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule's proton count equals its neutron count.

Wait, wait. Wait, for a molecule, that's the sum of all atoms' protons and neutrons in the molecule. Wait, maybe it's a diatomic molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons? Or maybe the molecule as a whole has equal number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, no. The question says "the gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." Oh, so in the molecule, the total number of neutrons is equal to the total
