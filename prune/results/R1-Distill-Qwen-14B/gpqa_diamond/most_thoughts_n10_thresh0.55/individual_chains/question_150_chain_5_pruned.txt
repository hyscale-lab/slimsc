Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO is reacted through a series of reagents, and I need to find the final product. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, let's look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The NMR has peaks at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). 

So, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, right, the formula is C8H9NO. So, substituting: 2*8 +2 = 18. Minus H (9) and X (0, since no halogens) plus N (1). So 18-9+1=10. Divide by 2: 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. Which could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring or another double bond or a carbonyl group (another 1), so maybe a carbonyl and a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring (3) plus a double bond (1), and another ring or a carbonyl (1). Hmm.

Looking at the NMR peaks: The peak at 9.72 is a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a high ppm, so perhaps an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. But wait, the molecular formula has NO, so maybe there's a nitro group or an amine? Hmm, but the formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: C8H9NO could be a structure with a benzene ring, some substituents, maybe an aldehyde, and possibly an amino group or nitro group. But I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic compound with substituents, perhaps a substituent with an aldehyde group. Let's think about the NMR split. The triplet (t) suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So if it's an aldehyde proton, perhaps it's adjacent to a CH2 group, but wait, aldehydes are RCHO, so the aldehyde proton is usually a singlet unless there's something else adjacent. Hmm, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with an adjacent substituent.

Wait, another peak is a doublet at 6.98 (2H) and another at 6.51 (2H). These are likely from a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are usually split into a doublet each. For example, if you have a nitro group in para, the ring would have two sets of doublets. Wait, but wait, the integration is 2
