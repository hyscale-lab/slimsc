Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me think through this. I remember that when atoms are in a star's photosphere, their energy levels are related to the temperature of the star. Oh right, it's something to do with the Boltzmann distribution.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, wait, I think the excitation here refers to their energy levels. So the ratio of their populations in a specific energy level is 2:1. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states.

The Boltzmann factor is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights. But in this case, if the energy levels are the same for both stars, then g2/g1 would be the same for both. So I can probably ignore that part because it will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio of the populations (n2/n1) equals exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Wait, but in this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me clarify: the energy difference between the two levels is E = 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think that means the population ratio n1/n2 is 2. Because for the same energy level, if star_1's atoms are more excited, they have higher population in that level. So n1 = 2 n2.

So the ratio n1/n2 = 2. Plugging into the Boltzmann equation:

n1/n2 = exp( -(E)/(k T_1) ) / exp( -(E)/(k T_2) )

Wait, because for each star, the exponent would be different. Let me think again. For star 1, the population is n1, so the exponent is -(E)/(k T1). For star 2, it's -(E)/(k T2). So when we take the ratio n1/n2, it's [exp( -E/(k T1) ) / g ] divided by [exp( -E/(k T2) ) / g ] â€” wait no, because the equation is for the same transition,
