Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The options give different combinations for the relative speed and total energy, so I need to calculate both.

Wait, the question is about their relative speed. Oh, right! Because when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally like you would in classical mechanics. You have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c², which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c, which is approximately the same, so that's probably correct. But wait, let me check the options. Option C says 0.14c and E=5.96 mc², and option D says same v_rel but E=5 mc².

Next, I need to find the total energy of the system. Oh, right, in relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of the rest energies because they're moving. Each astronaut's total energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy1 is gamma1 * m_rest * c². Wait, wait. Wait, the mass given is 2m, so energy1 is 2m * gamma1 * c²? Or wait, no, energy is gamma times rest energy. Rest energy is m c². So for mass 2m, rest energy is 2m c². So energy1 is gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Similarly, for the second astronaut (3m, 0.5c):
Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) =
