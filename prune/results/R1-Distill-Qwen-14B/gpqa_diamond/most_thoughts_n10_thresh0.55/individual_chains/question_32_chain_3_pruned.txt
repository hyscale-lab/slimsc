Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 is the isotope with 3 neutrons because lithium has 3 protons normally, so 3 neutrons makes it Li-6.

So, the first thing I need to recall is the formula for relativistic energy. I think the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Oh right, and v here is 0.96c, so v = 0.96c.

The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v=0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Taking the square root of that, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, but let me calculate that more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857. Yeah, that's about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass of a single nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass defect, but wait, perhaps it's easier to look up the approximate mass of Li-6. Alternatively, I can compute it from the atomic mass.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately (3 * mass of proton + 3 * mass of neutron) minus any binding energy, but wait, the binding energy is negligible compared to the rest mass, so maybe we can approximate it as the sum of the individual nucleons.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and same for a neutron. So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So 3*(938 MeV) + 3*(938 MeV) = 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV. But wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is lower because of the binding energy. I should check the exact mass.

Wait, maybe I can get the atomic mass of Li-6. The atomic mass includes electrons as well. But for a nucleus like Li-6, the actual mass is a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Let me think. The mass number A is 6 for Li-6. So the rest mass energy is approximately A * (mass of nucle
