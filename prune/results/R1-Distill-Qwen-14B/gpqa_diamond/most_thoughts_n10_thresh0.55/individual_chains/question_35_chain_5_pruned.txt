Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. They gave me that Ay is equal to c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like this:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

I remember that the eigenvalues of a matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

Wait, but wait. Since Ay is c*S, the eigenvalues of Ay will be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S. So maybe I should first find the eigenvalues of S, and then multiply by c to get the eigenvalues of Ay.

Let me write out the matrix for Ay. Since Ay = c * S, each element of S is multiplied by c. So Ay would be:

[ 0      (-i)c ]
[ i c      0  ]

So to find the eigenvalues, I set up the equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix Ay - a I would be:

[ -a      -i c ]
[ i c      -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Wait, let's compute that. (-i c) multiplied by (i c) is (-i)(i) * c². What's (-i)(i)? i squared is -1, so (-i)(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So (-i c)(i c) = c² * (i * -i) = c² * (1) since i * (-i) is 1? Wait, no. Let me check:

i * (-i) = -(i²) = -(-1) = 1. So yes, it's c² * 1.

So the determinant is a² - (c²) = 0.
