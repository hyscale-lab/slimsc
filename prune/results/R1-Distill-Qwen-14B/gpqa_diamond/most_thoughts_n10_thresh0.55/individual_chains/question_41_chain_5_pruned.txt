Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused about where to start. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, right, I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes based on the medium's refractive index. Oh wait, the refractive index n is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (c) to its speed in the medium (v_medium). So, normally, the speed in the medium is c/n.

But wait, this glass is moving. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and it's moving towards the observer. So I need to find the speed of light relative to the lab frame.

Wait a second, I'm getting a bit tangled here. So the glass is moving, and the light is inside it. How does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light as measured by someone in the lab?

I think I should consider the frame of reference. The lab is the stationary observer, and the glass is moving. So we need to find the speed of light in the lab frame when the medium (glass) is moving.

In special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Oh right, the velocity addition formula comes into play. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, I'm not sure if that's applicable here because the medium is moving, and light is in the medium.

Wait, but in this case, the speed of light in the medium is v_light = c/n. But wait
