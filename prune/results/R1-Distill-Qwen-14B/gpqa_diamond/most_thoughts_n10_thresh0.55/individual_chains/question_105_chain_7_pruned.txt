Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how it affects the observed brightness. They want to find the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation if it were causing the change instead of the spots.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So Rstar = R_sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so their temperature is 5000K. The brightness variations are due to the star rotating, showing the spots as it turns. They say this situation is similar to an exoplanet causing the same signal. So we need to find Rpl (planet radius) divided by Rstar.

Wait, the key here is that both the spots and the planet cause a periodic dip in brightness when they pass in front of the star. So the amplitude of the dip should be the same in both cases. Therefore, I need to calculate the dip caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

But wait, how does the spot coverage affect the brightness variation? The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears slightly dimmer. But since only one hemisphere is spotted, as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing a dip in brightness.

The filling factor is 20%, which I think is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 times the total surface area of the star. The surface area of a sphere is 4πR², so the spotted area is 0.2 * 4πR² = 0.8πR².

But each spot has a lower temperature. The flux from the star without spots is F0 = σTeff^4. The flux from the spots is F_spot = σ(Teff - 1000)^4 = σ(5000)^4.

Wait, no, wait. The spots are cooler, so their flux is less. The effective temperature is Teff = 6000 K for the star. Spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

So the total flux when the spots are facing us is F_total = F0 * (1 - filling factor) + F_spot * filling factor.

Wait, no, more accurately, the unspotted regions contribute F0, and the spotted regions contribute F_spot. So the average flux when the spots are visible is:

F_avg = (area_unspotted / area_total) * F0 + (area_spotted / area_total) * F_spot

Since the filling factor is 20%, area_spotted is 0.2 * area_total. So:

F_avg = 0.8 * F0 + 0.2 * F_spot.

Then the change in flux compared to the unspotted case (F0) is:

ΔF = F_avg - F0 = 0.8F0 + 0.2F_spot - F0 = -0.2 F0 + 0.2 F_spot.

So ΔF = 0.2 (F_spot - F0).

But F_spot is (5000/6000)^4 times F0.

Let me compute that. (5000/6000) is 5/6, which is approximately 0.8333. To the 4th power: 0.8333^4 is about (0.8333²)². 0.8333² is about 0.6944, so squared again is about 0.4823. So F_spot ≈ 0.4823 F0.

So ΔF = 0.2 (0.4823 F0 - F0) = 0.2 (-0.5177 F0) ≈ -0.1035 F0.

Wait, but wait. The average brightness
