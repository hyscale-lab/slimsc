Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the constant, the more the complex forms. 

The question is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean [Co(SCN)_2]^n+? Because di means two SCN- ions attached. Oh wait, wait. I think the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^m+. The problem gives stability constants for n=1,2,3,4. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Interesting, so β2 is higher than β1, β3 is higher than both, but β4 is lower than β3. So the most stable is [CoSCN]3^- maybe?

Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue ones are the [Co(SCN)_2]^− complexes. Or wait, no— the colors might be different for different complexes. But I'm not entirely sure, but the question says "dithiocyanato," which I think means two SCN- ions. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^−? Or perhaps [Co(SCN)_2]^something else. Wait, but the charge depends on how many SCN- are attached. Each SCN- is -1. So if the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^+, since Co^2
