Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand everything.

So the question is about a star similar to the Sun, with the same radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. The astronomers are observing this star and notice brightness variations because the spots rotate into and out of view. They mention that this situation can mimic an exoplanet's signal in the light curve. The question is asking what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same amplitude in the brightness variation as the spots do. The answer should be the ratio Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm, okay. So I think this is about the change in brightness when a planet transits in front of the star versus when spots rotate into view. Both cause dips in brightness, and the question is about matching the amplitude of these dips.

First, I need to figure out the amplitude caused by the spots, then find the planet size that would cause the same dip.

Let me think about the star's luminosity. The star's total luminosity without any spots is L = 4πRstar²σTeff⁴. But spots are cooler, so they contribute less. The brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view.

Wait, the problem says the spots are on one hemisphere. So as the star rotates, the spots come into view. Because it's a hemisphere, the area covered is 20% of that hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (2πR²) ? Because a hemisphere's surface area is 2πR². But wait, the filling factor is 20%, so the area covered is 0.2 times the hemisphere's area. So area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4πR². So the spotted area is 0.4πR², and the area of the star is 4πR². So the fraction of the star covered by spots is 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 0.1, so 10% of the star is covered by spots. Wait, but the problem says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So each hemisphere (northern and southern, perhaps) can have spots. But in this case, only one hemisphere is spotty, and the filling factor is 20% on that hemisphere. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4π R². Since the star's total area is 4πR², the fraction covered is 0.4π/(4π) = 0.1, 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

But wait, when the star rotates, only a part of the spotted hemisphere is visible at any given time. So the maximum coverage is when the spot is directly in front of us. Wait, no, since the star is a sphere, as it rotates,
