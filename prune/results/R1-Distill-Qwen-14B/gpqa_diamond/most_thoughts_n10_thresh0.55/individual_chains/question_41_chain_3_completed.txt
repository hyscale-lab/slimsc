Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects how light propagates through it, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, so the glass is moving. I'm trying to recall if this is related to the concept of the medium's velocity affecting the speed of light within it. Normally, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But when the medium itself is moving, does that change the observed speed?

I remember something about the Doppler effect for light, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Doppler effect usually deals with the frequency or wavelength changes when the source or observer is moving, but this is about the medium moving. Or maybe it's more about relativistic velocities? Because if the glass is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we might need to consider special relativity.

Wait, the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. So, using units where c=1 simplifies things. Let's think about it in terms of reference frames.

In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is v_light = 1 / n. But when the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, what does that do to the speed of the light in the lab frame?

I think this is a problem involving the addition of velocities in special relativity. The formula for adding velocities between two frames is (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, the light is moving at u = 1/n in the glass's frame. So in the lab frame, its speed would be (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(c²)).

But since c=1, this simplifies to (u + v)/(1 + u v). Substituting u as 1/n, it becomes (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v).

Wait, let me double-check that. So the formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v) / c²). Since c=1, it's u' = (u + v)/(1 + u v).

So u is the speed of light in the glass in its rest frame, which is 1/n. So u =1/n. Then u' = [ (1/n) + v ] / [ 1 + (1/n)*v ].

Hmm, but the options don't immediately look like that. Let's compute the numerator and denominator.

The numerator is (1 + n v)/n. The denominator is (n + v)/n. So when you divide them, the n's cancel out.

So u' = (1 + n v) / (n + v) ) / ( (n + v)/n ), which simplifies to (1 + n v)/(n + v) * n/(n + v) )? Wait, no. Let me re-calculate:

Wait, no, let's compute it step by step.

Wait, u = 1/n. So u + v = v + 1/n = (n v +1)/n.

Denominator: 1 + u v = 1 + (1/n)*v = (n + v)/n.

So u' is [(n v +1)/n] divided by [(n + v)/n] equals (n v +1)/n * n/(n + v) → (n v +1) / (n +v).

Wait, that's the same as (1 +n v)/(n +v). So u' is (1 +n v)/(n +v).

But wait, looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n + v). So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another approach: think about the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer and in the same direction as the light. So the light is moving towards the observer as well. So from the lab frame, the light's speed is determined by adding the glass's velocity to the light's velocity in the glass's frame, but using the relativistic addition formula.

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n. So when the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, the speed of the light in the lab frame is (1/n + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v ), which again gives (1 +n v)/(n + v) after simplifying.

So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but another thought. What if the glass is moving, does that affect the index of refraction as observed in the lab? Or is the index of refraction of the moving glass different?

Hmm, this is a more complicated question. The refractive index depends on the properties of the medium, which might change if the medium is moving, but according to special relativity, the refractive index is a property of the medium at rest. Wait, no, wait. In special relativity, the refractive index is frame-dependent. Because the way electromagnetic fields transform when changing frames would affect the refractive index. So perhaps the index of refraction in the lab frame isn't the same as n when the glass is moving.

Wait, that complicates things. But the problem states that the glass has an index of refraction n. So perhaps we are to assume that the index remains n, regardless of motion. Or perhaps the problem is treating it as a non-relativistic case, where the glass's velocity doesn't affect the refractive index.

So perhaps the initial approach is correct, treating the speed addition with the formula.

Alternatively, if the glass is moving, then the speed of light in the glass is still c/n in the glass's frame, but when you transform to the lab frame, you use the velocity addition formula.

So yes, the initial calculation seems to hold. So the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab is (1 +n v)/(n +v).

Looking at the options, option A matches that.

Wait, but some of the other options don't make sense. Option B is 1, which is the speed of light in a vacuum. But since the light is in the glass, which is moving, the speed can't be c (1 in our units) unless something else is going on.

Option C is (1+nv)/(n−v). That would be if the denominator were (n −v ), which could happen if the velocity was subtracted instead of added. But since the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, we add v to u. So that would be the case when the glass is moving in the opposite direction, I think.

Option D is (1−n v)/(n +v), which has a negative numerator. Since speeds are positive, that's probably not the case.

So I think option A is the correct answer.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we start by noting that the speed of light in a medium is given by \( v_{\text{light}} = \frac{1}{n} \) in the glass's rest frame, where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. 

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

where \( u \) is the velocity of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( u' \) is the velocity of light in the lab frame. Since \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem), the formula simplifies to:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + u v}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \), we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

The \( n \) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options can be ruled out as follows:

- **Option B (\( 1 \))** corresponds to the speed of light in a vacuum, which is not applicable here since the light is propagating through a medium.
- **Option C (\( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \))** would apply if the glass were moving in the opposite direction, which is not the case here.
- **Option D (\( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \))** introduces a negative numerator, which is unphysical for a speed.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
