Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what I can remember about the techniques mentioned: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec. The question is about identifying the chemical formula based on the data from these techniques.

First, the FTIR data: there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually correspond to O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the problem says it's a very broad peak, which might suggest a hydrogen bond, maybe in a carbonyl compound. Or maybe it's an alcohol. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1700 is probably a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest something elseâ€”maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ketone or an amide. Or wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group. Hmm.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has an alkene group. So the structure must have both a carbonyl (from the IR) and a double bond (from the NMR).

Looking at the Mass Spec, the fragment peak at m/z 45. I need to think about what fragments correspond to 45. Common fragments: for example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) is m/z 91, but that's not it. Wait, 45 could be something like (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Or maybe the fragment is a smaller group. Alternatively, 45 could come from a CH3CO group, but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: the molecular ion or some fragment breaks down into a 45 m/z piece. Let's think about possible formulas. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So let's calculate the molecular weights of the options:

C6H12O: (6*12)+(12*1)+(16) = 72+12+16=100 g/mol.
C6H10O: (72)+(10)+(16)=98.
C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.
C6H12O2:72+12+32=116.

So the molecular ion would be around 100, 98, 114, or 116. The fragment at 45 is less than all of these, so it's a fragment.

What gives m/z 45? Let's think about possible groups. For example, (CH3)2CO (acetone) is 58? Wait, no: (CH3)2CO has a molecular weight of 58 (since it's C3H6O). So maybe 45 is a different fragment. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2=CH group, but that's H2C=CH2 which is 28. Hmm. Or perhaps a ketone group.

Wait, another approach: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's see: the molecular weight is 114. If the compound breaks into a fragment of 45, what's left would be 114-45=69. 69 could be something like C4H9O or similar. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a smaller part. Let's think about the possible structures. The IR suggests a carbonyl group, and the NMR suggests vinyl hydrogens, so maybe an ester with a double bond? Or a ketone with an alkene.

Wait, another thought:
