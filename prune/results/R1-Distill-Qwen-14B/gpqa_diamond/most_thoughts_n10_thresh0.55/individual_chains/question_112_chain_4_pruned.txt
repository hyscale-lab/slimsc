Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem states that there's a state |alpha> which is an electron state proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where the elements Aij are hbar/2 when i≠j and zero otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. So the first part is about finding probabilities of the eigenstates of this operator A. The second part is finding the expectation value.

Wait, but the operator's matrix is given as Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So let's think about what this operator looks like. Since |up> and |down> are the basis states, I'm assuming the system is two-dimensional. So the matrix would be 2x2.

So the matrix A would look like this:

[  0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2     0  ]

Because when i and j are different (like 1,2 and 2,1), A_ij is ħ/2. When i=j, it's zero.

Wait, but why would that be the case? Because A_ij is zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal.

Wait a second, for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2. So the matrix is:

0    ħ/2
ħ/2  0

Is that right? Yeah, that seems correct.

So the next step is: What are the eigenstates of this operator A? Because the question is about measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A.

Wait, but the state |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of S_z. But operator A is a different operator, so its eigenstates are different.

So I need to find the eigenstates of A first. Let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.

The matrix A is:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

To find the eigenvalues, I'll compute the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So,

| -λ    ħ/2 |
| ħ/2  -λ | = 0

The determinant is λ^2 - (ħ/2)^2 = 0.

So λ^2 = (ħ^2)/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now, to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

Starting with λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2 I)) v = 0 → matrix becomes:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   -ħ/2 ]

So the equations are:

-ħ/2 v1 + ħ/2 v2 = 0 → v1 = v
