Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with exactly the same masses as each other, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The detection is done using the radial velocity (RV) method. For planet #1, the spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period?

I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum speed the star moves towards or away from us. So K is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period.

The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by: 

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (P * (2π))^(1/3) ) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less massive than the Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and neglect the eccentricity e because the orbits are circular. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, the exact formula I think is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, the denominator can be approximated. So K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but in this problem, both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2, and M_star1 = M_star2.

So K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3)). Because K = (something) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3) ) / (P^(1/3)) )

Since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7, then:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), which means P ∝ 1/K^(3).

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait, let me think again. If K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then K = C / (P^(1/3)), where C is some constant. So
