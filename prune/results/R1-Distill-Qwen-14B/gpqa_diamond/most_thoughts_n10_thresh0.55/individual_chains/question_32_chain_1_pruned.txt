Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Hmm. Let me read it again. The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. I need to find the correct energy from the given options.

Wait, wait. Lithium with 3 neutrons. So, Lithium has an atomic number of 3. The isotope would be Li-6, right? Because Li usually has 3 protons. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass number is 3+3=6, so the mass is that of a Li-6 nucleus.

But wait, wait. I'm a bit rusty on isotopes. Let me think: the number of neutrons is 3, so the isotope is Li-6 (since 3 protons +3 neutrons=6). So the mass of the nucleus is the mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

I remember that when dealing with relativistic particles, the total energy includes the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But wait, particles in colliders are often accelerated to high speeds, and their kinetic energy is a significant portion of their total energy. But the question is asking for the energy of the collider, which I think refers to the kinetic energy each ion has.

Wait, no. The RHIC accelerates heavy ions to a certain speed, so the energy would be the total relativistic energy. Because in colliders, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy, or is it the total energy (
