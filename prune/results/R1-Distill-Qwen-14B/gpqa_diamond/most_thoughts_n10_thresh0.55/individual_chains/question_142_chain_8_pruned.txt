Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out where the given density matrix is positioned geometrically in the qubit space. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum states, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. Pure states are like the ones you get from a ket vector, but mixed states are statistical ensembles of pure states.

So what's this matrix look like? Let me break it down. The |0⟩⟨0| is a projector matrix that's 1 in the (1,1) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 in the (2,2) position. Adding them together would give a diagonal matrix with 1s in both diagonal positions. Then, multiplying by 1/2, so each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So the matrix ρ is:

[[1/2, 0],
 [0, 1/2]]

Wait, another way to think about this is that ρ is a diagonal matrix where the probabilities are 1/2 for both |0⟩ and |1⟩. So it's a completely mixed state for a qubit, right? Because it's like being in a superposition of the two basis states with equal probability.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I remember something about the Bloch sphere representation. Qubit states can be represented as points on a unit sphere. For a pure state |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1⟩, the corresponding point on the Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But for mixed states, it's a bit different. 

Wait, for a mixed state that's a completely mixed state, like this one where both |0⟩ and |1⟩ are equally probable, where does that lie on the Bloch sphere? I think the completely mixed state is at the origin. Because the Bloch vector for a mixed state is the expectation value of the Pauli matrices. Let me think: the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices. 

The general form
