Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector is +ħ/2. They give the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2 each. The task is to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P are often related to angular momentum. Oh wait, since the operator is P and the eigenvalue is ħ/2, I think this might be a spin-1/2 system. So P could be the spin operator for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle.

Wait, wait. The components are given as matrices. So the operator P is a vector operator, and we're looking for the eigenvector of P·n, where n is a direction in the x-z plane. Oh, right, because n lies in the x-z plane, it's in the form (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or something like that. But since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π maybe? Wait, no, any angle is possible as long as it's in the x-z plane. So n would have components (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, the question says that n lies in the x-z plane, meaning the y-component is zero. So the direction is arbitrary, but in the x-z plane. So the operator is P along this direction. But the operator P is given in terms of its components, so to get P along n, we need to compute P·n.

Right, the operator for the component of angular momentum along an arbitrary direction n is given by P·n. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So first, I need to find the matrix representation of P·n. Once I have that, I can find its eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Let me write down each component matrix:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [ [0,1],[1,0] ]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [ [0,-i],[i,0] ]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [ [1,0],[0,-1] ]

So, each of these is scaled by ħ/2.

Now, since n lies in the x-z plane, n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So, P·n = n_x (ħ/2) [ [0 1; 1 0] ] + n_z (ħ/2) [ [1 0; 0 -1] ]

Let me compute that matrix:

First, multiply each term:

n_x (ħ/2) * [0,1;1,0] = [ [0, n_x ħ/2], [n_x ħ/2, 0] ]

n_z (ħ/2) * [1,0;0,-1] = [ [n_z ħ/2, 0], [0, -n_z ħ/2] ]

Adding these together, the matrix becomes:

Top left: n_z (ħ/2)
Top right: n_x (ħ/2)
Bottom left: n_x (ħ/2)
Bottom right: -n_z (ħ/2)

So the matrix is:

[ [n_z (ħ/2), n_x (ħ/2)],
  [n_x (ħ/2), -n_z (ħ/2)] ]

Wait, wait, no. Wait, adding the two matrices. So for each element:

Top-left: (n_z * ħ/2) + 0 = n_z ħ/2

Top-right: n_x * ħ/2 + 0 = n_x ħ/2

Bottom-left: n_x * ħ/2 + 0 = n_x ħ/2

Bottom-right: ( -n_z * ħ/2 ) + 0 = -n_z ħ/2.

Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, the first term is n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which gives [[0, n_x ħ/2],[n_x ħ/2, 0]].

The second term is n_z * (ħ/2) * diag(1, -1), so [[n_z ħ/2, 0], [0, -n
