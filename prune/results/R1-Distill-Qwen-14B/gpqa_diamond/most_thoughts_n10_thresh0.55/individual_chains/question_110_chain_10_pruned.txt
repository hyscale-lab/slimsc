Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me start by understanding the question. 

ESPRESSO is at the Paranal Observatory, and HIRES is at Keck. The key here is their detection limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag in V, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag V. So the star's apparent V magnitude needs to be less than or equal to 16 for HIRES and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, because the limit is brighter than, meaning the magnitude is lower. So for both, the apparent magnitude must be ≤16, because that's the lower limit for HIRES. Because if a star is brighter than 17 (like 16), then both can see it, right? Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES can only go up to 16.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The problem says, for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So they can observe stars with V ≤17. For HIRES, stars brighter than 16 can be observed, so V ≤16. So a star must have V ≤16 to be seen by both. Because if V is 16, both can see it. If V is 17, only ESPRESSO can see it. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 to be detected by both.

Now, each star's situation needs to be evaluated. But wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes and distances, so I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes. Others have given apparent magnitudes. For the ones with absolute magnitude, I can use the distance modulus to find the apparent V magnitude. Also, some stars have extinction (E(B-V)), which affects their apparent magnitude. That's important because extinction makes stars appear dimmer (higher magnitude).

Let me go through each star:

Star1:
Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance 10 pc. The distance modulus is 5 log(d/10) = 5*(1) =5. So apparent V is 15.5 +5 = 20.5? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Absolute magnitude is M. The apparent magnitude m is m = M + 5 log1
