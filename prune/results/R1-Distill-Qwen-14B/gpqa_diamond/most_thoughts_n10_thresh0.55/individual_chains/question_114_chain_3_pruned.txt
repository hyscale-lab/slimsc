Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic substitution, especially when they have a good leaving group. Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So maybe it's an addition reaction.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with a nitrile, perhaps it's a substitution. Oh wait, I think the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the ketone's carbonyl oxygen is replaced. But wait, ketones don't usually do that. Oh wait, maybe it's a cyanohydrin formation. Oh right! The cyanohydrin reaction is when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide ions to form a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

So for the cyanohydrin formation, the ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with NaCN in acidic conditions. Because the mechanism involves protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group. So reagent A would be an acid, like H3O+ (sulfuric acid, maybe), which helps in the protonation. So looking at the options, reagent A in the options is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, but then the product is
