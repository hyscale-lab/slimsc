Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding an eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the question says that the operator is P, and we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh wait, so the direction is arbitrary but in x-z, meaning it's in the plane spanned by x and z axes. So the direction vector n would have components (0, something, something), but wait, no, the direction is in x-z plane, so y component is zero. So n is like (a,0,c) with a² + c² = 1, I guess.

The operator P is a vector operator, so it's composed of P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these has their own matrix representations multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down each component matrix.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]
So P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

P_y is (ħ/2)*[[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]

P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]
So P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

The operator P is a vector, so P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since the direction is in x-z plane, n_y must be zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). So the operator P becomes n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but how do we find the eigenvector for P when it's along an arbitrary direction? That might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to find the eigenvector for the general case along direction n, but perhaps the eigenvalue equation can be solved in terms of n_x and n_z.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, substituting P, (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me denote |ψ> as a two-component vector [a; b], where a and b are complex numbers
