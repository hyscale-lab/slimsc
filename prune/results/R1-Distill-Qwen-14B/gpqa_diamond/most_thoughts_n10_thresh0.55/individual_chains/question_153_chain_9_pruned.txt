Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, leading to the formation of an enolate. Let me try to break down each part of the question step by step.

The question has three parts: (A), (B), and (C). Each involves a Michael addition, and I need to determine the major products for each. Then, match them with the given options A, B, C, D.

Starting with reaction A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. So, I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile here because it's a diethyl malonate derivative, which is a known Michael donor. The other compound is the acceptor, since it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, how does the Michael addition work? The nucleophile (like the enolate of dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. So, in this case, the acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2CH2? Wait, I think the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is on the third position. Wait, no, wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so 3-(p-tolyl) would have the substituent on the third carbon? Or maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-position would be the end of the chain. Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-COOCH3? No, wait. Maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-CO-OEt? Or wait, wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)ac
