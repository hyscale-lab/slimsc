Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. 

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Oh, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium usually has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So Li-6. Got it.

Now, the main task is to find the energy of the nucleus. I remember that the energy of a moving relativistic particle is given by the total energy formula, which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Given that v is 0.96c, I'll plug that in. Let me compute gamma first. 

Let me compute v²/c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28² is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714... Wait, wait, more accurately, 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/0.28 is 100/28 = 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. 

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for a neutron. 

So, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass energy is (3 +3) * 938 MeV = 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that. 

6 * 938 = 5628 MeV. Oh wait, but that's in MeV. The options are in GeV, so I should convert that. 5628 MeV is 5.628 GeV.

So the rest mass energy m0c² is 5.628 GeV. 

Now, the total energy E is gamma times m0c². So 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV. Let me calculate that.

Let me do the multiplication. 3.5714 *5 = 17.857 GeV. 3.5714 * 0.628 is approximately... Let's see: 3.5714 * 0.6 is 2.1428, and 3.5714 * 0.028 is about 0.100. So total 2.2428. Adding to 17.857 gives 20.1 GeV approximately. 

Wait, but wait. Maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 3.5714 * 5.628 precisely.

Breaking it down: 3.5714 * 5 = 17.857 GeV. Then 3.5714 * 0.628:

3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284
3.5714 * 0.02 = 0.071428
3.5714 * 0.008 = 0.0285712
Adding those: 2.14284 + 0.071428 = 2.214268 + 0.0285712 = 2.2428392. 

So 17.857 + 2.2428392 = 20.0998392 GeV. Rounding that to four decimal places, it would be approximately 20.100 GeV. 

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation?

Wait, let me double-check gamma. v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root is sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857... which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximating. Maybe I missed some precise calculation steps. Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.628 GeV exactly.

3.57142857 *5.628.

Let me write this out as 3.57142857 * 5.628.

First, 3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.
3.57142857 *0.628 = ?

Breaking down 0.628 into 0.6 + 0.028.

0.6 *3.57142857 = 2.142857142.

0.028 *3.57142857 = 0.100.

So 2.142857142 + 0.100 = 2.242857142.

Adding the two parts: 17.85714285 + 2.242857142 = 20.100000 GeV. Hmm, that's exactly 20.1 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV. That's a bit higher. Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the gamma. Let me compute gamma with more decimal places.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784).

Wait sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

But perhaps the rest mass energy isn't exactly 5.628 GeV? Let me check that.

The mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Wait, so using more precise values, let's calculate m0c².

Each proton: 938.272 MeV, each neutron: 939.565 MeV. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons:

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV
3 * 939.565 =2818.695 MeV
Total: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. That's 5.633511 GeV.

Ah! So that's a more precise calculation. So m0c² is approximately 5.6335 GeV.

So now, E = gamma * m0c² = 3.57142857 * 5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511.

Wait, 0.633511 is approximately 0.6335.

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 0.6335:

3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.
3.57142857 *0.03 =0.107142857.
3.57142857 *0.0035 ≈0.0125000 (approx 3.57142857 * 0.0035 = 0.0125, exactly? Let's compute: 3.57142857 *0.0035 = 0.0125 (because 3.57142857 × 3.5e-3 = 3.57142857 * 3.5 * 1e-3 → 12.5 *1e-3=0.0125).

So adding these: 2.142857142 +0.107142857 =2.25, plus 0.0125 →2.2625. 

Wait, no, wait. 0.6335 is 0.6 + 0.03 + 0.0035. So 3.57142857 *0.6335 = 2.142857142 + 0.107142857 + 0.0125 = 2.2625.

Wait, but 0.6335 is 0.6335, so perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me do 3.57142857 * 0.633511.

3.57142857 *0.633511 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 0.633511 = ?

Alternatively, perhaps better to compute 3.57142857 * 5.633511 using exact steps.

Wait, 5.633511 is 5 + 0.6 +0.03 +0.0035 +0.000011.

But perhaps a better approach is to multiply 3.57142857 by 5.633511 as:

3.57142857 * 5.633511 = ?

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

But since I'm just thinking, perhaps I can compute it as:

3.57142857 * 5.633511 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

Now, 3.57142857 ×0.633511.

Wait, 0.633511 is approximately 0.6335.

So 3.57142857 ×0.6335 = ?

Hmm, 0.6335 = 0.6 + 0.03 + 0.0035.

So, 3.57142857 ×0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.03 = 0.107142857.

3.57142857 ×0.0035 = approximately 0.0125.

Wait, 0.0035 is 3.5e-3. So 3.57142857 ×3.5e-3 = (3.57142857 ×3.5) × 1e-3. 

3.57142857 ×3.5 = let's compute that.

3.57142857 ×3 =10.71428571.

3.57142857 ×0.5=1.785714285.

Adding them: 10.71428571 +1.785714285 =12.5. So 12.5 ×1e-3 = 0.0125.

So adding all three parts: 2.142857142 + 0.107142857 = 2.25, plus 0.0125 →2.2625.

So putting it all together: 17.85714285 +2.2625 =20.11964285 GeV.

Hmm, approximately 20.1196 GeV. 

Wait, but the exact 0.633511 is a bit more than 0.6335. Let me compute the exact value: 0.633511.

So 3.57142857 ×0.633511 = ?

Let me compute this as 3.57142857 × (0.6 + 0.033511).

3.57142857 ×0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.033511 = ?

Compute 0.033511 ×3.57142857.

0.033511 ×3 =0.100533.

0.033511 ×0.57142857 ≈0.033511 *0.5714 ≈0.0191.

Wait, 0.033511 *0.5 is 0.0167555.
0.033511 *0.07142857 ≈0.002387.

So adding: 0.0167555 +0.002387 ≈0.0191425.

So total is 0.100533 +0.0191425 ≈0.1196755.

So 3.57142857 ×0.033511 ≈0.1196755.

So combining the two parts: 2.142857142 +0.1196755 ≈2.2625326.

So E =17.85714285 +2.2625326 =20.119675 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Wait, but the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but my calculation is 20.1197 GeV, which is about 20.12 GeV. So perhaps I should round it to four decimal places. 20.1197 is approximately 20.120 GeV, which would be 20.120 GeV. But option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Hmm, perhaps I should be more precise with the rest mass. Let me recompute the rest mass using more accurate values for protons and neutrons.

Proton mass: about 938.272 MeV/c².
Neutron mass: about 939.565 MeV/c².

So for 3 protons: 3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.
3 neutrons: 3 *939.565 =2818.695 MeV.
Total: 2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

So that part is correct.

Gamma is exactly 3.57142857 (since 0.96 gives 0.0784 for 1-v²/c², sqrt is 0.28, gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857).

So E =3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute this multiplication more accurately.

3.57142857 ×5.633511:

Let me compute this as (3 + 0.57142857) × (5 + 0.633511) = 3*5 + 3*0.633511 +0.57142857*5 +0.57142857*0.633511.

Compute each term:

3*5=15.

3*0.633511=1.900533.

0.57142857*5=2.85714285.

0.57142857 *0.633511 ≈ let's compute that.

0.57142857 ×0.6 =0.342857142.
0.57142857 ×0.033511 ≈0.01914.

So 0.342857142 +0.01914 ≈0.362.

So adding all terms: 15 +1.900533=16.900533 +2.85714285=19.75767585 +0.362≈20.11967585 GeV.

So about 20.1197 GeV.

But wait, the options have option C as 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I should consider relativistic effects more precisely, perhaps using exact gamma calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the rest mass of the nucleus as the sum of individual nucleons exactly.

Wait, another approach: the rest mass of a nucleus is not exactly the sum of individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy. But in practice, the binding energy is usually much smaller than the rest mass (like on the order of a few MeV for light nuclei), so for a rough calculation, it's acceptable to just sum the individual masses. But perhaps the problem expects me to use a specific value for the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. The isotope Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.017564 u (atomic mass units). 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So let me compute that.

6.017564 u ×931.5 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.017564 ×931.5 ≈16.36 MeV.

So total is about 5589 +16.36 =5605.36 MeV →5.60536 GeV.

Wait, this is lower than the previous calculation because I'm not considering that the actual mass is less than the sum of individual nucleons due to binding energy. So the rest mass energy is about 5.60536 GeV.

Wait, that's a different value. Now, let me redo the calculation with this value.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.60536 GeV.

Let me compute this.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285 GeV.

3.57142857 ×0.60536 = ?

0.60536 ×3 =1.81608.
0.60536 ×0.57142857 ≈0.346.

So 1.81608 +0.346 ≈2.16208.

So total E ≈17.85714285 +2.16208 =20.01922 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.019 GeV. But that's not matching either. So perhaps I should use the exact calculation with 5.60536 GeV.

Wait, 3.57142857 ×5.60536.

Let me compute this accurately. 3.57142857 ×5.60536.

Break it down:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.60536 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×0.60536.

3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.
3.57142857 ×0.00536 = ?

0.00536 ×3.57142857 =0.01918.

So adding those two parts: 2.142857142 +0.01918 =2.162037142.

So E =17.85714285 +2.162037142 =20.01918 GeV.

Which is about 20.019 GeV. Hmm, but none of the options match exactly. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV, but this is lower. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.017564 u. Each u is 931.494065 MeV/c². So:

6.017564 u ×931.494065 MeV/u = ?

6 ×931.494065 =5588.96439 MeV.

0.017564 ×931.494065 ≈ let's compute: 0.01 ×931.494065=9.31494065, 0.007564 ×931.494065.

Compute 0.007 ×931.494065 =6.520458455.

0.000564 ×931.494065 ≈0.5257.

So 6.520458455 +0.5257 =7.046158455.

So 0.007564 ×931.494065 ≈7.046158455.

So 0.017564 ×931.494065 =9.31494065 +7.046158455 =16.3610991 MeV.

So total mass energy is 5588.96439 +16.3610991 =5605.32549 MeV →5.60532549 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 ×5.60532549 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 ×5.60532549.

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to use exact multiplication:

Let me write 3.57142857 as 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So 25/7 multiplied by 5.60532549.

Compute 25 ×5.60532549 =140.13313725.

Then divide by 7: 140.13313725 /7 =20.01902 GeV.

So approximately 20.019 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C at 20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the fact that the rest mass isn't exactly the sum of the nucleon masses because of binding energy. But in most cases, for heavy ions, the binding energy is small compared to the rest mass. So perhaps in this problem, the rest mass is considered as the sum of individual protons and neutrons, which gives 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, but earlier when I used that, I got approximately 20.1197 GeV, which is about 20.12 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. Perhaps the precise calculation would give 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.633511 precisely.

Let me do this step by step.

3.57142857 ×5.633511.

I'll compute this as:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.03 =0.107142857.

3.57142857 ×0.003 =0.0107142857.

3.57142857 ×0.000511= ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×0.000511.

0.000511 ×3.57142857 ≈0.001824.

So adding all these:

17.85714285 (from 5)
+2.142857142 (from 0.6) →19.999999992
+0.107142857 (from 0.03) →20.10714285
+0.0107142857 (from 0.003) →20.117857135
+0.001824 (from 0.000511) →20.119681135.

Wait, that's about 20.11968 GeV. So 20.1197 GeV, which is approximately 20.120 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use the exact value of gamma with more precision.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma with more decimal places. Let me recompute gamma.

v =0.96c, so beta=0.96.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So that's precise.

Wait, maybe the rest mass is more accurately 5.628 GeV as previously computed, leading to 3.57142857 ×5.628 =20.1 GeV.

But with the more accurate rest mass, it's 20.1196 GeV. So perhaps the intended answer is 20.132 GeV, but my calculation doesn't exactly reach that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is Li-6, but maybe I should consider that the actual mass is 5.628 GeV/c². Let me check that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects the use of the rest mass as 5.628 GeV, which is 3*(938) +3*(939) =5.628 GeV.

So using 5.628 GeV and gamma=3.57142857, compute E=3.57142857 *5.628.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.628.

Break it into 5 +0.6 +0.02 +0.008.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.02 =0.0714285714.

3.57142857 ×0.008=0.02857142856.

Adding these:

17.85714285
+2.142857142 →19.999999992
+0.0714285714 →20.071428563
+0.02857142856 →20.100000 GeV.

Wait, so exactly 20.1 GeV. But the options don't have this. Option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider more precise gamma calculation. Wait, but gamma is exact as 3.57142857...

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is actually 5.628 GeV, leading to E=20.1 GeV, but none of the options have that. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, looking at the options again: options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Wait, 20.132 is the closest to our calculation. So perhaps I made a small miscalculation, or perhaps the problem expects a slightly different approach.

Another thought: perhaps the problem uses the total relativistic energy formula E = gamma * m c², but perhaps the mass is given as the nuclear mass including binding energy. Let me check what the actual mass of Li-6 is.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017564 u. So 6.017564 u ×931.5 MeV/u = 6.017564 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5=5589.

0.017564 *931.5 = let's compute. 0.017564 ×931.5.

0.017564 *900 =15.8076.
0.017564 *31.5 =0.552534.
Total:15.8076 +0.552534=16.360134.

So total is 5589 +16.360134 =5605.360134 MeV =5.60536 GeV.

So using this, E=3.57142857 ×5.60536 GeV.

Which gives us approximately 20.019 GeV.

But again, the options don't include this. So perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the sum of individual nucleon masses, leading to 20.1 GeV, but the closest option is C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, maybe I should compute 3.57142857 ×5.628 exactly.

5.628 ×3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.628 ×3.57142857.

Hmm, 3.57142857 is 25/7, right?

So 5.628 ×25/7 = (5.628 ×25) /7.

5.628 ×25 =140.7.

140.7 /7 =20.1.

So exactly 20.1 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the initial rest mass calculation.

Another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the rest mass. Let me recount.

The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Each proton: 938 MeV.

Each neutron: 939 MeV.

So 3 *938 =2814 MeV.

3 *939 =2817 MeV.

Total:2814 +2817 =5631 MeV =5.631 GeV.

So m0c²=5.631 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 ×5.631.

Calculate this:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.631.

Compute 0.631 ×3.57142857.

0.6 ×3.57142857 =2.142857142.

0.03 ×3.57142857 =0.107142857.

0.001 ×3.57142857 =0.00357142857.

Adding these: 2.142857142 +0.107142857 =2.25 +0.00357142857 →2.25357142857.

So total E =17.85714285 +2.25357142857 =20.11071428 GeV.

So approximately 20.1107 GeV.

Hmm, which is about 20.1107 GeV, which is 20.111 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is that the speed is 0.96c, but the problem expects the use of relativistic momentum or kinetic energy calculations. But the question is about total energy, so perhaps not.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is in the unit conversion. Wait, no, I used GeV correctly.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the exact calculation using more precise values for protons and neutrons.

Proton mass: 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass:939.565 MeV/c².

So 3 protons:3×938.272=2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons:3×939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total:5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 ×5.633511 = ?

Using exact multiplication:

3.57142857 ×5.633511.

Let me compute this step by step.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.633511 = ?

Compute 0.633511 ×3.57142857.

Breaking it into parts:

0.6 ×3.57142857 =2.142857142.

0.033511 ×3.57142857.

Compute 0.03 ×3.57142857=0.107142857.

0.003511 ×3.57142857 ≈0.01255.

So 0.033511 ×3.57142857 ≈0.107142857 +0.01255=0.119692857.

So 0.633511 ×3.57142857=2.142857142 +0.119692857=2.26255.

So E =17.85714285 +2.26255=20.11969285 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact value of gamma as 3.57142857 and the exact rest mass as 5.633511 GeV, leading to E=20.1197 GeV.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the atomic mass instead of the nuclear mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 includes electrons. Let me think: a Li-6 atom has 3 electrons. Each electron has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV. So 3 electrons: 1.533 MeV. So the total rest mass would be 5.60536 GeV (nuclear) + 0.001533 GeV →5.60689 GeV. But that's negligible and perhaps not considered here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the average of the options or some approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta²=0.9216, 1-beta²=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let me recheck the initial nucleus.

Li-6: 3 protons, 3 neutrons. So 6 nucleons.

So, rest mass is sum of 3p +3n. Correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is given in terms of per nucleon, but no, the question is about the nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem calculates gamma differently. Wait, another way to compute gamma: gamma = (1 - beta^2)^-0.5.

Beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216. 1 - beta^2 is 0.0784. sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but I'm getting 20.1197 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more precisely using exact decimal multiplications.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.633511.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5.633511:

Let me compute:

3.57142857 ×5.633511 = ?

Let me compute this as 3.57142857 ×5.633511 = ?

I'll use a calculator-like approach:

5.633511 ×3.57142857.

Breakdown:

5 ×3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.633511 ×3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 ×3.57142857 =2.142857142.

0.033511 ×3.57142857.

Compute 0.03 ×3.57142857=0.107142857.

0.003511 ×3.57142857=0.012552.

So 0.033511 ×3.57142857=0.107142857 +0.012552=0.119694857.

So 0.633511 ×3.57142857=2.142857142 +0.119694857=2.262551999.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.262551999=20.11969485 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Still, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.0123 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute with more decimal places for the rest mass.

The exact rest mass of Li-6 is 6.017564 u. 1 u is exactly 931.494065 MeV/c².

So 6.017564 ×931.494065 = ?

Compute 6 ×931.494065=5588.96439 MeV.

0.017564 ×931.494065= let me compute this.

0.017564 ×931.494065.

Compute:

0.01 ×931.494065=9.31494065.

0.007 ×931.494065=6.520458455.

0.000564 ×931.494065=0.525722.

Adding these:9.31494065 +6.520458455=15.835399105 +0.525722=16.361121105 MeV.

So total rest mass energy is 5588.96439 +16.361121105=5605.3255111 MeV=5.605325511 GeV.

So using this, E=3.57142857 ×5.605325511.

Compute:

3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.605325511= ?

Compute 0.6 ×3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.005325511 ×3.57142857=0.01897.

So 0.605325511 ×3.57142857=2.142857142 +0.01897=2.161827142.

So E=17.85714285 +2.161827142=20.01897 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.019 GeV.

I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but according to my calculations, it should be around 20.12 GeV when using the sum of individual masses, or 20.02 GeV when using the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any miscalculations in the process.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use the formula E=gamma*m*c², but where m is the actual rest mass of Li-6, which is 6.017564 u.

So, m=6.017564 u ×931.494 MeV/u =5605.325 MeV =5.605325 GeV.

gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 ×5.605325.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.605325= ?

Compute 0.6 ×3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.005325 ×3.57142857=0.01897.

So 0.605325 ×3.57142857=2.142857142 +0.01897=2.161827142.

So E=17.85714285 +2.161827142=20.01897 GeV.

Hmm, so around 20.019 GeV.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of (rest mass in u) ×931.5 MeV/u, which for Li-6 would be 6.017564 ×931.5=5.605 GeV.

Wait, 6.017564 ×931.5=?

6 ×931.5=5589.

0.017564 ×931.5=16.36 MeV.

Total 5605.36 MeV=5.60536 GeV.

So E=gamma ×5.60536=3.57142857 ×5.60536=20.019 GeV.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic kinetic energy instead of total energy. But the question asks for the energy of the collider, which typically refers to the total energy.

Kinetic energy is (gamma -1) * m0c².

Total energy is gamma*m0c².

So if I compute the kinetic energy, it would be (3.57142857-1)*5.60536=2.57142857 *5.60536≈14.419 GeV.

But the question is about the energy of the collider, which would be the total energy, so I think it's correct to calculate gamma * m0c².

Hmm.

Given that none of the options exactly match my calculations, but option C is the closest to my sum of individual masses approach, I'll go with option C as the answer.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus X (Li-6) is moving at a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we calculate the total relativistic energy using the formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( m_0 c^2 \) is the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The nucleus X is Li-6, which consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using approximate masses:
- Proton mass: \( 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
- Neutron mass: \( 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)

The total rest mass energy is:
\[
m_0 c^2 = (3 \times 938.272) + (3 \times 939.565) = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma m_0 c^2 \):
\[
E = 3.57142857 \times 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this multiplication into parts:
\[
3.57142857 \times 5 = 17.85714285 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
3.57142857 \times 0.633511 \approx 2.262551999 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
E = 17.85714285 + 2.262551999 = 20.11969485 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.1197 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**. Minor discrepancies may arise due to rounding or slight variations in the rest mass values used.

Answer: C
