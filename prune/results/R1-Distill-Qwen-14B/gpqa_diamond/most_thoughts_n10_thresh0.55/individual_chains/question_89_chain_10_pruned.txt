Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me see what each part of the question is telling me.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on the first and third carbons. I think adamantane is a pretty rigid structure, so the bromines are on adjacent bridgeheads.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, it's usually an elimination reaction. So probably, this is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of an alkene. Since both bromines are on the adamantane structure, elimination would form an allene (two double bonds?) or a single double bond.

Wait, no, adamantane is a bicyclic structure. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... when you eliminate two HBr molecules, you lose two bromines and form a double bond. But wait, where would the double bond form? Since the bromines are on 1 and 3, the structure is such that eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2? Or maybe between 2 and 3?

Wait, no. Let me think. Elimination usually occurs to form the more substituted double bond because that's more stable. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so each bridgehead is connected to multiple CH2 groups.

So when KOH is used with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, it's likely an E2 elimination. Each Br is on a bridgehead, so elimination would remove two HBr molecules, and form two double bonds? Wait, but that's not possible because each elimination only forms one double bond per Br. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Each Br is on adjacent bridgeheads. So eliminating HBr from each would form a single double bond between the two bridgeheads. So the product would be 1,3-didehydro-diamantane or something like that—maybe a diene? Or wait, elimination from 1 and 3 positions would create a conjugated diene or an allene, but I'm not exactly sure about the structure.

Wait, another possibility: 1,3-dibromoadamantane might lose two equivalents of HBr, each
