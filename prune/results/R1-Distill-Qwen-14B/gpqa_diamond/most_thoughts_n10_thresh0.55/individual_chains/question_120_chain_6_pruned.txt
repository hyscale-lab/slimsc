Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Hmm, let's see. I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed... I think that means the number density of stars is constant, right? So the number of stars in a given volume is the same everywhere.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (like per unit plx) changes with plx. So I'm looking for a function N(plx) which tells me, for a certain range of parallax values, how many stars are there. 

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant. So if I have a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx, the number of stars in that shell would depend on the volume and the number density.

Let me think about the geometry. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Wait, actually, wait: plx is in arcseconds, and d is in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. So when plx increases, the distance decreases. So a small parallax means the star is far away.

So for a thin shell at distance d, the volume element would be 4πd² * dd. But since we're considering a change in parallax, I need to express this in terms of plx. So since plx = 1/d, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Oh right, because d = 1/plx, so derivative dd/dplx is -1/plx².

So the volume element would be 4π (d)^2 dd. Substituting d = 1/plx, we get 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but since the shell is thin and we're looking at a positive thickness, maybe we can ignore the negative sign because we're considering an absolute change.

So the volume element dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The volume between d and d+dd is 4π d² dd. So substituting d = 1/plx, and dd
