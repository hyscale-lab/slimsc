Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what reagent A and catalyst B are from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that acid-catalyzed reactions often involve things like aldehydes, ketones, or maybe alkenes. Wait, the product has a cyclohexylidene group attached. Cyclohexylidene implies a cyclohexene ring, maybe a ketone or something that can form an enol or undergo some kind of addition.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at the 1-position which is a cyclohexylidene methyl group. So that substituent is like a methyl group attached to a cyclohexene ring. So the structure must involve a cyclohexene group connected via a methylene bridge (CH2) to the pyrrolidine.

So thinking about what reaction forms such a structure. This seems like a type of alkylation or maybe an addition reaction. Oh, wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition or a Mannich reaction? Or perhaps an enamine formation?

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine. In acid-catalyzed reactions, secondary amines can form enamines when reacted with ketones or aldehydes. Enamine formation typically involves two steps: first, the amine reacting with a carbonyl to form a Schiff base, and then losing water to form the imine or enamine.

Wait, but in the product, I don't see an imine. Wait, the substituent is cyclohexylidene methyl. So maybe it's an enamine.

Enamine formation usually involves a ketone or aldehyde. So let's think: the starting amine is 3-methylpyrrolidine. If it reacts with a carbonyl compound, like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde), under acidic conditions, it would form an enamine.

Wait, but let me think about the steps. First, the aldehyde (A) and the amine would react in an acid-catalyzed
