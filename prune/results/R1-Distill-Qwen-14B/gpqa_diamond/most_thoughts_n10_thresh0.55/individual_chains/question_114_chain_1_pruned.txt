Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first part says: butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I think I remember that NaCN is a cyanide source, and in the presence of a acid, it can do some reactions. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So maybe this is a nucleophilic addition reaction.

Wait, when ketones react with cyanide, they usually do a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism is that the ketone's carbonyl group is attacked by the cyanide ion. But I think that might require some acid catalysis. Oh right, the acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack. So for the first reaction, NaCN is providing the cyanide nucleophile, and A is probably the acid catalyst. So A would be something like H3O+ (acid), like in the options.

Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait no, wait. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. After adding CN, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, but butanenitrile would have four carbons. Wait,
