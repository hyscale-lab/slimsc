Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually suggests an O-H or N-H stretch. But the presence of a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ points to a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ regions are around where aromatic C=C stretches appear, so the compound probably has a benzene ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data, let's break it down. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) — that's a strong singlet, maybe a phenolic OH. Wait, but if it's a carbonyl, like a carboxylic acid, the OH would be around 10-12 ppm. So that fits with a carboxylic acid. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are probably para-substituted aromatic protons. So maybe a monosubstituted benzene ring with substituents in para positions? Or wait, maybe the substituents are at the para positions relative to each other. Like, for example, if it's a benzoic acid, the substituents would be in specific positions.

The rest of the NMR: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to an electronegative group, maybe a CH attached to something like a carbonyl. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be part of a chain, perhaps a CH2 group. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) looks like a CH3 group attached to a CH, maybe a branching point. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, like an ethyl group or something similar.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a substituted benzoic acid. Let's think about the possible structures.

IR has a strong carbonyl. The NMR has a singlet at 10.5, which is a broad peak, typical of a carboxylic acid's -OH. So the compound is likely a benzoic acid derivative. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which are two doublets each with 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if the substituent is at the para position to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the substituent on the benzene would determine the splitting of the aromatic protons. If the substituent is in the para position, the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

So the benzene ring has a substituent in the para position. What's that substituent? Let's look at the other NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to another group, perhaps an ethyl chain or another substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be CH2 groups. The 1.4 (d, 3H) and 0.9 (t, 3H) suggest a branching. Let's think: 0.9 is a terminal CH3, which would be part of an ethyl group, perhaps. The 1.4 ppm with a doublet for 3H would be a CH3 attached to a CH.

Wait, that might be a sec-butyl group. Let me visualize: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait. Maybe it's a propyl chain with branching. Let's see, the 1.4 ppm is a CH3 attached to a CH that's next to something else. The 2.9 ppm is a CH that's connected to a carbonyl group. Let me think about the structure.

Suppose the structure is something like:

Phenyl ring with a substituent at the para position. The substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, maybe it's a propyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2CH3 group. No, not sure.

Wait, let's think about the possible options given. The options are A to D. Let's look at them.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

So that would be a benzene ring with ethyl group at position 4 (para to the propanoic acid group), and the propanoic acid is at position 2? Wait, but that can't be because a benzene ring can't have substituents at positions 2 and 4 if it's a para-substituted. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Maybe it's a propionic acid attached to the benzene ring. So the benzene has a propanoic acid group at position 4, and an ethyl group at position 2? No, that's not possible because position 4 is para to position 1, but position 2 is ortho to position 4. Hmm, perhaps not.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring has a benzoic acid group (COOH) at position 4, and a sec-butyl group attached. Wait, but benzoic acid is typically at position 1, and substituents can be at position 4. So the substituent is at position 4, which would be the para position relative to the COOH group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two sets of doublets for aromatic protons. So if the substituent is at position 4 (para), the aromatic protons would be split accordingly.

So, for benzoic acid, the ring would have substituents at position 4. Let me think about the structure: the COOH is at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4. So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. The ring would have two sets of doublets: the protons ortho to the substituent at 4 would be one set, and those para would be another. Wait, but if the substituent at 4 is an alkyl group, then the ring would have two sets of protons: the H's adjacent to the substituent (ortho) and the H's across (para?).

Alternatively, wait, the substituent is at position 4, so the ring would have protons ortho (2 and 6), meta (3 and 5), and para (position 1 is COOH, position 4 is substituent). But I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons, each as doublets.

Wait, the 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm peaks are each doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the ring has two sets of two equivalent H's each. That suggests that the substituent is at the para position, leading to two doublets for the aromatic protons. For example, in p-xylene, the H's are all equivalent, but in a case where there's a substituent in the para position, leading to two sets of doublets.

Wait, but if the substituent is a strong electron-withdrawing group, like a COOH group, then the ring's H's adjacent would be deshielded and appear downfield. So in benzoic acid, the ring is substituted with COOH at position 1. Then, the ring would have H's at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The H's at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and their chemical shift would be higher (more downfield). The H's at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH, and the H at 4 would be para. Wait, but in the NMR, we have two doublets each of 2H, which implies that each set is a pair of equivalent H's. So for example, positions 2 and 6 have H's, each as a doublet, and positions 3 and 5 have another set, perhaps as another doublet. Wait, that would be four H's in total, but the NMR shows two doublets of 2H each, which adds up to four H's.

Ah, that makes sense. So the substituent at position 4 would be something that creates two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. Wait, no, the substituent at position 4 would be a group, and its presence would cause the adjacent (ortho) H's to be a pair, and the next (para) H would be another pair. But if the substituent is a strong electron-withdrawing group, like COOH, then the ortho and para positions would have H's that are split into doublets.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent is at position 4, and the COOH is at position 1. So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. So the H's at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and the H's at positions 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH. Wait, but then the substituent at 4 would be, say, a substituent that is another group. Hmm, perhaps that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent at position 4 is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the NMR data again. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, which is part of an ethyl group. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a branch. For example, a sec-butyl group. Let me imagine it: CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, the substituent would be a group like -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that's a tert-butyl group. Alternatively, if it's a sec-butyl group, it would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that doesn't make sense because the branching would be on the second carbon. Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH2CH2CH2 something, but that doesn't fit with the NMR.

Wait, let's think: the substituent on the benzene is a group that has a CH2CH2CH3, but with a branch. Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH that's part of a chain. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups in a chain. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to another CH2 group perhaps.

Putting it together, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that would make it a pentyl group or something else. Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the group would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me count the carbons. So the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene. Wait, no, that would be a 3-carbon chain with a branch, making it a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. So the compound would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Now, when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a benzoic acid. Oh wait, wait: the compound X is being reacted, but if X is a benzoic acid, then under Clemmensen conditions (which are typically for ketones), but wait, Clemmensen doesn't reduce carboxylic acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the structure. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, let's think again about the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which is for reducing carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) to methylene groups. But wait, the Wolff-Kishner typically uses hydrazine and heat, but red phosphorus and HI can be part of other reductions. Alternatively, maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction, which uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat to reduce ketones to alkanes.

Wait, but the starting compound is a benzoic acid. So if X is a benzoic acid, like option C, then when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's undergoing a reduction. But carboxylic acids are generally not reduced under Clemmensen conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution or something else.

Wait, perhaps X isn't a benzoic acid. Let me reevaluate the initial assumption. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. But if X is a benzoic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm⁻¹, but a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is typically a bit lower than that, but that can vary. Alternatively, if the carbonyl is an ester or a ketone, the shift would be around 1720.

Wait, let's look at the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is characteristic of an -OH group, perhaps from a carboxylic acid. So that supports that the compound is a benzoic acid.

If X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, then when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Well, if X is a benzoic acid with a ketone group, that could be a possibility, but in our case, the substituent is an alkyl group, so perhaps the reaction is not on the carbonyl of the acid.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe X is an aromatic ester or another structure. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is part of an ester group. But the 10.5 ppm peak is strong, which would fit a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a methyl benzoate or similar. But then the IR carbonyl would be around 1720, which fits an ester. But the NMR would have a singlet for the ester oxygen, but in the given data, I don't see a triplet around 4 ppm which would be typical for an OCH2 group in an ester.

Alternatively, the IR may suggest a ketone, but the NMR has a broad peak that suggests an acid -OH.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard reagent formation, but I don't think so because red phosphorus and HI are involved.

Wait, another reaction: the reduction of a benzophenone-type ketone would remove the carbonyl group. But in this case, it's a benzoic acid.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzophenone with a substituent. But the NMR data suggests an -OH group, which wouldn't be present in a ketone.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's try to think about the reaction again. The question is about the product when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So perhaps X has a carbonyl group that is being reduced.

But if X is a benzoic acid, then the carbonyl is a carboxylic acid group. Reduction of a carboxylic acid typically yields a primary alcohol. So, for example, if X is benzoic acid, the product would be benzyl alcohol. But in this case, X is more complex.

Wait, but the options given don't seem to include any alcohols, so perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, let me think again about the structure of X. If the options are A to D, the correct structure is either a benzoic acid derivative or a substituted benzene with an isobutyl group.

Looking back at the NMR data:

- The aromatic protons are two doublets of 2H each. So, the substituent on benzene is such that it creates this splitting. For example, if the substituent is at position 4 relative to the COOH group, then the ring would have H's at positions 2,3,5,6.

Wait, but in that case, the H's at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the H's at positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So each would appear as a doublet. That makes sense. So the substituent is at position 4.

So, the structure would be 4-(substituent)benzoic acid. The substituent is an alkyl group.

The NMR data shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH adjacent to another group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): CH3 attached to CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal CH3.

Putting this together, the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let's think: the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group? No, wait. A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. But in our case, the NMR shows 0.9 ppm, which is a CH3 connected to a CH2 that's connected to a CH, which is connected to the benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, the substituent's NMR:

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): this is a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): the CH that's attached to the CH3 and perhaps another CH2.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two CH2 groups.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH3.

So the substituent's structure would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH3?

Wait, no. Let me think of the substituent as a propyl chain with a branch. The substituent would be:

-benzene ring-COOH (position 1) and substituent at position 4.

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that would be a 4-carbon substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that would be a pentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Hmm, but that would be a longer chain.

Wait, the substituent's structure would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- ?

But that's getting too long. Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that's a pentyl group again.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, making it a 3-carbon substituent (probably a propyl group with a branch). Let me consider the substituent as -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that's a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group. So, the structure would be benzene with a COOH group at position 1 and an isobutyl group at position 4. But looking at the NMR, the substituent's signals don't fit an isobutyl group. An isobutyl group would have a CH(CH3)2, but the NMR shows a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2 group.

Wait, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent would have a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3)2. The NMR would have a CH2 group as a quartet, but in the given data, the substituent's signals are 2.9 (m,1), 1.7 (m,2), 1.4 (d,3), 0.9(t,3). So, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

Alternatively, let me draw the substituent chain as:

-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3. So, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3 group. Wait, that would be a pentyl group, but the NMR seems to suggest a shorter chain.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4. The structure would be benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group at position 4.

Wait, let me think about the substituent's NMR signals. The substituent would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

So, the CH2 group would be split into two CH2 groups? Or perhaps the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which would be a pentyl group, but that's getting a bit confusing.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. But that's not correct. Wait, no, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, but the substituent is an alkyl group attached to the benzene ring. So, substituent: -(CH2)m-CH(CH3)n-CH2p- etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think about the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, attached to the benzene, it would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which is a pentyl group? No, that's four carbons. Wait, maybe it's:

-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, which would have a single CH3 attached to a central carbon. But the NMR data doesn't fit that scenario.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. That would be an isopropyl group. But the NMR doesn't seem to fit that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group, but that would be a propyl group. But in that case, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 next to the CH3, but in the data, the CH2 is at 1.7 ppm as a multiplet.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the substituent's structure. Let me try to approach this from the reaction standpoint.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Well, red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction to reduce carbonyl groups to methylene groups. But wait, Wolff-Kishner is usually for ketones and aldehydes, and it requires the presence of a hydrazine derivative. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used in the Clemmensen reduction (along with Zn) to reduce ketones to alkanes.

But in this case, X is a benzoic acid. The carbonyl is a carboxylic acid, which is not typically reduced under Clemmensen conditions, as those conditions are for ketones. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is removing the carbonyl group (the COOH) and replacing it with CH2 or something else.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with the substituent and a CH3 group where the COOH was.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't targeting the carbonyl but another group.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of an acid chloride with red phosphorus and HI can lead to substitution. But wait, in this case, X isn't an acid chloride.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is part of a ketone, not a carboxylic acid. So, if X is a ketone, then the reaction would reduce it to an alkane.

Wait, but the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which could be a ketone. The broad peak at 10.5 ppm could then be an aldehyde proton, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is from a carbonyl oxygen, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester. The IR peak at 1720 would fit an ester. But then the NMR would show a peak for the ester oxygen, but in the given data, the only singlet is at 10.5, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to make a decision based on the options.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When treated with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol. But the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol, which isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is removing the carbonyl group, converting the COOH into CH2, leading to a structure where the substituent is now attached to CH2.

Wait, but if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (COOH at position 1, sec-butyl at position 4), then reducing the carbonyl would replace the COOH with CH2, making it 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group where the COOH was. But that would require the reaction to convert COOH to CH2, which would be a two-step process: decarboxylation and then reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a benzoin condensation, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkane from the carbonyl. So, for example, the COOH would become CH2, but that would require extreme conditions, which are not indicated here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the hydroxyl group is replaced by something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the product options are A, B, C, D. Let me see what each product is.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So a benzene ring with ethyl at position 4 and a propanoic acid at position 2.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with isobutyl at position 1 and methyl at position 4. Wait, no, 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene would have substituents at positions 1 and 4.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl at position 4 and COOH at position 1.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So substituents at positions 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl).

Now, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which are used for reductions, perhaps the product is the corresponding alkane.

Wait, but in the reaction, if the benzoic acid is reduced, the COOH becomes a CH2 group. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene? No, wait, if COOH at position 1 is reduced to CH2, then the structure becomes benzene with a CH2 group attached at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. That would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D? No, because option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which has a methyl at position 4.

Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction converts the COOH to a CH3 group, making it toluene derivative. So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. After reduction, it becomes 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is toluene with a substituent at position 4, which would be option D if the substituent is at position 1. Wait, no, because I'm getting the positions mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene, which would be option D if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. But option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a different structure.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think about whether the reaction would produce an alkane or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but an elimination.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a substitution where the hydroxyl group is replaced. But I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction converts the carboxylic acid into a methyl group via a Gattermann–Koch reaction, but that requires CO and HCl, which isn't indicated here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not about the benzoic acid part but about a ketone elsewhere in the molecule. But earlier, I thought the molecule is a benzoic acid, but perhaps I was wrong.

Let me reevaluate the initial structure. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which could be a ketone. So perhaps X is a ketone with an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR again, the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 1H. That could be an aldehyde proton. But the IR doesn't show a peak that suggests an aldehyde (around 2800 cm⁻¹ for the C-H stretch). Alternatively, the 10.5 ppm could be an acidic proton, like an alcohol or an amine, but it's more likely an -OH.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cinnamic acid derivative. But the NMR doesn't seem to fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative with a substituent.

In that case, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ketone to an alkane.

So, if X is a benzophenone derivative, let's say 4-ethylbenzophenone, then the product would be 4-ethyltoluene.

But looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a methyl ketone attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, but the NMR data suggests an -OH group, which would not be present in a ketone. So that's conflicting.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a conclusion based on the data.

The IR suggests a carbonyl, likely a carboxylic acid due to the 10.5 ppm peak in NMR. The NMR shows two doublets for aromatic protons, suggesting a para-substituted benzene. The substituent's NMR suggests a chain with a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (d), which is attached to a CH (2.9 ppm), then a CH2 (1.7 ppm), and a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm).

Putting this together, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which are reducing agents, the benzoic acid's carbonyl would be reduced. But under what conditions? Clemmensen reduces ketones, not carboxylic acids.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but that would require different conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation followed by reduction. Decarboxylation of a benzoic acid would produce benzene and CO2, but that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not on the benzoic acid part but on a ketone substituent, but I don't see a ketone in X's structure.

Wait, another possibility: X is not a benzoic acid but a benzaldehyde. Then the IR would have a peak near 1720 (for the aldehyde). But the NMR at 10.5 ppm would be the aldehyde proton, which is usually a singlet around 9-10 ppm. But the 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which is more typical of an -OH than an aldehyde.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Based on the options and the data, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the benzoic acid is reduced to benzyl alcohol, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, after the reaction, perhaps the COOH is replaced by a CH2 group, leading to a structure with a methyl group where the COOH was. But that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a -CH2- group, making the substituent a CH2- group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into a benzyl group. For example, converting COOH into CH2Cl, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's not applicable here because we don't have an alkyl halide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's under different conditions.

I'm really not sure about the reaction outcome. But based on the initial structure, I think the correct answer is option C. Then, upon reduction, the product would have the substituent and the COOH converted into something else. But without knowing the exact reactivity, I'll proceed to choose the structure as option C and the reaction as a reduction leading to a methyl group substitution.

Wait, another angle: the reaction could be a hydrolysis, but that doesn't fit with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard-like reaction, but I don't think so.

In conclusion, I think the correct initial structure is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the carbonyl group. But since I'm not sure about the product, I'll have to make an educated guess.


The question involves identifying Compound X based on its IR and NMR data and determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR data shows a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, suggesting the presence of a carbonyl group, and a broad peak in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range, indicative of an -OH group. The NMR data includes two doublets for aromatic protons at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H), indicating a para-substituted benzene ring. Additional NMR signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggest a branched alkyl chain.

From the analysis, Compound X is identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). This structure features a benzoic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl substituent at position 4. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI likely reduces the carbonyl group of the benzoic acid to a methylene group, resulting in the formation of 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. However, based on the options provided, the closest match is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (option D)**, which aligns with the expected reduction product.

Answer: C
