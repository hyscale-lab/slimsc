Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. From the question, it says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can go down to 16. So, any star that's brighter (i.e., lower apparent magnitude) than 17 would be detectable by ESPRESSO, and if it's brighter than 16, it's detectable by HIRES. But wait, I think I got that backwards. Because lower magnitude means brighter. So, if a star has an apparent magnitude less than (brighter) 17 for ESPRESSO, it's observable. Similarly, for HIRES, apparent magnitude less than 16.

So the key is to find the stars whose apparent V magnitude is ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). But wait, the question says: which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So the star must meet both conditions. That is, the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 (because HIRES can't see beyond 16), and also ≤17 for ESPRESSO. So the stricter condition is ≤16. So any star with apparent V mag ≤16 can be detected by both.

But wait, some of the stars don't have
