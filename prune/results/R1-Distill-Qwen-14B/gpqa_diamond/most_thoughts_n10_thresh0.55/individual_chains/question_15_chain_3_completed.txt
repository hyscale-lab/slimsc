Alright, I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Okay, let's start by understanding the problem.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. They've already found these planets using the radial velocity (RV) method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Both planets have the same mass, which I think is important. But the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2's is P2 = 3*P1? Wait no, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter. Oh wait, no, if Planet_1's period is three times shorter, that means P1 = (1/3) * P2. So if Planet_2 has a period of, say, 300 days, Planet_1 has 100 days. Got it.

Both have circular orbits, which simplifies things because eccentricity might complicate the transit probability.

The host stars: the star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Why? Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so maybe it's a subgiant or something where it's starting to expand but hasn't yet. So despite having a higher mass, Planet_1's star is the same size as Planet_2's.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so they can observe it. The probability of transit depends on several factors, mainly the size of the planet relative to the star, and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight.

I remember that the transit probability is given by R^2 / (a^2), where R is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbit, but only considering the inclination. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a)^2, assuming edge-on alignment. But wait, that's the geometric probability. Oh wait, the geometric probability for a transit is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, squared. So P = (R_star / a)^2, but actually, it's more accurate to say that the probability is proportional to (R / a)^2, where R is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital radius. Because the chance that the planet's path crosses our line of sight is higher if the orbit is closer (a is smaller) relative to the star's size.

Wait, let me get this right. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability of this alignment is higher if the semi-major axis is smaller, because the area the planet sweeps in space is smaller relative to the star's disk. So, for a given star radius, a planet closer in has a higher probability of transiting.

So the formula for the transit probability is (R_*/ a)^2, where R_* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital radius.

But wait, in reality, the transit probability is actually (R_p + R_*)^2 / (a^2), but since the planet is much smaller than the star, R_p is negligible, so it's roughly (R_*)^2 / a^2.

So, the probability is inversely proportional to a squared and directly proportional to the square of the star's radius.

But in this case, both stars have the same radius. So R_* for both is same. So the transit probability depends inversely on a squared.

So, which planet has a smaller a? Because a smaller a would mean higher transit probability.

But how do we find a?

Well, the planets' orbital periods are given. We can use Kepler's third law to find a. Kepler's law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_* + M_p)/(4π²). But since the planet's mass is much less than the star's, we can approximate it as a^3 = (G*M_* * P^2) / (4π²). So a is proportional to (M_* * P^2)^(1/3).

Wait, but in this case, the planets have the same mass, but their semi-major axes depend on their host stars and orbital periods.

Wait, for each planet, a^3 = (G M_* P^2 )/(4 π²) * (1/(M_p + M_*) ) ) → but since M_p << M_*, we can ignore M_p. So a^3 = (G M_* P^2 )/(4 π²).

So a ∝ (M_* * P²)^(1/3).

So, for each planet, a1 and a2 are given by:

a1 = ( (G * M1 * P1² ) / (4 π²) )^(1/3 )

a2 = ( (G * M2 * P2² ) / (4 π²) )^(1/3 )

Given that M1 = 2 * M2.

Because the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2 M2.

And P1 is (1/3) P2, because Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So P1 = (1/3) P2 → P2 = 3 P1.

Wait, no: the question says the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, then Planet_1's is P/3.

So P1 = (1/3) P2.

Let me substitute that.

So a1 = ( (G M1 ( (P2/3)^2 )) )^(1/3 )

a2 = ( (G M2 P2^2 ) )^(1/3 )

So let me compute a1/a2.

a1/a2 = [ ( G M1 (P2/3)^2 ) / ( G M2 P2^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify:

= [ ( M1 / M2 ) * ( (P2^2 / 9 ) ) / P2^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ ( (2) / 1 ) * ( 1/9 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2/9) ]^(1/3 )

Because M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2/3.

So a1/a2 ≈ (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute that.

2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.606. So a1 is approximately 0.606 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Because, from the formula, a is proportional to (M P²)^(1/3). So with M1 higher and P1 lower, a1 ends up being smaller than a2.

So, since a1 < a2, and transit probability is inversely proportional to a squared, because P ∝ (R_*)^2 / a², and R_* is same for both.

So P1's transit probability is (R_*)^2 / a1^2, and P2's is (R_*)^2 / a2^2.

Thus, the ratio of probabilities (P1 / P2) = (a2^2) / (a1^2).

Because (R_*/a1)^2 divided by (R_*/a2)^2 equals (a2^2)/(a1^2).

So, P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2 = (1 / 0.606 )^2 ≈ (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

Wait, no: a1 is 0.606 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.606.

So a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

Which would mean that P1's transit probability is about 2.72 times higher than P2's.

Wait, but wait, because P1 has a smaller a. So (R_*/a1) is larger. So transit probability for Planet_1 is higher.

Wait, but the question is which is preferred, so higher probability is better. So if Planet_1's probability is higher, then the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

But let me recheck the calculations.

We have a1 = [ (G M1 P1² ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ (G M2 P2² ) ]^(1/3 )

But since P1 = P2/3, and M1 =2 M2.

So a1 = [ G*(2 M2) * ( (P2/3)^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ 2 M2 * G * P2² / 9 ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ G M2 P2² ]^(1/3 )

So a1 = [ (2 /9 ) ]^(1/3 ) * a2.

Because G, M2, P2 terms are same; so the ratio a1/a2 is (2/9)^(1/3).

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Therefore, a1 is smaller than a2 → so (R_*/a1) is larger, so (R_*/a1)^2 is larger.

So the transit probability for P1 is (R_*/a1)^2 = (1/(0.606))^2 * (R_*/a2)^2 ≈ (1.65)^2 times higher than that of P2.

Wait, no, (R_*/a1) is (R_*/ (0.606 a2 )) ) → which is (1/(0.606)) * (R_*/a2) → so (R_*/a1)^2 = (1/0.606)^2 * (R_*/a2)^2 → which is about 2.72 times higher.

So the probability that Planet_1 transits is higher than Planet_2's by a factor of ~2.72. So researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher chance of transiting.

Looking at the options:

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Option C says ~1.65 times.

Wait, but wait, the transit probability is (R_*/a)^2, but we have to make sure that the star's radius is the same for both planets.

Yes, the question states that both stars have the same radii.

So yes, Planet_1's a is smaller, so transit probability is higher.

So the probability ratio is (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72, so about 2.7 times higher for Planet_1.

So the answer should be option D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Alternatively, wait, did I mix up the ratio? Because the a ratio was a1 = 0.606 a2 → a2 = a1 /0.606 = 1.65 a1.

Wait, no: a1 is smaller than a2. So a2 is larger than a1.

So a2 = a1 * (1/0.606) ≈ a1 * 1.65.

So when computing (R_*/a1)^2 / (R_*/a2)^2 = (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So the transit probability of Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2 by a factor of ~2.72.

So the answer is D.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2 \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends inversely on \( a^2 \). Thus, a smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period, we calculate the semi-major axes for both planets. For Planet_1, \( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \) and \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_{*,1} P_1^2}{M_{*,2} P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{1 \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

This shows that \( a_1 \) is smaller than \( a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 has a smaller orbit and a higher transit probability. The ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx 1.65^2 \approx 2.72.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. The researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 due to its higher probability of transiting.
