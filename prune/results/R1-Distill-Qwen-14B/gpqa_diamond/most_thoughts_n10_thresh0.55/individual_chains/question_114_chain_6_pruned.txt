Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The first part is about the reaction of butan-2-one with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part is about treating 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B (in the presence of water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each with different reagents A and B.

Hmm, let's tackle the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a nitrile source, like NaCN, what usually happens? Oh right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. So NaCN would act as the nucleophile here.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, and when you add a cyanide ion, it would add to the carbonyl carbon. But in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile? Let me see. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That makes sense.

So the reaction is a ketone undergoing nucleophilic addition with CN-. But in such cases, an acid catalyst is often used. Because the carbonyl oxygen is protonated, making it more electrophilic. So reagent A is likely H3O+ (acid). That's option A or B for reagent A.

Wait, but sometimes in such reactions, other catalysts are used. For example, in the case of HCN addition, sometimes H2SO4 is used. But NaCN in acidic conditions would make HCN and produce the product. So reagent A would definitely be an acid. So in the options, A and B have A as H3O+; C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Wait, but what's the role of the reagent? If NaCN is used, the reaction is typically done under acidic conditions. So H3O+ would protonate the ketone, making it more reactive towards the nucleophilic attack by CN-.

So first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ (A) â†’ product. So possible options are A, B, or D. Wait, no, looking at the options, A is H3O+ for A, and C is NaHSO3.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH.

So in the first reaction, A is H3O+ in options A and B. Now, moving to the second reaction.

The second reactant is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it reacts with B (with water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires strong acidic or basic conditions, and often heat. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl and water can facilitate this.

Wait, but looking at the reactant structure, it's a 2-hydroxy-nitrile. So the structure is (PhCH2CH
