Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to parse through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about an electron state |alpha>, which is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is the standard spin-up and spin-down states. So, |up> is (1,0) and |down> is (0,1) in the spin basis.

First, since the state is proportional to that expression, I need to normalize it. So the first step would be to find the normalization constant. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, so the normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients' magnitudes.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let me compute their magnitudes. The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). The magnitude of (2-i) is sqrt( (2)^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5). So the normalization factor would be 1/sqrt( sqrt(2)^2 + sqrt(5)^2 ), wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait. The sum is |a|^2 + |b|^2, where a is (1+i), so |a|^2 is (1^2 +1^2) = 2. Similarly, |b|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2 )=4+1=5. So the sum is 2+5=7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

Next, the problem asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, so for a 2x2 system, the matrix would be:

[0   hbar/2]
[hbar/2  0]

Wait, because i is the row index and j the column. So when i≠j, A_ij = hbar/2, else 0. So the diagonal elements are 0, off-diagonal are hbar/2.

Wait, but this operator is not diagonal in the computational basis. So the eigenstates are different from |up> and |down>. So the problem is about finding the probabilities of the state |alpha> being in each of the eigenstates of this operator A.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of operator A. Let's denote the operator as a matrix:

A = (ħ/2) * [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]

Because the diagonal elements are 0 and the off-diagonal are 1, scaled by ħ/2. So the matrix is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

The eigenvalues of the Pauli X matrix are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A would be ±(ħ/2). So the eigenstates are the same as those of the Pauli X matrix, which are |+x> and |−x> states, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction.

The eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2). Wait, wait, actually, that's right. Because the Pauli X matrix is the spin-flip operator, so its eigenstates are symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions.

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|0> + |1> ) / sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|0> - |1> ) / sqrt(2), but in our case, |up> and |down> are the basis states,
