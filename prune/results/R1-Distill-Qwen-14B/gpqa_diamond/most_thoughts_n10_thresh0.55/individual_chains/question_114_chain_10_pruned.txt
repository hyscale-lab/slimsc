Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something else (A) to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which reacts with B (H2O) to become 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Then, I need to choose the correct options from A to D.

Hmm, let's tackle the first reaction first. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it usually involves some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, but ketones typically don't react directly with CN- unless under specific conditions. Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Or perhaps it's a case of the cyanide acting as a nucleophile in a substitution. Or maybe it's more about the formation of a cyanohydrin.

Wait, but wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If we are adding NaCN, which provides the CN- ion, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. But wait, I thought that for ketones, the addition would require some kind of acid catalysis. Oh right, the formation of a cyanohydrin typically involves the addition of a nitrile to a ketone under acidic conditions. So maybe A is an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B).

Wait, but what's the product here? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN-, under acidic conditions, it should form a cyanohydrin. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl carbon, and a proton is added to the oxygen, which then picks up a hydroxide or something else. Wait, no, the mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group, then the CN- attacks, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, water (or in this case, since we're using H3O+ maybe) would help in the proton transfer. So the product would have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on the same carbon, which is what we have: 2
