Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength emitted by a star is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! The peak wavelength λ_max is proportional to 1/T, so T = constant / λ_max. So if their λ_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, but wait a minute. Are we assuming that because the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures are the same? I think that's correct.

So both stars have the same temperature. That might be important for calculating their luminosities. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, right? L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but the problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies, so yes, that formula applies.

So the luminosity depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2
