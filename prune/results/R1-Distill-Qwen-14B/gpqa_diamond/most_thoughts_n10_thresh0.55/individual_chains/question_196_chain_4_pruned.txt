Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a 1D scenario. The setup is relativistic, which means I can't just use the classical formulas. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The formula is something like v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), where k is the spring constant and A is the amplitude. That's option C, but wait, this is relativistic, so that might not hold.

Relativistic effects come into play when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I need to consider how relativity changes the energy equations. I recall that in special relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the classical case, the potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and that equals the kinetic energy at maximum speed. But relativistically, the energy should account for the total energy, including rest mass energy. So the total energy E is gamma * mc². At the maximum speed, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², because the total energy is gamma mc², and the rest energy is mc². So the kinetic energy is the total minus the rest, which is (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy at maximum displacement (A) is (1/2)kA². So setting that equal to the kinetic energy gives: (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1)mc².

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic, so E = gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc². Because the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the total energy is that plus the rest mass energy.

Wait, that makes more sense. So E = gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc². So subtract mc²
