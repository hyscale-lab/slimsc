Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm. Parallax is something I remember is related to distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a larger parallax is actually closer to us.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed usually means that the number density is the same everywhere. But wait, in what space? If they're in 3D space, then the number density would be uniform. So, if I consider a sphere of radius r (distance from us), then the number of stars in that sphere would depend on volume.

Wait, parallax plx is related to distance. The formula I remember is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So d = 1/plx. So if I'm considering stars within a certain parallax range, I'm considering stars within a certain distance.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, like, how many stars have a parallax between plx and plx + dplx, for a small dplx.

But wait, since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a volume V is proportional to V. So I need to find out how V changes with plx.

Wait, what's the volume in terms of distance? So, if we consider a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume is 4π d² dd
