Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these four.

Hmm, first, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the SM has certain symmetries, and SMEFT should maintain those unless there's a good reason not to.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? I think Lorentz symmetry includes rotations and boosts, which are local transformations. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So Poincare is a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz as a subgroup. But wait, in quantum field theory, the Poincare symmetry is fundamental, but in SMEFT, maybe the operators have to respect Lorentz symmetry because they are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory.

Wait, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz-invariant. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is definitely a yes.

Now, Poincare symmetryâ€”since Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations, but I'm not sure if SMEFT requires operators to respect Poincare. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes momentum conservation because it's related to translation
