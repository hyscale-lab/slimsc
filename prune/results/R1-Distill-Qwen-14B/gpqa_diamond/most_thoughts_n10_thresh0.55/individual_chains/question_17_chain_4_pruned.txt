Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution of a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about other factors affecting EDTA. Also, the temperature is 25°C, which is standard. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. 

I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (Kf) tells us how strong the complex is. But wait, the question gives K as K_ca-EDTA =5e10, so that's the formation constant. 

So the complex is CaEDTA^2- I think. Because EDTA is usually in the form of Y^4- when it's deprotonated. So the complex would be CaY^2-.

The problem is about the concentration of free calcium ions. So the solution has the complex, and we need to find [Ca^2+]. 

The formation of the complex would be: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). 

Wait, but in solution, EDTA exists in various protonated forms. Oh but the problem says pH is ideal, so I guess we're assuming that EDTA is entirely in the Y^4- form. That makes things easier because then [EDTA^4-] is just the concentration of free EDTA.

Wait, but the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

Wait, but if all the EDTA is tied up in the complex, then the free EDTA would be in negligible amounts. Or maybe it's a common ion situation?

Wait, let me think. The complex dissociates to some extent, releasing Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. The formation constant Kf is very large (5e10), which means that the complex is very stable, so the dissociation isn't much.

So, let me set up the equation. Let
