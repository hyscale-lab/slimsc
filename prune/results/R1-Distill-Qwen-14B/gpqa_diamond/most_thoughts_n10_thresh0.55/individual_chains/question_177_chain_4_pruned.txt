Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The key points are their radii, masses, the wavelengths they emit most brightly, and their radial velocities. The question asks about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Wait, so let me parse the details again. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2. 

The spectroscopy part says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the effective temperature. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T is same since b is a constant.

Wait, but wait, what if the stars aren't perfect black bodies? Oh, the question says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so that's taken care of. So T1 = T2.

Hmm, okay. So both stars have the same temperature. Now, luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since they have the same T, the ratio of their luminosities depends on the ratio of their radii squared.

Wait, so L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Since T1 = T2, that ratio simplifies to (R1/R2)². R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2=1.5, so square is 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options have 2.25 as option A, but let's not get hasty. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything.

Wait, but wait a second. The question also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does
