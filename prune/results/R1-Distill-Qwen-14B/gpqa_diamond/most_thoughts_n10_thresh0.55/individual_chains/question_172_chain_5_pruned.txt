Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when a star is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms depends on the temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. 

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. I need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Since E2 is higher than E1, the exponent is negative, so n2 is smaller than n1 if all else is equal.

But here, the excitation is higher for star_1. Let me parse that. Star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific level. So, maybe the population n of that level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or wait, maybe the excitation is higher, which would imply higher energy level population. Oh, but the problem says "twice as excited in a specific energy level", which I think refers to the number of atoms in that level. So for star_1, n1 is twice n2.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The energy difference is given as delta E = 1.38e-23 J. So, for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state (or another state) is determined by the Boltzmann factor. 

The ratio for star_1 would be n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - deltaE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, n2 = (g2/g1) * exp( - deltaE/(k T2) ), assuming the same ground state degeneracy and same transition energy difference. 

But wait, the question states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So the ratio n1 (excited state) / n_ground1 is twice that in star_2. Or perhaps it's that the ratio of the excited population in star_1 to that in star_2 is 2:1. Hmm, the problem says "twice as excited", so maybe the ratio is n1 / n2 = 2. 

Wait, let me re-read the question: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think that the number of excited atoms in the specific energy level for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratios for each star are given by:

n1 / n_ground1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - deltaE/(k T1) )

n2 / n_ground2 = (g2/g1) * exp( - deltaE/(k T2) )

But wait, wait, the ground state is the same for both stars, or no? Wait, no, each star has its own ground state population, but
