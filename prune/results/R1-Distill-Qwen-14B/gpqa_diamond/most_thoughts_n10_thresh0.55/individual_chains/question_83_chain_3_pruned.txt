Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question says we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, first, let's think about what happens when we dilute the acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we add water, it'll dilute the concentration. Let me calculate the new concentration after dilution.

The initial moles of acetic acid can be found using Molarity = moles/volume (in liters). So the initial volume is 20 mL, which is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 mL of water, the total volume becomes 40 mL or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / new volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So now the solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but when we titrate with NaOH, each mole of NaOH will react with a mole of acetic acid. The reaction is: HC2H3O2 + OH- → C2H3O2^- + H2O.

Now, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. Let's find out how much NaOH is needed for that. But wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So let's handle each part.

First, the pH at 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So let's find the moles involved.

The moles of acetic acid initially after dilution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, no, wait. Wait, initial
