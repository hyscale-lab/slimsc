Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The problem has two parts. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Looking at the first reaction, butan-2-one is a ketone, and it's reacting with NaCN. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. So, the general reaction is ketone + HCN → secondary alcohol nitrile. But wait, in this case, the reagent is NaCN, so maybe it's a different scenario. Oh right, sometimes ketones can undergo addition with cyanide under certain conditions. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the conditions. Do I need an acid catalyst here?

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition. But NaCN is a source of CN- ions. Maybe it's a two-step process. First, the ketone attacks the cyanide, but I think that's not right because the cyanide is a strong nucleophile but for ketones, you usually need a proton source to form the enol or something. Oh, wait, wait. I remember the example where ketones react with HCN, which is a weak acid, and under certain conditions, like with H3O+ or another acid, it can form the cyanohydrin. So the reaction would be:

R2CO + HCN → R2C(OH)CN

But in this case, the reagent is NaCN, which is a salt. So perhaps it's a two-step process. Maybe the NaCN is acting as a nucleophile, but without acid, maybe it doesn't proceed. So perhaps reagent A is H3O+ which would protonate the ketone, making it more electrophilic, allowing the cyanide to attack. Or maybe the reaction is done in an acidic solution, which helps in the addition.

So for the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That's exactly what the product is. So that suggests that the reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, which requires the presence of an acid as a catalyst. So reagent A is probably H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So looking at this, the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. So the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid.

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to form carboxylic acids. The typical conditions involve using a strong acid, like HCl, and water, possibly with heat. Alternatively, sometimes a peracid is used for oxidation, but that's for ketones. Wait, no, for nitriles, hydrolysis can be done under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, the nitrile is first protonated, then undergoes hydrolysis to form an amide intermediate, which then hydrolyzes further to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the problem, the reagent B is used with H2O. So the reagent B is possibly an acid. Let's think: when you hydrolyze nitriles to acids, you typically use H2O with HCl (a strong acid) or maybe H2SO4. Alternatively, sometimes it's done in the presence of a base, but that would produce a carboxylate, which would then be acidified. But in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis is likely done under acidic conditions.

So reagent B is probably HCl. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → Seems possible.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → HCl is more likely for nitrile hydrolysis.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → Wait, what's NaHSO3? That's sodium bisulfite. Oh, sometimes that's used in reactions where you need H+ and SO3^2- as a source. For example, in the hydroboration reaction, but I don't think it's relevant here. Maybe it's used for something else.

Wait, for the first reaction, if A is NaHSO3, then that's a different scenario. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since it's a strong acid's salt) and HSO3^- which is a weaker acid. But I'm not sure how that would apply to the first reaction. If the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, then H+ is needed, which NaHSO3 can provide. But wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and HSO3^- as a base. But in the presence of HCN, which is a weak acid, perhaps the conditions are different. Hmm.

Wait, the first reaction's product is a cyanohydrin. So the reaction is ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin. The acid catalyst is H3O+ or another acid. So if reagent A is H3O+, that makes sense. But if it's NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid (HSO3^- is a weaker base than OH^-), but it's a source of H+ as well. So maybe either A or C could be possible.

Wait, but in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives the cyanohydrin. Oh wait, wait, but NaCN is a source of CN^-; perhaps the reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN and H3O+ (acid) as catalyst. So that would suggest A is H3O+.

So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

So if A is H3O+, then B must be either HCl or acetic acid.

Now, for the second reaction, to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, reagent B is either HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B). Which is more likely?

Typically, hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is done under strong acidic conditions, like HCl. Because HCl is a strong acid and a good proton donor. Acetic acid is a weaker acid; maybe it's possible but perhaps less efficient. So reagent B is likely HCl, which would make option A (A=H3O+, B=HCl) correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The first reaction is the formation of the cyanohydrin. The second reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid. So for the second reaction, another possibility is using a strong acid like HCl in water, which would fit with option A.

So putting it all together: reagent A is H3O+, and reagent B is HCl. So the correct option is A.


The problem involves two reactions. In the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, which typically requires an acid catalyst. Among the options, H3O+ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this reaction, as it protonates the ketone and facilitates the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻.

In the second reaction, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B and water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which typically requires strong acidic conditions. Among the options, HCl is the most appropriate reagent for this reaction, as it provides the strong acidic environment needed for the hydrolysis.

Considering the options:
- **Option A**: A = H3O+, B = HCl → Both reagents are suitable for their respective reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH → While H3O+ is suitable for the first reaction, CH3COOH is a weaker acid and less effective for the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl → NaHSO3 is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not an effective acid catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH → Neither reagent is suitable for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H3O+ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
