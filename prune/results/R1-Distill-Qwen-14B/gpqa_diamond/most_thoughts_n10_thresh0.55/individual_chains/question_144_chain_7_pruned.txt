Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. Hmm. I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean distance they travel before decaying depends on their lifetime and their velocity.

The given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving a different distance in meters.

Wait, I think the decay distance is calculated using the particle's lifetime and its speed. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = c * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. But τ is related to the decay width Γ. I remember that the relation involves the uncertainty principle. Oh, right, the mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the decay width Γ. The formula is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is the total decay width, and that's given in MeV units, which I'll need to convert properly.

But wait, the production energy is given as 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. That probably means that the meson is produced with some kinetic energy. Oh, but for the decay distance, maybe I just need to focus on the particle's properties and not the production energy? Hmm, maybe the production energy is a red herring here, or perhaps it's needed for calculating the velocity.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The decay distance depends on the velocity of
