Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They've given me the masses of each atom—Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, right. So the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model, combining both rotational and vibrational aspects. I remember that in such models, the energy levels account for both the rotation and vibration of the molecule.

Wait, the question is about the fundamental state. Fundamental state usually refers to the lowest energy state, so that's the ground state. But wait, when they say the next state with the lowest possible energy, I think they mean the next higher energy state. So the molecule is in the ground state, and it's absorbing a photon, which will take it to the next higher energy state.

So I need to find the energy difference between these two states because the photon's energy must match that difference. Once I have the energy, I can find the momentum of the photon since energy and momentum are related.

Wait, but photons have energy E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light. So once I find the energy difference ΔE between the two states, I can find p = ΔE / c.

But wait, what states are we talking about here? The molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). But when it absorbs a photon, it can either increase its vibrational state or rotational state, or perhaps a combination. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state after the ground state is the first excited state. So which quantum number(s) are changing?

I remember that in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are given by something like E = E_rot + E_vib. So the ground state is v=0 and J=0. The next state after that would be either v=1, J=0; or v=0, J=1; or maybe other combinations. But the question says the next state with the lowest energy. So which transition has the smallest energy? The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω. The rotational energy is E_rot = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the ground state is (v=0, J=0). The next possible state would either increase v by 1 (v=1, J=0) or increase J by 1 (v=0, J=1). Which of these has lower energy? Let's compute the energies.

The vibrational energy when v=1 is (1 + 1/2)ħω = 3/2 ħω. For J=1, the rotational energy is (1*2)*(ħ²)/(2I) )= (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So let's compute both ΔE for each possible transition.

First, let's compute E_vib for v=1 and J=0: ΔE_vib = E_v=1 - E_v=0 = (3/2 - 1/2)ħω = ħω.

For E_rot when J=1, since J=0 is the ground state: ΔE_rot = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = ( (1*2)/(2I) ) ħ² - 0 = (2/(2I)) ħ² = ħ²/(I).

So which of these is smaller? We need to compare ħω and ħ²/(I).

Let me compute I, the moment of inertia. I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) ) amu. Let me compute that.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) ) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But I need to convert this to kg because other constants are in SI units. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let me calculate that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ about 3.018e-27 kg. Let me double-check the math: 1.8 *1.66 is about 2.988, but 1.818 *1.6605:

= (1.8 * 1.6605) + (0.018 * 1.6605)
= 2.9889 + 0.029889 ≈ 3.018789e-27 kg.

So I = μ R². R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m. So R² is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.018789e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now, compute ħ²/(I) to get the rotational ΔE for J=1.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 Js. So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²s².

So ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.2075e-46 ≈ approx 9.21e-23 J.

Now, ħω is ħ multiplied by 4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

So comparing 9.21e-23 J (rotational ΔE) and 4.218e-20 J (vibrational ΔE). The rotational change requires less energy. So the photon with the smallest possible momentum would be the one that causes the molecule to transition to the next lowest state, which is the rotational state.

Wait, no. Because the question is asking for the photon that switches the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition requires less energy? Since 9.21e-23 J is much less than 4.2e-20 J, the rotational transition is lower in energy. So the photon's energy needs to match the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait. The molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0). The next possible state in energy would be the one with the least ΔE.

So in this case, the rotational transition (J=1, v=0) requires less energy than the vibrational (v=1, J=0) transition. So the photon must provide the energy for the J=1 transition.

So the energy needed is ΔE = ħω_rot, which is the rotational energy difference. Wait, but wait. The rotational energy is E_rot = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). So for J=0 to J=1, the energy increases by (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) - 0 = (ħ²)/(I).

Wait, so the energy difference for J=1 is (1 * 2 * ħ²)/(2I) ) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I), which is 9.21e-23 J as I calculated earlier.

So that's the energy the photon must have.

But wait, wait. Another thought: the quantum rotation-vibration model. So the energy levels are not purely rotational or vibrational. They are a combination. Oh, but wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the potential is not exactly harmonic, and the vibrational and rotational energies are treated together. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact form of the energy levels in that model. Maybe I need to consider that the total energy is E = E_vibrational + E_rotational, and the states are (v, J). So the ground state is v=0, J=0, and the next state could be either v=1, J=0 (vibrational first excited) or v=0, J=1 (rotational).

Which has lower energy? Let's compute both.

E_vibrational for v=1: (3/2) ħω_vib. Wait, but in the problem statement, the angular frequency given is w, so maybe it's the vibrational frequency. Because the rotational frequency is different.

Wait, the problem gives w as 4e14 rad/s, which I think refers to the vibrational angular frequency. Because that's a typical value for infrared transitions, which are vibrational.

So vibrational energy levels are (v + 1/2) ħ ω.

So the energy for v=1 is (1 + 1/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω.

And the rotational energy for J=1 is (1*(1+1) ħ²)/(2I) )= (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/I.

So let me compute both.

Compute ħω: 1.05457e-34 Js * 4e14 rad/s = approx 4.218e-20 J.

And the rotational ΔE is 9.21e-23 J as before.

Which is smaller? 9.2e-23 is about 0.0009 of 4.2e-20. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon must have energy equal to the rotational transition, right?

Wait, but how does that fit into the quantum model? Because the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0). The next state can be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). So the energy difference for (v=1, J=0) is (3/2) ħω - (1/2) ħω = ħω = 4.218e-20 J.

The energy difference for (v=0, J=1) is ħ²/(I) = 9.21e-23 J.

So which is lower? 9.2e-23 is much less than 4.2e-20. So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition, which is lower in energy.

So the photon's energy E_photon = ħ²/(I) )= 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, wait. No, because the molecule can't have both vibrational and rotational transitions at the same time. So the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1) requires a photon of energy E_rot. Alternatively, to (v=1, J=0) requires E_vib.

So the problem states that the photon causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition requires less energy? The rotational one. So the photon's energy should be E_rot.

So the momentum p is E/c. Since E = pc, so p = E / c.

Wait, yes. For a photon, E = pc, so p = E / c.

So E is 9.21e-23 J. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = roughly 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's a really small momentum. But looking at the options, they are all on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28. So my calculation is off by several orders of magnitude. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me go back and check the calculations.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation of the moment of inertia I.

Wait, let me recalculate I. I is μ R².

μ is the reduced mass. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) = 40 /22 = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculating 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ let's compute this.

1 * 1.6605 is 1.6605. 0.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.818 * 1.66 is about 1.362. So sum is 1.6605 + 1.362 = 3.0225e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 3.0225e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. So R² is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = μ R² = 3.0225e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.209e-46 kg m².

Then, ħ²/(I) is ( (1.05457e-34)^2 ) / (1.209e-46 )

Compute ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.209e-46 ≈ 9.206e-23 J.

So that's correct. So the energy is 9.206e-23 J.

So the photon's momentum p = E / c = 9.206e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

Compute that: 9.206e-23 / 3e8 = 3.068e-31 kg m/s.

But looking at the options, the smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns. Wait, but 3e-31 is way smaller than that.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the question is about the fundamental state, which in vibration-rotation coupling models, could be the first state beyond the pure rotational or pure vibrational. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the model. The problem states that it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which perhaps includes both vibrational and rotational states. So maybe the transitions are not purely vibrational or rotational but a combination.

Wait, but for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are quantized and given by the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. So the fundamental state is the lowest, (v=0, J=0). The next state would be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), whichever requires less energy.

Wait, let's reevaluate which transition requires less energy.

We have E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω.

For v=1, E_vib = (3/2) ħω ≈ 4.2e-20 J.

E_rot for J=1 is (1*(1+1)ħ²)/(2I) ) = (2ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I) ≈9.2e-23 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon should have energy 9.2e-23 J.

But then the momentum p = E / c ≈ 3e-31 kg m/s. But the options don't have anything that small.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns

These are all on the order of 1e-28 to 1e-27. So my calculation is off by 7 orders of magnitude. That suggests I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the given w is the rotational angular frequency? No, the question says w is the angular frequency of vibration, so 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model is considering only the rotational transition, not the vibrational. Or perhaps the molecule is in a rotational state, and the question is only about rotation.

Wait, no—the question says it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so both are considered.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the total energy transition when both J and v change. But that would be a combination of both, which probably requires higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the rigid rotor model. Wait, no, the question says non-rigid rotor, which is the same as the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the vibrational energy affects the moment of inertia, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, let me think about the energy levels again. The energy levels are E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher vibrational state, a higher rotational state, or both.

But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the transition with the smallest ΔE is the one to the lowest higher energy state.

So the possible transitions from (v=0, J=0):

- (v=1, J=0): ΔE = (3/2 - 1/2) ħω = ħω ≈ 4.2e-20 J.

- (v=0, J=1): ΔE = ( (2) ħ² )/(2I) )= ħ²/(I) ≈9.2e-23 J.

Which is smaller? The rotational one is smaller, so the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

But why isn't this matching any of the options? Let's compute p again.

p = E / c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options are close to this. So what's wrong?

Wait, maybe I made an error in the calculation of I.

Wait, let's recalculate I.

R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so R = 2e-10 m.

μ is (20 * 2) / (22) amu.

Ah wait, 20 amu and 2 amu. So 20 * 2 =40, 20+2=22. So μ = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that more precisely.

1.81818 * 1.6605 = ?

Let me compute 1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889.

0.01818 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.0302.

So sum is approx 2.9889 + 0.0302 = 3.0191e-27 kg.

So μ = 3.0191e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.0191e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0191e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.20764e-46 kg m².

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = (approx) 1.112e-68 J s².

So ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.20764e-46 ≈ 9.206e-23 J.

Hmm, same as before. So that's correct.

Wait, but 9.2e-23 J is the energy required for the rotational transition. So photon energy is 9.2e-23 J, which gives p= 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all much larger. So I must have made a wrong assumption.

Alternative approach: perhaps the molecule is in its vibrational ground state but can have rotational transitions. So the energy difference is purely rotational.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering the rotational part. But the question states that it's the rotation-vibration model, so both are considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is the rigid rotor, which only includes rotational energy. Oh wait, the rigid rotor is a model where the bond length is fixed, and only rotational modes are considered. The non-rigid rotor (or vibration-rotation coupling) would consider bond length changes, but I'm not sure how that affects the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question is only about the vibrational transition. Because the rotational transition is lower in energy, but perhaps the question is looking for the energy of the photon needed for the first possible transition, which is vibrational.

But then, why is the rotational option not considered? Because the question says 'the next state with the lowest possible energy'—so the smallest ΔE.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me check that again.

E_rot = (J (J+1) ħ²) / (2I)

For J=0 to J=1 transition, ΔE = (2 ħ²)/(2I) - 0 = ħ²/I.

So yes, that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the next state in the energy level sequence, which may be a combination of vibrational and rotational. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the energy in terms of the given data.

Wait another thought: perhaps the question is using the vibrational energy as the primary factor, and the rotational as a secondary factor. So the first transition would be the vibrational one.

If so, then the photon energy would be ħω = 4.218e-20 J.

So p = 4.218e-20 J / 3e8 m/s = 1.406e-29 kg m/s ≈ 1.4e-29 kg m/s. But this is way smaller than the options.

Wait, the options are in Ns. Oh wait, 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s. So the numbers I'm getting are in kg m/s, which is same as Ns.

Wait, 3e-31 Ns is 3e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are around 1e-28 Ns, which is 1e-28 kg m/s. So my calculation is way off.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the moment of inertia calculation.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So R squared is 4e-20 m². Correct.

μ is 3.019e-27 kg. Correct.

So I = μ R² = 3.019e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2076e-46 kg m². Correct.

So ħ²/(I) is (1.05457e-34)^2 / 1.2076e-46 = ?

Let me compute this precisely.

(1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 = approximately (1.112) * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68.

Divide by 1.2076e-46: 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 = approx (1.112/1.2076) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.9207 * 1e-22 = 9.207e-23 J.

So that's correct.

Hmm. I'm getting p ≈ 3e-31 Ns, but the options are nowhere near that.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake in the model. Let's think: perhaps the molecule is in its ground vibrational state, and the next state is the first rotational state. Or perhaps it's the first vibrational state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the Raman transition, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the fundamental vibrational state, which is v=1. Wait, no, fundamental state is the lowest, which is v=0.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the vibrational energy, and the rotational part is neglected, but that would be the rigid rotor model, which is not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the molecular bond length affects the rotational energy but not the vibrational. Or vice versa. Alternatively, perhaps the given parameters are for the rigid rotor model.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the rigid rotor model. So the moment of inertia is μ R², and the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (J(J+1) ħ²)/(2I).

The ground state is J=0, and the next state is J=1.

So the energy difference is (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

Which is what I computed earlier, 9.2e-23 J.

Which gives p_photon = E/c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor or considering the wrong transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational transition but the vibrational. Let's compute the photon energy for a vibrational transition.

E_photon = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 /3e8 ≈ 1.406e-29 kg m/s = 1.406e-29 Ns.

But none of the options match. The options are 1e-28 or larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion somewhere.

Wait, let me check the units again.

Energy in J: 9.2e-23 J.

Momentum p = E/c = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are 1.9e-28, 2.3e-27, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ. Let me see.

Wait, R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. But is the bond length R given in another unit? No, the question says 2 angstroms.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of μ is incorrect because I used the wrong amu to kg conversion.

Wait, 1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So 20 amu is 20 *1.660539e-27 = 3.321078e-26 kg.

2 amu is 3.321078e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) amu = 40/22 amu = (40/22)*1.660539e-27 kg.

40/22 = 1.8181818... So μ = 1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 ≈3.019e-27 kg.

Which is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given w is the rotational angular frequency, not vibrational. But the question says it's the angular frequency of vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the first overtone vibrational transition, but that's higher than the fundamental.

Wait, another approach: maybe the energy difference between the states is given by the sum of both vibrational and rotational changes.

But that seems unlikely, as the question says the next state with the lowest energy.

Wait, perhaps the model uses a different formula for energy levels. For example, in the Morse potential, the vibrational energy levels have different spacing, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energy of the photon to be the sum of the vibrational and rotational energy differences.

But that would make the energy even larger, which would result in a higher p.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition, which is 4.2e-20 J, which gives p=1.4e-29 Ns. But that's not an option either.

Another angle: perhaps the question is considering the Raman transition, which involves rotational changes, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the model is the rigid rotor, where I is fixed. So the energy difference is purely rotational.

Wait, but the question says the non-rigid rotor model, which includes vibration.

Hmm. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the energy to be considered is the vibrational energy, not the rotational.

Because 4e14 rad/s is a typical vibrational frequency, and the rotational frequencies are much lower. For example, for HCl, rotational transitions are in the microwave (around 1e11 rad/s), while vibrational is in infrared (1e13 to 1e14 rad/s). So 4e14 is vibrational.

So perhaps the photon is causing the molecule to transition to the next vibrational state, which is v=1.

In that case, the energy difference would be ΔE = (3/2) ħω - (1/2) ħω = ħω.

So E_photon = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14= 4.218e-20 J.

p = E_photon / c = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-29 kg m/s = 1.406e-29 Ns.

But none of the options match. The options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the model. Wait, maybe the molecule is treated as a rigid rotor, so only rotational transitions are considered. However, the question says non-rigid rotor, which I think is the vibration-rotation coupling model.

Wait, perhaps the total energy is calculated differently. Let me think: perhaps the vibrational energy is given as E_v = (v) ħω, instead of (v + 1/2) ħω. But that's not the standard form.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum that would cause the molecule to transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state (v=0, J=1), which is purely rotational.

But as before, that gives p=3e-31 Ns, which is not an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy using the rotational part only, regardless of the model.

If I proceed with that, the energy is 9.2e-23 J, which gives p=3e-31 Ns, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the transition but about the energy in the state. Hmm, no, the question is about the photon causing the transition.

Wait, perhaps the given w is the rotational angular frequency, not vibrational. Let me check.

If w is rotational, then w_rot =4e14 rad/s.

But that's unlikely because rotational frequencies are much lower. So perhaps I should compute the energy difference as the rotational part.

Wait, let's compute the energy difference for rotational transition using w_rot =4e14 rad/s.

Wait, but in rotational transitions, the energy difference is given by ΔE_rot = ħ w_rot (J+1) - ħ w_rot J = ħ w_rot.

But no, actually, for rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So the energy difference is (J+1 - J) * ħ w_rot.

Wait, no, the rotational energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) ħ²) / (2I) )= (J (J+1) ħ²)/(2I).

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is:

E_1 - E_0 = [ (2) * ħ²/(2I) ) ] - 0 = ħ²/(I) )= ΔE_rot.

Wait, but if the rotational frequency is ω_rot, then E_J = ħ ω_rot J (J+1) / 2.

Wait, maybe in terms of angular frequency, the rotational energy can be expressed as E_rot = ħ ω_rot J (J+1) / 2.

No, that's not correct. The correct formula is E_rot = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2I).

So if ω_rot = sqrt( (k)/(μ R²) ), but that's for the harmonic oscillator, which is a different model.

I think I'm stuck. The calculations I did don't match the options, so perhaps there's a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total energy, including both vibration and rotation, but taking the next state as (v=0, J=1), which requires 9.2e-23 J.

But the options don't have anything that small.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the energy of the photon to move from the ground state to the first excited state, which combines both vibrational and rotational. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the model.

Wait, perhaps the model combines both vibrational and rotational, and the next state is a combination of the two, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the rotational part, and I should ignore the vibrational part.

In that case, the energy is 9.2e-23 J, giving p=3e-31 Ns. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the energy in terms of the given w.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the photon energy to cause the molecule to transition from the ground vibrational state (v=0) to the first vibrational state (v=1), which requires a photon with energy ħω.

But that's 4.2e-20 J, giving p=1.4e-29 Ns.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the next state in the vibrational series, which would be the same as the fundamental vibrational transition. So the energy is ħω, which is 4.2e-20 J.

p=4.2e-20 / 3e8 = 1.4e-29 Ns.

But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency.

Wait, let's compute the rotational energy in terms of the given w.

The rotational energy difference is ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

I = μ R² = ( (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) ) * (1.66e-27) kg * (2e-10)^2.

Wait, perhaps compute ΔE_rot in terms of w.

But I'm not sure how to relate ħ²/(I) to the given w.

Wait, the vibrational w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

The relation between rotational and vibrational w would depend on the bond stiffness and the moment of inertia.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the energy change based on the vibrational w, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck here because my calculations don't match the options. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the wavenumber for the vibrational transition.

But I'm not sure that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum due to its energy, which is given by E = pc, so p = E / c.

If the energy is 4.2e-20 J, then p = 4.2e-20 /3e8 = 1.4e-29 kg m/s = 1.4e-29 Ns.

But none of the options match. So maybe I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the reduced mass in a different way. Let me re-calculate μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) = (20 * 2) / (22) ) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length R is in a different unit. Oh wait, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m, correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences. But that would be even larger.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy difference for the vibrational transition and see the options again.

Wait, if E_photon is 4.2e-20 J, p=1.4e-29 Ns. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the exponents. Let me recompute ħω.

ħ is 1.05457e-34 Js.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

So ħw = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

Yes, correct.

p = E/c =4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-29 Ns.

No, but the options are way larger.

Wait, perhaps I'm working in the wrong system of units. Let me see. Did I forget to convert anything else?

Wait, perhaps the question is using w as the rotational frequency, not vibrational. Let me compute that.

If w is the rotational frequency, then the rotational energy difference is ħw.

So E_photon = ħw =1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

Same as before.

Wait, but if the model is considering only the rotational part, which is not the case here.

I'm stuck. I think I have to proceed with the calculations as they are, even though the numbers don't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ. Let me double-check.

μ = (20 * 2) / (22) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

So 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 3.019e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

I think the correct answer is not among the options. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question meant the next state in the rotational series, so J=1, which requires E_rot= 9.2e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to consider the energy as the sum of the vibrational and rotational changes. But that would be larger than either.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the model is considering that the rotational energy is quantized, but the vibrational is the main factor, and the question is only about the vibrational transition.

But I don't see why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the given data is for the rotor, and the question is pure rotational. But the question states that it's using the rotation-vibration model.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting me to calculate the vibrational energy, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, if the photon's energy is 4.2e-20 J, which gives p=1.4e-29 Ns, but this isn't an option. The closest option is D)1.4e-28, which is 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation by a factor of 10. Let me check.

4.2e-20 /3e8 = (4.2 /3) * 1e-28 = 1.4e-28.

Ah! Oh wait, 4.2e-20 divided by 3e8 is (4.2 /3) =1.4, and 1e-20 / 1e8 =1e-28.

Oh! I see my mistake. Earlier I thought 4.2e-20 /3e8 = 1.4e-29, but actually, 1e-20 /1e8 is 1e-28. So 4.2e-20 /3e8 = (4.2/3) * 1e-28 =1.4e-28 kg m/s = 1.4e-28 Ns.

Ah! So the momentum p is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches option D.

So I must have made an error in the exponent calculation earlier.

So the correct answer is D) 1.4e-28 Ns.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between the states. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational contributions:

\[
E = E_{\text{vibrational}} + E_{\text{rotational}}
\]

### Key Parameters:
- **Masses**: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- **Bond length**: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- **Vibrational angular frequency**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)
- **Reduced mass**: 
  \[
  \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
  \]
  Converting to kilograms: \( \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).

- **Moment of inertia**: 
  \[
  I = \mu R^2 = (3.019 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2
  \]

### Energy Differences:
1. **Vibrational transition**: The energy difference between \( v = 0 \) and \( v = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \, \text{J} \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Rotational transition**: The energy difference between \( J = 0 \) and \( J = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2076 \times 10^{-46}} \, \text{J} \approx 9.207 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Next State with the Lowest Energy:
The next state with the lowest energy corresponds to the transition with the smaller energy difference. Comparing the two:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} \approx 9.207 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]
The rotational transition requires less energy. Thus, the photon must provide energy equal to \( \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} \).

### Momentum of the Photon:
The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by:
\[
p = \frac{E}{c}
\]
Substituting \( \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):
\[
p = \frac{9.207 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
\]
Converting to units of \( \text{Ns} \) (since \( 1 \, \text{Ns} = 1 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} \)):
\[
p \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
\]

### Reconciling with Options:
The calculated momentum is much smaller than the given options. However, if the question instead considers the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} \)), the momentum would be:
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vibrational}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \, \text{Ns} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
\]
This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The question likely intends for the vibrational transition to be considered, as it aligns with the given options. Therefore, the momentum of the photon is:

**Answer: D**
