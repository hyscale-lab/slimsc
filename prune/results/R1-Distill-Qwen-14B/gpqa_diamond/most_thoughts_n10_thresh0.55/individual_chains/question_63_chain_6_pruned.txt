Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I've heard about the quantum rotation-vibration model before, but I'm not entirely sure about all the details. Let me break it down.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, so the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So after absorbing a photon, it must transition to the next higher energy state.

But wait, I think I should clarify what the 'fundamental state' means here. In molecular vibrations, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational energy level, which is when the vibrational quantum number is n=0. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next state, which would be n=1.

Now, the molecule can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model. Oh right, this model considers both rotational and vibrational energies. But the question is about the momentum of the absorbed photon. So I'm guessing the photon's energy corresponds to the energy difference between the two states.

Wait, but the problem mentions momentum. Photons have momentum, p, which is related to their energy. The energy of a photon is E = pc, where c is the speed of light. Or wait, isn't E also equal to hν, where ν is the frequency? Oh right, because p = hν/c. So if I can find the energy difference between the states, I can find the photon's momentum.

So first, I need to calculate the energy difference between the fundamental state (n=0) and the next state (n=1) for the vibration. The vibrational energy levels are given by the formula E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. So the energy difference ΔE between n=0 and n=1 is E(1) - E(0) = (h w (1 + 1/2)) - (h w (0 + 1/2)) = h w (1) = h w.

Wait wait, no. Let me recalculate. E(n) = (n + 1/2) h w, so E(1) = (1 + 1/2) h w = (3/2) h w. E(0) is (0 + 1/2) h w = (1/2) h w. So the difference is (3/
