Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Interesting. Then, through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature—like Wien's Law. So, if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same? Because Wien's Law says lambda_max is proportional to 1/T. So, same lambda_max implies same temperature. Oh, wait, but wait—what about factors like the star's velocity affecting the observed wavelength? Oh right, because if a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. Because the problem also gives radial velocities: Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. So, that 700 km/s might cause a shift in the observed wavelength. Hmm, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, the intrinsic peak wavelengths are the same, or does the Doppler effect make their observed peaks the same? Hmm, this could be a point of confusion.

Wait, the problem states that the astronomers found the wavelengths to be the same. So, the observed wavelengths are the same, right? So, the intrinsic (rest) wavelengths would be different if their velocities are different. Let me think. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us (assuming the velocity is radial), the observed wavelength would be blueshifted, so the peak would be shorter than the rest. But the problem says they're the same. So, perhaps the intrinsic temperatures are different, but the Doppler shift brings their observed peak wavelengths into the same place. Or wait, no, because the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, maybe the observed maximum is same, but the intrinsic maxima are different.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity based on black body radiation—so I think they are considering the intrinsic properties. Hmm, maybe the Doppler shift doesn't affect their calculation of the luminosity because luminosity is an intrinsic property, not an observed one. Or perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but not the intrinsic luminosity. Let me think again.

Wait, luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, the total energy output. The observed flux depends on distance and any Doppler effects. But the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies. So, when calculating their luminosities, they probably use the intrinsic parameters: radius, temperature, etc., not the observed flux. So, maybe the Doppler shift doesn't directly affect the calculation of luminosity, but it might affect the determination of temperature. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, making it appear hotter. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths are the same when observed, which would imply that the intrinsic temperatures are the same, but considering Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps the observed peak wavelength is lambda_observed, which is lambda_rest multiplied by (1 + v_radial / c),
