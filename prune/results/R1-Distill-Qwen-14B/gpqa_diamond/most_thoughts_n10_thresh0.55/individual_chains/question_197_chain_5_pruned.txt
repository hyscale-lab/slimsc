Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. We need to find the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, I should figure out what Compound X is. The IR and NMR data will help me identify its structure.

Looking at the IR data: peaks around 3400–2500 cm-1 suggest the presence of either an -OH group (like in an acid or alcohol) or an alkyne. But wait, the peak at 1720 cm-1 is strong and usually indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is typical for an aldehyde proton or maybe an aromatic proton with strong deshielding. But wait, if it's an aldehyde, that's usually around 9-10 ppm. But sometimes, an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid can be around 10-12 ppm. But the integration is 1H. So maybe it's an aldehyde, but wait, let's look at the other peaks.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring H. So perhaps para-substituted aromatic protons. Like in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, same as above. So maybe this is the other set of protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. So perhaps two substituents are present, each having two protons as doublets. Wait, but the integration is 2H each. So maybe the substituents are in the para positions.

Wait, but wait—another possibility is that the aromatic ring has substituents that cause splitting. Maybe it's a substituent that creates two sets of doublets. Oh, like a para-substituted benzene where each substituent is a group that causes the adjacent protons to split into two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in the para position, and the protons on either side are each a pair of doublets.

Wait, actually, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons are usually split into two doublets. For example, if you have two substituents, each in the para position, then each set of two protons would be in the ortho positions relative to each substituent. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that each ring has two protons in each para position.

Wait, maybe the substituents are two groups in the para positions, each causing the adjacent protons to split into a doublet. So the 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm are each two protons as doublets, meaning that the substituents are in the para positions, perhaps.

Moving on, the other peaks in the NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm, integrating to 1H. This could be a methine (CH) group adjacent to an electronegative group, maybe in a carbonyl compound. Like a CH next to a ketone or ester.

-1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet integrating to 2H. Maybe this is a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, perhaps part of a propyl chain.

-1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating to 3H. This is likely a methyl group attached to a CH (since it's a doublet) that's next to another CH. So maybe it's a CH(CH3) group.

-0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H, likely a terminal methyl group (like CH2CH
