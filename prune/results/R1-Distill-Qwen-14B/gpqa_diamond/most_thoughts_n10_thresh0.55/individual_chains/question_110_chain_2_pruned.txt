Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. ESPRESSO is at the Paranal Observatory, which uses the VLT (Very Large Telescope) in Chile, while HIRES is at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. But the question is about the stars' brightness, not their location in the sky relative to the observatories. Oh wait, but wait, the problem says to disregard the pointing limits and altitudes, so I don't have to worry about whether the telescopes can actually see the star due to elevation or location. Just focus on the apparent magnitude and whether they can observe it.

The key point is the apparent V magnitude each spectrograph can handle. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. I think I should read that again. It says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed"—wait, that's a bit confusing because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. Oh right, so brighter stars have lower apparent magnitudes. So if a star has an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 (which is to say, V < 17), then ESPRESSO can observe it. Because higher magnitudes are fainter. So if a star's V is 16, it's brighter than 17 and detectable. If it's 18, it's too faint for ESPRESSO.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So any star with V < 16 can be observed by HIRES. Because 16 is the limit—brighter (lower) than 16 is okay.

So the stars must have an apparent V magnitude less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. But wait, the problem is asking which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be detectable by both; that means its apparent V must be <=16 for both. Because if it's brighter than 17 (like 17.5), ESPRESSO can't see it. Wait, no: ESPRESSO can observe up to 17, so V<17. So for a star to be visible by both, it must have V <16, because HIRES can't do more than 16. Because if V is 16.5, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So for both, the star's V must be <=16? Wait, no, because the exact phrasing is "brighter than 17" can be observed. So maybe the limit is V <=17 for ESPRESSO and V <=16 for HIRES.

Wait, the question says, "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So brighter than 17 is acceptable. Because lower magnitude is brighter. So if a star's V is, say, 16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. If V is 17.0, it's equal to 17, so
