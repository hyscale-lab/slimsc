Okay, so I've got this question about general relativity or maybe some differential geometry here. The problem is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with a specific radius. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, okay, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's involving dx and dy. So this is like a line element in 2D space. But the question is about a pseudosphere. Hmm, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid or something. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the options given are about the area, so maybe this is a 2D surface area question. The pseudosphere's area would probably involve some kind of integral over this metric.

But I'm a bit confused because I'm trying to remember the formula for the area of a surface in 2D. Oh right, the area element in 2D when you have a metric like this is sqrt(g) d²x, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. So the area would be the integral of sqrt(g) dx dy over the region.

Let me write down the metric again. It's ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), same for g_yy, and g_xy and g_yx are zero. So the determinant of the metric, g, is just the product of the diagonal terms since it's diagonal. So g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

Wait no, wait. The metric tensor is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the diagonal elements. So g = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2. So sqrt(g) would be 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy. So the area would be the double integral over some region of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric provided might be
