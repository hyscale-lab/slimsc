Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Okay, let's read the question again.

The state is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of a certain operator A. A's matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Then also find the average value of A.

Hmm, first, I'm a bit confused about the operator A. Its matrix representation is given with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So, if it's a 2x2 matrix, it would look like:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Wait, wait, because for a 2x2 spin system, i and j can be 1 and 2. So A12 and A21 are ħ/2, and A11 and A22 are zero. So A is a matrix that swaps the states or something. Wait, but what operator has this form? Oh, the Pauli matrices come to mind. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So perhaps A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Let's see: Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if I multiply by ħ/2, then A = (ħ/2) * X. Because then A's elements would be (0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0), which matches the description.

Wait, so the operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Interesting. So the eigenstates of A must be the same as the eigenstates of X, because A and X are proportional. So the eigenstates of X are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction.

Wait, but the question says to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. So I need to find the probability that the state |alpha> is in |+x> and in |-x>, right?

But wait, first, I need to normalize |alpha>. Because the problem says it's proportional to that vector; I need to find the normalization constant.

The state |alpha> is given as (
