Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically focusing on the matrix exponential function approximation using a fractional method.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that when solving PDEs, especially with finite differences, you often end up with a system of linear equations that can be represented in matrix form. The solution over time involves computing the matrix exponential, right? But matrix exponentials can be computationally intensive, especially for large matrices, which is why there's a push towards more efficient methods like parallel algorithms.

The question mentions a "fractional approximation." Fractional in what sense? Oh, maybe it's referring to using fractional time steps or some kind of approximation technique that allows for splitting the problem into smaller parts that can be handled in parallel.

In sequential methods, you solve the system step by step, maybe using something like a time-marching approach where each step depends on the previous one. But to make it parallel, you need a way to split the problem so that different parts can be computed simultaneously.

I've heard about methods like the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method, which splits the problem into different directions and solves them sequentially, but that's still not fully parallel. Maybe there's a way to approximate the matrix exponential using a technique that allows each part to be computed independently, which would enable parallel processing.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's about ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up or become inaccurate. While important for any method, I don't think it's the key factor in making the algorithm parallel.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions can complicate things, but I'm not sure how they directly relate to converting to a parallel algorithm. They might affect the setup but perhaps not the parallelization itself.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Wait, fractional approximation methods sometimes involve approximating the exponential function with a rational function. If the denominator has complex roots, that could imply oscillatory behavior. But how does that tie into parallelism? Maybe the structure of these roots allows for decomposition into smaller matrices or something that can be handled in parallel.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fractions are a way to break down complex functions into simpler terms. If the approximation can be decomposed into a sum of simpler exponentials or matrices, each part could be computed in parallel. For example, if you have A = A1 + A2 + ... and each Ai can be exponentiated separately, then you can compute exp(Ai) in parallel and sum them up.

So, the key is whether the approximation can be split into parts that can be handled independently. Linear partial fraction decomposition would allow each term to be exponentiated separately, making the process parallel.

Wait, but why is that the case? Another thought: Matrix exponentials are difficult to compute in parallel because they involve operations that are inherently sequential (like matrix multiplication). If the fractional approximation can be broken down into a sum of terms that involve smaller matrices or scalar multiples, then each term can be computed in parallel.

D says "linear partial fraction of fractional approximation." So, perhaps the approximation is expressed as a sum of terms where each term has a matrix that's easier to handle, allowing each to be exponentiated in parallel.

Alternatively,
