Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, I remember parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance (in parsecs, I think).

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So if I imagine a range of parallax values, like from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would be in that range? Oh right, since stars are uniformly distributed, their density in space is uniform. So more distant stars would have smaller parallaxes.

Let me think about how the number of stars in a certain range depends on distance. The number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell, which is 4πr². Because the volume is 4πr² dr, and if the density is uniform, the number of stars is proportional to that.

But wait, parallax is p = 1/r. So r = 1/p. So the number of stars in a thin shell should be proportional to r² dr, which is (1/p)^2 * (d(1/p)). Wait, no, I think I missed something. Let me re-express everything in terms of p.

Since r = 1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp. So the number of stars in a range of parallax from p to
