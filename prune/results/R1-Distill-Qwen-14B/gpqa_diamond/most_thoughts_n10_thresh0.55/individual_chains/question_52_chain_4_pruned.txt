Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question involves the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Titanium (Ti) in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, so when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That means when there are no spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor would be (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots).

The problem mentions that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And it's under LTE conditions, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium holds.

Wait, so the key here is to understand how the ratio of populations in two energy levels depends on temperature. I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels (n1 and n2, n2 higher than n1) is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, and k is the Boltzmann constant.

But the ratio they're talking about is the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2. So the ratio is n1/n2. So that ratio would be (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k*T)).

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The Boltzmann factor is for the higher energy level. So n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ). So E_upper is higher, so the exponent is negative, which makes sense because higher energy levels are less populated.

So the ratio n1/n2 (if 1 is lower, 2 is higher) is (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )? Or wait, no, E2 is higher than E1, so E2 - E1 is positive. So the exponent is positive because it's (E2 - E1)/(kT) multiplied by -1, so it's negative in the upper ratio.

Wait no, let's get this straight. If level 2 is higher than level 1, then ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. So the Boltzmann factor is exp( - ΔE/(kT) ). So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

So the ratio n1/n2 is the inverse of that, so (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(kT)).

But wait, the actual ratio depends on the statistical weights and the exponential term. So the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall temperature is lower (Teff goes from 6
