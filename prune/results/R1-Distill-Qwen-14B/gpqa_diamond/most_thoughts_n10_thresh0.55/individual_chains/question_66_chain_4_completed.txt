Okay, so I'm trying to answer this SMEFT question. SMEFT is the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that it's a framework that uses an effective theory approach to incorporate physics beyond the Standard Model into the Standard Model framework. The idea is that any new physics can be represented by higher-dimensional operators added to the SM Lagrangian.

The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames. In the Standard Model, all the interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. So, any operator added in SMEFT must also respect this, right? Because if an operator didn't, it would imply that the effective theory breaks Lorentz symmetry, which isn't usually how it's done. So I think Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must-respect symmetry.

Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, so if an operator respects Poincaré symmetry, it automatically respects Lorentz symmetry? Or is it the other way around? Well, Poincaré consists of the Lorentz group and translations. So all operators in the SM respect Poincaré symmetry. SMEFT extends the SM, so I think the operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry. So 2 (Poincare) would be a must.

Wait, but wait. The question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, it's not part of SMEFT. But in practice, SMEFT operators are constructed to respect the same symmetries as the SM. So operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Next, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM has some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. But in SMEFT, operators can violate CP, right? Because the effective operators come with coefficients that can be complex, leading to CP violation. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 (CP) is not a must. So the operators might or might not respect CP, but it's not a requirement. So 3 isn't a must-respect symmetry.

Then there's CPT symmetry. CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The SM respects CPT symmetry, and I think SMEFT must as well. Why? Because any operator in the effective theory should maintain the same fundamental symmetries. Breaking CPT would have profound consequences, like different vacuum energies for particle and antiparticle states, leading to possible issues with unitarity or causality. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is a must.

Putting it all together: the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4) symmetry. So the correct options are 1,2,4. Looking at the options given, option C says 1,2,4.

Wait, what are the options again? Option C is 1,2,4. Yes.

So the correct answer is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by incorporating higher-dimensional operators to account for physics beyond the SM. These operators must respect certain symmetries to maintain the consistency of the theory.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry ensures that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Since the SM respects Lorentz symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect it. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must-respect symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT extends the SM, its operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM. Thus, Poincaré symmetry (2) is also a must-respect symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). While the SM respects CP symmetry in some cases (e.g., in the strong interaction), it also allows for CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix). SMEFT operators can violate CP symmetry, as their coefficients can be complex. Therefore, CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT must preserve it to avoid issues with unitarity and causality. Thus, CPT symmetry (4) is a must-respect symmetry.

In conclusion, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). This corresponds to option C.
