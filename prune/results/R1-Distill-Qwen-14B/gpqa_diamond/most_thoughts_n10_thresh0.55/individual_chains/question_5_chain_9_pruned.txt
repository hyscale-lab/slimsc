Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the operator is called P, and it's a vector operator, so I think it has components in x, y, and z directions. The question is about the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Oh wait, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2 for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, the direction is in the x-z plane, meaning the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, I suppose. That would mean that the direction vector n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

Wait, no, wait. If it's in the x-z plane, then the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle. So yeah.

But wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components. So the operator P is a vector, so it's a sum of its components times the respective unit vectors. So P = P_x x_hat + P_y y_hat + P_z z_hat. But the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, no, no—the operator is P, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.
