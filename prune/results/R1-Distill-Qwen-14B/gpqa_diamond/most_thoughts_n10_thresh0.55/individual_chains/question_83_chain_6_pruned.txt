Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

Hmm, I think the first thing I need to do is figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when we add more water, the concentration decreases. So initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

Wait, Molarity is moles per liter. So moles of acetic acid initially would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³, the volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but when you dilute a weak acid, the degree of ionization increases, but the actual [H+] can be found using the same formula as before, just with the new concentration.

So the first part is the 25% titration point. Wait, 25% of what? Oh, I think it's 25% of the volume required to reach the equivalence point. Or is it 25% of the moles? Hmm, I think in titration, the percentage refers to the amount of titrant added relative to the equivalence point.

So let's first find the equivalence point. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. 

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So, at equivalence, moles of NaOH needed are 0.00
