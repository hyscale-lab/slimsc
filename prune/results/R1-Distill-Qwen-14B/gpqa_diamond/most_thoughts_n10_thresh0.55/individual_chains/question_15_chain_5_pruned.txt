Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. So, the question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers can decide which one to observe.

So, let's read the question again. There are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like and detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. They have the same minimum masses, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, their orbits are circular.

Their host stars have different masses but same radii. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. And Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. But wait, same star radii, so that's important.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh right, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But how does that translate into probability?

I think the formula for the probability of a planet to transit is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait, no, that's probably the probability when considering the star's size and the planet's size. But wait, the actual formula I recall is a bit different.

Wait, the transit probability is given by (R_planet + R_ moon)/(R_star + R_planet) or something like that... no, maybe that's not right. Wait, I think the probability is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's more about the orbital inclination. Oh, right, the probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. For a circular orbit, the probability P is (R_planet / a), where a is the semi-major axis. Or wait, no, that's not right either.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis) to the star's radius. No, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is given by (R*/AU) / (a in AU), no, that's not right either.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_planet / R_star) multiplied by (1 / (eccentricity * sqrt(1-e^2))) ),
