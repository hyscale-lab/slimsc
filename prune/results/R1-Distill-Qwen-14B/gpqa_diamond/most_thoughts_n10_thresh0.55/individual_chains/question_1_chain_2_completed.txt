Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. 

Wait, but wait. The energy difference between E2 and E1 is ΔE = E2 - E1. For the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, or maybe each individually? I think the key idea is that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't distinguish them. 

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty in the measurement. So, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty. Let me think again. If we have two states, each with their own lifetimes, the maximum uncertainty in each state's energy is ΔE1 and ΔE2. So the smallest energy difference that can be resolved would be when ΔE is greater than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. Or perhaps the combined uncertainty. 

Wait, maybe I should model it as the uncertainty in the energy measurement being the minimum between the two. Or perhaps it's the sum? Hmm, this part is a bit fuzzy. Alternatively, perhaps the relevant uncertainty is the inverse of the time interval over which you measure. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Another approach: The energy-time uncertainty relation is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. The lifetime τ is the time over which the state exists, so the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) for each state is approximately ħ/τ. So, for E1, ΔE1 ≈ 1e-34 / 1e-9 ≈ 1e-25 J → which is about 6.25e-7 eV. For E2, it's larger because τ is bigger: 1e-8 s gives ΔE2 ≈ 1e-26 J → 6.25e-8 eV.

Wait, no, wait. Because when τ is bigger, the uncertainty ΔE would be smaller. Because ΔE is inversely proportional to τ. So, the larger the lifetime (more time), the smaller the energy uncertainty.

Wait, that makes sense because if you have a longer time to measure, you can measure the energy more precisely (smaller ΔE). So, E1 has a shorter lifetime, so larger uncertainty in energy. 

So for E1, ΔE1 ≈ 6.56e-7 eV, and for E2, ΔE2 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. 

Now, the energy difference between the two levels must be larger than both uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than either, the states might not be resolvable. Wait, but the question is about the energy difference that allows them to be clearly resolved. So the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps the maximum uncertainty between the two. Hmm, perhaps the sum?

Alternatively, it could be that the combined uncertainty is the sum of the individual uncertainties. So, the energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Let's calculate that.

ΔE1 ≈ 6.56e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. Sum is about 7.216e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than ~7e-7 eV. 

Looking at the options:
A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 nanoeV, way smaller than 7e-7 eV. Not enough.
B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.
C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV = 1e4 * 1e-8 eV. That's way larger than 7e-7. So this would work.
D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. 1e-8 is 10^-8. 7e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-8 is smaller than 7e-7. So option D is smaller than the required sum. 

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculations. Because I might have mixed up the exponents.

Wait, E1's ΔE is around 6.56e-7 eV, which is 0.000000656 eV. E2's ΔE is 6.56e-8 eV, which is 0.0000000656 eV.

So the sum is approximately 0.0000007216 eV, which is 7.216e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than this sum. So the smallest option that is larger than 7.2e-7 eV is option C) 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, or 1e-4 eV. That's way bigger than 7e-7. 

So the correct answer would be option C. Because the energy difference must be larger than the combined uncertainties to be resolvable. So the only option that's larger is C.

Wait, but let me think again. Are the uncertainties in E1 and E2 the only factors? Or is there another way to model this?

Another approach: For the energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy. So the minimum ΔE is the uncertainty in energy of the system. But wait, what's the system's uncertainty here? 

Wait, perhaps each state has its own uncertainty. So when you measure the energy of E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1, and when you measure E2, the uncertainty is ΔE2. So if the energy difference between E1 and E2 is much larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the states are resolvable. 

So the energy difference Δ(E2 - E1) must be much larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. 

In that case, the energy difference has to be greater than either ΔE1 or ΔE2. Because if it's larger than both, it's definitely larger than the sum as well, but the sum isn't needed. Wait, no. Let me think. Let's say the energy difference is larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because the larger uncertainty is the one that's more significant.

Wait, for E1, the uncertainty is larger (6.56e-7 eV) than E2's (6.56e-8 eV). So if the energy difference is larger than 6.56e-7 eV, then it would be larger than both. 

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 0.0001, which is 100 times larger than 1e-6. Wait, 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. 6.56e-7 is 0.000000656 eV, which is 6.56e-7 eV. So 1e-4 is about 153 times larger than 6.56e-7. So that would definitely be resolvable.

So the correct option is C. Because it's the only one larger than the required 6.56e-7 eV.


To determine the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. For \( E_1 \), the lifetime is \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \), and for \( E_2 \), the lifetime is \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The uncertainty in energy for each state is approximately:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \, \text{J} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \, \text{J} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the combined uncertainty in energy to ensure the two states are distinguishable. The combined uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we compare this threshold with the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \, \text{nanoeV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**. Therefore, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
