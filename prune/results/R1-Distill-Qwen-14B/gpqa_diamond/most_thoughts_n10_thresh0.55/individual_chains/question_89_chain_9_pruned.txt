Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

First, I need to figure out what each step does. Let's start from the beginning.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very stable. The molecule has two bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. When dihalides react with strong bases like KOH, especially in elimination reactions, they might form alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. But wait, dibromide plus KOH could lead to elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, but when two bromines are on adjacent carbons, like in 1,2-dibromide, KOH would typically eliminate to form an alkene. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are on carbons that are two apart. Hmm, I'm not sure if that's a vicinal dihalide or a diegeminal or something else. Wait, adamantane's structure is a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So, the positions might be across from each other. Not sure, but perhaps the reaction is elimination.

Wait, KOH is a strong base. So maybe it's a double elimination, but since it's 1,3-dibromo, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, causing adjacent Br to leave, leading to a double bond.

Wait, but in some cases, when you have two bromines on adjacent carbons (vicinal dihalide), you can eliminate two molecules of HBr to form an alkene. If the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, the structure might allow for two separate eliminations, but perhaps in this case, since the two Br are on the same bridge, maybe the elimination leads to a ring-opening or a new structure.

Wait
