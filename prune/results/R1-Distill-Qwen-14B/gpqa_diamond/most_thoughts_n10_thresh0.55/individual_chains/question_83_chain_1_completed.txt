Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. Let me think through the steps.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I should calculate both values.

First, I think I need to figure out the concentrations after dilution. Oh right, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial moles of acetic acid would be volume (in liters) times molarity. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, multiplied by 0.05 M gives 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles over volume. 0.001 moles / 0.04 L equals 0.025 M. So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, during titration with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. The equivalence volume would help, but maybe I can handle each part separately.

First, the 25% titration point. So 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Let's find out how much NaOH is used.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 moles (from 0.02 L * 0.05 M). 25% of that is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume used is moles divided by concentration: 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. But wait, does this affect the solution's composition?

At 25% titration, part of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. So the solution will have both acetic acid and its conjugate base, making it a buffer solution. To find the pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is around 4.74 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5 - 0.267=4.733, approx 4.74).

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.25)/(0.75) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.74 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.263. That's around 4.26, which matches option A's first value.

Now the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence is determined by the moles of acetate. The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 moles. At equivalence, all are converted to acetate, so 0.001 moles. The total volume is the initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, wait, the NaOH added is 20 cm³? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid initially were 0.001. So moles of NaOH needed are 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So after adding 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is a weak base. Let's calculate the pH using the Kb. The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the [OH^-], and since Kb is small, x^2/(0.02) ≈ Kb. So x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02. Plugging in Kb =5.405e-10, so x^2 = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11. x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5, pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 -4.98 =9.02. Wait, that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check the math again.

Wait, Kb is 5.405e-10, yes. Multiply by 0.02 gives 1.081e-11. Square root is about 1.04e-5, that's correct. pOH is about 4.98, so pH is 9.02. But looking at the options, none have pH near 9.02. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the solution is not considering the dilution properly. Let me recount.

Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M, 40 cm³. At equivalence, we've added enough NaOH to neutralize all of it, which would be 0.001 moles. The volume after adding NaOH is 40 + V_NaOH. The volume of NaOH is V = moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. So total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³=0.05 L.

So acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So that part is correct.

So the calculation for Kb gives pH around 9.02. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C) 4.73; 7.00

D) 4.57; 6.92

Hmm, none have a pH above 8 at equivalence. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should have considered that the solution is 0.02 M acetate, but perhaps I used the wrong concentration. Alternatively, perhaps the volume isn't 50 cm³. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, when you titrate, the NaOH is added to the diluted solution. So the diluted solution is 40 cm³. Then, adding V cm³ of NaOH. So the total volume is 40 + V. But when at equivalence, V is 10 cm³, as I calculated. So 50 cm³ in total. So 0.05 L.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5. So Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10. That's correct.

So Kb =5.405e-10. So the hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The initial concentration is 0.02 M acetate. At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 - x ≈0.02 (since x is small). So Kb = x² / 0.02 =5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5, pOH =4.98, pH=14-4.98=9.02.

Wait, but none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, wait. Oh! Wait a second, when you dilute the acetic acid, I might have made a mistake in the initial concentration calculation. Let me check that again.

Initial solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 moles. Correct.

Then, adding 20 cm³ of water: new volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, but when titrating, the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M. Then we add NaOH. So, when we reach equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. The number of moles of acetate is 0.001, same as initial moles of acetic acid.

But when we add the NaOH, which is 0.001 moles, the volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³.

Wait, another approach: the solution at equivalence is sodium acetate. The concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L=0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps I should make an ICE table for the hydrolysis.

At initial, [CH3COO^-]=0.02 M.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

So Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x^2 =5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x=√(1.081e-11)= ~1.04e-5.

So [OH-] =1.04e-5 → pOH≈4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, but looking at the options, none have pH near 9.02. Wait, the options are A) 4.26; 8.52, B) 3.17;6.73, C)4.73;7.00, D)4.57;6.92.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the volume at equivalence?

Alternatively, perhaps it's not the equivalence point, but I think I did that correctly.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the dilution when adding NaOH. Because when you add NaOH, the solution's volume increases, which affects the concentration.

Wait, another thought: maybe when considering the equivalence point, I should calculate the pH using the concentration of acetate after adding NaOH and considering the dilution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a salt solution.

Wait, another approach: the acetate concentration is 0.02 M. The pH can be found using the formula pH = ½ (pKa + pKb) + something? No, that's not right. Wait, pH is determined by the Kb and the concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact approach without approximation.

So Kb = x^2/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02, so x≈√(5.405e-10 *0.02) as before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the hydrolysis is the only source of OH-.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let's set up the equation.

Let me write Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] =5.405e-10.

Let x be [OH^-]. Then [CH3COOH] is x, and [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x² /0.02 =5.405e-10 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, but this isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part of the problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the amount of NaOH added. Let me recalculate the equivalence point.

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. The NaOH needed is 0.001 mol as well. So volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L (10 cm³). So total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³, 0.05 L. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution is not sodium acetate but something else. No, that's correct. So if none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should have considered that the NaOH is being added to the diluted solution before the titration, but I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial dilution is wrong. Let me double-check.

20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles=0.02 L *0.05 =0.001 mol. Then adding 20 cm³ water, total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 /0.04=0.025 M, correct.

Wait, but if I'm titrating this diluted solution, then at equivalence, the moles of NaOH added is same as moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol). So volume needed is 0.01 L, 10 cm³. So total volume is 40+10=50 cm³.

Wait, so the acetate concentration is 0.001 /0.05 L=0.02 M.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the pH correctly. Let me try again.

The Kb is 5.405e-10. The initial concentration is 0.02 M.

So Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, so 0.02 ≈0.02.

x^2 = 5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But the options don't have that. So what's wrong? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.74.

Kw=1e-14. So Kb =1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) *1e-9= approx 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the solution at equivalence is not 0.02 M. Let me check again.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol.

Total volume: 50 cm³ =0.05 L.

Concentration: 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Wait, perhaps I should look at my first part again. The 25% titration, what did I get?

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.25 *0.001 =0.00025 mol. The volume of NaOH added is 0.00025 /0.1=0.0025 L=2.5 cm³.

The total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

The moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

So concentrations are [HA]=0.00075 /0.0425 ≈0.017647 M.

[A^-]=0.00025 /0.0425≈0.005882 M.

Then, using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is 4.74.

Ratio [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647)=1/3. So log(1/3)= -0.477.

So pH=4.74 -0.477=4.263≈4.26. So the first part is correct, matching option A's first value.

But the equivalence point pH is 9.02, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I should consider the dilution of the solution upon adding NaOH. Wait, but I did that. The total volume is indeed 50 cm³.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is a buffer at equivalence point. No, equivalence is when all acid is neutralized, so it's a pure salt solution.

Wait, maybe the mistake is that the solution at equivalence is not 0.02 M, because perhaps the NaOH and acetic acid don't mix in the way I thought. Let's think, the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. At equivalence, I've added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So the moles of NaOH are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the exact expression, not the approximation.

So, Kb =5.405e-10.

Let me write the equation again: Kb = x^2 / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x^2=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5. So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, I don't see any errors here. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, wait. Oh! Maybe the sodium acetate solution is not 0.02 M. Let me recheck.

At equivalence, the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is indeed 50 cm³, so 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not sodium acetate but something else. No, it's sodium, which is a spectator ion. So the acetate is the only thing affecting the pH.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate using the exact expression to see if the approximation is correct. Let's see.

x^2= Kb*(0.02 -x).

x^2=5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

Approximating gives x=1.04e-5. Let's plug it in:

5.405e-10 * (0.02 -1.04e-5) ≈5.405e-10*(0.0199896) = approx 1.079e-11.

x^2=(1.04e-5)^2=1.0816e-10. Wait, no, wait, 1.04e-5 squared is 1.0816e-10. But 5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11. So x^2=1.081e-11. So x= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

So the approximation holds. So [OH-] is indeed 1.04e-5.

Hmm. So pH is 9.02. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial solution after dilution has a different concentration. Let me check again.

Initial volume of acetic acid:20 cm³=0.02 L, 0.05 M →0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ water, volume is 40 cm³=0.04 L.

Concentration=0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the NaOH needed for equivalence. Wait, no, 0.001 mol NaOH is needed, which is 10 cm³ of 0.1 M.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible options again.

Looking at option D: equivalence point pH is 6.92. That's acidic, which doesn't make sense because sodium acetate should be basic. So probably not.

Option A: equivalence pH is8.52. Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should have used the Ka and the concentration of acetate. Another approach: the pH of sodium acetate can be found using pOH = (pKa + pKb)/2, but that's not correct. Alternatively, using the formula: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]), but at equivalence, there's no HA, only A^-. So that can't be used.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is acetate ion in water, which is a weak base. So I can't use the same approach as a buffer.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I made a mistake in considering that the solution is acetate ion. Wait, no. The equivalence point of a weak acid and strong base is a solution of the conjugate base, which is sodium acetate here.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the initial concentration of the diluted acetic acid, which is 0.025 M, and not considered the equivalence point as being 0.02 M.

Wait, no, equivalence point is when all acetic acid is neutralized, so the moles are 0.001, and the volume is 50 cm³, leading to 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the exact quadratic equation.

So Kb = x² / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Rearranged: x² =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 *0.02)=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -5.405e-10 *0.02= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) = (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) ≈4.324e-11.

Square root of D is approx 6.576e-6.

So x= [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/(2).

Only positive solution: ( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ) /2 ≈ (6.5706e-6)/2=3.285e-6.

So x≈3.285e-6. [OH-]=3.285e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514.

Wait, that's about 8.51. So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.51.

Which matches option A's second value of 8.52.

Ah! So I must have made a mistake earlier in the approximation. So when I used the assumption that x is negligible, it gave me a pH of 9.02, which was incorrect. But using the quadratic equation shows the pH is around 8.52.

So at equivalence, pH is about 8.52. And the 25% titration gave us pH 4.26.

So the correct option is A) 4.26; 8.52.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of diluted acetic acid with NaOH at two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. The key steps are as follows:

---

### **Initial Setup**
1. **Dilution of Acetic Acid**:  
   - Initial volume of acetic acid = 20.00 cm³ = 0.02 L.  
   - Initial concentration of acetic acid = 0.05 M.  
   - Moles of acetic acid = \( 0.02 \, \text{L} \times 0.05 \, \text{M} = 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, total volume = \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L} \).  
   - New concentration of acetic acid = \( \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \).

---

### **25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH.  
- Moles of NaOH added = \( 0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Volume of NaOH added = \( \frac{0.00025 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 \).  
- Total volume of the solution = \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \).  
- Remaining moles of acetic acid (\( \text{HA} \)) = \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Moles of acetate ion (\( \text{A}^- \)) formed = \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Concentrations:  
  \[
  [\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
  \]
  where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.74 \).  
  Substituting:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 4.74 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.74 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.26.
  \]

---

### **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions.  
- Moles of NaOH added = \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Volume of NaOH added = \( \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3 \).  
- Total volume of the solution = \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L} \).  
- Concentration of acetate ions (\( \text{A}^- \)) = \( \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M} \).  
- The solution contains only acetate ions, which act as a weak base. The equilibrium is:  
  \[
  \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
  \]
- The \( \text{K}_b \) for acetate is calculated as:  
  \[
  \text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
  \]
- Using the expression for \( \text{K}_b \):  
  \[
  \text{K}_b = \frac{[\text{OH}^-]^2}{[\text{A}^-]}.
  \]
  Substituting \( [\text{A}^-] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \):  
  \[
  [\text{OH}^-]^2 = \text{K}_b \times [\text{A}^-] = (5.41 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.082 \times 10^{-11}.
  \]
  \[
  [\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{1.082 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
  \]
- \( \text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98 \), so:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
  \]
- However, using a more precise quadratic solution for \( [\text{OH}^-] \), the pH is recalculated to be approximately \( 8.52 \).

---

### **Final Answer**
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately **4.26**, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
