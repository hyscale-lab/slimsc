Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics. Relativity comes into play. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas to use here.

The problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about finding their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, I think I need to tackle the relative speed part. In relativity, you can't just subtract velocities like in classical mechanics because that would sometimes give a speed faster than light, which isn't possible. So I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula, if I recall correctly, is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, no, actually, when both objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of one from the other's frame is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). But wait, I think I might have it backwards. Because if object A is moving at v1 and object B at v2, then from A's frame, B is moving at (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/c²). Or is it the other way around? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let's think. Let me denote the two astronauts as Astronaut 1 (mass 2m) moving at 0.6c, and Astronaut 2 (mass 3m) moving at 0.5c. So from the perspective of Astronaut 1, what is the speed of Astronaut 2? Because both are moving in the same direction, but at different speeds. So the relative velocity would be (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² ). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is (v' )= (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² ), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the original frame. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Let me get this
