Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question is about choosing between two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, they have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right?

Both have circular orbits, which might simplify things because eccentricity can complicate the transit probability. Also, the host stars have different masses but the same radii. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But since their radii are the same, does that affect the transit probability?

I think the transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius and the size of the planet relative to the star. Wait, more specifically, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star) squared times (something else?), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a transit is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but that might not be right. Oh wait, waitâ€”no, the transit probability is the area of the star relative to the planet's orbit. Wait, I think the probability is given by the formula (R_star / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits) is 2/R, where R is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Or wait, no. The probability is equal to the ratio of the star's diameter to the distance of the planet's orbit. Because the planet's orbital plane has to be edge-on for a transit. So the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. Let me recall the formula. Oh right, the probability P is approximately (R_star / a) * (R_planet / R_star), but I'm not sure. Or wait, is it the ratio of R_star to the semi-major axis a?

Wait, another approach. The transit probability (the chance that the planet
