Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO has the given NMR data. Then it's reacted with a series of reagents: first NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH and heat. I need to find out what the final product is from the options given.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I'll look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. Then, I'll think about what each reagent does in the reaction sequence.

Starting with the NMR:

The 1H-NMR shows:
- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)

Wait, I remember that aromatic protons typically appear between 6.5-8.5 ppm. The triplet at 9.72 is quite upfield for an aromatic proton, but wait, could it be something else? Oh wait, maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Aldehydic protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So that triplet might be an aldehyde. But wait, a triplet in that region... Hmm. Or maybe
