Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem gives me some information: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, which I think relates to their temperatures. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their λ_max are the same, their temperatures must be the same too. That makes sense.

Wait, but the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, I'm not sure how radial velocity affects luminosity yet. Oh, wait, but luminosity as computed by the astronomers is based on black body radiation, which depends on radius and temperature. Because luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So for a black body, the luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. 

Since the problem says they computed the luminosity based on black body radiation, I think the radial velocity might not directly affect the calculation here. Unless we're considering some Doppler shift effect on the observed brightness. Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So if their emitted wavelengths are shifted due to Doppler, but the observed peak is same. So if Star_2 is moving away (or towards, but radial velocity is given as 700 km/s), but both have same observed λ_max. Hmm, that complicates things. Let me think.

Wait, but the problem states that the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe the radial velocities are accounted for in terms of redshift or blueshift. So for Star_2, moving at 700 km/s, perhaps its observed wavelength is shifted. But since both stars have same observed λ_max, that would imply that the temperature as seen from Earth would be the same? Or maybe the rest frame temperatures are different, but the observed ones are same. Hmm, but that might complicate things
