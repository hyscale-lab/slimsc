Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about titration of acetic acid. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I'll think about what happens when you dilute the acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we add water, it'll dissociate a bit more. But since it's diluted, the concentration of H+ will decrease, so the pH should go up a bit.

Wait, but what's the initial concentration before dilution? The initial solution is 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution will be half of 0.05 M, which is 0.025 M. Because when you double the volume, the concentration halves. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, so it'll react completely with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

So, the stoichiometry is 1:1. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid initially present.

Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), concentration 0.025 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will be 0.001 moles. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is (moles)/(Molarity) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So, at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added, that's 25% titration.

Now, I need to find pH at 25% and equivalence.

Let me start with the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point needs to be determined. The total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ (0.05 L). The moles of acetate are 0.001, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found from the Ka of acetic acid. Since Kw = Ka × Kb, so Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction's Kb is small, so we can approximate. Let's set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], and initial concentration is 0.02 M.

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486. So pH = 14 - 5.486 ≈ 8.514. Hmm, but wait, let me think. I might have miscalculated the Kb.

Wait, let me compute Kb again. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. That seems right.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Square root is about 3.288e-6. pOH is about 5.48, pH is 8.52. So equivalence point pH is around 8.52.

Looking at the options: option A says 4.26 and 8.52, so maybe A is a possibility. But let me check the 25% titration.
