Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions, especially in its core. The pp chain is a major one, right? So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. Interesting.

So, the problem is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find the ratio of their fluxes, flux1/flux2.

First, I should recall what the pp-III branch produces. Oh right, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, which is the dominant fusion process in the Sun. The pp-III reactions involve higher temperatures and produce boron-8 (B-8) as an intermediate. B-8 then decays into two helium-3 nuclei, but more importantly, it emits neutrinos, specifically electron neutrinos (ν_e) via the decay B-8 → Be-8 + e+ + ν_e.

Wait, so if the pp-III branch stops, that would mean that the production of B-8 and hence the ν_e from that decay would stop. But wait, the problem says all other reactions remain as they were. So maybe other branches like the pp-I and pp-II are still running? Or perhaps the main
