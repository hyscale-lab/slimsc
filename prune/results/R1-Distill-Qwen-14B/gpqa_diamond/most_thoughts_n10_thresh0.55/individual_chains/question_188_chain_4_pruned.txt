Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that interplanar distances are related to the unit cell dimensions and the Miller indices.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where all the edges are of equal length, but the angles between them aren't necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal usually refers to the lattice parameter, like 'a' in a cubic system. So probably, in a rhombohedral crystal, all the edges 'a' are the same, and the angles are all 30 degrees.

I need to find the interplanar distance d for the (111) plane. The formula I remember is from the Bragg's law context, where d = lattice parameter / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) * something involving the angles ). Oh wait, more accurately, the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ), but wait, no, I think rhombohedral has the same angles, so maybe cos α is the same for all terms. Alternatively, I remember that for a general
