Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about angular momentum operators and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Hmm, let me try to remember what I know. 

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and determine which statement is correct among the options.

First, let me think about what S is. Oh wait, S looks a lot like the Pauli matrices. The Pauli Y matrix is usually written as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by some factor. 

Wait, no, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So yes, S is σy. Since A_y equals c·S, and c is h/(4π), I can write A_y as (h/(4π)) * σy.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0. Let me compute this.

So the matrix A_y is:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 , (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*(i) , (h/(4π))*0 ]

So that's:

[ 0 , -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), 0 ]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy the equation:

| -λ       -i h/(4π)  |
| i h/(4π)   -λ      | = 0

So the determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) = λ² - (i² (h/(4π))² )

But i squared is -1, so this becomes λ² + (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

Wait, that's λ² = - (h²/(16 π²)).

Taking square roots, λ = ± [ h/(4π) * i ]? Wait no, wait, wait. Let me do that again.

Wait, no, because i is the imaginary unit. So the equation
