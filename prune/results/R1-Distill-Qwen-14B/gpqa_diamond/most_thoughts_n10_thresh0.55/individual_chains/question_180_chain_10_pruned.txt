Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I guess I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just the potential energy part. 

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. So I think the key here is to figure out the electric potential energy of the system. Since all the charges are the same, the interactions between each pair will contribute to the total potential energy.

Wait, but how do I calculate the potential energy for a system of multiple charges? I remember that the electric potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

In this case, since all the 12 charges are at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P, each of the 12 charges will interact with the charge at P. Also, the 12 charges are probably fixed in their positions relative to point P, but they might not be moving relative to each other. Wait, but the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P, so I think their distances from each other aren't specified. Hmm, that's a problem because if they are all at the same distance from P, but their mutual distances could vary, but perhaps in the minimum energy case, we can consider that the charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized. But wait, the problem is only asking about the minimum energy of the system, which I think refers to the potential energy. 

Wait, wait. Let me think again. So the system consists of 13 charges. One is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P.

Now, the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. So for each pair of charges, I'll calculate the potential energy and then sum them all up.

But wait, the 13th charge (at P) interacts with each of the 12 others. So each of those 12 charges will contribute a term with the 13th. Also, the 12 charges at 2m from P may form their own system, so the potential energy between each pair among those 12 also contributes.

But wait, the problem says the system is isolated, so energy considerations are just about the potential energies between all pairs.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of:

1. The potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th (fixed at P).

Plus

2. The potential energy between each pair among the 12 charges.

So I need to calculate both parts.

Wait, but how are the 12 charges arranged? Because their mutual distances affect the potential energy. If they are all at 2m from P, perhaps they are arranged in a spherical shell around P. But without knowing their exact positions, it's tricky. But the problem might be making an assumption here. Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So perhaps they're all at the same distance from P but arranged in a way that their mutual distances are as small as possible? No, that's not necessarily the case. Or maybe the problem is only considering the interactions with the fixed charge and not the interactions among the 12? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges
