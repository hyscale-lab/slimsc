Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the question gives some info about the brightness each spectrograph can observe. ESPRESSO can detect stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, noâ€”wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag", which means the V magnitude is less than 17, right? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So ESPRESSO can observe stars up to V=17.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So it's up to V=16. So what that means is, for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have a V magnitude less than 17 (since ESPRESSO can only go up to 17) and less than 16 (since HIRES can't go beyond 16). Oh wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me clarify: if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's V <17. And for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag, so V <16. So a star that's brighter than 16 mag (so V <16) can be seen by both. Because if it's V=16, HIRES can't, but wait, what's the exact wording? The question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO" and "brighter than 16 mag can be observed with HIRES." So for a star to be detected by both, it's V must be brighter than both 17 and 16. Wait, no, because to be detected by ESPRESSO, the V must be <=17, and for HIRES, V must be <=16.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Oh, wait, magnitude scales are counterintuitive. Wait, higher magnitude means fainter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its V magnitude is less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, it can see stars up to V=17
