Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about density matrices. Hmm, the question gives me a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are four different points in a 3D space: (1,1,0), (0,0,1), (0,0,0), and (1,1,1).

Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. A pure state is a density matrix that's a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But this ρ here is 1/2 times (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh wait, that looks familiar. Isn't that the maximally mixed state for a qubit?

So, a qubit is a two-level system, and the space of density matrices is 3-dimensional because the density matrix is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix with trace one. The general form of a density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector r describes the state in terms of its components along the x, y, and z axes.

The formula I recall is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Let me write that out. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So ρ would be (I + (r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz )) / 2.

Wait, in this problem, the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨
