Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Both planets are detected using the RV method, which I remember stands for radial velocity. The question gives me some data about the spectral line shifts of their host stars.

Let me think about what I know about the radial velocity method. The RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little in response to the planet's orbit. The size of the shift depends on the mass of the planet and the characteristics of the orbit, including the period.

The problem states that both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each planet has a mass similar to Neptune, so their masses are about the same. The planets are in circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does the shift relate to the orbital period? Oh right, the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's orbital period.

The velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star's orbit is given by the formula:

K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since e is zero for circular orbits (as given), that simplifies the equation. Also, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, which is similar to the Sun, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so M_* is the mass of the star, which is the same for both planets.

Wait, but in the RV method, the measured velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ). But since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses (same as Neptune), and assuming the inclination angles i are the same (since the shifts are given as periodic, maybe they're edge-on, so sin i is 1), then K should be inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, let's rethink that. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2π G ) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) )

Since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (2π G ) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) )

But again, if sin i is the same for both (since they have similar observed shifts, maybe they are both edge-on), and M_p and M_* are same for both planets, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). 

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, let's think about that. If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is some constant based on the other factors (which are same for both planets). 

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). 

Alternatively, K1 = (C) / P1^(1/3) → P1^(1/3) = C / K1 → P1 = (C/K1)^3.

Similarly, P2 = (C/K2)^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 = ( (C/K2)^3 ) / ( (C/K1)^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me double-check:

P2 = (C/K2)^3 → P2 = (C^3)/(K2^3)
P1 = (
