Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given for four different complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. They're asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, wait, I remember that stability constants are about how much a complex forms. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the higher β, the more the complex forms with the ligand.

The complexes are Co(SCN)_n^2+ where n is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4? Or maybe the βs go up to n=4. Wait, the βs are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So each β corresponds to the complex with that many SCN- ions? Like β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)₂]^0, etc. Wait, no, the charge would change based on the number of SCN- attached.

Wait, Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So for n SCN- ions, the complex charge would be 2 - n. So for [Co(SCN)]^+, n=1, charge is +2 -1 = +1. For [Co(SCN)₂]^0, n=2, charge is 0, and so on.

But I'm not sure if that's important for this problem. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think dithiocyanato means two SCN- ions attached. So that's [Co(SCN)₂]^0, which would have β2=40. Wait, but wait, the βs are given as β1, β2, etc. So β2 is for the complex with two SCN- ions.

But wait, the percentage is about all cobalt species. So we need to find the distribution of all possible Co complexes, including the free ion, and the various complexes up to n=
