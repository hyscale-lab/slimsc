Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. So the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Hmm, first, I need to understand what the operator P is. Wait, the problem gives me the components P_x, P_y, and P_z. So the operator P must be a vector operator made from these components. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, operators can be vectors, so P would be like the sum of these components multiplied by their respective unit vectors. But wait, the direction is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, that means n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Or wait, sometimes it's the other way around. Let me think: in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, so yeah, n would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ)? Wait no, wait, the direction is in the x-z plane, so φ is zero because it's in the x-z plane. So φ is 0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, maybe it's just θ that matters here.

Wait, no, maybe the direction n is in the x-z plane, so the angle φ is zero.
