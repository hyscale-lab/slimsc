Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think through it. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped hypothetically about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions remain the same. We need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core converting hydrogen into helium. The pp-I, II, III branches are different pathways in this chain. The pp-III branch is one of the key steps in producing helium, I think.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the fusion of two helium-3 ions (He-3) to form a He-4 nucleus. The reaction is He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2 protons. But wait, that's the main reaction—so if the pp-III branch stops, that would affect the production of certain neutrinos, right?

I think solar neutrinos are mainly produced in two processes: the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. The main neutrinos from the pp chain are the electron neutrinos emitted during the beta decay steps. The CNO cycle contributes a bit less.

Wait
