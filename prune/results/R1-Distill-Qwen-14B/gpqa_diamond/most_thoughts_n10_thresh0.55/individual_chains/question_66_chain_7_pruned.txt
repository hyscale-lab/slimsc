Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are four points: Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. And the choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I know about these symmetries? Let me think. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, so like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations, so it's a bigger symmetry group. Oh, wait, Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations, so if Lorentz is required, Poincare must also be. Because all operators in SMEFT must respect the Poincare symmetry since it's part of the framework.

Wait, but SMEFT is an effective theory built from the Standard Model. The Standard Model itself respects these symmetries. So the effective operators, which are higher-dimensional, should also respect the same symmetries as the SM.

So Lorentz is definitely a must. Because the SM is Lorentz invariant, so SMEFT operators must preserve that. So point 1 is correct.

What about Poincare? Since Poincare includes translations, which implies momentum conservation. I think all terms in the Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant. So operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare. So points 1 and 2 would be correct.

But wait,
