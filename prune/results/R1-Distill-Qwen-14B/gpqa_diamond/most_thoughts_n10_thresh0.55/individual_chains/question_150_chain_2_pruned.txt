Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. Alright, let's break this down.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Each degree is either a ring or a double bond. The formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down: for each molecule, the degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, but here it's O, so maybe I should adjust.

Wait, I think the formula is Degree of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 => (18 -9)/2 = 9/2=4.5. That can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. 2*8 is 16, plus 2 is 18. Then subtract H=9: 18-9=9. Then plus N=1 (since it's treated as -1?), wait no, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So N is +1. So 9 +1=10? So 10/2=5 degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, that still gives 5, which is a whole number. Okay, so 5 degrees. That would mean a combination of rings and double bonds. Let's see: 5 could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds and a ring, so 4 degrees) plus another ring or another double bond, but wait, benzene is 3 double bonds and one ring for a total of 4. So the fifth would be another double bond or a ring.

Looking at the NMR data: There's a triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H), which is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as a sharp peak, often a singlet or triplet. The triplet might be because it's adjacent to a CH2 group or something with two protons.

Then
