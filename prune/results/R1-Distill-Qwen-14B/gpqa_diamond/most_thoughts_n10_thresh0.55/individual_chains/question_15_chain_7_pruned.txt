Okay, let me try to think through this problem. So, the question is about which planet is more likely to transit from the perspective of Earth, so the researchers should choose to observe the one with a higher probability of transiting. Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the radial velocity method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known.

The information given is that Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet_2—three times shorter, so P1 is P2/3. Both have circular orbits. The stars have the same radii, but the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Wait, same radii but different masses. Oh, so the host stars have the same radius but different masses. Interesting.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. Also, the orbital distance affects the probability because the chance is higher if the planet's orbit is more likely to cross our line of sight.

The formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (R_star + a)) where 'a' is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, I think the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 - e^2))^(1/2), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term is 1. So the main factors are the planet size and the star size, and the distance of the planet's orbit.

But wait, the probability also depends on the inclination of the orbit. The probability that the orbit is aligned so that it transits is given by the formula (R_s + R_p) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. But if the semi-major axis is larger, the probability is lower because the planet's orbit is more likely to miss our line of sight.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for the transit probability, which is:

P_transit ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a)^2 )) ?

No, I think I'm confusing some terms. Let me recall the correct formula.

The transit probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a)^2 )) ?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The main factor for the transit probability is the chance that
