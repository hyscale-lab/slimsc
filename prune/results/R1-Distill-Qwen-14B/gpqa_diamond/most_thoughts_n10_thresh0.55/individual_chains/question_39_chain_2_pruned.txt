Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function given some conditions.

Alright, the wave function provided is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second, wave functions in quantum mechanics are usually complex, right? So this makes sense. The real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

But then the problem says that when they measured the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3. So that means the probability of finding the particle is zero outside the interval [1,3]. I think that implies that the wave function must be zero outside this region. Or wait, does it? Or perhaps the wave function is non-zero only in that region, so the probability density is zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but if x is less than 1, say x=0, then 1+x=1, so the denominator is 1. But when x is greater than 3, maybe it's something else. But the condition is that the particle is found only between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside this range? Or maybe the given wave function is valid only in that region. Hmm.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased says that the wave function of each particle in a part of space where it can exist is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe the wave function is non-zero only in a specific region, perhaps where x is between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe the wave function is non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But for the wave function to be zero outside, perhaps the given expression is only valid in that region. Alternatively, maybe the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, implying that the square of the absolute value (the probability density) is zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let's compute its absolute square. The absolute value squared of a complex number z = p + qi is p² + q². So here
