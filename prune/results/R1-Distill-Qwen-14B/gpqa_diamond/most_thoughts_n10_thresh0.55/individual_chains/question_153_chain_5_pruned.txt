Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think about each part step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and products for each, then match them with the given options.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, right? It's a diester, so it can act as the enolate donor. The other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the electrophilic component.

In a Michael addition, the enolate (from the donor) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the donor (malonate) will donate its enolate to the acceptor (acrylate). Let me draw this out. The acrylate has a structure where the double bond is between C2 and C3, with a p-tolyl group on C3. So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks, it'll add to the beta carbon (C3) of the acrylate.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula might be methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2-C(O)OCH3, but wait, maybe it's actually CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the substituent on the third carbon. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, acrylate would be CH2=CHCOOEt, but the substituent is on the third carbon, so it's probably CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. So the structure is CH2=CH–C(p-tolyl)–OEt, but wait, wait, the correct IUPAC name is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is
