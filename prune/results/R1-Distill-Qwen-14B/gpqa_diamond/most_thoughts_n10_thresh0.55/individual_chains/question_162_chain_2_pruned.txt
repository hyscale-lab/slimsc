Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to break this down step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, wait. So this looks like a two-dimensional metric, right? Because the differentials are dx² and dy². So we're probably dealing with a 2D spacetime here, but maybe it's embedded in a higher-dimensional space? Or maybe it's just a 2D surface.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Pseudosphere—oh right, that's like a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, what's the area of a pseudosphere? I remember that for a regular sphere in 3D, the surface area is 4πr². But pseudosphere is different because of its negative curvature. But wait, maybe in this context, the pseudosphere's area is considered in a specific way.

Wait, but the metric here is given in terms of x and y. So perhaps this metric describes a 2D space, and the pseudosphere is a surface embedded in that space. Alternatively, maybe the metric is representing the pseudosphere's geometry.

Wait, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me think about the form. So the denominator (4 - x² - y²) suggests that the maximum x² + y² can be is 4. Because when x² + y² approaches
