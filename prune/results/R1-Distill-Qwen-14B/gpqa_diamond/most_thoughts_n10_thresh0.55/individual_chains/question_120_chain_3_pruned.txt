Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed. That probably means that the number density of stars is constant in all directions. Wait, uniform distribution usually implies that the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere. So, if I imagine a sphere with radius r (which would be distance d, since d = 1/plx where plx is parallax), the number of stars in that sphere would depend on the volume.

Wait, right, the parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. So, for a given parallax range, like plx to plx + dplx, how does the number of stars in that range depend on plx itself?

Let me rephrase. The number of stars per unit range of parallax (dplx) would be the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx. Since the distribution is uniform in space, the number density (n) is constant.

The number of stars in a spherical shell between distances d and d + dd (where dd is a small change in distance) would be n multiplied by the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in that shell, dN = n * 4π d² dd.

But since we're dealing with parallax, which is plx = 1/d, I can rewrite d in terms of plx. Let's see, d = 1/plx. So dd is the derivative of d with respect to plx. Let me think: if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides with respect to plx: dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx. But since we're considering a small positive range, maybe I can just take the absolute value, so dd = (1/plx^2) dplx.

Putting that into the expression for dN: dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx. Wait wait, no. Wait, the shell's volume is 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (1/plx^2) dplx, we get:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, that would make dN proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx. But wait, that doesn't quite sound right. Let me double-check.

Another approach: Since the number of stars is uniform in space, the number per unit volume is n. So, for a given parallax range, I need to find how many stars are in that range.

Let's think in terms of plx. The parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx corresponds to a range of distance from d = 1/plx to d = 1/(plx + dplx) approximately, but for small dplx, it's approximately d to d - (dd). Wait, maybe it's better to express the volume in terms of plx.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the number of stars per unit
