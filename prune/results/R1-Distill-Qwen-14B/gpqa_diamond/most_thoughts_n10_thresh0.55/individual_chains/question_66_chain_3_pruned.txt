Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries are those?

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are 1,2,3,4 combinations.

Let me think about each symmetry. Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Because in the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz invariance. Operators in SMEFT are constructed from the SM fields, so they must preserve this symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry is a must, which is option 1.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space or time). But wait, in effective field theories, you usually work in a certain frame, right? Because EFTs are low-energy approximations. If the theory is formulated in a specific frame, then Poincare symmetry might not be required. Or maybe SMEFT is formulated in a way that respects it. Wait, I think that in SMEFT, you can have operators that are not Poincare invariant because they might have terms that don't respect translations, like operators with higher derivatives or certain insertions. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Because in the standard formulation, SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry but not necessarily Poincare. Because Poincare includes things like momentum conservation, which might not be preserved if you have
