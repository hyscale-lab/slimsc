Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it again carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product. The options given are A, B, C, D. I'm also provided with IR and NMR data for Compound X. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in what's called the Hinsberg reaction. Oh right, the Hinsberg reaction is used to determine if a compound is an amine, and whether it's primary, secondary, or tertiary. But wait, wait, in this case, Compound X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. So maybe it's not the Hinsberg test. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI might be used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and Hg, not red phosphorus. Oh right, the other possibility is that red phosphorus and HI are used to reduce a carbonyl group. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh wait, the reaction of a carbonyl with excess red phosphorus and HI is typically used to convert ketones or aldehydes into alkanes via the Wittig reaction. Or wait, noâ€”the Wittig reagent is usually prepared with triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI might be part of the
