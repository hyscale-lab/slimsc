Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll think it through.

The problem says there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the second has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. So the question is asking two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy. Oh, right, I remember that in relativity, things aren't as straightforward as classical mechanics. So for relative velocity, I can't just subtract the speeds. I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, but wait. The velocity addition formula, right. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), where u is the velocity of one object as seen from the other's frame. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Suppose astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's velocity?

Wait no, wait. The problem is asking for the relative speed. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving slower. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Wait, no, wait, because u is the velocity of B in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of A in the lab frame. Or wait, no—actually, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify.

Actually, the velocity addition formula is when you have two velocities u and v in the same frame, and you want to find the relative velocity between the two objects when observed from another frame. Hmm, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me recall the formula: if one object (B) is moving at velocity u in the lab frame (where another object A is moving at velocity v), then the velocity of B as seen from A's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). So in this case, u is 0.5c
