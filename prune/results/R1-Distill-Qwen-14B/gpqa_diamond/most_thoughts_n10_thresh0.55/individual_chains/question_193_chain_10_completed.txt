Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with the parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, the formula is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, distance r = 1/plx. 

Wait, so if the number of stars varies with 1/plx^5, I need to find how the number changes with distance. Let me write down what I know. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5.

But I need to express this in terms of distance r. Since r = 1/plx, I can solve for plx in terms of r. plx = 1/r. Substituting that into the equation for N, I get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5.

Let me compute that exponent. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5. So, 1 divided by that would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). So, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. That would mean that as the distance increases, the number of stars increases much more rapidly.

Looking back at the options, option B is ~ r^5. So that should be the correct answer.

Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution: plx is 1/r, so (plx)^5 is (1/r)^5. So, 1/(plx)^5 becomes 1/(1/r^5) which is r^5. Yep, that makes sense. So the number of stars increases as r^5. So the answer must be B.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax is related to distance (\( r \)) by the formula \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), which implies \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5
\]

Thus, the number of stars is proportional to \( r^5 \). This means that as the distance \( r \) increases, the number of stars in the region grows rapidly with distance. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( r^3 \)**  
**B) ~ \( r^5 \)**  
**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**  
**D) ~ \( r^2 \)**  

The correct choice is **B**, as \( N \propto r^5 \).

Answer: B
