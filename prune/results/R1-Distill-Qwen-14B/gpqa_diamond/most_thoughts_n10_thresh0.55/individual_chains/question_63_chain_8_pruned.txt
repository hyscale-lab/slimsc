Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. The question is about what photon momentum is needed for the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state when it's in the fundamental state.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state. But which state is that? The next higher energy state would probably involve some quantum number changes. For a diatomic molecule modeled with rotation and vibration, I think the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the state with the lowest possible energy. But in the quantum model, for a diatomic, the fundamental state would be the state where both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their lowest. Oh wait, in the vibration-rotation model, the vibrational state is n=0 (ground state), and the rotational state is also the lowest, which is J=0 or J=1? Wait, no, the rigid rotor model's ground state is J=0, but the non-rigid might have a bit more complexity, but maybe here it's similar.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So the fundamental state is probably the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when it absorbs a photon, it must transition to the next higher energy state. But what transitions are allowed? I think in vibrational transitions, the selection rule is Δn = ±1, but for rotational, it's ΔJ = ±1. But wait, in the vibration-rotation model, the energy levels are a combination of both. So maybe the photon causes a transition that involves a change in either vibration or rotation, or both.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy. So the next state could be either the next vibrational state (n=1) or the next rotational state (J=1). Or maybe a combination of both. But the question is about the photon's momentum, so perhaps the energy of the photon is the energy difference between these states.

But which transition gives the smallest possible energy change? Because the question asks for the photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the question says what momentum should the photon have so the molecule
