Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, mathematically, that would be N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). The options are A to D, involving different exponents of r.

Hmm, okay, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle subtended by the distance to an object when observed from two points. The formula I recall is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance in parsecs.

Wait, wait, so plx is inversely proportional to r. So if I have plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. That's important because the number of stars N is given as proportional to 1/(plx^5). So let's substitute r into that.

So N ∝ 1/(plx^5), and since plx = 1/r, plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/(r^5). So 1/(plx^5) becomes r^5. So N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question isn't directly asking for N as a function of r, it's asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm, so maybe it's about the density or the rate of change of N with r.

Wait, let me think. The number of stars per unit volume or per some range of distance? Oh, wait, the way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Oh, so perhaps the number of stars is a function of the distance r. So when r increases, how does N vary? From the earlier substitution, N is proportional to r^5. So if r increases, N increases as r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's write the steps:

Given:
N ∝ 1/(plx)^5

And plx =
