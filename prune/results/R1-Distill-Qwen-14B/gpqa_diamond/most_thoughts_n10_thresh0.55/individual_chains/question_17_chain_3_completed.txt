Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mention that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the conditions are such that the EDTA is in its proper form to complex with calcium. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant tells us about the stability of that complex.

So, I'm trying to recall what I know about this. The Ca-EDTA complex is [CaEDTA]^2-, right? And the formation constant (K) for this complex is given. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the complex. The reaction would be something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ [CaEDTA]^2-

The formation constant K is equal to [ [CaEDTA]^2- ] divided by ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). So K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]}.

But wait, the problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M. The question is asking for [Ca²+], the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Wait, but if the complex is completely formed, wouldn't the free calcium ions be negligible? Because EDTA is a strong chelating agent, especially with a high formation constant like 5e10, which is pretty large. So the complex is very stable, meaning that the majority of Ca²+ ions are bound by EDTA, leaving a very small concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

But how do I calculate that? I think I can use the formation constant expression. Let me denote [Ca²+] as x. Then, since the complex is 0.02 M, but wait, when the complex dissociates, each mole of complex releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So, I think I should consider the total concentration of Ca and EDTA species.

Wait, but wait, the total concentration of calcium species comes from the dissociation of the complex. So, the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So, at equilibrium, the concentration of complex is 0.02 - x (but wait, x would be the amount dissociated? Wait, perhaps I should model this properly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to assume that the concentration of [CaEDTA]^2- is 0.02 M, and the K is given, so we can set up the equation and solve for [Ca²+].

Let me structure this:

The formation constant K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Assuming that the solution is such that the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA is the dissociation of the complex. So, the total EDTA is from the complex and any free EDTA. Wait, but wait, the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, so for every mole of [CaEDTA]^2- that dissociates, one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4- are produced.

So, let me denote the concentration of [Ca²+] as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, because each dissociation gives one mole each. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 - x. But wait, if x is very small compared to 0.02, then 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Because K is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable, so x would be really small. So the approximation could work.

So substituting into the K expression:

K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So, 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Rearranging, x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/(5)) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

So x squared is 0.4e-12. Taking square root: x = sqrt(0.4e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) because 0.4 is 4e-1. Hmm, wait, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, but wait, 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2? Wait, 2e-6 squared is 4e-12. Hmm, wait, no, let me double-check.

Wait, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13. The square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5? Wait, no, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. Square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. Because sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, so sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7 approximately.

Wait, but 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

Oh wait, because 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So the square root is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer. But wait, let me think again. Did I make any mistakes in the setup?

Wait, the assumption was that the concentration of EDTA^4- is x. But in reality, EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. The problem states that pH is ideal, so perhaps it's at the optimal pH where EDTA exists as Y^4-. So that's why I can assume [EDTA^4-] is x. So that part is okay.

So the calculation seems right. Thus, the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant expression:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is given as 0.02 M. Assuming the pH is ideal, EDTA exists as \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), and the dissociation of the complex releases one \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and one \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) per complex. Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) be \(x\). Then, the concentration of \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) is also \(x\), and the concentration of the complex is approximately \(0.02 - x \approx 0.02\) (since \(x\) is expected to be very small due to the large \(K\)).

Substituting into the formation constant expression:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
