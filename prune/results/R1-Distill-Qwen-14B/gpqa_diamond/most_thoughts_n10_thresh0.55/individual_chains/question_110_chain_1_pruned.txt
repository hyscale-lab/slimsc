Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. They can observe stars based on their brightness, right? The question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait. Oh no, wait. Wait, the way it's phrased is "brighter than 17 mag" meaning the magnitude is less than 17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, ESPRESSO can see stars up to V=17. But wait, I think I need to double-check: if a star is brighter than 17, that means it's magnitude is less than 17, correct. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V ≤17.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So stars with V ≤16 can be seen by HIRES. But wait, is this apparent magnitude or absolute? I think it must be apparent magnitude because the brightness detectable is based on how bright they appear to us, not their intrinsic brightness.

So, the question is which stars have apparent V magnitudes that are ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and some stars might be detected by both if their apparent magnitude is within both limits. Because HIRES can only go up to 16,
