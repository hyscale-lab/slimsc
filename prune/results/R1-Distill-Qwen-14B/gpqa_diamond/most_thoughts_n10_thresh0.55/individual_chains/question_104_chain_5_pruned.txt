Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method.

The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull, right? So the star moves a bit, and we see shifts in the wavelengths of the spectral lines. The amount of shift depends on the star's velocity towards or away from us.

Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method detects the velocity of the star, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula that comes to mind is something like the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ), but maybe I should think more simply.

Alternatively, a key relationship is that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( (M_p / M_star) ) * ( (P) )^(-1/3) ), assuming the orbit is circular and edge-on (so sin i = 1). But wait, since the problem doesn't specify inclination, but both are similar, maybe it's assuming similar inclinations or that sin i is the same for both, so we can ignore it.

Wait, but I think the exact formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * P) / (2π) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star (because Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So that simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * P ) / (2π) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2
