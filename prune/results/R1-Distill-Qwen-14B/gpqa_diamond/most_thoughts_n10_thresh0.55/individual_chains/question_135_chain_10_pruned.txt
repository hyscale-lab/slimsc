Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think this is describing the interaction between the boson X and the fermion ψ_f. So the interaction term would be λ f ψ̄_f X ψ_f, ignoring the v for decay processes because v is a constant like the vacuum expectation value, which might not play a role in the decay kinematics directly.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermions X can decay into.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be greater than twice the mass of the fermion. Because each fermion has to have some energy, so m_X must be > 2m_fermion. So, the decays are allowed if the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. All the fermions I know are much lighter than that. Let me list the masses of the known fermions:

- Up quark: about 2.2 MeV
- Down quark: around 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark: ~100 MeV
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.7 GeV
- Top quark: way too heavy, like 173 GeV.
- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon: ~0.105 GeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV
- The neutrinos are even lighter, like less than 1 MeV each.

Wait, but for charged leptons, let's see. Let me list their masses again:

Electron: ~0.000511 GeV
Muon: ~0.1057 GeV
Tau: ~1.777 GeV

And for quarks, the current masses (roughly):

u: ~1.5 MeV (but sometimes considered lighter, like 2-3 MeV)
d: ~3-5 MeV
s: ~95-100 MeV
c: ~1.2-1.5 GeV
b: ~4.1-5 GeV (I think around 4.5 GeV on average)
t: ~173 GeV (way too heavy)

So the X boson is 6 GeV. So for fermion pairs, 2m_f must be less than 6 GeV.

So, any fermion with m_f < 3 GeV can be produced as a pair.

Looking at the fermions:

- Up quarks: way below, so yes.
- Down: same, yes.
- Strange: 100 MeV, yes.
- Charm: 1.5 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV, so yeah.
- Bottom: about 4.5 GeV, so 2m_b is 9 GeV which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay to b b-bar.
Wait, wait, but 4.5 GeV is the mass of a bottom quark. So 6 GeV is the X mass. 2 * 4.5 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b quark pairs.

Wait, but wait. The X is a boson, when it decays into fermions, it can't just decay into any fermion, but the interaction term in the Lagrangian determines which fermions it can decay
