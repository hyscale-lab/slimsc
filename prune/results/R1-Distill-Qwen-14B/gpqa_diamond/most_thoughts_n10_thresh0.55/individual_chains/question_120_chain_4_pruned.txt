Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. The formula I think is distance d = 1 / plx, where plx is in parsecs. Oh right, the parallax in arcseconds. So the larger the parallax, the closer the star is because the shift is bigger when you're closer.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Wait, it's per unit range, so I guess it's the density of stars in a given parallax interval. Like, how many stars are there when you look at a slice of the sky with parallax between plx and plx + dplx.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their number density in 3D space is constant. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume itself. But how does that relate to parallax?

Let me think in terms of distance. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. If I have a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance?

Let's solve for distance. If plx is p, then d = 1/p. So when plx increases by dplx, the distance decreases by some amount. Let me compute the change in distance. d = 1/p, so dd = -1/(p^2) dplx. The negative sign here just indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases, but I'll probably just take the magnitude for this problem.

But wait, maybe I should think about the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume V of a shell is 4πd² dd. But wait, if the number density of stars is uniform, then the number of stars in this shell would be n * V, where n is the number density.

But how does this relate to parallax? Let's substitute d in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, dd = - d^2 dplx. Wait, no, wait. Let's go step by step.

d = 1/p, so when p increases by a small amount dp, d decreases by (d^2) dp. Because differentiating d with respect to p: dd = - (1
