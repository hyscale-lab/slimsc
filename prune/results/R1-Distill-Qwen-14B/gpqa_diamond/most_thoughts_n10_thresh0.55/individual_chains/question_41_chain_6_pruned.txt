Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about light propagating through a glass slab. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and it's moving towards the observer. The observer is in the laboratory frame. The question is asking for the speed of light relative to the observer. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm. So, the glass has an index of refraction n. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, this glass is moving. How does that affect the speed of light in the lab frame?

Wait, the problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer. So, the beam is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving in that direction too. But the light is inside the glass. So, the glass's motion might affect the observed speed of the light.

I think this is a problem involving the addition of velocities, perhaps using special relativity. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add velocities classically; you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but in this case, the glass is moving, but the light is inside it. So, the speed of light in the glass (in its rest frame) is c/n. But from the lab frame, what's its speed?

Wait, no, because in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So, the light's speed in the glass's frame is c/n. But we need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

So, let me think. The velocity addition formula in special relativity is (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(cÂ²)), right? Where u is the velocity of the object in the first frame, and v is the velocity of the first frame relative to the second.

Wait, but in this case, the light is moving at u = c/n in the glass's rest frame. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So, the lab frame is the second frame, and the glass's rest frame is the first.

Wait, no, wait. I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So, from the lab frame, the glass is moving with speed v. The light is moving
