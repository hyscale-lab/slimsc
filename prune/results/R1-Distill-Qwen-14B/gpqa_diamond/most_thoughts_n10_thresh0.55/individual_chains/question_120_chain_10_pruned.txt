Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance. But how does that tie into the number of stars?

Wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax range. So if I imagine a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range? And how does this number change as plx changes.

I think I should model this with some math. Let's say the distribution of stars is uniform in terms of distance, or maybe in terms of volume. Wait, in reality, stars are not uniformly distributed because the galaxy has structure, but the problem states to assume uniform distribution, so maybe it's uniform in all directions and spread out in space.

Wait, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density is constant. So n(r) dr is the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr. But wait, the question is about parallax, so I need to relate this to parallax.

Parallax (plx) is given by plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So d = 1/plx. When plx increases, distance decreases.

So for a given parallax plx, the distance is d = 1/plx. The next step is to find the range of distances corresponding to a small change in plx, like from plx to plx + d
