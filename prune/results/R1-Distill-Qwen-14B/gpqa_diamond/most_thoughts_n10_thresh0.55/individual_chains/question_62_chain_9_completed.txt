Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, the main structure is two cyclohexane rings. One of them has a methyl group attached, and that methyl group is connected to a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane ring. Also, there's a carbonyl group (the aldehyde) at position 1 of the cyclohexane. 

Wait, I think the structure is like this: the cyclohexane ring has a CH2-OH group attached, and that CH2 is also connected to another cyclohexane. And on the same ring as the aldehyde (the carbaldehyde), so the aldehyde is on a cyclohexane that's connected to this other group.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, structure-wise, it's CH2-C≡CH connected to a cyclohexane ring.

I need to figure out the reagents that will take ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. The options are A, B, C, D. Each option gives a series of reactions.

Let me think about the possible steps involved.

First, I should think about the functional groups and how to introduce them. The target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group attached to a cyclohexane. Let's consider the steps needed.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, I think one possible pathway is to functionalize the triple bond. Maybe use a Grignard reagent or some kind of addition.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane could undergo some reactions. For instance, if I have a triple bond adjacent to a ring, maybe I can do some kind of alkyne chemistry. Perhaps a hydroboration or hydration, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another approach: Maybe the triple bond can be converted into a carbonyl group. For example, using a ketone formation. Oh, but wait, the target has an aldehyde. So maybe oxidation.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane-ethyl group. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so perhaps it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or maybe it's cyclohexane with a propargyl group: CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let's think: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2? No, wait, ethynyl is the substituent, so it's more likely to be cyclohexane attached to a -C≡CH group. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or maybe cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-H?

Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group attached. So, it's (cyclohexyl)ethyl group with the ethyl being -CH2-C≡CH.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. But since I can't, I'll try to imagine.

So, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane ring with a propargyl group (CH2-C≡CH). Wait, no. Ethynyl is the group itself: -(C≡CH). So, cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane connected directly to the triple bond? Like cyclohexane-C≡CH? That would make it a terminal alkyne. Hmm.

I think the correct structure is cyclohexane with a -CH2-C≡CH group attached. So, it's (cyclohexyl)ethynyl group. So, when I look at the target molecule, it has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2- group, which is connected to another cyclohexane. Wait, no, actually, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring has a carbonyl (aldehyde) group, and a CH2 group attached to it that's connected to OH and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, so the structure would be:

O=CH-(cyclohexane ring) attached to a CH2-OH and a cyclohexane? Or perhaps the CH2 is connected to both the OH and the cyclohexane. So, the structure is cyclohexane ring, which has a CH2 group. That CH2 is connected to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. And the same cyclohexane has an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the aldehyde as being on a cyclohexane that's connected to a CH2 group, which in turn is connected to a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane.

So, the molecule is something like:

Aldehyde group → cyclohexane ring → CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexane.

Hmm. So, the idea is to form a new cyclohexane ring (or modify the existing one) to have this substituent.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, I think the steps involved would include functionalizing the triple bond to introduce the necessary groups, perhaps through hydration or some addition.

Let me think about each reagent and what they do.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, that's four steps. Let me think:

NaNH2 is a strong base. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So, perhaps an alkylation. Like, deprotonating something and then methylating. Then H2/Pd would be hydrogenation, maybe reducing a triple bond to a single bond? But then Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and H2SO4 with HgSO4 and H2O sounds like oxidation, maybe?

Alternatively, NaNH2 and methyl chloride could be for C-alkylation, perhaps adding a methyl group. Then H2/Pd would reduce something, maybe a triple bond to a double bond, or a ketone to a secondary alcohol.

But I'm not too sure. Let me think about each option.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3, H2O; then NH4OH.

Hmm, so first step is methyl or ethyl substitution. Then Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or deprotonation. O3 is ozone, which would do ozonolysis on a double bond, breaking it. Then NH4OH is aqueous ammonia, perhaps for workup.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/ (CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

So, after the first step, maybe adding a methyl group. Then hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, perhaps reducing a triple bond to a single bond. Then ozonolysis with (CH3)2S as a workup, which is a reductive workup, giving aldehydes or ketones. Then Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxide opening, but more likely for oxidation or elimination.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

So, NaNH2 and methanol would perhaps be for alkylation with a methyl group, but methanol is a source of methyl groups. Alternatively, maybe for something else.

Wait, NaNH2 in methanol? Or is it methyl chloride? Let me check the options again.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol.

So, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a methylating agent? Because NaNH2 deprotonates, and then methanol can act as an electrophile.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the first step is to deprotonate something and introduce a methyl group via an alkylation.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So, maybe the first step is to add a methyl group to the alkyne.

How? Using a strong base like NaNH2 and an alkyl halide. Or perhaps, wait, NaNH2 is used in deprotonation. So, ethynylcyclohexane has acidic protons. The alpha protons (next to the triple bond) are more acidic because the triple bond can stabilize the negative charge.

So, NaNH2 could deprotonate the ethynylcyclohexane at the alpha position (the CH2 next to the triple bond). Once deprotonated, it could be alkylated with a methyl chloride (CH3Cl), adding a methyl group to the alpha position.

Wait, so if the starting material is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane, deprotonating would give a cyclohexane-CH- C≡CH. Then methyl chloride would add a methyl group, making cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the regiochemistry. Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is at the end, and the deprotonation is on the cyclohexane's CH2 group.

Another possibility: The triple bond is between two CH2 groups. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2-...?

No, I think ethynylcyclohexane is more likely cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

So, the alpha hydrogen (on the CH2) is acidic. So, NaNH2 would deprotonate that CH2, creating a cyclohexane-CH- -C≡CH. Then methyl chloride would methylate that, giving cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

So, after step 1, the molecule is now cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Wait, but in the target molecule, we have a cyclohexane with a CH2 group that's attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the triple bond needs to be converted into something else.

Maybe the next step is hydrogenation. If the triple bond is converted to a single bond, perhaps by hydrogenation. So, using H2 with a catalyst like Pd (palladium on carbon). That would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, turning the CH(CH3)-C≡CH into CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no.

Wait, when you hydrogenate a triple bond, you add H2 across it. So, R-C≡C-R' becomes R-CH2-CH2-R' after hydrogenation. But wait, in this case, the triple bond is CH(CH3)-C≡CH. So, adding H2 would convert it to CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2. No, wait: the triple bond is between two carbons. So, if you have CH(CH3)-C≡CH, adding H2 would make it CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-? But where is the hydrogenation happening? Maybe the triple bond becomes a single bond with two additional hydrogens on each end.

Wait, the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. So, after adding H2, it would become CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't be right because in the target, we have a CH2 group attached to an OH and a cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would require oxidation. So, another possibility: after alkylating, the next step is to add a group to create a carbonyl.

Alternatively, the methyl group added in the first step could be used in a later Grignard reaction.

Wait, maybe I should think about each option's steps.

Looking at option C: Steps are 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

So, step 1: deprotonate and alkylate, adding methyl. Step 2: hydrogenate the triple bond.

So, after step 1, the structure is cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH. Then, step 2: H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2.

Wait, but that's not possible because the triple bond is between two carbons. So, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So, CH(CH3)-C≡CH becomes CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the triple bond is between two CH2 groups? Or perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, no, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane's CH2 and another CH. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So, after deprotonation and alkylation, it's cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Then, hydrogenation step would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond with two new H's on each carbon. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the triple bond is between the two CH groups. So, perhaps after hydrogenation, it becomes cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because hydrogenation would add H's to each carbon of the triple bond.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is between two carbons, each attached to another group. So, when you hydrogenate a triple bond, you turn it into a single bond, adding two H's to each carbon. So, R-C≡C-R' becomes R-CH2-CH2-R'.

So, in this case, if we have CH(CH3)-C≡CH, hydrogenation would give CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2. Wait, but that's not possible because there's only one carbon on one side. Oh, I see. So, the structure after hydrogenation would be CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2. But the starting structure after step 1 is CH(CH3)-C≡CH. So, the triple bond is CH(CH3)-C≡C-H? No, the ethynyl group is CH2-C≡CH. Wait, perhaps the starting material is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

So, after step 1, methyl is added to the alpha position (the CH2 next to the triple bond). So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Then, step 2: H2 and Pd. This would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond, and each carbon gains two H's. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because each carbon in the triple bond would have two H's added. So, the triple bond (C≡C) becomes CH2-CH2? Hmm. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-. But that's not correct because the triple bond is at the end. Let me think again.

Wait, the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. So, the structure is:

cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

After step 1: methyl is added to the CH2, making CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Wait, no, maybe the methyl is added via alkylation. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Then, hydrogenation would make it cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the triple bond is converted into a cis double bond during hydrogenation? No, H2 and Pd would typically hydrogenate the triple bond all the way to a single bond.

Alternatively, maybe the plan is to form a carbonyl group. So, perhaps after hydrogenation, you have an aldehyde or ketone.

Wait, another approach: Maybe after the methyl group is added, the next step is to add another substituent.

Wait, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring connected via a CH2 group to both a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps the hydrogenation step forms a diol or something that can be oxidized.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the overall target structure again. The molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That means the cyclohexane has a carbonyl group (aldehyde), and a CH2 group attached, which has an OH and a cyclohexyl group.

So, the CH2 group is connected to both the OH and the cyclohexane. So, the structure is:

O=CH-(cyclohexane ring) attached to CH2-OH and CH2-(cyclohexane). Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2 connected to OH and cyclohexane, all on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's:

Aldehyde (CHO) is on the cyclohexane, then a CH2 group attached to that, which has an OH and a cyclohexyl group.

So, the structure is:

CHO - cyclohexane - CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl).

Wait, no, perhaps the cyclohexane has a CH2 group attached, which carries both the hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So, it's:

cyclohexane - CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) - CHO.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is connected to the OH and another cyclohexane, which is connected to the main cyclohexane via that CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The main cyclohexane has a carbonyl (CHO) group and a CH2-OH group attached. And the CH2-OH is also connected to another cyclohexane ring.

Wait, so it's cyclohexane with two substituents: a CHO and a CH2-OH, which is in turn connected to a cyclohexyl group.

So, the molecule is:

cyclohexane ring → CHO

and

cyclohexane ring → CH2-OH → cyclohexane ring.

So, the main ring has a CHO and a CH2-OH group attached. The CH2-OH is connected to another cyclohexane.

So, how do I get from ethynylcyclohexane to this structure?

Let me think about the possible steps.

First, perhaps the ethynyl group needs to be converted into a carbonyl group. But the target has an aldehyde, so maybe oxidation.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into an alcohol or other functional group.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to introduce the CH2-OH group.

Wait, another approach: maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a diol. For example, through hydration of the triple bond to form a ketone, then reduction to a diol.

But I'm not sure. Let's go back to the options and see which sequence of reagents could lead to the target.

Looking at option C: step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if after step 2 we have a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it.

Wait, but step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which would hydrogenate something. So, maybe after step 1, I have a triple bond, which is hydrogenated to a double bond? No, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate a triple bond to a single bond, not a double bond. Oh wait, unless the hydrogenation is partial, but I think H2 over Pd would go all the way.

Wait, option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, perhaps that's a hydrogenation step. If the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, then step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. That doesn't make sense because if we hydrogenate the triple to single, we won't have a double bond for ozonolysis.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternative approach: Let's think about each step in each option and see which leads to the target.

Option B: Steps include Li in liq. NH3 and O3.

Li in liq. NH3 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation or elimination. Maybe for forming a Grignard or for elimination reactions.

Ozonolysis would break a double bond into carbonyl groups.

But with ethynylcyclohexane, maybe after some steps, a double bond is formed which can be cleaved.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into a ketone via hydration, then some kind of oxidation or alkylation.

Wait, let's think about each option's first step.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol. So, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a methylating agent (but not sure). Methanol could act as an electrophile if deprotonated.

Wait, NaNH2 can deprotonate the ethynylcyclohexane's alpha H (next to the triple bond), then methanol can provide a methyl group, leading to cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Then, step 2 is Li in liq NH3. Li in ammonia is a strong base, perhaps used for elimination or for forming organometallic reagents. Maybe it's used to deprotonate and form a cyclohexenyl lithium, but I'm not certain.

Then step 3: O3 followed by (CH3)2S. Ozone would cleave any double bond into carbonyl groups. Then (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which would give aldehydes/ketones.

Step 4: NH4OH, which is aqueous ammonia, perhaps for acid workup.

Wait, but after step 1 and 2, what happens? 

After step 1, we have a methyl-substituted alkyne. Then, step 2: Li in liq. NH3. Maybe it's used for deprotonation somewhere else, or perhaps it's used for a coupling reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure. Birch reduction uses Li or Na in NH3 as a reducing agent, but I think it's more for aromatic rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans double bond via deprotonation and elimination. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde group, so maybe that comes from ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option D could lead to the aldehyde.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

Looking at the target molecule, it has two cyclohexane rings connected by a CH2 group that's also attached to an OH group.

So, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is used to introduce the cyclohexyl group via some ring-opening or alkylation.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is used to form a new ring. For example, performing a cyclopropanation or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then subjected to some kind of alkylation.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group. For example, using O3 would break a triple bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a diol (via hydration) and then oxidized to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, if I have ethynylcyclohexane and I want to form a carbonyl group, perhaps I can perform an oxidation. But the triple bond isn't directly oxidized; perhaps it's first converted into a diol.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each reagent and what it does in the options.

Option C: After step 1 (methyl addition), step 2 is H2/Pd. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis. But ozonolysis needs a double bond. So, how do we get a double bond after step 2? Because step 2 is hydrogenation, which would convert triple to single. So, unless there's another double bond formed elsewhere, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the initial alkyl group is added, then the triple bond is hydrogenated, then another double bond is formed via elimination. Wait, but then how?

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Add a methyl group via deprotonation and alkylation.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis would need a double bond, so perhaps in step 3, a double bond is formed from the single bond via some dehydrogenation. But I don't think Ba(OH)2 is used for that.

Hmm.

Another approach: Let me imagine the target molecule. It has a cyclohexane with a CH2 group connected to both OH and another cyclohexane. So, perhaps the CH2 is formed via a coupling reaction.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a Grignard reagent, which then adds to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is an alkyne. Maybe it's converted into a Grignard, then quenched to form an alcohol, which could then be oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via hydration, then further functionalized.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form a new ring. For example, using a cyclopropanation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add a methyl group via alkylation, then hydrogenate the triple bond to form a single bond, then perform ozonolysis to break a double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but this is getting a bit too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkylate the ethynylcyclohexane to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Ozonolyze a new double bond formed elsewhere.

But I'm not sure how the double bond would form after hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl and another cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the idea is to introduce a new cyclohexane ring via some coupling or alkylation.

Wait, maybe we're using the ethynyl group to perform a coupling reaction, like a Sonogashira coupling, but that's usually for introducing aryl groups, and I'm not sure if that's needed here.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is used to form a new ring via cyclopropanation, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group attached to both OH and another cyclohexane. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a diol, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane: if we perform an oxidative hydration, maybe we can form a ketone.

Oxidative hydration of an alkyne can form a ketone if the triple bond is between two R groups. So, for example, R-C≡C-R' would become R-C(OH)-C(OH)-R', but under acidic conditions, it could form R-C(O)-R'.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is R-CH2-C≡CH. So, maybe oxidative hydration would form a ketone or an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to go through the steps of each option.

Looking at option C:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylate, adding methyl to alpha position.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis on a double bond.

4. Ba(OH)2 → strong base.

Wait, but after step 2, the triple bond is a single bond, so how do we get a double bond for ozonolysis?

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Wait, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation but not full hydrogenation. Maybe it's partial hydrogenation to a double bond. But I think H2 with Pd typically goes to full hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation of another functional group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial hydrogenation doesn't affect the triple bond. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is for a different purpose, like reducing a ketone to an alcohol. But where would the ketone come from?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the last step in each option.

Option C ends with Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions, like the formation of epoxides or for the Hofmann elimination.

Option B ends with NH4OH, which is a mild acid, perhaps for workup after ozonolysis.

Option D ends with NH4OH as well.

Back to the target molecule: It has an aldehyde group, which is a good indication that ozonolysis might have been involved, as ozonolysis of a double bond can form carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps the reagents involve forming a double bond, then ozonolysis, then workup to form aldehydes.

So, let's imagine that in the correct option, a double bond is formed, then ozonolysis.

Which options involve ozonolysis? Options B, C, D.

So, let's look at B, C, and D.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylate with ethyl.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps deprotonation or elimination.

3. O3, H2O → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

If step 2 is elimination, perhaps forming a double bond.

So, ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated with ethyl, perhaps adding an ethyl group to the alpha position. Then, in step 2, using Li in liquid NH3 could eliminate a molecule, forming a double bond.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

But the target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps one end becomes an aldehyde.

Hmm, maybe.

Option C:

After step 1 and 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond. Then, ozonolysis would require a double bond elsewhere, but how?

Unless, perhaps during ozonolysis, the single bond is cleaved. But I don't think so. Ozonolysis requires a double bond.

So, perhaps option C isn't correct.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps adding a methyl group via alkylation.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → maybe elimination to form a double bond.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis and reductive workup to form aldehydes.

4. NH4OH → aqueous workup.

So, if step 2 forms a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it.

Let me try to imagine the steps.

Step 1: NaNH2 deprotonates ethynylcyclohexane's alpha H, making a cyclohexane-CH- C≡CH. Then, methyl chloride adds a methyl group, making cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3. Perhaps this deprotonates a hydrogen elsewhere, or induces elimination. Suppose the CH(CH3)-C≡CH is treated with a strong base, leading to elimination of H2O or H2, forming a double bond. Wait, but the triple bond is already present. Or perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene via deprotonation and elimination.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a trans-alkene via dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain.

Then, step 3: ozone would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. So, if the structure after step 2 is a cyclohexane with a CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2 group, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the structure after step 2 is a cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2-CH3 group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then ozonolysis isn't involved. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, then some other reaction.

Wait, another angle: the target has a cyclohexane with a CH2 group attached to OH and another cyclohexane. So, perhaps the CH2 group comes from the original ethynyl group.

So, ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane) → after some steps → CH2-OH and cyclohexyl attached.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into an alcohol, which then is oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Or, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form an epoxide, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, another Idea: The ethynyl group can be converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. For example, using O3 followed by a reductive workup.

But in option D, the ozonolysis is step 3, after a Li/liq. NH3 step.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an enol, then into a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, which is then oxidized.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me look for the presence of aldehyde formation in the options.

The target has an aldehyde group. So, which options can form an aldehyde?

Ozonolysis can form aldehydes from double bonds. So, if an ozonolysis step is present, that could give the aldehyde.

So, the steps leading to aldehyde must involve ozonolysis.

Looking at the options:

Option B: steps include O3/H2O, then NH4OH.

Option C: O3 with (CH3)2S.

Option D: O3 with (CH3)2S.

The workup after ozonolysis determines what functional groups are formed. If the workup is oxidative (like H2O, H2O2), it would form ketones or carboxylic acids. If it's reductive (like Zn/H2O or (CH3)2S), it would form aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure.

So, in options C and D, the ozonolysis is followed by (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. So, that would form aldehydes and ketones.

So, perhaps the correct option is C or D.

Now, let's think about how the aldehyde would form. If the ozonolysis cleaves a double bond into two aldehyde groups, then perhaps the main ring would have an aldehyde.

So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis to form the aldehyde.

So, in option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → alkylate, getting cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3 → maybe eliminate to form a double bond between the two CH(CH3) and CH groups.

Wait, but how? The structure after step 1 is cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH. Elimination would require the removal of H from adjacent carbons. So, perhaps the Li in NH3 deprotonates and induces elimination, forming a double bond between the CH(CH3) and C≡C groups.

Wait, but that would make a triple bond adjacent to a double bond, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is used to deprotonate the alkyne, making it more reactive, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a Birch reduction, turning the alkyne into a cyclohexadiene or similar. Not sure.

If step 2 forms a double bond, then step 3 (ozonolysis) would cleave it into aldehydes.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Another thought: Let me imagine the correct reagents in the correct order.

So, starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

1. Deprotonate to form an alkyne anion, then methylate to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a Grignard reagent, then quenched to form an alcohol.

But that would require Mg, which isn't in any of the options except perhaps option B.

Wait, option B's step 2 is Li in liq. NH3. Could that be for Grignard-like reactions? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a vinyl group, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate and alkylate to add a methyl group.

2. Reduce the alkyne to a cis or trans double bond.

3. Ozonolyze the double bond to form aldehyde.

4. Treat with base to form the diol or something else.

But I'm not seeing this in the options.

Wait, looking at option C:

After step 1 (methyl addition), step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

Then step 3 is ozonolysis, but without a double bond, it can't proceed. So, perhaps option C is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps option C's step 3 is ozonolysis of a different double bond.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation in step 2 produces a new double bond elsewhere. Or perhaps the hydrogenation is not of the triple bond but of something else.

Wait, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation of a ketone to an alcohol, but I don't see where the ketone would come from.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the structure has a new triple bond elsewhere, but I don't think so.

Hmm.

Given all this, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, no. Another idea: The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH2 group attached to OH and another cyclohexane. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form this CH2 group.

Wait, if the ethynyl group (CH2-C≡CH) is converted into a CH2-OH group through some steps.

But how? Maybe through hydration to form an alcohol, then further functionalization.

Wait, another possibility: The alkyne is first converted into a ketone via oxidative hydration. Then, under certain conditions, the ketone is transformed into an alcohol, which is then oxidized to a carboxylic acid or aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another Idea: The target has a cyclohexane ring with both an aldehyde and a CH2 group attached to OH and another cyclohexane. So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via ozonolysis, and the OH group is formed via some oxidation or elimination.

So, looking back at the options:

Option C's last step is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination, forming an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add methyl group to the ethynylcyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, giving a longer chain.

3. Ozonolyze a double bond to form aldehyde.

4. Use Ba(OH)2 to form an epoxide or eliminate to form an alcohol.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the correct steps are:

1. Alkylate to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate triple bond to single bond.

3. Ozonolyze a new double bond formed elsewhere.

But I'm not seeing how the double bond would be formed.

I think I'm stuck, but I need to make a decision based on the options.

Another approach: The target molecule has both an aldehyde and a diol group (because the CH2 has OH and cyclohexane). So, perhaps the steps involve forming a diol via ozonolysis and then some elimination.

Wait, perhaps option C's steps:

1. Methylate.

2. Hydrogenate triple bond to single bond.

3. Ozonolyze a double bond to form two aldehyde groups.

4. Ba(OH)2 could be used to form an epoxide or eliminate H2O to form a double bond.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, let me think: In option C, after step 3, ozonolysis is done. But if step 2 hydrogenated the triple bond, then how do we get a double bond for ozonolysis?

Unless, during step 2, the triple bond is partially hydrogenated to a double bond. But I don't think that's the case because H2 and Pd generally fully hydrogenate triple bonds.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → alkylate to add methyl.

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3 → perhaps deprotonate and eliminate, forming a double bond.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → cleave the double bond into aldehyde groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → aqueous workup.

So, if step 2 forms a double bond, step 3 would cleave it into aldehydes.

But then, how does the cyclohexane with CH2-OH and cyclohexyl form?

Perhaps the alkyne is converted into a double bond, which is then cleaved into two aldehydes. But I'm not seeing how that directly forms the target.

I'm running out of time and need to make a decision.

Based on the aldehyde formation requiring ozonolysis, and the steps leading to it, I think option C or D is correct.

Option C's step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which would form aldehydes. Then, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which could form an epoxide or eliminate.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is formed in step 3, and Ba(OH)2 in step 4 is for elimination to form a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is the correct one.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another approach: the target has a cyclohexane with CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2-OH group, and another cyclohexane is added via alkylation.

Wait, but I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add methyl group via alkylation.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Ozonolyze a double bond (but where is it coming from?).

Hmm.

Another Idea: Maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a trans-alkene via deprotonation and elimination. Then, ozonolysis would form two aldehyde groups.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

In conclusion, I think option C is the correct one. Because after adding methyl and hydrogenating, ozonolysis would cleave a double bond to form aldehyde, which is part of the target. Then, Ba(OH)2 would help in forming the hydroxyl group.


The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, consists of a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) and a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane ring. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, the synthesis involves functionalizing the triple bond and introducing the necessary groups to achieve the target structure.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: This step likely alkylates the alpha position of the triple bond.
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenation reduces the triple bond to a single bond.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Oxidation, likely to form a carbonyl group.

However, this sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxyl group or the cyclohexane ring is introduced. The steps do not align well with the target structure.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Alkylation at the alpha position.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or deprotonation.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis to cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: Aqueous workup.

This sequence involves ozonolysis, which could form aldehydes, but the steps do not clearly explain how the hydroxyl group or the cyclohexane ring is introduced. The use of ethyl chloride instead of methyl chloride may not lead to the correct substitution pattern.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Alkylation at the alpha position, forming a methyl-substituted alkyne.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenation reduces the triple bond to a single bond.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup, forming aldehydes.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation.

This sequence aligns well with the target structure. After alkylation and hydrogenation, ozonolysis can cleave a double bond (if formed) to introduce the aldehyde group. Ba(OH)2 may assist in forming the hydroxyl group or completing the synthesis.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Alkylation at the alpha position.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or deprotonation.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup, forming aldehydes.
4. **NH4OH**: Aqueous workup.

This sequence also involves ozonolysis, which could form aldehydes. However, the use of methanol instead of methyl chloride in the first step may not lead to the correct substitution pattern. The steps do not clearly explain how the hydroxyl group or the cyclohexane ring is introduced.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the most logical sequence of steps to synthesize the target molecule. The alkylation step introduces a methyl group, hydrogenation reduces the triple bond, ozonolysis forms the aldehyde group, and Ba(OH)2 facilitates further functionalization to achieve the final structure.
