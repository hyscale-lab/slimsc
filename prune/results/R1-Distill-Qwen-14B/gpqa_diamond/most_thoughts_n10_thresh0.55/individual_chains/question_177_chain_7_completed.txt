Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. 

The problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. The question is about the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity (L) of a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature. So, L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But wait, the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T_1 = T_2, since λ_1 = λ_2.

Wait, but wait a second. The stars have different masses and radii. Does that affect their temperatures? Well, in main sequence stars, more massive stars are hotter, but this is a black body assumption. But the problem says the peak wavelengths are the same, which implies same T. So T1 = T2. So the temperature is the same for both stars.

So, now, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴). Since T1 = T2, that ratio simplifies to (R1²)/(R2²). Given R1 is 1.5 R2, so R ratio is 1.5. Squared is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor would be about 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Does that affect the calculation? Hmm, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. In spectroscopy, the observed wavelength is shifted due to Doppler effect. The star moving towards us blueshifts, away redshifts.

But wait, in this problem, the peak wavelengths are the same. So if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, wouldn't that shift its emitted wavelengths? So the observed λ_max for Star_2 would be different, but the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So perhaps we need to account for the Doppler shift.

Oh! That's a point I missed. Because if Star_2 is moving, its emitted wavelengths are Doppler shifted, which would affect the observed λ_max. So, the actual peak emission of Star_2 might be different, but due to its velocity, we observe the same λ_max as Star_1.

Wait, Wien's law is about the star's actual emission. So when we observe the star, the Doppler effect would shift all wavelengths by a factor. So the observed λ_max observed would be λ_emitted multiplied by the Doppler factor.

So let me think. The Doppler shift formula is approximately: observed wavelength λ' = λ * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, if the star is moving towards us, v_r would be negative, so λ' would be less than λ. If moving away, v_r is positive, λ' larger.

Wait, but in this problem, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ1_observed = λ1_emitted. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Are they moving towards or away? The problem doesn't specify, but the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so positive velocity. So for Star_2, λ2_observed = λ2_emit * (1 + v2_r / c).

The problem states that λ1_observed = λ2_observed. Since λ1_emit is from Star_1, which is at rest. So λ1_emit = λ1_observed. So:

λ1 = λ2_emit * (1 + v2_r / c)

But from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ1 = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2.

So substituting λ2_emit into the equation:

λ1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2_r / c)

But λ1 = b / T1, so:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2_r / c)

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2_r / c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2_r / c)

Wait, but wait. If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So λ_observed = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). So if Star_2 is moving away, the observed λ would be longer. But in the problem, both observed λ are same, so λ2_emit would be shorter than λ1_emit if Star_2 is moving away. Because λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v/c) = λ1.

So λ2_emit = λ1 / (1 + v/c) = (b / T1) / (1 + v/c)

But according to Wien's law, λ2_emit = b / T2. So:

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + v / c)

Cancel b:

1 / T2 = 1/(T1 (1 + v/c))

So T2 = T1 (1 + v/c)

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the star is moving away, the emitted wavelength is shorter, so the star would appear hotter. Wait, but according to this equation, if v is positive (moving away), then T2 is larger than T1? Because (1 + v/c) is bigger than 1, so T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) would make T2 larger. But that would mean Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. But previously, I thought T1 = T2 because λ1_obs and λ2_obs are the same, but perhaps I was wrong. I need to correct that.

So, let's reevaluate. The observed λ_max for both stars is the same. Let's denote λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2 = λ.

Star_1 is at rest, so its emitted λ_max is λ_obs_1 = λ.

Star_2 is moving, so its emitted λ_max is λ_emit_2, and observed λ_obs_2 = λ_emit_2 * (1 + v_2 / c) = λ.

So λ_emit_2 = λ / (1 + v_2 / c)

But according to Wien's law, λ_emit_1 = b / T1, and λ_emit_2 = b / T2.

So,

λ_emit_2 = λ_emit_1 * (T1 / T2)

But λ_emit_2 = λ / (1 + v_2/c) = λ_emit_1 * (T1 / T2)

So,

λ / (1 + v_2/c) = (b / T1) * (T1 / T2) )

Wait, b is a constant, so it cancels.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let me write the two Wien's law equations for each star.

For Star_1:
λ1_obs = λ1_emit = b / T1

For Star_2:
λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c) = b / T2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ

But Star_1's λ1_obs is also λ, because λ1_obs = λ1_emit.

So,

λ = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c )

But also,

λ = b / T1

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2 T1:

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

Wait, that can't be correct because if Star_2 is moving away, v is positive, so T2 becomes larger than T1. But then, Star_2 would be hotter, which would affect the luminosity calculation.

So, now, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

But T2 is T1*(1 + v2/c). So T2^4 = T1^4 * (1 + v2/c)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = [ (R1^2 T1^4 ) ] / [ R2^2 T2^4 ]

= (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4)/( (T1 * (1 + v2/c) )^4 )

= (2.25) * (1/(1 + v2/c)^4 )

Now, what's v2? The radial velocity is 700 km/s. Let's compute v2/c.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 700 /300000 = 0.002333...

So approximately 0.00233. So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.00233.

So (1 + v2/c)^4 ≈ (1.00233)^4. Let me compute that.

Approximating, since 0.00233 is small, (1+x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2) x².

So x = 0.00233, n=4.

(1.00233)^4 ≈ 1 +4*(0.00233) +6*(0.00233)^2 + 4*(0.00233)^3 + (0.00233)^4.

Compute each term:

4*0.00233 = 0.00932

6*(0.00233)^2 =6*(0.0000054289) ≈ 0.000032573.

4*(0.00233)^3 ≈4*(0.00000001255) ≈ 5.02e-8.

(0.00233)^4 is about 2.97e-11.

Adding these up:

1 + 0.00932 =1.00932

1.00932 +0.000032573 =1.009352573

Plus the other terms are negligible. So approximately 1.00935.

So (1.00233)^4 ≈1.00935.

So putting it back into L1/L2:

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * (1 / 1.00935 ) ≈ 2.25 / 1.00935 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 1.00935.

Well, 2.25 / ~1.01 is about 2.2277.

But let me compute it more accurately.

1.00935 is approximately 1.00935.

Divide 2.25 by 1.00935.

Let me do this division.

1.00935 * 2.227 = ?

Let me compute 2.227 * 1.00935.

2.227 * 1 = 2.227
2.227 * 0.00935 = approx 0.02084
Total: 2.227 + 0.02084 = 2.24784.

So 2.227 * 1.00935 ≈ 2.24784. But we're trying to get 2.25.

So perhaps 2.227 is close to the correct value.

So the ratio is approximately 2.227, which is about 2.23.

Looking at the options:

Options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

So the closest is D) ~2.23.

Wait a minute, but wait. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of the temperature ratio?

Because in the luminosity formula, it's (T1 / T2)^4. No, wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

So that's ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Which is (2.25) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

But from earlier, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)

So (T1 / T2)^4 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)^4

Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1 + v2/c)^4 ].

So that's what I had earlier.

Thus, with 1.00935 as (1 + v/c)^4, we have 2.25 / 1.00935 ≈2.227, which is 2.23.

So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but why did I think earlier that the temperatures would be the same? Because I didn't consider the Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength. So the initial approach was wrong when I thought T1 = T2, because the Doppler shift changes the observed λ, which affects the perceived temperature. Therefore, T2 is higher than T1 because Star_2 is moving away, making its observed λ longer, which would imply a lower temperature if not considering the shift. But with the shift, the actual temperature of Star_2 is higher.

So, with the Doppler shift considered, the luminosity ratio is about 2.23, option D.

So, the answer is D.


To determine the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2, we use the black body luminosity formula:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \implies \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
\]

### Step 1: Temperature Relationship
The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) of both stars are the same. Using Wien's Law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + \frac{v_r}{c}),
\]

where \(v_r\) is the radial velocity and \(c\) is the speed of light. For Star_1 (\(v_r = 0\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \frac{b}{T_1}.
\]

For Star_2 (\(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + \frac{v_r}{c}).
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot (1 + \frac{v_r}{c}).
\]

Canceling \(b\) and rearranging:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + \frac{v_r}{c}).
\]

### Step 2: Radial Velocity Correction
The radial velocity of Star_2 is \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), and \(c \approx 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.00233.
\]

\[
1 + \frac{v_r}{c} \approx 1.00233.
\]

Squaring and raising to the fourth power (for the temperature term in luminosity):

\[
(1 + \frac{v_r}{c})^4 \approx (1.00233)^4 \approx 1.00935.
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
The radii are given as \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\), so:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.
\]

Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4}.
\]

Since \(T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + \frac{v_r}{c})\), we have:

\[
\frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{v_r}{c})^4} \approx \frac{1}{1.00935}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{1.00935} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.991 \approx 2.23.
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2.
