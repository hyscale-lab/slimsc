Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor's radius is R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The cavity is not at the center; it's shifted by distance s from the center of the conductor. So the centers are s apart. Now, we place a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

Wait, point P is outside, so its distance from the conductor's center is L, which is greater than R. And the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l is greater than R, so P is outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta. 

I remember that when there's a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But since the conductor was initially uncharged, the presence of +q in the cavity would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, how exactly does that work? I think the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) would have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it because the conductor was neutral overall. 

But wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q, and the inner cavity has -q. But wait, the conductor was uncharged, and we added +q inside the cavity. So the conductor's total charge remains zero. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q? No, wait. Because the conductor as a whole was neutral, when we add +q in the cavity, the conductor's charges adjust. The inner surface of the conductor (cavity's wall) must have a charge of -q because the charge +q inside induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q because the inner surface has -q, so the conductor's net charge is -q (inner) + outer. Wait, but the conductor was initially neutral, so total charge is zero. Therefore, the outer surface must have +q so that the total is (-q) + (+q) = 0. 

Wait, that makes sense. So the outer surface has +q. But how does this affect the electric field outside the conductor? I remember that the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within
