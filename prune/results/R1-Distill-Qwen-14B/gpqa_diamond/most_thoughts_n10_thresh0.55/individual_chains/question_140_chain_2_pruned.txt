Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 3 degrees above room temperature, so maybe B is a solid at room temperature? Wait, 277 K is 4Â°C, so B's melting point is just above freezing. Hmm.

Then there's another clue: the product of the reaction between a certain keto acid and substance X has two oxygen atoms. Also, substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is mentioned, which makes me think of something common like LiAlH4 or another strong reducing agent.

Let me think about the reaction. Substance X is reacting violently with a liquid Y. What liquids react violently? Maybe something like water? Or perhaps an acid. Wait, if X is a metal, maybe Y is an acid. But I'm not sure yet.

The gas W's molecule has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. Water is H2O, but that's a liquid. Hydrogen gas (H2) has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, doesn't fit. Oxygen gas (O2) has 8 protons each, but 8 neutrons would mean O-16, but O2 has two atoms so 16 each? Wait, maybe W is CO2? No, wait, let me calculate.

Wait, the molecule should have same number of neutrons and protons in total. Let's see: possible molecules. For example, H2O: each H has 1 proton, O has 8. So each molecule has 2 H (2 protons) and O (8). So total protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons in H: 0 each, O: 8. So total neutrons: 0 +8=8. Oh, but 10 protons vs 8 neutrons isn't equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, what about CH4? No, maybe something else. What about CO? Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen 8. So CO has (6 +8) protons = 14. Neutrons
