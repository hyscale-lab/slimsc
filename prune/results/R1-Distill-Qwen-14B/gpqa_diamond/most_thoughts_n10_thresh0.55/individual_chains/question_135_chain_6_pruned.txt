Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, so the boson X is interacting with fermions. I remember that in particle physics, the Lagrangian terms determine the possible interactions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I need to find out which fermions it can decay into, considering their masses.

Wait, the decay of a boson into fermions depends on whether the fermion mass is less than half the boson's mass. Because for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the combined rest mass of the pair must be less than the boson's mass. So each fermion's mass must be less than M_X / 2.

So M_X is 6 GeV. Half of that is 3 GeV. So any fermion with a mass less than 3 GeV can be produced.

Let me list out the known fermion masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV (much less than 3 GeV)
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV (way less)
- Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV (still way under)
- Charm quark (c): about 1.5 GeV (since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV)
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV (wait, that's over 3 GeV)
- Top quark (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV (so way too big)
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Neutrinos are even lighter, but I don't see any in the options.

So for fermions, the available ones are those with mass less than 3 GeV. Let's see:

Charm quark (c): 1.5 GeV <3 GeV → allowed
Bottom quark (b): 4.5 GeV → nope, too heavy
Tau lepton (τ): mass ~1.777 GeV → allowed
Electron (e): allowed
Muon (μ): 0.105 GeV → allowed

What about the others? Like the up, down, strange quarks, but the options don't include them. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: bb, ss, uu, dd, τ+τ-, ee. But wait, b quarks are heavy, so that's not allowed. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: cc, ss, uu, dd, τ, μ, e. So c is okay, τ is okay, mu is okay. So B includes these.

Option C: cc, ss, uu, dd, tt, τ, μ, e. But top quark is way too heavy, so C is out.

Option D
