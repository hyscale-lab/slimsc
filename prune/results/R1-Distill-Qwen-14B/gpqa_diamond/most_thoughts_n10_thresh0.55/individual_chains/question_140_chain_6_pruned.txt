Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slowly.

So the question is about a chemical reaction involving Substance X, liquid Y, and the products. The description is a bit detailed, so I need to parse each part carefully.

First, the problem mentions that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an element with a heavier isotope, which suggests that maybe X is a compound containing an element that has significant isotopes, like chlorine (which has Cl-35 and Cl-37) or something like that.

The reaction is violent, which makes me think of something reactive. Maybe a metal reacting with an acid, or perhaps a halogen reacting with something. The reaction releases gas W. The key here is that the molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for a molecule, each atom contributes to this. Let's think: common gases like H2, O2, N2, CO2, etc. Wait, if W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, that's per atom or per molecule?

Wait, the question says "molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So each molecule has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. Hmm. Let's think about possible gases. Let's see:

- H2: Each H has 0 neutrons (protium), so each H has 1 proton. So each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal.
- O2: Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's O-16). So each molecule has 16 protons (8*2) and 16 neutrons (8*2). So 16 and 16, which are equal. So O2 could be W.
- CO2: Each CO2 molecule has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons in C-12) and two O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Oh wait, that also works. So CO2 is a possibility.
Wait, but wait: CO2 is a gas, yes. So W could be either O2 or CO2, but the reaction needs to produce what?

The precipitate G forms when X and Y react. When G is heated, it releases B
