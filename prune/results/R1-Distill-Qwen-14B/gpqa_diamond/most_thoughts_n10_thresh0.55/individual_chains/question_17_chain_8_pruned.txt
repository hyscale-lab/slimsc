Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent that forms complexes with metal ions. So Ca-EDTA would be a complex ion, right? I remember that when a complex is formed, the metal ions are surrounded by ligands, which in this case is EDTA.

The given K value is 5x10^10. Wait, K for the complex is the formation constant, Kf. So Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

The problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. Since the complex is formed, the free calcium ions would be very low because most of the Ca is tied up in the complex.

Wait, so the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the complex as CaEDTA^2- for simplicity. So initial concentration [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, let's let the concentration of free Ca^2+ be 'x'. Then, since each mole of CaEDTA^2- dissociates into one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA would also be 'x' from the dissociation. Wait, but wait, that's assuming that all the complex dissociates, which isn't the case. Because Kf is very large, the dissociation is minimal, so x would be very small compared to 0.02. So I can probably approximate [CaEDTA^2-] as approximately 0.02 M, since x is tiny.

So the formation constant equation is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). 

Wait, but in this solution, the EDTA is part of the complex. So when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. So the concentration of EDTA^4- would be equal to the concentration of Ca^2+, since each complex gives one of each. So [EDTA^4-] = x, and [Ca^2+] = x.

So substituting into the equation, K
