Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and from that, we can calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state.

Wait, but wait. The energy uncertainty for each state is related to its lifetime. The formula I remember is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt), where Δt is the lifetime of the state. Because the lifetime is the time during which the system is in that state before it decays or changes. So, longer lifetime means lower energy uncertainty.

Wait, no, actually, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / (Δt). Because, for example, in quantum mechanics, a state with a longer lifetime (larger Δt) has a smaller energy uncertainty because it's more precisely defined in time. So, the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (Δt). So, the shorter the lifetime, the larger the energy uncertainty.
