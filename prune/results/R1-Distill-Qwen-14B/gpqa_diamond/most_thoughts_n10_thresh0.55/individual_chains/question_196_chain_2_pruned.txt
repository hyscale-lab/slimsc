Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass attached to a spring oscillates. But wait, this is relativistic, so I can't use the classical equations of motion. Oh right, because when speeds get close to the speed of light, special relativity comes into play and the classical formulas break down.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think about what I know about relativistic oscillators.

In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal, I get v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is the relativistic case, so I can't just use that.

Oh right, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to set the total mechanical energy equal to the sum of potential and relativistic kinetic energy.

The total mechanical energy of a harmonic oscillator in the classical case is (1/2)kA², which is the maximum potential energy when the mass is at the amplitude A. But when considering relativity, does the total energy change? I think the total energy would still be the same, but kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, but when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), all the energy is potential, so the kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. But in relativistic terms, the kinetic energy is more involved.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the energy is conserved, but the expressions are different. So the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let's think again.

In the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. Potential is (1/2)kx², and kinetic is (γ - 1)mc². At maximum displacement, x = A, so kinetic is zero, and E = (1/2)kA² + mc². Wait, no, because (γ-1)mc² is the kinetic energy. At x=A, the kinetic is zero so E = mc² + potential, which is (1/2)kA² + mc²? Or wait, no, when x=A, the potential is (1/2)kA², and kinetic is zero, so total energy E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, perhaps the total energy is higher because we have the rest mass energy plus the potential energy. Hmm, but that might not be correct. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy in the relativistic case is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So the total energy is E = kinetic energy + potential energy. At maximum displacement, potential is (1/2)kA², kinetic is zero, so E = (1/2)kA² + mc²? Wait, no, because the rest energy is mc², and the kinetic energy adds to that. So in the maximum displacement, the total energy is E = (1/2)kA² + mc². Then, when the mass is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So we set that equal to (γ - 1)mc² = E - mc² = (1/2)kA².

So (γ - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA². Solving for γ: γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²). So γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²
