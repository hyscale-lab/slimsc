Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a bit because the planet orbits it, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the only differences are the Doppler shifts observed.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is, how much longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1?

Wait, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula for the RV method is something like (v) is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity.

Oh right! The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * (sin i)

But since the planets have similar masses to Neptune and stars are solar mass, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, K simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * (sin i)

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But again, since M_p is much smaller, it's (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) multiplied by (2π G/(P c))^(1/3).

Wait, perhaps I can relate the velocities K1 and K2 with the orbital periods P1 and P2.

The question gives the wavelength shifts, which correspond to velocities. The Doppler shift is given by delta lambda over lambda is approximately v/c, but for small velocities, delta lambda (in angstroms) can be related to velocity (v in km/s) via:

delta lambda (angstroms) ≈ (v * c) / (lambda_0 * 1e5)

Wait, let me think. The formula I recall is:

v = (delta_lambda / lambda_0) * c

But delta_lambda is in the same units as lambda_0. For example, if lambda_0 is in angstroms and delta_lambda is also in angstroms, then v (in km/s) would be:

v = (delta_lambda (A) / lambda_0 (A)) * c (km/s per A)

Wait, wait. Let me get the units right. c is about 3e5 km/s. So, if delta_lambda is in angstroms, and lambda_0 is in angstroms, then v (km/s) = (delta_lambda /
