Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm. Let's see what the question says.

So, the operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix whose first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). Wait, I think S looks like the Pauli Y matrix. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and the Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh right, that's exactly what S is. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

The problem is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. And we have to choose which statement is correct among the four options.

First, let's recall some quantum mechanics. The intrinsic angular momentum operators, like Sx, Sy, Sz, are related to the Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues of these operators are ± ħ/2 multiplied by some factor, depending on the system. But wait, wait. For an electron, the spin is 1/2, so the eigenvalues of S (like Sy) would be ± ħ/2. But here, the operator is c multiplied by S. So let's compute c first.

c is h/(4π). But h is Planck's constant, which is 2π times ħ. So h = 2πħ. So c = (2πħ)/(4π) ) = ħ/(2). So c is ħ/2. So Ay = c * S = (ħ/2) * S_y, where S_y is the Pauli Y matrix.

Wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, right? Because if you diagonalize them, their eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So for S, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So then Ay should have eigenvalues c * eigenvalues of S. So eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2) * (+1) and (ħ/2) * (-1). So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, no, wait. Because S is the Pauli matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1. So Ay = (ħ/2) S. So the eigenvalues of Ay are (ħ/
