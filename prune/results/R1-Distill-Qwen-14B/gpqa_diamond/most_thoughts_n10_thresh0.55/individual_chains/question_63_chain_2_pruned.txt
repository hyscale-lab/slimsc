Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, the question is asking about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the molecule is made up of atoms X and Y. The masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are all about the momentum p of the photon.

Wait, so the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. But when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state. Oh, but wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that's the first excited state.

I'm a bit confused about whether this is a rotation, vibration, or both. Because the problem mentions the rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor model probably includes both vibrations and rotations, so maybe the molecule's energy states are a combination of both.

Wait, but the fundamental state would have the lowest energy. Then when it absorbs a photon, it can either go to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the question is about the least possible energy increase. So which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the transition.

Hmm, the energy levels for vibration are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number. And for rotation, E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number. But in the rotation-vibration model, I think the energy levels are a combination of both, but perhaps the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) with the lowest rotational state (J=0 or 1, depending on the molecule), maybe.

Wait, the fundamental state is when both are at their lowest. So if the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state, absorbing a photon could cause a transition to either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), whichever requires lower energy.

Alternatively, maybe the next state is a combination where both change, but I think the lowest energy transition is the one with the smallest energy difference. So I need to find the energy gap between the fundamental state and the next possible state, whether it's vibrational or rotational.

So I should calculate the energy difference for both possible transitions and see which one is smaller. The photon's energy must match the smaller of the two, so that's the transition that will occur.

First, let's compute the vibrational energy difference. The energy levels for vibration are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. The fundamental state is v=0, so the next vibrational state is v=1. The energy difference ΔE_vib is E_vib(1) - E_vib(0) = h w (1 + 1/2 - 0 - 1/2) )= h w (1) = h w.

So ΔE_vib = h w.

Then, for rotational energy. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J +1 ), where B is h/(8 π² I c), or wait, maybe B is another term. Hmm, I think B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J + 1), and B is h²/(8 π² I c), but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I by B = ħ²/(2 I), where ħ is h/(2π). Wait, let me get that right. The moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. So I need to compute μ first.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let me compute that. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but I need to convert amu to kg because standard units are in kg.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me calculate that. 20/11 is about 1.818, so 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

Then, I = μ R². R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational constant B is (h²)/(8 π² I), right? Because E_rot = (ħ²/(2 I)) J (J +1), but sometimes it's written as B = ħ²/(2 I). Wait, I think I might be mixing up the formulas. Let me double-check.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2 I)) J (J +1). So the rotational constant B is ħ²/(2 I). So B = ( (h/(2π))² ) / (2 I ) ) = h²/(8 π² I). Yes, that's correct.

So B = h²/(8 π² I).

Let me compute h. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

So B = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 π² * 1.207e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 * ( π² ) * 1.207e-46 ≈ 8 * 9.8696 * 1.207e-46 ≈ 8 * 11.924e-46 ≈ 9.539e-45.

So B ≈ 4.39e-67 / 9.539e-45 ≈ 4.599e-23 J.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, denominator: 8 π² I = 8 * (3.1416)^2 * 1.207e-46.

Compute 3.1416 squared: approx 9.8696.

So 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.
