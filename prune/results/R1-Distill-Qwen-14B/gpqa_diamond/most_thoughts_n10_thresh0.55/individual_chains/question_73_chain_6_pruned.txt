Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to remember what I know.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics, right? Because when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait--wait, no, actually, I think the formula is (v1 + v2)/(1 + (v1*v2)/(c²)) when adding velocities, but since these are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)), because one is moving at v1 and the other at v2, so from the perspective of the first astronaut (v1), the second is moving at v2. So the relative speed would be how much faster v1 is than v2 from one's perspective.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. If both are moving in the same direction, say, along the x-axis, then the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen by the first is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/(c²)) ), but wait, that's if you're calculating the speed of the second as seen from the first's frame. Wait, maybe I'm getting the signs wrong. Let me think: if I'm in frame S, where object A is moving at v1, and object B is moving at v2, then the speed of B as seen from A's frame (which is moving at v1 relative to S) would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/(c²)) ). Oh, right, because when you switch frames, you apply the velocity transformation.

So in this problem, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction. So, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.
