Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize its structure.

So, I think the target has a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a formyl (CHO) group. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it mentally. The main chain might be a cyclohexane with a substituent. The substituent is a CH2 group attached to OH and another cyclohexyl group, and also a carbonyl group. Or maybe it's a branching point.

Wait, the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The carbaldehyde part is at position 1, and the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl is also at position 1? Or maybe the substituent is a methylene group (CH2) where one hydrogen is replaced by OH and another by cyclohexyl. So, the structure would have a cyclohexane ring, and at the same carbon, a carbonyl group (CHO), a hydroxyl (OH), and a cyclohexyl group attached via a methyl group (CH2) or is it directly attached? Wait, the substituent is (c
