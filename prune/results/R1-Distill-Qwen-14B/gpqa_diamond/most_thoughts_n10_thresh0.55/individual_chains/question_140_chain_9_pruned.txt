Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. Honestly, it's a bit complex, but I think I can break it down.

So, the question is about a chemical reaction involving Substance X. Let's read it again. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Then, there's another clue about a keto acid reacting with X to give a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's similar to another substance, which suggests it's a common reagent.

Hmm. Let's start by identifying possible substances. The reaction is violent, so maybe it's a strong acid reacting with something. Oh, wait, Liquid Y reacting with X. Violent reactions can involve things like metals reacting with acids, but maybe it's something else.

The gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. So, same number of each. Let me think—what gases fit that? Well, for example, He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if it's He-4). Or maybe CO2? Wait, no. CO2 has 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44 g/mol. But the molecule would be CO2: protons would be 6 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 6+32=38 protons. Neutrons? Carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, oxygen has 8 each, so 6 + 8*2 = 22. Not equal. Hmm. Wait, maybe H2O? No, H2O has 2 H (1 each) and O (8). Protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: O is 8, H is 1 each. So 8 + 2=10. Oh wait! H2O has 10 protons and 10 neutrons. So that fits. Or wait, maybe NH3? No, NH3 has 14 (N) + 3 (H) = 17 protons. Neutrons: Nitrogen has 7, H has 0 each. So 7 + 0 =7. Not same as protons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe CO? Let me see: C has 6 protons, O has 8. Total protons 14. Neutrons: C has 6 (if it's C-12), O is 8 (if O-16). So 6+8=14. Oh, so CO has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That fits. Or maybe CH4: 6 + 4 =10 protons. Neutrons: C-12 (6) + each H has 0. So 6. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Could W be CO2? Let's see. Protons: 6 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 6 +32=38. Neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8. So 6 + (8*2) =22. Not equal. So no. What else? Maybe CH3Cl? No, that's a molecule but not a common gas. Wait, maybe O2 or O3? O2 has 16 protons each, total 32. Neutrons: O is 8 each, so 16. 32 vs 16—nope. Alternatively, maybe argon as Ar? Ar has 18 protons, and 22 neutrons (if it's Ar-40). But that's not a molecule with same number of protons and neutrons. Hmm.

Wait another angle: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. I'm trying to think of a solid that melts around that temperature. Water? No, water melts at 273 K (0 C). Wait, 277
