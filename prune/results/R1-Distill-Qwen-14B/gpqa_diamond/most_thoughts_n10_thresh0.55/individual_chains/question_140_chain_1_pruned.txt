Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Hmm. I'll try to break this down. First, I think I need to identify each of these substances: X, Y, W, G, B.

Let's start with gas W. The molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule must be made of isotopes where the number of neutrons equals protons. Wait, actually, each atom in the molecule must have equal protons and neutrons. Or maybe the molecule as a whole? Wait, if it's a molecule, like H2O, but each atom in the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe the molecule's total protons equals total neutrons.

Wait, but the question says the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So for example, if it's H2O, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if it's protium), and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's the most common isotope). So in H2O, total protons would be 2 + 8 = 10; total neutrons would be 0 + 8 = 8. So that's not equal. So maybe, for the molecule, the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons.

Another possibility: maybe each atom in the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Like, for example, if the molecule is CH4. Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's carbon-12). Hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. But then the molecule would have 6 + 1*4 = 10 protons and 6 + 0*4 = 6 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't work.

Wait, another approach. The simplest gas is H2. Each H has 1 proton, 0 neut
