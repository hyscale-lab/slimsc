Okay, so I've got this question here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on a few factors, right?

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, are being observed. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter. So, Planet_1's period is P1 and P2 is 3P1? Wait, no, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is, say, 300 days, Planet_1's is 100 days. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is more massive—twice as massive as Planet_2's star. So M1 = 2 M2. But both stars have the same radius, which is interesting because usually more massive stars are bigger, but maybe Planet_2's star is evolved, so it's a bit larger but in this case, both have the same radius. So R1 = R2.

I need to figure out the transit probability for each planet. I think the transit probability depends on the orbital distance and the star's size. Wait, no, more specifically, the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But without knowing the inclination, which we don't, we can't directly measure it. But the probability is given by the ratio of the planet's orbital distance around the star in the plane of the sky to the star's radius, or something like that. Or wait, maybe the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, I think the transit probability (p) is given by p = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3)) )) ), but wait, no, that might be for the radial velocity method. Wait, maybe the transit probability is simply (R_star / a), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability P is approximately (R_*/a) * (sin i), but since the inclination i is random, the average probability is (R_*/a) * (1/(something)).

Wait, let me think again. Oh, right! The probability of a transit is given by the formula: P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3)) )) ), but wait, no, that's the probability of the radial velocity method detecting a planet. For transits, the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on. But the exact probability is given by (R*/a) * (1/(1 + (M*/M_p)^(1/3)) ) )? No, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I think the transit probability is (R_star/a) * (R_star/a) )? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, I've read that the geometric probability for a transit is (R_star / a), multiplied by the ratio of the semi-major axis to the distance, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's get back. The key factors for transit probability are the size of the
