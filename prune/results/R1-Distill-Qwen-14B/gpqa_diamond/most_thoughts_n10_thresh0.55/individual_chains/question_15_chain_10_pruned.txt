Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about which planet is more likely to transit its star from our point of view. Hmm, let me read through the problem again.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits, which probably means their orbits are more predictable. The host stars have the same radius, but the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Oh, and Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but I guess that doesn't matter much since the radii are the same.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. But wait, since both planets are Earth-like, perhaps their sizes are similar? Or maybe their masses don't directly correlate with size? Wait, actually, in the question, it says they have the same mass, so their radii might be similar as well. Hmm, but I'm not sure if Earth-like implies same radius. Maybe that's an assumption I can make, but perhaps I should think in terms of the formula.

The formula for the transit probability (P) is P = (R_planet / R_star)² * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)), where e is the eccentricity. But in this case, both planets have circular orbits, so e is 0. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else? Wait, no, wait. I think I might be mixing the formula. Let me get this right.

Wait, the transit probability is given by the formula: P = (R_planet / R_star)^2 * ( (a sin i) / (a) )^2 ), but wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star) depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2), but since e is zero here, that part is 1. So the main factor is (R_p / R_s)^2.

Wait, but in
