Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. So, four possibilities.

First, let's go through each piece of data step by step. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe something like a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's a strong hydrogen bond, which is typical for carboxylic acids. But I'm not sure yet.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 is a bit lower, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation or maybe an amide. But wait, the question says it's an unknown compound, so maybe it's something else. Oh wait, another possibility for 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Or maybe an aromatic ring with double bonds. Alternatively, it might be a carbonyl from an ester or a ketone and then maybe an aromatic ring.

Then looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond, possibly in a conjugated system.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Let me think about that. Common fragments around 45 could be something like a methyl group attached to something. Wait, 45 is the molecular ion of CH3OCH2CH2 (no, wait, that's not right. Let me think. 45 is actually the mass of (CH3)2O, which is 15 (CH3) + 15 (another CH3) + 16 (O) = 46? Wait, no, wait, 12*2 (
