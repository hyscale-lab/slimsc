Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass. The setup is a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which I remember is F = -kx. But wait, since it's relativistic, I can't use the classical equations directly, right? Because at high speeds, relativistic effects become important.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, the options here are relativistic, so I can't stop there.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; the total energy includes the rest mass energy. So the total energy E is gamma times mc². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is quantized, but I'm not sure if that applies here. The problem doesn't mention quantization, so maybe it's treating the oscillator classically but with relativistic considerations.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is when the entire potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But in
