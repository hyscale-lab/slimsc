Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2.
- The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, M1 = 1.5 * M2.
- Both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, which I think relates to their temperatures.
- Their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. Hmm, not sure how radial velocity plays into luminosity yet.
- The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, so the key here is probably to find the luminosity ratio, L1/L2. I remember that luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since σ is a constant, the ratio L1/L2 would be (R1²/R2²) * (T1⁴/T2⁴).

So, first, I need to find the temperature ratio T1/T2.

But the problem says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, that's the peak wavelength for each star's emission. I remember Wien's law, which states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

Since both stars have the same λ_max, that would mean their temperatures are the same. Wait, no. Wait, no, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, same λ_max implies same T for both stars? Because according to Wien's law, if λ_max is the same, then T is the same. So T1 = T2?

Wait, but that can't be right because the stars have different masses and radii. Because if their temperatures were the same, then their luminosities would depend only on their radii.

Wait, but let me think again. If both stars emit most strongly at the same wavelength, then their temperatures are the same.
