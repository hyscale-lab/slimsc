Okay, so I've got this astronomy question, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. Right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Oh wait, yes, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. That means if distance increases, parallax decreases.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/d. So plx = 1/d → plx^5 = (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. Then 1/plx^5 would be d^5. Oh wait, wait, because N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → N ∝ (d)^5, since 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Hmm, I think that's about the differential change. So it's like, how does the number of stars change as you move a small step in distance. So maybe I need to think in terms of differential calculus.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars as a function of distance is N(d) = k * d^5, where k is some constant. Now, to find how N changes with a small change in distance, I should take the derivative dN/dr. Let me compute that.

dN/dr = d(k d^5)/dd = 5k d^4. So the change in N per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to d^4. But wait, is that the right approach?

Alternatively, the question might be about the number of stars per unit volume or something else. Wait, the number density in a region as a function of distance. Or perhaps it's considering the volume of space that you're looking at. Let me think again.

Wait, the number of stars in a region might depend on the volume, which depends on distance. But according to the given relation, it's 1/plx^5. So, given
