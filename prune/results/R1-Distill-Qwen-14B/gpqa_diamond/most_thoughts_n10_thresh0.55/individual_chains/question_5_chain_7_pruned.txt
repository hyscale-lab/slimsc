Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a spin operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, I remember that spin-½ particles have their operators represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The direction here is along a vector n lying in the x-z plane.

The operator P is given for each component: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is (ħ/2) times a 2x2 matrix. So, the general form for the operator along direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y should be zero. So, the operator simplifies to P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, n is a unit vector, right? So n_x² + n_z² = 1. Let me think, n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, because in the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the x-axis. So n = (cosθ, 0, sinθ).

So the operator P is (ħ/2)( n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ). Substituting the matrices:

σ_x is [[0 1],[1 0]], and σ_z is [[1 0],[0 -1]]. So P becomes (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, right?

The eigenvector equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. Let me write the matrix form of P. Let me denote the matrices for clarity.

P = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So, the equation:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

n_z a + n_x b = a  
n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me write the first equation: n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0  
Second equation: n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0

Wait, maybe I can rewrite these equations. Let me rearrange the first equation:

(n_z - 1) a = -n_x b  
Similarly, second equation: n_x a = (n_z + 1) b

Hmm, perhaps I can express a in terms of b from the second equation. From the second equation: a = [(n_z + 1)/n_x] b

Wait, but n_x is cosθ, and n_z is sinθ. So a = [ (sinθ + 1) / cosθ ] * b

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me substitute n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ.

So the second equation becomes:

cosθ a = (sinθ + 1) b  
So a = [ (sinθ + 1) / cosθ ] b

Now, plugging this into the first equation:

sinθ a + cosθ b = a  
Substitute a:

sinθ [ (sinθ + 1) / cosθ b ] + cosθ b = [ (sinθ + 1) / cosθ ] b

Let me compute the left side:

[ sinθ (sinθ +1 ) / cosθ + cosθ ] b  
= [ (sinθ (sinθ +1 ) + cos²θ ) / cosθ ] b  
= [ ( sin²θ + sinθ + cos²θ ) / cosθ ] b  
But sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, so numerator becomes 1 + sinθ. So,

[ (1 + sinθ ) / cosθ ] b

Setting this equal to the right-hand side, which is [ (1 + sintheta)/ cos theta ] b.

So the equation holds, meaning there's a non-trivial solution. So, the eigenvector can be written as [ a, b ] where a = [ (sinθ + 1)/ cosθ ] b.

But wait, I think it's better to express in terms of a ratio. Let me set b = 1 (since eigenvectors are up to a scalar multiple), then a = (sinθ + 1)/ cosθ.

Wait, but that might not cover all possibilities. Alternatively, I can express the eigenvector as proportional to [ (sinθ +1 ), cosθ ].

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the equations. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Pauli matrices to find the eigenstates.

The eigenstates for spin in the direction n are given by:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |−z>

But wait, phi is zero here because n is in the x-z plane. So phi is 0 (since the direction is in x-z, so the angle around the y-axis is zero). So the state becomes:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + sin(theta/2) |↓>

Wait, but |↑> is (1, 0) and |↓> is (0,1). So the state is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait, that's for the eigenstate with eigenvalue +1/2 (in units where ħ is 1 and the eigenvalues are ±1/2). Wait, but in the problem, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, so that's correct.

But in our earlier calculation, using the matrix approach, we ended up with a = [ (sinθ +1 ) / cosθ ] b.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix formulation. Let me try another approach. Let me write the eigenvalue equation again.

The operator P is (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ). The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, no, wait. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So, the equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, that's right. So the matrix equation is:

[ [n_z, n_x ], [n_x, -n_z ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So, the equations are:

n_z a + n_x b = a  
n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me rearrange these equations.

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0  
Equation 2: n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0

So from equation 2: n_x a = (n_z + 1) b → a = [ (n_z + 1) / n_x ] b

But n_x is cosθ, n_z is sinθ. So,

a = [ (sinθ + 1) / cosθ ] b → a = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] b

Hmm, but when I substitute this into equation 1, I get:

sinθ * [ (1 + sinθ)/ cosθ ] b + cosθ * b = [ (1 + sinθ
