Okay, so I've got this question about molecular spectroscopy, specifically about the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that in such models, molecules can absorb photons that cause transitions between energy states. The question is about finding the momentum of the photon needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.

The given data includes the masses of atoms X and Y, the bond length R, and the angular frequency w. Let me jot those down:

Mx = 20 amu
My = 2 amu
R = 2 angstroms
w = 4e14 rad/s

Wait, I think I remember that the energy levels in a diatomic molecule involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. But the question says it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which probably means it's a non-rigid rotor. Oh wait, the non-rigid rotor model accounts for bond vibrations, so the bond length isn't fixed. But for the purposes of calculating the energy levels, maybe I can treat it as a rigid rotor for this problem? Or is the vibration part more important here?

Wait, the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is initially in the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state for the system. But what's the next state? Well, in rotational states, each transition is characterized by a change in the rotational quantum number. But also, vibrational states have their own quantum numbers.

Wait, but in the rotation-vibration model, the transition can involve both a change in vibrational and rotational states. But the question is about
