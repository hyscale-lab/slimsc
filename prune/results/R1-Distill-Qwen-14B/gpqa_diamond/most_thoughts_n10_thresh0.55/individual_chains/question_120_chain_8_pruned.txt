Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Let me think. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth as we orbit the Sun. The formula I remember is distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, and smaller parallax means it's farther away.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, it's asking about the distribution of stars as a function of parallax. The options are different power laws, like 1/plx^4 and so on.

Wait, I think this has to do with the volume of space. Because stars are spread out, the number you can see depends on how much volume is accessible at each distance. The number of stars in a given volume depends on their density. If they're uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume would be the same everywhere. But the volume itself depends on the distance.

Let me recall: the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. But since we're looking at a range of distances, maybe it's the shell volume? Oh right, because each shell at a certain distance contributes to the number of stars in that range.

So, for a small change in distance dr, the volume is 4πr² dr. That's the surface area of a sphere (4πr²) multiplied by dr, the thickness of the shell. So, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume, assuming uniform density.

Wait, but the question is about a unit range of parallax. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d. So, if plx increases by 1 unit, d decreases. Let me see: if plx = p, then d = 1/p. So, the distance changes as p changes.

Hmm, but how does the number of stars per unit plx range depend on p? Let's say I have a small change in plx, dp. What's the corresponding change in distance, dr?

Wait, let me think in terms of differentials. Since d = 1/p, then dr = - (1/p²) dp. The negative sign just indicates that as p increases, d decreases.

But the volume of the shell for each distance d is 4πd² dr. So, substituting dr from above, dr = - (1/p²) dp.

So the volume becomes 4π (d)^2 * dr. Since d is 1/p, d squared is 1/p². So,

Volume = 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p² dp) ) = -4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, since we're dealing with absolute numbers, the sign doesn't matter, so we can ignore the negative. So the volume is proportional to 1/p^4, and dp is the change in p.

But wait, the number of stars in a shell with parallax between p and p + dp would be the volume times the number density of stars, say n (number per unit volume). So the number of stars N is n * volume = n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) )? Wait,
