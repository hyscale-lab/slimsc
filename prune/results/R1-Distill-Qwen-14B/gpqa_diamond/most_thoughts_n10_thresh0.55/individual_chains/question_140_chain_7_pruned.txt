Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has molecules that contain the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G is formed. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is close to 4 degrees Celsius because 277 K is 4°C. I remember that water's melting point is 0°C and boiling point is 100°C, so 4°C is just a bit above freezing.

Next, the product of the reaction between a certain keto acid and substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe the product is something like an ester or a ketone derivative?

The question also mentions that substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. I'm trying to think of such reagents. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base used in organic reactions, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is something like sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which is a reducing agent. Wait, but the question says that substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe X is a metal hydride or something with isotopes.

Let me think about gas W. It's released when X reacts with liquid Y. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for a molecule, the total number of protons and neutrons must be equal. Let's consider possible gases. For example, H2 gas: each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not equal. O2: each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in the common isotope. O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So 32 protons and neutrons in total. So in O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so per molecule, 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So yes, that makes sense. Or maybe another gas like NH3? No, because N has 7 protons, H has 1. Let me think again.

Wait, the gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So, H2O? H2O has 2 H (each 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 2 + 8 =10. Neutrons: 8. So not equal. So that's out.

What about CO2? CO2 has one C (6 protons, 6 neutrons usually) and two O (8 each). So protons: 6 + 8*2=22. Neutrons: 6 + 8*2=22. Oh wait, that's 22 each. So for CO2, each molecule would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that fits the condition. So W could be CO2.

Alternatively, another possibility is something like NO. Let's see, NO has 7 (N) + 8 (O) protons =15. Neutrons: N has 7-14 neutrons (wait, N has 7 protons, common isotope is N-14 with 7 neutrons). O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So in NO, each molecule has 7+8=15 protons, and 7 (from N-14) +8=15 neutrons. So yes, that works too. So W could be NO or CO2.

Wait, but the reaction is between X and Y, which produces W and G. Let me think about possible reactions. For example, when metals react with acids, they produce hydrogen gas. But in that case, W would be H2. But H2's protons and neutrons don't match. So that's probably not.

Another possibility: if Y is water, and X is something that reacts with water. For example, sodium hydride (NaH) reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas, but that's H2, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with an acid (Y) to produce hydrogen. But again, H2 wouldn't fit. So maybe W is another gas.

Wait, if Y is a liquid, perhaps it's an acid? But I'm not sure. Another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is 277 K. That's just above freezing. What substance has a melting point around there? Well, water is 273 K, which is 0°C. But 277 is about 4°C. Hmm, maybe B is water? But that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps B is another compound
