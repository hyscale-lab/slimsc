Okay, let's try to work through this problem. Hmm, so we're dealing with a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. But wait, one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. The question is about how a planet's radius would compare to cause the same brightness variation as these spots when the star rotates.

So, the main point is that the star's brightness changes because of these spots, and we want to find the radius of a planet that would cause the same change if it were transiting the star. Because when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness.

Wait, but the spots are on the star's surface, and as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of the observed hemisphere. So when the spots are facing us, they block some light, making the star appear dimmer. But because they're cooler, maybe that's already accounted for in the brightness?

Wait, no. The effective temperature is the star's overall temperature. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, they contribute less light. So the total brightness variation comes from the area of the spots changing which part of the star we're seeing.

So the problem states that if the star weren't covered by spots, what planet radius would give the same amplitude in the light curve. So we need to compute the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

First, let's find the variation in brightness caused by the spots. The star's total luminosity without spots is L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. But because of the spots, part of the star is emitting less.

The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere is spots. Each spot has a temperature of 6000K - 1000K = 5000K. So when the star rotates, the hemisphere with the spots comes into view, and the other hemisphere is spot-free.

Wait, maybe the star is symmetric, but only one hemisphere has spots. So when the star rotates, we see the spotted hemisphere, then the other. So the variation in brightness is the difference between the two hemispheres.

Wait, but the star's entire surface emits
