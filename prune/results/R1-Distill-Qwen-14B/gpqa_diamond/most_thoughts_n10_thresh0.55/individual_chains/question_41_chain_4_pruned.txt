Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to an observer in a laboratory. Hmm, okay, I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, there are some relativistic effects to consider. But wait, the glass is moving at a constant velocity v, so maybe it's non-relativistic? I'm not sure.

The setup is that a light beam is propagating through the glass, which has an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass from the lab frame.

Wait, the speed of light in the glass is normally c/n, but when the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed? Oh right, I think this has to do with the Doppler effect or maybe frame of reference transformations.

Wait, if the glass is moving, the medium is moving. So perhaps I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh wait, but the problem says the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's in the same inertial frame, so we can use the velocity addition formula.

But wait, the speed of light in the glass is c/n in its rest frame. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So I need to find how the light's velocity transforms.

Wait, the velocity addition formula in special relativity is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/cÂ²). But wait, that's when we're changing frames from the medium's frame to the
