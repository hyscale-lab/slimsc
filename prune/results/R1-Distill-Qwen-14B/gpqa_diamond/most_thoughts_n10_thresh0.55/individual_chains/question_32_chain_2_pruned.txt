Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and I need to find the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

First, the problem states that the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 (since 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons). So the mass number A is 6.

So nucleus X is Li-6. Now, I need to find the energy of RHIC when the speed v is 0.96 times the speed of light, c.

I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a particle is given by the relativistic energy formula. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, what's the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus? The rest mass energy would be the mass of the nucleus multiplied by c squared. But wait, I don't have the mass given directly. How do I find the mass of Li-6?

Oh right, the atomic mass of Li-6. I think the atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.660539 × 10^-27 kg. But wait, I also need to account for the molar mass. Alternatively, perhaps I can
