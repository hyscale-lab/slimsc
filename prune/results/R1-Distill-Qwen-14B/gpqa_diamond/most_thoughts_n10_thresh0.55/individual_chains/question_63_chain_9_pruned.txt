Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let's parse the given data. The molecule consists of atoms X and Y. Their masses are 20 amu and 2 amu, respectively. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration ω is 4e14 rad/s. 

Wait, okay, so the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid (or vibrationally accurate) model allows for changes in bond length. But how does that affect the energy levels?

I think the energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be considered as a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher state. But what's the next state in terms of energy?

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. The total energy is given by something like E = E_rot + E_vib. But wait, maybe it's more accurate to model it as a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, but for diatomic molecules, it's a two-dimensional oscillator because the vibration is along the bond axis. Hmm, not entirely sure, but let's proceed.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. The next state would probably be the next higher energy state, which could involve either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that means the smallest possible energy increment. So I need to consider the energy differences between the states.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. The next state would be the first excited state. But which transition is allowed? Because for a diatomic molecule, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are that the rotational quantum number J can change by ±1, and the vibrational quantum number ν can change by ±1. But wait, no, the vibrational selection rule is Δν =
