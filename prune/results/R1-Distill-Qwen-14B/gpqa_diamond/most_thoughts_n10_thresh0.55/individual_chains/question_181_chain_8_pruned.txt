Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about neutrinos from the Sun, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question is about the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands right after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find the ratio flux1/flux2. The options are A to D, with some varying by factors of 10 or just 1.

Wait, what do I know about the pp-III branch and neutrino production? The pp chain is the proton-proton chain, which is the main source of the Sun's energy. The pp-I branch produces some deuterium, then the pp-II and pp-III branches... Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch is the dominant one, producing helium-4. So if the pp-III stops, that would have a big impact on the neutrinos.

Solar neutrinos are mainly produced in the proton-proton chain. The main neutrino emission comes from the decay of beryllium-7, which occurs in the pp-III branch. The neutrinos produced are electron neutrinos (Î½_e) when a boron-8 nucleus emits a positron and a neutrino. These neutrinos then travel through the Sun and reach Earth.

If the pp-III branch stops, that would mean that the neutrino production from that process would stop. But wait
