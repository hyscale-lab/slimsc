Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, I remember that FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spec are all common techniques used for this. Let's break down the clues one by one.

First, the FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Oh right, that broad peak is probably from O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak might indicate hydrogen bonding, which is more typical of something like an alcohol or maybe a ketone? Wait, no, ketones have a C=O stretch around 1700, which is the case here. But the broad O-H suggests maybe an -OH group like in an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H around 2500-3300, and their C=O is around 1700. So the presence of a broad peak at 3000 could be either, but let's see other data.

The FTIR also shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Wait, 1700 is a classic C=O stretch. The 1650 might be another carbonyl group or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds or an amine? No, amines have N-H stretches. Maybe an aromatic ring's C=C stretching? But wait, in aromatic compounds, the C=C absorption is usually around 14
