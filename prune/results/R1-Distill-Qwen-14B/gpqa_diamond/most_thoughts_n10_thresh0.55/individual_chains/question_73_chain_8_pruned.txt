Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's start breaking it down.

Wait, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options give different values for v_rel and E.

First, I think about the relative speed. But wait, in relativity, speeds don't just add up normally. Oh right! The velocity addition formula is needed here. The formula for relative velocity when moving at speeds u and v in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, is it (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)) or the other way around? Let me make sure. Since both are in the positive x-direction, the relative speed of the 2m astronaut (at 0.6c) with respect to the 3m astronaut (0.5c) would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by 1 minus (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). So that's 0.1c in the numerator. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is roughly 0.14c. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have this.

Next, I need to calculate the total energy of the system. The total energy is the sum of their rest energies and their kinetic energies, but wait, in relativity, energy is given by gamma times mc² for each object.

So for each astronaut, I calculate their gamma factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For the first astronaut (2m, 0.6c):
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So their energy is gamma * m * c² * mass. Wait, their mass is
