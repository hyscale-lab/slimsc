Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But when I see this particular ρ, it looks familiar. I think it might be a diagonal matrix, which would mean it's a classical mixture of states, not a quantum superposition.

Wait, so what do I know about the Bloch sphere representation? Oh right, any single-qubit state can be represented on a unit sphere. For pure states, it's a point on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ> is |ψ><ψ|, and for a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture of such projectors.

Looking at ρ, it's (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. Does that mean it's an equal mixture of |0> and |1>? Because each term is equally weighted, each with probability 1/2. So ρ is a classical mixture of the two basis states.

Now, how does this translate into the Bloch sphere coordinates? The Bloch vector (r) has three components: (x, y, z), which correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz. For a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector. So if I can express ρ in that form, I can find r.

Let me write out ρ in matrix form. The |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So ρ is (1/2)([[1,0],[0,0]] + [[0,0],[0,1]] ) = [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]]. So the density matrix is diagonal with 1/2 on the diagonal.

Now, the general form is (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz ) / 2. Let's compute each term.

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 is [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]], which is exactly what ρ is when r_x, r_y, r_z are zero. Because when I compute ρ = (I + 0*σx + 0*σy + 0*σz ) /2, it matches.

So the Bloch vector r must be (0, 0, 0). That would place the state at the origin in the Bloch sphere. Because it's a completely mixed state, it's in the center, not on the surface.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check. If a system is in a completely mixed state, the Bloch vector has zero magnitude, so it's at the origin. Yes, that's right. So the geometrical position is at the origin, which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the two basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. Any single-qubit state can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. The components of \(\mathbf{r}\) correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.

For the given \(\rho\), expanding it in matrix form yields:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This matches the general form \(\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\) only when \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This means the Bloch vector has zero magnitude, placing the state at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Since the state is a completely mixed state, it corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is at the origin, corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
