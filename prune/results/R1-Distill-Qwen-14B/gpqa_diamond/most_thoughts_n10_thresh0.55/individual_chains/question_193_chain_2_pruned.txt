Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5), right? And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r.

Hmm, wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. But wait, units are in parsecs I think, because in astronomy, parallax is usually in arcseconds and the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 over distance (in parsecs). So if distance d increases, plx decreases.

So the given is N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Let me express N in terms of distance. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/(plx) is d. So 1/(plx^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number changes per unit range of distance. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx^5) = d^5. So N increases with d^5. But the question is about the change in the number of stars as a function of distance. Wait, they're asking, how does the number change with distance, per unit range. So maybe they're asking about the differential, like the rate of change of N with distance.

Oh, I think I need to find dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r, where r is the distance. Because that would tell me how the number increases or decreases per unit distance.

So if N ∝ d^5, then N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. Taking the derivative of N with respect to d, I get dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the change in N per unit change in d is proportional to d^4. 

Wait, but the options are giving relationships with r, which I think is the same as d here. So the change in number of
