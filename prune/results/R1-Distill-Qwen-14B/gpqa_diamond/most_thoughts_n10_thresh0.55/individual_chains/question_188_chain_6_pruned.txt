Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state chemistry, but I think I can figure this out. Let's see what the question says.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. All the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, and I have to pick the correct one.

Wait, interatomic distance... Oh, right, in a crystal structure, the interatomic distance refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice. But in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, and the angles are equal too. So this is a special case where it's like a cube but with all angles being 30 degrees instead of 90. So it's a rhombohedral or trigonal crystal system.

Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for that is given by the Bragg's law equation, but more importantly, the interplanar distance d_hkl is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor, which for cubic systems is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - sqrt(2)(hk + hl + kl) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2)(sin^2 α) + (k^2)(sin^2 β) + (l^2)(sin^2 γ) - 2hk cos(αβ) - 2hl cos(αγ) - 2kl cos(βγ) ) )

Wait, no, that might be for orthorhombic systems or something else. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the unit cell vectors.

Another approach: The interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ can be found using the formula:

1/d^2 = (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) - 2hk cos γ/(a b) - 2hl cos β/(a c) - 2kl cos α/(b c)

Wait, but in
