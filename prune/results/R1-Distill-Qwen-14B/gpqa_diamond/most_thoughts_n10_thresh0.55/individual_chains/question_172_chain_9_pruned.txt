Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, the problem mentions the energy difference between the energy levels is about 1.38e-23 J. And we're supposed to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2, assuming LTE.

Right, LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which means that each region of the star's photosphere behaves like a blackbody in thermal equilibrium. So the excitation states of the atoms should follow the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

The excitation level depends on the Boltzmann factor. The population ratio between two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. For two energy levels with energies E_upper and E_lower, the ratio of their populations (n_upper / n_lower) is equal to the Boltzmann factor: (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k*T) )

In this problem, the excited state is the upper level, so if star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2, the ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2 it's 1? Or wait, maybe I need to clarify. Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So if the lower level is ground state, and the upper is excited, then n_upper for star_1 is twice that of star_2's n_upper. Or maybe the ratio between the two stars for the same level is 2:1.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for the same energy level, the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2). Or perhaps we're considering the same state in both stars. Hmm, maybe I should think of the ratio of the populations in each star.

Assume that both stars are considering the same energy levels. Let's say the energy difference between the two levels is ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. For each star, the ratio of the excited state to the lower state is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1: (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = exp( -ΔE / (k T1) ) * (g_upper / g_lower)

For star_2: (n_upper2 / n_lower2) = exp( -ΔE / (k T2) ) * (g_upper / g_lower)

Wait, but the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. I think it's probably the ratio of the excited state populations. So maybe (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2)

But wait, perhaps star_1's excitation is twice as much as star_2's. So, the ratio of the excited states is 2:1. So (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) =
