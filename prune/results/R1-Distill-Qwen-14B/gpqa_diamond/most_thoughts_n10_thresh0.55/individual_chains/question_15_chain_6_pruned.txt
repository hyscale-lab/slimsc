Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher chance because they have limited time. Let me think through the information given.

Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So their minimum masses are known, but we don't know their exact masses. Oh wait, but the question says both share the same masses. So mass isn't a factor here. 

The RV method tells us about the planet's mass and orbital period. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star. That makes sense because shorter orbital periods usually mean closer orbits.

Both have circular orbits, which is good because eccentricity affects the transit probability, but here it's the same for both. So that's not a variable here.

The stars: Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. The host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, but their radii are the same. Wait, evolved stars are usually larger, but here they have same radii, so maybe Planet_1's star is more massive but same size, which might mean it's hotter or something. But for transiting probability, the main factors are the size of the star and the size of the planet, and the orbital distance.

Wait, the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula: P = (R_planet + R_star) / a * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3)) )) or something? Wait, maybe I'm mixing different formulas. Hmm.

Wait, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is proportional to (R_planet + R_star) / a, where a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius), but also considering the inclination. Wait, no, the probability is actually the ratio of the size of the star and the planet relative to the orbital distance. More precisely, the probability is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a. But wait, R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's roughly R_star / a. Because if the planet's orbit is edge-on, there's a chance it will pass in front of the star. The probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can be aligned in front of the
