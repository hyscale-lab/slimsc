Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to make a certain nucleus move at 0.96c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X is. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. Got it, X is a Li-6 nucleus.

Now, the RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so here it's a Li-6 nucleus. The speed given is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus at this speed.

I remember that in relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(c^2)).

Let me write down the formula. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in. So v squared is (0.96c)^2, which is 0.9216 c². Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784), which is... let me calculate that. Well, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, 0.28 is a rough approximation. Let me calculate it more accurately. Hmm, because 0.28^2 is exactly 0.0784, so yeah, that's correct. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28 equals approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. 1 divided by 0.28 is like 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

The next step is to find the rest mass energy of the Li nucleus. The rest mass energy is m c². The mass of the Li-6 nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. Wait, I think the atomic mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons, minus the binding energy, but in terms of energy, perhaps I should use the mass in atomic mass units (u) and convert that to GeV.

I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So since the nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u.

So the total mass is 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) u.

Calculating that: 3*1.007276 is approximately 3.021828. And 3 * 1.008665 is about 3.025995. Adding them together gives 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that the correct approach? Because the actual mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum due to binding energy, but since the problem doesn't give any specific data, perhaps we're supposed to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Or maybe it's more accurate to use the atomic
