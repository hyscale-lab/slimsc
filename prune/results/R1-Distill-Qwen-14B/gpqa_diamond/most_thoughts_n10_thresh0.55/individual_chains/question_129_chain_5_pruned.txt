Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question gives a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form E. Let's list out what each step does.

First, compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B. Hmmm, when I think of HCN reactions, it's often about adding a cyanide group. If A is a ketone, HCN might add to the carbonyl group, forming a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin of A. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, the same applies. But looking at the hints, maybe A is a ketone.

Next, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C. Oh, hydrogenation with palladium usually is a catalytic hydrogenation. So if B is a nitrile or an alkyne, maybe it's hydrogenated. But wait, B comes from A + HCN. If A was a ketone, B would have a hydroxyl and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. So B would be a CH(OH)CN structure. Then when hydrogenated, perhaps the nitrile group (CN) is reduced to CH2NH2? Or wait, maybe it's a ketone to an alcohol? Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, HCN adds to a carbonyl, making a cyanohydrin. So A is a ketone. Then B is a secondary alcohol with a CN group attached. So when B is hydrogenated, maybe the nitrile group is reduced to a CH2NH2 group? But that might not make sense in this context. Or perhaps the double bond is hydrogenated if B had a double bond. Wait, no, the cyanide addition would form a secondary alcohol adjacent to a nitrile group. So compound B is a cyanohydrin, like R2C(OH)CN.

Then, compound C is formed after hydrogenation. So H2 and Pd would likely reduce the nitrile group. Oh wait, nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe B has another reducible group. Wait, if B is a cyanohydrin, the only reducible group would be the nitrile. So
