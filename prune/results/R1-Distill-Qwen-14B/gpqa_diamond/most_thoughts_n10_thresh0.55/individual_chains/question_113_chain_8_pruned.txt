Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question says that the FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, another peak at 1700 and 1650. Oh right, 1700 is often a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe an aldehyde. The 1650 could be conjugated double bonds or an aromatic ring. Or maybe an amide, but I don't think that's relevant here.

The 1H NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're attached to a double bond, so the molecule probably has some sort of unsaturated structure, maybe an alkene or aromatic ring. Also, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that there are protons on a double bond, so maybe something like a substituted ethylene or part of a benzene ring.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH3 (dimethyl ether) but wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of (CH3)2O (dimethyl ether is 45, yeah). Or, wait, maybe it's something else. Another possibility is that 45 could come from a fragment like CH2CH2O or something. Alternatively, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)3COH? No, wait, (CH3)3COH is 46. Or maybe the fragment is (CH3)2O, which is 45.

Now, looking at the options for the chemical formula:

A) C6H12O2: So that's like something with two oxygen-containing groups. Maybe an ester or a ketone plus an alcohol.

B) C6H10O: That's a formula with one oxygen. Maybe an alcohol with a double bond or a ketone.

C) C6H10O2: Two oxygen atoms, perhaps an ester or a ketone and an alcohol, or maybe a carboxylic acid and something else.

D) C6H12O: One oxygen atom. Could be an alcohol or an ether.

So, let's go through each clue.

First, the FTIR: a broad peak at 3000 cm-1 suggests O-H. The strong peaks at 1700 and 1650... 1700 is a carbonyl, so maybe ester, ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be conjugated double bonds or aromatic. But if the molecule has both a carbonyl and another peak in that area, perhaps it's an ester? Because esters have carbonyls around 1700-1750. Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, which would have a carbonyl around 1700 and another absorption around 1650 for the double bond.

The 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So maybe there's a double bond, perhaps conjugated to the carbonyl. That would explain the 1650 peak. So maybe something like a vinyl group attached to a carbonyl, like an acrylate or similar.

Now, the mass spec. The fragment at 45. Let's think about possible fragments. If the molecule is, say, an ester, maybe the ester group would break into parts. For example, in an ester like CH3COOCH2CH3, the cleavage could produce a fragment with CH3COO- (which is 60) or something else. Alternatively, if the molecule is more complex, perhaps a fragment like CH2CH2O or CH2CO... Hmm, 45 is also the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO (acetone is 58, no, wait. Oh wait, (CH3)2CO is 58. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me calculate: CH3OCH3 is 12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 24+6+16=46. Wait, that doesn't add up. Oh wait, molecular formula of dimethyl ether is C2H6O. Molecular weight: 2*12=24, 6*1=6, 16=16. Total 46. Oh, so 45 is one less. Hmm. Maybe it's a fragment that's CH2OCH3? That's 12+2 +16+12+3= 12+2 is 14, 16 is 16, 12 is 12 for OCH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively,
