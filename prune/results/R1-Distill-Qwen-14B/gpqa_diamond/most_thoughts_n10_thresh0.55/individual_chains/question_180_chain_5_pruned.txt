Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. So 2e is like twice the charge of a proton or electron, depending on the sign. But wait, the problem doesn't specify positive or negative, but in potential energy calculations, the sign might matter for the minimum energy. Oh, but since we're talking about the minimum energy, maybe the arrangement affects it.

So the setup is: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. Oh, right, the system's electric potential energy.

Wait, the system's electric potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs. So for each pair of charges, I calculate the potential energy between them and sum them all up.

But first, let me clarify: the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. So the distance between the 13th charge and each of the others is 2 meters.

So each pair involving the 13th charge has a distance of 2 meters. The other 12 charges are each 2 meters away from P, but what about the distance between them? Hmm, this is a point I need to think about. Are the 12 charges arranged in some way, like equally spaced on a sphere? Or are they all at the same point? Wait, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. So they must be on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m. But since they're point charges and identical, I might not need their exact arrangement because of the way potential energy sums work.

Wait, the potential energy depends on the distance between each pair. So for the 12 charges at 2m from P (which has the 13th charge), their mutual distances vary. But wait, the question is about the minimum energy. Hmm, perhaps arranging the 12 charges as far apart as possible would minimize the potential energy. Because if the charges are repelling (assuming
