Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is asking for the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are given, each as ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, so the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operator along an arbitrary direction is given by the dot product of the vector of operators (like P) with the direction vector n. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n must be zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

But the problem says that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the eigenvector should depend on the angles defining the direction. Wait, but the options given don't all have trigonometric functions. Hmm, maybe I should think about how the spin operators work.

Wait, the operator P here is probably the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle, like a muon. So the eigenvectors correspond to spin-up or spin-down along a particular direction.

Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, I'm looking for the spin-up state along direction n.

The general expression for the spin operator along direction n is S = (n_x S_x + n_y S_y + n_z S_z). For a spin-1/2 particle, each component S_i is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices.

In this problem, the operator P must be similar to the spin operator. So, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But in our case, n_y is zero because it's in the x-z plane. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but the given P_x, P_y, P_z are each (ħ/2) times their respective matrices. So P_x is (ħ/2) times the sigma_x matrix, same for the others.

Wait, the sigma_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y is
