Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all angles are the same. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and each angle alpha, beta, gamma is 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interatomic distance... I think that's the distance between atoms in the crystal structure. But in a rhombohedral system, how does that relate to the lattice parameters? Oh right, in a rhombohedral unit cell, the lattice is a cube that's been skewed, but all edges are the same length. So the interatomic distance would be the edge length 'a' of the rhombohedral system. So a = 10 Angstroms.

Now, interplanar distance for a crystal plane is calculated using the formula from X-ray diffraction. The formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) ) ). Wait, no, wait. I think I might be mixing something up. Oh right, in a cubic system, the formula is simpler, but in a general system, especially rhombohedral, it's a bit more involved.

The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

Wait, no, actually, I think I might have that wrong. Let me think again. Oh, right, the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) )

Wait, but wait, for a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, right? Because in this case, alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. So that might simplify the calculation.

So for the given (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1² + 1² + 1²) + 2[1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 ]
