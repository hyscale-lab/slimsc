Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see. It's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. The solution has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. Oh right, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+.

Wait, I think I need to recall the concept of complex formation and how the formation constant relates to the concentrations. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I can assume that all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. But wait, no, because the complex can dissociate a little, releasing some Ca²+ and EDTA.

So, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is negligible, then the concentration of Ca²+ would be very low. But wait, no, the K is so large (5e10), which means the complex is very stable. So, the dissociation would be minimal. Therefore, the concentration of free Ca²+ would
