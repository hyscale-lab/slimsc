Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the spectroscopy stuff yet. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the HI (hydroiodic acid) cleavage reaction, usually for the cleavage of double bonds, especially in alkenes. The reaction is called the hydroboration-oxidation? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think that's different. Oh, right, hydroiodic acid is used in the oxymercuration and other similar reactions. Wait, no, another thing: when an alkene reacts with HI, it typically does an addition reaction, like a halogenation. But wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, another thought: when you have an alkene and you use red phosphorus and HI, it's the Fries rearrangement? No, wait, the Fries rearrangement is something else. Oh, wait, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, maybe I should start by figuring out what Compound X is. Because if I can determine X's structure, then I can figure out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

So, the data given are IR and NMR. Let's look at the IR first. The IR peaks are: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably O-H stretch or N-H. Then 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak. That
