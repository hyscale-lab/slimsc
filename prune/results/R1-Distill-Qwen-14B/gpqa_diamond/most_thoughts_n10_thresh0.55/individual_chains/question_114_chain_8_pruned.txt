Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O), leading to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each giving different A and B reagents.

Hmm. Let me think about each step. 

First, the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, I'm thinking of nucleophilic addition reactions. Normally, in a ketone, the carbonyl group is attacked by a nucleophile. So, NaCN would provide CN- as the nucleophile. But wait, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Oh, right! I think this is an example of the cyanohydrin formation.

Cyanohydrin formation occurs when a ketone reacts with HCN (or a source of CN- like NaCN) in the presence of an acid catalyst. The mechanism involves the acid protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. The CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, creating a new carbon-carbon bond. Then, water or another acid helps in the proton transfer, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin, which is a compound with both a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon.

So, for the first reaction, reagent A must be an acid catalyst. Looking at the options, A could be either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Because NaHSO3 is a source of H+ as well, since it's a sulfonic acid. Wait, but in the cyanohydrin formation, the usual catalyst is an acid like H2SO4 or H3O+. So A probably is H3O+ or another strong acid.

Moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids, but the conditions matter. Let me think about the common oxidizing agents. In acidic conditions, nitriles can be hydrolyzed. Wait, hydrolysis of nitriles typically occurs under acidic or basic conditions. For example, under strong acidic conditions with heat, a nitrile can hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, another way is using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 under acidic conditions. But in this case, the reagent B is H2O. Wait, no, the reagent is B, which is H2O, but wait, does the reaction involve more than just water? Or perhaps H2O is a solvent, and B is a catalyst or another reagent.

Wait, the question says: second reaction is with B (H2O) as a reagent.
