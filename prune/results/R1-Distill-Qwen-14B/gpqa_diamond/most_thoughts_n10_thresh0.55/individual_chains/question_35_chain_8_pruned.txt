Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of angular momentum and matrix representations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me read through the setup again.

Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). The matrix S has the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. So I can write S as:

S = [ [0, -i],
      [i, 0] ]

So Ay = c * S. Let's compute c first. Since c is h/(4π), then Ay would be:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Hmm, I remember that for Pauli matrices, the structure is similar. Oh wait, S here looks like the Pauli Y matrix, which is usually represented as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, and c is (h/(4π)).

Wait, but intrinsic angular momentum operators are usually given in terms of ħ times the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, right, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, because each component of spin has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So maybe that's relevant here.

So the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) * S, and since S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but let me think again. Let me compute the eigenvalues of S first.

Wait, S is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues of S can be found by solving det(S - λ I) = 0.

So let's compute that. The matrix is [[-λ, -i], [i, -λ]]. The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(i) = λ² - (i^2). Since i^2 is -1, so determinant is λ² - (-1) = λ² + 1.

Set determinant to zero: λ² +1=0 → λ = ±i. Wait, that's the eigenvalues of S. But wait, that can't be right because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, right? Wait, no, wait. Let me
