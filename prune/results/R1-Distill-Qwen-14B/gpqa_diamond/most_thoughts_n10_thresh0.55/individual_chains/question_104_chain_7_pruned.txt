Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. So the star moves towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of the planets based on the detected Doppler shifts.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, what's the Doppler shift related to? I think it's related to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift. Or maybe the shift is directly proportional to the velocity.

The Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. Since the shifts are given in milliangstroms, but the actual wavelength (λ) might cancel out when comparing the same spectral line for both stars.

So for each planet, the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift. So if the shift for #1 is 5 and #2 is 7, then K2/K1 would be 7/5 = 1.4. But wait, how does K relate to the orbital period?

I recall the formula for K when using the radial velocity method. The velocity semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period and semi-major axis. Oh wait, but the planet masses are similar to Neptune, so the same. The stars' masses are the same as the Sun. So the K should be related to the planet's orbital parameters.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (P) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/1) )

But since P is the orbital period, and e is zero here (circular orbits), so the formula simplifies. Wait, but M_p is much
