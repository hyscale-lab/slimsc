Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has 3 protons normally. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which I think has a mass number A=6.

I remember that the energy in particle accelerators is usually given in terms of the kinetic energy or the total energy. But wait, when they say the energy of the collider, do they mean the kinetic energy per particle or the total energy including rest mass? Oh right, in high-energy physics, they often talk about the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But sometimes, especially when speeds are a significant fraction of c, relativistic effects are important.

The problem says the speed is 0.96c. So I think I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus, which would be gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first, let me calculate gamma. v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². Let me compute that: 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, since 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.
