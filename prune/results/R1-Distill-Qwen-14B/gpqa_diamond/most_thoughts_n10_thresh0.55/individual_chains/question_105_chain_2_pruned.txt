Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how it's being observed. The main point is comparing the brightness variation caused by a planet to that caused by spots on the star. Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, spots on the star can cause brightness variations as the star rotates.

So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness changes. The question is saying this setup can mimic an exoplanet causing a similar light curve. But if the star wasn't spotted, how big a planet would cause the same signal amplitude? We need to find Rpl/Rstar.

Wait, the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same. So I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness due to both the spots and the planet, then set them equal and solve for the planet's radius relative to the star.

First, let's think about the planet transit scenario. The dip in brightness (the transit depth) is given by (Rp / Rstar)^2. That's because the area blocked is the area of the planet relative to the star.

Now, what about the spots causing the variation? Well, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So as the star is spotted on one hemisphere, the total brightness changes as spots rotate in and out. The key is the difference in brightness when spots are visible and when they're not.

The star's total brightness without spots would be based on its effective temperature. But with spots, each spot is cooler, so when spots are facing us, the total light decreases.

The filling factor is 20%, which means 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, the hemisphere is half the star, so the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2). Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots, right? So each spot covers a certain area, and the total is 20% of the hemisphere's surface.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000K. The spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K.

The star emits light based on the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. But when spots are present, the total emitted flux is the sum of the normal star and the spots.

But wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. The change in brightness depends on how much of the star's surface is covered by spots and their temperature compared to the rest.

Let me model this. The star's total brightness when spots are present is the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area. The unspotted area is (1 - 0.2) of the hemisphere, and the spotted area is 0.2 of the hemisphere. Since each spot is on the hemisphere, which is half the star's surface, the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π R² / 2) = 0.1 π R².

But wait, when the star is observed, the hemisphere with spots is either facing us or not. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. The brightness variation will depend on the area of the spots relative to the star's surface.

Wait, no. Because the star is a sphere, but when it's rotating, the hemisphere that's facing us changes. So when the star's spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute to the light, but when it's not, they don't. So the maximum and minimum brightness depends on when the spots are visible or not.

Wait, let's think about the star's brightness when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. The total flux emitted is the sum of the flux from the unspotted
