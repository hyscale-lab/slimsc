Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

It says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible. Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and the options are given.

Hmm, I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because the particles are charged and their arrangement affects the potential energy.

Wait, the charges are identical. So, same sign. Because each is 2e. So, since all are same charges, they would repel each other.

The 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, all 12 are at the same distance from P, but are they arranged in some particular way? Like, are they all at the same point? Probably not, because that would cause infinite repulsion. Wait, but the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So maybe they form a sphere around P? Or are they each at a single point 2 m away, but free to move on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m. But since their mass is negligible, maybe they are point charges on the surface.

Wait, but the system's energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. Since each charge is 2e, the potential energy between any two
