Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries all operators must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. Let me think about each one.

First, what do I remember about symmetries in effective field theories? Effective theories are built by adding higher-dimensional operators that preserve the symmetries of the underlying theory, which in this case is the Standard Model. The Standard Model has the gauge symmetry of SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), as well as other symmetries like Lorentz symmetry.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is a spacetime symmetry. All terms in the Lagrangian should respect this because the SM does. So SMEFT operators must preserve Lorentz symmetry. That would mean operator terms are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. So point 1 is correct.

Now, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since the SM respects Poincare, the SMEFT should too. But wait, when you add higher-dimension operators, do they automatically respect translations? Well, the operators are part of a Lagrangian, so they should be local, which implies they have the right transformation properties under translations. So the SMEFT terms should respect Poincare symmetry. So point 2 is correct as well.

CP symmetry is another thing. CP is Charge conjugation combined with Parity. The Standard Model has some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. But do the SMEFT operators have to preserve CP? I thought that the SMEFT doesn't necessarily require CP symmetry. Because the underlying SM doesn't have CP conservation (except in some sectors), the effective operators don't need to preserve it either. So point 3 might not be required.

CPT symmetry is different. CPT is a combination of Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric because it's a Lorentz-invariant theory, and Lorentz symmetry enforces CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT, because the underlying theory does. So point 4 is correct.

Let me recap: Which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect?

1. Lorentz Symmetry - Yes.

2. Poincare symmetry - Yes. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and Poincare includes translations and Lorentz. Wait, but when you add higher-dimension operators, do they automatically respect translations? Well
