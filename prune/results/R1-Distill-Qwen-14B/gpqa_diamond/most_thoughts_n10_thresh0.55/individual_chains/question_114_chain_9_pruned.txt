Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me see what it's about. Alright, the question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Hmm.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and some reagent B, along with water, to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each pairing reagents A and B.

Let me break this down. Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? That's methylacetone. When ketones react with HCN (which I think is what NaCN would provide in solution), I remember that it's a nucleophilic addition. So, the mechanism would be the HCN adding to the carbonyl group.

Wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure quickly. The molecule has a nitrile group (CN), a hydroxyl (OH), and a methyl group (CH3) all attached to the same carbon. Oh, that makes sense because when HCN adds to a ketone, it produces a cyanohydrin. So the product is a cyanohydrin.

Wait, but how does the reaction proceed? I think the reaction between ketones and HCN is acid-catalyzed. Oh right, the mechanism involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- (from NaCN) attacks the carbonyl carbon, and water leaves as H2O, but since it's a ketone, the product would be the cyanohydrin. So for this reaction, the reagent A would be an acid, like H3O+ (which is H+ in water), or maybe another acid like H2SO4. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but for the cyanohydrin formation, the usual conditions are acidic. So the first step is the addition of HCN to the ketone, which is facilitated by an acid catalyst. So
