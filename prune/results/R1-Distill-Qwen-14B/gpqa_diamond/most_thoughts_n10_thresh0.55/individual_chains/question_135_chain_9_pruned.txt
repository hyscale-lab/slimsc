Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my notation, but I think I can parse this.

Wait, actually, the Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ_f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So it looks like X is a boson field, and it's interacting with fermions ψ_f. The term involves ψ_f-bar times X, multiplied by some coupling λ and a fermion mass term v, maybe? I'm not entirely sure, but I think it's a Yukawa-type interaction because it's between a boson and fermions in a similar structure.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A to D, each listing possible decay channels.

So, the key here is understanding what particles X can decay into. For a decay to be allowed, the energy (mass) of X must be at least equal to the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. Also, the interaction term determines which particles can be produced.

From the Lagrangian, the interaction is X ψ ψ. So that suggests that X can couple to any fermion ψ. Because in the interaction term, X is multiplying the fermion fields. So the decay X → ψ ψ-bar would be possible, right? Because fermions have to be created in pairs, as they are antiparticles.

Wait, but wait—what's the structure of the vertex? The interaction term is something like X ψ ψ-bar. So the vertex would involve X coupling to two fermions. That means X can decay into a fermion and its antiparticle. So possible decay modes are X → f f-bar, for any fermion f that X can interact with.

So the question is, which fermions can X decay into? That depends on whether the interaction term allows it, which depends on whether the fermion is present in the Lagrangian.

But the problem is that the given Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I misread that. Let me parse this again. It's -λ f times ψ_f-bar times (v + X) times ψ_f. Wait, perhaps the notation is that f is a fermion field, but that's a bit confusing because ψ_f is also a fermion field. Maybe the term is λ f (like Yukawa coupling) times ψ_f-bar (y) times (v + X(y)) times ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the notation, but perhaps the interaction is between X and the fermion ψ_f with a Yukawa coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is λ f ψ_f-bar X ψ_f. If that's the case, then the interaction is X ψ ψ-bar.
