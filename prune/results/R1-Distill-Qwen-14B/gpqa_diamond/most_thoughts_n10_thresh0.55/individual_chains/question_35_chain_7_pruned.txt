Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is c multiplied by S. The constant c is h divided by 4π. Oh right, h is Planck's constant. And S is a 2x2 matrix whose first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). 

Wait, I think I remember that for spin-½ particles, the Pauli matrices are involved. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 and represent the spin operators. Each Pauli matrix is multiplied by ħ/2, where ħ is h/(2π). So, the S matrix here must be one of those Pauli matrices scaled somehow.

Let me double-check the form of S. The given S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is usually:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]
Which matches exactly with S. Oh right! So S is the Pauli Y matrix, σ_y. 

So the operator A_y is c multiplied by σ_y. Since c is h/(4π), let me compute that. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Let's recall that eigenvalues of a matrix operator are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

So let's write out A_y. σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so A_y is (h/(4π)) times that. So the matrix is:
[[0, -(i h)/(4π)],
 [i h/(4π), 0]]

To find the eigenvalues, I'll set up the equation:

|A_y - λ I| = 0
Which is:
| (-λ)      -(i h)/(4π)      |
| (i h)/(4π)  (-λ)         | = 0

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h/(4π) ) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

So (√) λ² - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ] = 0.

Compute the second term. i times -i is -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So (h/(4π))^2 * (1 *1) = (h²)/(16 π²).

So determinant equation becomes λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0. Thus, λ² = h²/(16 π²), so λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation. The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ] = λ² - [ (i * -i) * (h/(4π))^2 ]

i*(-i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So yeah, (h/(4π))^2 * 1. So λ² = (h/(4π))^2 → λ= ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π). So looking at the options, the eigenvalues should have real parts ± h/(4π), but wait, the options mention the real and imaginary parts of a. Wait, but eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Are these purely real numbers? Because I'm computing the eigenvalues as real. Oh wait, no—wait, A_y is a real matrix? No, wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so when multiplied by c = h/(4π), the matrix is complex. So A_y is a complex matrix. Therefore, the eigenvalues could be complex.

Wait, but in this case, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian when multiplied by real constants. Wait, σ_y is Hermitian because its conjugate transpose is the same. Because σ_y† = σ_y. Let me check: σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements and take the complex conjugate. So the (1,2) element becomes i, and (2,1) becomes -i. Wait no, original is (1,2)= -i, (2,1) =i. So the conjugate transpose would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as the original only if i becomes -i. Hmm, no, so σ_y is Hermitian?

Wait σ_y is Hermitian because σ_y† = σ_y. Because (σ_y)^dagger is:

[ [0, i],
  [-i, 0] ]

Which is the same
