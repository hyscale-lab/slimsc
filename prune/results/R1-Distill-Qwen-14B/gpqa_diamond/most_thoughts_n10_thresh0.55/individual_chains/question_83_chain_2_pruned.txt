Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and determining the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm.

First, let me read the problem again. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Wait, so I need to find two pH values. One at 25% titration and the other at equivalence. Let's break it down.

First, let me think about the initial solution after dilution. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is CH3COOH, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Wait, no, 20 + 20 is 40 cm³ or 0.040 liters. Right.

So, the initial concentration after dilution can be calculated. The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity * Volume. Original M is 0.05 M, volume is 0.02 L (20 cm³). Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles, so the concentration becomes 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the initial concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait, no, wait. No, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, when you dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L = (0.001 mol) / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yeah, correct. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when you titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid initially.

So, moles of acetic acid initially is 0.001 mol (from before). So at equivalence, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³, right? So if I add 10 cm³ of NaOH, total volume at equivalence is 50 cm³.

But let's
