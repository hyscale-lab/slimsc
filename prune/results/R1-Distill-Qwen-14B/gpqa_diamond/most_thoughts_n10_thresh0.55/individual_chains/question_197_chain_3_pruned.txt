Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Alright, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (hydroiodic acid) cleavage reaction, which is used to cleave alkenes or maybe other unsaturated bonds.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. They gave me the IR and NMR data, so I should start by analyzing those.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but the strong peak around 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have strong carbonyl peaks around 1700 cm-1, maybe a bit higher if it's an ester or ketone? Wait, 1720 is more like an ester or possibly a ketone. But then there's a peak around 1610 cm-1, which is in the range of C=C stretching. Oh, that's probably from an aromatic ring. And 1450 cm-1 could be another aromatic ring mode or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, let me think. The 3400–2500 region is a broad peak, which could be an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid. Because if it were an alcohol, the peak would be less broad or maybe a single peak. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group. But then the 1720 cm-1 would fit with a carbonyl, like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids typically have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3300, yes. So that makes sense.

Now looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that’s a strong deshielded proton, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait no, wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and are split as a singlet. But in this case, it's a broad singlet. Hmm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, the broad
