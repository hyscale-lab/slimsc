Okay, so I've got this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when atoms are in different energy levels, their excitation depends on temperature and the energy difference between the levels. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. 

Wait, the term "excited" here probably refers to the population of a higher energy level. So, the ratio of the populations between two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of particles in two states is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by thermal energy (k*T).

The energy difference is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's interesting because 1.38 is close to the Boltzmann constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy ΔE is equal to k*T multiplied by some factor. Let me see. 

Wait, the energy difference between the energy levels is ΔE = E_upper - E_lower. The ratio of the populations N_upper / N_lower is equal to exp(-ΔE/(k T)). But wait, wait, in this case, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So I think that's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state or something. 

Wait, no, the problem says "twice as excited in a specific energy level". So perhaps that means the population of a certain excited state
