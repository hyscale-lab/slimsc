Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, what's the deal with these symmetries?

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let's break this down.

First, I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Because the SM itself is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT extends it. So any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. So symmetry 1 is a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations? Oh right, because Poincare includes the Lorentz group plus translations in spacetime. So if the theory is formulated in a way that's invariant under Poincare, then all operators should respect that too. But wait, how does this apply to SMEFT? SMEFT is often considered in the effective theory framework where the cutoff scale is high, and the theory is valid at low energies. So, does SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry?

I think SMEFT is built to respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model, except maybe for some beyond the SM physics that the operators are parametrizing. SM respects Poincare, so SMEFT should too. So symmetry 2 (Poincare) is also a must.

Wait, but sometimes I might confuse Poincare symmetry with Lorentz symmetry. Because P
