Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The reactions involve heating with KOH, then with aluminum isopropoxide, and then ozonolysis. Finally, the product is analyzed using NMR. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Let me start by thinking about each step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, forming an alkene. The product would be an adamantane derivative with a double bond where the two bromines were.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form 1,3-adamantadiene? Wait, no. Wait, let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four cyclohexane rings fused in a particular way. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. When they eliminate, they would form a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? Or wait, is 1,3-dibromoadamantane a vicinal dihalide? Hmm. Wait, no. Vicinal would be adjacent, like 1 and 2. 1 and 3 would be separated by a carbon. Oh wait, maybe it's a di-ortho dihalide in the adamantane structure. So when KOH is added, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, if both Br are on adjacent carbons, that's vicinal, but if they're on 1 and 3, that's not adjacent. Wait, maybe I need to draw the structure. But I'm a bit confused about the positions.

Wait, wait. The product after heating with KOH is a light yellow solid. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), around 2.4-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait
