Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. When the planet orbits, the star moves a bit, causing the spectral lines to shift periodically.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, same host star masses, same planet masses, same method used.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods. Wait, longer or shorter? Because the orbital period is how long the planet takes to orbit.

Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star. The shift in wavelength is related to the velocity. The formula I remember is the Doppler shift formula: v = (Δλ/λ0) * c, where Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ0 is the original wavelength, and c is the speed of light. But maybe I don't need the exact velocities; perhaps the ratio of the velocities can be found from the ratio of the shifts.

So, the shift for planet 1 is 5, planet 2 is 7. So the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the shift. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7. Wait, but the actual shift's relation to K is K = (v) = (λ shift)/(λ original) * c. But since the original wavelength λ0 is the same for both (same spectral line), maybe the ratio of K is 5/7.

But wait, K is the star's velocity due to the planet. The formula for K is given by K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) )^(1/1) ), but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P, given the same star and planet mass.

Wait, let me think. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ] * ( (2π / P ) )^(1/
