Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity. The shift is periodic and depends on the planet's mass and orbital characteristics.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, which is good because that makes the math easier.

So the key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method measures the Doppler shift. The formula for the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The maximum velocity (v) of the star is given by v = (G * M_p) / (M_star * a) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star)) )^(1/3), but wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relationship between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Alternatively, I think the RV shift is proportional to the planet's velocity, which depends on the semi-major axis and the orbital period. Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) c ) )

But since both planets have masses similar to Neptune and the stars are like the Sun, M_p << M_star. So M_p/M_star is negligible, so 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1. Also, since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so (1 - e²)^(1/2) = 1
