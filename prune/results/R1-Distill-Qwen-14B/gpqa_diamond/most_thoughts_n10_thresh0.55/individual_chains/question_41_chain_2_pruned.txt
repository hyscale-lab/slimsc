Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with moving media, it's not as straightforward as just combining velocities because light's speed in a medium depends on the medium's properties and the frame of reference.

So, the glass is moving towards the observer, right? And the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, how does this affect the speed of light?

I think the index of refraction n tells us the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but wait, c is the speed in a vacuum. Oh, but in this case, the glass is moving, so maybe we need to apply a velocity addition formula here.

Wait, I remember the relativistic velocity addition formula. It's different from the classical addition. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, is that applicable here?

Wait, no. Because u here would be the velocity of the light as seen from the glass's frame. Or maybe the other way around. Let me think.

In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. Because in the medium, the speed is lower. But then the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So we need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab's perspective, the light's speed would be... Hmm. Let me get the frames right.

Let me set up the reference frames. Let’s say the lab frame is S, and the glass's frame is S'. In S', the glass is stationary, and the light is moving at v_light = c/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity in the lab frame.

Wait, no. Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame (S). So in S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S, the light's speed is v_light' = c/n.

So to find the speed in the lab frame (S), we apply the relativistic velocity transformation. The formula is u
