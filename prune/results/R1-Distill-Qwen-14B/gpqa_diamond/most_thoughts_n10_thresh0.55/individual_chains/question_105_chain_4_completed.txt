Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the problem is about a star similar to the Sun, but with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The question is asking about the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation in the star's light curve as the spots do. The key is to find Rpl/Rstar, where Rpl is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

First, I need to understand what's causing the brightness variations. The star has dark spots covering 20% of one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The star's rotation causes these spots to come into and go out of view, which modulates the observed brightness—this is similar to how a planet transiting a star would block some light, causing a dip in brightness.

Wait, but the question is comparing the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet. So I need to model both scenarios and set their amplitude signals equal.

Let me break it down.

The star's radius is equal to the Sun's radius, let's denote that as Rstar = R_sun. The planet's radius is Rpl, which we're trying to find in terms of Rstar.

When a planet transits the star, it blocks some light. The change in brightness (delta F) is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I remember is delta F ≈ (Rpl/Rstar)^2. Because the area is πR², and the ratio of the areas is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Now, the star with spots. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the side facing us, the star appears dimmer. The variation depends on the size and temperature of the spots.

The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the filling factor is 0.2. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, the star's radius is Rstar, so the surface area is 4πRstar². A hemisphere would be 2πRstar². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

But each spot has a temperature difference. The star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

The brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view. Since the star is rotating, when the spots are on the near side (facing us), the brightness is lower. The change in flux (delta F_spot) would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4. The total flux from the star is F_total = σ T_eff^4 * (4π Rstar²) / (4π D²) ), where D is distance, but since we're dealing with relative changes, D will cancel out.

When the spots are on the hemisphere facing us, the effective flux is F_total - F_spots. The flux from the spots is the area of the spots times their emission. So F_spots = σ (T_spot^4) * A_spots.

So the change in flux (delta F_spot) when the spots are visible is F_total - (F_total - F_spots) = F_spots.

Wait, no. When the spots are on the far side, their flux isn't contributing, so the total flux is F_total. When the spots are on the front, their flux is lower. So the change is the difference between when the spots are on the front and when they're not.

Wait, perhaps I should model the flux when spots are on the near side and when they're not, then find the difference.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * 4π Rstar² / (4π D²) ) → simplifies to σ T^4 Rstar² / D².

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F1 = F0 - [σ (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) * (A_spots) ].

Wait, actually, each spot emits less flux. So the total flux is normally from the star, but when the spots are visible, the flux from those areas is less. So the change in flux is ΔF = F0 - F1 = σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) * A_spots / (4π D²) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the relative change. So the relative flux change (delta F / F0) is given by (F1 - F0) / F0 = - (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) * (A_spots) / (4π Rstar^2) )

Wait, A_spots is 0.2 * 2π Rstar², as earlier. So A_spots = 0.4 π Rstar².

So the relative change is:

(delta F / F0)_spot = [ (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) / (T_eff^4) ) ] * (A_spots / (4 π Rstar²) )

Wait, no. Let me think. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the front side, the flux we receive is less than F0. So the decrease in flux is the difference between the normal flux from those areas and the flux from the spots.

Each spot's area contributes F_spot = σ T_spot^4 * A_spot.

The normal flux from those areas would be σ T_eff^4 * A_spot. So the difference per spot is the area times (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) * σ.

So when the spots are on the front, the total flux is F0 - (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) * σ * A_spots / (4π D²).

Wait, but I think it's easier to compute the fractional change. So:

Fractional change due to spots:

ΔF_spot / F0 = [ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) * (A_spots) ] / (4 π Rstar²) * (σ / σ) ) → since F0 = σ T_eff^4 (4 π Rstar²) / (4 π D²) ), so F0 = σ T^4 Rstar² / D².

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let's calculate the relative change in flux when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us.

The change in flux (ΔF) is the difference between the flux when the spots are present and when they are not. When the spots are present, the flux from those regions is lower by (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) per unit area.

So, the total change in flux is:

ΔF = [ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ] * A_spots * σ

But the total flux when there are no spots is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * 4 π Rstar².

Wait, but the flux when the spots are on the near side is F = F0 - ΔF.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, maybe I should think in terms of relative flux.

The relative flux change is (ΔF / F0) = [ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) * A_spots ] / (4 π Rstar² * T_eff^4 )

Because F0 is σ T_eff^4 4 π Rstar² / (4 π D² ), but since we're taking the ratio, the (4 π D² ) cancels out. So,

ΔF / F0 = [ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) * A_spots ] / (4 π Rstar² T_eff^4 )

Wait, but A_spots is the area of the spots. Since the spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%, the area is 0.2 * 2 π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

So,

ΔF / F0 = [ (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) * 0.4 π Rstar² ] / [4 π Rstar² * 6000^4 ]

Simplify:

The Rstar² and π terms cancel out.

= [ (6000^4 -5000^4) * 0.4 ] / (4 * 6000^4 )

Let me compute 6000^4 and 5000^4.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 0.625e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So,

ΔF/F0 = (6.71e14) * 0.4 / (4 * 1.296e15 )

Compute numerator: 6.71e14 *0.4 = 2.684e14.

Denominator: 4 *1.296e15 = 5.184e15.

So,

ΔF/F0 = (2.684e14) / (5.184e15 ) = approximately 0.0517.

So about 5.17% relative change in flux.

Wait, but is this the amplitude of the variation? Because the star's brightness goes down when the spots are visible and up when they are not? Or is this the maximum dip?

Wait, no. When the spots are on the far side, their flux doesn't affect us, so the star appears brighter. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully on the front. So the amplitude of the variation is this ΔF/F0 of about 5.17%.

Wait, but the star is only covering one hemisphere, so the spots are only on one side. So when the star rotates, the spots go from being on the front to the back, causing the brightness to dip and then rise again. So the variation amplitude is this 5.17% dip.

Now, the planet scenario: when the planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in flux is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, because the planet's area is (Rpl)^2 over the star's area (Rstar)^2, and since flux is proportional to area.

So to have the same amplitude as the spot scenario, the planet's flux change should be equal to 5.17%.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517.

Taking the square root,

Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

Wait, that's approximately 0.227, which is about 0.23. But looking at the options, let me check:

Options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none of the options is about 0.23. Did I make a mistake?

Wait a second, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ΔF/F0.

Let me recalculate the ΔF/F0.

We have T_eff = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K.

Compute (6000^4 -5000^4) = ?

Let me compute 6000^4:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So the difference is 1.296e15 - 0.625e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So,

ΔF/F0 = [ (6.71e14) * 0.4 ] / [4 * 1.296e15 ]

Let me compute numerator: 6.71e14 * 0.4 = 2.684e14.

Denominator:4 * 1.296e15 = 5.184e15.

So 2.684e14 / 5.184e15 = 2.684 /51.84 ≈ 0.0517, so 5.17%.

So the ΔF/F0 is about 5.17%.

So, for the planet,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

So approximately 0.23.

But none of the options is exactly 0.23. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the relative calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots go from being on the near side to the far side. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully on the front, but the overall variation in brightness due to rotation would have a certain amplitude.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variations more accurately. The star's brightness will vary as the spots rotate into and out of view. The maximum dip is when the spots are fully on the front. The variation from the minimum to maximum is 2*(ΔF/2F0), but wait, perhaps I should model the light curve.

Wait, the maximum dip is when all the spots are facing us, and the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible. So the amplitude is the dip, which is ΔF/F0 ≈5.17%.

But let's think about the planet transit. The planet will block a certain area, leading to a dip in flux of (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So, the dip from the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but in the case of the spots, the dip is 5.17% (0.0517), so the planet's dip must be the same.

So, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the spot calculation.

Wait, perhaps I missed the fact that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, only a portion of the spots are visible at any time. Wait, no. The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view as a whole. So the maximum dip is when all the spots are visible.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the rotation period causing the spots to come into view. But the problem says that the observed variation is equivalent to the planet's transit, so we're comparing the maximum dip, not the averaged effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the spot-induced brightness variation is due to the spots being cooler, but when they are on the far side, the star appears brighter than when they are on the near side. So the total variation in brightness would be from when the spots are not visible (bright) to when they are visible (darker). So the amplitude is twice the dip I calculated earlier.

Wait, no, because when the spots are not visible (on the far side), the flux is F0. When the spots are visible on the front, the flux is F0 - ΔF. So the amplitude is the difference between F0 and F0 - ΔF, which is ΔF. So the amplitude is ΔF.

So the dip is ΔF, which is the same as the planet's dip.

So, perhaps my calculation is correct, but the options don't match. Alternatively, maybe the approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's spots are causing a variation that is similar to the planet's transit, but in the case of the star, the effect is a dip and then a rise (since when the spots are on the far side, the star is brighter than normal). Wait, no, because when the spots are on the far side, what's the effect? The spots are cooler, so when they're not visible, the star's flux is higher than when they're visible.

So when the star is at a certain rotational phase, the spots are on the far side, so the star's flux is F0. When they're on the near side, the flux is F0 - ΔF.

Wait, no. That's not correct. Because when the spots are on the far side, the flux is the same as when there are no spots because the spots are not contributing less. Wait, no. The star emits more flux when the spots are not visible because the spots are cooler. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. The star without any spots emits F0. When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F0 minus the amount that the spots are cooler. So the flux is (F0) * [( (T_eff^4 * (Astar - A_spots) ) + (T_spot^4 * A_spots ) ) / (T_eff^4 * Astar) ) ]

Wait, that's getting complicated, but perhaps a better approach is to model the flux as:

Flux = F0 * (1 - (A_spots/(4π Rstar²)) ) + (F0) * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) * (A_spots/(4π Rstar²)) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express the flux when the spots are visible as F = F0 * ( (Astar - A_spots) * T_eff^4 + A_spots * T_spot^4 ) / ( Astar * T_eff^4 )

Since Astar is 4π Rstar², A_spots is 0.4 π Rstar².

So,

F = F0 * [ (4π Rstar² - 0.4 π Rstar²) * T_eff^4 + 0.4 π Rstar² T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 π Rstar² T_eff^4 )

Simplify numerator:

(3.6 π Rstar² ) T_eff^4 + 0.4 π Rstar² T_spot^4.

So,

F = F0 * [ 3.6 T_eff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ] / (4 T_eff^4 )

= F0 * [ (3.6 T_eff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) / (4 T_eff^4) ]

= F0 * [ 0.9 + (0.4 /4 ) (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ]

= F0 * [ 0.9 + 0.1 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ]

So,

F = F0 * [ 0.9 + 0.1 ( (5000/6000)^4 ) ]

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

(5/6) = 0.8333... → (5/6)^2 ≈ 0.6944 → (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.6944² ≈ 0.48225.

So,

0.1 * 0.48225 ≈ 0.048225.

So,

F = F0 * [ 0.9 + 0.048225 ] = F0 * 0.948225.

So the flux when the spots are visible is 0.948225 F0.

When the spots are not visible (on the far side), the flux is F0.

So the maximum dip is F0 - 0.948225 F0 = 0.051775 F0, which is about 5.1775% dip.

That's about 5.18% dip, which matches the earlier calculation.

So the amplitude is 5.18% dip.

Now, the planet transiting causes a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276.

So approximately 0.228.

But the options given are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, none of these are close to 0.23. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the change in flux when the spots are on the near side and the far side, leading to a variation of 2*(ΔF/2F0) ?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The maximum dip is 5.17% when the spots are fully on the front. The maximum brightness is F0, when the spots are on the back. So the star's brightness varies between F0 and 0.948225 F0. The amplitude of the variation is 0.051775 F0, which is a 5.1775% dip.

So for the planet, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is phrased differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the dip but the variation's amplitude. Oh wait, perhaps the way the star's brightness varies is that when the spots are on the near side, the brightness is lower, and when they're on the far side, the brightness is higher than the average. So the total variation would be from F0 (when spots are on the far side) to F0 - ΔF (spots on the near side). So the peak-to-peak variation is ΔF. But in terms of the amplitude, which is half the peak-to-peak, it's ΔF/2.

Wait, no. The amplitude is generally the maximum change from the mean. So when the star is at maximum brightness (spots not visible), it's F0. At minimum, it's F_min = F0 - ΔF. So the amplitude is the difference between F0 and F_min, which is ΔF.

So the amplitude is 5.1775% of F0.

So the planet's transit would have the same amplitude when (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I did something wrong earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area. Let me double-check.

The problem states that one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the area covered is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

The hemisphere area is 2 π Rstar².

So the spot area is 0.2 * 2 π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to rotate in and out of view, but the brightness variation isn't a simple dip. Maybe the modulation is more complex. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps they model it as a simple dip.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the spot effect leads to a brightness variation that is the same as the planet's transit, but the star is only half spotted. So perhaps the effective area is 0.2 * (π Rstar²) because it's one hemisphere, not two.

Wait, no, the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * 2 π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar², which is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the change in flux as the spots rotate, leading to a variation that's sinusoidal. The amplitude of the brightness variation would then be ΔF, which we've calculated as 5.17% F0. So the planet's transit would need to cause the same 5.17% dip.

Wait, but again, none of the options match 0.227.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options. The closest option is option D, which is ~0.32. Let me compute (0.32)^2 = 0.1024, which is about 10% dip. But our calculation is about 5%. So that's not close. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ΔF calculation. Let me recalculate the (ΔF / F0) more accurately.

Compute (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So,

(6000^4 -5000^4) = 1.296e15 - 0.625e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So,

(T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) / T_eff^4 = 6.71e14 / 1.296e15 = 0.517.

Then,

ΔF/F0 = [0.517] * [0.4 π Rstar² ] / [4 π Rstar² ]

The π Rstar² cancels, so,

= 0.517 * 0.4 /4 = 0.517 * 0.1 = 0.0517 → 5.17%.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's rotation leads to the spots being only partially visible at any time. No, because the problem states that the entire hemisphere is covered, so when the star rotates, the entire spot area comes into view.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on one side, so when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots would rotate in and out, but the maximum dip would still be when the entire spot area is in front.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the area. Let me think again.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4 π Rstar². One hemisphere is 2 π Rstar². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2 π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar². So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the star's brightness variation is more than just the spot's effect because the spots are cooler, which affects the overall emission. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the problem differently, considering that the spots make the star appear dimmer when they are on the front, and brighter when on the back, leading to a larger variation.

Wait, no. The star's flux when spots are on the front is lower, and when they're on the back, the flux is higher than the average. So the amplitude is the difference between F0 and F_min. But in reality, the F_max is F0 (when no spots are visible), and F_min is when all spots are visible.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that when the spots are on the back, the star appears brighter than F0. So the star's brightness varies between F0 (when spots are not visible) and F0 + ΔF when the spots are on the back.

Wait, no. Because the spots are cooler, when they are on the back, they are not emitting less, so the star's flux is F0. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the star's total flux and the flux we observe.

Wait, when the spots are on the side facing us, their lower emission reduces the total observed flux. When the spots are on the far side, their lower emission doesn't affect us, so the flux is F0. So the maximum flux is F0, and the minimum is when the spots are fully visible.

So the variation is F0 - F_min = ΔF = 5.17%.

So the amplitude is 5.17% of F0.

Thus, the planet's transit must cause a dip of the same 5.17%.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the effect of the spot's rotation, leading to a sinusoidal variation with amplitude A. So perhaps the maximum dip is A, but the average is zero. So the peak-to-peak is 2A, but the amplitude (as a percentage of the mean) is A.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude is the maximum change from the mean. So when the spots are on the front, the flux is F0 - ΔF, and on the back, F0. So the mean flux is (F0 + (F0 - ΔF )) / 2 = F0 - ΔF/2.

The amplitude would then be the maximum deviation from the mean, which is ΔF/2.

Wait, this would mean the amplitude is 5.17% / 2 ≈ 2.585%.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.02585 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.1608.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation as the difference between when all spots are visible and when none are. So the amplitude is 5.17%, which is the same as the dip from the planet.

But perhaps the planet's transit isn't the same as the spot's dip. Because the planet is a transiting object, but the spots are a rotational feature.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's effect as a periodic brightening and dimming. When the spots are on the near side, flux is lower, and when they're on the far side, it's higher than the mean, leading to a variation that includes a bright peak and a dim dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's observed flux varies sinusoidally as the spots rotate, leading to a maximum and a minimum. The amplitude would be half the peak-to-peak variation.

Wait, let's compute that.

The peak-to-peak variation is (F_max - F_min) = F0 - (F0 - ΔF) ) = ΔF = 5.17% F0.

So the amplitude (half of peak-to-peak) is 2.585% F0.

So to have the same amplitude as the planet's transit, the planet's dip would need to be 2.585% F0.

Thus,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.02585 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.1608.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute the dip from the spots more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not just one hemisphere. But the question states that only one hemisphere is spotty, so the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the spots as causing a dip of (filling factor) * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4).

Wait, the filling factor is 0.2, and the ratio is (5000/6000)^4.

So ΔF/F0 = 0.2 * (5000/6000)^4.

Compute that: 0.2 * (5/6)^4.

(5/6)^4 = (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 0.2 * 0.48225 ≈ 0.09645. So about 9.645% dip.

Wait, that's different from the earlier calculation. But why?

Because I'm not considering the area correctly. If the filling factor is 20% for the entire star, then the area is 0.2 * 4 π Rstar² = 0.8 π Rstar².

But the question says that one hemisphere is covered, so the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * 2 π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

But if the problem mistakenly considers the filling factor as 20% of the entire star, then the area would be larger, leading to a larger dip.

But according to the problem statement, it's one hemisphere, so I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the star is viewed from Earth, only a portion of the spots is visible at any time. For example, if the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, only a portion is visible. But that's not the case because the problem states that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the entire spot area comes into view.

So perhaps the correct value is 5.17%, but none of the options match. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot's area. Let me re-calculate the spot's area contribution.

The spot's area is 0.2 (filling factor) * 2 π Rstar² (hemisphere area) = 0.4 π Rstar².

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 π Rstar²) / (4 π Rstar²) ) = 0.1 → 10%. So the total area is 10% of the star's surface.

So the relative change in flux when the spots are on the front is:

ΔF = F0 * (1 - (fraction of spots) * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) )

Wait, that's another approach. The total flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 * (1 - f * ( (T_spot^4) / T_eff^4 )) )

where f is the filling factor (0.2 for the hemisphere, which is 0.1 for the whole star).

Wait, no. Because the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere, which is 10% of the entire star's surface.

So f = 0.1.

So,

ΔF/F0 = f * ( T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )

Wait, no. That's if the spots are cooler. So when the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - f (1 - T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) )

Because each spot contributes (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) of the flux in that area.

So the change in flux is F = F0 * [ 1 - f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ]

= F0 * [ 1 - f + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ]

But the change in flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 * (1 - f + f * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) )

So the relative change is (F - F0) / F0 = -f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Which is,

ΔF/F0 = -f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) )

The magnitude is f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

So in our case, f is 0.1 (since 20% of the hemisphere is 10% of the entire surface).

So,

ΔF/F0 = 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (0.8333)^4 )

As before, (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So,

ΔF/F0 = 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225 ) = 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775 → 5.1775%.

So same as before.

So the planet's transit must cause a dip of 5.1775% to match.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276.

So approximately 0.228 Rstar.

But the options given don't include this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a different approach. For example, perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to the spots blocking light, similar to the planet, but the spots are cooler, so their effect is a dip but not a complete block. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's total flux when the spots are on the front and back, leading to a different calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet's radius to produce the same relative change in flux as the spots, but in the opposite way—causing the same amplitude in the brightness curve, regardless of being a dip or a rise.

Wait, but the planet blocks light, causing a dip, while the spots cause a dip when on the front and a rise when on the back. So perhaps the variation caused by the spots is a combination of both.

Wait, perhaps the maximum brightness is when the spots are on the back, and the minimum when on the front. So the amplitude would be the difference between maximum and minimum divided by the average.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/ (F_max + F_min)/2 ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation as a function of the spot's rotation, leading to a sinusoidal light curve with a certain amplitude.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is given by:

A_spot = (F0 - F_spot) / F0 → 5.17%.

And the planet's transit amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So to have the same amplitude, the planet's (Rpl/Rstar)^2 must equal 0.0517 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

But again, no option matches this.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me list them:

A) ~0.39 → (0.39)^2= ~0.15 → 15% dip.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → 0.49% dip.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 → ~1.21% dip.

D) ~0.32 → 0.1024 → ~10.24% dip.

Hmm, none of these match the 5.17% dip I calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation not as a dip but as a modulation due to the spots rotating. So perhaps the variation is a sinusoidal function with amplitude A, which is the maximum change in flux.

Wait, if the star's brightness varies sinusoidally with an amplitude of 5.17% of F0, then the planet's transit would need to cause a dip of the same amplitude.

But again, that leads to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as a combination of the spot's effect and the star's rotation, leading to a different calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the star's brightness variation due to spots is the same as the star's brightness variation due to the planet's transit, but in the absence of spots, the planet's effect is that dip. So the question is, what planet radius Rpl would cause the same dip as the spots do.

Wait, yes, that's what the question says: 'To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!) what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?'

So the spot's effect is causing a dip of 5.17% F0. The planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 F0.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

But again, this isn't an option. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when the spots are on the far side, the star's brightness is higher than normal because the spots are not reducing the flux. So the maximum brightness is F0, and the minimum is F0 - ΔF. The amplitude is the difference between F0 and F_min, which is ΔF.

So the planet's transit must cause the same ΔF.

But in that case, the calculation remains the same, leading to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

Since none of the options match, perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as a factor that increases the star's brightness when they're on the back. So the maximum brightness is F0, and the minimum is F0 - ΔF. But when the spots are on the back, the brightness is F0 + ΔF (since the spots are cooler and not contributing), but no, that doesn't make sense because the spots are areas of lower emission. When they are on the far side, their lower emission doesn't affect us, so the flux remains F0.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here because the correct answer isn't among the options. But perhaps I should reevaluate the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation as a function of the spot's rotation, leading to a variation amplitude that is the product of the spot's area and temperature difference, but in a different way.

Let me think again: the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots is given by the change in flux when the spots rotate into and out of view.

The amplitude is the difference between when the spots are on the front (lower flux) and when they're on the back (normal flux).

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is ΔF = F0 - F1 = F0 - [F0 * (1 - f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)) ) ]

= F0 * f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Which is the same as before: 5.17% F0.

So the planet's transit would need to have a dip of 5.17% F0.

Thus,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So, if the planet's signal is the same as the spot's dip of 5.17%, then Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct option is not listed, but perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's effect as a brightening when on the far side. So the maximum brightness is F0 + ΔF, and the minimum is F0 - ΔF. So the peak-to-peak variation is 2 ΔF, and the amplitude (half of that) is ΔF.

Wait, but the amplitude would then be the same as before, 5.17% F0.

But again, the same conclusion.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's effect as a variation in brightness that is an increase when the spots are on the far side, leading to a higher amplitude.

Wait, no. Because when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F0. When on the near side, it's F0 - ΔF.

So the peak-to-peak is F0 - (F0 - ΔF) = ΔF, which is 5.17% F0.

So the planet's transit would cause a dip of the same ΔF.

Thus, I'm confident that the correct Rpl/Rstar is approximately 0.227.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake, or the options are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement.

The problem states that the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So Teff is 6000 K, spots are 5000 K. Did I compute that correctly? Yes.

The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. Correct.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the (5000/6000)^4.

5000 /6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.833333.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So, 0.482253.

So,

f is 0.1 (10% of the star's surface).

So,

0.1 * (1 - 0.482253) = 0.1 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.0517747 → 5.177% dip.

Yes, correct.

So, Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but that would give a dip of about 1.2%, which is much smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the spots to have a filling factor of 20% of the entire star, leading to a larger dip.

If the filling factor is 20% of the entire star (f=0.2), then:

ΔF/F0 = 0.2 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) = 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355 → 10.355% dip.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Ah, that makes sense. So perhaps the problem intended f to be 0.2 of the entire star, not a hemisphere.

In that case, the answer would be option D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation in the star's light curve as the dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Planet Properties**:
   - The planet's radius \( R_{\text{pl}} \) is to be determined relative to \( R_{\text{star}} \), i.e., \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \).

3. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness variation due to the spots is caused by the rotational modulation of the cooler spots coming into and out of view.
   - The planet's brightness variation is caused by the planet blocking part of the star's light during transit, proportional to the area ratio \( (R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 \).

### Analysis:
#### Step 1: Brightness Variation Due to Spots
The filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere, so the area of the spots is:
\[
A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
\]
The fractional change in flux when the spots are on the near side is:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{(T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4) \cdot A_{\text{spots}}}{T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2}.
\]
Substituting \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), and \( A_{\text{spots}} = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \):
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{(6000^4 - 5000^4) \cdot 0.4}{4 \cdot 6000^4}.
\]
Calculating \( 6000^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} \) and \( 5000^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14} \), we find:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{(1.296 \times 10^{15} - 6.25 \times 10^{14}) \cdot 0.4}{4 \cdot 1.296 \times 10^{15}} = 0.051775 \, \text{(or 5.1775%)}.
\]

#### Step 2: Brightness Variation Due to the Planet
The planet's transit causes a dip in brightness proportional to the area ratio:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \frac{\Delta F}{F_0}.
\]
Substituting \( \Delta F / F_0 = 0.051775 \):
\[
\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2276.
\]

### Comparison with Options
The calculated value \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.2276 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the filling factor is interpreted as 20% of the entire star (instead of one hemisphere), the area of the spots becomes:
\[
A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.8 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
\]
Recomputing the fractional change in flux:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{(6000^4 - 5000^4) \cdot 0.8}{4 \cdot 6000^4} = 0.10355 \, \text{(or 10.355%)}.
\]
For the planet:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
\]
This matches option **D (~0.32)**.

### Conclusion
The most consistent answer with the given options is **D (~0.32)**, assuming the filling factor applies to the entire star rather than one hemisphere.
