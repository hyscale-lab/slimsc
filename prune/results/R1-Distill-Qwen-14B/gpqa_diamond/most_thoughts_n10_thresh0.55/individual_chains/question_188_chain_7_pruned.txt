Okay, so I have this question about a rhombohedral crystal and finding the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance (d) for a given plane (hkl) can be calculated using a formula involving the lattice constants and the angles of the crystal. Oh wait, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... something with the angles maybe? Or wait, no, maybe it's for a cubic system. This is a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of hexagonal system, I think, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, rhombohedral means all edges are equal and all angles are equal, right? So in that case, a = b = c, and α = β = γ. So in this problem, a = 10 Å, and all angles are 30 degrees.

So the formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal system is d = (a² (b² c²))^(1/2) ) / ( sqrt( h² a² + k² b² + l² c² - 2 h k a b cos γ + ... other terms for other angles ... )) ? No, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Alternatively, I think for a rhombohedral system, the formula simplifies because a = b = c = a0, and the angles are all the same. So the formula for d might be
