Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And a resonance probably refers to a particle that doesn't exist for very long before decaying. 

The question gives me some specific values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so it's a very small distance.

I think the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime. Oh wait, the decay distance should be the velocity multiplied by the lifetime, right? Because distance equals speed multiplied by time. So I need to find the lifetime of the meson X first.

I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. 

But wait, I also need to calculate the velocity of the meson. Velocity depends on the energy and mass. I think I can use the energy-momentum relation to find the momentum, and then get velocity from that.

So the production energy E is given as 8 GeV. Since it's a resonance, I think the mass is around 1.2 GeV, so E is much higher than the mass. Therefore, the meson is probably moving relativistically. 

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The momentum p is γ m v, and since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, maybe I can solve for p. 

Let me write down the equations. Let's use natural units where c=1 to make calculations easier, but I'll need to convert back to SI units eventually.

E² = p² + m². So p = sqrt(E² - m²). Plugging in the numbers: E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So p² = 8² - 1.2² = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p is sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

Wait, but GeV is a unit of energy, so when I'm calculating momentum, I need to remember to convert it into kg·m/s. Hmm, perhaps I should handle the units more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of mass, energy, and then find velocity.

Wait, another approach: the velocity can be found using β = v/c = p c / E. Because p c is the momentum times c, so p c = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) when using E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. 

So β = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)) * c / c )? Wait, maybe I should write it as β = p c / E. Since E is the total energy, which is γ m c², and p is γ m v, so p c = γ m v c. 

So β = (p c) / E = (γ m v c) / (γ m c²) ) = v / c. So yes, β = (p c)/E. 

So from that, I can compute β. Once I have β, velocity is β c.

Let me compute that. So first, p c is the momentum multiplied by c. But since E is in GeV and m as well, perhaps I should convert them to SI units. Wait, maybe it's easier if I use the formula in terms of E and m.

Alternatively, because in natural units (where c=1 and ħ=1), calculations are easier, and then we can convert the units at the end.

Wait, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², and energy E_X is 8 GeV. So in natural units, E = 8 GeV, m =1.2 GeV/c². So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV/c ≈ sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

Wait, but units are getting a bit confusing. Let's think in natural units where c=1. So E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², but with c=1, m is GeV. So p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV.

Then, beta is (p c)/(E). Wait, but since in natural units, c is 1, so beta = p/E. So beta ≈7.91 /8 ≈0.98875. So v ≈0.98875 c.

So the velocity is roughly 0.98875 times the speed of light. That's very fast.

Now, about the lifetime τ. As I thought earlier, Γ is the width which is related to the lifetime by Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But Γ is given as 320 MeV. Hmm, I need to convert this into units of energy, and then find τ in seconds.

Wait, ħ has units of GeV·s, because when you multiply ħ (GeV·s) by Γ (GeV), you get ħ Γ in GeV²·s, but that doesn't make sense... Wait, no, the formula is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. So units-wise: ħ is in J·s, but since we're using GeV, let's find ħ in GeV·s.

I remember that ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Let me check that. Yeah, because 1 GeV ≈ 1.602e-10 J, and ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So in GeV·s, that's (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) ) ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So ħ ≈6.582e-25 GeV s.

Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. 

Now, the decay distance is the velocity times the lifetime. So d = v τ.

v is 0.98875 c, so approximately 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So d = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s ≈ 6.102e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see a 6e-16 m. The options are around 4e-15 or 5e-15, or 4e-16,5e-16.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let's recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me compute that again.

p = sqrt(E² - m²) where E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. So p = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV/c. 

Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so p is 7.91 GeV. Then, beta is p c / E. Wait, but wait, in natural units, c=1, so p is in GeV/c. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula beta = (p c)/(E). Because in units where c isn't 1, p is in kg m/s, E in joules. So beta = (p c^2)/(E c) )= (p c)/(E).

Wait, to get beta, which is v/c, I can use beta = (p c^2) / (E c) )= (p c ) / E. 

But wait, in natural units, that's just p/E, as before. So beta is p/(E) * c. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with units.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute beta using beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So, let's compute beta squared.

Beta squared is 1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2). 

Given that E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c^2.

Let me compute (m c^2) = 1.2 GeV, so (m c^2)^2 = 1.44 GeV^2.

E^2 is 64 GeV^2.

So (m c^2)^2 / E^2 = 1.44 /64 = 0.0225.

So beta squared is 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, same as before.

So beta is approximately 0.9887, so v≈0.9887 c.

So v is about 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the lifetime tau is 2.056e-24 seconds.

So decay distance d = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s ≈ 6.102e-16 meters.

But the options are A) 5.0223e-16 m, B) 4.06e-15, C)5.02e-15, D)4.06e-16.

Hmm, none of them match exactly. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of tau.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / Gamma.

But I used ħ as 6.582e-25 GeV s.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So tau is 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 s.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of velocity. Let me compute it more accurately.

Beta is 0.9887, so v is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s.

3e8 is 300,000,000 m/s. 0.9887 * 3e8 = 296,610,000 m/s.

So 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau (2.056e-24 s):

2.9661e8 * 2.056e-24 = ?

Let me compute 2.9661e8 * 2.056e-24.

2.9661e8 is 2.9661 * 1e8.

2.056e-24 is 2.056 * 1e-24.

Multiply them together: 2.9661 * 2.056 = approximately 6.10.

So 6.10 * 1e8 *1e-24 = 6.10e-16 meters.

Hmm, that's 6.1e-16 m. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should use the total decay width Γ to compute the mean lifetime. Oh, but I think I did that correctly. Tau is ħ/(Γ). 

Alternatively, perhaps the production energy isn't the same as the meson's energy. Wait, no, the production energy is E_X, which is the energy of the meson. So I think that's correct.

Wait, let's think about the calculation of momentum again. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula for the velocity.

Wait another approach: The total energy E is given by E = gamma m c^2.

The momentum p is gamma m v.

So gamma = E/(m c^2). 

So p = (E/(m c^2)) * m v = E v/(c^2).

Beta is v/c, so beta = (p c^2)/E.

Wait, same as before. So perhaps that's the same result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the momentum in proper SI units.

Let me try that.

E =8 GeV = 8e9 eV.

m =1.2 GeV/c² = 1.2e9 eV/c².

Convert everything to joules.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E =8e9 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV = 8e9 *1.602e-19 = 1.2816e-10 J.

m =1.2e9 eV/c² * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / (c²) → 1.2e9 *1.602e-19 / (9e16) ) → because c^2 is approx (3e8 m/s)^2=9e16 m²/s².

So m = 1.2e9 * 1.602e-19 /9e16.

Calculate numerator: 1.2e9 * 1.602e-19 = 1.9224e-10.

Divide by 9e16: 1.9224e-10 /9e16 = 2.136e-27 kg.

So m = ~2.136e-27 kg.

Now, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

Compute E^2: (1.2816e-10 J)^2 ≈ 1.6425e-20 J^2.

(m c^2)^2: m c² is (2.136e-27 kg) * (9e16 m²/s²) ) = 2.136e-27 * 9e16 = 1.9224e-10 J.

So (m c²)^2 = (1.9224e-10)^2 = 3.697e-20 J².

So (pc)^2 = 1.6425e-20 -3.697e-20 = -2.0545e-20. Wait, that's a negative number, which can't be right. That doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in units?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck.

E is 8 GeV =8e9 eV. 1 eV=1.602e-19 J. So E=8e9 * 1.602e-19 = 1.2816e-10 J. That's correct.

m is 1.2 GeV/c². 1 GeV/c² = (1.602e-10 J)/(9e16 m²/s²) = 1.602e-10 /9e16 = 1.78e-27 kg.

So m is 1.2 *1.78e-27 = 2.136e-27 kg. Correct.

m c² = 2.136e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 2.136e-27 * 9e16 = 1.9224e-10 J. Correct.

E² = (1.2816e-10)^2 = 1.6425e-20 J².

(mc²)^2 = (1.9224e-10)^2 = 3.697e-20 J².

So (pc)^2 = 1.6425e-20 -3.697e-20 = -2.0545e-20 → negative. That can't be right. Hmm, that's impossible because E must be larger than mc² for a real particle.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the meson is a resonance, so perhaps it's off-shell? Or perhaps I'm using the wrong E.

Wait, the problem states that X is a meson resonance, so perhaps the energy E is its center of mass energy, but in any case, E should be greater than the mass. Because 8 GeV is much larger than 1.2 GeV, so E^2 should be greater than (mc^2)^2. So why am I getting a negative number?

Ah, I think I messed up the exponents somewhere.

Wait, let me recompute E and m.

E=8 GeV = 8e9 eV.

Each eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E=8e9 * 1.602e-19 = 1.2816e-10 J.

m =1.2 GeV/c² =1.2e9 eV/c².

Each eV/c² is (1.602e-19 J) / (9e16 m²/s²) ) = 1.602e-19 /9e16 = approx 1.78e-36 J m²/s² → Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait, no, kg is the unit for mass. So perhaps I should calculate m in kg correctly.

mass m = 1.2 GeV/c² → 1 GeV/c² is (1e9 eV) / (c²) → converting eV to J.

So 1 GeV = 1e9 eV = 1.602e-10 J.

So 1 GeV/c² = (1.602e-10 J) / (9e16 m²/s²) ) → 1.602e-10 /9e16 = 1.78e-27 kg.

So m=1.2 GeV/c²=1.2 *1.78e-27 kg = 2.136e-27 kg. Correct.

Then, (m c²) = 2.136e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 2.136e-27 * 9e16 = 1.9224e-10 J. Correct.

So E^2 = (1.2816e-10)^2 = 1.6425e-20 (J)^2.

(mc²)^2= (1.9224e-10)^2 = 3.697e-20 (J)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = 1.6425e-20 -3.697e-20 = -2.0545e-20 J².

Wait, that's negative. How can that be? That can't be right. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, wait a second. I think I messed up the calculation of (pc). Because E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So if E is 8 GeV, which is much larger than m c^2 (1.2 GeV), then (pc)^2 must be positive. So why am I getting a negative number?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents when converting GeV to J.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. Each eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J. So 8 GeV is 8 *1.602e-10 J =1.2816e-9 J. Wait, did I mess up the exponent here?

Wait, 8e9 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV =8e9 *1.602e-19 = (8 *1.602) *1e-10 =12.816e-10 =1.2816e-9 J. Oh! I see my mistake. Earlier, I thought E was 1.2816e-10 J, but it's actually 1.2816e-9 J. I messed up the exponent by a factor of 10.

So E^2 is (1.2816e-9 J)^2 = 1.6425e-18 J².

(mc^2)^2 is (1.9224e-10 J)^2 =3.697e-20 J².

So (pc)^2 = 1.6425e-18 -3.697e-20 = (1.6425e-18 - 0.03697e-18 ) = 1.6055e-18 J².

So pc = sqrt(1.6055e-18) = approx 4.0069e-9 J s/m.

Wait, because J = kg m²/s², so J s/m = kg m/(s).

So p = (4.0069e-9 J s/m) / c.

Wait, but c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = 4.0069e-9 / (3e8) )= approx 1.3356e-17 kg m/s.

Wait, but maybe I don't need the actual momentum. Let me get back to beta.

Beta = v/c = (p c^2) / (E c).

Wait, maybe it's better to use beta = (p c^2) / (E c) )= (p c)/(E).

Wait, using the same unit system, let me compute p c in J s/m.

p c = (4.0069e-9 J s/m) * 3e8 m/s = 1.202e-0 J s/m * m/s = 1.202e-0 J s^{-1}.

Wait, but E is 1.2816e-9 J.

So beta = (p c)/(E) = (1.202e-0 J s^{-1}) / (1.2816e-9 J) )= 1.202e-0 / 1.2816e-9 ≈ 9.38e8.

Wait, that's greater than 1, which is impossible for beta.

Hmm, that can't be right. So this approach might not be correct. Maybe I should use the relativistic relation for beta.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Let me compute beta using the formula:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

As I did earlier, but with correct units.

E is 8 GeV =8e9 eV.

m c²=1.2 GeV=1.2e9 eV.

So (m c^2)^2 = (1.2e9)^2 = 1.44e18 (eV)^2.

E^2 = (8e9)^2 =64e18 (eV)^2.

So (m c^2)^2 /E^2 =1.44e18 /64e18 = 0.0225.

So beta squared =1 -0.0225=0.9775. So beta= sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.

So same as before. So that's correct. So no mistake there.

So, I think my initial calculation was correct, but the problem is with the decay distance not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = ħ / Gamma.

But ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV s. So tau =6.582e-25 / 0.32 =2.056875e-24 s.

So that's correct. So d= v tau =0.9887 c * 2.056875e-24 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So d=0.9887 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

0.9887 *3e8 =2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = approx 6.102e-16 m.

But the options are A)5.02e-16, B)4.06e-15, C)5.02e-15, D)4.06e-16.

Hmm, none match. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the production energy is not the total energy of the meson. Maybe it's the center-of-mass energy, so the meson is produced at rest? No, that can't be right because the production energy is given as 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the meson must be moving with high energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mean lifetime as 1/(Gamma) in natural units, but that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic effects on the width. The total decay width is given in the rest frame, but when the particle is moving, the observed width changes. Hmm, but the mean lifetime is in the particle's rest frame. So perhaps the decay width used is the same as the natural width, so my calculation is correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the velocity.

Another approach: Using the relativistic relation for velocity.

gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV)/(1.2 GeV) )= 6.6667.

So gamma is about 6.6667.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) → beta^2 = 1 - (1/gamma^2) =1 -1/(44.444) =1 -0.0225=0.9775.

So same as before. beta is 0.9887.

So v=0.9887 c.

So v=0.9887 *3e8 m/s=2.966e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056e-24 s.

d= v * tau =2.966e8 * 2.056e-24 =6.102e-16 m.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So maybe I should recheck the tau calculation.

Wait, another possible mistake: Gamma is given in MeV, I used it as GeV. Let me see: Gamma is 320 MeV=0.32 GeV. So yes, correct.

Wait, wait, perhaps the decay width is not in GeV, but in MeV. So 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So my calculation of tau is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Let me think of another way to calculate the decay length.

Wait, another formula: The decay length can be approximated by L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Because, in the lab frame, the particle travels a distance L = v tau = beta c tau. 

Beta gamma is (v/c) gamma, and gamma is E/(m c²).

So L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, because tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So decay length is v * (gamma tau) = beta c * gamma tau.

But wait, that would be L= beta gamma c tau.

Hmm, perhaps I should use that formula instead.

So let's compute beta gamma.

Gamma is E/(m c²)=8 GeV /1.2 GeV= 6.6667.

Beta is 0.9887.

So beta gamma= 0.9887 *6.6667 ≈6.6.

So L= beta gamma c tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056e-24 s.

So L=6.6 *3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s.

Let me compute that.

6.6 *3e8 =1.98e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056e-24 s: 1.98e9 *2.056e-24= 4.06e-15 meters.

Ah! That's option B:4.0655e-15 m, or option C is 5.02e-15.

Wait, 4.06e-15 is option B. So the correct answer should be option B.

But earlier, when I calculated using v tau, I got ~6e-16 m, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the correct approach is to use L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, let me think again. The mean lifetime tau is the proper lifetime (in the particle's rest frame). The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the decay distance is v multiplied by gamma tau.

So L= v gamma tau = beta c gamma tau.

Which is the same as beta gamma c tau.

So that gives L= beta gamma c tau.

So in this case, beta gamma=6.6, as above.

So L=6.6 *3e8 m/s *2.056e-24 s.

Compute:

6.6 *3e8 =1.98e9.

1.98e9 *2.056e-24 = (1.98 *2.056 )e-15.

1.98 *2.056 is approx 4.06e.

So 4.06e-15 m. So option B.

Ah, so the correct answer is option B:4.0655e-15 m.

I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering that the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by a factor of gamma. So the decay distance is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime (gamma tau), not the proper lifetime.

So the correct calculation uses L= beta gamma c tau.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for decay distance:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]

where \( v \) is the velocity of the particle and \( \tau \) is its lifetime. The velocity \( v \) is derived from relativistic mechanics, and the lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

### Step 1: Relating \( \Gamma \) and \( \tau \)
The decay width \( \Gamma \) is related to the lifetime \( \tau \) by:

\[
\Gamma = \frac{\hbar}{\tau} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \), the lifetime is:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is determined using the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = \frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}
\]

where \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(1.2)^2}{8^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v = \beta c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the decay distance \( L \)
The decay distance is given by:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]

Substituting \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau \approx 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 2.966 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \approx 6.102 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

However, this result does not match the provided options. To resolve this, we consider the relativistic factor \( \gamma \), which is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

The decay distance in the lab frame is then:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056 \times 10^{-24}
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.6
\]

Then:

\[
L = 6.6 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \approx 4.06 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.06 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
