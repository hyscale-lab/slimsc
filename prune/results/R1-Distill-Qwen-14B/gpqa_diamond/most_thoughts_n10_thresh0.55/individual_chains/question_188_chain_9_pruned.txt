Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters. But wait, rhombohedral structures have all sides equal and all angles the same, right? So the lattice is more symmetric in a way.

The given data: interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which in a crystal structure would be the edge length 'a' of the unit cell. So in a rhombohedral structure, which I think is also called a trigonal crystal system, the unit cell has all edges equal and all angles equal. So a = 10 Angstroms here.

The question is about the (111) plane. The interplanar distance (d-spacing) for a plane hkl is given by the formula 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) multiplied by something... Wait, no, wait. I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But wait, is that only for cubic systems? Because in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell isn't cubic, so maybe the formula is different.

Oh right, the interplanar distance formula for a general rhombohedral system is a bit more complicated
