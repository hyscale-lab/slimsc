Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the major product when 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene reacts with maleic anhydride. Hmm, I remember that maleic anhydride is a dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions. So this must be a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, the structure of 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. Let me draw that out mentally. Cyclopenta-diene would have two double bonds, right? So positions 1 and 3 are double bonds. Oh wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making it a conjugated diene. And there's a fluorine at position 5. So the structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, and a fluorine attached.

Wait, no, wait. Cyclopentadiene is actually a 1,3-diene, so the ring has four carbons in a row with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. The fifth position would be the one opposite the 1 and 3, so maybe at position 5? So the fluorine is attached to that carbon.

Now, maleic anhydride is a good dienophile. The Diels-Alder reaction is between a diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered cyclohexene derivative. But wait, in this case, the diene is cyclopentadiene, which
