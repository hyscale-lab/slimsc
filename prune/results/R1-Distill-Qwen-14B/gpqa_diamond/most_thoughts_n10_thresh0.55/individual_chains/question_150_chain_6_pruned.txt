Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, so I should probably start by analyzing that to figure out the structure of the starting material. Then, I'll look at the reagents used and determine what reactions happen, and finally, identify the product from the options given.

First, the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm: triplet integrating to 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so it's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group?

- 6.98 ppm: doublet integrating to 2H. This is likely aromatic protons. The doublet could mean they're adjacent to another proton. Maybe part of a para-substituted benzene ring? Wait, wait, in a para-substituted benzene, each proton is a doublet because they're next to each other in a coupling with the two protons on adjacent carbons. Hmm, not sure yet.

- 6.51 ppm: also a doublet, 2H. Another aromatic region. Could this be another aromatic ring? Like, maybe the molecule has two benzene rings connected in some way.

- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet, 2H. A broad signal suggests possible exchange with something, like an acidic proton. Maybe an enol proton or a hydroxyl group. But wait, if it's a singlet, maybe it's a CH2 group in between two aromatic rings?

- 3.66 ppm: doublet, 2H. This is probably a CH2 group attached to something that splits the signal. The shift of around 3.6 ppm makes me think of an OCH2 group, maybe adjacent to an oxygen or another electronegative atom.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has two benzene rings connected by a chain that includes an aldehyde, some CH2 groups, and possibly an oxygen somewhere. Let's try to sketch this.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = (9)/2=4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, did I get the formula wrong? Oh wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So X is 0 (no halogens), N is 1, O is 1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1 +0)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be five rings and double bonds. But more likely, a combination.

Each benzene ring contributes 4 degrees (3 double bonds or three ringsâ€”no, each benzene is three double bonds, so 4 degrees if it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds and one ring. Wait
