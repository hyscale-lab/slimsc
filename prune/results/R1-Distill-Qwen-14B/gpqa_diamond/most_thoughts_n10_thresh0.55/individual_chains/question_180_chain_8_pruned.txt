Okay, so I've got this physics problem here and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places, and choose the right option from the given choices.

Hmm, okay. So, the system consists of a central charge fixed at point P and 12 other charges each located 2 meters away from P. Since all these are charged particles, I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem.

I remember that the electrostatic potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Wait, but in this case, there are multiple charges. So I need to calculate the potential energy for each pair and then sum them all up. Because the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair in the system.

So, how many pairs are there? Let's see. There's the central charge (let's call it Q) and the 12 surrounding charges (each q). Also, the 12 surrounding charges are all at the same distance from Q, so the potential energy between Q and each q will be the same, and I can calculate that for each and sum them.

Additionally, I have to consider the potential energy between each pair of the surrounding charges. Since they are all at the same distance from Q, but their mutual distances vary, wait, no. Wait, if all the 12 surrounding charges are at the same distance from Q, that would imply they are arranged in some symmetrical fashion, maybe on a sphere. But I don't know if their positions are such that each is equidistant from every other charge. Hmm, but wait, if they're all at 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. So maybe their mutual distances can vary.

Wait, but the question says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So they're on a sphere of radius 2 m, but their exact positions on the sphere aren't specified. So, for the potential energy between them
