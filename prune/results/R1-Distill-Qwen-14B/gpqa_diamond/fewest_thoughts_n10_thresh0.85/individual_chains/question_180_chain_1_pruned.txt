Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see... The problem is about calculating the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with charges and potential energy, Coulomb's law is probably involved here.

The setup is: there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay 2 meters away from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the system has a charge at the center and 12 around it.

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy of the system. I think this relates to the potential energy between the charges. Because in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions.

But wait, the system is isolated, so maybe the potential energy is calculated differently. Oh right, the potential energy of a system of point charges is given by the formula U = (1/(4πε₀)) * Σ (q_i q_j / r_ij), for all i < j. But since 12 charges are at the same distance from P, their distances to each other might be different. Wait, no, each of the 12 is at 2 meters from P, but what about their distances from each other?

Wait, the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P. So, are they arranged in a way where each is on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m? Maybe they form a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) on a circle of radius 2 m, but in 3D, perhaps a sphere? Hmm, but the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but it doesn't specify their arrangement among themselves. Oh, but wait, for the potential energy, we might need to calculate the potential between each pair.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from this central charge. So the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 is (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e)/(2 m). But wait, how about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because each of them
