Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2 in a specific energy level. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, when atoms are excited, it refers to their energy states. So the excitation level is higher in star_1. I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere relates to the thermal energy of the star. The higher the temperature, the more excited the atoms are because thermal energy excites them to higher energy levels.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, that's probably the delta E. And the question says to assume LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So each small region of the photosphere is in equilibrium, allowing us to use the Boltzmann distribution.

Right, the Boltzmann equation! It relates the number of atoms in different energy states to the temperature. The formula is something like N_upper / N_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, and k is Boltzmann's constant. But wait, in this case, the excitation level is given as twice. So maybe the ratio of populations is N1/N2 = 2, where N1 is star_1 and N2 is star_2.

But wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So does that mean that the number of atoms in the higher energy level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2? Or does it mean the excitation energy is higher? I think it's the former; that the population ratio is the factor of two.

So, the setup would be (N1/N2) = 2. So using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

For star_1: N1/N_lower1 = (g1/g_lower1) exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))

For star_2: N2/N_lower2 = (g2/g_lower2) exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Wait, but wait a minute. Are the lower energy levels the same for both stars? I think so. So perhaps the ratio N1/N2 = [ (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT1)) ] / [ (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT2)) ].

Wait, actually, if both stars have the same transition, then the g_upper and g_lower would be the same for both, so they cancel out. So N1/N2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, let me make sure. Because the exponents would be: -ΔE/(k T1) for star 1, and -ΔE/(k T2) for star 2.

So when we take the ratio N1
