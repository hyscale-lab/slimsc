Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no: same direction as the beam, and moving toward the observer. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me read it again. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, no, that can't be. Because if the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam (which is toward the observer), that would mean the beam is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the glass is moving towards the observer in the same way the light is. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving towards the observer, but inside the glass.

Wait, no, wait. The light is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving in the same direction as the beam. Hmm, but the beam is going through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement.

Wait, but the glass is moving toward the observer. So the beam is coming towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. But the beam is inside the glass, so its speed relative to the glass is c/n, right? Because in a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c/n.

But wait, the problem is about the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab. So we're dealing with a situation where the medium (glass) is moving relative to the lab. So we need to find the speed of light as observed in the lab frame when the medium is moving.

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The velocity addition formula comes into play. But wait, does that apply here? The glass is moving at velocity v. So perhaps we can model this as the speed of light in the glass's frame, and then apply the velocity addition formula to get it into the lab frame.

Wait, but the problem is about the speed of light, which is always c in a vacuum, but here, the light is in a medium, so its speed is c/n in the glass's rest frame. But wait, is the glass moving? Oh, right, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab.

So, let's think in the glass's rest frame. In that frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. Now, we need to find the speed of the light as observed from the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass.

Wait, wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light inside it is moving at c
