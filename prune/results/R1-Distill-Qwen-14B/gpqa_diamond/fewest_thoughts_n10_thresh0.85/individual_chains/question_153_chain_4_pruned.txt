Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember involves enolates attacking a carbonyl compound. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them to the options given.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate are reacting under NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, sodium ethoxide is a base; I think it deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. Malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form a stable enolate. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an acceptor because it has an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester.

In the Michael addition, the enolate (from malonate) will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, the nucleophilic enolate will add to the acrylate. Since the acrylate is in the E configuration, the major product should come from the anti addition, but wait, in Michael addition, the approach is such that the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta carbon, which is the less substituted in the case of E-geometry. Wait, no, E-geometry has the substituents opposite each other. So for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the p-tolyl and the ester groups are on opposite sides.

But when the enolate attacks, it'll add to the beta carbon. The attack would likely be from the less hindered side. So the product would be a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's alpha carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate. Then, the two carbonyl groups from the malonate will end up on either side of the new bond.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH2COOEt)2. When it forms the enolate, it has a negative charge on the central carbon. When this enolate attacks the acrylate, it should add to the beta carbon. The acrylate structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOEt? No, wait: the structure is CH2CH2C=O? Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOEt? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So in this case, it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. The 3-position would be the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? Or is it CH2-C(=O)-COOEt, with the p-tolyl on the CH2?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acry
