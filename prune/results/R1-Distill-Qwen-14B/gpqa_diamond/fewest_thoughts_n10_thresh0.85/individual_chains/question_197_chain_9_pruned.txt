Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in some kind of reaction... Oh wait, that's the Clemmensen reduction, right? Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. Yeah, because HI is a source of H- (the hydride ion) in that reaction.

But first, I need to figure out what the starting compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data.

Starting with the IR: The peaks are 3400–2500 cm-1, which might be an O-H stretch or maybe an alkyne. Oh wait, but another peak at 1720 cm-1— that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has a carbonyl group and aromatic rings. Maybe it's a ketone with a benzene ring.

Looking at the NMR data: The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Because the -COOH proton is around 10-12 ppm. But wait, the IR doesn't show a broad peak around 3000, which might suggest O-H. Or does it? The IR shows a broad region from 3400-2500, which could be O-H stretching. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR also has 1720 cm-1, which would fit a carbonyl. Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. Wait, but if it's a ketone, the carbonyl would be a bit higher, so 1720 is higher than a typical ketone but could fit a carboxylic acid. Hmm. Also, the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is probably a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, the triplet is for 3H, so maybe a terminal CH3 in a chain.

The NMR shows:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) — maybe a carboxylic acid proton? But 10.5 is high for an aldehyde. Or maybe an acidic proton like an aromatic alcohol, but that's less likely.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): That's a doublet, likely from two aromatic protons in para positions. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, perhaps the other two aromatic protons. So it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, with two substituents in para positions
