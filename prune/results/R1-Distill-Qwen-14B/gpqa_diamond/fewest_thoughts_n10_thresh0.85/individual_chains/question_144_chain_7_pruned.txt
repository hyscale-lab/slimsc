Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me think about what I remember. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, okay, first, I should recall how to find the mean decay distance. I think the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like L = γ * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

But wait, τ is the mean lifetime, and it's related to the decay width Γ. I remember that the mean lifetime τ is the inverse of the total decay width, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, actually Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ/(Γ), but I need to make sure about the units here.

Wait, no. Let me double-check: the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. Oh wait, no, because Γ is the total width, and the lifetime is inversely proportional. So τ = ħ/(Γ). But I think I have to be careful with the units because ħ is in units of GeV·s or something.

Okay, now, the mean decay distance L is the product of the particle's velocity v, the lifetime τ, and the speed of light. Wait, no, wait. L is v multiplied by the lifetime τ times the speed of light? Hmm, no. Let me think again. The particle moves at a certain velocity, so the distance it travels before decaying is L = v * τ * c? No, wait, no. The lifetime τ is measured in the rest frame. The lab frame would see a longer lifetime due to time dilation. So the Lorentz factor γ comes into play. So the lifetime
