Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see if I can figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question involves a series of reactions leading from compound A to E. There are also hints provided, so I'll need to use those to deduce the structures.

First, let's break down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:
a) When compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Options are four different cyclic ketones. So, I'm thinking E is a ketone. The IR peaks suggest carbonyl groups. 1750 is typical for esters or maybe ketones, but in A, and E has 1715, which is about right for a ketone. So E is a ketone, A might be an ester or maybe a ketone too.

Let's start with hint a). The reaction of A with a phosphorus ylide gives 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, phosphorus ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So, if A reacts with a ylide to form an alkene, A must have a carbonyl group.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this structure. So it's a cyclopentane ring. At positions 1 and 2, there are methyl groups. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2-C(CH3)2 group attached via a double bond? Wait, no, the ylidene group is CH2-C(CH3)=, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a substituent where the double bond is attached to a carbon that's part of a propyl group, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent like (CH2)2CH2 with a double bond?

Wait, the structure of the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituents are on the cyclopentane ring. The propan-2-ylidene group is a substituent attached to the ring, and it's a ylidene group, meaning that it's connected via a double bond. So the structure would be cyclopentane with a double bond in the substituent. Like, the substituent is (CH2)C(CH3)=, but I'm not exactly getting the structure right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane or something else.

Wait, another approach. The product from the Wittig reaction is an alkene. If A is a carbonyl compound (like a ketone or aldehyde), the Wittig would form an alkene. So, A is a carbonyl compound, and the product is an alkene. So, A must have a carbonyl group adjacent to where the Wittig adds, forming a double bond.

So, the product is a cyclopentane with a double bond in a substituent. So, perhaps A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Because, in the Wittig reaction, the ylide would attack the carbonyl group, forming an alkene.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me imagine
