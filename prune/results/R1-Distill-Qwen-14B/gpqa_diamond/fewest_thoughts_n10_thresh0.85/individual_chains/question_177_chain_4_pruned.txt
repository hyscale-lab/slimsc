Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. Okay, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, and how much greater Star_1's luminosity is compared to Star_2. Hmm, I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits, right?

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger, but I'm not sure if mass matters here. The question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature, not mass. Oh, but wait, they also mention that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So same λ_max implies same temperature?

Wait, wait. Because if they have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because the formula says λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ1 = λ2, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature. That's a crucial point.

Now, the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for the luminosity of a star as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law. So L is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

Since both stars have the same temperature, T, the ratio of their luminosities will depend on the ratio of their radii squared. Because L ∝ R² T⁴, and T is same, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem says that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times larger than Star_2's. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5. Therefore, (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. So the answer should be around 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, the options also include 2.23, 2.32, and 2.35. Hmm, did I miss something? Let me read the question again.

Oh, the problem says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Hmm, what does that have to do with it? Radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But how does that affect the observed luminosity?

Wait, but wait, luminosity is an intrinsic property. Wait, no, because when you observe a star, what you measure is flux, not luminosity. Flux depends on the star's luminosity and distance. But in this problem, I think they are computing the actual luminosity, not the observed flux. Because the question says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..."

So the radial velocity might affect the observed flux due to Doppler shift. Oh, because if a star is moving towards us (or away), the light we receive is Doppler shifted. But wait, in this case, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its light isn't shifted. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Hmm, but how does that affect the calculation of luminosity?

Wait, the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies, so perhaps we're considering their intrinsic properties. Or maybe the observed brightness (flux) is affected by the Doppler shift. Let me think.

The flux from a star is F = L / (4πd²), where d is the distance. But if the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is blueshifted, which might affect the observed flux if we're integrating over a specific band or using a certain filter. But the question says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that plays into the calculation of luminosity.

Wait, maybe the Doppler effect affects the perceived temperature? Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, which would make it appear hotter. But the problem says that the peak wavelengths are the same, so perhaps the effect of radial velocity has already been accounted for in the temperature calculation. Or perhaps the question is assuming that the stars' rest frames are what's important, so the radial velocity doesn't affect their intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, maybe the radial velocity affects the observed flux because of the Doppler effect. So when a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, which can increase the flux in the observed wavelengths. But the problem says that the same peak wavelengths are observed, so perhaps the Doppler shift has been taken into account to infer the actual temperature. So the temperatures are the same in their rest frames.

Alternatively, the radial velocities might not affect the calculation of luminosity because luminosity
