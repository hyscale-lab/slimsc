Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should choose that one. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the setup: Two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, are Earth-like. They've been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is orbiting much faster. Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things.

The stars they're orbiting are different. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's interesting because usually, more massive stars are larger, but in this case, they've evolved so that Planet_2's host is slightly evolved and has the same radius as Planet_1's, which is less massive. Wait, no, actually, Planet_1's star is twice as massive but same radius. That might mean it's more evolved, but the question says Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. So maybe Planet_1's star is more evolved, but same radius. I'm not sure how that affects the transit probability, though.

So the question is about the transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit. The formula I think is something like (R_star / a) where a is the orbital distance. But wait, more accurately, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor, perhaps including the inclination, but since we're comparing probabilities, maybe the other factors are the same for both.

Wait, but maybe it's more precise. The transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_s / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_s)^(1/3)) ), but wait, that's for the occurrence rate, but considering that both planets have the same mass and we're considering their known RV-derived data, maybe that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a), multiplied by the impact parameter. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The probability that a planet's orbit will cause a transit from our point of view depends on how likely the orbital plane is aligned edge
