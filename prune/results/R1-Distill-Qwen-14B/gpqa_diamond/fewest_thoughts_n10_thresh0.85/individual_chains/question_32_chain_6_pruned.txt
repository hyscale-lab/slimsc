Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and I need to find the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei, but in this case, it's a lithium nucleus with 3 neutrons. Oh wait, lithium has 3 protons too, right? So that makes it Li-6 maybe? Because 3 protons and 3 neutrons add up to 6 nucleons.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So the atomic number is 3, and the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So it's the Li-6 isotope. Got it.

The question is about the energy of RHIC which imparts a speed of 0.96c to the nucleus. I think I need to calculate the relativistic energy. Oh right, because at such high speeds, relativistic effects are significant.

So, the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m_0 * c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can plug in v = 0.96c.

Let me calculate gamma first. Let's compute 1 - (v²)/(c²). Since v is 0.96c, v² is (0.96)^2 c². So 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Then the square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let's see, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28² is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute it more accurately. Let me do 0.96 * 0.96. 0.96 * 96 is 9216, so 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root
