Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reactions, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the products for each and then match them to the given options.

First, let's recall what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile (like an enolate) to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, leading to a conjugate addition, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. The product is typically a beta-substituted carbonyl compound, and in some cases, it can form a ring if the nucleophile is cyclic.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ A**

Okay, so dimethyl malonate is a good dienophile and can act as a Michael donor, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, dimethyl malonate is a dienophile in the Diels-Alder reaction, but in the Michael reaction, it's the nucleophilic part. Oh wait, no. Wait, in the Michael reaction, the nucleophile is the enolate, and the acceptor is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So here, is dimethyl malonate the nucleophile or the acceptor?

Wait, dimethyl malonate has two ester groups. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. So, it's a good dienophile, but in the context of the Michael reaction, when would it be used? Oh, wait, wait! Maybe it's acting as the enolate in this case. But wait, dimethyl malonate is a symmetric molecule. It can form an enolate, but since it's symmetric, the attack would be at either end.

Wait, but the other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw the structure. The acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the E configuration. So the structure
