Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Wait, uniform distribution in the sky—does that mean the number of stars is the same in all directions? Or maybe they're spread out uniformly in space? I think it's the latter because if they're uniformly distributed in space, their density is the same everywhere. So the number of stars you'd expect to see in a certain volume depends on that volume.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/distance.

Wait, the problem is asking about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So I'm looking for N(plx) d(plx), the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + d(plx).

Since stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. Let's call that number density n. So the number of stars in a volume element depends on the volume and this n.

But how does parallax relate to the volume? Well, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. So for a given parallax value, the distance is d = 1/plx.

I think I should express the volume in terms of parallax. Let me consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d, with thickness dd. The volume of the shell would be 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the shell volume is the difference between two adjacent shells: (4/3)π(d+dd)^3 - (4/3)π d³ ≈ 4π d² dd when dd is small.

So the number of stars in this shell would be n * 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/plx, let's substitute that in. So d = 1/plx → d = plx^{-1}.

Wait, so substituting d into the equation: number of stars in that shell is n * 4π ( (1/plx) )² dd. And since dd is the change in d, we can relate that to the change in plx. Because d = 1/plx, so
