Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let me try to think this through. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the setup is that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. And I need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, Band 2 is 800-900 keV. The options are A to D.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember the Sun's fusion process starts with the proton-proton chain, which has a couple of branches. The main pp-I branch is the dominant one, I think. Then there's pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is the one where a carbon-13 is produced. Right, so in the pp-III process, two protons combine with a carbon-12 nucleus to make a carbon-13 and two positrons. Then, the carbon-13 can go on to produce nitrogen-14 via the CNO cycle or maybe decay back.

Wait, but neutrinos are involved in these processes. Oh right, the proton-proton chain produces neutrinos mainly via the pp-I branch, which is the most common. The pp-III branch is a minor part. So if pp-III suddenly stops, what does that mean for the neutrino flux?

Neutrinos are produced in various ways. The main pp-I process produces a lot of neutrinos. The pp-III process produces neutrinos too, but less so. So if pp-III stops, then the number of neutrinos from that process would drop. But wait, the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So only the pp-III branch is stopped.

But how does this affect the neutrino flux observed on Earth? Because neutrinos from the Sun take about 8 minutes to reach us, so if the process stopped 8.5 minutes ago, we're just now noticing the change. So the flux would decrease if the pp-III was a significant source.

Wait, but the neutrino flux we detect now is a mix of neutrinos produced in different parts of the Sun and via different processes. If pp-III stopped, which neutrinos would be affected?

Wait, the neutrinos from the pp-I process have a certain energy spectrum, and those from pp-III might have different energies. Like, I think the pp-III process produces higher-energy neutrinos because the carbon-13 is heavier. Or wait, no, maybe not. Let me think.

In the pp-I branch, the main process is two protons fusing into deuterium, then another proton, forming helium-3, and then two helium-3s fusing into helium-4, releasing two positrons and two neutrinos. Each of these neutrinos has a certain energy. The neutrinos from the pp-I branch are lower energy, around 200 keV maybe? Because the Q-value of the reaction is lower. Whereas the pp-III branch might involve higher-energy neutrinos
