Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, I'm assuming they're moving towards each other or in the same direction? Wait, the problem says "positive x-direction", so both moving in the same direction. But wait, wait, the question is about the relative speed between them. Oh right, if they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed would be the difference between their speeds.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh no, wait! In relativity, velocities don't just subtract normally. Because when speeds are a significant fraction of c, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Right, I remember that the formula for the relative speed isn't just v1 - v2, but something more complicated.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, no: if one object is moving at velocity u in the same direction as another object moving at velocity v, then the relative speed of the first from the second's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Or is it the other way around? Let me get this right. So if I'm in the frame of the second astronaut, what's the speed of the first astronaut? Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from B's frame, the speed of A would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c.

Wait, but the question asks for the relative speed, so looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's for the relative speed part.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. So each astronaut has relativistic kinetic energy, and the total energy would be the sum of their energies. Or wait, wait—do I need to consider their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy? Because in relativity, the total energy is gamma times m c squared. So each astronaut's total energy is gamma*m*c², where m is their rest mass, but wait, their masses are given as 2m and 3m. So I think I need to compute the energy for each and sum them.

Let me compute each
