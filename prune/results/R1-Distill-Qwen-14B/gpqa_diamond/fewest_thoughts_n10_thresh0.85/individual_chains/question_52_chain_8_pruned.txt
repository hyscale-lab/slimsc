Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question involves a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When these spots aren't present, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall temperature drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And the question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition wavelength is about 1448 Angstroms, and LTE is assumed.

Hmm, alright. So I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels depends on temperature. The formula I think is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio is n1/n2 without spots versus when it has spots. The ratio decreases when there are spots, so when the star is cooler (with spots), the ratio is lower. So what does that imply about the energy difference between the two levels?

Well, the transition is between two energy levels. The wavelength is given, so I can find the energy difference. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. Using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c the speed of light.

Wait, but when the temperature decreases, the ratio n1/n2 changes. Let me think about how temperature affects this ratio.

The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So as T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, making the exponential term smaller. So n1/n2 decreases when T decreases.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall T is lower (5500 K), and the ratio is observed to decrease. So when the star is hotter (6000 K without spots), the ratio should be higher because the exponent is smaller, so the exponential is larger.

But wait, the ratio is n1/n2, so let's get this straight. If E2 is higher than E1, then E2 - E1 is positive. So when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponential increases. So n1/n2 increases with higher T.

So when the star is hotter (no spots, 6000 K), n1/n2 is higher. When it's cooler (spots, 5500 K), the ratio is lower. So the factor we're looking for is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

But wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star
