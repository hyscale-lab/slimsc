Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which energy difference option would allow us to resolve them clearly?

Hmm. I remember that the uncertainty principle plays a role here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The formula, I think, is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the product of the energy uncertainty and the time (lifetime) should be about ħ over 2.

Wait, but the problem is about distinguishing two states. So the energy difference between them must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, perhaps? Because if the energy difference is too small, the two states might not be resolvable.

Alternatively, the energy resolution might depend on the natural linewidth, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The natural linewidth Γ (gamma) is given by Γ = ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime. So the uncertainty in energy for each state is Γ. So for each state, the uncertainty is Γ1 = ħ/(1e-9) and Γ2 = ħ/(1e-8).

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. To clearly distinguish them, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe the maximum of the two? Or perhaps the difference needs to be greater than the uncertainty in each of them.

Wait, perhaps the key is that each state's uncertainty is Γ1 and Γ2. So the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| must be at least greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2, or something like that. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, I think when you have two states, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because you need to resolve the two peaks, so the separation between their energies should be more than the sum of their linewidths. Because if the separation is less, the lines might overlap, making it hard to distinguish them.

So let's compute each state's uncertainty. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, I should convert units appropriately.

Wait, but perhaps I can express the energy uncertainty in eV. Let me think. 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 joules. So, let's compute Γ1 and Γ2.

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert to eV, divide by 1.60218e-19 J/eV. So 1.0545718e-25 / 1.60218e-19 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.0545718e-26 / 1.60218e-19 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

So Γ1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, Γ2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.

If the energy difference ΔE is to be clearly resolved, it has to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. Wait, but which uncertainties? Because each state has its own uncertainty. So the larger uncertainty is Γ1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in the system's total, but I'm not sure. Let me think of it another way. The energy uncertainty is dominated by the state with the shorter lifetime because Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So τ1 is 1e-9 s, which is shorter than τ2's 1e-8 s. So Γ1 is bigger.

So the energy difference should be larger than Γ1. Because if ΔE is bigger than Γ1, then the two states can be resolved.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the natural linewidth. The natural linewidth is given by the uncertainty principle. So the energy uncertainty for each state is Γ/2, because the uncertainty is about ħ/(2τ). Hmm, wait, the uncertainty principle is ΔE * τ ≈ ħ/2. So ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). So perhaps I should have divided by 2 earlier.

So let's recalculate Γ for each state as ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). So, for Γ1:

Γ1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = 5.27e-26 J. Converting to eV: 5.27e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, Γ2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (1.05457e-34)/(2e-8) )= 5.27e-27 J. In eV, that's 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are Γ1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV and Γ2 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Now, when you have two energy levels, the minimum ΔE needed to resolve them is when ΔE is larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if ΔE is smaller than the sum, the two lines may overlap, making it hard to distinguish them.

So ΔE must be greater than Γ1 + Γ2.

Sum is approximately 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.62e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 eV. Too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → 0.0001e-7 eV. Even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 1e4 * 1e-8 eV. Which is way larger than 3.6e-7. So 1e-4 is 1e4 times bigger than 3.6e-7. So that's way more than needed.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.1e-7 eV. Which is less than the sum (3.6e-7), so not enough.

Wait, the sum is 3.62e-7 eV. So the energy difference has to be larger than that to be resolvable.

Looking at the options, which option is higher than 3.6e-7 eV? Let's see, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So option C is way larger.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.1e-7, which is less than 3.6e-7. So D is not sufficient.

So the only option that's larger than 3.6e-7 eV is option C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, "could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So the correct option must be larger than the required minimum.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the energy difference is determined by the inverse of the longer time. Or maybe the energy difference should be determined by the larger uncertainty.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the uncertainty principle.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So ΔE is approximately ħ/(2Δt). So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is Γ = ħ/(2τ).

So for state 1, Γ1 = ħ/(2*1e-9 s) ≈ 5.27e-26 J → 3.29e-7 eV.

For state 2, Γ2 = ħ/(2*1e-8 s) ≈ 5.27e-27 J → 3.29e-8 eV.

So the uncertainty in E1 is 3.29e-7 eV, and E2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

The energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1|. For us to distinguish them, ΔE must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the energy levels are too close, their spectral lines would overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

So the minimum ΔE is Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 ≈ 3.62e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → 1e-9 is less than 3.6e-7. So no.

B) 1e-11 eV → way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 eV is 1e4 * 1e-8 eV. 1e-4 is much larger than 3.6e-7. So yes, this would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → which is 0.1e-7, which is less than 3.6e-7. So no.

So the correct option is C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the lifetimes are different. So maybe another approach is needed. Like when resolving two peaks, the minimum ΔE is determined by the larger of the two uncertainties. Because the peak with the longer lifetime (E2) has a lower uncertainty. The lower uncertainty peak would have a narrower linewidth. So the dominant uncertainty is from the state with the shorter lifetime (E1), which has a larger uncertainty.

So perhaps the minimum ΔE is determined by Γ1. So ΔE must be larger than Γ1, which is 3.29e-7 eV.

Looking at the options again, option C (1e-4 eV) is way larger than Γ1. So that's the only option that fits.

Another way: perhaps the energy difference is inversely proportional to the shorter of the two lifetimes. Because the shorter lifetime implies a larger uncertainty.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime. Because that's the bigger uncertainty. So if ΔE is larger than Γ1, then the two states can be resolved.

Γ1 is about 3.29e-7 eV. So the energy difference should be >3.29e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C is larger than that.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties, which are determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: 

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

For each state, the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Gamma = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau},
\]

where \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the state. Using \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.60218 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Gamma_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Gamma_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2 \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, compare this minimum \( \Delta E \) with the given options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.001 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition \( \Delta E > 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is **C**.

Answer: C
