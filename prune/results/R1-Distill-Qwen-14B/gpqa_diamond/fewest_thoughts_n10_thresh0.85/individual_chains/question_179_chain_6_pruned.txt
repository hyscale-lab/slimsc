Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics question here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question is about four matrices W, X, Y, Z. I need to analyze each option based on these matrices. The options are about whether certain matrices are unitary, Hermitian, or if their exponentials have certain properties. Hmm.

First, I should probably recall what each concept means. 

A unitary matrix U satisfies U† U = I, where U† is the conjugate transpose. The evolution operator in quantum mechanics is time evolution, and it's represented by a unitary matrix. So if a matrix is unitary, it could be an evolution operator.

An observable in quantum mechanics is represented by a Hermitian matrix. A Hermitian matrix H satisfies H† = H. So for a matrix to be an observable, it must be Hermitian.

The exponential of a matrix e^M is unitary if M is skew-Hermitian (i.e., M† = -M). Because if M is skew-Hermitian, then e^M is unitary. So if X is skew-Hermitian, then e^X would be unitary, and it would be an evolution operator.

Wait, but looking at option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes. The norm would change if e^X isn't unitary. Because unitary operators preserve the norm. So if e^X is not unitary, then multiplying by e^X could change the norm.

So to check if e^X is unitary, we need to see if X is skew-Hermitian. Let's compute X†.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Compute X†, the conjugate transpose. So the columns become rows, and each element is conjugated.

First row becomes column 1, but each element is conjugated. So:

First element: conjugate of i is -i.

So X† would be:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: 2i, 1, i

Wait, wait. Let me write it properly. Let me list each element:

Original X:
Row 1: [i, -1, 2i]
Row 2: [1, 0, 1]
Row 3: [2i, -1, -i]

So X† is the conjugate transpose, so rows become columns and each element is conjugated.

So:

Column 1 of X is [i,1,2i]. Conjugated, that's [-i, 1, -2i]. So that becomes row 1 of X†.

Column 2 of X is [-1,0,-1]. Conjugated, it's [-1,0,-1]. So row 2 of X†.

Column 3 of X is [2i,1,-i]. Conjugated, that's [-2i,1,i]. So row 3 of X†.

So X† is:
Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Now, let's compute X† + X. If X is skew-Hermitian, then X† = -X. So let's see:

Compute
