Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, right, I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base, and pH changes along the way.

Alright, let's break it down. The problem states that 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, this solution is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and the pH at the equivalence point.

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, right? When we dilute it, the concentration decreases. The initial volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) and the concentration is 0.05 M. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). 

Wait, using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1)/V2. Plugging in the numbers: (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh right, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base). The reaction should be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate moles initially. The initial volume of acetic acid is 0.02 L (20 cm³) with 0.05 M, so moles = 0.02 * 0.05 = 0.001 moles. Then, when diluted to 40 cm³, the concentration is 0.025 M, but the total moles remain the same because we're just adding water. So moles of acetic acid after dilution are still 0.001 moles.

When titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume needed to reach equivalence would be (moles of CH3COOH) / (concentration of NaOH). So moles CH3COOH is 0.001, and NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question asks about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³, how much NaOH is added?

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of moles. At 25% titration, that's 25% of the moles of acetic acid. So 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added.

So, for the 25% point, some acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. Let's model this.

The initial solution has 0.001 moles of CH3COOH. After adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, how many moles of NaOH are added? 2.5 cm³ is 0.00
