Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product formed when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, so maybe an O-H stretch or an alkyne. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl, so maybe a ketone or an ester or something. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Now looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Broad signals around 10 ppm usually indicate an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. But wait, sometimes it could be an aldehyde, but aldehydes are around 9-10, but the broadness makes me think it's more likely an -OH, maybe from a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of a para-substituted benzene. The downfield peak is the proton next to the substituent. So if there's a substituent on the benzene ring, like a carbonyl group, that would cause the protons ortho and para to it to split into doublets. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, maybe not. Hmm, but in this case, perhaps it's a single substituent, and the doublets are from adjacent protons. So maybe the substituent is at the para position, making the two adjacent protons each a doublet. So maybe the benzene has a carbonyl group attached, like in a benzoic acid.

Wait, but if there's a carbonyl, like in a ketone or ester, then the ring substituent would be an alkoxy group or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzoyl group attached to something else.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet. Could that be an -OH from a carboxylic acid? So if there's a carbonyl (from the IR at 1720) and an -OH, that would fit a carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking further at the NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That's a multiplet, maybe a CH adjacent to something else, like a carbonyl or an oxygen. Or perhaps it's a -CH2- group near a substituent.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe a -CH2CH2- group, like in an ethyl chain.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, which is often a methyl group attached to something, like a CH(CH3) group. So maybe a -CH(CH3)2? Or perhaps a branching point.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal methyl group, like from an ethyl chain. So maybe something like CH2CH3 attached to another group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that's connected via a chain. Let's think: the substituent on the benzene is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or a carboxylic acid), but wait, the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. In a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but a strong O-H would be present. Alternatively, an ester would have a carbonyl around 1730-1750, but maybe this is a ketone, which is around 1700-1750 as well. Wait, but the IR shows 1720, which is maybe a ketone or an ester, but the presence of an -OH (from the NMR) could complicate things, because esters don't have -OH. So perhaps the compound is a benzoyl group attached to a longer chain that includes an -OH.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The IR has 1720, which is a
