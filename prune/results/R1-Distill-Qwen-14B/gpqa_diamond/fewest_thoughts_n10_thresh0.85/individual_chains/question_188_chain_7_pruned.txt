Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. 

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal again? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where all the lattice vectors are of equal length, and the angles between them are all the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh, and the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait—interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms in the lattice. But in a rhombohedral structure, each lattice vector 'a' would correspond to that interatomic distance. So I think a = 10 Angstroms here.

The formula I remember for interplanar distance is d_{hkl} = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ})) ). Wait, no, wait. Oh right, because in a general crystal system, the interplanar distance depends on the structure of the lattice vectors and the Miller indices of the plane.

Wait, wait, maybe I should write down the formula correctly. For a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the vectors. But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, all angles are equal, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees in this problem.

Wait no, wait. The formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a b c (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α )) / (b² c² sin² α + c² a² sin² β + a² b² sin² γ) ) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, no, that's getting complicated. Maybe for a rhombohedral system, it's simpler because a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma. So let's think about that.

In a rhombohedral system, all edges are equal (a = b = c) and all angles are equal (alpha = beta = gamma = θ). So the formula simplifies.

The general formula for interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) * (a²)/( (a²)(1 - cos² θ) ) ) )

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Alternatively, I remember that for a simple cubic structure (all angles 90 degrees), the interplanar distance is a/sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But when the
