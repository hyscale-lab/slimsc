Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Hmm, let me read it again.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that. 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. Oh wait, so the 13th is at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P.

The question is about finding the minimum energy of the system. I remember that the potential energy between charges is related to their positions, and since the system is isolated, we're probably looking at the total potential energy without any external fields.

So, what's the formula for electric potential energy between point charges? I think the potential energy U between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approx 8.988e9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

But wait, since there are multiple charges, I need to calculate the total potential energy of the entire system. How does that work? Oh right, for a system of multiple point charges, the total electric potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So I need to calculate the energy for every possible pair and add them up.

In this scenario, let's break it down. There are 13 charges: 1 at P, and 12 surrounding it at 2 meters. So, the charges can be divided into two groups: the one at P (let's call it charge A), and the 12 at 2m (charges B1 to B12).

First, let's compute the potential energy between charge A and each of the B charges. Since each B is 2 m away, the distance r is 2 m for each of these pairs. Since charge A is fixed and cannot move, but the Bs are fixed as well, so these contribute to the total energy.

But wait, what about the potential energy between the B charges themselves? Since they are all identical and each is 2 meters from the center, but how are they arranged? Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So, perhaps they are all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m? But their exact arrangement isn't specified beyond that. Hmm, but calculating the potential energy between all pairs would be complicated unless they form a symmetrical configuration, like on a regular dodecahedron or something. However, the problem doesn't specify their exact positions relative to each other, which complicates things.

Wait, but maybe the problem is assuming that the only interaction considered is between each B and A, but not between the Bs themselves? That seems unlikely because the potential energy of the system should include all pairs. But perhaps in this particular setup, since the 12 charges are constrained at 2m from P, and their mutual distances are the same? No, wait
