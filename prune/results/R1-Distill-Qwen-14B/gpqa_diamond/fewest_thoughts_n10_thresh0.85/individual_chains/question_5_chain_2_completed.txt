Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting to learn about eigenvectors and eigenvalues. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, right, I remember that for spin operators, the eigenvalues correspond to ±ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh, right, these look familiar. I think Px, Py, Pz are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So Px = (ħ/2) σx, and similarly for Py and Pz.

The eigenvector we're looking for is for the operator P along some direction n in the x-z plane. So n is a unit vector that lies in the x-z plane. That means it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), maybe? Because the y-component is zero since it's in the x-z plane. So θ here would be the angle from the z-axis, I think.

The operator P along n would be P·n, which is the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in x-z, n_y is zero, so P·n = Px nx + Pz nz.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact form. Let me think. The direction vector n has components (nx, ny, nz), but in this case, since it's in the x-z plane, ny is zero. So n is (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

The operator P should be the vector operator with components Px, Py, Pz. So the operator in the direction n is P·n = nx Px + nz Pz.

Wait, but the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So I need to find the eigenvector of the operator (nx Px + nz Pz) corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Let me write down the matrices for each component. So, Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]], Pz is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]], and Py is (ħ/2)*[[0,-i],[i,0]].

But since n is in the x-z plane, the operator P·n is going to involve only Px and Pz. Because the y-component is zero, Py is multiplied by zero, so it doesn't contribute. So P·n = (ħ/2)(nx σx + nz σz), where σx and σz are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, putting it together, P·n is (ħ/2) (nx σx + nz σz) = (ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].

Wait, let me check that: σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so nx σx becomes [[0, nx], [nx, 0]]. σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so nz σz is [[nz, 0], [0, -nz]]. Adding them together gives [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].

So P·n is (ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, the matrix equation is [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] * (ħ/2) times the vector [a, b]^T equals (ħ/2) times [a, b]^T.

Wait, but when I factor out (ħ/2), I can divide both sides by (ħ/2), giving the matrix equation:

[[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] * [a; b] = [a; b].

So, the matrix equation is:

(nz a + nx b) = a,

(nx a - nz b) = b.

Wait, no, the matrix multiplication would be:

First element: nz * a + nx * b = a,

Second element: nx * a + (-nz) * b = b.

So, the equations are:

nz a + nx b = a,

nx a - nz b = b.

Let me rearrange these equations:

Equation 1: (nz - 1) a + nx b = 0,

Equation 2: nx a + (-nz - 1) b = 0.

Hmm, so we have a homogeneous system of equations. For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. So let's write the coefficient matrix:

Coefficient matrix:

[ (nz - 1), nx ]

[ nx, (-nz -1) ]

The determinant is (nz-1)(-nz -1) - (nx)^2.

Which is [ (-nz)(nz-1) -1*(nz-1) ] - nx^2.

Wait, alternatively, let's compute it as:

(nz -1)(-nz -1) = -(nz)(nz-1) -1*(nz-1) )= -(nz^2 -nz) ) - (nz -1) ) = -(nz^2 - nz + nz -1) ) = -(nz^2 -1) ) = 1 - nz^2.

So determinant is (1 - nz^2) - nx^2.

But since n is a unit vector, nx^2 + nz^2 =1. So 1 - nz^2 = nx^2.

So determinant = nx^2 - nx^2 = 0. Which makes sense because the eigenvalue equation has nontrivial solutions.

So, the two equations are dependent. Let's take equation 1:

(nz -1) a + nx b =0.

We can solve for a in terms of b:

a = [ -nx/(nz -1) ] b.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to express the ratio a/b.

Let me rearrange equation 1:

(nz - 1) a = - nx b.

So, a/b = (-nx)/(nz -1) = nx/(1 - nz).

Alternatively, we can write a = [nx/(1 - nz)] b.

But let's express this in terms of angles. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, we can parametrize it using an angle θ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So:

nx = sinθ,

nz = cosθ.

Because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sinθ cosφ, but since n is in x-z (so φ is 0 or π), it's just sinθ for x and cosθ for z.

So substituting:

a/b = [ sinθ ] / [1 - cosθ ].

Hmm, I can use a trigonometric identity here. Let me recall that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So,

a/b = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] 

= [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ]

= cot(θ/2)

So, a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Let me write this as a = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * b.

So, the eigenvector can be expressed as [a; b] = [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] multiplied by a scalar. But wait, because a = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * b.

Wait, let's choose b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2). So the vector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].

Wait, but I should check that. Let me plug θ = 0. Wait, θ=0 would mean n is along +z direction. Then the eigenvector should be (1,0), because for Pz, the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [1; 0].

Wait, if θ=0, then cos(theta/2)=cos(0)=1, sin(theta/2)=0. So the vector would be [1, 0], which is correct.

Similarly, if theta=pi, then cos(theta/2)=cos(pi/2)=0, sin(theta/2)=sin(pi/2)=1. So the vector would be [0,1], which is the eigenstate for the -z direction, but wait, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, in this case, when theta=pi, n is pointing along -z, so Pn would have eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So the eigenstate for + would be [0,1], which is correct.

So the general form of the eigenvector seems to be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, but wait a second, the eigenvectors are determined up to a phase. Because if you multiply by any scalar, including complex phases, it's still the same eigenvector. So perhaps the general solution is proportional to [e^{-i phi} cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)]? Or maybe a phase factor elsewhere.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the given options don't seem to have complex components except option B and maybe D. So, perhaps the eigenvector is real, except for phase factors. Let me think again.

Wait, the operator P·n is Hermitian because it's a spin component along a direction. So its eigenvectors can be taken as real vectors. Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Because for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvectors can be written with complex components, but in this case, since n is in the x-z plane, maybe the eigenvector can be real.

Wait, but let me think about the eigenvector. So, with the assumption that a = cos(theta/2) and b = sin(theta/2), that gives us a real vector.

So the normalized eigenvector would have components [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, but let me check normalization. The vector [a, b] must satisfy |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

In this case, cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) = 1, so yes, it's normalized.

So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options:

Option C: ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Option B: ( cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

Option D: ( sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) )

Option A: ( sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar )

Wait, option C seems to match what I have, but without any hbar. Wait, the answer options have hbar in some of them. But wait, in the question, the eigenvector is the normalized one. The components of the eigenvector are just the coefficients, so they should be dimensionless. The hbar is in the eigenvalue, not in the eigenvector.

Wait, looking back, the question says "what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So the eigenvector is a vector in the Hilbert space, so its components should be dimensionless. So any option with hbar in the components is probably incorrect.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which fits. But let me look at the other options.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar times cos(theta/2), which would imply that the components have units of hbar. That can't be right because the eigenvector is a state vector, and its components are pure numbers (dimensionless).

So, why is option C an option? Let me think again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The eigenvector I found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] but perhaps I need to include a phase factor or something else.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvector of the operator along an arbitrary direction in x-z plane. The direction is (nx, 0, nz) = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so theta is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, but I think I might have mixed up the angle. Because the direction in x-z plane can also be represented as theta from the x-axis, but I think in this case, we're using the standard spherical angle where theta is measured from the z-axis, so that's correct.

Wait, but another approach: the spin-up state along any direction n is given by [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)]^T. But in this problem, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi, so e^{i phi} is either 1 or -1. So the state becomes [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] or [cos(theta/2), -sin(theta/2)].

But in our case, the eigenvalue is positive, so maybe the phase is positive. But in any case, the general form is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So the correct option would be option C.

But let me double-check the options.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that's exactly what we derived.

So the normalized eigenvector has components (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking back at the options, option C is this.

Wait, but what about the other options?

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar). That seems like a specific case, perhaps for theta = 45 degrees, but it's not general. Also, including hbar is wrong.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)). That would be the case if the state was |theta, phi>, like in spherical coordinates, but our state is (theta/2). So this doesn't fit.

Option D: sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2). Again, hbar is present, which is wrong.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ simplifies to $P_x n_x + P_z n_z$, as $P_y$ does not contribute.

The direction vector $\vec{n}$ can be parametrized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis. Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes proportional to the matrix:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation $(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}) | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle$ is solved to find the eigenvector. Solving this equation, the components of the eigenvector are found to be proportional to $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$. This result is consistent with the standard eigenstate of a spin-1/2 system along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
   This represents a specific case and includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect since the eigenvector components are dimensionless.

2. **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$  
   This form corresponds to spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

3. **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
   This matches the derived eigenvector exactly and is normalized.

4. **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
   This includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect, and the coefficients do not match the derived eigenvector.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

Answer: C
