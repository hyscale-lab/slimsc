Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. The question is about identifying the kinematically allowed decay channels for this boson X. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a particle depends on a few factors, like its mass and the masses of the particles it decays into. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this is part of a Yukawa interaction because it involves a fermion field ψ and a boson X. The Yukawa interaction is responsible for things like the mass of fermions when the Higgs field gets a vacuum expectation value (VEV), which is υ here.

Wait, the mass term for the fermions comes from this interaction. The Yukawa coupling λ would determine how strong the interaction is. So, when the X boson (which is similar to the Higgs in this context) decays, it can produce fermion-antifermion pairs. The types of fermions it can decay into depend on whether their mass is less than or equal to half the mass of X.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, for the decay X → f f̄ to be possible, the mass of f must satisfy m_f ≤ M_X / 2. Because each fermion would take at most half the mass energy, right?

Now, what's the fermion mass landscape? Let me think about the known fermion masses. Quarks come in different flavors with varying masses. Up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Similarly, leptons are electrons, muons, taus, etc.

But wait, the top quark is super heavy, like around 173 GeV. So, since X is only 6 GeV, it can't decay into top quarks because m_top is way bigger than half of 6 GeV (which is 3 GeV). So top quarks are out.

What about the bottom quark? The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. So half of X's mass is 3 GeV. 4.5 is bigger than 3, so the bottom quark can't be produced. So X can't decay into b b̄.

Wait, but wait. I might have confused the numbers. Let me double-check. The bottom quark mass is approximately 4.5 GeV, right? So 4.5 GeV is more than 3 GeV. So X can't produce a b and anti-b.

What about the charm quark? Charm is about 1.5 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So yes, X can decay into c c̄.

Same with the other quarks. Up and down quarks have masses around a few MeV, so way below 3 GeV. Strange quark is about 100 MeV, I think, which is also under 3 GeV. So X can decay into u ū, d d̄, s s̄
