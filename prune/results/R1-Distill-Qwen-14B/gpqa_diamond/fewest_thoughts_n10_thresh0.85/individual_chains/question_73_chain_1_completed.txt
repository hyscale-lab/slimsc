Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my special relativity, but let's try to think this through.

The problem states that astronaut A has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, while astronaut B has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting velocities. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. But wait, wait, aren't they moving in the same direction? So the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²), where u and v are the velocities of the two objects. Oh wait, actually, let me think again. Let me get the formula correctly. The correct formula when both velocities are in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

So let's plug in the numbers. Wait, which one is u and which is v? Since astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, so if I'm finding the speed of B as seen from A's frame, u would be A's speed (0.6c) and v would be B's speed (0.5c), right? Or wait, no. Wait, the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) when you want to find the velocity of v relative to u. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think: the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), but I need to figure out which is which. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of frames. Let's say we're in the rest frame of astronaut A. Then, what's the speed of astronaut B as seen by A?

So in the rest frame of A, the speed of B would be (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). But wait, v_A is 0.6c, and v_B is 0.5c. So that would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator. The numerator is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approx -0.1428c. But speed can't be negative, so the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, I see option C and D mention 0.14c, so that's a clue.

Now, for the total energy of the system. I remember that the total energy in relativity is the sum of the rest mass energies, but wait, no, each object's energy is gamma multiplied by m c squared. So the total energy is the sum of the energies of each astronaut.

So for each astronaut, calculate gamma times their mass times c squared, then sum them.

Starting with astronaut A: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So (0.6c)^2 is 0.36c². So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64, sqrt is 0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy for A is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So total energy is about 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc². So the correct answer for energy is 5.96, which matches option C.

Wait, but wait. Do I need to consider whether the astronauts are moving in the same frame? Because when we calculate energy, it's from the perspective of the same frame. The problem doesn't specify the frame, so I think we're calculating each in the lab frame, perhaps. Or maybe it's the rest frame of the combined system, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is just the sum of their energies in the lab frame.

Wait, but the problem says 'the total energy of the system.' So in the rest frame of the system, but that requires more work. Is that the case here?

Oh wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says, "what will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?" So the relative speed is in one frame, but the total energy could be the sum in any frame. But I think the problem is asking for the sum of their energies in the same frame, probably the lab frame.

Wait, but if the two astronauts are moving in the same direction at those speeds, perhaps the question is referring to the center-of-momentum frame. Hmm, but the options don't seem to align with that. Let me think.

Wait, no. The problem says "the total energy of the system," which, in relativity, is frame-dependent. But when no frame is specified, perhaps it's in the lab frame. Alternatively, the system's rest frame would have total energy as the invariant mass. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the sum of their energies in the same frame. For instance, if both are moving in the same direction in the lab frame, then each contributes their relativistic energy. So the total energy would be the sum of their energies in that frame.

In that case, the calculation I did earlier would be correct, leading to about 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

So putting it all together, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) (astronaut A's speed) and \(v_B = 0.5c\) (astronaut B's speed). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For astronaut A:
- Mass \(m_A = 2m\), speed \(v_A = 0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy \(E_A = \gamma_A m_A c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\)

#### For astronaut B:
- Mass \(m_B = 3m\), speed \(v_B = 0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy \(E_B = \gamma_B m_B c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
