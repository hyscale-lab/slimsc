Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think about it. Okay, the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the energy-time uncertainty principle. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. But for this problem, I think the exact inequality might not matter as much as the order of magnitude.

So, the idea is that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ. Since we're dealing with the lifetimes of the states, I think Δt here is the lifetime of the state because that's how long the energy is measured for. So, for each state, we can estimate the uncertainty in energy.

Wait, but wait. The energies E1 and E2 are the energies of the states, but the question is about the energy difference between them. Oh right, so the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. We need to find what ΔE should be so that the two states can be clearly distinguished. So, the uncertainty in ΔE must be such that it's small enough that E2 and E1 are resolvable.

Hmm, but each state has its own uncertainty. Oh, maybe the key here is the uncertainty in the energy difference. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think again.

The energy-time uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is approximately ħ. So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. But wait, the lifetimes are given as the time for each state. So for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(1e-9). Similarly for the second state, Δt2 = 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(1e-8). 

But wait, no, because if we have two states, I'm not sure if we're looking at the uncertainty in each state's energy or the uncertainty in their energy difference. Because when you have two states, the energy difference is what matters for their distinguishability.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about the minimum energy difference that can be resolved given their lifetimes. Because the lifetimes affect the uncertainty in their energy measurements. So, the energy difference should be larger than the combined uncertainty so that they can be distinguished.

Alternatively, maybe each state's energy has an uncertainty, and the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to ensure they are different. Or perhaps the energy difference should be larger than each's individual uncertainty. Hmm.

Let me think step by step.

The energy-time uncertainty principle: ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). So for the first state, Δt = 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2e-9). Similarly for the second state, Δt = 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2e-8). 

Now, what's ħ? Planck's constant over 2π. I think ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But since the answer options are in eV, I should probably convert everything into eV.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So, let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Compute ħ/(2Δt) for each Δt.

First, Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 ≈ (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) ≈ 5.273e-26 J.

Convert J to eV: 5.273e-26 J * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ 5.273e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ approximately 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for Δt2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) = 5.273e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.273e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So, perhaps to clearly distinguish them, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or maybe just greater than one of them? Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think about this. Suppose we have two states with energies E1 and E2. The uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1, and the uncertainty in E2 is ΔE2. The uncertainty in their difference (E2 - E1) is sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²), assuming the uncertainties are independent. 

But for the energy difference to be clearly distinguishable, the actual difference (ΔE) should be larger than the uncertainty in ΔE. So, ΔE > sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 )

So let's compute that.

ΔE1 is approximately 3.29e-7 eV.

ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

So, square each:

(3.29e-7)^2 ≈ 1.08e-13

(3.29e-8)^2 ≈ 1.08e-15

Sum: 1.08e-13 + 1.08e-15 ≈ 1.0908e-13.

Square root of that is sqrt(1.0908e-13) ≈ approx 3.3e-7 eV.

So the uncertainty in the energy difference is about 3.3e-7 eV.

Therefore, the energy difference ΔE should be larger than this to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 3.3e-7 eV, so it would be resolvable.

Option A is 1e-9 eV, which is smaller than 3.3e-7 eV. So it's not enough.

Option B is 1e-11 eV, even smaller. So no.

Option D is 1e-8 eV. That's 0.01 times the uncertainty. Hmm, no, 1e-8 is 1e-8, and the uncertainty is about 3.3e-7, which is 3.3e-7 = 3.3e-7 eV. So 1e-8 is smaller than that.

So the only option that's larger than 3.3e-7 eV is option C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation for ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt).

But wait, wait: ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. Because 1 eV·s is a common unit when dealing with ħ in these contexts.

Because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ħ in eV·s is:

ħ = 1.
