Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries all operators must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincaré, CP, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, I remember from my studies that the SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But which ones exactly? I think that the SMEFT is based on the Standard Model, so it should preserve the same symmetries as the SM.

Let's break down each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT operators must also preserve this. Otherwise, the theory wouldn't be consistent with relativity.

2. Poincaré Symmetry: Poincaré includes Lorentz and translation symmetries. Since the SM includes Poincaré, SMEFT would too. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, right? So maybe it's automatically built to respect Poincaré because that's part of the framework.

3. CP Symmetry: The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, CP violation is observed in certain processes like kaon and B-meson systems. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, SMEFT shouldn't enforce it either. So operators in SMEFT might violate CP, but do they have to respect it? I don't think so. So CP isn't a must-respect symmetry.

4. CPT Symmetry: I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because of the way Lorentz transformations and the inner product of states work, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. So SMEFT operators must respect CPT.

So putting it together: Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected, as must CPT (4). Poincaré (2) is a larger symmetry including Lorentz and translations. Since the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect Poincaré as well. Wait, but is SMEFT automatically Poincaré invariant because it's part of the framework, or do the operators have to individually respect it? Since the operators are part of the theory, their inclusion should ensure Poincaré is preserved. So Poincaré symmetry (2) is also required.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must be Poincaré-invariant? Or does the theory as a whole just have Poincaré symmetry?

Hmm. For SMEFT, the operators are built respecting the symmetries of the SM, which includes Poincaré. So the operators themselves are constructed to be Poincaré-invariant. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry, Lorentz symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Wait, but what about CP? Because the SM doesn't have CP, so operators can violate it.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be "respected" by all operators. So if the theory as a whole doesn't have a symmetry, individual operators don't have to respect it. So operators can violate CP, but what about CPT? I thought CPT must be a symmetry because it's part of Lorentz symmetry. If the theory respects Lorentz, then it's automatically respecting CPT
