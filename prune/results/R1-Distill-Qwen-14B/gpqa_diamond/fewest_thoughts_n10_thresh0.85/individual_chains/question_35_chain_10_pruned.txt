Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Let me try to unpack it. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum operators, but I'll think it through.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is c multiplied by S. c is h/(4π), right? And S is given as a matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So I can write S as:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

So A_y is c * S. Let's compute that. Since c is h/(4π), A_y becomes (h/(4π)) * S. So the matrix A_y is:

A_y = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
         [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Wait, but I'm not sure if I need to write it out right away. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y, and which of the statements is correct.

Eigenvalues of A_y satisfy the equation det(A_y - a I) = 0. Let me write that determinant equation. The matrix (A_y - a I) would be:

[ -a, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ].

Wait, let me compute that. The product of the off-diagonal terms: (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) (h^2)/(16 π²). What's (-i)(i)? That's (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So the product is (h²)/(16 π²). So the determinant is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So solving a² = (h^2)/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π). Wait, so the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. Wait, but why? Because A_y is a Hermitian matrix? Or is it?

Wait, S is a 2x2 matrix. Let me check if S is Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. S's conjugate transpose would be swapping the signs of the imaginary parts. The original S has [0, -i; i, 0]. Its conjugate transpose would be [0, i; -i, 0], which is not the same as S. So S is anti-Hermitian, maybe? Wait, because S† = -S. Let me see: S's conjugate transpose is:

[ 0 , i ]
[ -i, 0 ]

Which is -S. So S is anti-Hermitian. So when I multiply by c, which is h/(4π), which is real, then A_y is c * S. So A_y is anti-Hermitian because (A_y)† = c S† = c (-S) = -c S = -A_y. So A_y is anti-Hermitian. Anti-Hermitian operators have eigenvalues that are purely imaginary, right? Because if (A_y)† = -A_y, then for an eigenvector φ with eigenvalue a, A_y φ = a φ. Taking the conjugate, φ† A_y† = a* φ†. But A_y† = -A_y, so φ† (-A_y) = a* φ†. So - (A_y φ† )† = a* φ† → - ( (a φ)† ) = a* φ† → - (a* φ† ) = a* φ† → so -a* = a* → so a* = -a*. Which implies a is purely imaginary. So the eigenvalues of A_y should be purely imaginary.

Wait, but earlier I found that a² = (h/(4π))² → a = ± h/(4π). But that would make a real numbers, not imaginary. Hmm, that's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in calculating the eigenvalues.

Wait, wait, let's go back. The matrix A_y is [ [0, -i c], [i c, 0] ], where c is h/(4π). So the determinant equation is a² - (c^2) = 0. Because the off-diagonal terms when multiplied give (i c)( -i c) = (i)(-i) c² = (1) c². So the determinant is a² - c² = 0 → a = ± c. So eigenvalues are plus and minus c. But wait, since A_y is anti-Hermitian, the eigenvalues should be purely imaginary. So this suggests that a is imaginary. But c is h/(4π), a real number. So this is a problem.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The matrix S is given, and the operator is A_y = c S. So perhaps S isn't Hermitian but another kind of matrix. Let me compute S. The matrix S is:

0  -i
i   0

So S is a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute S^†, the conjugate transpose of S. The (1,2) element is -i → conjugate is i, so S† would be:

0   i
- i 0

Which is equal to negative S, because S is:

0  -i
i   0

So S† = -S. Therefore, S is anti-Hermitian. So A_y = c S is also anti-Hermitian since c is real.

But then the eigenvalues should be imaginary. So the equation a² = c² → a = ± c → but that would make a real. So this seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant calculation. Let me recompute.

The matrix A_y is:

[ 0          -i c ]
[ i c        0   ]

So the eigenvalues are found by det(A_y - a I) = 0.

So the matrix is:

[ -a        -i c ]
[ i c       -a   ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) → a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (-i^2) c² = (-(-1)) c² = c². So the determinant is a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ± c.

But if A_y is anti-Hermitian, then a must be imaginary. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the operator is actually Hermitian, not anti-Hermitian. Did I make a mistake in the S matrix? Let me think: S is given as [0, -i; i, 0]. Its conjugate transpose is [0, i; -i, 0], which is the same as -S. So S is anti-Hermitian.

But wait, angular momentum operators are Hermitian, as observables. So perhaps there's a miscalculation. Oh wait, the operator A is the intrinsic angular momentum, which is given by ħ times the spin matrices. Spin matrices are Hermitian. So perhaps I made a mistake in defining S.

Wait, perhaps the matrix S is actually the Pauli matrices, which are Hermitian. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Oh wait, σ_y is:

[0  -i]
[i  0]

Which is the same as the matrix S given here. And σ_y is Hermitian. Wait, wait, let me check: σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose is the same as itself? Let's compute.

Conjugate of 0 is 0. Conjugate of -i is i. So the first row of S† is [0, i]. Second row: the conjugate of i is -i, and 0 is 0. So S† would be:

[0   i]
[-i  0]

Compare to S:

[0  -i]
[i  0]

So S† is not equal to S. So σ_y is not Hermitian. Wait, no, wait again. The conjugate transpose of σ_y should be σ_y^†. Let me compute:

σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

σ_y^† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is the same as -σ_y, because:

-σ_y = [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Ah, so yes, σ_y is anti-Hermitian? But that's not right because I remember that the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the notation.

Wait, no, the Pauli matrices
