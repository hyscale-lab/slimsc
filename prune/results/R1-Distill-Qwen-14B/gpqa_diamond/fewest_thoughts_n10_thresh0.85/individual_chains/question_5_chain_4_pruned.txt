Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. So the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

The operator P is broken down into its components: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these components is given as ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along direction n.

Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for a component along an arbitrary direction is a combination of the x, y, and z components. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the vector can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think. Oh wait, no, wait. In spherical coordinates, the direction vector would have components (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, that means the y-component is zero. So φ would be 0 or π, depending on the direction. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right?

So the operator P along direction n is given by the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices, scaled by ħ/2. So P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). But since n is in x-z, n_y is zero, so P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, let me write down the components. The given components are:

Px: (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py: (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz: (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So P would be (sinθ)(Px) + (cosθ)(Pz). Let me compute that.

So P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix. 

First, sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]].
Then cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]].
Adding these two matrices together:

The (1,1) element is cosθ.
The (1,2) element is sinθ.
The (2,1) element is sinθ.
The (2,2) element is -cosθ.

So P is (ħ/2) times the matrix:
[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Yes, because the diagonal elements are cosθ and -cosθ, and the off-diagonal are sinθ and sinθ.

So the matrix for operator P (after including the ħ/2 factor) is:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

We need to
