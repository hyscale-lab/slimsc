Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, so the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, but wait, no, more accurately, plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/(d), where d is the distance in parsecs.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then substituting that in, N would be proportional to (d)^5 because (1/plx) is d, so (d)^5. Wait, let me double-check. If plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So 1/plx^5 is (d)^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. 

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, wait, per unit range of distance r. Wait, distance is a continuous variable, so when we talk about the number of stars per unit distance, that would be the differential of N with respect to d.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dd is proportional to 5d^4. But wait, the options are in terms of
