Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull as it orbits the star. 

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms in the spectral line. Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. 

Hmm, I think the key here is understanding how the RV method relates the observed Doppler shift to the planet's orbital period. From what I recall, the Doppler shift (or the semi-amplitude of the velocity) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. 

The formula I remember is something like K = (v * sin i) where v is the velocity semi-amplitude. But wait, the actual formula for K involves the mass of the planet and the star's mass. Let me try to write it down. 

The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/3) or something like that. Maybe I should think in terms of the relationship between the semi-amplitude and the orbital period. 

Wait, I think I can approach this by considering the ratio of the velocities first. Because K (the semi-amplitude) is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / P)^(1/3). Or wait, is it the other way around? Let me think. 

No, wait. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * ( (P / (2π)) )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ something). Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1) )^(1/3) * (P)^(−1/3). Hmm, perhaps I should look for a more straightforward approach.

Wait, maybe I can relate the two planets since their host stars are the same mass, and their planet masses are similar (Neptune-like, so same M_p). So, for both, M_p and M_star are the same. So the formula for K would be proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)), because K = (some constant) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ). 

Wait, let me get the exact formula. I think the formula is:

K = [ (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ] / [ c * (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ]

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is much less than Sun), M_star + M
