Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. Higher β means the complex is more stable. 

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all Co species. 

Wait, what's the structure here? I think Co can form complexes with SCN- in different coordination numbers. The blue complex is probably Co(SCN)_n^m, but which n? I remember Co can form complexes like Co(SCN)_x. The dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ligands, so maybe it's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. But I'm not exactly sure which β corresponds to which complex.

Wait, the β values are for different levels of complexation. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So β1=9 must be the first complex, which is maybe Co(SCN). And β2=40 is the next, so Co(SCN)_2, etc. But wait, the order of β matters because higher β means more stable.

So the complexes are in order of increasing stability based on β. But wait, β3 is 63, which is higher than β2's 40. So the third complex is more stable than the second? Or wait, no, the stability constants are for each step. So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n would be the product of the β's up to that n. 

Wait no, wait. The stepwise formation constants are β1, β2, etc. So for the first complex, Co(SCN)^(+), it's β1 = [Co(SCN)]+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]). Then β2 is for the next step: [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ / ([Co(SCN)]+ [SCN^-]). So the overall formation constant for the second complex would be β1 * β2. Similarly, for the third complex, it's β1*β2*β3, and so on.

So the hierarchy of the overall K values (formation constants) would be:

K1 = β1 =9,

K2 = β1*β2=9*40=360,

K3=β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680,

K4=β1*β2*β3*β4=22680 *16=362880.

So the most stable is the fourth complex, but wait, what's the question again? Oh right, we're looking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. So that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the second complex, with K2=360.

Wait, but wait, I thought the dithiocyanato complex is maybe the third one? Or perhaps it's the first one. I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Cobalt can form different colored complexes. The blue color is often associated with the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ complexes. The most common ones I remember are the hexadentate ones, like [Co(SCN)_6]^3− but that's with six SCN- ligands. But the question says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN-.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the one with four SCN- ligands. Wait, I'm not entirely sure. But the problem states that the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, so I think it's the complex with two SCN- ligands. So that would be the second complex, which has K2=360.

So the possible complexes present are:

1. Co²+,

2. Co(SCN)²+,

3. Co(SCN)_2^2+,

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the complexes are Co(SCN)^+ (n=1), Co(SCN)_2^2+ (n=2), Co(SCN)_3^3+ (n=3), Co(SCN)_4^4+ (n=4). 

Wait, so the solution includes all possible species of Co with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 SCN- ligands. So the possible species are Co²+, Co(SCN)²+ (n=1), Co(SCN)_2^2+ (n=2?), no, wait n is the number of ligands. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the first complex would be CoSCN^+ (n=1, charge +1?), but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The formation steps:

Co²+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)²+ (n=1), K1=β1=9.

Then, Co(SCN)²+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^3+ (n=2), K2=β2=40. Wait, no, because each β is the stepwise constant. So β1 is the first step, β2 is the second, etc. So the overall K for the first complex is β1=9, for the second complex it's β1*β2=9*40=360, for the third, 9*40*63=22680, and for the fourth, 9*40*63*16=362880.

So the species present are Co²+, CoSCN^+, Co(SCN)_2^2+, Co(SCN)_3^3+, Co(SCN)_4^4+.

Wait, actually, the charges would be: Co²+ is 2+. Each SCN- is -1. So for the first complex, CoSCN^+ would be Co²+ + SCN^- → charge is 2+ + (-1) = +1? Or CoSCN^+? Hmm. Maybe not, but perhaps the way they're presented is correct.

But regardless, the main point is that each step adds another SCN- ligand, with each β being the stepwise formation constant.

So the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Assuming that's the complex with two SCN- ligands, which would be the second step, so species is Co(SCN)_2^2+.

But wait, what if the blue complex is actually the third one, with three SCN-? I'm not entirely sure, but the question says dithiocyanato, which implies two SCN- groups. So perhaps it's the second complex.

So, our goal is to find the fraction (or mole fraction) of Co(SCN)_2^2+ among all Co species.

To find this, we need to consider the distribution of Co among all possible complexes. Since the problem gives us the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN^-, we can model the formation of these complexes.

But wait, Co²+ can form complexes with SCN- up to n=4. So each step adds another SCN-.

The approach is to use the formation constants to calculate the fraction of each species.

Let me think about the general approach. The fraction of each complex can be found using the stepwise formation constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The problem is to calculate the fraction of each Co species, then sum them, and find the percentage of the desired species.

Since the formation constants are given, and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN^- are known, we can model the distribution.

But how to approach this? The problem is that each complex formation depends on the availability of free SCN-.

But perhaps we can make an assumption that the concentration of free SCN- is approximately 0.1 M, which is given. Because when the formation constants are high, the ligand gets consumed, but with β4=16, which is lower than the earlier βs, maybe the higher complexes aren't that prevalent.

Alternatively, perhaps treating the concentration of SCN- as a constant (0.1 M) is acceptable because it's in large excess compared to Co²+.

Wait, the initial [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and [Co] is 1e-2 M. So SCN is in excess. So perhaps we can approximate [SCN^-] as 0.1 M throughout the calculations because the amount that gets consumed is negligible. That would simplify the calculations.

So, let's proceed under that assumption.

The general approach is to model each complex step by step.

The fraction f_n of each complex can be given by the expression:

f_n = ( [Co(SCN)_n^(charge) ] ) / ( [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)^(+)] + [Co(SCN)_2^2+] + [Co(SCN)_3^3+] + [Co(SCN)_4^4+] )

We can write expressions for each [Co(SCN)_n] in terms of [Co²+] and the formation constants.

The standard approach is to express each concentration in terms of the free Co²+ concentration.

Let me denote [Co²+] as x. Then,

[Co(SCN)] = β1 * x * [SCN] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x 

[Co(SCN)_2] = β1 * β2 * x * [SCN]^2 = 9 *40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 360 x * 0.01 = 3.6 x 

[Co(SCN)_3] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3 = 9*40*63 x (0.1)^3 = 22680 x * 0.001 = 22.68 x 

[Co(SCN)_4] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4 = 9*40*63*16 x (0.1)^4 = 362880 x * 0.0001 = 36.288 x 

Wait, but wait: each step adds a ligand, so I think the expressions are built cumulatively.

Wait, [Co(SCN)] = β1 [Co²+][SCN^-]
[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co(SCN)] [SCN^-] = β1 β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 
[Co(SCN)_3] = β3 [Co(SCN)_2][SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 [Co²+][SCN^-]^3 
And so on.

So the expressions I wrote are correct.

So, all the concentrations of the complexes are proportional to [Co²+] multiplied by the product of the βs and [SCN] raised to the n-1 power (for n=1,2,3,4).

Wait, no. For Co(SCN)_n, it's [Co²+] * [SCN^-]^{n} multiplied by the product of β1 to βn.

So,

[Co(SCN)_n] = (β1 β2 ...βn) x [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n

Wait, no, because each step adds a β. So for n=1, it's β1 x [Co²+][SCN^-].

For n=2, it's β1 β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2.

Yes, that's correct.

So the terms are:

[Co²+] = x

[CoSCN^+] = 9 x (0.1) = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)_2^2+] = 9 *40 x (0.1)^2 = 360 x *0.01 = 3.6 x

[Co(SCN)_3^3+] = 9*40*63 x (0.1)^3 = 22680 x *0.001=22.68 x

[Co(SCN)_4^4+] =9*40*63*16 x (0.1)^4=362880 x *0.0001=36.288 x.

So the total concentration of all Co species is x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = (1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 ) x = sum of all terms.

Calculating that:

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So the total is 64.468 x.

But wait, the initial concentration of Co is 1e-2 M. But in solution, the sum of all Co species should equal that.

Wait, the initial Co concentration is 1e-2 M. So the sum of all the species should be 1e-2 M.

But wait, we denoted [Co²+] as x. So the sum of all the
