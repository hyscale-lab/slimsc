Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. Okay, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a minute, in quantum mechanics, the wave function usually is a complex number, but the modulus squared gives the probability density. Oh right, the wave function should have the form ψ(x) = something real plus something imaginary, but the important thing is that the probability density is |ψ(x)|².

Wait, the problem states that when they measured the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero (or at least the probability density zero) outside this interval. Because the particle was never found in x <1 or x>3, the wave function must be zero there. So I think the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right because for the wave function to be zero outside 1 to 3, I think the function should be zero outside that range, but the given function doesn't seem to have that condition. Oh wait, perhaps the wave function is given only in the region where it exists, i.e., between x=1 and x=3. So outside this region, the wave function is zero, and inside this region, it's as given.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But that's a constant imaginary term. Oh wait, so if this is the wave function, then the modulus squared is |ψ|² = (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2. Because if ψ is A + iB, then |ψ|² is A² + B².

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But in quantum mechanics, the integral of |ψ|² over all space must be 1, because the total probability is 1. So to find 'a', we need to normalize the wave function.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the wave function exists only between x=1 and x=3, and is zero elsewhere. So the integral of |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3 must be 1.

Wait, wait a second. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But if that's only in the region where the particle exists, then the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but if that's the case, then maybe the wave function is not properly normalized as given. Because the normalization condition is the integral of |ψ|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

So the integral of |ψ|² is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx.

Wait, that's the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx plus the integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part separately.

First, the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So this becomes a² [ ln(1+x) ] from 1 to 3.

So a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2), since ln(4) is 2 ln(2), and ln(2) is from 2 -1? Wait, no, wait, ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2 ln(2), and ln(2) is ln(2). So the difference is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first part is a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25 times (3-1), which is 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5.

But this must equal 1, because the total probability is 1. So:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculating ln(2), which is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking the square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a minute. Could I have made a mistake here? Let me double-check.

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So integrating from 1 to 3:

Integral [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = a² ln(2) + 0.5*(3-1) = a² ln(2) + 0.5.

Set this equal to 1:

a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ 0.849, which rounds to 0.85.

So the correct answer is B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition for wave functions in quantum mechanics: the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over all space must equal 1. The problem specifies that the particle exists only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), so \( \psi(x) \) is zero outside this interval.

The wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), where the real part is \( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \) and the imaginary part is \( -0.5 \). The probability density is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \):  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Thus:
   \[
   a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \):  
   This is straightforward:
   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
