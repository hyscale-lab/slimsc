Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for operators. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this often correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when measured along that direction.

So, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me jot down each component matrix.

First, P_x is (ħ/2) times:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

Then, P_y is (ħ/2) times:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

And P_z is (ħ/2) times:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, -1] ]

Wait, but the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because it's in the x-z plane, meaning the y-component is zero. Or wait, maybe it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Because usually, θ is measured from the z-axis. So direction n is along the x-z plane, so it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if θ is from the z-axis. Hmm, maybe I should think about the general form of the operator when it's along an arbitrary direction.

I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the operator for spin along a direction n is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices multiplied by the components of n. So the operator P would be something like P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But in this case, since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Wait, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, σ_y is Pauli Y, and σ_z is Pauli Z. So our given P_x, P_y, P_z are each (ħ/2) times these matrices. So the general operator P is a linear combination of these.

So, let me write P as:
P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)
But n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Since n lies in x-z plane, n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let's say n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ? Wait, no, because in spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the positive z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is around the z-axis. Since n is in the x-z plane, φ is 0, so n_x is cosθ and n_z is sinθ. Wait, no: wait, cosθ would be the z-component when θ is the polar angle. So maybe n_x = sinθ cosφ, but since φ is 0, n_x = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ? Because when φ=0, the direction is along x-z plane. So for n, the components are (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Yes, that makes sense because when θ=0, we're along z, and θ=90 degrees, along x.

But wait, the problem says n is an arbitrary direction in x-z plane. So n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ, where θ is the angle from z-axis, right?

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. If θ is the angle from the z-axis, then the position vector in spherical coordinates is (r, θ, φ). So in x-z plane, φ=0. So the components would be x = r sinθ cosφ = r sinθ (since φ=0), and z = r cosθ. So in our case, since n is a unit vector, r=1. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, substituting into the operator P:
P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * σ_x + cosθ * σ_z ]

So σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting these matrices:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute this matrix:

First, sinθ * σ_x:
[ [0, sinθ],
  [sinθ, 0] ]

Plus cosθ * σ_z:
[ [cosθ, 0],
  [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding them gives:
[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So P is (ħ/2) times this matrix:
P = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ],
              [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

Let me write the eigenvector as a column vector [a; b].

So, substituting into the matrix equation:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to eliminate the factor:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

So, the equation becomes:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a  
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

So let's write these two equations:

1. cosθ a + sinθ b = a  
2. sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0  
Similarly equation 2:

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Hmm, so I have a homogeneous system of equations. To find non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients matrix must be zero. But alternatively, since the spin-1/2 system is two-level, the eigenvectors should be non-zero vectors, so the system should have a non-trivial solution.

But perhaps it's easier to find the ratio of a and b.

Let's take equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0  
=> (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b  
=> a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Wait, but 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So let's see:

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ]  
= [cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2)]  
= cot(θ/2 )

So a = cot(θ/2) b  
Which implies that a = [cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] b  
So a = [cot(θ/2)] b

Alternatively, we can write a = (1/tan(θ/2)) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = [ cot(θ/2) b; b ] = b [ cot(θ/2); 1 ]

But we can factor out b, and express the eigenvector as proportional to [cot(θ/2), 1]^T.

Alternatively, we can choose b=1 to get a vector [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But wait, let me check equation 2 as well. Let me substitute a = cot(θ/2) b into equation 2.

Equation 2: sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

Substitute a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b = cot(θ/2) b

So equation 2 becomes:

sinθ * cot(θ/2) b - (cosθ +1) b = 0  
Factor out b: [ sinθ cot(θ/2) - (cosθ +1) ] = 0

Let's compute sinθ cot(θ/2):

We know that cot(θ/2) = (1 + cosθ)/sinθ  
So sinθ * cot(θ/2) = sinθ * (1 + cosθ)/sinθ = 1 + cosθ

So equation 2 becomes (1+cosθ) - (cosθ +1) ) b = 0  
Which simplifies to 0 = 0. So equation 2 doesn't add any new information. Thus, the first equation gives the condition.

So the eigenvector is in the direction of [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But we can also express this in terms of sine and cosine. Let me think about this.

Let me factor out 1/sin(θ/2) from the vector [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

Cot(θ/2) is cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2). So [ cot(θ/2), 1 ] = [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), 1 ] = (1/sin(θ/2)) [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Wait, because 1 = sin(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), so it's 1/sin(θ/2) * [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

So the eigenvector can be written as proportional to [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, let's check the normalization. The vector [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] has a length of sqrt( cos² + sin² ) = 1, so it's already normalized.

Therefore, the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the question is about the normalized eigenvector. So the components are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2), but scaled by some factors perhaps.

Wait, but in the options, I see some options with hbar factors. Wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would match our conclusion. But wait, the question says the eigenvector is for the operator P, which has eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: the general eigenvector might involve a phase factor, especially because the spin-1/2 system is two-level, and the eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple (including complex phases). But in our case, the matrix P is Hermitian because it's an observable (since it's a component of angular momentum operator), so its eigenvectors should be real? Wait, no, because the components P_x and P_y are Hermitian only when multiplied by real coefficients. Oh wait, wait, let me think.

Wait, the operator P is (ħ/2) times a real matrix because n is in x-z plane, so sinθ and cosθ are real. So the matrix P is Hermitian, which means the eigenvectors should be real or come in complex conjugate pairs.

Wait, but in our earlier steps, the eigenvector came out real, because all the terms were real. So the eigenvector is real, [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, looking at the other options:

Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2) and sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2). But why would they have hbar in the components? Because eigenvectors are dimensionless, right? Because vectors in quantum mechanics are usually in a Hilbert space which is normalized. So the presence of ħ in the options is confusing.

Wait, the question says: "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So the eigenvector is a vector, say |v> = [a, b]^T, and it's normalized, so sqrt(|a|^2 +|b|^2) =1.

In our case, [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is normalized, so the components are just these.

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But another option, option D: components with sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2) and sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2). But that would imply that the components have units of ħ, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the operator. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvalue equation is (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So substituting P as (ħ/2) times the matrix [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

Then, P - (ħ/2) I is (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ].

So the matrix becomes:

[ (cosθ - 1) * (ħ/2), sinθ * (ħ/2) ]
[ sinθ * (ħ/2), (-cosθ -1) * (ħ/2) ]

But when setting up the equation (P - λI) |v> =0, with λ= ħ/2, so the matrix is (ħ/2) times the matrix [ [cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ-1] ].

But when doing this, to find the eigenvectors, we can factor out (ħ/2) from each row, which doesn't affect the kernel (null space).

So, the system becomes:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0  
sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0

Which is what I had earlier. So the same solution as before.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ), 1 ].

Wait, but 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So:

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin²(theta/2)] ]  
= [cos(theta/2)] / [ sin(theta/2) ]

Which is cot(theta/2), as before.

So the vector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But we can write this as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by 1/sin(theta/2), which gives [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But wait, [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is a unit vector, so that's the normalized eigenvector.

So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So that's option C.

Wait, but option C is written as (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but in our case, the eigenvector is real, so phi would be zero. Or perhaps the problem allows the eigenvector to have a phase factor. Hmm.

Wait, no, the problem says "the normalized eigenvector", but in quantum mechanics, the global phase doesn't matter. So any multiple by e^{i phi} would be equivalent, but the eigenvectors are defined up to a global phase.

But in our case, the eigenvector came out real and positive. So the actual normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking back at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).

But if phi is arbitrary, then this is correct because any phase factor can be applied. Wait, but the question states that the operator is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, which is specified by theta and phi=0. So perhaps in this case, the eigenvector is real.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator is along an arbitrary direction, but the eigenvector may have a phase factor. Hmm, but the direction lies in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So the eigenvector should have real components if the operator is Hermitian.

Wait, but P is Hermitian because it's (ħ/2) times a Hermitian matrix. So its eigenvectors should be real (or complex but in conjugate pairs). But in our case, the eigenvector is real.

So the correct eigenvector components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

But wait, looking again at option C: it's (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)). So this suggests a phase factor. But given that the direction is in the x-z plane and the operator is Hermitian, the eigenvector should be real, so phi would be zero. But the problem states that the direction is arbitrary, so perhaps the eigenvector can have a phase factor, but that's not relevant for the components in the x-z plane.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the eigenvectors are real. Let me think again.

The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so P is Hermitian. So the eigenstates must be real, because for Hermitian matrices, the eigenvalues are real, and eigenstates can be chosen to be real vectors.

Wait, but in two-level systems, the eigenvectors can be complex, but the real and imaginary parts are orthogonal.

Wait, no, for a 2x2 Hermitian matrix, the eigenvectors can be chosen as real. Because any Hermitian matrix is diagonalizable by a real orthogonal matrix, so the eigenvectors can be chosen real.

So in our case, the eigenvector is real: [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the correct option is option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).

So, the first component is real, but the second has a phase factor. Since in our case, the vector is real, phi would be zero. So the option is correct if we set phi=0.

Another option is option D: ( sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

But wait, the eigenvector is normalized, which would mean the sum of squares is 1. So let's compute the sum for option D:

( [ sqrt(2/3) ħ ]^2 + [ sqrt(1/3) ħ ]^2 ) = ( (2/3) ħ² + (1/3) ħ² ) = ħ². So unless ħ is 1, this isn't normalized. But the question says the vector is normalized, so option D is not normalized unless ħ=1, which isn't stated.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization. Let me recompute the eigenvector.

Wait, earlier, I found that the eigenvector components are [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]. So the sum of squares is 1, which is correct.

Looking again at the options, option C matches this.

But wait, looking back, perhaps I miscalculated the eigenvector. Let me go through the steps again.

The operator is P = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

We need to find eigenvectors for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the matrix equation is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] [ a; b ] = [ a; b ]

Which leads to:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a  
sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Rearranging the first equation: (cosθ -1 ) a + sinθ b =0  
Second equation: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1 ) b = 0

Let me write this as:

( (cosθ -1 ) ) a + ( sinθ ) b = 0  
( sinθ ) a + ( (-cosθ -1) ) b = 0

The determinant of the coefficient matrix should be zero since we're looking for non-trivial solutions:

| (cosθ -1)    sinθ       |
| sinθ         (-cosθ -1) |

Determinant = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ)

Let me compute this:

= [ ( -cos²θ -cosθ + cosθ + 1 ) ] - sin²θ  
= [ (-cos²θ + 1 ) ] - sin²θ  
But 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ, so:

= sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

So determinant is zero, which confirms that there's a non-trivial solution.

So from the first equation: (cosθ -1 ) a + sinθ b =0  
=> (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b  
=> a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Again, sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = cot(theta/2). So a = cot(theta/2) b.

So the eigenvector is [ a; b ] = [ cot(theta/2) b; b ] = b [ cot(theta/2); 1 ]

To normalize, |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So (cot²(theta/2) + 1 ) |b|^2 =1.

But cot²(theta/2) +1 = csc²(theta/2) = 1/sin²(theta/2).

So |b|² = sin²(theta/2)  
=> |b| = | sin(theta/2) |  
Assuming sin(theta/2) is positive, which it is for 0 < theta < 2pi.

So b = sin(theta/2), a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Thus, the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where $\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$. Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the operator becomes:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
P |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]

where $|v\rangle$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $P$ into the eigenvalue equation and solving for the eigenvector, we find that the eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
|v\rangle \propto \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we verify that the components $\cos(\theta/2)$ and $\sin(\theta/2)$ already satisfy the normalization condition:

\[
\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1.
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This option is incorrect because the components are not proportional to $\cos(\theta/2)$ and $\sin(\theta/2)$, and the presence of $\hbar$ in the components is inconsistent with the normalization of eigenvectors, which are dimensionless.

- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$  
  This option is incorrect because the components do not match the derived eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This option is correct, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This option is incorrect because the presence of $\hbar$ in the components is inconsistent with the normalization of eigenvectors, which are dimensionless.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.  

Answer: C
