Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down what the question says.

The first part involves heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably via an E2 mechanism. This would form an alkene. So, the product here, product 1, should be an adamantane derivative with a double bond where the two bromines were.

The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But wait, product 1 was formed by elimination of HBr from a dihalide, which should form an alkene. Hmm, unless there's some oxidation happening, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Maybe I'm mixing up something here. Oh wait, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide adjacent (vicinal), so elimination would form an alkene, but why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the first step. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but the IR says 1720 which is more of a carbonyl. Unless I'm missing something—maybe the KOH isn't acting as a base but as a nucleophile? No, wait, for elimination, KOH acts as a base. But then why the IR? Oh, wait, maybe product 1 isn't the alkene. Another possibility: maybe the dihalide is undergoing substitution. Since KOH is a strong base, maybe it's a SN2 substitution. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bridged structure, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the central bridgehead positions are probably not good for SN2 because of poor leaving group accessibility. So elimination is more likely, forming an alkene.

Wait, but then why the IR shows a carbonyl? That doesn't fit. Maybe I made a mistake. Oh, wait, product 1 is a light yellow solid after heating. Alkenes might be more solid but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide? No, that would require an oxygen source. Or perhaps it's a diol? But KOH wouldn't do that on its own. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides react with KOH, sometimes they can form epoxides if they have adjacent X's, but wait, that's if there's an acidic hydrogen. Oh wait, no, epoxide formation typically involves an elimination with a base, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alkene, and the IR is referring to some other group. Wait, maybe the initial product is an alkyne? But I don't think KOH would produce an alkyne. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone or ester, but I don't see how that forms from elimination.

Wait, maybe I should look at the NMR data. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm integrating to 2H. That's a region typical for CH2 groups adjacent to an oxygen, like ethers or epoxides. Alternatively, it could be a methylene next to an electronegative atom. The 1.94 ppm peak is 2H. Maybe a CH2 group near the bridgehead. But wait, the IR shows 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (like a ketone or ester). So maybe the product is a ketone. How?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the dihalide is being dehydrohalogenated to form a carbonyl. Oh, wait, if two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and elimination occurs, perhaps it's forming a carbonyl group. Like if the two CH2Br groups eliminate HBr and form a double bond, but that wouldn't form a carbonyl. Unless it's a vicinal dihalide that rearranges. Wait, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation leading to a conjugated diene, but that wouldn't account for the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't 1,3-dibromoadamantane but a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not elimination but oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Another thought: Maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH in a way that forms a ketone via some elimination and decomposition. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: The IR peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. How can that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where two KOHs substitute two bromines, leading to a diol. But that doesn't form a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs followed by some rearrangement.

Wait, maybe it's an example of the formation of an epoxide via a dihalide, but I don't think that's right. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination with two equivalents of KOH to form a ketone. Wait, for that, perhaps the two Br groups are on adjacent carbons, each losing H and Br, forming a double bond, but how would that form a carbonyl? Maybe if the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl. Oh, wait! If the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, maybe the elimination forms a bridgehead double bond, but then that's not a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening. Wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromobicyclo[2.2.2]octane (adamantane), and KOH is used, maybe it's forming a ketone via a ring-opening elimination. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I'm misremembering the reaction. I think when 1,2-dibromoethane reacts with KOH, it forms ethylene. But in adamantane, maybe the structure's symmetry leads to a different product. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone because of a neighboring group effect. Wait, if the dihalide is on bridgehead carbons, elimination could form a bridgehead double bond, which is not possible in adamantane because of the structure. Oh wait, adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so maybe the bridgehead positions can't support a double bond. So elimination would not form a double bond but perhaps form a carbonyl instead. How?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl via some kind of keto-enol tautomerism. But I'm not sure how that would proceed. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is converted into a carbonyl via a two-step elimination, each E2 step removing a Br and a H, leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, another angle: What if the product is not from elimination but from substitution. But vicinal dihalides under basic conditions usually eliminate, not substitute, unless in a very hindered environment. Hmm, maybe in this case, the structure is so hindered that substitution is not feasible, leading to elimination.

But then, how does the IR show a carbonyl? I must be missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the product is a diol, but that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but that would have a different IR peak, around 1200 cm^-1 for the epoxide group.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. How could that happen? If the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, each Br leaves, and two H's are abstracted, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, that would require the two adjacent carbons each losing a Br and a H, leading to a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone. So I'm stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR is indicating a carbonyl in product 1, which is the alkene. But I don't think alkenes have a C=O stretch. So maybe my initial assumption about product 1 is incorrect. Let me think of the NMR data again.

The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's usually indicative of a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. For example, in an epoxide, the CH2 groups next to the oxygen would appear around 3.5-4.5 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom like O or N. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2Cl or something, but with KOH, Cl wouldn't be present.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a diol. After elimination, but that doesn't explain the IR. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ether. But diols don't have ethers. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution, not elimination. Since KOH is a strong base, but in a hindered environment, maybe substitution occurs. However, 1,3-dibromoadamantane's structure is such that substitution would be difficult because the leaving groups are at bridgehead positions, which are not typically good for SN2 reactions due to poor backside attack. So perhaps elimination is the main pathway, leading to an alkene. But then why the IR?

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the IR. 1720 cm^-1 could also be a C=C stretch, but that's usually around 1600-1680. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group from another part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule has both a carbonyl and an alkene, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the product 1 isn't from the dihalide but from some other reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But how? From a dihalide and KOH? I'm not sure.

Since I'm stuck on product 1, let's move on to the next step and see if that helps. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, adamantane derivatives are polycyclic hydrocarbons, so maybe product 1 has an electron-rich ring that can undergo some kind of electrophilic substitution. But product 1 was formed from KOH, which is a base. So if product 1 is an alkene, maybe it's an diene or something that can undergo some addition.

Wait, product 1's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Because in epoxides, the CH2 groups next to the oxygen typically appear around 3-4 ppm. Wait, 4.79 is a bit high, but perhaps if the epoxide is part of a rigid structure, the chemical shift is upfield. Alternatively, maybe the peak is for an OCH2 group. But in an epoxide, each CH2 would be adjacent to two O's, but in this case, perhaps it's a bridgehead epoxide.

Wait, but how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane form an epoxide upon treatment with KOH? I'm not certain, but maybe the base induces an elimination to form an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxide formation usually involves an acid catalyst, not a base. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkyne. But I don't see how KOH would produce an alkyne from a dihalide.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about product 1's structure based on the NMR and IR. The IR has a strong peak at 1720, which is a C=O stretch. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm, integrating to 2H. That might be two equivalent protons adjacent to an oxygen. So perhaps a ketone with a CH2 group next to it. For example, if the structure is something like (CH2)2CO in a bridged system.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone. Wait, perhaps the product is an cyclopropane ring with a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial step forms an epoxide, but that doesn't fit with the IR data. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone. But how? From elimination of two bromides, maybe the structure forms two ketones. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a geminal diol, but that would require substitution at the same carbon, which is unlikely with vicinal dihalide and KOH.

Hmm, I'm stuck on product 1, but perhaps I can proceed and see if the next steps shed light.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. As I thought earlier, aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, used for Friedel-Crafts. So perhaps product 1 is an arene with a carbonyl group. Wait, but adamantane is a polycyclic hydrocarbon; adding a carbonyl group might make it more reactive towards electrophilic substitution.

Wait, let's imagine product 1 has a ketone group. Then, product 2 might be the result of a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But where would the electrophile come from? Aluminum isopropoxide could help generate an acylium ion, perhaps. But I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and aluminum isopropoxide is used in some diene reaction, but that's not something I recall.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a diol, and when heated with aluminum isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of dehydration to form a carbonyl group. But that would require a diol that can lose water to form a ketone or aldehyde, which would match the IR.

Wait, if product 1 is a diol, and in the next step, it's heated with a Lewis acid catalyst, perhaps it undergoes an elimination reaction to form a carbonyl. So product 2 would have a carbonyl group.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and heating with aluminum isopropoxide causes it to open. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and heating with aluminum isopropoxide leads to addition reactions. For example, maybe it adds something across the double bond.

Wait, but product 1's NMR doesn't show any peaks in the alkene region (around 5-6 ppm), unless the 4.79 ppm is from something else.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ether, and the next step is some kind of elimination.

I think I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should think about product 3 and the NMR data.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide (which is a reductive work-up, giving aldehydes or ketones without breaking more bonds than necessary). So product 3 is the ozonolysis product of product 2.

In the 1H NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen's coupling pattern is the question.

If product 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would break it into fragments with carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be on a carbonyl group, perhaps as an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons typically appear around 9-10 ppm, are singlets because they have no neighboring hydrogens. But if the aldehyde is part of a more complex structure, perhaps it's split into a multiplet.

Wait, but the question says to exclude exchange with deuterated solvent. So if there's a -OH group, it might exchange, but the aldehyde proton wouldn't. So the most deshielded H is probably the aldehyde proton.

In the NMR of product 3, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet. But the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, etc. So if the aldehyde's H is split by neighboring groups, perhaps it's coupled to two or more H's.

Wait, but aldehydes usually don't couple much because there's only one proton, and it's at the end. Unless it's in a conjugated system or near other H's. Wait, no, in ozonolysis, the aldehyde is formed at the end. So perhaps the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe product 3 has a structure where the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, if the ozonolysis breaks a symmetrical double bond into two aldehyde groups. But in that case, the H on the CH2 next to the aldehyde would be split by the
