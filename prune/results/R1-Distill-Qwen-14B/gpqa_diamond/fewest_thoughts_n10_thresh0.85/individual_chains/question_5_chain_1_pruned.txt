Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says the operator is P, and we're looking for the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, right, operators in quantum mechanics have eigenvalues and eigenvectors, just like in linear algebra. The eigenvector is a vector that only changes by a scalar factor when the operator is applied.

So, the components of the operator P are given: Px, Py, Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down what each component matrix is. 

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled similarly.

Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. That's the Pauli Z matrix scaled.

Wait, but when you have an operator in an arbitrary direction, say direction n, the operator isn't just P_z or P_x. Instead, it's a combination of all three components. The general form for the operator along a direction n is P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz.

But since n lies in the x-z plane, the y-component n_y is zero. So the operator P becomes P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Now, the direction vector n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps? Because in spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ would be measured from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Oh wait, wait. Wait, in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the x-axis? Or the z-axis? Hmm. Wait, maybe I should define it as θ being the angle from the z-axis. So for a vector in the x-z plane, the direction would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) but in our case, since it's in x-z, φ is zero or something. Wait no, wait, in x-z plane, φ is zero maybe? Because the standard spherical coordinates have φ as the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. So if n is in x-z, then φ is zero or π, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because for the x-z plane, we can represent the direction as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So P = sinθ * Px + cosθ * Pz.

Each of these is multiplied by ħ/2. So substituting the matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that:

The matrix inside is:
[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Because:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives [[cosθ,0], [0, -cosθ]]
Adding them together:
First element (1,1): cosθ + 0 = cosθ
(1,2): sinθ + 0 = sinθ
(2,1): sinθ +0 = sinθ
(2,2): 0 + (-cosθ) = -cosθ

So the matrix is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Multiply by (ħ/2), so P = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we have:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Substituting P:

(ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2) to simplify:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] |ψ> = |ψ>

So, this matrix equation is the same as (M - I) |ψ> = 0, where M is the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] and I is the identity matrix.

So, M - I is [[cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1]]

We can write the equation as:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Where a and b are the components of the eigenvector |ψ> = [a; b].

So, we have two equations:

1) (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

We can solve this system. Let me write them again:

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 --> (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b --> a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Let me simplify the denominator. cosθ -1 = - (1 - cosθ) = -2 sin²(θ/2). So denominator is -2 sin²(θ/2).

Wait, perhaps using some trigonometric identities would help.

Alternatively, let's look for non-trivial solutions. Since the matrix M - I is singular, the determinant must be zero. Compute determinant:

det(M - I) = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)^2.

Compute this:

= [ (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) ] - (sinθ)^2
= [ -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ + 1 ] - sin²θ
= [ -cos²θ + 1 ] - sin²θ
= (1 - cos²θ ) - sin²θ
But 1 - cos²θ is sin²θ, so:

= sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

So yes, determinant is zero, so it's consistent.

From equation 1: a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Let me compute the denominator: cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2)

So,

a = [ - sinθ ] / ( -2 sin²(θ/2) ) * b

= [ sinθ ] / (2 sin²(θ/2) ) * b

Hmm, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / (2 sin²(θ/2) ) * b

Simplify:

a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * b

= cot(θ/2) * b

So, a = cot(θ/2) b

So, the eigenvector components are a = cot(θ/2) b, and b = b.

Let me let b = sqrt(1/3) or something, but wait, we need to normalize the eigenvector.

Let me express the eigenvector as [a; b] = b [cot(θ/2); 1]

Wait, because a = cot(θ/2) b, so it's proportional to [cot(θ/2), 1]^T.

But we need to normalize this vector. The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should take a general approach. Let me set b = 1 for simplicity, then a = cot(θ/2). So the vector is [cot(θ/2), 1].

But then, the normalization factor would be 1/sqrt( |cot(θ/2)|^2 + 1 )

Compute that:

|cot(θ/2)|^2 +1 = (cos²(θ/2)/sin²(θ/2)) + 1 = [ cos² + sin² ] / sin² = 1 / sin²(θ/2 )

So normalization factor is sqrt( sin²(θ/2) ) = |sin(θ/2)|. Since θ is an angle, between 0 and π, so sin(θ/2) is positive. So normalization factor is sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(θ/2), 1 ] / sin(θ/2 )

Simplify cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), so:

[ (cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)) , 1 ] / sin(θ/2 ) = [ cos(θ/2) / sin²(θ/2), 1 / sin(θ/2) ]

Wait, wait, let me re-calculate:

Wait, if we have [ a, b ] with a = cot(θ/2) and b = 1, then the normalization factor is sqrt( a² + b² ) = sqrt( cot²(θ/2) + 1 ) = sqrt( csc²(θ/2) ) ) = 1/sin(θ/2).

So the normalized vector is [ a * sin(θ/2), b * sin(θ/2) ] = [ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2), 1 * sin(θ/2) ]

Simplify cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * sin(θ/2) ) = cos(θ/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that's interesting. So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). Now, considering that in quantum mechanics, states are defined up to a phase, the eigenvectors for spin-1/2 particles along any direction are often written in terms of these angles.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but option D is a combination with sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar and with theta/2.

Wait, but wait, in our calculation, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], but with what normalization? Because when you have a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates are typically written as (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) )^T. But in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane,
