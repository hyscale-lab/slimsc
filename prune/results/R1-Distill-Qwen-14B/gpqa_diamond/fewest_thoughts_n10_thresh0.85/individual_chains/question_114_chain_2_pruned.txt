Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is taking 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and treating it with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving A and B as different reagents. I need to find out which pair is correct.

Hmm, let me break it down. I remember that when ketones react with HCN or its salts, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, NaCN might be providing CN- ions. Oh right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, ketones can undergo addition reactions with cyanide.

So for the first reaction: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN and reagent A. I think that when ketones react with CN- under acidic conditions, it's the acid-catalyzed addition. So reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is sulfuric acid, H2SO4, but in terms of reagent, it's H3O+). That would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, and then CN- would attack.

Looking at the product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, the product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. So the reaction must be a cyanation followed by hydrolysis? Or maybe it's the addition of HCN followed by something else.

Wait, the product is a nitrile. So maybe it's a ketone plus NaCN in acidic conditions. Oh, wait, NaCN is a source of CN-. But when a ketone reacts with CN- under acidic conditions (like H2SO4 or H3O+), it forms a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol adjacent to a nitrile group. Wait, let me think: the cyanohydrin formation.

Cyanohydrin formation involves the addition of HCN (or CN-) to a ketone, with an acid catalyst. The product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. So yes, butan-2-one plus NaCN and acid (H3O+) would give that product. So in the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+.

Then for the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. This molecule has a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. The reaction is with H2O and reagent B. The product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I think there are a couple of methods. One is hydrolysis under strong acidic or basic conditions, but for n
