Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X, given certain parameters. I'm a bit rusty on some of this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem gives a Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, right, the interaction term involves the fermion field ψ_f and the boson X. So, the boson X is interacting with fermions. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, when considering decay products, the rest mass of X will dictate what particles it can decay into. Because, in particle physics, a particle can only decay into lighter particles. The sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

So, the possible decay channels will be into fermion-antifermion pairs, I think. Because the Lagrangian seems to have a Yukawa-like interaction, which usually couples a scalar (or boson) to fermions, allowing for processes like annihilation or decay into fermions.

Wait, the general rule is that a boson with mass M can decay into two particles of mass m each if 2m < M. So for each possible fermion, I'll check if twice their mass is less than 6 GeV.

But wait, do I need to consider the masses of the fermions? Let me think. The fermions in the Standard Model include quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) and leptons (electron, muon, tau).

So, the masses of these fermions are:

- Up quark: around 2 MeV (so 0.002 GeV)
- Down quark: about 4-5 MeV (0.004-0.005 GeV)
- Strange quark: ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark: way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon: ~0.105 GeV
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV

So, for each pair, I'll check if twice their mass is less than 6 GeV.

Let's list the possible fermion pairs:

1. b quark: Each b is ~4.5 GeV. So 2*4.5 =9 GeV, which is larger than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b bbar, because 9 >6. So option A is wrong because it includes b and anti-b.

Wait, but wait, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV, so for a fermion pair like b and bbar, each b is 4.5, so 4.5*2=9 GeV. But 9 is more than 6, so it's not allowed. Therefore, X cannot decay into b bbar.

So any option that includes b or bottom quarks is invalid. Looking at the options:

Option A: Includes b bbar. So A is not allowed.

Option B: Doesn't include b bbar. So possible.

Option C: Includes c cbar, etc., but does it have b? No, so C is possible.

Wait, what about the others.

Wait, option C's list includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar. Wait, no, X can't decay into t tbar because each t is 173 GeV, way above X's mass. So the option C includes t tbar, which is impossible. So C is wrong.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: b, s, u, d, tau, e. But b is impossible. So A is out.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Let's check each.

c quark: each is 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5=3 <6. So allowed.

s quark: each ~0.1 GeV. 0.2 <6. Allowed.

u: 0.002 GeV. 0.004 <6. Allowed.

d: 0.004 GeV. 0.008 <6. Allowed.

Tau: each ~1.777 GeV. 2*1.777≈3.554 <6. Allowed.

Muon: each ~0.105 GeV. 0.21 <6. Allowed.

Electron: negligible, so allowed.

So all the decay modes in option B are allowed. So option B is a candidate.

Wait, option D: same as B but includes tau and others. Wait, looking at D:

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. But again, b is too heavy. So D is incorrect.

So the allowed decay modes are all the fermions whose mass is less than 3 GeV each. Because 2m <6 GeV → m<3 GeV.

Wait, wait, no, because 2m <6 → m<3 GeV. So for each fermion, their mass must be less than 3 GeV.

So checking each option:

c quark: 1.5 GeV <3, allowed.

s quark: 0.1 GeV <3, allowed.

u, d: way below, allowed.

Tau: 1.777 GeV <3, allowed.

mu: 0.105 GeV, allowed.

e: allowed.

So what about the top quark? Not in any option except C, but top is way too heavy.

Wait, but in option C, it's including t tbar, which is impossible.

So the correct decay modes are all the fermions except those with m >=3 GeV. Because 2m >=6 GeV.

Wait, let me re-express: for a pair of fermions (like f and anti-f), the sum of their rest masses must be less than X's mass, 6 GeV.

Wait, no, more accurately, the invariant mass of the two-body decay must be the mass of X. Each fermion's rest mass must be less than X's mass. So for each particle, m_f < M_X/2.

Because M_X = 6 GeV. So M_X/2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with m_f < 3 GeV can be part of a decay.

So which fermions have m_f <3 GeV?

Let's list all the known fermions:

Leptons:

- e (electron): ~0.0005 GeV → allowed.

- mu: ~0.105 GeV → allowed.

- tau: ~1.777 GeV → allowed.

Quarks:

- up: ~0.002 GeV → allowed.

- down: ~0.003-0.005 GeV → allowed.

- strange: ~0.1 GeV → allowed.

- charm: ~1.5 GeV → allowed.

- bottom: ~4.5 GeV → not allowed (4.5 >3).

- top: 173 GeV → way above.

So, the allowed quarks are u, d, s, c, and their antiquarks. 

So the possible decay channels are into:

c cbar,

s sbar,

u ubar,

d dbar,

tau+ tau-,

mu+ mu-,

e+ e-.

Wait, but what about the option that includes all these except b and t?

Looking at the options:

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That's exactly the list I have. So option B is the correct one.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's correct. All these fermions have masses under 3 GeV, so 2m <6 GeV.

So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term provided suggests that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. A particle of mass \( M \) can decay into two particles of mass \( m \) each only if \( 2m < M \). Therefore, for \( X \), the condition is \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

The masses of the known fermions in the Standard Model are as follows:

- **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( \sim 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( \sim 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (excluded, as \( 4.5 > 3 \))
- **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (excluded, as \( 173 > 3 \))
- **Electron (\( e \))**: \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)

From this, the allowed fermion pairs are \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \) and \( e^+\,e^- \). These correspond to the decay modes listed in **Option B**. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is excluded because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, A is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \) and \( e^+\,e^- \), all of which satisfy \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is excluded because \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, C is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is excluded for the same reason as in A. Hence, D is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decay modes of \( X \).

Answer: B
