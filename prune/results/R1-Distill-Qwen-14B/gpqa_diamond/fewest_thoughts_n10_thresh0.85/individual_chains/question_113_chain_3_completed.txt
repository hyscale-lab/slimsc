Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.

The question says that the unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate O-H groups. Like, alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids? But wait, a very broad peak—could that be a strong O-H stretch. Also, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for a ketone or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with some substitution—like an aromatic ketone or something else. Wait, or maybe an amide? But I don't think there are any amide groups here since the options don't have N.

Then, the 1H NMR has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond, probably part of a ring or as a substituent.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I need to think about which fragments correspond to 45. Common fragments: maybe a CH2O group (like a formaldehyde loss?), but wait, 45 is more likely for something else. Let me think—what is 45? The molecular ion for CH3OCH3 (dimethyl ether) is 45, but that's not a common fragment. Oh wait, another possibility: the fragment could be from a ketone. Like, if the molecule breaks off a group that's a methyl ketone, then the loss of (CH3CO) is 43, but maybe not. Alternatively, 45 could be a CH2CH2O group? Or perhaps it's a CH2=CH-O- group? Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's the loss of a CH2O group. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of something else. Let me calculate: 45 is C2H5O (45 - 16 is 29, which is C2H5). Wait, that doesn't make sense because C2H5O would be a formula of maybe an ether or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2CH2O- group? Or perhaps it's a -COCH3 group? Wait, the molecular weight of CH3CO (which is 43, so 43 for CH3CO, but the peak is 45. Hmm, maybe it's (CH3)2O, which is 45 (15*3=45). Wait, (CH3)2O is 45? Let's calculate: (12*2) + (6*3) + 16 = 24 +18 +16=58. No, that's not right. Wait, 45 as m/z—could be a fragment like C3H7O? That would be (3*12) + (7*1) + 16 = 36 +7 +16=59. Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible molecular formulas given. The options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So each of these has different oxygen counts. Let's think about the IR data again. The broad peak at 3000 suggests an O-H group. So likely, the compound has either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group. The peaks at 1700 and 1650: if there's a carbonyl, then maybe it's an ester. Because an ester has a carbonyl (around 1700) and possibly an adjacent group that could absorb around 1650 if there's conjugation, like an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, such as in a ketone with an adjacent double bond.

Wait, but what about if it's a ketone and an alcohol? Then the IR would have the O-H (broad) and the ketone carbonyl at 1700. But where would the 1650 come into play? Maybe an aromatic ring with a ketone group. So perhaps it's something like acetophenone with an alcohol substituent? Or maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and an conjugated double bond, like in an aromatic ring.

The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond somewhere. So maybe it's an aromatic ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group and an O-H group. 

So let's think about the possible structures. If it's a di-substituted benzene ring, perhaps with an alcohol and a ketone or ester group. Wait, but how would that fit with the molecular formulas?

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen, (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one degree: either a ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So in that case, the structure has a double bond and perhaps a ring. Wait, but C6H12O2 has 6 carbons, which could be a benzene ring (which is three double bonds, but that's three degrees), but wait, benzene is 3 rings (each ring is one degree, each double bond is another). Let me calculate degrees of unsaturation more accurately.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since all options don't have X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So 1 degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so double bond. So a molecule with one double bond and maybe an oxygen-containing group.

But considering the IR has a broad O-H, perhaps an alcohol? So maybe something like cyclohexanol, but with a carbonyl. Hmm, but cyclohexanol would have an O-H, but a carbonyl would require another oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. For example, a cyclic ester would have an O in the ring and a ketone? Or maybe not, but if it's a lactone, it would have an ester group, which would show up as a carbonyl in IR. Also, a lactone would have a ring, which would account for a degree of unsaturation.

Wait, but the presence of a vinyl group (from the NMR) suggests an alkene. So the molecule probably has both a ring and a double bond, or perhaps two double bonds. Wait, but the DoU for option A is 1. So only one ring or double bond.

Wait, but the presence of a double bond (from vinyl H in NMR) implies that the molecule has at least one double bond. So DoU is 1, meaning either one ring and one double bond (but that would be two DoU), which is not possible. Wait, wait, no. Wait, each ring or double bond equals one DoU. So for one DoU, either one ring or one double bond. But the presence of vinyl H suggests at least one double bond. So the molecule must have a double bond, which would take up the DoU. But that's only one DoU. So perhaps it's a molecule with a double bond and no rings. For example, an ester with a double bond. Like an unsaturated ester.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with no double bonds. Hmm, but then why the vinyl H in NMR?

Wait, perhaps the compound has a conjugated system, like an ester with an adjacent double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted benzene ring with an ester group or something.

Wait, but let me think of the molecular formula. Option C is C6H10O2. DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond. But triple bonds are less common, so probably a ring and a double bond.

So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring (three DoU?), wait no: benzene has three double bonds and a ring, so four DoU, but the formula is only DoU 2. So perhaps a benzene ring is not the right structure here.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexene ring (which has one ring and one double bond, so DoU=2). So with O-containing groups.

Alternatively, for option C: C6H10O2. So maybe a structure like cyclohexene with two oxygen-containing groups, like an ester or a ketone and an alcohol.

Wait, but back to the IR data. The 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl. So maybe an ester or ketone. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation. Or, perhaps, an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would show a strong peak around 1680-1700, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the 1650 peak is a bit lower than the typical 1700 for a ketone. Maybe it's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, like an aromatic ketone. For example, acetophenone has a carbonyl around 1700 and the ring's C=C around 1680 or so. But the peaks here are 1700 and 1650. Maybe the 1650 is from another group. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an enone system.

So putting this together, the compound has an O-H (from the broad peak), a carbonyl (from 1700), another carbonyl or conjugated group (1650?), and a double bond (from vinyl H in NMR).

Wait, but the FTIR shows two strong peaks in the carbonyl region. Hmm, maybe it's a compound with two carbonyl groups. But the options don't have more than two oxygens except for options with O2. Let me check:

Looking at the options:

A: C6H12O2 → two oxygen atoms.

B: C6H10O → one oxygen.

C: C6H10O2 → two oxygens.

D: C6H12O → one oxygen.

So the IR shows two strong absorption peaks in the carbonyl region (1700 and 1650). Maybe it's an ester and another carbonyl group, but that would require three oxygens. Alternatively, two conjugated carbonyls, but that's stretching it. Alternatively, perhaps one carbonyl (like an ester at 1700) and another functional group, like an aromatic ring with C=C (which might absorb around 1650). Wait, but aromatic C=C stretches are usually around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So 1650 is a bit high for that. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an enone (a conjugated double bond next to a carbonyl), which would shift the carbonyl peak a bit lower than 1700. So maybe the 1700 is the carbonyl, and the 1650 is the conjugated double bond.

So the structure could be something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, methyl acrylate. But methyl acrylate has molecular formula C3H4O2. But our options are for C6, so perhaps it's a cyclic ester with an unsaturated chain.

Wait, another thought. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000. That's usually O-H from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is even broader and more around 2500-3300, but the peak here is at 3000, which is a bit lower. So maybe it's an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe a phenol, but phenols have broader O-H peaks, but I'm not sure.

So putting the O-H and the carbonyl together, perhaps the compound is an ester with an alcohol group. Wait, but that would require more oxygen. Wait, an ester is R-O-CO-R, so that's two oxygen atoms. So if the compound has an ester group and an alcohol (another O?), but that would be three oxygens, which only options with O2 can't have. Hmm, unless the ester is part of a cyclic structure, like a lactone, which is an ester but only uses two oxygens. But then where would the O-H come from? If it's a lactone, perhaps it's an intramolecular ester, and there's another hydroxyl group somewhere. But that would require three oxygens. Wait, the options for O2 include options A and C.

Alternatively, maybe the O-H is part of a ketone and an ester. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the structure has a hemiacetal or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has an ester group (O2) and an alcohol group. Wait, but that would require three oxygens. So that can't be. So maybe the O-H is part of another functional group.

Wait, perhaps it's a diol, but that would give a broad peak, but I don't see how that would explain the two carbonyl peaks.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 peak is not a carbonyl but an aromatic ring. Let's think: aromatic C=C would be around 1450-1600 cm^-1, and if it's para-substituted, perhaps the absorption is at higher wavenumbers. Wait, but 1650 is a bit high for simple aromatic rings. Maybe it's an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups, which can cause the absorption to shift to higher wavenumbers. For example, nitro groups or carbonyl groups attached to the ring.

Wait, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester. Like phenyl acetate. But phenyl acetate has a benzene ring, an ester group (COO), and an ethyl group. The ester carbonyl would be around 1700, and the benzene ring's C=C would be around 1600. But in the IR data, we have a peak at 1650. Maybe that's the ring with conjugation. Alternatively, if the ring has substituents that cause the C=C to absorb at a higher wavenumber.

Also, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are typically in a trans or cis arrangement, giving rise to a multiplet around 4-7 ppm. If the compound has a benzene ring, the ring protons would be around 7 ppm. But the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene, not necessarily benzene. So maybe the structure has an exocyclic double bond, like in an allyl group.

Wait, another thought: the mass spec has a peak at m/z=45. What does that correspond to? Let's think about possible fragments. 45 could be the loss of a CH2O group (formaldehyde is 30, so not that), or perhaps a CH3CO (43) plus something. Alternatively, maybe it's the loss of a COCH2 group (which would be 43 + 2?) Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, 45 could be the molecular ion of a fragment like (CH2)2O, which is ethylene oxide, but that's 44 (12*2 +16 + 2*1= 24+16+2=42? Wait, no. 12*2 is 24, 16 is O, 2 H is 2. So 24+16+2=42. So that's m/z=42. Not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, 45 could be CH3CH2O (45). Wait, that's 12*2 + 6 + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46. So no. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the loss of a methyl ester group. Like, losing (CH3O) which is 31 (12 + 16 + 3*1=31). No, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps it's the loss of a propionyl group (CH2CH2CO). Wait, that's 55 (3*12 + 3*1 +16= 36 +3 +16=55). Hmm, not 45.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is one of the options. Let's consider each and see which fits the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU = 1. So one double bond or ring. If it's a ring, like cyclohexane with some substituents, but if the NMR has vinyl H, it must have a double bond. So one double bond. So structure could be something like an ester with a double bond. For example, an allyl ester.

The IR would show O-H? Wait, the formula has two oxygens. So O2. So perhaps an ester and an alcohol? No, that would require three oxygens. So maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) with an O-H group. But wait, a lactone is an ester, which uses two O atoms. Then where does the O-H come from? It can't have another O. So maybe the O-H isn't part of the lactone. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol with an ester group, but that would require three O's. So perhaps the O-H isn't an alcohol but something else, like a carboxylic acid. But wait, the IR broad peak is at 3000. Carboxylic acids have very broad O-H stretches, often around 2500-3300, but the peak here is at 3000, which is a bit on the lower end, but possible. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid ester. But that would have two O's. Wait, the formula would have two O's: the ester group (O2). So a carboxylic acid ester would have the formula R-O-CO-R', which is O2. So that fits.

So for option A: C6H12O2. The structure could be an ester with a double bond. The ester would account for the carbonyl peak at 1700. The 1650 could be the conjugated double bond. The O-H could be from a carboxylic acid group, but wait, carboxylic acids have O-H, but then the formula would require another O. Oh wait, no. If it's an ester of a carboxylic acid, like RCOOR', then the two O's are already accounted for. So in that case, the O-H would come from where? Unless it's not a carboxylic acid but an alcohol. Wait, but in that case, the O's would be in the ester and the alcohol. Wait, but that would require three O's. So this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a phenol group. But then, the structure would have a benzene ring, which would account for more DoU. Hmm.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So two rings, one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds. The presence of vinyl H suggests at least one double bond. So perhaps a ring plus a double bond.

So the structure could be a cyclohexene ring with an ester group or a ketone. For example, if it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond elsewhere, but then where's the O-H? Alternatively, maybe the structure is a di-substituted benzene ring with an ester and a double bond. But benzene would require three DoU for the ring (each double bond is a DoU), but the formula only has DoU 2. So that's not possible.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about the molecular formulas and possible fragments. Let's consider each option's possible molecular weight.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72 +12 +32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72 +12 +16=100.

So the molecular ion would be one of those. The mass spec shows a fragment at 45. So which of these would lose a fragment of 45?

Maybe the molecule breaks off a group that has a mass of 45. Let's think:

If the molecular weight is 116 (option A), and a fragment is 45, then the remaining would be 71. Not sure if that makes sense.

Alternatively, 114 (option C) minus 45 is 69. Hmm.

Or perhaps the fragment is a common group. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O (which is 45: 12*2 +16 + 3*1*2=24+16+6=46. Wait, no. 12*2 is 24, 16 is O, 3*1 is 3 (two methyl groups would have 6 H, but the formula is (CH3)2O: 2*(12+3) +16= 30 +16=46. So that's 46. Not 45.

Wait, 45 could be the loss of a (CH2)2O group. Wait, (CH2)2O is 12*2 +16 + 2*1*2=24 +16 +4=44. No.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH2)3 group, which is 12*3 +2*3= 36 +6=42. Not 45.

Wait, what about a (CH3)CO group? That's 43. 12 + (12*2 +16 +3*1)= wait, no, (CH3)CO is 12 + (12*2 +16) + (3*1)= 12 + 32 +3=47. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, another approach: the fragment at m/z=45 could be a CH2CH2O group, but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group is 45? Let's see: 12*2 +16 + 2*1=24+16+2=42. No.

Alternatively, perhaps a CH2=CH-O- group. The molecular weight would be 12*3 +16 + (2*1 for the double bond)= 36 +16 +2=54. No, that's not 45.

Wait, another idea: the fragment could be an ethyl group with an oxygen. Wait, ethyl is 29, but maybe OCH2CH3 is 45? Let's calculate: 16 + (12*2 +6*1)=16 + 30=46. No, that's 46.

Wait, perhaps it's a (CH3OH) group. Methanol is 32. No, that's not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH3)COH group, which would be a 45 fragment. Let's calculate: 12*3 +16 + 1 + (H2O is 18, but here it's -COH, so 12+16 + 1 + 1 (O)? Wait, (CH3)COH has the formula C2H6O2. Wait, 2*12=24, 6*1=6, 2*16=32. 24+6+32=62. No, that's way too high.

I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe I should think about the possible structures again.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a fragment at m/z=45 could be indicative of the loss of a (CH2)3O group, but that's 44. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a (CH2)2OCH3 group. Wait, that's OCH2CH2CH3: 12*3 +16 +3*1=36 +16 +3=55. No.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere with this. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So maybe a cyclohexene ring (which has a double bond, so one DoU) and an ester group (which is another DoU? No, an ester is not a ring or double bond. Wait, no—DoU is calculated based on the formula, not the functional groups. So the ester group doesn't add a DoU. Wait, I think I was wrong about that. The ester group is O, but doesn't contribute to DoU since it's just a substituent. So in option C, two DoU comes from either a ring and a double bond or two double bonds.

So the structure could be something like a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted cyclohexene, with an ester group. So the IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1700, and the double bond (conjugated) may have a peak around 1650.

The O-H from the IR could be from an alcohol group, but the formula has two O's. So if it's an ester, that uses two O's. So where would the O-H come from? That's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a phenol group, but again, how does that fit with the molecular formula?

Wait, perhaps the O-H is part of a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a carboxylic acid. But wait, the formula has two O's. If it's a carboxylic acid, that uses two O's (COOH), so that would fit. But then where is the other carbonyl group in the IR? Because the IR shows two strong peaks in the carbonyl region.

Wait, unless it's a compound with both a carboxylic acid and an ester group. But that would require three O's, which isn't possible with options A or C, which have two O's.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to think about each option and see which fits all the data.

Option A: C6H12O2.

IR: Broad peak at 3000 (O-H, maybe an alcohol). Strong peaks at 1700 (ester carbonyl) and 1650 (maybe an adjacent double bond, as in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester). So the structure might be something like an allyl ester, which has a double bond next to the ester group.

The NMR shows vinyl H, so the double bond must be present.

Mass spec: fragment at 45. If the structure is an allyl ester, the possible fragments could be from the ester group breaking off. For example, the ester could cleave to give a methyl propenoate (CH2CHCOOCH3?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fragment could be from the ester's R-O- group breaking off. For instance, if the ester is R-O-CO-R', the R-O could fragment as a group. Let's see: for option A, molecular weight is 116. If a fragment of 45 is lost, the remaining would be 71. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Option C: C6H10O2.

IR: O-H (broad, 3000), carbonyl at 1700, another at 1650.

Structure: maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, a cyclopentene ring fused with an ester. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, a bicyclic structure? Or perhaps a benzene ring with substituents, but earlier I thought benzene requires more DoU than this.

Alternatively, maybe it's a structure with an ester and a conjugated double bond.

Wait, the NMR has vinyl H, so the structure must have a double bond. So the two carbonyls could be from an ester (1700) and perhaps a conjugated double bond (1650). But I thought conjugated double bonds don't absorb in the carbonyl region. Wait, no, the IR carbonyl region is 1300-1900. The 1650 could be the C=C in a conjugated system, like an enone.

So the structure could be something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would have the ester carbonyl at 1700 and the conjugated double bond at 1650. The O-H could be from an alcohol group. But then the formula would have three O's, which isn't the case. So maybe the O-H is from a phenol. But again, the formula has only two O's.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from a carbonyl group. No, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2 → Could be an ester with an alcohol substituent. But that would require three O's. Alternatively, it could be a cyclic ester (lactone) with an alcohol substituent. But again, O count is two, so maybe it's a lactone and an alcohol. No, that would require three O's.

Alternatively, the O-H could be from a hemiacetal, but I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2 → Could be a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent. The O-H is from an alcohol substituent, but again, that would require three O's. Hmm, not possible.

Wait, maybe the O-H is not from an alcohol but from a carboxylic acid. But then, the formula has two O's, which would mean the other O is in the ester. So the structure would be a carboxylic acid ester, like RCOOR', but that doesn't have an O-H. Unless it's a free acid, but that would require another O.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try another approach.

The FTIR has strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Two carbonyl groups? Or one carbonyl and another group.

Wait, another possibility: The peak at 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C. So the compound could be a substituted benzene with an ester group. For example, phenyl acetate would have a benzene ring, an ester group (two O's), and the aromatic C=C would be around 1600, but in the IR it's at 1650. Maybe due to substitution.

But the NMR has vinyl H, which suggests an alkene, not a benzene ring. So perhaps it's a vinyl ester. For example, something like methyl vinyl ester. But that would have a structure like CH2=CHCOOR, but I'm not sure about the formula.

Alternatively, the structure could have both a benzene ring and a vinyl group, but that would complicate the DoU.

Wait, another idea: the 1650 peak could be from a conjugated carbonyl, such as in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The 1700 would be the carbonyl, and the 1650 would be the conjugated double bond. So the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would have the formula CnH2n-2O2. Hmm, but the options vary.

If the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like CH2=CHCOOR, the formula would be C4H6O2. But our options have C6.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a six-carbon compound with an ester and a conjugated double bond. For example, something like CH2CH2CO-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the presence of a fragment at 45 in the mass spec. If the molecule is an ester with a vinyl group, maybe when it fragments, it loses a part of the molecule that's 45.

Let me think about the possible fragments for an ester. Esters often lose the R-O- group. For example, if the ester is RCOOR', the R' group might break off as a fragment. So for option C: C6H10O2. Suppose the structure is a six-carbon ester with a vinyl group. Let's say it's something like CH2=CHCOO(CH2)3CH3. But that would be more carbons than six.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is a cyclic ester, a lactone, which would have a ring structure. If it's a five-membered ring, like gamma-butyrolactone, but that's only four carbons. So a six-membered lactone would have a ring with an ester functional group. Then, the formula would fit option C. The FTIR would show the ester carbonyl at 1700, and the ring's C-O-C stretch around 1250-1050. The broad peak at 3000 would be from another group, but the formula has only two O's. So if it's a lactone, the O's are in the ester, so where is the O-H?

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the O-H is from a hydroxyl group attached to the ring. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester group and a hydroxyl group. But then that would require three O's, which isn't possible.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize the data:

- FTIR: Broad O-H (3000), ester/ketone at 1700, possibly conjugated at 1650.
- 1H NMR: Vinyl H → double bond present.
- Mass: fragment at 45 → need to find a fragment that is 45.

Now, looking for a fragment at 45. What's 45? Let's think of common groups:

- CH3COOH: 60 (since 45 is lower)
- CH3COO- would be 59 (45+14?), not sure.
- Maybe a (CH2)2O group: 12*2 +16 + 2= 24+16+2=42. Not 45.
- Alternatively, (CH3)2CHO: which is 58 (12*3 + 5*1 + 16). Not 45.

Wait, here's a thought: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O (45?), but earlier calculation said it's 46. Wait, (12*2)+(16)+(3*1)=24+16+3=43. So that's 43. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the loss of a CH2O group (formaldehyde). But that's 30. So 45 would be 45-30=15, which doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group. Wait, 12*2 +16 + 2= 24 +16 +2=42. Close but not 45.

Wait, another possibility: The fragment is a (CH2)3O group. 12*3 +16 +3=36+16+3=55. No.

Hmm. Maybe the fragment is a methyl group (15) and another group? No, not sure.

Alternatively, think about the molecular formula of each option and see if any can lose a 45 fragment.

Option A: C6H12O2 → molecular weight 116. 116-45=71. Is 71 a plausible fragment? Maybe. For example, the molecule could lose a group with 45, leaving 71. But I'm not sure what 71 would correspond to.

Option C: C6H10O2 → molecular weight 114. 114-45=69. 69 is the molecular weight of something like C4H9O. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment isn't a loss but a prominent peak. For example, in the case of an ester, the molecular ion might break into an acylium ion. For example, RCO+ would have a mass equal to the acyl group. If the acyl group is CH2CHCO (molecular weight 58), but that's not 45.

Wait, another approach: the most common fragments in mass spectrometry for esters are the loss of the R-O- group as an alkoxide. For example, in methyl acetate (CH3COOCH3), the most prominent fragment is the acylium ion (CH3CO+ at 60 m/z) and the methyl group (15). Wait, but that's for a small ester.

In our case, the fragment is at 45. So perhaps the acylium ion is 45, meaning the acyl group is 45. Let me check: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO (acetone is 58), wait no. Wait, 45 corresponds to C3H7O. Hmm, not matching any common groups.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be an ethylene oxide (but that's 44). Or but that's not a common fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an allyl group (CH2CHCH2+). That's 54. Hmm.

I'm not making progress on the mass spec part. Maybe I should look back at the IR and NMR.

The IR suggests an O-H (alcohol or phenol), and a carbonyl (ester or ketone). The NMR has vinyl protons, so a double bond. So the structure must have all of these.

Looking at the options, only options A and C have two oxygen atoms. Let's consider each:

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU =1. So a double bond or a ring.

If it's a double bond, then the structure has a double bond and an O-containing group. The O-H is present. So perhaps it's an allyl alcohol ester. Wait, no, because that would require more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. The O-H would come from where? Maybe a hydroxyl group but that would require another O, which isn't available.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So one ring and one double bond or two double bonds.

If it's a ring (like cyclohexene) and an ester group, then the O's are accounted for. The IR would have the ester carbonyl at 1700, and the conjugated double bond (if present) at 1650. The O-H could be from an alcohol substituent, but that would require another O. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the O-H is from a carbonyl group. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is part of a hemiacetal, but that requires a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a phenol group, but that would require a benzene ring, which would require more DoU.

Wait, maybe the structure is an ester with a diol substituent. But that would again require more O's.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about each option's structure.

Option A: C6H12O2. One double bond or ring.

If it's a ring, maybe a six-membered ring (benzene) but that requires three DoU. So that's not possible. So it must be a double bond. So the structure has a double bond, and the O's are in an ester or another group.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two DoU. So perhaps a cyclohexene ring (one DoU) and another double bond (like in an ester group, but that doesn't add a DoU). Or, a ring and an ester group.

Wait, the presence of an ester group doesn't add a DoU. So the two DoU must come from a ring and a double bond. So the structure could be a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent. The ester is O2, so the O-H must come from elsewhere.

But where? The formula has two O's, used in the ester. So the O-H must come from a neighboring group, but that's not possible with the given O's.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a methoxy group. No, that's not an O-H.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ester with an exocyclic double bond. For example, a structure like:

O
||
O-C-O
     \
      C=C

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like an allyl ester. For example, CH2=CHCH2COOR. The formula for that would be C5H8O2, but our option C is C6H10O2. So maybe it's a substituted allyl ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclopentene with an ester group. For example, cyclopentene with an ester substituent. Then, the DoU would be two (ring and double bond). But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should look for the most probable answer based on the data.

The IR has a broad O-H, so likely an alcohol or phenol. The presence of two carbonyls suggests an ester (since a ketone would have only one carbonyl). The NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond. The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

Looking at the options, the correct formula must have O-H, ester (two O's), a double bond, and the molecular formula that when fragmented could have a 45 peak.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU 1. Could be an ester with a double bond. The O-H would be from an alcohol, but that would require another O. So maybe not.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU 2. Could be a ring (cyclohexene) and an ester group. The O-H would be from an alcohol substituent, but again, O count is two. So maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else.

But without a clear conclusion, I'll make an educated guess. The presence of a broad O-H suggests an alcohol. The two carbonyls (if ester and another) would require more O's, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the two carbonyls are one ester and one conjugated double bond.

Wait, but that doesn't account for the IR peaks. The 1650 would be the conjugated double bond, not a carbonyl.

So, if the 1650 is a conjugated C=C, then the 1700 is the ester. Then the O-H is from an alcohol. So the structure would have an ester, a double bond conjugated to it, and an alcohol group.

But the formula must fit. Let's see:

If the structure is an allyl ester with an alcohol substituent, like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH2OH. The formula would be C8H12O3, which isn't any of the options. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an allyl alcohol ester. But again, the formula would have more O's.

Alternatively, the O-H is from a phenol group, but DoU wouldn't fit.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option A: C6H12O2. Because the IR shows an O-H (alcohol), an ester carbonyl, and the double bond (from vinyl H). The mass fragment could be from the ester group breaking off, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another thought: The mass spec fragment at 45 could be the loss of (CH3)2CO (acetone, 58?), no. Or perhaps the loss of a propyl group (45? 12*3 +1*6=42. No).

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion for option C is 114. If it loses a fragment of 45, the remaining would be 69. What's 69? It's the molecular weight of something like C4H9O, but I don't think that's a common fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a (CH2)2CO group. (12*3 +16 + 2*1)= 36+16+2=54. No.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the O-H and ester groups, the options are A and C. The presence of vinyl H suggests DoU is at least one. Option A has DoU 1 (a double bond), and the structure would have a double bond and an ester. The O-H would then be from an alcohol, but that would require another O. So perhaps option C is better because it has two DoU, allowing for a ring and a double bond, making more sense with the vinyl H and the two carbonyl peaks (assuming one is the ester and the other is from a conjugated system).

But I'm not certain. Given the IR peaks, I think the correct answer is option A: C6H12O2. Wait, no, because the O-H would require another O.

Wait, no, the O-H in option A would have to be part of the ester. No, that doesn't make sense. So I'm confused.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option A: C6H12O2. Because the DoU is one, which can account for a double bond, and the O's are two, fitting the ester and the O-H. But I'm not confident.


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. Here's the analysis:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**:
   - A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or phenol.
   - Strong absorption peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of carbonyl groups. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak likely corresponds to an ester or ketone, while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could be from a conjugated system, such as a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl (e.g., an α,β-unsaturated ester).

2. **1H NMR Data**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests the loss of a fragment with this mass. Common fragments with m/z = 45 include groups like CH3CO (43) or CH2CH2O (42), but the exact identity of the fragment is unclear.

4. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **A) C6H12O2**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. This could correspond to a single double bond or a ring. The structure could be an ester with a double bond, but the presence of an O-H group would require another oxygen, which is not available in this formula.
   - **B) C6H10O**: DoU = 2. This could correspond to a ring and a double bond or two double bonds. However, the presence of two carbonyl peaks in the IR and the need for an O-H group make this less likely.
   - **C) C6H10O2**: DoU = 2. This could correspond to a ring and a double bond. The structure could be a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond, but the presence of an O-H group would require another oxygen, which is not available in this formula.
   - **D) C6H12O**: DoU = 1. This could correspond to a single double bond or a ring. However, the presence of two carbonyl peaks in the IR and the need for an O-H group make this less likely.

### Conclusion:
The FTIR data strongly suggests the presence of an O-H group, a carbonyl group (likely an ester), and possibly a conjugated system. The 1H NMR data confirms the presence of a double bond. Among the options, **C6H10O2** (Option C) best fits the data, as it accounts for the two carbonyl peaks and the double bond, with the O-H group potentially arising from a phenol or alcohol substituent. However, the exact assignment of the fragment at m/z = 45 remains unclear.

Answer: C
