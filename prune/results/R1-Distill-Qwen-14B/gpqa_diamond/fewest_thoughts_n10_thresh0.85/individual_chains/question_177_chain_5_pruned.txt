Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radius and mass ratios are both 1.5 times. So Star_1 is bigger in both radius and mass. Then, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember something about blackbody radiation and the peak wavelength. Oh right, Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, they must be at the same temperature? Because λ_max * T = constant. So if λ_max is the same for both, T is the same. So their temperatures are equal.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is how fast the star is moving away or towards us. But when calculating luminosity, does that matter? I'm not sure. Well, luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, so maybe the radial velocity affects the observed brightness due to Doppler shift or something. Or perhaps it's a red herring and we don't need it. I'll have to think about that.

The question states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So I need to find the ratio L1/L2.

Luminosity of a star (assuming it's a blackbody) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since both stars have the same T (because their peak wavelengths are the same, implying same temperature), then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1=T2, that term is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, because R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. Squared is 2.25. So L1/L2 would be 2.25. So that's option A, which is 2.25.

But then there's the radial velocity part. I might have missed something. The radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s. How does that affect anything?

Wait, perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed wavelength, but since the peak wavelengths were determined through spectroscopy, maybe the measured λ is affected. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So regardless of their actual velocities, the measured λ_max is the same
