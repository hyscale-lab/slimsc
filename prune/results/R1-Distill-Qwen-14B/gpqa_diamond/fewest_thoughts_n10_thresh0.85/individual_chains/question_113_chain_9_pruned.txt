Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are all different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the given data.

First, let's go through each technique one by one and see what they tell us.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching. So that makes me think the compound might have an alcohol group or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H around 2500-3300, but sometimes it's very strong and broad. Alternatively, an alcohol would have a broad peak too. But then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is often a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a conjugated carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's an ester or a ketone along with something else.

Looking at the 1H NMR: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, right? So that suggests the compound has a double bond, probably an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring. But wait, vinyl could also be part of an ester group or something else. If it's an aromatic ring, like in a benzene, then the protons would be in a certain region. But if it's a simple double bond, maybe the vinyl protons would be around 4.5-6 ppm, but I'm not too sure.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. So what fragments have a mass of 45? Common fragments include the CH3CO+ ion (which is 43, wait, no, 43 is CH3CO? Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the molecular ion could break into smaller ions. 45 could be something like (CH3)2CO+ (if that's the case, but molecular weight of (CH3)2CO is 74, so fragment of 45 would be a part of it. Or maybe something like C3H7O+? Let's see: C=12, H=1, O=16. 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16. 36+7+16=59. No, that's 59. Maybe another approach. Maybe it's a ketone or ester group. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight for (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. No, wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which is 58 g/mol. Wait, 45 is lower. Hmm. Maybe it's CH2O (formaldehyde is 30), but 45. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH2=CH-O- or something else. Alternatively, could be a CH2CH2O group? Wait, I'm not getting it. Maybe the fragment is a ketene or something else. Alternatively, think about the possible options and see which would give a fragment of 45.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. So the possible formula is something like an ester or a diol, but with two oxygen atoms. For an ester, the formula would be R-O-CO-R'. The molecular weight would be (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) = 72 +12 +32= 116. So the molecular ion would be around 116. But the fragment is 45.

Option B: C6H10O. Formula is C6H10O. Degree of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N, it's (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2= 2. So two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc. Could be something like cyclohexene with an alcohol group.

Option C: C6H10O2. Formula is C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation: (12+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Maybe an ester (which has a carbonyl and an ether linkage), or a cyclic ester, or maybe a ketone and an alcohol, but probably more likely an ester.

Option D: C6H12O. Formula is C6H12O. Degree of unsaturation: (12+2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, could be a ring or a double bond. Maybe cyclohexanol or something similar.

Now, the FTIR peaks: the broad peak at 3000 suggests O-H. Then peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl group or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, could this be an ester? Because esters have a carbonyl around 1740-1700, but sometimes lower if conjugated. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, but then why another peak at 1650? Maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a benzene ring with substituents. Wait, but without the aromatic C-H stretches, maybe it's not benzene.

Wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. Those are typically in the 4.5-6 ppm range if they're adjacent to an electronegative atom, or maybe lower if they're in a different environment. So maybe the compound has a double bond, not an aromatic ring.

Putting it together: the presence of O-H (broad peak), a carbonyl (1700), another peak at 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe a conjugated system. So perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups, but that's a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe one carbonyl and an aromatic ring with C=C, which would have absorption around 1650.

Wait, another possibility: the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone which is next to a double bond, leading to a lower wavenumber for the carbonyl. So perhaps it's an ester, which would have two oxygen atoms. So looking at the options, options A and C have two oxygen atoms.

Looking at the mass spectrum fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is 12*3 +1*1 +16*1 =36+1+16=53? Wait, no, wait 45. Oh, 45 can be C3H7O+? Let me calculate: C3 is 36, H7 is 7, O is 16. 36+7=43 +16=59. Hmm, no. Maybe another approach. Maybe the fragment is a CH2CH2O group? Or perhaps the molecular ion breaks into smaller parts.

Alternatively, the fragment m/z 45 could be a ketene ion (like (CH3)2CO+ would have a molecular weight of 58; the ketene would be 45? Wait, ketene is O=C=O, which is 44. Hmm, no. Or maybe a different fragment. Wait, maybe the fragment is CH3CO-O-R breaking into CH3CO-O- plus something else. Wait, CH3CO-O- would have a molecular weight of 60 (CH3CO is 58, O is 16, but that's 74. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's an acetyl group. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO+? Let me compute. (CH3)2CHO is (2*12 + 6) + 12 (from CHO) ? Wait, no, let me count the atoms. (CH3)2CH-O would be (3 carbons in the CH3 groups, one C in the CH, one O). So 4 carbons, 9 H, and one O. So molecular weight is (4*12) + 9 +16=48+9+16=73. No, that's too high.

Wait, maybe it's the fragment from an ester. Let's say the ester is R-O-CO-R'. When the ester breaks, perhaps it cleaves into an acylium ion, like CO-O-R. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it breaks into a smaller piece. Another thought: the most common fragment at 45 I've heard of is the CH2=CH-O+ group (molecular weight 45? Let's see: C2H4O. 2*12=24, 4*1=4, 16=16. 24+4+16=44. No, that's 44. Close, but not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a methyl ester. Wait, methyl acetate is CH3COOCH3, which has a molecular weight of 88. If it breaks into something else, perhaps the acetyl group (CH3COO-) would be 60, but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe a smaller fragment.

Wait, what about the acetate group losing a methyl? So, if the ester is R-O-CO-OCH3, but that's not likely. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about the molecular formula options. Let's look at each option's possible structure.

Option A: C6H12O2. Could this be an ester, like methyl cyclopentanoate or something? Or perhaps a diol with a ketone. But the IR has a broad peak, which would suggest either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But with two O's, maybe an ester and an alcohol. Or perhaps a cyclic ester (lactone). If it's a cyclic ester, maybe the IR would show a carbonyl around 1700. But the IR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation is 2. So maybe an ester (which has one double bond in the carbonyl) and another double bond elsewhere, like an alkene, or a ring. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester (which is a lactone) would have a ring and a carbonyl. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond, not necessarily an aromatic ring. So perhaps the structure has an ester group and a double bond.

So putting it all together: the IR has a broad O-H (maybe an alcohol) and two carbonyls, but wait, no, the two peaks could be one carbonyl and another. Wait, 1700 is a strong peak (probably a carbonyl), 1650 could be conjugated to something else, like an alkene. So maybe the compound has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester) and a conjugated double bond.

The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond, so maybe a conjugated system. Think of something like an enol ester, or perhaps a dienone, but that's getting complicated.

The mass spec fragment at 45: I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps it's the acetyl group. Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options. Let's calculate their possible molecular weights.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight = (6*12) +12 + (2*16)=72 +12 +32=116.

Option B: C6
