Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane, with an eigenvalue of +ħ/2. 

Wait, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices are used, right? So the operator P must be a spin operator. The components Px, Py, Pz are given, each as ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. 

Let me write down what each component looks like. 

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2)*[[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. Pz is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix. 

The operator P here is the vector operator, so it's given by P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. The direction n is in the x-z plane, so n has components (nx, 0, nz). Since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1. But we don't know the exact direction, so perhaps the eigenvector will depend on the angles involved. 

Wait, the problem says it's along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So the direction vector can be parametrized using polar coordinates, maybe with an angle θ in the x-z plane. So, n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Or maybe it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ). Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Well, but since it's arbitrary, perhaps the eigenvector will be expressed in terms of θ and another angle φ, but since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ would be zero? Or maybe not. Oh wait, no, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle with respect to the z-axis is θ, and the azimuthal angle φ would be 0. So maybe the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle.

So the operator P along n is P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So P = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Because the y-component is zero.

Wait
