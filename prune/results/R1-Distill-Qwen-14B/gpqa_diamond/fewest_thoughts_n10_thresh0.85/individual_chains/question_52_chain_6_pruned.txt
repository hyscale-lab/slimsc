Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Alright, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how that affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right, I remember that the ratio of atoms in different energy levels depends on the temperature. Oh wait, that's the Boltzmann equation, right?

So the star has two scenarios: one where 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, and another where it's not. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. With spots covering 40% of the surface, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but why does the overall temperature decrease when spots are present? Oh right, because dark spots are cooler and emit less light, so the average temperature of the star as seen from afar goes down. 

But the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star is spotted, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when it's not. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So factor = (N1/N2)_unspotted / (N1/N2)_spotted.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. But wait, the wavelength is probably given because it's used to calculate the energy difference between the two levels. Oh right, because energy is related to wavelength via E = hc/λ.

So first, let's think about the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since we're dealing with neutral Ti, I suppose that the ionization isn't a factor here, so we can ignore that part. 

Wait, the problem says it's the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two levels. So we're just considering the same element in different states, not ionization. So the Boltzmann factor applies here.

So, let's denote the energy levels as E1 and E2, with E2 > E1 (since level 2 is higher). Then the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Wait, no, I think the formula is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ) ), so if E_i > E_j, then this ratio is less than 1. 

But in the problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the spots are present, Teff is lower, so the ratio is lower. So when Teff is lower, the exponent becomes more negative, making the exponential term smaller, so the ratio goes down. So the ratio without spots is higher than with.

We can model this using the ratio (n1/n2) as proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because if E2 is higher than E1, then E2-E1 is positive. So when T is lower, the exponential term is smaller. So when the star has spots (lower T), n1/n2 is smaller, which is what the problem states.

Our goal is to compute the factor by which the ratio changes. So, factor = (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted. 

Let me denote the two scenarios as T1 = 6000 K (unspotted) and T2 = 5500 K (spotted). The ratio is (n1/n2) = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) * (g1/g2). But since the problem doesn't give any info about the statistical weights (g1 and g2), perhaps they are the same, or the question is assuming that the ratio (g1/g2) is constant or cancels out because it's the same element. Alternatively, maybe the question only concerns the exponential part and
