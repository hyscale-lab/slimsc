Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift tells us about the planet's presence.

The question says we have two stars with the same mass, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, same host star masses, same planet masses. But the spectral line shifts are different: 5 milliangstrom for planet 1 and 7 for planet 2. The question is how much longer the orbital period of planet 2 is compared to planet 1.

Wait, I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) relates to the Doppler shift. K is the maximum velocity of the star in the direction of the observer. So the shift in wavelength (like 5 or 7 milliangstroms) must be related to K.

I remember that the Doppler shift formula is something like delta lambda over lambda equals K over c, where c is the speed of light. So delta_lambda = (K / c) * lambda. But wait, sometimes the formula is written as the velocity semi-amplitude K. So maybe I can relate the shifts to K.

But then, the period of the planet's orbit is related to the star's velocity through the radial velocity method. I think the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (something else?) Wait, maybe I should refer to the formula correctly. Alternatively, I think the formula is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (8 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, that might be getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a simplified version because M_p is much less than M_star. So M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Thus, K can be approximated as proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )).

Wait, let me think. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) * (1 / (2 pi c )) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of K as:

K = ( ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (2 pi)) ) * (1 / (c * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps I should find a way to relate K and the period P.

Alternatively, I remember that when the mass of the planet is much smaller than the star's mass, the formula simplifies to K ≈ ( ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(
