Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about how the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when a star has spots. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations in different energy levels depends on temperature. 

The star is a main-sequence star with certain parameters. When it has 40% of its surface covered by spots, the effective temperature decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K. Wait, but effective temperature is an average measure, right? The presence of spots (which are cooler) lowers the overall Teff. 

But how does this affect the ionization and excitation states of atoms in the photosphere? Oh wait, the photosphere is the outer layer we see, so when the star has spots, the overall temperature of the photosphere is lower. So the photospheric temperature is now 5500 K instead of 6000 K. 

The ratio in question is the number of atoms in level 1 over level 2 (n1/n2). I think the formula for this ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), right? So n1/n2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), but wait, wait. Let me get the formula right. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Oh wait, no, actually, it's (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then n1/n2 would be exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) times (g1/g2). 

Wait, but in this question, the ratio observed decreases when the star has spots. So when the temperature decreases, the ratio (n1/n2) goes down. That suggests that the ratio is higher at higher temperatures. 

Let me think: when T increases, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases because T is in the denominator. Since E2 - E1 is positive (assuming E2 is higher), the exponent becomes larger, so the exponential term becomes larger. So n1/n2 would be larger when T is higher. So when the star has spots (T is lower), n1/n2 is lower, which matches the observation. 

So the ratio is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots. Because when the spots are present, the ratio is lower, so the factor would be greater than 1. 

So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots. Let's compute that. 

The ratio is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), assuming g1 and g2 are same or the problem doesn't give data about them. Wait, the problem doesn't mention the statistical weights, so perhaps we can assume they are the same, so the ratio is solely determined by the exponential. 

Alternatively, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the near UV, I think. Since the energy difference is related to the wavelength: E = hc/λ. 

So let's compute ΔE = hc/λ. h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. Let me note the values: h ≈ 6.626e-34 J·s, c ≈ 3e8 m/s, λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m. 

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Let me calculate that: 

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m 

Divide by 1448e-10 m: (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon. 

But since we're dealing with energy differences per particle, that's ΔE. 

We can compute (ΔE)/(k T) for both temperatures. 

k is Boltzmann constant, 1.38e-23 J/K. 

So let's compute for T1=6000 K and T2=5500 K. 

Compute x1 = ΔE / (k T1) and x2 = ΔE / (k T2). 

x1 = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23 * 6000) 

1.38e-23 * 6e3 = 8.28e-20 

x1 = 1.373e-18 / 8.28e-20 ≈ 16.56 

x2 = 1.373e-18 / (1.38e-23 * 5500) 

1.38e-23 *5500 = 7.59e-20 

x2 = 1.373e-18 /7.59e-20 ≈ 18.05 

Wait, wait, but wait, wait. Because when T increases, x = ΔE/(k T) decreases. Because T is in the denominator. So higher T → lower x. So in x1 (6000 K) is smaller than x2 (5500 K)? Wait, no, wait, wait, let me compute again. 

Wait, 5500 K is lower than 6000 K. So when T is lower, x = ΔE/(k T) is higher. 

So x1 is for T=6000 K: 

6000 K: ΔE/(k T) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23 * 6e3)
= 1.373e-18 / (8.28e-20)
= approx 16.56 

For T=5500 K: 

5500 K: (1.373e-18)/(1.38e-23 *5.5e3) 

1.38e-23 *5.5e3 = 7.59e-20 

1.373e-18 /7.59e-20 ≈ 18.05 

So x2 is larger than x1 because T is lower. 

So the exponents are (E2 - E1)/(k T) = x, which is larger for lower T. 

So the ratio without spots is exp( x1 ), and with spots is exp(x2). 

Wait, no, wait. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), assuming g1/g2 =1. So without spots, T is higher, n1/n2 is exp(16.56), and when T is lower, n1/n2 is exp(18.05). Wait, but that can't be right because exp(18) is much larger than exp(16). But earlier we thought that when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. 

Wait, wait, maybe I mixed up the levels. Let me think again. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), because the higher level (E2) has lower population than E1 if E2 > E1. So when E2 > E1, (E2 - E1) is positive, so the exponent is positive. 

But wait, when E2 is higher, the population is lower. So n2 = n1 * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So n1/n2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), which would be a number greater than 1 if E2 > E1. 

So if the temperature decreases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent is larger, making the ratio n1/n2 larger. But the question says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Wait, that's a contradiction. Hmm, so maybe I have the ratio inverted. 

Wait, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1? Let me re-express the Boltzmann equation correctly. The Boltzmann factor is for the higher energy level being less populated. So n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then (E_i - E_j) is E2 - E1. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -x ), where x is positive. So n2/n1 is inversely proportional to exp(x). 

Wait, but the question says that the ratio of n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. 

If the ratio is n1/n2, and it decreases when T decreases, then perhaps n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Because E2 > E1, so E1 - E2 is negative. So -(E1 - E2) is positive. So the exponent is positive, and as T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, making the exp term larger. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). 

But wait, if n1 is lower energy than n2, then n1 is more populated than n2. So n1/n2 would be bigger when T is higher? Hmm, but according to the problem, when T decreases (due to spots), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that would imply that as T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. 

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again. Let's assume E2 > E1. So
