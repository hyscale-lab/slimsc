Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct reagents for two reactions. Let's take this step by step. 

The first reaction is between butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) and NaCN with a reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably some kind of nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, but wait, I think that the addition of a nitrile group to a ketone would typically be via a specific mechanism. Oh right, the formation of a cyanohydrin. 

So, the cyanohydrin formation. I recall that ketones can react with cyanide ions (CN-) in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid helps to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile. So the reaction is: ketone + NaCN (which provides CN-) with an acid (like H3O+) as catalyst. That should form the cyanohydrin. 

Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, the structure would have a CN group attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. That makes sense because in the cyanohydrin formation, the CN- adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the OH comes from the protonation and attack on the carbonyl oxygen. So in this case, the carbonyl is in the center of butan-2-one, so both substituents (the two methyl groups) would be on the same carbon. So the product adds a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on that same carbon. 

So for reagent A, the acid must be H3O+ because that's the typical catalyst for such reactions. So in the options, any where A is H3O+ would be a possible choice. 

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is treated with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait a minute, so the nitrile group is converting into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. The typical reactions are either hydrolysis with strong acid and heat or with a strong base. Let me think. Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic conditions, like HCl or H2SO4, and often heat. Alternatively, under basic conditions, it might form a sodium salt which is then acidified. 

So in this reaction, reagent B is given as H2O. Wait, but for nitrile hydrolysis, you need more than just water. It usually needs an acid catalyst. So, maybe the reagent B is HCl. Because, when you have a nitrile, adding HCl (like HCl gas) as a catalyst in aqueous conditions would help in the hydrolysis. So the nitrile group (CN) would become COOH after hydrolysis.

Wait, but looking at the reaction: the product is a hydroxybutanoic acid. The starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So, the nitrile is at the end, and after hydrolysis, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So, the reagent B is probably an acid, such as HCl or another strong acid. 

Looking at the options for reagent B: options A and B have B as HCl and CH3COOH, respectively. Let's think about the conditions. Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically uses a strong acid like HCl with heat. Does H2O alone suffice? I don't think so. So the reagent B must be an acid. 

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is either HCl or another strong acid. So looking at the options:

Option A: B is HCl. So that's possible.
Option B: B is CH3COOH. Hmm, acetic acid is a mild acid. Maybe it can work, but usually, for nitrile hydrolysis, a strong acid is needed. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction?

Wait, another thought: the first step formed a cyanohydrin (OH and CN on same carbon). The second step is converting that nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile is at the end of a chain. 

Wait, the starting material for the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is a four-carbon chain, with a benzyl group attached at the second carbon, which also has a hydroxyl and a nitrile group. So the nitrile is at the end, so when it hydrolyzes, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

So the reaction is: R-CN + H2O (with some catalyst) → R-COOH.

So the catalyst for this should be an acid, like HCl. So reagent B is HCl.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl. That fits both reactions.

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B= HCl. Hmm, what's NaHSO3 used for? I'm not sure. Maybe in some other reactions, like maybe hydrolysis under milder conditions?

Wait, but the first reaction requires an acid catalyst. So if reagent A is NaHSO3, which is a strong acid (since HSO3^- is a weak base, but in solution as an acid), but I'm not sure. Wait, wait. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Hmm, I'm trying to think if that's used for something else. Oh, maybe for sulfonation or for some kind of addition reactions, but I don't recall it being used as a catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.

So the first step's reagent A should be H3O+ to protonate the ketone. So that means options A and B are possible for the first part.

So in the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

Looking at the second reaction, if B is HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B).

Wait, but what's the condition for the second reaction? The second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The typical conditions are HCl (concentrated), with heat. So if reagent B is HCl, then option A would be correct for B.

So combining the two: first reaction A is H3O+, second reaction B is HCl. So looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that would fit.

Wait, but wait another point. The second reaction may require more than just HCl. Or perhaps in the presence of water, maybe something else is needed. Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via a two-step process: nitrile to amide, then to acid, but that's under basic conditions, perhaps.

Alternatively, another way nitriles can be hydrolyzed is under acidic conditions with a protic acid. So for the second reaction, the reagent is HCl, so B is HCl. Therefore, the correct option is A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is A=NaHSO3, B=HCl. Hmm, but I thought reagent A is H3O+ for the first reaction. So option A would be the correct choice, I think.

So the answer would be option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. The product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, confirms that the reaction proceeds via cyanohydrin formation. Therefore, the reagent A must be an acid, specifically H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a nitrile-to-carboxylic-acid transformation, which typically requires a strong acid catalyst, such as HCl, to facilitate the hydrolysis. Reagent B must therefore be HCl.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, CH₃COOH is a mild acid and not suitable for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for cyanohydrin formation, as it is not typically used as an acid catalyst in such reactions.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct choice is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
