Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that the question gives me some info about the magnitude limits for each spectrograph. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning V < 17. HIRES can go down to V < 16. So any star that's brighter than 16 in V magnitude can be seen by both? Or wait, no: if a star's apparent magnitude is less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO, but for HIRES, it's less than 16. Wait, no, the question says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO, which probably means V ≤17 can be observed. Similarly, "brighter than 16" for HIRES, so V ≤16. So a star must have apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be seen by both, because HIRES can't see beyond 16, while ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So for a star to be detected by both, it must be apparent V ≤16.

Wait, no: actually, the question says with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So that's V <17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 in V, meaning its V magnitude is less than 17, it can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16.

Wait, that's a key point. So the apparent magnitude needs to be below each instrument's limit for them to be detectable.

So, for each star, I need to compute their apparent V magnitude and see which ones are ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. The stars that meet both would be detectable by both instruments.

Wait, but wait. Some stars have absolute magnitudes, so I need to compute their apparent magnitudes based on their distance. Oh, because absolute
