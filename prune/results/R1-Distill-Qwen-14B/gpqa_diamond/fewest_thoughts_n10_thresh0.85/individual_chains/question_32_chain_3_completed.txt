Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. Li-6 is commonly used in some reactions, I think.

So, the problem is about relativistic energy. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Right, because when v is a significant fraction of c, gamma becomes important.

The speed is given as 0.96c. Let me compute gamma first. Let me plug in v = 0.96c into the gamma formula.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²). Let me calculate 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96. Let's see, 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then the square root of 0.0784 is... wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Hmm, wait, is that right? Let me double-check the square. 0.28 * 0.28: 0.08 * 0.08 is 0.0064, but wait 28 * 28 is 784, so 0.28^2 is 0.0784. Yes, that's correct. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 0.96^2 again. 96 * 96 = 9216, so 0.96^2 is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 10/2.8? Wait, 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/0.28 is 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.5714286.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need to find the energy E. The formula is E = gamma * m * c squared. But wait, what's the mass m here? It's the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. So I need the mass of Li-6 in appropriate units.

Wait, in particle physics, the energy is usually given in GeV, and masses are often in MeV/c². So I need to find the rest mass of Li-6 in MeV/c², then convert that to GeV when calculating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the atomic mass of Li-6. The atomic mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of protons and neutrons, each approximately 1 u (unified atomic mass unit). But wait, protons and neutrons have slightly different masses, but in general, the mass of a nucleus is roughly A * u, where A is the mass number. The exact mass can be found using the periodic table or from standard data.

Wait, I think the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 6.017569 u. Let me see, I recall that the mass of a Li-6 atom is approximately 6.017569 u. But wait, wait, wait—does that include electrons? Because if the nucleus is just the protons and neutrons, then the atomic mass is the mass of the nucleus plus the electrons. Oh, but wait, the nucleus in a collider is considered as the bare nucleus, so perhaps the mass we need is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. Wait, no—if the nucleus is a bare nucleus, meaning it has no electrons, then the mass would be the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, wait, another approach. The mass of a single Li-6 atom is 6.017569 u. Each Li atom has 3 electrons. The mass of each electron is about 0.00054858 u. So for 3 electrons, that's 3 * 0.00054858 ≈ 0.00164574 u. So the mass of the nucleus is 6.017569 u - 0.00164574 u ≈ 6.015923 u. But wait, that's the mass of the nucleus as a bare nucleus. So that's the m in E = gamma * m c².

Alternatively, perhaps in the context of this problem, they're treating the nucleus as a single particle with charge and mass, so the mass in question is the mass of the nucleus. So I'll take m = 6.015923 u.

Wait, but another thought—if the nucleus is moving, its rest mass is that of the nucleus, but in the formula E = gamma m c², m is the rest mass. So yes, I should use the bare nucleus mass.

Alternatively, perhaps in particle physics, the mass is given in terms of MeV/c². So I can convert the atomic mass from u to MeV/c². Since 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c². So for 6.015923 u, that's 6.015923 * 931.5 MeV/c².

Let me compute that:

6.015923 * 931.5 ≈ ?

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.015923 * 931.5 ≈ approximately 14.8 (since 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.005923 *931.5≈5.51, so total about 14.825).

So total is approximately 5589 + 14.825 = 5603.825 MeV.

Wait, but wait, 6.015923 * 931.5 = Let me compute it more accurately.

6.015923 * 931.5

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.015923 * 931.5 = Let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315; 0.005*931.5=4.6575; 0.000923 *931.5 ≈ 0.859.

So 9.315 +4.6575 =13.9725 +0.859=14.8315.

So total is 5589 + 14.8315 = 5603.8315 MeV.

So m ≈ 5603.8315 MeV/c² = 5.6038315 GeV/c².

Wait, because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 5603.8315 MeV is 5.6038315 GeV.

So m = approx 5.6038 GeV/c².

Now, gamma is approx 3.5714, as computed before.

So E = gamma * m c².

But wait, since m is in GeV/c², and c² is (c in m/s, but units-wise, since we're using GeV, the c² is accounted for in the mass unit. So E would be in GeV.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.6038 GeV.

Compute that: 3.5714 *5.6038.

Let me compute 3.5 *5.6 = 19.6.

But more accurately:

3.5714 *5.6038.

Let me break it down:

3 *5.6038 =16.8114

0.5714 *5.6038.

Compute 0.5 *5.6038=2.8019

0.0714 *5.6038≈0.402.

So 2.8019 +0.402 ≈3.2039.

So total E = 16.8114 +3.2039≈20.0153 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 3.5714 *5.6038.

Let me do it step by step.

3.5714 *5.6038 = ?

Compute 3 * 5.6038 = 16.8114.

0.5 *5.6038 =2.8019.

0.07 *5.6038=0.392266.

0.0014 *5.6038≈0.007845.

Adding these up:

16.8114 +2.8019 =19.6133.

19.6133 +0.392266 =20.005566.

20.005566 +0.007845≈20.013411 GeV.

So approximately 20.0134 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Option D is 21.419, which is much higher. Option B is 23.069, which is even higher. Option A is 18.475.

Wait, but wait—did I make a mistake in the mass calculation?

Because I assumed that the mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015923 u, but maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017569 u. But that's the mass of the atom, which includes the electrons. So for the nucleus, we subtract the mass of the electrons. Each Li atom has 3 electrons. So 3 * (mass of electron) = 3 * 0.0005485799 u = approximately 0.0016457397 u.

So atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.017569 u. Subtract 0.0016457397 u, which gives 6.01592326 u for the nucleus.

So that's correct.

So m =6.01592326 u =6.01592326 *931.5 MeV/c².

Wait, 931.5 MeV/u is a commonly used conversion factor. So 6.01592326 *931.5 MeV/c² = ?

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.01592326 *931.5 = Let me compute that.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.00092326 *931.5 ≈ 0.00092326 *900=0.830934, and 0.00092326 *31.5=0.029068. So total approx 0.830934 +0.029068=0.860002.

So 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725; plus 0.860002=14.832502.

So total 5589 +14.832502=5603.832502 MeV =5.603832502 GeV.

So m ≈5.6038325 GeV/c².

Now, gamma is 3.5714286.

So E=gamma*m=3.5714286 *5.6038325 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714286 *5.6038325.

Hmm.

3 *5.6038325=16.8114975.

0.5714286 *5.6038325.

Break that down:

0.5 *5.6038325=2.80191625.

0.0714286 *5.6038325.

0.07 *5.6038325=0.392268275.

0.0014286 *5.6038325≈0.007986.

So 0.392268275 +0.007986≈0.400254.

So 2.80191625 +0.400254≈3.202170.

Adding to the 16.8114975: 16.8114975 +3.202170 ≈20.0136675 GeV.

So approximately 20.0137 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma. Because 0.96c is a high speed, so gamma is 3.5714, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571.

Wait, that's correct. So gamma is exactly 25/7, which is approximately 3.571428571.

So E = (25/7) * m.

Wait, m is 5.6038325 GeV.

So 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.6038325.

Let me do it more precisely.

5.6038325 * 3.57142857.

Hmm.

I can compute this as (5 + 0.6038325) * (3 + 0.57142857).

But perhaps a better way is to compute it as 5.6038325 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.6038325 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0038325 *3.57142857≈0.01368.

So 2.142857142 +0.01368≈2.156537.

So total E ≈17.85714285 +2.156537 ≈20.013679 GeV.

So around 20.0137 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C (20.132) and option D (21.419). But my calculation is about 20.01 GeV, which isn't an option. Wait, the options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, my answer is about 20.01, but option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of m. Let me double-check that.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.017569 u. Subtracting the electrons' mass: 3 * 0.0005485799 u =0.0016457397 u. So 6.017569 -0.0016457397 =6.01592326 u.

Now, 6.01592326 u *931.5 MeV/u = ? Let me compute 6.01592326 *931.5.

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.01592326 *931.5.

Compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.00092326 *931.5≈0.86 (as before).

So 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.86=14.8325.

So 5589 +14.8325=5603.8325 MeV=5.6038325 GeV.

So that's correct.

Hmm, then gamma is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)

(0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6038325 GeV.

Wait, let me compute 5.6038325 *3.57142857 with more precise steps.

3.57142857 is approximately 25/7, which is exactly 3.571428571428571....

So 5.6038325 * (25/7) = (5.6038325 *25)/7.

Compute 5.6038325 *25:

5 *25=125.

0.6038325 *25=15.0958125.

So total is 125 +15.0958125=140.0958125.

Now, divide by 7: 140.0958125 /7.

7 *20=140, so 140.0958125 /7=20 + (0.0958125/7).

0.0958125 /7 ≈0.0136875.

So 20.0136875 GeV.

So precisely 20.0136875 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So why is my calculation lower than option C?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the mass. Because, wait, perhaps the nucleus is considered as having a charge, but in the problem statement, the nucleus is moving with speed v. So the mass is that of the nucleus, which I calculated as 5.6038 GeV/c².

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mass of a single nucleon. Wait, no, the nucleus as a whole has a mass of about 6 nucleons, but each nucleon's rest mass is about 0.938 GeV/c². But the nucleus's mass is less than 6 *0.938 due to binding energy, but that would make it around 5.6 GeV, which aligns with my prior calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem considers the nucleus as a proton and neutron, but wait, no, the nucleus is Li-6 with 3 protons and 3 neutrons—so 6 nucleons.

Hmm, perhaps the exact mass of Lithium-6 is different. Let me think: maybe the exact value is 6.015116 u for the nucleus. Wait, maybe I should refer to a more precise source. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is given as 6.015116 u for the bare nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate using a more accurate mass. Let me check a periodic table. Oh, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.017569 u for the atom. So the nucleus would be 6.017569 u - 3 * 0.00054858 u (for the electrons) =6.017569 -0.00164574=6.015923 u, which is what I had before.

So that part is correct.

Hmm. Then my calculation should be correct. So the energy is approx 20.0137 GeV. But none of the options exactly match this. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, I used v=0.96c, so beta is 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28 ≈3.5714.

But let me compute it with more precision.

Wait, 0.96^2 is exactly 0.9216.

1 -0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is exactly 3.571428571.

So that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe the problem expects the use of the rest mass in a different way. For example, perhaps the mass is given as the mass number times the mass of a proton, but that would be incorrect because the mass of a proton is about 1.007 GeV/c², and a neutron is about 0.938 GeV/c². So combining 3 protons and 3 neutrons would give 3*(1.007) +3*(0.938) =3.021 +2.814 =5.835 GeV/c². But that's without considering binding energy, so the actual mass of the nucleus would be slightly less.

Wait, but the exact mass is about 5.6038 GeV/c² as I calculated. So perhaps I should use this value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately, but it's precise enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula in a different way, such as using total energy, which includes kinetic energy, but no, E=gamma mc² is the total energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of m. Let me compute 6.015923 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6.015923 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.015923 *931.5.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.000923 *931.5= approx 0.860.

So 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.860=14.8325.

So total m=5.6038325 GeV/c².

Wait, so E= 3.57142857 *5.6038325.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Let me compute 5.6038325 *3.57142857.

I can write 3.57142857 as 25/7.

So 5.6038325 *25 =140.0958125.

Divide by 7: 140.0958125 /7 =20.0136875 GeV.

So 20.0137 GeV, which is approximately 20.014 GeV.

But looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the mass. Let me check what the exact mass is.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me think: maybe it's about 6.015116 u for the nucleus. Wait, perhaps I got the wrong value earlier.

Wait, if the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.017569 u, and the mass of 3 electrons is 3 *0.00054858 u=0.00164574 u, then the nucleus mass is 6.017569 -0.00164574=6.01592326 u.

But perhaps the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.015116 u. Hmm, that would change things. Let me check:

If the nucleus mass is 6.015116 u, then m=6.015116 *931.5 MeV/c².

6.015116 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5=5589.

0.015116 *931.5.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.000116 *931.5≈0.1083.

So 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.1083=14.0808.

So total m=5589 +14.0808=5603.0808 MeV=5.6030808 GeV.

So m=5.6030808 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * m =3.57142857 *5.6030808.

3.57142857 *5.6030808.

Compute 3 *5.6030808 =16.8092424.

0.57142857 *5.6030808.

0.5 *5.6030808=2.8015404.

0.07142857 *5.6030808≈0.400197.

So 2.8015404 +0.400197=3.2017374.

Adding to 16.8092424: 16.8092424 +3.2017374=20.0109798 GeV.

Approximately 20.011 GeV.

Still, it's around 20.01 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.12 GeV higher. So perhaps there's a mistake in either the mass calculation or perhaps the problem expects using a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. No, because the question asks for the energy of the collider, which is the total energy (gamma mc²), not the kinetic energy (which is (gamma-1) mc²). So I think the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute gamma for v=0.96c.

Wait, beta=0.96, so gamma=1/sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using a more precise value for gamma. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. 0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm. So perhaps I should consider the mass more accurately.

Another thought: perhaps the problem uses the mass of the proton and neutron separately and sums them. Let me try that.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Proton mass: m_p=938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass: m_n=939.565 MeV/c².

So the total mass of 3 protons and 3 neutrons would be 3*(938.272 +939.565)=3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

But the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is less than this because of binding energy. So the actual mass would be 5.633511 GeV minus binding energy. Wait, but the actual mass is about 5.6038 GeV, so the binding energy is about 5.6335 -5.6038=0.0297 GeV, which is about 297 MeV. That's a significant binding energy, but perhaps the problem ignores it, but I don't think so because the mass is given as 6.015923 u, which already accounts for binding energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the atomic mass without subtracting electrons, which would make m larger. Let me try that. If I use m=6.017569 u ×931.5 MeV/u =6.017569 *931.5=?

6 *931.5=5589.

0.017569 *931.5= let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.007 *931.5=6.5205, 0.000569*931.5≈0.529.

So 9.315+6.5205=15.8355 +0.529≈16.3645.

So total m=5589 +16.3645=5605.3645 MeV=5.6053645 GeV.

Then, E=gamma *m =3.57142857 *5.6053645.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6053645.

3 *5.6053645=16.8160935.

0.57142857 *5.6053645.

Compute 0.5 *5.6053645=2.80268225.

0.07142857 *5.6053645≈0.401325.

So 2.80268225 +0.401325=3.20400725.

Adding to 16.8160935: 16.8160935 +3.20400725=20.02010075 GeV.

So approximately 20.0201 GeV. Hmm, still around 20.02 GeV. The options don't have this value. The closest higher option is C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I need to reevaluate. Alternatively, perhaps I should not subtract the electrons' mass. Let me try that approach.

If I use the atomic mass of Li-6 as 6.017569 u, and don't subtract the electrons, then m=6.017569 *931.5 MeV/c².

Compute that:

6 *931.5=5589.

0.017569 *931.5= ?

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.007 *931.5=6.5205.

0.000569 *931.5≈0.529.

So 9.315 +6.5205=15.8355 +0.529=16.3645.

So m=5589 +16.3645=5605.3645 MeV=5.6053645 GeV.

Then E=gamma *m=3.57142857 *5.6053645.

Which we calculated as approximately 20.0201 GeV.

Still, this doesn't match any option exactly.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus in a different way. For example, perhaps it's considering the nucleus as having a mass equal to the sum of the constituent nucleons without considering binding energy. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

m=3*(m_p +m_n) =3*(938.272 +939.565) MeV/c² = 3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

Then, E=3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute that: 3.57142857 *5.633511.

3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511 ≈0.4035.

So total: 2.8167555 +0.4035=3.2202555.

Adding to 16.900533: 16.900533 +3.2202555=20.1207885 GeV.

Approximately 20.1208 GeV.

Now, that's close to option C)20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's about 0.01 GeV higher, which might be due to more precise calculations.

So perhaps the problem expects us to use the sum of the protons and neutrons' masses, neglecting binding energy. So the mass m would be 3*(m_p +m_n) =5.6335 GeV/c².

So E=3.57142857 *5.6335 = 20.12 GeV.

Which is very close to option C)20.132 GeV.

So perhaps that's the correct approach. The problem might be assuming that the mass is the sum of individual nucleons without considering binding energy.

In that case, the answer would be approximately 20.12 GeV, which rounds to option C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus, including binding energy. But given the options, the closest is option C.

So, putting it all together, the energy is approximately 20.12 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV).


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

For \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus (\( m \))
Li-6 has a mass number \( A = 6 \), consisting of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The rest mass of the nucleus is calculated using the atomic mass of Li-6 (\( 6.017569 \, \text{u} \)) minus the mass of 3 electrons (\( 3 \times 0.00054858 \, \text{u} \)):

\[
m_{\text{nucleus}} = 6.017569 \, \text{u} - 0.00164574 \, \text{u} = 6.015923 \, \text{u}
\]

Convert this to GeV/c² using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):

\[
m_{\text{nucleus}} = 6.015923 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 = 5603.83 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 = 5.60383 \, \text{GeV}/c^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy (\( E \))
Using \( E = \gamma m \), where \( \gamma = 3.5714 \) and \( m = 5.60383 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.60383 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.0137 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.0137 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

### Step 5: Reassess using constituent nucleon masses
If the problem assumes the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the protons and neutrons without binding energy, the mass is:

\[
m = 3(m_p + m_n) = 3(938.272 \, \text{MeV} + 939.565 \, \text{MeV}) = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}/c^2
\]

Recalculate \( E \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.1208 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This value is very close to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. Given the problem's phrasing, it likely assumes this approach, making **C** the correct answer.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
