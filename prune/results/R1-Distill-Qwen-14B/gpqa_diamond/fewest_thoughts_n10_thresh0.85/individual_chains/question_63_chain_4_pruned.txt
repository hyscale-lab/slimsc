Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to determine the momentum of a photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state—so that's the lowest energy state? But wait, in quantum mechanics terms, the ground state is the lowest energy. But sometimes, people refer to the 'fundamental state' as the first excited state or maybe the ground state. Hmm, I think in this context, it's the ground state. Because the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotation and vibration. So the molecule is in its lowest energy state, and we need to find the photon's momentum when it absorbs energy to go to the next state.

But wait, what's the next state? Since it's a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next possible state would be either increasing J or increasing v. But photons can cause transitions between these states.

Wait, but the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So which transition would give the smallest energy increase? Because the energy levels for vibration and rotation have different spacing. The vibrational energy levels are higher in spacing than rotational. So if the molecule is in the ground state, the next possible higher energy state would be the next vibrational state (v=1) because that's a bigger jump than increasing J by 1. Hmm, but wait, the question is about a photon causing a transition. So I need to find which transition (vibrational or rotational) would require the least energy, and then calculate the photon's momentum based on that.

Wait no, the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's the lowest energy transition possible. Like, if the molecule can absorb a photon that causes a transition to a lower energy state than other possibilities. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, and we want to find the photon that allows it to switch to the next state of the lowest possible energy. Oh wait, perhaps the next state refers to the next higher energy state, but the one that requires the least energy to reach. So the photon's energy should match the smallest possible energy difference between two states.

So what are the possible transitions from the ground state (v=0, J=0)? The next possible states would be either increasing J (like J=1) or increasing v (v=1). Let's compute the energy differences for each.

First, let's compute the rotational energy. The energy levels for a rigid rotor are given by E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) * J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. But wait, the non-rigid rotor model is more accurate, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps the rigid rotor approximation is sufficient because it's a diatomic molecule.

The moment of inertia I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length. So I'll need to calculate μ.

Masses of X and Y are given as Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) )= 40 /22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that: 1.818 * 1.66 is around 3.01 (since 1.8 *1.66 is 2.988, 0.018*1.66≈0.0
