Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data, then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, okay, let's start with the spectroscopic data.

The IR data has peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an -OH stretch or maybe an =NH. But wait, the other IR peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The 1720 is a strong peak, so that could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids typically have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm-1. The IR here shows a broad region from 3400–2500, which might suggest an O-H from a carboxylic acid. Oh, but wait, maybe it's an alcohol or an amide as well. Hmm.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

So, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet but broad, which makes me think it's an -OH proton. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, that OH would be broad, but usually around 10-12 ppm. So that fits. So that might support the IR idea of a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but that's more like 9.5-10. But the integration is 1H, which could fit either an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but looking at the other NMR signals. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm doublets each integrating to 2H each. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets indicate coupling between adjacent protons, so for a para-substituted benzene, that would make sense. Like, perhaps a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

Wait, if it's para-substituted, maybe it's something like a para-xylene (dimethyl benzene) but with other substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, each being different groups.

Wait, looking at the downfield region, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the adjacent protons would be in the aromatic ring. Oh, wait, but the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2. So if the substituent is a carboxylic acid group, then the ring would have a COOH group and another substituent. Let me think. Because if the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, that could mean that they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl.

Wait, the IR also shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which fits a carbonyl, probably from a ketone or a carboxylic acid. But if the compound has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring with substituents, that could fit.

Let me consider the possible structure. The aromatic region in the NMR suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents. So, maybe one substituent is a carboxylic acid group, and the other is an alkyl chain.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to something, maybe a carbonyl. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be -CH2- groups, perhaps as part of an isopropyl or butyl group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) might be a methyl group attached to a CH, like a CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggests a terminal methyl, like in an ethyl or butyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me think: benzoic acid has the COOH group. If the substituent on the benzene is a sec-butyl group in the para position, then the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me see.

Wait, let me draw this out mentally. The benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a substituent at position 4. The substituent is a sec-butyl group. The sec-butyl group would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, no. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2 attached to a CH2? Hmm, wait, let me think. Wait, butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3. iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-. Wait, no, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), no. Wait, no, iso-butyl is (CH3)2CH- as a substituent. Wait, no, iso-butyl is CH(CH3)2, but that's the substituent. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the substituent in question is a sec-butyl group, which would be a four-carbon chain where the branching is on the second carbon. The structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no. Let me see: butyl is four carbons. The structure of sec-butyl would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Wait, butyl groups can be n-, iso-, or sec-. For sec-butyl, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2CH2CH3) attached via the second carbon. Wait, but that's not making sense. Let me think again.

Butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3 attached from the first carbon. iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-, attached from the first carbon. Wait, no, iso-butyl is (CH3)2CH-. Oh wait, the substit
