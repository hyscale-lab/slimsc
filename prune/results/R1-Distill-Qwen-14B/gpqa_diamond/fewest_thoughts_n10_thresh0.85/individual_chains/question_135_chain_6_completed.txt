Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄ f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I'm a bit rusty on my Lagrangians, but I think this represents an interaction term between the boson X and some fermions.

Wait, right. The Lagrangian is usually the interaction part when written like that. So, the term λf ψ̄ (v + X) ψ would imply that the fermion ψ interacts with the scalar X, right? So X is a boson field, and the fermions it interacts with are given by ψ_f. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to find all possible fermion-antifermion pairs that X can decay into.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because energy and momentum conservation require that the rest mass of the boson is enough to create the particles at rest.

So, the allowed decays are those where the sum of the fermion masses is less than or equal to the boson mass. But wait, the X is a scalar, so for a decay X → f f̄, the fermions must have masses such that 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So, m_X is 6 GeV. Let me list the masses of all the known fermions to see which pairs are possible.

The known fermion masses (approximate):

- Electron (e): 0.000511 GeV
- Muon (μ): 0.1057 GeV
- Tau (τ): 1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): around 173 GeV

Wait, but wait. The top quark is way heavier than X's mass, so X can't decay into top quarks. Because 2m_t is way higher than 6 GeV.

So, looking at each fermion pair:

1. b quark: m_b ~4.5 GeV. 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b b̄.

Wait wait, that's a problem. Because 4.5 *2 is 9, which is bigger than 6. So X can't decay into b quarks.

Wait, but looking at the options, some include b b̄ in the decay, others don't.

Let me check the options again.

Option A includes b b̄, so that would be possible if 2m_b ≤6 GeV. But 4.5*2=9>6, so that's not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-, mu+ mu-.

Wait, let's compute 2m for each fermion:

- c: 1.27 GeV each → 2.54 GeV. 6 GeV is much bigger, so allowed.
- s: ~0.19 GeV each → 0.38 ≤6 → allowed.
- u: 0.0022 → 0.0044 → allowed.
- d: 0.0047 → 0.0094 → allowed.
- tau: 1.777 each → 3.554 GeV. 3.554 <6 → allowed.
- e: 0.001 GeV → 0.002 → allowed.
- mu: 0.1057 → 0.2114 → allowed.

So all these in option B are allowed. But wait, what about the b quark? 4.5*2=9>6, so can't decay into b.

So why are some options including b? Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the b quark. I thought it's around 4.5 GeV. Let me confirm.

Wait, according to standard model, the bottom quark mass is about 4.1 to 4.7 GeV. So 2m_b is about 8.2 to 9.4 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, which is less than 8.2, so 2m_b exceeds m_X. So X can't decay into b b̄. So any option including b would be incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b, s, u, d, tau, e. So b is not allowed, so A is wrong.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All allowed, except perhaps the tau's 2m is 3.55 which is under 6. So B is a possibility.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is 173 GeV, so 2m_t is 346 GeV, way higher. So C can't be correct.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Again, b is not allowed, so D is wrong.

So the correct option should be B, which includes all the allowed fermions except t and b.

Wait, but wait a moment. The question says "fermions" in general. So could the fermions be any possible, like neutrinos? Because neutrinos are very light, but the problem states the interaction is with fermions, but the given interaction is with ψ_f, which I think refers to the same fermions.

Wait, the Lagrangian term is -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So this is a Yukawa-like interaction, implying that X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So the fermions in the decay products must be the ones that X can couple to, as per the interaction term.

So in the Lagrangian, X couples to ψ_f, which are the same fermions that decay into. So the possible decay products are the same fermions that interact with X.

Wait, but the mass of the fermion is important. So for each fermion f, m_f must be ≤ m_X / 2.

So the possible fermions f must satisfy m_f ≤ 3 GeV (since 6 GeV /2 =3 GeV).

Looking at the fermion masses:

- c: ~1.27 GeV → allowed.
- b: ~4.5 GeV → not allowed.
- t: way too big.
- tau: ~1.777 GeV → allowed.
- mu: 0.1 GeV → allowed.
- e: 0.0005 GeV → allowed.
- u: ~0.002 GeV → allowed.
- d: ~0.004 GeV → allowed.
- s: ~0.1 GeV → allowed.

So all fermions except the b and t are allowed. So the possible decays are into pairs of each of these.

Wait, but the given options don't include all. Let me look again.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed, so it's incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian, \(-\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f (v + X) \psi_f\), indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \). For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be allowed, the mass of the boson must satisfy \( m_X \geq 2m_f \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

The masses of the known fermions are approximately:

- \( m_e \approx 0.000511 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_\mu \approx 0.1057 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_u \approx 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \).

For \( X \) to decay into \( f \bar{f} \), \( 2m_f \) must be less than or equal to \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This condition is satisfied for the following fermions:

- \( e \), \( \mu \), \( \tau \): \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( u \), \( d \), \( s \), \( c \): \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

However, the \( b \)-quark (\( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)) and \( t \)-quark (\( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) are excluded because \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
