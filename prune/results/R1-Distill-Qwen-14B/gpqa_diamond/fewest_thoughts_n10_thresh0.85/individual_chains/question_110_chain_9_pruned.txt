Okay, I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, let's think through this. The question is asking which stars can be observed with both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. 

I remember that the brightness of a star determines whether a telescope's spectrograph can detect it. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can see those brighter than 16. So the star needs to be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Oh no, wait, I think I got that backwards. Because the fainter the magnitude, the brighter the star. So if a star's V magnitude is lower than a certain value, it's brighter and can be observed.

Wait, the problem says: With ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So ESPRESSO can see stars with V ≤ 17? Because higher magnitude numbers mean dimmer. So the apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO to see it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, meaning apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, right, because magnitude is a counterintuitive scale. So a star with V mag 17 is brighter than 18, but dimmer than 16. So if the limit is brighter than 17, that would mean apparent magnitudes less than or equal to 17, right? Because a magnitude of 17 is brighter than 18, but dimmer than 16.

So for a star to be detected by both, it needs to be brighter than both 17 mag (for ESPRESSO) and 16 mag (for HIRES). Wait, no. Because ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17, which means V ≤17. HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, which means V ≤16. So for both to detect it, the star's V mag must be ≤16. Because if it's V=16, then
