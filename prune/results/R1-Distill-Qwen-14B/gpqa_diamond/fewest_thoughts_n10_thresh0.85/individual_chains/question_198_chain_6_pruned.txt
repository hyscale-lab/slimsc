Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of problems. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate ions, and some stability constants for the complexes. Hmm.

So, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration [Co] is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands, but here β4 is lower than β3. Hmm, that's interesting. Maybe the complexes areCo(SCN)_n, where n is the number of ligands.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think that refers to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is usually blue. So, that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ species. So, the percentage is of that specific complex relative to all cobalt species.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I remember that the distribution of metal complexes depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The idea is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex that exists in solution and then find the percentage for the desired one.

The possible complexes are probably Co(SCN)_0, Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4. But wait, the stability constants given are β1 to β4. I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^0, and β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^-. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact charges. Let me think again.

Cobalt(II) is Co^2+. Each SCN^- is -1. So the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2 -n}. So, for n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ (since 2-1=+1). For n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (2-2=0). Wait, no, 2-2=0? No, wait: Co is +2, each SCN is -1. So for n=2, the charge is 2+2*(-1)=0. So yes, neutral. But I'm not sure about the exact complexes, but maybe that's okay.

The general approach is to find the fraction of each complex. But since the problem is asking for the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, I'll focus on that.

Wait, but the problem says "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, perhaps? Or maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check: each SCN is -1, so Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So neutral. That's the species for n=2.

So, the distribution of the species can be found using the formation constants and the concentrations. But the problem is, with four different β values, I might need to calculate the fraction of each species.

Wait, but this might get complicated because there are four possible complexes. Maybe I can use the method of successive approximations or the formation of each complex step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using the concept of conditional formation constants or using the fraction of each species based on their β values and the ligand concentration.

I think the formula for the distribution of each species is given by the fraction ni = (βi * [L]^i) / (1 + sum_{k=0}^{n} βk [L]^k)), but wait, no. The general approach is that the fraction of a complex is (β_i [L]^i) divided by the sum over all j of (β_j [L]^j).

Wait, wait. Let me think. The fraction for each complex is (β_n [L]^n )/(sum from m=0 to 4 of β_m [L]^m ), right? Because the total concentration of Co is the sum of all species, each being a different complex.

But wait, [L] is the concentration of the ligand. In this case, [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M. But does that include the SCN used in the complexes? Oh, wait, the solution has free [SCN^-] and the complexes. So when calculating the fraction, the [L] is the free ligand concentration. But wait, in such problems, sometimes the approach is to assume that the free ligand concentration is given, and the complexes are formed from that.

Wait, but the total ligand concentration is [SCN^-]_total = [free SCN^-] + sum over all complexes of (n * [complex]). But if the solution is such that the ligand is in excess, then the free [SCN^-] can be approximated as the given 0.1 M. Is 0.1 M high enough compared to the complexes? Let me think: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. Each complex uses up n SCN- per Co^2+.

For example, if all Co is in the form [Co(SCN)_4]^-, that would require 4 * 1e-2 = 4e-2 M of SCN-. But the total [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is much larger than 4e-2. So the free SCN^- is about 0.1 - (sum n_i [Co_i]), where [Co_i] is the concentration of each complex. But given that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and the maximum possible consumption is 4e-2 M, the free [SCN^-] would be about 0.06 M. But wait, that's a significant change. So perhaps the free ligand isn't just 0.1 M, but that complicates things.

This makes me think that maybe the problem is assuming that the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the given [SCN^-], which is 0.1 M. Or perhaps they are using a different approximation.

Alternatively, in such problems, sometimes the free ligand concentration is considered much higher than the [M], so that the free ligand doesn't change much when the complexes form. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the free [SCN^-] is approximately 0.1 M, so that we can proceed with that value without considering the change.

If that's the case, then the fraction of each complex can be found by:

f_i = β_i [SCN^-]^i / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN^-]^k )

But wait, wait. Wait, when i=0, the complex is Co^2+ with no ligands, so β0 is 1, but the question doesn't give β0. Hmm. Oh, because the given β starts at β1=9. So perhaps the complexes are Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, etc., but the Co^2+ itself is considered as the zeroth complex. So the β0 is 1. So the sum would be from k=0 to 4, with β0=1, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but that doesn't add up. Let me think: the stability constant βn is for the complex Co(SCN)_n. So for n=0, it's Co^2+; β0 is 1. For n=1, it's Co(SCN)^+, β1=9. For n=2, β2=40. n=3, β3=63. n=4, β4=16.

So the problem is to find the fraction of n=2 complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So the total fraction is f_2 = (β2 [SCN^-]^2 ) / (sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN^-]^k )

Wait, but wait. Each term in the denominator is β_k multiplied by [SCN^-]^k. So for each k, [SCN^-]^k is the concentration used per complex.

So let's compute each term.

Given [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Compute for each k=0 to 4:

Term_k = β_k * (0.1)^k

Sum all term_k from k=0 to 4, then f2 is term_2 / sum.

Wait, but β0 is 1, right? Because β0 = [Co(SCN)_0]/[Co][SCN^0] = 1.

Wait, but in the given problem, the β values start at β1=9. So the scenario is that the possible complexes are [Co], [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

So, the formula for the fraction would be:

f_2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (β0 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

But since β0 is 1, and β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So let's compute each term:

Term0: β0 * (0.1)^0 = 1 * 1 =1

Term1: 9 * (0.1) =0.9

Term2:40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4

Term3: 63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063

Term4:16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Now sum all terms:

sum = 1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = let's calculate:

1 +0.9 =1.9

1.9 +0.4 =2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator is about 2.3646.

The term for f2 is term2=0.4.

So f2= 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ ?

Calculating that: 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute 0.4 / 2.3646.

Well, 2.3646 is approximately 2.365.

0.4 / 2.365 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%.

Wait, but the options are A)42.3%,
