Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it says we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The particles can move along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Interesting. Oh wait, the question is about finding the value of 'a' such that when we measure the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3, not less than 1 or greater than 3.

Right, so in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a certain region is given by the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function (the probability density) over that region. And for a normalized wave function, the integral over all space should be 1. But in this case, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, which suggests that the wave function is zero outside this interval, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right because the wave function shouldn't be zero outside. Or maybe I misunderstood the setup.

Wait, the problem says that when measuring the position, none were found at x <1 and x>3. So all the particles are in the region between 1 and 3. That probably means that the wave function is zero outside this region, but the given wave function is non-zero in that area. So perhaps the given expression is only valid in 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the wave function is non-zero in that area, but the rest is zero.

But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's a complex function. Oh, right, because wave functions can be complex. But for the probability density, we take the absolute square. So the probability density is |ψ(x)|².

So to normalize the wave function, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should be equal to 1, because all the probability is in that interval.

Let me write down the wave function ψ(x). It's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. So the absolute square would be [ (a / sqrt(1+x) )^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because when you square a complex number a + ib, you get a² + b². Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - (0.5)i. So ψ(x) = A - Bi, where A = a/sqrt(1+x), B=0.5.

The absolute value squared is |ψ(x)|² = (A)^2 + (B)^2. Because when you have a complex number, say, (a + ib), its absolute square is a² + b².

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1 + x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1, because the wave function is normalized.

So the integral becomes ∫ (a²)/(1 + x) dx from 1 to 3 + ∫ (0.5)^2 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let me compute each part.

First, the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3:

Integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C. So evaluated from 1 to 3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln 2, and ln(2) is just ln 2. So 2 ln 2 - ln 2 = ln 2.

So the first part is a² ln 2.

Second, the integral of (0.5)^2 dx from 1 to 3. (0.5)^2 is 0.25. So 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So adding the two parts: a² ln 2 + 0.5 = 1.

So the equation is:

a² ln 2 + 0.5 = 1

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² ln 2 = 0.5

So a² = 0.5 / ln 2

Let me compute ln 2. I remember ln 2 is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when taking the absolute square, yes, it's (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

The integral from 1 to 3:

∫ (a²)/(1+x) dx = a² [ln(1+x)] from 1 to 3 = a² (ln4 - ln2) = a² ln2.

Then the other term: 0.25*(3-1)=0.5.

So equation:

a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1 → a² = 0.5 / ln 2.

Calculate 0.5 / ln2:

0.5 is 0.5, ln2 is ~0.6931.

0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So option B is correct.


To determine the value of \(a\), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the wave function is normalized, the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over the region \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)

   The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\). Thus:

   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\)

   The integral of \(0.25\) over \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) is:

   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is closest to option **B) 0.85**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
