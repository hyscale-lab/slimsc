Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me read it again carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones through the nucleophilic substitution. But wait, ketones usually don't undergo nucleophilic substitution unless there's a leaving group. Oh wait, but I think in the presence of a strong base, the ketone can be deprotonated to form an enolate, which can then attack a nitrile group. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up some concepts here.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions, perhaps it's a cyanide addition. Oh right, I think the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone reacts with a nitrile (like NaCN) in the presence of a strong acid. The acid protonates the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, and water leaves, forming a cyanohydrin.

So the product from the first reaction would have a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. That matches 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So for the first step, the reagent A must be an acid catalyst, probably something like H3O+ (since that's a common strong acid). So looking at the options, reagent A in options A and B is H3O+.

But wait, another possibility is that maybe the reaction uses something else. Oh, I just remembered that sometimes HCN is used, but in this case, the question states that NaCN is used, which provides the CN- and the reaction is probably done under acidic conditions. So yes, reagent A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: the starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, but wait, no, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So that's a more complex molecule, but the structure is similar. The reaction is with reagent B in H2O, yielding the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Converting nitriles to carboxylic acids. How does that happen? I think it's through hydrolysis. The typical way to do that is under acidic or basic conditions with water. For nitriles to acids, the usual methods are hydrolysis. Under acidic conditions, you might use H3O+ and heat. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you use OH- and then acidify.

Wait, but in the options, reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH. Wait, the reagents are in H2O, so it's a hydrolysis reaction. So for nitrile to carboxylic acid, the general reaction is in H2O with an acid catalyst. Alternatively, sometimes HCl is used as a catalyst.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the nitrile is first converted to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. But I think in this case, it's more direct. Nitrile hydrolysis typically needs strong acid or base. Under acidic conditions, when you hydrolyze a nitrile, you get a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B would be HCl (HCl is a strong acid, so perhaps that's the catalyst).

Alternatively, if B is acetic acid, that's a weaker acid. Would that work? Maybe not, because the hydrolysis might require a stronger acid to proceed.

Looking at the options, option A says B is HCl, option B says B is CH3COOH, option C is HCl, D is CH3COOH.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is likely HCl, which is a strong acid, making it the catalyst for the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid.

So putting it together, reagent A is H3O+ (so options A or B) and reagent B is HCl (so options A or C).
