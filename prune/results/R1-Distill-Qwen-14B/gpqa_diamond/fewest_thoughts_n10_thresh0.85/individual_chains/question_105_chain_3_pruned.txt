Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun, but it has some dark spots on one hemisphere. The problem is asking about the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots do. 

Wait, so the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, I think. Oh right, the temperature difference is 1000 K. So the spots are 5000 K? Or is it 6000 +1000? No, wait, stars usually have spots that are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so the spots would be 5000 K. So the star is 6000 K, spots 5000 K.

The filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, I think. So one hemisphere—so the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere. Because the star is a sphere, the total surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². So the area covered is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². 

When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing changes in brightness. The star's light curve would dip when a spot is facing us because the spot is darker. But since the spots are on one hemisphere, only when that side is facing us do we see the dip. So the brightness variation is due to the difference in brightness between the spotted and unspotted regions.

Now, the problem says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would cause the same amplitude in the light curve. So the planet transiting the star would block some of the light, causing a dip. The amplitude of that dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.

But wait, the spots are causing a dip too. So we need to calculate the amplitude of the dip caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude.

Let me think about the brightness variation. The star's total brightness is the sum of all the areas emitting light. When the spots are on the front hemisphere, a portion of the star's light is reduced. 

I remember the formula for the change in brightness when a cooler region is observed. The flux from the star without spots is F0 = σTeff^4 per unit area. The spots have a lower temperature, T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K. 

The change in flux when the spot is visible is the difference between the original flux and the spot's flux. But because the spot covers a certain area, the total change is the area of the spot multiplied by the difference in flux per unit area.

Wait, the flux from the spot is F_spot = σ*(5000)^4,
