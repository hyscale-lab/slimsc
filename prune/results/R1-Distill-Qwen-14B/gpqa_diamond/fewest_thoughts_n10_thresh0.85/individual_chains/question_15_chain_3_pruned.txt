Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let me try to think it through.

So, the scenario is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because that would make it easier to detect. They have limited time, so they need to pick the better candidate.

Wait, what do I know about transit probabilities? I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the orbit. Oh right, the formula for transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / R_star), or wait, no, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a), but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)), but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with the formula for the transit depth. Let me think again.

Oh wait, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk. So that's (R_p / R_s)^2. But wait, no, that's the depth, not the probability. The probability of a transit is the chance that the planet's orbit, from our point of view, aligns such that it passes in front of the star. So that's more about the orbital geometry.

I think the probability of transit is given by (R_star + R_planet) / (a), but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (R_p / R_s)^2))^(1/2))... Wait, no, I'm getting confused with other factors.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit intersects our line of sight) is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_star + R_planet) / (a) multiplied by (something else). Or maybe another formula entirely.

Wait, let me think about it. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the star and planet and the size of the orbit. The formula I recall is P = (R_s + R_p) / a, but that doesn't seem right dimensionally. Wait, no, the actual formula is P = (R_p + R_s) / (a * (1 - e^2)^0.5), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so it's (R_p + R_s)/a. But wait, that can't be right because if a is large, the probability is lower, which makes sense. But for Earth-like planets, R_p is much smaller than R_s, so it's approximately R_s / a.

Wait, but I might be mixing up the formula. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a). Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the relative orbital size factor. Let me try to find the correct formula in my memory.

Oh! I think the correct formula for the probability of a transit is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively
