Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. And X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. So wait, Li has an atomic number of 3, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons total.

So the nucleus is Li-6. I need to find the energy of the collider when the speed is 0.96c. I remember that in particle physics, the energy depends on the relativistic gamma factor.

Gamma (γ) is given by the equation γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in. Let me compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 * c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that: sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So 1 / 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714? Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. Hmm, 0.96 squared is 0.9216, yes. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784). So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.571428... So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the energy of the particle is given by E = γ * m * c². But wait, m here is the rest mass of the nucleus. So I need to find the rest mass of Li-6.

Li has an atomic number of 3. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². Wait, I think the exact values are a bit different. Let me recall: protons are approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and neutrons are around 939.565 MeV/c². But to make it easier, perhaps I can use the average or approximate each as about 938 MeV. Wait, but maybe the exact values matter for precise calculation, especially since the options are precise to four decimal places.

So, calculating the rest mass of Li-6:

Number of protons: 3. Each proton has mass m_p ≈ 938.272 MeV/c².

Number of neutrons: 3. Each neutron has mass m_n ≈ 939.565 MeV/c².

So total rest mass m = 3*(m_p + m_n) ? Wait, no. Wait, the nucleus is a combination of protons and neutrons, but the actual mass is the sum minus any binding energy. Oh wait, wait, but in particle physics, when dealing with high-energy physics like colliders, the rest mass is approximated as the sum of the individual nucleon masses minus the binding energy, but binding energy is usually small compared to the rest mass of the nucleons.
