Okay, so I have this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass. But the host stars have different masses and same radii. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but their radii are the same. Oh, and Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. So that means Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, right? Because using Kepler's third law, the period depends on the distance cubed over mass.

So the formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (a - R_star)) )^2 or something like that? Or is it more like (R_p / R_s)^2 times [something related to orbital distance and star size]. Wait, I think the probability is proportional to (Rp/Rs)^2 multiplied by (a/(R_s * something))... No, wait, the main factors are the planet-to-star size ratio squared and the probability that the planet's orbit intersects our line of sight, which depends on the ratio of the star's size to the orbital distance.

Wait, the transit probability is higher when the orbital plane is edge-on. The probability is given by (R_star / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis (distance from star), assuming circular orbits. So the probability P is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2. Because R_p is the planet's radius, R_s the star's, and a the orbital distance.

Wait, let me get this right. The geometric probability of a transit is (R_p + R_s) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately R_s / a. So the probability scales as (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s^2 / a^2) )? Or wait, no. Let me think again.

Transit probability is the ratio of the area where the planet's orbit can cause a transit when viewed edge-on. So the probability is roughly (R_p + R_s)/(a) * something, but I think the exact formula is (R_p / a)^2 * ( (R_s + R
