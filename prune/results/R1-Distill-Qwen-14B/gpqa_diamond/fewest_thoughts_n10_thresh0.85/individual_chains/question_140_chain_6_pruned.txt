Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and it's a bit tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is used too.

Hmm, let's start by figuring out the possible substances involved. 

First, let's think about the gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each atom in the molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. A molecule where each atom is something like deuterium (since D has 1 proton and 1 neutron), but wait, D is a gas, but the molecule could be something else. Alternatively, the molecule could be something like O2 or N2, but no, wait. Let me think. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons in each molecule. Wait, no, the molecule as a whole has same number of protons and neutrons. Wait no, the question says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So the molecule's total protons = total neutrons.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So for example, H2O has 10 protons (H2 has 2, O has 8) and neutrons would be 8 (from O) + 2*(0 from H) = 8. So protons 10, neutrons 8. Not equal. What about CO2? C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So CO2 has 6 + 16=22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (assuming 12C), each O has 8, so 6 + 16=22. Oh wait, that would make 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So CO2 would fit. But wait, is that correct? Let me check: CO2 has one C and two O. C has 6 protons, each O has 8, so total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C is 12-6=6, each O is 16-8=8. So 6 + 2*8=22. So yes, same number. But CO2 is a gas. Another possibility is CH4. Let's see: C has 6 protons, H4 has 4. Total protons: 6+4=10. Neutrons: C has 6, H has 0 each. So 6+0=6. Not equal. So not CH4. Another possibility, maybe NH3: N has 7 protons, H3: 3. Total protons: 10. Neutrons: N has 7-7=0? Wait no, wait. Nitrogen has 7 protons, so if it's 14N, it has 7 neutrons. Each H has 0. So total neutrons: 7. Protons: 7 (N) +3 (H)=10. So 10 protons, 7 neutrons. Not equal. So CO2 seems a possibility.

Wait another thought: what about N2? Each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if 14N). So N2 has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that would fit. But does N2 fit the release scenario? Let me think about the reaction.

So X reacts with Y to produce gas W. Y is a liquid. Common reactions that produce gases when a solid reacts with a liquid are things like metal and acid reactions. Maybe Y is water or another liquid.

Wait, but W could be a gas like CO2 or N2. Alternatively, maybe H2? Because H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (since H is 1H), so no, that doesn't fit. Wait, let me think again. For W, the molecule must have the same number of protons and neutrons in total. So another possibility: H2O. Let's see, protons: 2 + 8 =10, neutrons: 0 (from H) + 8 (O)=8. Not equal. So no.

Wait, what about O3? O3 has 3 atoms, each with 8 protons. So total protons: 24. Neutrons: each O is 16-8=8. So 3*8=24. So 24 protons, 24 neutrons. So O3 is a possible W. But O3 is a gas, but I'm not sure about the reaction context.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like NO. Let's see: NO has one N and one O. Protons: 7 +8=15. Neutrons: N has 7 (since 14N is common) and O has 8. So 7 +8=15. So same number. That works. So NO is another possibility. But NO is a reactive gas, maybe.

But let's think about the reaction: X reacts with Y to produce W. If X is a metal or metalloid reacting with an acid (Y as acid), producing a gas. For example, a carbonate reacting with acid produces CO2. So if X is a carbonate, Y could be an acid.

Wait, but the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X is something like sodium nitrate, which is NaNO3. Wait, but then the reaction with HCl (Y as acid
