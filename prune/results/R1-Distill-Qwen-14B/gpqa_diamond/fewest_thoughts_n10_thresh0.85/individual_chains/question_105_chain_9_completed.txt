Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and honestly, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem says that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into view and then go away, causing brightness variations that look like those caused by a planet transiting the star.

The question is asking, if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet causing the same brightness variation, what would the exoplanet's radius be relative to the star's radius? The options are A to D.

Hmm. So I remember that the brightness dip when a planet transits a star is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of the radius. But wait, in this case, the brightness variation isn't due to a planet but spots. So I need to figure out how the spots affect the brightness and then set that equal to the planet's effect.

Wait, the star's brightness comes from its surface area, but the spots are darker and cooler. So when the spots rotate into view, the total brightness decreases because those cooler areas are contributing less. But how does that compare to a planet blocking the light?

Wait, I think the problem is saying that the observed brightness variation from the spots is the same as if a planet were transiting. So I need to calculate what planet radius would cause the same dip as the spots. So the first step is to find the brightness variation caused by the spots, then find the planet radius that would cause the same variation.

Let me think about the star's normal brightness. The star's luminosity is given by L = 4πσR²Teff^4. But when there are spots, the effective temperature isn't uniform. The spots are cooler, so their contribution is less.

The filling factor (f) is 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So the total area of the spots is f multiplied by the area of one hemisphere. The area of a sphere is 4πR², so one hemisphere is 2πR². So the area of the spots is f * 2πR². Since f is 0.2, that's 0.4πR².

Wait, but each spot is cooler. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. So each spot emits less radiation.

The total flux from the star when the spots are visible would be the normal flux minus the flux from the spots plus the flux from the cooler spots. Wait, no, actually, the spots are areas where the star is cooler, so the total flux from the star would decrease.

But the brightness variation is about how much the total flux changes when the spots rotate into view. Let me model this.

The star's total flux without any spots would be L = 4πσR²(6000)^4.

When there are spots, the flux from the spots is less. The area of the spots is A_spots = f * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR².

The flux from the spots is A_spots * σT_spot^4.

So the change in flux when the spots are visible is the difference between the normal flux and the flux when the spots are present.

Wait, actually, the star's total flux when the spots are visible would be L_total = L - (normal flux from spots area) + (flux from spots).

Wait, no, the star's overall flux is the sum of the non-spots areas and the spots areas.

L_total = (Area_non_spots * σTeff^4) + (Area_spots * σT_spot^4).

The area_non_spots is the total area of the star (4πR²) minus the area of the spots (0.4πR²). So area_non_spots = (4πR² - 0.4πR²) = 3.6πR².

So L_total = [3.6πR² * σ(6000)^4] + [0.4πR² * σ(5000)^4].

The variation in flux when the spots rotate into view (compared to when they're not visible) is the difference between L (when spots are not visible) and L_total (when spots are visible).

Wait, but when the spots are on the far side, the observed flux is the normal L. When they rotate to the front, the flux drops because of the spots. So the dip is L - L_total.

Let me compute L and L_total.

L = 4πσR² (6000)^4.
L_total = [3.6πR² * (6000)^4 + 0.4πR² (5000)^4] * σ.

So the dip is (L - L_total) / L = [4πσR² (6000)^4 - (3.6πR² (6000)^4 + 0.4πR² (5000)^4)] / [4πσR² (6000)^4 ].

Let me compute this fraction.

Factor out πσR² (6000)^4 from numerator and denominator.

Numerator: [4 (6000)^4 - 3.6 (6000)^4 - 0.4 (5000)^4 / (6000)^4 ) ] * πσR² (6000)^4.

Wait, maybe I should compute each term.

Alternatively, let's compute each coefficient.

Compute 3.6 + 0.4 = 4, which is the same as the original 4 in L, as expected.

Wait, but the terms inside L_total are 3.6 * (6000)^4 and 0.4 * (5000)^4.

So the dip is L - L_total = 4*(6000^4) - [3.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)].

So that's 4a - (3.6 a + 0.4 b) where a=6000^4 and b=5000^4.

So 4a - 3.6a - 0.4b = 0.4a - 0.4b = 0.4(a - b).

So the dip is (0.4 (a - b)) / L.

But L is 4πσR² a. So:

Dip = [0.4 (a - b) ] / (4a) = 0.4 (a - b) / (4 a) ) = 0.1 (a - b)/(a) = 0.1 (1 - (b/a)).

Compute (b/a) = (5000^4)/(6000^4) = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333. 0.8333^4 is roughly 0.8333 * 0.8333 = ~0.694, then 0.694^2 ≈ 0.482.

Wait, more accurately: (5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.0517747.

So the dip is approximately 5.177% of the star's luminosity.

Wait, but that's the dip caused by the spots. So the relative brightness change is about 5.18%.

Now, if instead of spots, the same dip is caused by a planet transiting the star, what would the planet's radius be?

The dip when a planet transits is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So the dip fraction f_planet = (R_p / R_star)^2.

We have f_planet = 0.0517747.

So R_p / R_star = sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the dip from the planet is when the planet blocks the star's light. So the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2. So in our case, the dip due to the spots is about 5.18%, so the planet's dip should be the same.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the spots are on one hemisphere. So as the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away, so the maximum dip would be when the entire spot area is visible. But the period of rotation would determine the duration, but since the question is only about the amplitude, it's the same as a planet transit.

Wait, so the dip from the spots is about 5.18%, so the planet's dip is R_p squared over R_star squared equals 0.0518.

Taking the square root: ~0.2276, or about 22.76% of the star's radius.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none of the options is about 0.23. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, maybe I messed up the way I calculated the dip.

Let me double-check.

The star's total luminosity without spots is L = 4πσR² (6000)^4.

When the spots are visible, the luminosity is L_total = (3.6πR²) * σ(6000)^4 + (0.4πR²) * σ(5000)^4.

So the dip is (L - L_total)/L.

Which is [4a - (3.6a + 0.4b)]/(4a) = [0.4a - 0.4b]/4a.

Wait, 0.4(a - b)/(4a) = 0.1 (a - b)/a = 0.1 (1 - (b/a)).

Wait, I'm confident in that calculation. So (b/a) is (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.051775, so about 5.1775% dip.

So the dip is about 5.18%.

So the planet's (R_p / R*)^2 = 0.05177.

So R_p = sqrt(0.05177) * R*.

Wait, sqrt(0.05177) is approximately 0.2276, which is about 22.76% of R*.

But the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm. My calculation doesn't match any of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the dip. Another approach: maybe the problem is considering that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, only part of the spots are visible. Wait, no, the problem says one hemisphere is covered, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view as a whole, so the maximum dip is when all the spots are visible.

Wait, perhaps the way I calculated the dip is incorrect. Maybe I should calculate the change in flux when the spots are on the far side versus when they're facing us, but perhaps I got it reversed.

Wait, when the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower because you're seeing the cooler spots. When the spots are on the far side, you see the full star. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully facing us.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the star's brightness without spots is L. When the spots are visible, the brightness is L * (1 - f + f * (T_spot / T_star)^4).

Wait, because f is the fraction of the area in spots, and each spot emits (T_spot / T_star)^4 times the star's flux.

So the brightness when spots are visible is L * (1 - f) * 1 + f * (T_spot / T_star)^4.

Wait, more accurately, the flux from the spots is f * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4). So the total flux from the star when spots are visible is L * [ (1 - f) * 1 + f * (T_spot / T_star)^4 ].

So the relative brightness is [ (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_star)^4 ].

So the dip is [1 - ( (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_star)^4 ) ].

Which is 1 - [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_star^4) ].

Simplify: 1 - 1 + f - f (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 ) = f [ 1 - (T_spot^4 / T_star^4) ].

So the dip is f [1 - (Ts^4 / T*^4) ].

Ah! That's a simpler way to compute it. So I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation. Let me do it this way.

Given f = 0.2, Ts = 5000 K, T* = 6000 K.

So dip = 0.2 [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ].

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.833333.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355, or about 10.355% dip.

Ah, that's about 10.35% dip.

Wait, that's a different result than before. I must have messed up the first approach. So why the discrepancy?

In my first approach, I considered the entire area of the star and the area of the spots. But perhaps the correct way is to model it as the fraction f of the area in spots, each contributing (Ts^4) instead of (T*^4). So the flux when spots are visible is (1 - f) * T*^4 + f * Ts^4, all divided by T*^4 (since the star's normal flux is T*^4 per unit area). So the relative flux is (1 - f) + f*(Ts^4 / T*^4).

So the dip is (1 - [(1 - f) + f*(Ts^4 / T*^4)]) ) = f [1 - (Ts^4 / T*^4)].

Which for f=0.2 and Ts=5000, T*=6000, gives dip≈0.10355, or about 10.35% dip.

Wait, that's a much bigger dip than my initial calculation. So earlier I thought the dip was about 5%, but this way it's about 10%. Which approach is correct?

I think the second approach is correct. Because when the spots are covering a fraction f of the star's surface, each spot emits less flux. So the average flux is (1-f)*1 + f*(Ts^4 / T*^4), all multiplied by the star's luminosity.

So the dip is 1 - that value.

So dip = 1 - [ (1-f) + f*(Ts^4 / T*^4) ) ].

Which is f (1 - (Ts^4/T*^4)).

So in this case, that's 0.2*(1 - (5000/6000)^4) ≈0.2*(1 - 0.48225)=0.2*0.51775≈0.10355 or 10.355%.

So the dip is about 10.35%. That's the amplitude of the brightness variation.

Now, if a planet were to cause the same dip, what radius would it have?

The dip from a planet is (R_p/R*)^2.

So (R_p/R*)^2 = 0.10355.

Taking square root: R_p / R* = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So approximately 0.32 times the star's radius.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which matches this.

So the correct answer should be D) ~0.32.

Wait, but wait. I thought that the dip from the spots was 10.35%, so the planet's radius would have to be about 0.32 R*. But let me make sure.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.10355). Let's calculate it accurately.

0.10355: sqrt(0.1) is 0.3162. 0.10355 is a bit higher.

So let's see: 0.32^2 = 0.1024.

0.32 *0.32=0.1024.

0.321^2 = (0.32 +0.001)^2 = 0.32^2 + 2*(0.32)*(0.001) +0.001²= 0.1024 +0.00064 +0.000001= ~0.103041.

0.321^2=0.103041, which is very close to 0.10355.

So sqrt(0.10355) is approximately 0.3218, so 0.322, which rounds to 0.32. So option D is ~0.32.

So the answer is D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's and an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \). One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of \( f = 0.2 \), and the spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \). The brightness variation caused by the spots is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Dip} = f \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
\]

Substituting \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\text{Dip} = 0.2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right).
\]

First, compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \). Since \( \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.8333 \), we calculate:

\[
\left( 0.8333 \right)^4 \approx 0.48225.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Dip} = 0.2 \left( 1 - 0.48225 \right) = 0.2 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.10355.
\]

The brightness variation caused by the spots is approximately \( 10.355\% \).

If a planet were to cause the same brightness variation, the dip in brightness would be proportional to \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \). Setting this equal to the dip caused by the spots:

\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
\]

Thus, the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \). Comparing this to the options, the closest match is:

**D) ~0.32.**
