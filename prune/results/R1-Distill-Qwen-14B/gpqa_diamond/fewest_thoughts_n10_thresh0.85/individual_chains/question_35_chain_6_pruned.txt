Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me a matrix representation of Ay and asks about its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I need to pick the correct statement from the options A to D.

Wait, the operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So let me write down S first.

So matrix S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Then, Ay = c * S. With c = h/(4π), so Ay becomes:

[ 0*(h/(4π))   (-i)*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))    0 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)     0 ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. In quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of an angular momentum component operator should be related to ħ (h-bar), right? Because angular momentum operators have eigenvalues in units of ħ.

Wait, but in this case, Ay is c times S, so let's find the eigenvalues of S first, then multiply by c.

The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(S - λI) = 0.

So for matrix S:

| -λ       -i     |
| i        -λ     |

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(i) = λ² - (i²). But i² is -1, so λ² - (-1) = λ² + 1. Set to zero: λ² + 1 = 0 → λ² = -1 → λ = ±i.

Wait, so the eigenvalues of S are i and -i. Then, when we multiply by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of Ay are c*i and c*(-i).

Let's compute that. c is h/(4π), so:

Ay eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * i and (h/(4π)) * (-i). So the eigenvalues are ±i h/(4π).

But wait, the options given talk about real and imaginary parts. So let's think about their real and imaginary components.

Eigenvalues are purely imaginary, right. i h/(4π) can be written as 0 + i*(h/(4π)), and the other is 0 - i*(h/(4π)).

So the eigenvalues have zero real part and imaginary parts ± h/(4π).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A says imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be, because from my calculation, the real parts are zero.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. That doesn't fit either because the imaginary part is h/(4π) times i.

Wait, but I'm probably making a mistake here. Let me think again. If S has eigenvalues i and -i, then Ay has c times those. So Ay's eigenvalues are c*i and c*(-i).

Wait, c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * i and -(h/(4π)) * i.

But wait, h is Planck's constant. Oh wait, no, in angular momentum, we usually use ħ = h/(2π). So maybe I can express it in terms of ħ.

Wait, c = h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )? Wait, no. Let me think. ħ is h/(2π), so h = 2π ħ. So c = (2π ħ)/(4π) ) = (2π ħ)/(4 π) )= ħ/2.

So c = ħ/2. Then, the eigenvalues of Ay are (ħ/2) * i and -(ħ/2) * i.

Wait, but that would mean the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So their real parts are zero, and their imaginary parts are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the problem statement says a is the eigenvalue. So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± i ħ/2. So the real part is zero, and the imaginary parts are ± ħ/2.

Hmm, looking back at the options.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh. Wait, 2π times h would be a very large number, but I have h/(4π), so that doesn’t fit.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. No, because our eigenvalues have real part zero and imaginary part ± ħ/2. But what's the value of ħ in terms of h? Oh, right, ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 = h/(4π). So the imaginary parts are ± h/(4π).

So eigenvalues are 0 + i*(h/(4π)) and 0 - i*(h/(4π)).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them mention the real part being zero. Let me check the options again.

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't fit.

Option B: imaginary ±1/2, real ±1. Doesn't fit.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm, that's another possibility. Because in quantum mechanics, different components of angular momentum don't commute, so eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az. But can they be eigenfunctions of A²?

A squared is the square of the angular momentum operator. Since A² commutes with all components of A (because it's the magnitude squared), any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So option C says they can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That sounds correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Not sure. The basis functions are usually the eigenvectors, so perhaps D is correct, but I'm not certain. Let me think. The matrix operator Ay has eigenvectors that form a basis for the space, so any vector can be expressed in terms of them. So D is a correct statement.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, how do the eigenvalues look.

Wait, going back. The eigenvalues are ±i h/(4π). So their real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are ± h/(4π). None of the options directly mention this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the eigenvalues. Let me re-calculate the eigenvalues of S.

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The characteristic equation is determinant of (S - λ I) = 0.

So,

| -λ      -i      |
| i       -λ      | = 0

The determinant is (λ^2) - (-i * i) = λ² - (i*i) → i^2 is -1. So λ² - (-1) → λ² +1 =0 → λ^2 = -1 → λ = ±i. So that's correct.

Therefore, Ay's eigenvalues are c*(±i) = (h/(4π)) * (±i) → ±i h/(4π).

Hmm, so the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So the real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are ± h/(4π).

Looking at the options, none of them directly state that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options are about the eigenvalues of Ay. So the eigenvalues a are ±i h/(4π). So in terms of real and imaginary parts, the real part is zero, and the imaginary part is ± h/(4π). So the imaginary part is ± h/(4π), and the real part is zero.

Looking at the options, none of them directly say that. So perhaps I need to re-examine the options.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh. That would be way larger than h/(4π). So no.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That's not matching.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. Since A^2 commutes with all A components, so that would be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so any vector can be expressed in terms of them. So D could be correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is C or D.

Wait, let's think about the matrix given. It's a 2x2 matrix, which suggests that the spin is 1/2. So the possible eigenvalues for Ay are ± ħ/2 for the Y-component. But wait, in spin systems, the Y-component eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So c is h/(4π), and since ħ = h/(2π), then c is ħ/2. So the eigenvalues of Ay are c * ±i. Wait, that's ±i ħ/2.

Hmm, but that's different from what I thought earlier. Because I thought the eigenvalues are ±i c, but if c is ħ/2, then it's ±i (ħ/2). But in standard quantum mechanics, the Y-component operator (which is S_y) has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Wait, but S_y is given by the matrix S here. So wait, the matrix S is the S_y operator multiplied by something.

Wait, no. The operator Ay is c * S. So if S is S_y, then Ay = c S_y. But S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So then, Ay has eigenvalues c*(± ħ/2 ) = (h/(4π)) * (± ħ/2 ). Wait, but that would be (h/(4π)) * (h/(4π) * (2π/ h )? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think I'm getting myself stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

The operator Ay is given as c * S, where c = h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix.

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute its trace and determinant. The trace is 0 + 0 = 0, and the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - ( - (-1) ) = 0 - 1 = -1.

The characteristic equation is λ² - trace(S) λ + det(S) = λ² - 0 λ + (-1) = λ² - 1 = 0 → λ = ±1. Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation said eigenvalues are i and -i. Oh wait, no, no, wait. The trace is zero, determinant is -1. So the equation is λ² - 0 + (-1) = λ² - 1 = 0 → λ² = 1 → λ = ±1. Wait, wait, that contradicts the earlier calculation.

Wait, no! Because earlier I computed the determinant as (λ² + 1), but that was incorrect. Let me recompute.

When the matrix is S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - [ (-i)(i) ) ].

Compute (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is 0 - (1) = -1.

So the characteristic equation is λ² - trace(S) * λ + det(S) = λ² + (-1) = 0 → λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

Wait, that's different from before. So earlier, I thought the eigenvalues were i and -i, but now I'm getting 1 and -1. Which is correct?

Wait, let me compute the eigenvalues properly.

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The eigenvalues are found by solving (S - λ I ) v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.

So the matrix becomes [[-λ, -i], [i, -λ]].

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i). Which is λ
