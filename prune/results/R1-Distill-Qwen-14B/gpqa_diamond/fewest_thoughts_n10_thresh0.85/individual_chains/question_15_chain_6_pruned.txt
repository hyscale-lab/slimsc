Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe whichever has a higher chance of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, both have the same mass. So their masses are equal. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

The stars they orbit have different masses. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same size. Interesting.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait, no, wait. I think the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on relative to us. But the actual probability is more about the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, no. I think the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough that we see a transit) is calculated as (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, maybe it's (R_star / a) squared? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let
