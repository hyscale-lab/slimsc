Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their masses are negligible, which probably means we can ignore kinetic energy and focus on potential energy. Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question asks for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, okay, so I think I'm being asked about the electric potential energy of the system. Since all the charges are identical and the same sign, they'll repel each other. But since the 13th is fixed at P, the others are at a fixed distance from it. But wait, the 12 charges are at 2 meters from P. So each of those 12 is 2 meters away from P.

Hmm, but how does the potential energy work here? I remember that the electric potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But when you have multiple charges, you have to consider the potential energy between each pair. So the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Wait, but wait—let me think. The system has 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 is 2 meters from the fixed charge. But what about the distance between the 12 moving charges themselves? Are they at a fixed distance from each other? The problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. Hmm, perhaps they're arranged in a spherical shell or something, each at 2m from P. So their mutual distances would vary, but perhaps for the purpose of calculating the minimum potential energy, you can arrange them in a certain configuration that minimizes the energy.

Wait, maybe the question is about the potential energy between each charge and the fixed one, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 moving charges. Because the system's total potential energy includes all the pairwise interactions.

But wait, the problem says it's the minimum energy. So to find the minimum energy, maybe I need to arrange the charges in a way that minimizes the potential energy. Oh, but wait, all the charges are the same positive sign, so they repel each other. The more spread out they are, the lower the potential energy. Or wait, no—since all are positive, the potential energy is positive, so to minimize the total energy, you want to spread them as far apart as possible. But in this setup, the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P. So perhaps their positions relative to each other are such that each is 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances could vary.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only the potential energy between each of the 12
