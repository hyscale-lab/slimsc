Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about three different Michael addition reactions, and I need to find out the major products. There are options provided, so I'll need to figure out each part (A, B, and C) and match them to the options.

First, let me recall what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound (like an enone) by a nucleophile, typically an enolate. The enolate acts as a Lewis base and attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, leading to a conjugate addition. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond.

So, the reactions given are all Michael additions, and I need to determine their products.

Let's tackle each part one by one.

**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ (A)**

Hmm. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's an activated diethyl malonate, which can form an enolate. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw their structures to visualize.

Dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it deprotonates to form a strong nucleophilic enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate).

The acrylate is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, wait. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure should be CH2=C-(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Or wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the double bond?

Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is at the 3 position. So it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached to the carbon adjacent to the double bond. Let me think again.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. The 3 position would be the COOCH3 group, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe the substituent is on the ethenyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)
