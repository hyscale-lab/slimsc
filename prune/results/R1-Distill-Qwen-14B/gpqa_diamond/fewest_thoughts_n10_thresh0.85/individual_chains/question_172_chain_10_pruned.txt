Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me read the question again.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), so I think I can use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, what's the Boltzmann equation again? Oh right, it relates the number of particles in different energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Since the problem mentions the ratio of excitation, I think the ratio of the populations (n_i/n_j) is given as twice for star_1.

Let me denote the two energy levels as i and j, where i is higher in energy. So E_i > E_j, and the energy difference is ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J.

In star_1, n_i/n_j is twice that of star_2. Let's call the ratio for star_1 as 2 * (n_i/n_j)_2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So perhaps the ratio (n_i/n_j) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So (n_i/n_j)_1 = 2*(n_i/n_j)_2.

But what's the ratio (n_i/n_j) for each star? Using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

For star_1: (n_i/n_j)_1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T_1) )

Similarly, for star_2: (n_i/n_j)_2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T_2) )

So the ratio between the two stars is:

(n_i/n_j)_1 / (n_i/n_j)_2 = [ exp(-ΔE/(k T_1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T_2)) ]

Simplify that: exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T_2) - 1/(T_1) ) )

But according to the problem, (n_i
