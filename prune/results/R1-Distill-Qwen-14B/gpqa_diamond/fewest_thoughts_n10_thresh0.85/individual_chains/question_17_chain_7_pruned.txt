Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a calcium-EDTA complex. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says the solution has a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that when they mention a complex like Ca-EDTA, it's a coordination compound where EDTA binds to the calcium ions. EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So each EDTA molecule usually binds to a single Ca²+ ion, forming a complex. 

Wait, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions, I think. Because the solution contains the complex, and I need to find how much free Ca²+ is actually in solution. Oh right, because EDTA forms a very stable complex with Ca²+, so the free ion concentration would be really low.

They also give me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. I think the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction, if I'm not mistaken, would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, the formation constant is when the ions combine to form the complex. So it's K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

So, the formula I need to use is K = [Complex]/([Metal ion][EDTA]). Since the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, that means the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA²-], is 0.02 M, assuming it doesn't dissociate much.

But wait, the complex could dissociate a little. So the dissociation would be: CaEDTA²- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The K for this reaction would be 1/(Kf), right? Because K for the dissociation is the inverse of the formation constant.

So, K_dissociation = 1/Kf =
