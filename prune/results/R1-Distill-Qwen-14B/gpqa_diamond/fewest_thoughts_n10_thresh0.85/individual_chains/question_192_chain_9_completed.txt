Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor has radius R and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Then, someone adds a small positive charge +q inside the cavity.

The question is asking for the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it must be zero. But when you place a charge inside the cavity, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, right. The charge +q inside the cavity will attract negative charges to the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have an induced charge of +q to balance. Because the conductor as a whole must remain neutral.

Now, for the electric field outside the conductor. I'm pretty sure that the electric field outside a charged conductor depends only on the total enclosed charge. That's because the charges inside the conductor (the induced ones) redistribute themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. So for points outside, the conductor's charge behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor is a sphere with a cavity, and the charge is placed off-center. But when considering the external field, does the position of the charge inside the cavity matter? Because for a spherical conductor, any internal charges would be screened, but if the conductor itself has induced charges, perhaps the external field only depends on the total charge of the conductor.

Wait, no. The conductor was initially uncharged, but when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface gets -q, and the outer surface +q. So the total charge on the conductor is +q. So the outer surface's charge is +q, and that's what contributes to the external electric field.

Wait, but the conductor is a spherical shell. So the outer shell's charge +q would produce an electric field outside as if it were a point charge at the center. So regardless of where the charge +q was placed inside the cavity, the external field at point P would be the same as if the charge were at the center of the conductor.

So the electric field at point P should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. Because the external field depends only on the total charge of the conductor, which is +q.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says exactly that: (1/(4πε₀))q/(L²). So that's probably the correct answer.

But wait, let me think again. The charge inside the cavity isn't directly influencing the external field because the conductor's induced charges are what matter. The induced charges on the outer surface sum to +q, and their distribution is uniform because the conductor is a sphere. So the field outside is as if all +q is at the center.

So yes, the external field should only depend on the distance L from the conductor's center. The position of the point P relative to the cavity's center (l and theta) shouldn't affect the external field because the conductor's induced charge distribution ensures that the external field is spherically symmetric.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Conductor Properties**: Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the total charge on it remains zero. However, the charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (to cancel the field inside the conductor) and $+q$ on the outer surface (to maintain charge neutrality).

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a charged spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed by the conductor, regardless of the distribution of the charge inside. For a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface redistribute themselves uniformly due to symmetry.

3. **External Field**: The total charge on the outer surface of the conductor is $+q$, and the electric field outside the conductor is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point $P$ depends only on the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$, and not on the position of the charge inside the cavity or the angle $\theta$.

4. **Analysis of Options**: 
   - Option A and C involve terms like $(l \pm s \cos\theta)^2$, which are irrelevant because the external field does not depend on the position of the charge inside the cavity or the angle $\theta$.
   - Option D uses $l^2$, which is also incorrect because the field depends on $L$, not $l$.
   - Option B correctly gives the electric field as $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$, which matches the expected result based on the external field formula for a spherical charge distribution.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
