Alright, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) has dark spots. The filling factor for these spots is 20%, which I think means they cover 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, we'll see brightness variations as spots come into view and then disappear. These variations can mimic the presence of an exoplanet, and the question is asking what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness change.

So the main goal is to find the exoplanet's radius relative to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar) such that its transit would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on photometric variations caused by starspots and planetary transits. Let me think about each effect.

First, when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness (the dip) depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula for the depth of the transit is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So if the planet is larger relative to the star, the deeper the dip.

Now, for the starspots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler than the rest of the star, so when they rotate into view, the star's overall brightness decreases. But the total effect depends on the area of the spots and how much they dim the star.

The star's brightness is given as Teff = 6000K. The spots are at 5000K (since it's 1000K cooler). The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. Wait, but the hemisphere is half the star. So if the filling factor is 20%, that's 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. But the hemisphere is half the total surface area, so 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2) ?

Wait, no. Let me think. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots. So each hemisphere has 20% spots. Since the star is a sphere, the total surface area is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But wait, no, wait. Filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the observed hemisphere. When the star rotates, we see one hemisphere at a time. So if the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere's surface, then the area of the spots is 0.2 * (π R²).

Wait, let me clarify. Suppose the star's total surface area is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2π R². Filling factor is 20%, so the area of spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4
