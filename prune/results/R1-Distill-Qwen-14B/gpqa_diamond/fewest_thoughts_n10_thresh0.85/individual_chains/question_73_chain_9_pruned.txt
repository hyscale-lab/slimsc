Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical addition; I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh wait, but wait—this is about their relative speed. So, how do I find the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame?

Right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Let me plug the numbers in. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or wait, actually, since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me calculate the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed v_rel is (0.1c)/(0.7) = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c, which matches options C and D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is it (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) when considering one frame relative to another? Yes, because the formula is (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²), where u is the velocity of the other frame. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the velocity of one as seen from the other. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference divided by the denominator factor.

So that gives us about 0.14c, so options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. Now, looking at the options, C says E is 5.96 mc², and D says E is 5 mc².

Next, I need to compute the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy, but wait, wait—no, the total energy of a system is the sum of the relativistic energies of each object. So each astronaut's energy is gamma times m c². Wait, but their masses are 2m and 3m, so their energies are gamma_1 * (2m)c² and gamma_2 * (3m)c² respectively.

So first, compute gamma for each. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For astronaut A: v=0.6c.

Gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: v=0.5c.

Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So his energy is approximately 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding those together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So that's approximately 5.96 mc². Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc².

Wait, but wait: let me make sure I'm adding correctly. 2.5 plus 3.464 is 5.964, which is 5.96 when rounded to two decimal places. So the total energy should be about 5.96 mc². So the correct option would be C, which has both v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

Let me check the options again. Option C is v_rel
