Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm. Let me see. I remember that both these instruments are high-resolution spectrographs, but their brightness limits for observation are different.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So that means V < 17, right? Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. And HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, apparent V magnitude must be less than 16.

But wait, no, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, which means that stars with V brighter (lower number) than 17 can be observed. So the limit is V â‰¤ 17 for ESPRESSO? Or do they mean only up to 17, so V < 17? I think it's that ESPRESSO can handle stars up to, but not exceeding, 17 mag. So if a star's V is 17, ESPRESSO can't observe it, or can it? Hmm, the wording says "brighter than 17", so I think that means less than 17 mag. Because "brighter" in magnitude terms is lower magnitude numbers. So a star with V=16 is brighter than 17. So both spectrographs can observe it. But a star with
