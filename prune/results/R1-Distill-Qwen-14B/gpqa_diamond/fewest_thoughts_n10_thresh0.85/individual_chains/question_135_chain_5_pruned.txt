Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics interactions. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. I remember that in particle physics, the mass of the parent particle determines what it can decay into because of conservation laws and energy requirements.

So, bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because bosons are force carriers, like photons or W bosons, and they can interact with fermions. So X must decay into a pair of fermions. But which ones are possible?

The problem gives four options, each listing possible decay channels. I need to figure out which fermions X can decay into, considering their masses. Oh wait, but wait, the fermion masses matter because the rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of X for the decay to be possible. Oh, right, because the energy available in the center of mass frame must be at least equal to the rest mass of the products.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let me list the rest masses of the known fermions. Let's see:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV
- Up quark (u): around 2 MeV (0.002 GeV)
- Down quark (d): similar, like 3-5 MeV (0.003-0.005 GeV)
- Strange (s): about 100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm (c): around 1.2 GeV
- Bottom (b): about 4.5 GeV
- Top (t): way heavier, like 173 GeV

So X is 6 GeV. For a decay into a pair of fermions, say f and f-bar, the combined rest mass must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. So each fermion's mass is m_f, so 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Let me go through each fermion:

- e: 2*0.0005 = 0.001 GeV, way below 6. So allowed.
- μ: 2*0.1 = 0.2 GeV, allowed.
- τ: 2*1.78=3.56 GeV, which is less than 6. So allowed.
- u: 2*0.002=0.004 GeV, allowed.
- d: similar to u, allowed.
- s: 2*0.1=0.2, allowed.
- c: 2*1.2=2.4 GeV, allowed.
- b: 2*4.5=9 GeV. Oh wait, 9 is way more than 6. So X can't decay into b b-bar, because that would require 9 GeV, but X only has 6. So that's not allowed.

So any decay channel into b quarks
