Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm. Let me read it again.

The question is: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab?

And the options are A to D, with some expressions involving n and v.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. I remember something about the speed of light in a medium and how it's affected when the medium is moving relative to an observer. Oh right, when a medium is moving, the speed of light as observed can change due to the Doppler effect or something related to relative motion.

But wait, the speed of light in a medium is usually c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, in the glass, the speed is 1/n since c is taken as 1 here. But when the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

I'm trying to recall. There's this thing about Galilean relativity and how velocities add. But wait, that's for objects moving at non-relativistic speeds. Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe it's assuming non-relativistic speeds, so using Galilean addition.

So normally, the speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n. But if the glass itself is moving towards the observer at velocity v, how does that affect what the observer measures?

Wait
