Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes. The main one is the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. The pp-I, II, and III branches. I think the pp-III branch is the dominant one, producing a lot of helium-4 and other particles. 

The question says that the pp-III branch stopped hypothetically about 8.5 minutes ago. Oh wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So stopping the pp-III branch would mean that the neutrinos we're detecting now are from before the stoppage, but considering the time delay, we're seeing the effects just now. But how does that affect the neutrino flux we observe now?

Neutrinos are produced in various processes in the Sun. The main ones are from the proton-proton chain, particularly the pp-III branch which I think emits a lot of neutrinos. If pp-III stops, the production of those neutrinos would stop as well. But wait, the question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands. So maybe the neutrinos from the pp-III process have specific energy ranges.

I recall that the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, like those around 1-10 MeV, maybe? But I'm not exactly sure. Oh wait, the neutrinos from the proton-proton chain are lower energy compared to other sources like supernovae. So maybe around a few hundred keV to a few MeV.

The bands given are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So these are high-energy neutrinos. If the pp-III branch is stopped, the production of these neutrinos would decrease, but wait, neutrinos from other sources continue. Or maybe the pp-III is the main source of these neutrinos.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos, but also the other branches might contribute. Or maybe the pp-III is the main process for a certain range of neutrino energies. So if pp-III stops, the flux in a certain band would drop.

But in this
