Okay, so I've got this question here about which molecule has C3H symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is a big deal in chemistry, especially when it comes to understanding properties like chirality and reactivity. But wait, what exactly is C3H symmetry? Oh right, C3H symmetry refers to a molecule having a three-fold rotational axis with a horizontal mirror plane. That means if you rotate the molecule by 120 degrees around this axis, it looks the same. Plus, there's a mirror plane that's horizontal, so the top and bottom would be mirror images.

Looking at the options provided, there are four molecules to consider. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Okay, that's a mouthful. Triphenylene suggests three phenyl groups attached. The rest of the name describes a furan ring system. Wait, furan derivatives can sometimes have symmetry. I'm not sure about this one yet.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Benzo implies a benzene ring fused to the furan parts. Trifuran suggests three furan rings connected. Hexaone means there are six ketone groups. Wait, that seems like a lot. Maybe the symmetry comes from the arrangement of the rings?

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Borate structures have a boron atom in the center. Triisopropyl would mean three isopropyl groups attached. Boron usually has a trigonal planar structure. So three identical groups around it—like isopropyl groups. If all three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically, that could give C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane as well? Since the molecule is flat, maybe. But wait, if the substituents are all the same, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the boron. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact symmetry here.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclic compound. It has a bridge structure, with three rings in a norbornane-like system. I think quinuclidine is a chiral molecule. Wait, because it's chiral, it cannot have a plane of symmetry. So if something is chiral, it lacks a plane or center of symmetry. So if the question is about C3H symmetry, which includes a horizontal mirror plane, D can't be the answer because it's chiral. So D is out.

Now, focusing on the other options. Let's think about triisopropyl borate. Structure-wise, boron is in the center with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a CH(CH3)2 group. So the molecule is symmetric with three identical substituents. The symmetry would be at least C3. But what about the horizontal mirror plane? The borate would lie flat if the substituents are all the same. Wait, no—each isopropyl is a bulky group, but they are all identical. So the molecule might have a mirror plane perpendicular to the boron's plane, but not necessarily a horizontal one. Hmm. Alternatively, if the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would pass through the boron, reflecting the top and bottom. But boron is in the center, so that might not apply. I'm a bit confused here.

Looking at the other options, option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... Wait, the structure would have three fused furan rings, each attached to a benzene ring? Or perhaps it's a system where the benzene is fused to each of the three furan rings. Alternatively, it's a tricyclic system. Maybe the molecule is symmetric with threefold axis. But I'm not sure.

Option A: Triphenyleno... So three phenyl groups attached to a central structure. The core is a trifuran system. If the three phenyl groups are arranged symmetrically around the central furan part, then perhaps it has C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If it's a flat molecule, perhaps.

Wait, C3H symmetry requires a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric in a plane that's horizontal.

Another approach: think of common molecules with C3H symmetry. For instance, molecules like trimethylamine would have C3 symmetry, but they're planar. Wait, but trimethylamine is trigonal pyramidal, so it's not planar. Maybe something like a benzene ring with three substituents equally spaced, each 120 degrees apart. But that's more C3v, maybe.

Wait, what about molecules like 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene? That has a three-fold axis, but it's C3h because of the horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene is symmetric with a three-fold axis, and since it's a planar molecule, it has a horizontal mirror plane (the plane of the ring itself). So that would have C3h symmetry.

So looking at the options, which one has three substituents arranged symmetrically in a plane with a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror?

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran... Wait, the name suggests three phenyl groups attached. If the core is a furan ring system, perhaps they're arranged around it.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the options.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Wait, the numbering might suggest that there are three ketones (hexaone) in specific positions, but maybe the arrangement of the rings gives it symmetry.

Alternatively, triphenyleno[...]trifuran in option A is probably a more complex system with three phenyl groups attached to a central trifuran structure. If the phenyl groups are attached at 120-degree angles, that might give the three-fold rotation. Plus, if the molecule is planar, the horizontal mirror plane would be present.

Alternatively, triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical substituents around the boron. If the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane could exist. But wait, the isopropyl groups are in a trigonal planar arrangement. So, if the molecule lies flat, then a horizontal mirror plane would be possible, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but for C3h symmetry, the molecule must have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror. So, like in 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, which is C3h.

So, let's think about each option again.

Option D is out because it's chiral.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. B is in the center, with three isopropyl groups. Let me think about the structure. Each isopropyl is CH(CH3)2. So, the molecule is trigonal planar around B. If all three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, then the molecule has a three-fold axis. But what about the mirror plane? In the trigonal planar structure, the molecule lies flat. So a horizontal mirror plane would run through the B atom, mirroring the top and bottom. Wait, no, because the isopropyl groups are all in the same plane. Actually, isopropyl groups are not flat. Wait, no, each isopropyl group is a CH(CH3)2 which is a substituent with two methyl groups attached to a CH2 group. Wait, no, isopropyl is (CH3)2CH–, which is a substituent that is not flat. Hmm, maybe the molecule isn't flat. So the symmetry might not have a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric in a different way. So maybe triisopropyl borate has C3 symmetry but without the horizontal mirror plane, making it C3 instead of C3h.

Hmm, so perhaps I should look for the option that is a planar molecule with three substituents arranged symmetrically.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. The structure's rings would determine symmetry. If the rings are arranged such that a three-fold rotation leaves the molecule invariant, and a horizontal mirror plane exists, then it would have C3h.

Alternatively, option A: Triphenyleno[...]trifuran. The three phenyl groups could be attached symmetrically. If the central core is a flat structure, and the phenyl groups are attached at 120 degrees, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of each molecule's structure. Maybe I should think about the options given the answer choices.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is supposed to be one of them. Let's think about common compounds with C3h symmetry.

Wait, I remember that trioxane derivatives, like 1,3,5-trioxane, have C3h symmetry. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, another thought: quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic amine. Its structure is such that it's not planar, so it can't have a horizontal mirror plane. Also, since it's chiral, it can't have any plane of symmetry. So D is definitely not the answer.

So, the possible options are A, B, or C.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. If the molecule is symmetric with three identical substituents around B, then it would have a three-fold axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar geometry, then the mirror plane would be perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. Wait, no, maybe the mirror plane is the same as the plane the molecule lies in. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the correct molecule is triphenyleno[...]trifuran (option A). If the three phenyl groups are attached symmetrically, then C3h symmetry would be present.

Wait, let me think about the nomenclature. The name benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran suggests that each benzene ring is fused to the furan rings at specific positions. So maybe the structure is such that each benzene is attached in a way that the molecule has three-fold symmetry.

Alternatively, the structure of triphenyleno[...]trifuran (option A) could have three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically around the central furan system, leading to C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should think about the number of substituents and their arrangement.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone has six ketone groups. That's a lot. Maybe the arrangement of the ketones contributes to symmetry.

Alternatively, option C: triisopropyl borate. Let's consider the molecular geometry. Boron has a trigonal planar geometry. If all three substituents (isopropyl groups) are the same, then the molecule has C3 symmetry. But to have C3h, there must be a horizontal mirror plane. If the molecule is symmetric through the plane of the boron, then perhaps it would have a horizontal mirror. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the C3h point group includes a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So for a molecule to have this symmetry, it must belong to the C3h point group.

Looking for molecules with C3h symmetry, they often have a trigonal structure with a horizontal mirror. For example, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene is C3h because it's planar and has three identical substituents at 120-degree intervals.

So, in our options, which one is like that?

Option A: Triphenyleno[...]trifuran. If the three phenyl groups are in a trigonal arrangement around the central structure, and the molecule is flat, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, option B's structure is a tricyclic system with benzene rings attached. Maybe it's symmetric in a different way.

Wait, the correct answer is C) triisopropyl borate. Why? Because the three isopropyl groups are identical, arranged around boron, which is in the center. So the molecule is symmetric with a three-fold axis, and if it's planar, it has a horizontal mirror. But I'm not sure about the planarity. Alternatively, the molecule being trigonal planar would have a mirror plane perpendicular to the plane, which would be a vertical mirror, not horizontal.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think again. The C3h symmetry requires a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. A horizontal mirror plane would cut the molecule into top and bottom mirror images.

If a molecule is flat (planar), then a horizontal mirror would be the same as the plane of the molecule.

So, triphenylene would have three phenyl groups attached to a central benzene ring. Wait, but that's a different structure. No, triphenylene is three phenyl rings fused together in a symmetric fashion. Wait, that's actually a structure with six rings arranged in a trigonal symmetric way. Hmm.

Alternatively, option A's structure is a triphenylene group attached to a trifuran. So the three phenyl groups are in a symmetric arrangement, perhaps leading to C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. The structure is [B(CH(CH3)2)3]. Boron has a trigonal planar structure, so the three substituents are arranged in a plane. So, the molecule is flat. So, a horizontal mirror plane would be the same as the plane of the molecule. So, if the molecule is flat, then it has a horizontal mirror plane. And it's symmetric with three identical groups, so a three-fold axis. So that would fit C3h symmetry.

So, if triisopropyl borate is planar, it would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but is triisopropyl borate planar? I think the boron is sp2 hybridized, so trigonal planar, which is planar. So yes, the molecule is flat, and all three substituents are the same. Thus, it has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h.

So, option C would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but earlier I thought about option D being chiral and thus not having any mirror plane. So option D is out.

So the correct answer would be option C: triisopropyl borate.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is in the list. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran

B) benzo[...]trifuran

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, based on this, the answer should be option C.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I'm not a hundred percent sure. Another thought: sometimes, the symmetry can be more complex. For example, if a molecule has a three-fold axis but lacks a mirror plane, then it would be C3, not C3h.

In the case of triisopropyl borate, since it's planar, it has a mirror plane. But is that mirror plane horizontal?

Wait, if the molecule is flat (planar), then any mirror plane that is perpendicular to the plane would be vertical, and the horizontal mirror would be the same as the plane itself. Wait, no, the horizontal plane is the same as the plane of the molecule.

So, the molecule lies in the horizontal plane, and the mirror plane is the same as the plane of the molecule. So, a horizontal mirror plane would cause the top and bottom to be mirrored. But if the molecule is flat, there's no top and bottom—it's all in the same plane. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Maybe the "horizontal" in C3h refers to the relative orientation. So, if you imagine a plane cutting horizontally through the molecule, like slicing through the middle, then the parts above and below are mirror images.

Wait, but in a planar molecule, like benzene, the plane of the molecule itself is a mirror plane. So, any mirror plane would be perpendicular to the molecular plane. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of a molecule with C3h symmetry. For example, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) has three methyl groups at 120-degree intervals on a benzene ring. This molecule is planar, so a horizontal mirror plane would be the same as the benzene ring's plane. Additionally, a three-fold rotation axis exists. So, yes, it has C3h symmetry.

Similarly, triisopropyl borate would have three identical substituents in a trigonal planar arrangement. It's flat, so a horizontal mirror plane exists. Thus, it should have C3h symmetry.

So, option C is triisopropyl borate, which has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but another thought: the isopropyl groups are not flat. Each is a CH(CH3)2 group, which is a three-dimensional substituent. So, the molecule as a whole isn't flat. Therefore, the mirror plane isn't in the same way as the benzene ring. So, is the molecule non-planar?

Hmm, that complicates things. Because if the molecule is non-planar, then the horizontal mirror plane may not exist in the same way.

Wait, but the boron atom is in a trigonal planar geometry, so the three substituents are in a plane. So, the overall molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the boron atom, making the molecule planar. But wait, is that the case? Each isopropyl group is a three-dimensional substituent, but the central boron and the three substituents are in a plane, so the molecule is flat.

Wait, no. Each isopropyl group is a substituent that is itself three-dimensional. So, the entire molecule might have a certain symmetry, but perhaps not a horizontal mirror plane. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because the name suggests a triphenylene group, which is known to have a three-fold symmetry.

Wait, triphenylene is a tricyclic aromatic compound with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way. It has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, it would have C3h symmetry.

So, option A is triphenyleno[...]trifuran. That suggests a triphenylene group attached to a trifuran. But the presence of the trifuran might disrupt the symmetry. Alternatively, if the phenyl groups are arranged symmetrically, the overall structure could still have C3h symmetry.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to look up the structures.

Wait, without looking, I have to think based on the names.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

The "benzo" part implies that each furan ring is fused with a benzene ring. The numbering suggests that each benzene is attached in a way that may create a symmetric structure.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. The "triphenylene" part is a symmetric arrangement of three benzene rings, so when attached to a trifuran, the symmetry might be maintained.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but I'm supposed to choose between these. Another angle: the problem asks for C3h symmetry. Which of these structures is known for that?

I think that triphenylene itself has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h. So, if the trifuran is attached in a way that doesn't disrupt that symmetry, option A would have C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But I'm getting really stuck here. Maybe I should think about the number of substituents and their positions.

Wait, the molecule with C3h symmetry must have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So, the key is to find a molecule with three identical substituents arranged symmetrically in a planar structure.

Looking again, triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical substituents and is trigonal planar. So, yes, it has C3 symmetry. But does it also have a horizontal mirror?

Yes, if the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane exists, making it C3h.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the planarity. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the correct answer is option A. Because tricyclic systems with three identical substituents arranged symmetrically around the central structure often have C3h symmetry.

So, perhaps:

Option A: Triphenyleno[...]trifuran has three phenyl groups symmetrically placed, leading to C3h.

Alternatively, option C: triisopropyl borate is flat and symmetric, leading to C3h.

I'm torn between C and A.

Wait, I think if the molecule is planar, it's more likely to have a horizontal mirror plane. Triisopropyl borate is flat, as the boron and substituents are in a plane. So, it's planar, has a three-fold axis, and a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it has C3h symmetry.

So, the answer should be option C: triisopropyl borate.


To determine which molecule has **C₃H symmetry**, we analyze the options based on the definition of **C₃H symmetry**: a three-fold rotational axis (120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged) and a horizontal mirror plane (the molecule is symmetric when reflected across a plane parallel to the molecular plane).

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule contains a triphenylene group, which is a symmetric arrangement of three phenyl groups fused in a trigonal planar fashion. The trifuran core is likely arranged such that the three phenyl groups are symmetrically positioned. If the molecule is planar and the phenyl groups are equally spaced, it would have a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it **C₃H symmetric**. However, the exact structure of the trifuran system could potentially disrupt the symmetry, leaving some uncertainty.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule has a benzo-fused trifuran system with six ketone groups. The arrangement of the benzene rings and the ketones may introduce symmetry, but the presence of six substituents complicates the symmetry. It is unlikely to have a three-fold rotational axis or a horizontal mirror plane, as the substituents are not identical or symmetrically arranged in a way that satisfies **C₃H symmetry**.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
This molecule has a boron atom at the center with three identical isopropyl groups arranged in a trigonal planar geometry. Boron is sp² hybridized, making the molecule planar. The three-fold rotational axis is present due to the identical substituents, and the horizontal mirror plane exists as the molecule lies in a single plane. Thus, triisopropyl borate satisfies the criteria for **C₃H symmetry**.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. It is chiral, meaning it lacks any plane of symmetry, including a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it cannot have **C₃H symmetry**.

### Conclusion  
Option A is a strong candidate due to the symmetric arrangement of the triphenylene group, but the trifuran system may disrupt the symmetry. Option C, triisopropyl borate, is planar, has a three-fold rotational axis, and a horizontal mirror plane, making it **C₃H symmetric**. Based on the analysis, the most definitive answer is **C**.

**Answer: C**
