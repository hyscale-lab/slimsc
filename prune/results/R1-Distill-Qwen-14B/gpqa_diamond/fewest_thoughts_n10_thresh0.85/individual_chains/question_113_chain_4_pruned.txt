Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. The compound is an unknown, and they've used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to characterize it. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of either O-H (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or N-H (but I don't think that's the case here since the options don't have N). But wait, the peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are strong absorptions. I remember that carbonyl groups (C=O) usually absorb around 1700 cm⁻¹. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic ketone or perhaps an ester or something else.

So, maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or one with another functional group. Wait, two strong peaks at those wavenumbers. So perhaps one is a ketone (around 1700) and the other could be an ester or another carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl, and the other is something else. Wait, 1650 is a bit lower than a typical ketone, which is around 1700. Maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, such as an aromatic carbonyl group.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are typically the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond. That might tie into the IR absorption. Wait, the IR at 1650 could also be a C=C stretch. So perhaps it's an alkene, which would have a peak in that region. But wait, the 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that's consistent.

Now, the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass for certain functional groups. For example, the CH3O group (though that's 31), or maybe CO (28), but wait, 45 is something else. Oh, wait, 45 could be (CH2O) or something else. Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion, but I'm not sure. Let me think about possible fragments. The m/z=45 is a key clue.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible formulas could be something like an ester, maybe with an alcohol and an acid part. Or a ketone and something else.

Option B: C6H10O. This would be a less oxygenated compound. Maybe an alkene with an alcohol group.

Option C: C6H10O2. Maybe a di-ester or a compound with two oxygen-containing groups like a ketone and an ester.

Option D: C6H12O. Perhaps a monocyclic ether or an alcohol with a double bond.

Let me think about the FTIR again. The very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. That's a strong O-H stretch, broad, which suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually very broad and around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, which fits. But also, a ketone at 1700, and maybe an ester or another carbonyl.

Wait, but if the compound has an acid group, the formula would have two oxygen atoms? For a carboxylic acid, it's RCOOH, which is RCO2H. So for each carboxylic acid, you have two O in the formula (since formula is CnH2nO2). Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2, which fits a dicarboxylic acid, but wait, I don't know if the NMR would have vinyl hydrogens.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester. Esters have a carbonyl group and an ether-like linkage. So the IR would show a strong peak around 1700 (ester C=O) and another peak possibly from the ester's oxygen, but maybe something else.

Wait, the two peaks in IR are at 1700 and 1650. Could one be an ester and the other a conjugated double bond? Or perhaps a ketone and an ester.

Wait, another thought: the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, so maybe an alkene. If there's a conjugated carbonyl group, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, that would explain the IR peak at 1650. So the structure could have a C=C and a C=O conjugated, which would lower the wavenumber of the carbonyl. In that case, the 1700 might be an ester or another carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's look at the mass spec. So the fragment at m/z=45. What possible fragments could give that? Let's think about possible structures.

For example, in an ester like ethyl acetate, the fragments might include the ester group breaking off. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which is possible for an ester like methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the molecular formula for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2=(14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. Degree of unsaturation: (14-10)/2=2. So two rings, or a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation: (14-10 -0)/2=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O. Degree of unsaturation: (14-12)/2=1. So same as option A.

So the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, so the compound has at least one double bond. So the degrees of unsaturation must include that.

Looking back, the FTIR shows a broad peak around 3000, which is likely an O-H group. Now, if the compound has an O-H and a carbonyl, that would fit an ester or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but a carboxylic acid has a broad O-H, and a strong carbonyl peak. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would have two oxygens (like option C or A). Wait, let me check the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. That would be something like a carboxylic acid with a single ring or a double bond. The molecular formula for a monocarboxylic acid is CnH2nO2. So for n=6, it's C6H12O2. So option A is a possible formula for a carboxylic acid.

Option C: C6H10O2. That would imply two degrees of unsaturation. So it could be a ring plus a double bond, or two rings, or two double bonds. But if it's a diacid, like HOOC-(something)-COOH, but that would require more carbons, perhaps.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, the formula would be R-O-CO-R'. Let's see the molecular formulas. For example, if it's methyl something, maybe the formula would fit.

But let me think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z=45. Let's see what 45 corresponds to. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O (which is 31), but wait, 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O, but that's not an exact fit. Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion (CH2O), which is 44, but that's not 45.

Wait, 45 could be (CH2O) plus something. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from a carbonyl group. For instance, a methyl group attached to a carbonyl might break off, but not sure.

Another approach: let's think about possible compounds that match the given data.

The IR has a broad peak (O-H) and two carbonyls, but wait, no—maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Wait, maybe the 1650 cm⁻¹ is a conjugated double bond (C=C) stretch, not a carbonyl. Vinyl protons are in the NMR, so that fits.

So the IR would have a strong O-H (broad) and a carbonyl (around 1700). So perhaps the compound has a carbonyl group and an alcohol group. So the formula would have at least two oxygen atoms. Looking at the options, options A and C have two oxygens.

So possible structures: an aliphatic ketone with an alcohol group, or an ester with an alcohol, or maybe a carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So the structure has both a carbonyl and a double bond.

Wait, another thought: the IR at 1700 is a carbonyl, 1650 could be a conjugated double bond. So the compound could have both a carbonyl and a double bond, perhaps in conjugation. That would explain both peaks.

If the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, the carbonyl would be conjugated with a double bond, so its stretching frequency would be lower than a regular ketone, which is around 1700. So that would fit the 1650 cm⁻¹. But then the 1700 would be from another carbonyl group, perhaps an ester or another ketone.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a conjugated double bond nearby. The ester carbonyl would be around 1700, and the C=C would be around 1650.

So putting this together, the structure could be an ester with a conjugated double bond, or a ketone with a conjugated double bond. Either way, the formula would have two oxygen atoms (from the ester or ketone and the alcohol group).

Wait, but the FTIR also shows a broad peak around 3000, which suggests an O-H group. So if it's an ester, the O-H would come from an alcohol group, perhaps.

Wait, but esters are formed from an acid and an alcohol. The ester itself doesn't have an O-H group unless it's a hemiacetal or something, which it's not. So wait, if the compound has both an ester group (so O from the ester) and an alcohol group (O-H), then the formula would have two O's. So the formula would be something like R-O-CO-R' with an -OH group elsewhere.

But that would make the formula have three O's. Wait, no, the ester is O from the ester linkage. Let me think. An ester is RCOOR', which has two oxygen atoms in the ester group. So if the compound is an ester and has an -OH group, that would make three oxygens. But looking at the options, none have three oxygens. So that can't be.

Wait, alternative possibilities. If the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, but that would have two oxygens in the formula (since a carboxylic acid is RCOOH, which is O2). So the formula would have two oxygens, which matches options A and C.

So if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, then the formula would be C6H12O2 (option A) because a monocarboxylic acid is RCOOH, formula CnH2nO2. For n=6, H would be 12. So yes, that matches option A.

But wait, then the IR would show a strong O-H (broad) and a carbonyl (around 1700). The presence of a double bond would explain the vinyl protons in the NMR, but where's the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak? If the structure is a carboxylic acid with a conjugated double bond, the C=O would be around 1700, and the C=C could be around 1650. So that fits.

But wait, another possibility: if the compound is an ester with an alcohol group, but that would require three oxygens, which none of the options have. So that's out.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. So formula would be C6H12O2 (option A). The IR would show O-H (broad) and C=O (1700). The presence of a double bond (vinyl H) would add to the structure, so the degree of unsaturation would be 2 (one from the ketone, another from the double bond). Let me check the degrees of unsaturation for option A: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. Oh, wait, that would mean only one degree of unsaturation. So that's a problem because if there's a double bond and a ketone, that's two degrees. So that can't be.

Wait, so option A has only one degree of unsaturation. So if the structure has a double bond and a ketone, that would require two degrees, which would mean option A is not possible. Hmm, that's a problem.

Let me recalculate the degrees of unsaturation for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2 → 2C +2 - H - X + N)/2 → (12 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2= (2)/2=1. So one degree: either a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O → (12 +2 -10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2 → (14 -10)/2=2. Two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O → (14-12)/2=1. One degree.

So if the structure has both a double bond and a carbonyl group (two degrees), then the formula must have two degrees. So options B, C, and D have 2, 2, and 1, respectively. So option A (1) is out because it can't have two degrees. So the correct formula must be either B, C, or D.

Wait, but I was thinking the compound has a carbonyl and a double bond, which are two degrees, so the formula must have two degrees. So options B and C have two degrees. So options A and D are out.

So now the options are B and C.

Option B: C6H10O. So one O. If the compound has a double bond and a carbonyl, that would need two O's. So that's impossible for option B, which only has one O. So option B is out.

Thus, the only possible options are C and D. Wait, no, option D has one degree, so if the structure has two degrees, then option D is out.

So the only possible option is C: C6H10O2, which has two degrees of unsaturation. So this would fit a structure with a double bond and a carbonyl group, or two rings, etc.

So back to the IR. The two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. If there are two carbonyl groups, but that would require two O's. Alternatively, one carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. So for option C, which has two O's, perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond, or a ketone with a double bond.

But wait, the FTIR's broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests an O-H group. So with option C (C6H10O2), which has two O's, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Wait, but a carboxylic acid has the formula RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2. So for n=6, it's C6H12O2, which is option A, not C. So option C is C6H10O2, which is two less hydrogens. That would imply a double bond and/or a ring.

So for a compound with formula C6H10O2: The structure could be a cyclic ester (a lactone), which would have a ring (one degree) and a carbonyl (another degree, from the ester group). Alternatively, it could be a substituted benzene ring with an ester group, which would account for the two degrees.

Wait, but the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, not a ring. So maybe the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So the ester's carbonyl would be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond would be around 1650.

So in that case, the FTIR would show peaks at 1700 and 1650. The broad peak at 3000 would come from an O-H group. Wait, but if it's an ester, it doesn't have an O-H. So perhaps the O-H is from another group like an alcohol. Wait, but then the formula would have three O's, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a phenol group. But then the formula would have two O's. So a phenol group (O-H) and an ester group (another O). So that could fit.

Wait, but phenol's O is part of the aromatic ring, so the formula would have two O's. Let's see, if the structure is an aromatic ring with an ester group, like a phenyl ester. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a dienol ester or something with conjugated double bonds.

Alternatively, the compound could be a cyclohexenone derivative with an ester group, but that's getting into specific structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters have two carbonyl groups: one ketone and one ester. So their IR would show two strong absorption bands: one for the ketone (around 1700) and one for the ester (also around 1700, but maybe a bit lower). Wait, but in the IR data, the two peaks are at 1700 and 1650. So perhaps one is a ketone and the other a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but then the O-H would be in another group. So if the structure is a beta-keto ester with an alcohol group, that would require three O's, which isn't the case. So that can't be.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z=45. What could that be?

45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO+? No, that's 58. Wait, 45 is the same as CH3COO- (which is 60 if it's CH3COOH). Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from a larger molecule.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the compound would be one of the options. Let's calculate the molecular weight of each option.

Option A: C6H12O2 → (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) =72+12+32=116 g/mol.

Option B: C6H10O →72 +10 +16=98 g/mol.

Option C: C6H10O2 →72 +10 +32=114 g/mol.

Option D: C6H12O →72 +12 +16=100 g/mol.

The mass spectrum shows a peak at m/z=45. So the fragment is likely a small part of the molecule. Let's see which of these could break into a 45 fragment.

Looking for a fragment with a molecular weight of 45. Let's see:

45 could be C3H7O (which is 3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=60? Wait no, 3*12=36, 7*1=7, and O=16. 36+7=43 +16=59. So that's not right.

Hmm, 45 could be (CH2)2CO, which is 45? Let me calculate: C=12, H=2, so (CH2)2 is (28) plus CO (28?), wait no. Alternatively, maybe (CH3)2O is 31, which is lower than 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is CH2=CH-O-CO- something. No, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about common fragments. The tropylium ion (C7H7+) is around m/z=91. Not helpful here.

Wait, another idea: the fragment at m/z=45 could be a ketene ion, which has the formula (CH2)2O, but that's 44. Or maybe a vinyl group with some oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is an ethylene oxide or something similar, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible structures for each option and see which would produce a 45 fragment.

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's imagine the structure is an ester with a double bond. For instance, something like CH2=CHCOO-R. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester with a double bond.

When such a molecule breaks apart, perhaps a fragment like (CH2)2CO (which is 45: 24+2+16=42? No, wait. CH2=CHCOO- would be a larger fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule loses a larger group, leaving a smaller fragment. For instance, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2O..., but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: looking for the molecular formula that includes a fragment of 45. Let's see for each option.

Option C is C6H10O2. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 and a fragment is 45 (which is (C3H7O), but that's 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16 → 36+7+16=59. No. Alternatively, maybe (CH2O) is 30. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an acylium ion. For example, CH2=CHCO+ would have a molecular weight of 56 (12*3 + 2 + 16*1=36+2+16=54? Not 45. Alternatively, maybe (CH2)2O is 44. Close but not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. For example, if the molecule is an ester, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketone. For example, (CH
