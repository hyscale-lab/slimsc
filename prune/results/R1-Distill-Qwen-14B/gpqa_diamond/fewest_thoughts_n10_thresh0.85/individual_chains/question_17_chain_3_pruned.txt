Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and they're giving me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The pH is ideal, which I think means that the pH doesn't affect the EDTA much, so I don't have to worry about protonation or anything like that.

Hmm, okay, so first, what do I remember about EDTA and its complexes? EDTA, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions, like Ca²+, in a 1:1 ratio. So when it's complexed with Ca²+, the formula would be something like CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant, K, for a complex tells us how strong the complex is. The larger the K, the more stable the complex. K is given here as 5x10^10, which is a big number, so the complex is very stable.

So the problem is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Since the EDTA is so strong, not much free Ca²+ should be left. Because the complex is stable, almost all the Ca²+ would be tied up in the complex.

Wait, but how do I calculate the free ion concentration? I think I need to use the formation constant expression. The formation constant K is defined as [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, so [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But wait, what about the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-? Are they equal?

Let me think. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which means that initially, before any dissociation, all the Ca and EDTA are in the complex. But some small amount might dissociate, giving a tiny amount of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. Since K is so large, the dissociation is minimal, so [Ca²+] would be very low.

Let me set up the variables. Let me denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Then, since each CaEDTA complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of free EDTA would also be x. 

So the formation constant expression is:

K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

Plugging in the known values:

5x10^10 = 0.02 / (x * x)

So,

x² = 0.02 / (5e10)

Wait, wait. Let me write that correctly. Rearranging:

x² = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] = (0.02) / (5e10)

Wait, no. Because K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). So if [CaEDTA] is 0.02, then:

5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2), because [Ca] and [EDTA] are both x.

So,

x² = 0.02 / 5e10

Calculating that: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, wait
