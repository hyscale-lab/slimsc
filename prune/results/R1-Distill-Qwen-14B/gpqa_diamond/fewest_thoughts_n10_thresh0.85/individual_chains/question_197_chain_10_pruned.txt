Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, okay.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which probably indicates an O-H stretch. Wait, but that's a broad region. Oh, right, that's the range where O-H (like in carboxylic acids or alcohols) or maybe an amine (N-H) would show up. But in this case, the other peaks might help. There's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's in the range for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Also, the peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 suggest aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm, which is really high. That must be an aldehyde proton, but wait, wait. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton is around 10-12 ppm. But carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak, and that's what the question says—bs for broad singlet. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. So, the 10.5 ppm peak is likely the -COOH proton.

The next peak is at 8.0 ppm, a doublet (d) integrating for 2H. Aromatic protons. Also at 7.2 ppm, another doublet for 2H. So that looks like a para-substituted benzene. Because the two doublets probably correspond to the protons adjacent to substituents in the para positions. So, maybe it's a 4-substituted benzene, like para-substituted.

Then, at 2.9 ppm, a multiplet integrating 1H. That could be a CH group next to something, maybe a carbonyl. Like in a ketone or an ester? Or perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom. Hmm.

At 1.7 ppm, a multiplet for 2H. Maybe a CH2 group next to another group. Then, 1.4 ppm is a triplet (d) for 3H. Wait, a triplet with 3H—could that be a methyl group attached to something else, like a CH2 or another CH3. And finally, 0.9 ppm is a triplet for 3H, probably a terminal CH3, like in an ethyl group.

Putting this together, maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Considering the para substitution on the benzene, the structure might be something like a benzene ring with a substituent at the para position. Let me think about the substituent.

The substituent would have the parts from the NMR. The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) and 1.7 ppm (2H, m), plus the 1.4 (3H, d) and 0.9 (3H, t) suggests a chain. Like perhaps a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group or something. Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached in a certain way.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a triplet? No, the question says 1.4 is a doublet. Oh no, wait, the question says 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), so that's a doublet—so maybe it's a CH2CH(CH3) group. Because, for example, if we have a CH(CH2CH3) group, the methyl (CH3) would be attached to a CH, which is split into a doublet if coupled to another CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a tert-butyl group, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, the groups could be part of a longer chain. Maybe a butyl group. Let me think: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to the carbonyl. So, maybe the structure is something like:

Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- ?

Wait, but let's re-examine the NMR data. The 10.5 ppm is the -COOH proton. Then, the aromatic protons are two doublets, which implies para substitution. So, the substituent is attached at the para position of the benzene ring.

So if the substituent is a -COOH group, but wait, the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would have a broad peak around 2500-3000 as well. Oh wait, the IR given is 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak. So that's consistent with a carboxylic acid O-H stretch.

So, the substituent is a -COOH group attached to the benzene ring. Then, what is the rest of the structure?

Looking at the NMR, after the aromatic protons, the 2.9 ppm could be a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl, like in a -CH2- group. Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the COOH
