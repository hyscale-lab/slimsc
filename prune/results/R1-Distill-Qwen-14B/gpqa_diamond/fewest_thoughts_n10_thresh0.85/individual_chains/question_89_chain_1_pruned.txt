Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. It's a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step. 

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me think about each step and what's happening.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they usually undergo an elimination reaction, specifically an E2 mechanism, which forms an alkene. So, the product here should be a diene, maybe 1,3-adamantadiene? Or wait, since it's 1,3-dibromo, upon elimination, it could form 1,3-adamantadiene with a double bond between carbons 1 and 3? Hmm, but wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the positions might rearrange. Alternatively, maybe it forms 1,3-adamantadiene with two double bonds? No, wait, each bromine is on adjacent carbons, so when each leaves, we get a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? Wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single elimination, but wait, there are two bromines, so maybe two eliminations happen? Or perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide elimination, which gives a single double bond.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on C1 and C3. When KOH is added, each Br can leave. Wait, but E2 would require anti-periplanar arrangement. So, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, maybe the elimination forms a double bond between C1 and C2, as well as C3 and C4? But that would require each Br leaving, maybe as a di-elimination, forming a conjugated diene. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene, which is a conjugated diene in the adamantane structure. 

The product 1 is a light yellow solid, which makes sense for an alkene as they are often less polar and can have colors due to conjugation. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, IR peaks around 1700-1750 usually indicate carbonyl groups. But the product from KOH elimination should be an alkene, not a ketone or ester. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But KOH is a strong base, more likely to cause elimination. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. Wait, in some cases, when two halides are present, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. Wait, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide elimination, forming a double bond. So, product 1 would be 1,3-diene. But then the IR would have a peak around 1650 for C=C. But the IR given is at 1720, which points to a carbonyl group. Hmm. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, could it be an epoxide? No, because that would require an oxygen nucleophile. Wait, but KOH is strong base, maybe it's an E2 elimination, but perhaps the product is a cycloalkane with a carbonyl? Or is there another possibility.

Wait, another thought: maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH in a SN2 reaction. But with two Br atoms, perhaps each is replaced by an -OH group. So, the product would be 1,3-diol, but that doesn't fit the IR peak. 1,3-diol would have OH stretches around 3200-3500 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned. Alternatively, maybe elimination to form ketone? Wait, but how? 

Wait, perhaps elimination occurs but with the formation of a ketone. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, another possibility: maybe the dihalide undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but in this case, the IR peak is 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests maybe a ketone elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an enol. Enols have a conjugated C=O and C=C. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ fits a carbonyl, and the NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a quartet in 1H NMR? Wait, the NMR data is as follows: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). 

The 4.79 ppm is probably an -OH proton, but wait, in D2O, OH protons would exchange and not appear. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ether or a methylene adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, 4.79 (2H) could be an OCH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide. Wait, but then the coupling would be different.

Wait, if product 1 is an epoxide, what would its NMR look like? Epoxide protons typically resonate around 3.5-4.5 ppm as a triplet or a quartet, depending on neighboring protons. But the 4.79 ppm is a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group adjacent to some protons.

Wait, let's think again. What's the structure after heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Another possibility: Maybe it's a double elimination, but perhaps the product is a diene. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the product is not an alkene but a ketone. But how? Because 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. Unless there's some rearrangement. Wait, but without a good leaving group, how would a ketone form? Hmm. 

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the initial reaction is a vicinal dihalide elimination, forming a double bond, and then that's product 1. But then the IR should show a peak for C=C around 1650 cm⁻¹. But the given IR is 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone created via some rearrangement. But that seems unlikely under KOH conditions. 

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product is a diketone. But how would that form from a dihalide? Oh wait, maybe it's through a nucleophilic attack. For example, if each Br is replaced by an OH group (substitution), but then the structure would have two OH groups. But then, under certain conditions, perhaps elimination would form a ketone. That seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or some similar process, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But then, how would that form from a dihalide with KOH? Epoxides are usually formed from alkenes via epoxidation with peracids. Alternatively, if KOH is used in some way, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the IR. The 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone. How could that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Wait, perhaps the dihalide undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but elimination from a dihalide usually forms an alkene, unless it's a geminal dihalide, which can form
