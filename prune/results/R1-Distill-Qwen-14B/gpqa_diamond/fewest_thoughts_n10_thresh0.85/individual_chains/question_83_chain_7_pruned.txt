Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm. Let me break this down into parts. First, I think I should figure out what's happening when we dilute the acetic acid. Then, during titration, I need to consider the points at 25% and equivalence.

So, the first step is diluting the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20 cm³ and concentration is 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. I remember that concentration changes when you dilute a solution. The formula is M1V1 = M2V2.

Calculating the diluted concentration: M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) / 40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, wait: 0.05 * 20 is 1 mmol, but wait, no, wait. Let me do it properly. 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/dm³. 20 cm³ is 0.02 dm³. So moles of acetic acid initially are 0.05 mol/dm³ * 0.02 dm³ = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 dm³) of water, total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 dm³). So the new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 dm³ = 0.025 M. So yes, 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will be equal to moles of acetic acid initially.

Wait, but the solution has been diluted, so the moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol (as calculated before). The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. Let's find the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence.

Moles NaOH = 0.001 mol. Volume NaOH = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 dm³, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about the pH at 25% titration. So, 25% of the equivalence point volume. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the titration is done by adding NaOH to the diluted acetic acid solution. So, the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. So, moles of acetic acid is 0.04 L * 0.025 M? Wait, no. Wait, 40 cm³ is 0.04 dm³, right? So 0.04 * 0.025
