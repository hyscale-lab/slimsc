Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction uses the product from the first, plus reagent B in water, to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, no, actually looking again, the starting material for the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ product. The second step takes that product (or another similar one) and uses reagent B with water to form a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, maybe I should break it down step by step.

First Reaction:
Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is methylacetone. The reaction is with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Structure-wise, that would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, wait. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN in presence of some reagent. Oh wait, wait, in the presence of acid, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition.
