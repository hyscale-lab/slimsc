Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Let me think this through.

Parallax, right, is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of parallax (in arcseconds). So, plx = 1/distance. That makes sense. So a star with a smaller parallax is farther away because 1 divided by a bigger number is smaller.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Wait, so if we're looking at a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range? Since stars are uniformly distributed, I guess that means the density is uniform in space, so more volume would mean more stars. But I need to relate this to parallax.

Let me think about the volume. The number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume and the density. If the distribution is uniform, the number is proportional to the volume. But volume in three dimensions is tricky here because parallax relates to distance in three-dimensional space.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's say we have a spherical shell at a certain distance. The thickness of this shell would correspond to a small change in parallax. The volume of a thin shell would be something like 4πr² dr, where r is the radius (distance) and dr is the thickness. But parallax is 1/plx, so r is proportional to 1/plx. So r = 1/plx. Then dr would be the change in r, which corresponds to a change in plx. Let's see, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx, since dr/dplx = -1/(plx)^2. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I got the signs right; maybe I can ignore the sign for now since I'm dealing with magnitudes.

So, substituting r = 1/plx into the volume formula. The volume of the shell is 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. Wait, but dr is related to the change in plx. So dr = -dplx/(plx^2). So the volume element would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2). Because dr is positive when plx decreases? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential changes. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe I should express the volume in terms of parallax. So, the volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume between distance r and r + dr, where r = 1/plx and dr is negative since as plx increases, r decreases. Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me approach it differently.

The number of stars in a shell at distance r with thickness dr is proportional to the surface area of the shell times dr. The surface area is 4πr², so the number of stars, N, would be N = n * 4πr² dr, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). Since the distribution is uniform, n is a constant.

Now, parallax plx is 1/r. So r = 1/plx. Let me express everything in terms of plx. So, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Because when plx increases, r decreases. So, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ), but wait, that would be 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

So then N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2) ), which is N = (4π n) * (dplx / plx^4 ). So the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax, so that's N per dplx. So the number per unit plx would be (N) / (dplx) = (4π n / plx^4). So the number density is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. Another way to think about it: the number of stars in a given parallax range (dplx) would depend on the volume that corresponds to that parallax. Since the volume for
