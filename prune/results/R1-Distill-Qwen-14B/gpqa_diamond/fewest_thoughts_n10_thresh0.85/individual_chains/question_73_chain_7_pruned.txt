Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities and energies at relativistic speeds, I can't just use classical mechanics formulas. I think I need to use special relativity equations here.

Alright, let me read the question again. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are about the relative speed and the total energy. I'll need to calculate two things: the relative velocity between them and the total energy of the system.

Starting with the relative speed. Wait, how do you find the relative velocity in special relativity? Oh right, you can't just subtract the velocities like you would in classical mechanics. I remember the formula for adding velocities relativistically. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Since both are moving in the same direction, I subtract their speeds.

So, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. Plugging into the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute numerator and denominator separately. 

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator: (0.3c²)/c² is 0.3, so denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. That's approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel around 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Next, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, so I think I need to calculate each and sum them. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (2m, 0.6c): let's compute gamma. v=0.6c, so v^2/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. Then E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut (3m, 0.5c): v=0.5c, v²/c²=0.25, 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. Then E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc².

Summing E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 mc². So around 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D's E is 5 mc², which is lower. So the correct energy part must be option C.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the total energy of the system. Hmm, in relativity, when considering a system, the total energy is the sum of the energies of each object in the same frame. So I think my approach is right.

So putting it together: relative speed is about 0.14c, total energy is approximately 5.96 mc^2. So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we need to calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:
- Numerator: \(0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c\)
- Denominator: \(1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.142857c \approx 0.14c
\]

So, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativ
