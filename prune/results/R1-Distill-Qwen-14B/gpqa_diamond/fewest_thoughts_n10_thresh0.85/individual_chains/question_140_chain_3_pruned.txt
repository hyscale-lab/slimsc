Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. It says that X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W and form precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, and B's melting point is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm, the question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A to D, with numbers 25, 29, 31, 35.

First, I think I need to figure out what Substance X is. Let's break down the clues.

1. X reacts with a liquid Y. Violently. Common violent reactions often involve metals reacting with acids. For example, metals like sodium or magnesium reacting with water or acids. But wait, Y is a liquid; perhaps it's something like water or maybe an acid.

2. Gas W is released, and its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule is something where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about common gases. For example, H2 has 2 protons but 0 neutrons (since each H is 1 proton and 0 neutrons). So that's not right. What about O2? O is atomic number 8, so each O atom has 8 protons. O2 molecule has 16 protons. If the neutrons are also 16, then each O would have 8 neutrons (because 16 total neutrons for the molecule). Wait, but O's atomic mass is about 16, so that would make each O atom have 8 neutrons. So O2 would have a total of 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Yes, that fits the description. So gas W is O2, oxygen gas.

Wait, no. Let's check: Each H2O molecule has 2 H and 1 O. But that's not a gas in this reaction. Wait, back to the gas. So the molecule must have same number of protons and neutrons in total. Let me think of other possibilities.

Another possibility: If the gas is H2O, but that's a liquid at room temp, so probably not. Alternatively, maybe CO2? But CO2 has 1 C (6 protons) and 2 O (8 each). Wait, the molecule would have 6 + 16 = 22 protons. For neutrons, C has 6 neutrons (since most common is C-12), each O has 8 neutrons (O-16). So 6 + (8*2) = 22 neutrons. So protons=22, neutrons=22. That fits! So gas W could be CO2. But wait, what's the reaction that produces CO2?

Wait, but when a metal reacts with acid, usually you get H2 gas. So if W is H2, then H2 has 2 protons, and 0 neutrons (since each H is 1p and 0n). So protons=2, neutrons=0, which doesn't fit the condition. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the gas W is O2? Let's think: O has 8 protons, and each O atom in O2 has 8 neutrons (O-16). So each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that fits the condition. So W is O2.

So the reaction between X and Y is producing O2. What reactions produce O2 gas? Maybe a metal (like sodium or potassium) reacting with water? Because when metals like Na react with water, they produce H2 gas, but wait, that's not O2. Oh, wait, when metals like sodium react with water, they produce NaOH and H2 gas. So that's not O2.

Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction between a peroxide and an acid. For example, H2O2 (peroxide) reacting with an acid could produce O2. Wait, but Y is a liquid. Could Y be an acid, perhaps sulfuric acid?

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a metal and Y is a peroxide? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of hydrogen peroxide. Hmm. Let's think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms, which upon heating gives B. B's melting point is around 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substances have a melting point around there? Maybe something like water? Wait, water freezes at 273 K (0 C). 277 K is about 4 C. Hmm, but B is the product when G is heated. Let's think: If G is a carbonate, perhaps. Heating a carbonate usually decomposes it into CO2 and a metal oxide. For example, heating CaCO3 gives CaO and CO2.

Wait, but the melting point of B is ~277 K, which is about 4 C. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal oxide. Wait, but what metal oxides have a melting point around 277 K? Hmm, that's a bit low for a solid. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate G is a sulfide? No, because when heated, sulfides decompose, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think back. The reaction between X and Y gives O2. Maybe Y is a strong oxidizing acid, like H2SO4. If X is a metal, perhaps it's sodium. Sodium reacting with H2SO4 would produce Na2SO4, H2 gas, and maybe some heat. But H2 is a gas, but we thought W was O2.

Hmm, maybe X is a peroxide. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2) reacts with an acid. Let's see: Na2O2 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O2, but that might not produce O2. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction that produces O2.

Wait, another angle: The product of X reacting with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let me think about that. Keto acids are like acetoacetic acid, which is a β-keto acid. When a β-keto acid reacts with something like NaOH, perhaps it undergoes a condensation reaction or something. Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe it's a substitution reaction where X replaces a hydrogen in the acid. Wait, perhaps X is a strong base like NaOH. So when a keto acid reacts with NaOH, it could form a salt and water. But I'm not sure how that would result in two oxygen atoms in the product.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a metal, and when it reacts with a keto acid, it forms a metal salt. Let's say the keto acid is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid, but that's not a keto acid; a keto acid has a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid, CH3C(O)CH2COOH). When a metal like Na reacts with acetoacetic acid, it would form the sodium salt,
