Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me look at each reaction carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So, it's a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide like NaCN, that's usually a nucleophilic addition. But wait, in the product, I see a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So, maybe it's a two-step process?

Wait, no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The nitrile group is at the end. So, the molecule would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, but the name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the butane chain has four carbons, with the nitrile at the end (carbon 4), hydroxyl and methyl at carbon 2. So the structure is CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CN. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the structure, but I think the main point is that the ketone is reacting to form a nitrile and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but how does that happen? The reaction between a ketone and NaCN... Oh, wait, I think I remember that when a ketone reacts with HCN, it adds the H to the carbonyl, and the CN- adds to the adjacent carbon, but that's under certain conditions. Or maybe it's a substitution? Wait, no, ketones aren't typically subject to substitution like that. Alternatively, could it be a condensation reaction?

Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. The NaCN provides CN- as a nucleophile. But ketones are usually not very reactive towards nucleophilic additions unless in specific conditions. Oh wait! Maybe it's a hydrocyanation reaction. But wait, hydrocyanation usually adds HCN to alkenes, right? Not ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing some kind of substitution. Or maybe it's a case of the cyanide acting as a base. Wait, another possibility: could the reaction be a condensation to form an imine or something similar, but with CN? Not sure.

Wait, wait. Wait, but the product has a hydroxyl group. Oh! Maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. If the initial product is an addition of CN to the ketone, perhaps that forms an intermediate which then hydrolyzes. Or maybe the first step is adding NaCN to the ketone, and then some acid work-up?

Wait, but the reaction shows that butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives the product. So the conditions A are part of this reaction. What's the role of A?

Wait, another thought: maybe the ketone is being converted to a nitrile via some kind of substitution. But how? That doesn't ring a bell. Alternatively, perhaps it's a protection reaction. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the second reaction. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, looking at the product, the nitrile group (-CN) has been converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So, the nitrile is being oxidized.

In what conditions does a nitrile get oxidized to a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be oxidized using strong oxidizing agents. For example, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or other strong oxidizers like HCl with heat.

Wait, but the second reaction uses reagent B, which is H2O. Hmm, but H2O alone wouldn't do that. Maybe it's in the presence of another reagent. Oh, wait, the reagent B is given as H2O. So perhaps the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis can give either a carboxylic acid or an amide, depending on the conditions. For acid hydrolysis, you usually have H3O+ (like H2SO4) and heat. Alternatively, using a strong base and then acid work-up.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile attached to a 2-hydroxybutane group with a benzylphenyl substituent. When you hydrolyze the nitrile under acidic conditions, it should form a carboxylic acid. So reagent B in the second reaction is H2O, but perhaps with an acid catalyst.

Wait, the reagents for the second reaction are B and H2O. So, perhaps B is an acid like H3O+ or HCl?

Wait, looking at the options, for B, the choices are HCl or CH3COOH. Oh wait, in the second reaction, the reagent is B, and in the options, options A and B say that B is HCl or CH3COOH. So, which one is correct for converting nitrile to carboxylic acid?

Wait, typically, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is done under acidic conditions, like using H2SO4 and heating. Alternatively, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions in aqueous solution. So, in the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O. But B is given as either HCl or CH3COOH. Wait, wait, the question says the reagent is B (H2O). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says the second reaction is with reagent B, which is H2O. So perhaps the reaction uses H2O as the solvent, and B is the catalyst or another reagent.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in aqueous acidic conditions. So, using H3O+ as a catalyst. But the options for B are either HCl or CH3COOH. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the first reaction. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, perhaps the ketone is undergoing some kind of addition of CN-.

Wait, but how? Maybe it's a condensation reaction. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh! Yes, that's right. A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with HCN in the presence of a catalyst. The reaction adds HCN to the carbonyl group, creating a new carbon-carbon bond. So, the product would have a hydroxyl group and a cyano group attached to the same carbon.

Wait, but in the product, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. So, that makes sense for a cyanohydrin formation. So, the reagent A must be providing the HCN or the conditions for HCN addition.

Wait, but the reagent is NaCN. Hmm. NaCN would provide CN- ions. But HCN is a weak acid. So, in order to get HCN to form, you need an acidic condition. Because HCN is a weak acid, it won't form spontaneously in basic conditions. So, the reaction between ketone and NaCN would require an acidic condition to generate HCN from NaCN.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- in a basic solution. Hmm, but if you add H3O+ (which is a strong acid), it would protonate CN- to form HCN. So, in the first reaction, NaCN is present along with a strong acid, H3O+.

So, reagent A is H3O+.

Wait, but let me think again. The reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So, the conditions are probably acid catalyzed. So, H3O+ would be the right choice for A. That would make option A or B as possible choices.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says A is H3O+ and B is HCl. Option B has A as H3O+ and B as CH3COOH. Hmm.

Now, the second reaction is the nitrile group being converted to a carboxylic acid. So, the product is a carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile undergoes hydrolysis.

What are the conditions for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid? It's typically done under strong acidic conditions, like H2SO4 and heat, or using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 in acidic conditions.

But in the second reaction, the reagent is B and H2O. So, perhaps the conditions are aqueous acid. So, B would be a source of H+ ions, like HCl or H3O+.

Looking at the options, for B, the second reaction uses either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, so the second reaction is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile derivative reacting with B (H2O) to form the corresponding acid. So, the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile.

In acidic conditions, the nitrile hydrolyzes to the carboxylic acid. So, the reagent B would be an acid. So, options are HCl or CH3COOH.

HCl is a strong acid, which would provide H+ ions. CH3COOH is a weak acid.

Which is a better catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis? Strong acid conditions are usually used because H+ helps in the protonation steps.

So, reagent B would be HCl (a strong acid), which is option A or C.

Wait, but what about the first reaction? We thought A is H3O+. So, looking at the options, option A has A = H3O+ and B = HCl.

But let me check the options again. The options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, if A is H3O+ and B is HCl, that corresponds to option A.

Wait, but wait. The second reaction is in the presence of H2O and reagent B. So, perhaps B is the acid. So, for the second reaction, we need H+ to facilitate the hydrolysis.

So, B is HCl, which is a strong acid, making option A correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction uses a different acid. Let me think about the two reactions again.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So, the conditions are acidic, because H3O+ is present. That leads to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

Second reaction: the nitrile (from the first product) is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid under acidic conditions. So, the reagent B is providing the acid.

So, the correct reagents are A = H3O+, B = HCl. That's option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

But wait, another possibility: the second reaction might use a different acid. Let me think about the hydrolysis of nitriles. It can be done in two ways: either under basic or acidic conditions. Under acidic conditions, it typically requires heat and a strong acid like HCl.

So, for the second reaction, the presence of H2O and HCl would provide the acidic aqueous solution needed for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

So, putting it all together, the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, and the second uses HCl as B. So, option A is the correct choice.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check. The first reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN plus A. So, the conditions must be acidic because H3O+ is a strong acid, which would help generate HCN from NaCN. Then, in the second reaction, the nitrile is hydrolyzed in acidic conditions (using HCl as B) to form the carboxylic acid.

So yes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is option A.


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one (a ketone) with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This reaction is consistent with the formation of a cyanohydrin, where HCN adds to the carbonyl group of the ketone. For HCN to form from NaCN, an acidic environment is required. Therefore, reagent A must be a strong acid, such as H₃O⁺, which provides the necessary protons to generate HCN.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl. Therefore, reagent B must be HCl to facilitate this transformation.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is less effective than HCl for the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it does not provide the necessary acidic environment for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct choice is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
