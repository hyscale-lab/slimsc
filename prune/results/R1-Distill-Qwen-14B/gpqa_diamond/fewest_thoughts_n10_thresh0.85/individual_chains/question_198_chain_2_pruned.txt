Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, first I need to recall what stability constants mean. Stability constant (β) is a measure of the stability of a complex ion. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. For a complex like Co(SCN)_n, the formation would go in steps, each with its own β. So the overall β would be the product of β1, β2, etc., up to βn.

In this case, there are four β values, so the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^2+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-. Oh wait, but wait, the question specifically mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands, so that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So the question is about the percentage of this complex in the solution.

So I need to calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 among all the possible cobalt species. The species present would be the free Co^2+ ion and all the possible complexes. So the total concentration is the sum of all these species.

The way to approach this is using the formation of complexes step by step. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex, considering their stability constants, and then sum them up. But since [SCN-] is much higher than the Co concentration, maybe the solution is dominated by the higher-order complexes, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the total concentration of Co is 0.01 M and SCN- is 0.1 M. Since SCN- is in excess, the formation
