Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The problem says that this situation can look like an exoplanet transiting the star. We need to find the radius of such an exoplanet that would produce the same light curve amplitude as the spot-induced variations. 

Wait, so the star's brightness changes because of the spots. When the spots are on the visible side, the star appears dimmer, making a dip in brightness. The same thing happens when a planet transits (passes in front of) the star; the planet blocks some light, causing a dip. We need to find the planet's radius that would cause the same dip as the spots.

Hmm. So, the key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness (the amplitude) when the spots are on the star, and then set that equal to the change caused by a planet transit, then solve for the planet's radius.

Let me think about how brightness changes due to spots and due to a planet.

First, when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is given by the formula:

ΔF_planet = (R_planet / R_star)^2

Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius. So, the fractional change in brightness is (R_p / R_s)^2.

Now, for the star with spots: the brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the side facing us, the total brightness is lower.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. The 'filling factor' is 20%—so 0.2 of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Since the star is a sphere, but we're only seeing one hemisphere (since it's a star, we see the whole surface when it's not rotating, but in this case, spots are on one hemisphere, so as it rotates, the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, but the problem says one hemisphere is covered with spots. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. But wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface. If 20% of that hemisphere is spots, then 0.2 * (π R^2) is the area of the spots.

Wait no, because a hemisphere is half the sphere, so the area of the hemisphere is 2π R² (since the total surface area is 4π R², so hemisphere is half, which is 2π R²). So the total area covered by spots in the hemisphere is 20% of that, which is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4π R². So the spots cover 0.2 * (hem
