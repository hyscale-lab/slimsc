Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how its brightness variations can be compared to an exoplanet's effect. Hmm.

So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. Wait, the Sun's radius is about 700,000 km, but maybe I don't need the exact number right now. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, same as the Sun, I think. Oh, but wait, no, the Sun is actually around 5778K, so this star is a bit hotter. But I'm not sure if that matters for the problem at hand.

The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Oh, filling factor—right, that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So 20% of the hemisphere is spots. Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star's surface, so the total area covered by spots would be 0.2 * (πR²/2), right? Or maybe I should think in terms of the entire star's surface. Wait, no, the filling factor is usually the fraction of the visible hemisphere, so if one hemisphere is covered 20%, then 20% of that half is spots. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π R² / 2) = 0.1 π R². Hmm.

The spots are cooler, but the problem states a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spot temperature is Teff - 1000K = 5000K. Oh wait, no, wait the star's Teff is 6000K, so the spots are at 5000K. Or wait, the problem says "temperature difference of 1000K." So if the star is 6000K, the spots are either 5000K or 6000+1000=7000K. Wait, but dark spots are usually cooler, so probably 5000K.

So the star is being observed, and the spots cause brightness variations as the star rotates. The question states that this can resemble an exoplanet. So the idea is that the dip in brightness when a planet transits the star is similar to the dip caused by spots on the star. So the question is, to produce the same amplitude in the light curve, what exoplanet radius would be needed, assuming no spots.

So, the problem is comparing the effect of a planet transit to the effect of spots modulating the star's brightness.

Wait, so without spots, the star's brightness wouldn't vary due to spots. But in reality, when spots rotate into and out of view, the observed brightness decreases because the spots are cooler and emit less light. So the brightness variation is due to the spots covering a part of the star's surface as it rotates.

So the question is asking, what planet radius would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do. So, the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same for both scenarios.

Let me think about the two effects separately.

First, the effect of the planet. When a planet transits the star, the observed brightness drops by an amount proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. So the fractional change is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of radius.

Second, the effect of the spots. The spots cause a dip in brightness when they are on the visible side. The dip depends on how much less light the spots emit compared to the rest of the star.

Wait, let's model the brightness from the star. The star's total luminosity is L = 4π R_star^2 σ Teff^4. The spots have a lower temperature, so their contribution is L_spot = 4π (area of spots) σ T_spot^4.

The total observed flux when spots are visible is L_total - L_spot. But wait, actually, when the star rotates, the spots are either on the side facing us or not. So the maximum dip occurs when the spots are fully facing us. So the dip in flux is (L_spot / L_total) × 100%.

Wait, but no. Because spots are cooler, their emission is less than the surrounding. So when the star is spot-free, the flux is maximum. When a spot comes into view, the total flux decreases by the amount that the spot contributes.

So the fractional change ΔF in flux would
