Okay, so I've got this question here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm... I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator models, but in this case, it's the rotation-vibration or non-rigid rotor model. Wait, I think the non-rigid rotor accounts for bond length changes, unlike the rigid rotor which assumes a fixed bond length. Right, so the model considers both rotation and vibration.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state—oh right, that's the lowest energy state. So for a diatomic, the fundamental state would be the ground state of both rotational and vibrational energy levels. But wait, the rotation-vibration model combines these, so maybe the fundamental state is when both rotation and vibration are in their lowest states. Or perhaps it's the lowest state considering both modes. Hmm, I might need to think about that.

The problem is asking about the momentum of a photon that needs to be absorbed for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, so it's about a transition. The next state with the lowest possible energy... I think that would be the next energy level, possibly the first excited state.

Wait, what's the next state? If the molecule is in the ground state, the next possible state would involve either a change in rotation, vibration, or both. Since it's the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve changes in both rotational and vibrational quantum numbers. But I'm a bit confused about which transition is the next lowest energy.

I think in spectroscopy, the selection rules for diatomic molecules usually allow Δv = ±1 for vibr
