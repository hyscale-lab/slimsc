Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The more massive the planet, the bigger the shift, right? But wait, no, actually the shift also depends on the planet's orbit. Or maybe it's the velocity of the star that's causing the shift. Oh right, the star moves in response to the planet, so the shift is related to the star's velocity.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So, same star mass, same planet mass, but different RV shifts. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 has 7. They're asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, orbital period depends on the distance from the star and the star's mass. Oh right, Kepler's third law. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) ) * a³. Since the stars have the same mass as the Sun and the planets' masses are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun, M >> m, so we can approximate it as P² = (4π²/(G M)) * a³, where M is the star's mass.

But how does the RV shift relate to the orbital period? The RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = [ (G P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) ] * (M_p sin i) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think about it more simply. The RV shift is proportional to the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the distance (semi-major axis). Since the planets have the same mass, the star's velocity would depend on how tightly they're bound, which relates to the period.

Wait, more precisely, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2) ) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * ( (2π)/P )^(1/3) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator simplifies. So K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2))^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe another way. Let's think about the formula for K. K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * c) )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the relation between the RV shift and the orbital period. Since the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbital speed. But I'm
