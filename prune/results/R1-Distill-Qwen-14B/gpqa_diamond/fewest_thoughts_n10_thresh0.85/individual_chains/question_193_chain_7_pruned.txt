Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? So parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

Wait, the formula given is number of stars N = 1 / plx^5. Or more accurately, N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

I think parallax is measured in arcseconds, and it's given by plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. That makes sense because the closer an object is, the larger its parallax. So plx is inversely proportional to r.

So if I substitute plx with 1/r, then N is proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that. Let's see:

1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So is it about the number per unit distance, like the density?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, so N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, that becomes N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases by r^5. But
