Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are multiple steps, and a couple of hints given. Let me break it down.

First, compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B. Then, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C. Next, compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and then D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

The options are various cyclic ketones, like cyclohexanone derivatives. The IR data: A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1, which is a bit lower, maybe indicating a different carbonyl environment, but not sure yet.

Looking at the hints: Hint a says that when A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. So A must be an aldehyde or ketone since Wittig reactions are between ylides and carbonyl compounds.

Wait, the product of the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that structure. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1,2, and 4. Positions 1 and 2 are methyl groups, and position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, right? So the structure would have a cyclopentane ring with methyl groups on carbons 1 and 2, and a substituent that's a CH2-C(CH3)= group on carbon 4.

Wait, but wait. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes. So the starting material (A) should be a ketone or aldehyde. Since the product has a cyclopentane ring with a substituent that's a double bond, perhaps A is a cyclopentanone derivative.

Alternatively, maybe A is a ketone with a cyclopentane ring. Let me think: if A is, say, a cyclopentanone with substituents, then the Wittig would add a new double bond next to the ketone.

Wait, the product after Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The propan-2-ylidene is (CH3)2C=CH-. No, wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)-. So the substituent is a CH2 group connected to a C(CH3)= group attached to the cyclopentane ring.

So the structure would have a cyc
