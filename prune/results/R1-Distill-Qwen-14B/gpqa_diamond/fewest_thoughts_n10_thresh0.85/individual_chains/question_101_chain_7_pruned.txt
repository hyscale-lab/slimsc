Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find the right reagent A and catalyst B.

Hmm, let's think about what's happening here. The product looks like a bicyclic compound. The structure 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl) suggests that the pyrrolidine is attached to a cyclohexylidene group, which is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond. Wait, cyclohexylidene methyl would be a cyclohexene ring connected via a CH2 group, maybe? Or perhaps it's a fused ring.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine has four carbons in the ring, right? Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring. So 3-methyl would have a methyl group on carbon 3. The product has something attached to the 1-position.

So the reaction is an acid-catalyzed reaction. Let me think about possible reactions that form new rings. Maybe an aldol reaction? Or perhaps a Robinson annulation? Or maybe it's a ring-forming reaction like a cycloaddition.

Wait, the product structure suggests that a new ring is formed. Let me visualize it. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidene methyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the pyrrolidine ring is connected to a cyclohexene ring through a CH2 group. Or wait, cyclohexylidene methyl is probably CH2-cyclohexene, so maybe it's a bridge between the two rings.

Wait, perhaps it's a conjugate addition or a Michael addition? Or maybe an enamine reaction? Wait, that could be it. Enamine chemistry is often involved in forming rings.

Enamines are formed from amines and ketones or aldehydes, typically under acidic conditions. The process involves forming a Schiff base, which then loses water to form the enamine. Enamines can undergo various reactions, like Michael additions or cycloadditions, but in this case
