Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's go through the information step by step.

First, the problem gives me the results from three different characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My goal is to use these to determine which formula among the options is correct. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data. The IR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in the IR typically correspond to O-H stretching vibrations. A very broad peak suggests it might be an -OH group, like in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak, so that's a possibility. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, the peak is usually broader but can sometimes be a bit less so than a carboxylic acid. Another thought: maybe it's a hydroxyl group in an ester or something else. But the broad peak here is pointing towards the presence of an -OH group.

Then, there are two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a region where carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb. The 1650 might be another type of carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ketone. But another possibility is that the 1650 is a C=C stretch, but wait, the 1650 is a bit lower than the typical for C=C. Oh, but wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. For example, in a ketone that's not very strong, but if it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, like in an enone, the carbonyl might show a bit lower wavenumber due to conjugation. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretch. Hmm. So, the 1700 is probably a C=O, and the 1650 might be a C=C, possibly conjugated with something.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data: several peaks, including those corresponding
