Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which of these symmetries are respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, first I should recall what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes translations and Lorentz transformations, so it's a bigger symmetry group. Then there's CP, which is Charge conjugation and Parity symmetry together, and CPT symmetry which combines Charge, Parity, and Time reversal.

In SMEFT, the operators are built from the Standard Model fields, right? And each operator is classified by its dimension. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the underlying theory's symmetries.

But wait, which symmetries must operators respect? Let me think about each option. 

Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected because the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. All terms in the Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars. So every operator must transform in a way that keeps the theory Lorentz symmetric. So 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry (2) includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. But wait, translation symmetry implies momentum conservation, which is tied to the existence of a conserved energy-momentum tensor. However, in SMEFT, the operators have higher dimensions, and the theory is effective. But does it respect Poincare symmetry? Hmm, I think that SMEFT is a Poincare-invariant theory because effective theories inherit the symmetries of the underlying theory, which in this case (assuming it's a high-energy theory) respects Poincare. Wait, but wait, the point is that all operators must be compatible with Poincare. But wait, I remember that the SMEFT operators can have terms that break certain symmetries, but wait, no—wait, SMEFT is built as an effective theory, so it must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT must as well. So 2 is correct.

Wait, but wait, no. SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators. But if the underlying theory (like the Standard Model) respects Poincare symmetry, then the SMEFT operators must also respect it. So yes, Poincare is a symmetry that all SMEFT operators must respect.

But wait, another point: the Poincare symmetry includes momentum conservation. Because effective theories are organized by their dimension, any operator must be a renormalizable term plus higher order. But in terms of symmetry, the effective theory must still be Poincare invariant. So I think options 1 and 2 are correct. So options 1 and 2, which is what option A says (A is 1,2).

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator violates a symmetry, that's a no-go. So for example, if an operator isn't a Lorentz scalar, it would be problematic. So all operators must be Lorentz-invariant, so 1 is correct. Same for Poincare, but wait, Poincare requires both translation and Lorentz. But wait, the SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, but do the operators have to respect translation symmetry?

Wait, perhaps the question is more about gauge symmetries and Lorentz. Wait, no, the question is about which symmetries must all operators respect. So, for example, the SMEFT is built to respect the same gauge symmetries as the Standard Model. But that's not part of the options here.

Wait, but the options here are about Lorentz, Poincare, CP, CPT. So, the theory as a whole must respect these, but whether each operator must respect them. I think that the operators must individually respect Lorentz symmetry because each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar. So 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translation. For the Lagrangian to be translationally invariant, the terms must have definite scaling dimensions. But wait, higher-dimensional operators have higher scaling dimensions, so perhaps each operator doesn't have to have the same scaling. Wait, but for the Lagrangian to be Poincare-invariant, each term must be a scalar (Lorentz) and have the right dimension to allow for proper integration (like each term must have the correct number of derivatives and fields so that the action is dimensionless in natural units). But I'm not sure if that's the same as Poincare symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps all terms in the Lagrangian transform as Poincare scalars. Since the Standard Model respects Poincare, SMEFT as an effective theory must also respect it. Therefore, each operator must be a Poincare scalar.

Wait, but Poincare includes translations. So, an operator that isn't a scalar under translations would break that symmetry. But all operators in the SMEFT must be scalars under Poincare, so 2 is also correct. So options 1 and 2 are correct, so A would be the answer.

But wait, is Poincare symmetry automatically satisfied if Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry are each satisfied? Because the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if each operator is a Lorentz scalar and a translation scalar, then Poincare is respected.

Wait, but the Standard Model respects Poincare, so the SMEFT must as well. So all operators must respect Poincare. So 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you write effective theories, you can have operators that are not translationally invariant, but I think that's not the case. Because the effective theory must still have the same symmetries as the underlying theory, which is Poincare. So yes, all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So options 1 and 2 are correct, so the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait, another thought: Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation. So if an operator is a Lorentz scalar but not a translation scalar, would it violate Poincare? No, because each term in the Lagrangian is a scalar under translations. Wait, but in the effective theory, each operator's dimension has to match so that when integrated with the appropriate measure, the action is dimensionless. But that's about scaling dimensions, not translation symmetry itself. So perhaps each operator is a scalar under translations, meaning that Poincare is preserved.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that SMEFT operators are built as products of SM fields and their derivatives, arranged to be Lorentz scalars. So the operators are automatically Poincare scalars as well because they are scalars under Lorentz and their structure doesn't involve any momentum dependence that would break translation symmetry.

Wait, but each operator is part of the Lagrangian, which must be a scalar under Poincare. So each term in the Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar. Thus, all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare. So 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So 1 and 2 are correct. So the first option is A, which is 1 and 2.

But wait, another thought. The Poincare group includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries, but translation symmetry is a global symmetry. In quantum field theory, the generators of translations are the energy-momentum. For the Lagrangian to respect translation symmetry, it must be invariant under space-time translations. So each operator must be a scalar under translation, meaning that the operator can't have any factors that make it non-scalar under translations. But in the SMEFT, each operator is a product of SM fields and derivatives, which are scalars under translations. So yes, 2 is correct.

Wait, but wait, is the SMEFT Lagrangian translation-invariant? Yes, because the effective theory is built to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So 1 and 2 are correct.

Then, what about CP and CPT? Do all SMEFT operators have to respect those?

CP symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation and parity. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric; for example, CP violation occurs in the CKM matrix. So the SMEFT operators can violate CP. Therefore, option 3 is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators. So operators can include terms that break CP.

CPT symmetry is a combination of charge, parity, and time reversal. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry. So all operators in the SMEFT must be compatible with CPT symmetry. Because if the underlying theory (Standard Model) respects CPT, the effective theory (SMEFT) must as well. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, but can the SMEFT operators violate CPT? Since the underlying theory respects CPT, then all operators must be CPT-invariant. Because if a term existed that violates CPT, that would imply a breakdown in the underlying theory's CPT symmetry, which we assume holds.

So, based on this reasoning, which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect?

1. Lorentz Symmetry — yes
2. Poincare Symmetry — yes
3. CP Symmetry — no, because operators can have CP-violating terms
4. CPT Symmetry — yes

So the correct options are 1, 2, and 4. Wait, but looking back at the choices, option C is 1,2,4. So that's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 1 and 2 are correct, but now I'm considering 4 as correct as well. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but wait: the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So which of these symmetries are automatically respected by all operators in SMEFT.

So:

- Lorentz Symmetry: all operators must be scalars under Lorentz, so yes.

- Poincare Symmetry: all operators must be scalars under Poincare, which includes Lorentz and translations. So yes.

- CP Symmetry: no, because some operators can break CP. For example, operators that are not CP-even, such as those with (ψ̄ γ^5 ψ)^2, which is CP-even, but others can have CP-odd terms, but wait, wait, no, in the SMEFT, operators can be constructed to have various CP properties, but they don't have to be symmetric under CP. So not all operators respect CP, hence 3 is not correct.

- CPT Symmetry: must be respected. Because the underlying theory (Standard Model) respects CPT, so all effective operators must be CPT invariant. So 4 must be correct.

So the correct options are 1, 2, and 4. So looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So the answer is C.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: the underlying theory (Standard Model) respects CPT, so any operator added to SMEFT must be CPT invariant. Because otherwise, the effective theory would violate CPT, which the Standard Model doesn't. So all SMEFT operators must be CPT-invariant.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1,2,4. So the correct answer is option C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are constructed from Standard Model (SM) fields and their derivatives, and they must respect the symmetries of the underlying SM. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: All operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars because the Lagrangian must be invariant under Lorentz transformations. This is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic quantum field theory, including SMEFT. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is an effective theory built to respect the same symmetries as the SM, it must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Each term in the Lagrangian must be a Poincaré scalar, meaning it must transform appropriately under both Lorentz and translation transformations. Thus, Poincaré symmetry must be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The SM is not CP-symmetric due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. Therefore, SMEFT operators do not need to respect CP symmetry, and some operators can explicitly violate CP. Hence, CP symmetry does not need to be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). The SM respects CPT symmetry, and as an effective theory, SMEFT must also respect CPT symmetry. Any operator in SMEFT that violates CPT would imply a breakdown of CPT in the underlying SM, which is not observed. Therefore, CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz Symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré Symmetry (2)**, and **CPT Symmetry (4)**. The correct option is:

**C) 1, 2, 4**

Answer: C
