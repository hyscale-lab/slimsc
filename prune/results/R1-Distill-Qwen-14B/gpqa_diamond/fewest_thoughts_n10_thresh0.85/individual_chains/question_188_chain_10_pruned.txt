Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, which is a bit tricky for me because I'm still getting the hang of all these terms and formulas. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given data are the interatomic distance, which I think is the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Hmm, wait, I should make sure about what a rhombohedral crystal is. I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all edges equal (a = b = c) and all angles are the same (alpha = beta = gamma). So, yeah, that's what's given here.

Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula I recall for interplanar distances is d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ))), but wait, wait. Maybe I got that wrong. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But rhombohedral isn't cubic because the angles aren't 90 degrees, so the formula must be more complicated.

Wait, I think the formula for rhombohedral is similar to the cubic case but includes the angles. The general formula for any crystal system is d = (a)/(√(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ)) ). Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Oh, right, for a rhombohedral crystal (which is a special case of a hexagonal or something?), or maybe it's a type of triclinic? No, no, rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic where the angles are all equal but not 90 degrees. So the lattice parameters are a = b = c, but angles can vary.

So the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) in a rhombohedral system would be given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos α ), because in this case a = b = c and all angles are equal to α (since α = β = gamma).

Wait, let me double-check. When a = b = c and angles are all equal, the expression simplifies. So the denominator becomes sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos α + 2kl cos α ). Which can be factored as sqrt( (h + k + l)^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos α - 1) )? Hmm, maybe that's complicating things more.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as d = a/(sqrt(1 + 2cos
