Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Oh wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer and also in the same direction as the light beam. So the setup is a bit tricky. I remember something about how the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's motion.

Wait, in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But when the medium is moving, things get a bit different, right? Or is that only for the medium itself?

Wait, the problem specifies that the glass is moving, and the light is within the glass. So the light's speed in the glass is normally c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So, speed in medium is v_medium = c/n.

But wait, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed of the light?

I think this is a relativistic problem, but maybe it's non-relativistic since the velocity v is probably much less than c. Let me think. Maybe I can use the relativistic velocity addition formula? Or perhaps a simpler approach since the speeds are small.

Wait, the medium itself is moving. So the light's speed relative to the lab frame would be
