Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, the question says it's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So it binds to calcium ions. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its active form, ready to complex with Ca²+.

The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. Wait, I think K here refers to the formation constant, Kf, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- with Kf = 5e10.

The problem is to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So, even though the solution has the complex, some of it dissociates, releasing Ca²+ ions. I need to calculate that concentration.

I remember that for such a complexation equilibrium, the formation constant Kf is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this case, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since it's stoichiometric, I assume that all the Ca and EDTA come from the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, no. The solution is made by having 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, before any dissociation, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are zero. But as the solution reaches equilibrium, a tiny amount x dissociates, so:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

So, let x be the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium. Then:

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation is very small. So x should be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the Kf expression becomes:

Kf = (0.02)/(x * x) = 5e10.

So 0.02 / x² = 5e10. Rearranging, x² = 0.02 / (5e10).

Calculating that:

0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13. Taking square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-1
