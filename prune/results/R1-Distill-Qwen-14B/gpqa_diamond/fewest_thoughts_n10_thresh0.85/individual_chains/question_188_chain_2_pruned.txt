Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm trying to figure out the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that in crystallography, interplanar distances are calculated using something called the Bragg equation or maybe the interplanar spacing formula. Wait, no, Bragg's law is about diffraction. Oh right, the interplanar distance formula involves the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

So the crystal is rhombohedral, which means all the edges are the same length, right? And all the angles are equal too. In this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, which is the lattice parameter 'a' because in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a cube with all sides equal and angles equal as well. Wait, no, wait, wait. In a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is rhombohedral, so the unit cell has all sides equal but the angles are not 90 degrees. So the lattice is a rhombohedron. So the lattice parameter 'a' is the same for all edges, and the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees here.

So the problem is to find the interplanar distance (d) for the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ), but wait, I'm not sure if that's the exact formula. Alternatively, I think for a general crystal, the interplanar distance for plane (hkl) is given by d = a/(
