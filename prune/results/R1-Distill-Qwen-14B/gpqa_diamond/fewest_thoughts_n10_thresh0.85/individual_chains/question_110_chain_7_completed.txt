Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO and HIRES have different magnitude limits. Let me think about the details.

The question provides a bunch of stars with various properties. My goal is to figure out which stars are bright enough for both instruments. Oh right, the key here is apparent magnitude because both telescopes can only detect stars brighter than a certain V magnitude.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So that means a star must have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17 to be detected. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V <=16.

Wait, no, wait. When it says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, does that mean the magnitude is less than or equal to 17? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17, it's magnitude is less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, m_V <17. For HIRES, m_V <16. So a star needs to have an apparent magnitude less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. So for both, the apparent magnitude must be less than 16, because if it's less than 16, it's automatically less than 17. So any star that can be detected by HIRES can also be detected by ESPRESSO, but the converse isn't necessarily true.

Wait, no. Because the question is asking which stars can be detected with both. So a star must be bright enough for both. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, it can't be detected by HIRES because HIRES requires brighter than 16. Wait, no, the way the problem is phrased is:

"with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed."

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So which is which? So ESPRESSO can observe stars that are brighter than 17 mag. That would mean the apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because higher magnitudes are fainter. So, for example, a star with m=16 is brighter than m=17, so it can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so their m_V <16.

So for a star to be observed by both, it must have m_V <17 (for ESPRESSO) and m_V <16 (for HIRES). So the stricter condition is m_V <16. Because if a star is brighter than 16 (m_V <16), then it's also brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So the star must be apparent magnitude less than 16.

Wait, but wait. Let me rephrase: the lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. So if a star has an apparent magnitude of 15, it's brighter than one with 16, which is brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars up to 17, which includes all stars with m_V ≤17. HIRES can observe stars up to 16, so m_V ≤16.

So a star that can be observed by both must have m_V ≤16 because that's the lower threshold. So, which stars have m_V ≤16? Let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, distance 10 pc. Wait, absolute magnitude is M_V. So we need to calculate apparent magnitude m_V. The formula is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs.

So for Star1: M=15.5, d=10pc. So m =15.5 +5 +5*log10(10). log10(10)=1, so 5*1=5. So m=15.5 +5 +5 =25.5? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) +5. Because 5*(log10(d) - 1). So for d=10, log10(10)=1, 5*(1) =5. So m=15.5+5=20.5. Oh wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Wait, the formula is m - M = 5 log10(d) -5. So m = M +5 log10(d) -5? No, wait, correct formula: m = M + 5 log10 (d) + 5. Because when d=10 pc, m = M +5. Because 5 log10(10)=5.

So Star1: M=15.5, d=10. m =15.5 +5 =20.5. So apparent V mag is 20.5. That's way fainter than both 16 and 17, so neither ESPRESSO nor HIRES can see it. So Star1 is out.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. So m=16.5. That's over 16, so HIRES can't see it (needs m ≤16). But ESPRESSO can see up to m=17, so Star2's m=16.5 is within ESPRESSO's limit. So Star2 can be detected by ESPRESSO only, not HIRES. So Star2 is out for the both condition.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5. Wait, but also E(B-V) is 0.6. Oh wait, because interstellar extinction (dust) affects apparent magnitude. So the observed (apparent) magnitude is affected by extinction. The formula given is that total absorption in V band is 3.1 * E(B-V). So the extinction A_V=3.1 * E(B-V).

So for Star3, E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V=3.1 *0.6 =1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. Wait wait, no. Wait, when a star is behind dust, its apparent magnitude increases (since it's dimmer). So if the star's unreddened magnitude is m0, then the observed m = m0 + A_V. So for Star3, the given m is 15.5, but we have to add the extinction. So m_observed=15.5 +1.86=17.36. Oh, that's above 17. So Star3's m is 17.36. So ESPRESSO can't observe it because it requires m <17. HIRES can't either, since it requires m <16. So Star3 is out.

Star4: Absolute V mag=15.5, distance=10 pc. So calculate m. M=15.5, d=10. m=15.5 +5 log10(10) =15.5+5=20.5. But wait, Star4 also has E(B-V)=0.4. So A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So m_observed=20.5 +1.24=21.74. That's much higher than both 16 and 17. So Star4 is too faint for both. So Star4 is out.

Wait, but wait, what about Star5? So Star5: Absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. So M=16.5, d=5. So m =16.5 +5 log10(5) +5?

Wait, no, correct formula: m = M +5 log10(d) -5? No, perhaps I should re-express it correctly.

Wait, the correct formula is m = M + 5 log10 (d / 10 pc). So if d is in parsecs, then m = M +5 (log10 d) -5. Because when d is 10 pc, it's M +5*1 -5 = M.

So for Star5: d=5 pc. So log10(5)=~0.698. So m =16.5 +5*(0.698) -5?

Wait wait, no. Let's think again. The formula is m = M + 5 log10 (d) -5.

So for d=5, log10(5)=0.698. So 5 * 0.698 ≈3.49. So m=16.5 +3.49 -5 =16.5 + (-1.51)=14.99. Approximately 15.0 mag.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Another way: m - M = 5 log10 (d) -5.

So for d=5 pc: log10(5) ≈0.69897. So 5 *0.69897 ≈3.4949. So m - M =3.4949 -5 = -1.5051. So m= M -1.5051.

M is 16.5. So m=16.5 -1.5051 ≈14.995, about 15.0 mag.

So Star5's apparent magnitude is 15.0. But wait, does it have any extinction? The question says E(B-V)=0.4, but wait, for Star5, I don't see any mention of E(B-V). Let me check the description again.

Looking back: Star3 has E(B-V)=0.6, Star4 also has E(B-V)=0.4. Star5's description: "absolute V mag of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us." No mention of E(B-V), so I think Star5 has E(B-V)=0, so no extinction. So its m_observed is 15.0.

So Star5's m=15.0. That's less than 16 and 17. So it can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

Wait, but wait, what about Star3 again. Let me recheck. Star3's m is given as 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V=1.86. So m_observed=15.5+1.86=17.36. So m=17.36, which is above both 16 and 17. So Star3 is too faint.

Wait, but wait, in Star3's case: the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but after adding extinction, it's 17.36, which is above the ESPRESSO limit of 17. So Star3 can't be observed by either.

So the only star that can be observed by both is Star5, with m=15.0, which is less than 16 and 17.

Wait, but wait, what about Star2. Star2's m is 16.5, which is above HIRES's limit, but within ESPRESSO's. So Star2 can't be observed by HIRES.

So let's look at each star:

Star1: m=20.5. Fainter than both. No.
Star2: m=16.5. Fainter than HIRES (needs <16), but can be seen by ESPRESSO. No.
Star3: m_observed=17.36. Fainter than both. No.
Star4: m_observed=21.74. No.
Star5: m=15.0. Can be seen by both.

Wait, but wait. Did I miss any other star?

Wait, looking back, the options are:

Options:
A) Star4 and Star5
B) Star3 and Star5
C) Star2 and Star3
D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, from my analysis, only Star5 can be seen by both. So none of the options have only Star5. But the options are pairs.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the stars.

Wait, what about Star3? I thought its m=15.5 but with extinction. Hmm, no, because when you add extinction, the apparent magnitude increases. So m_observed =15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Which is more than 17. So Star3 can't be observed by either. So Star3 is out.

Wait, what about Star4? Star4's M=15.5, d=10pc. So m =15.5 +5=20.5. But E(B-V)=0.4, A_V=3.1*0.4=1.24. So m_observed=20.5 +1.24=21.74. So way beyond both.

Wait, what about Star5. Yes, m=15.0. So can be seen by both.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations, because maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, for Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

Compute m:

m - M = 5 log10(d) -5.

log10(5)=0.69897.

So 5 * 0.69897 ≈3.4949.

So m -16.5 =3.4949 -5 = -1.5051.

So m=16.5-1.5051=14.9949, about 15.0.

So m=15.0, which is below 16 and 17, so can be observed by both.

Is there any other star that can be observed by both?

Looking back, perhaps I missed Star4? Let me recheck.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc, so m=15.5 +5=20.5. But with E(B-V)=0.4, so A_V=1.24. So m_observed=20.5+1.24=21.74. Fainter than both, so no.

Wait, what about Star2: m=16.5. So for HIRES, which requires m <16, Star2's m=16.5 is too faint. So only ESPRESSO can see it.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe for Star2, if the given apparent magnitude is 16.5, but there's some extinction, would that make it even fainter? Let me check the description of Star2.

Star2's description doesn't mention E(B-V). So it's 16.5 mag, but without any extinction. So m=16.5. So it's fainter than HIRES's limit, but within ESPRESSO's. So only ESPRESSO can see it.

So the only star that's bright enough for both is Star5.

Wait, but the options are all pairs. So if only Star5 can be seen by both, then what's the correct option?

Looking at the options again:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4: m=21.74, no. So option A is out.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't be seen by either, so option B is out.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Both can't be seen by HIRES, so option C is out.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Both can't be seen by either, so option D is out.

Wait, this is a problem because none of the options have only Star5. Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake in calculating the apparent magnitudes.

Wait, let me re-examine the stars.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for extinction in Star4. Wait, Star4's m is 20.5 (without extinction). After adding A_V=1.24, m=21.74. So no.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated Star5's apparent magnitude.

Wait, Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

Wait, let me compute log10(5) correctly. log10(5) is approximately 0.69897.

So 5 log10(5) ≈5 *0.69897 =3.49485.

So m =16.5 +3.49485 -5 =16.5 -1.50515=14.99485 → ~15.0.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star5's m.

Alternatively, perhaps Star5 has an absolute magnitude that's too high, but distance is short. Let's think: M=16.5 is relatively bright, but at 5 pc, would that make it bright enough?

Wait, M is the absolute magnitude. So for a star with M=16.5, at 5 pc, m is about 15.0. Which is bright enough for both.

So Star5 can be observed by both.

But the options don't have an option that includes only Star5. So perhaps I made an error in considering the stars.

Wait, let me look again at each star.

Wait, Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, so that's fainter than Star1's 15.5.

Wait, but distance is 5 pc, which is much closer than Star1's 10 pc. So maybe Star5 is actually bright enough.

So, looking back at the options, the correct pairs would have to be stars that have m <16.

Wait, perhaps I missed another star that can be observed by both.

Wait, Star5 is the only one. So the options must have Star5 as one of the pair.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → only Star5 fits.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → no.

Option B: Star3 can't be detected by either.

So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine Star3.

Star3 has an apparent magnitude of 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6.

So A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86.

So m_observed=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Which is above 17, so ESPRESSO can't detect it. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

So, the only star that can be detected by both is Star5.

But in the options, none have just Star5. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the apparent magnitude of Star3. Let me think again.

Wait, Star3: The description says apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, does that mean that the given apparent magnitude is already corrected for extinction? Or is it the intrinsic magnitude before extinction?

Ah, this is a critical point.

In astronomy, when a star's apparent magnitude is given, sometimes it's the observed (extincted) magnitude. But sometimes, especially when E(B-V) is given, the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic (without extinction). So I need to be careful.

Wait, the question states: for Star3, apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So that probably means that the apparent magnitude is already affected by extinction. Wait, no: the way the question is phrased, I think that the given m is the observed (i.e., after extinction) magnitude. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the way the question says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag." So I think that the apparent magnitude is the observed value after extinction. So in that case, the extinction would make the star appear even fainter. Wait, but that can't be, because extinction (dust) makes stars appear dimmer (higher magnitude), but if the given m is already after extinction, then adding more extinction would make it even higher. Or perhaps the given m is the intrinsic, and the extinction is what modifies it.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

In the standard approach, the observed (apparent) magnitude m is the sum of the intrinsic magnitude (if no extinction) plus the extinction A_V.

So m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

But sometimes, if a star's apparent magnitude is given without considering extinction, then you have to add A_V to get the observed magnitude.

But in the question, Star3's description says: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, and E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the 15.5 is the observed (apparent) magnitude, and the extinction is given. Or is the 15.5 the intrinsic, and the extinction is to be applied?

This is a crucial point because if 15.5 is the intrinsic, then the observed m =15.5 + A_V. But if it's the observed, then perhaps the E(B-V) is irrelevant for m, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, the question says: "Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." So A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V).

So for a star, if it's behind dust, its apparent magnitude is m = m_intrinsic + A_V.

So when the question gives a star's apparent magnitude, that's the observed (after extinction) magnitude. Wait, but that's not the usual case. Because usually, when you measure a star's magnitude, you're seeing it through extinction, so the observed m is higher.

So if the question gives Star3's apparent V magnitude as 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, then that implies that the star's true (intrinsic) m is lower (brighter) than 15.5. Because the extinction makes it appear dimmer.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Wait, let's clarify: the observed m is m = m_intrinsic + A_V.

So if a star has an intrinsic (unreddened) m of 15.5, and after adding A_V=1.86, the observed m becomes 17.36. But in the question, the given m for Star3 is 15.5. So that can't be, because it would imply that Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is brighter than the intrinsic m. That can't be. Because extinction makes it dimmer.

Wait, perhaps the given m is the intrinsic, and the observed m is higher. So for Star3, the intrinsic m is 15.5, but the observed m is 15.5 +1.86=17.36. So in that case, Star3's observed m is 17.36, not 15.5.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". So that must be the observed m. So I'm getting conflicting information.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is indicating that the apparent magnitude is after correcting for extinction. So m = m_observed - A_V. So Star3's m_observed is 15.5 (without extinction), but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent magnitude given already includes the extinction, so Star3's m is 15.5 as observed. But that would mean that the extinction doesn't affect the apparent magnitude, which doesn't make sense because extinction would make it dimmer.

This is confusing. Let me think again.

The standard approach is that the observed (apparent) magnitude is higher (fainter) than the intrinsic (unreddened) magnitude. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

So if the question gives a star's apparent magnitude (m_observed), and E(B-V), then you can compute A_V and find the intrinsic m. But that's not relevant for our case, because what matters is the observed m.

Wait, but in the case of Star3, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Ah, perhaps Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5 after considering extinction. Or is it before?

Wait, perhaps the question is structured so that the given m is the observed (apparent) magnitude, and the E(B-V) is to be used to compute the intrinsic magnitude. But that's not relevant because we only care about the observed m.

Wait, no. Because for the purposes of observation, what matters is the observed m. So if the star's observed m is 15.5, then it's within the limits.

Wait, in that case, Star3's m is 15.5, which is less than 16 and 17. So it can be observed by both. But wait, if the given m is the observed, then the E(B-V) would not affect it. But that doesn't make sense because E(B-V) is the cause of the extinction. So maybe I'm interpreting the question wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the given m is the intrinsic magnitude, and the extinction needs to be added to find the observed m.

So for Star3: M=15.5? No, no, no. Star3's description says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". So that's the observed m. So extinction is already accounted for in the observed m.

Wait, perhaps the given m is the observed (apparent) magnitude, so we don't need to add any extinction. Because the observed m already includes the effects of extinction.

Wait, that's possible. So in that case, Star3's m=15.5, which is less than 16 and 17. So it can be observed by both.

But then, what about Star4? Let's recalculate.

Star4: absolute V magnitude=15.5, distance=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4.

So, with M=15.5, d=10 pc, the apparent magnitude m is 15.5 +5 log10(10) =20.5. But with E(B-V)=0.4, the extinction A_V=3.1*0.4=1.24. So the observed m is 20.5 +1.24=21.74. But if the given m is the observed, then we don't need to add anything. So if the given m is 20.5 (intrinsic) plus 1.24 (extinction) gives observed m=21.74. But the question for Star4 says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5". Wait, no, wait. Star4's description says: "absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us."

Wait, no, Star4's description doesn't mention apparent magnitude. Wait, no:

Let me re-read the stars:

Star3: RA = 11h, DEC=48, apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, 15pc.

Star4: RA=85, DEC=-48, absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, 10 pc.

So Star4's description gives absolute magnitude, not apparent. So for Star4, we need to compute its apparent magnitude, then add extinction to find the observed m.

So Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc.

m = M +5 log10(10) =15.5 +5=20.5. Then, A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So observed m =20.5 +1.24=21.74. So Star4's m is 21.74, which is too faint for both.

Wait, but Star3's description says apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So if its apparent m is 15.5, that is after extinction. So in that case, the extinction doesn't affect the observed m; it's already accounted for. So Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both instruments' limits.

But this would mean that Star3 and Star5 can be observed by both.

So let me reevaluate:

If the given apparent magnitude already includes extinction (i.e., m is observed), then:

Star3's m=15.5 → can be detected by both.

Star5's m=15.0 → can be detected by both.

So which stars have m <16 and <17.

So both Star3 and Star5 would be detectable by both instruments.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Star3's m was 17.36 because I added extinction. But if the given m is already the observed (after extinction), then there's no need to add anything.

Wait, this is a crucial point that I may have misunderstood.

The key is whether the given apparent magnitude is the observed (corrected for extinction) or the intrinsic (unreddened) magnitude.

In the case of Star3, if the apparent magnitude is after correcting for extinction, then E(B-V) is not needed to calculate it. Because the m given is already the observed value.

But in the case of Star4, which gives absolute magnitude and E(B-V), you have to compute the apparent magnitude and add the extinction.

So let me re-approach each star, considering that some have m given as observed, others need calculation.

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc.

m =15.5 +5=20.5 (apparent, no extinction, since no E(B-V)).

So m=20.5. Fainter than both, so can't be observed.

Star2: m=16.5 (apparent), no E(B-V). So m=16.5. Fainter than HIRES (needs <16), so can't be observed by HIRES.

Star3: m=15.5 (apparent), E(B-V)=0.6. Since apparent is already observed, it's 15.5, so can be observed by both.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc. Compute m=20.5 (apparent). E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=1.24. So observed m=20.5+1.24=21.74. So too faint.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc. Compute m=15.0 (apparent), E(B-V)=0 (since not mentioned). So m=15.0, can be observed by both.

So now, both Star3 and Star5 have m <16 and <17. So they can be observed by both instruments.

Looking at the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5.

So the correct answer is B.

But wait, earlier I thought that Star3's m was 17.36 because I added extinction to an intrinsic m of 15.5. But if the given m is 15.5 already observed, then no need to add. So the confusion arises from whether the given m is intrinsic or observed.

The question says, for Star3, apparent V mag is 15.5. So that's the observed, which already includes extinction. So in that case, Star3's m is 15.5, which is acceptable for both.

So the answer would be Star3 and Star5.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5.

So the answer is B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m_V < 17$), while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m_V < 16$). Therefore, a star must have $m_V < 16$ to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**:
- Absolute magnitude $M = 15.5$, distance $d = 10$ pc, no extinction mentioned.
- Apparent magnitude:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) = 15.5 + 5 = 20.5
  \]
- $m = 20.5$ is fainter than both $m < 17$ and $m < 16$, so it cannot be detected by either instrument.

#### **Star2**:
- Apparent magnitude $m = 16.5$, no extinction mentioned.
- $m = 16.5$ is fainter than $m < 16$ (HIRES limit) but brighter than $m < 17$ (ESPRESSO limit).  
- It can only be detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

#### **Star3**:
- Apparent magnitude $m = 15.5$, extinction $E(B-V) = 0.6$.  
- The total absorption in the V band is $A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86$.  
- Since the apparent magnitude is already given as the observed (extincted) magnitude, no further correction is needed.  
- $m = 15.5$ satisfies both $m < 17$ and $m < 16$, so it can be detected by both instruments.

#### **Star4**:
- Absolute magnitude $M = 15.5$, distance $d = 10$ pc, extinction $E(B-V) = 0.4$.  
- Apparent magnitude:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) = 15.5 + 5 = 20.5
  \]
- Total absorption $A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24$.  
- Observed magnitude:  
  \[
  m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 20.5 + 1.24 = 21.74
  \]
- $m_{\text{observed}} = 21.74$ is fainter than both $m < 17$ and $m < 16$, so it cannot be detected by either instrument.

#### **Star5**:
- Absolute magnitude $M = 16.5$, distance $d = 5$ pc, no extinction mentioned.  
- Apparent magnitude:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5) \approx 16.5 + 3.49 = 19.99
  \]
- Since no extinction is mentioned, $m = 19.99$ is used as the observed magnitude.  
- $m = 19.99$ is fainter than both $m < 17$ and $m < 16$, so it cannot be detected by either instrument.

### Conclusion:
- **Star3** has $m = 15.5$, which satisfies both $m < 17$ and $m < 16$, making it detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.  
- **Star5** has $m = 15.0$, which also satisfies both $m < 17$ and $m < 16$, making it detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.  
- Therefore, the stars that can be detected by both instruments are **Star3 and Star5**.
