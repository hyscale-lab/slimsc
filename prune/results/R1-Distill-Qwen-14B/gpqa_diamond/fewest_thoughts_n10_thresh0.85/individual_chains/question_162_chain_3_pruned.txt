Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about finding the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me think this through.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a two-dimensional metric in terms of x and y coordinates. But wait, pseudospheres are surfaces in three dimensions, right? Or maybe this is a different context. Oh, wait, maybe this is a metric in conformal form because it's expressed as a function times (dx² + dy²). Conformal metrics are nice because they preserve angles locally.

I remember that the area element in a two-dimensional metric is calculated using the determinant of the metric tensor. For a metric like ds² = E dx² + 2F dxdy + G dy², the area element is sqrt(EG - F²) dx dy. But in this case, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²), so E and G are both 32/(4 - x² - y²), and F is zero because there's no cross term. So the determinant would be EG - F² = E*G = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

Wait, no, actually, the area element is the square root of the determinant, right? So sqrt(EG - F²) = sqrt( [32/(4 - x² - y²)]² ) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm. Pseudosphere... Oh, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric given might be representing such a surface.

Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the metric for a pseudosphere can be written in terms of a parameter, maybe like Poincaré coordinates. Let me recall. The Poincaré disk model for hyperbolic space has a metric like (4/(1 - x² - y²)^2)(dx² + dy²). Wait, but our metric here is 32/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). That looks similar but not exactly the same.

Wait, another thought: maybe the metric is scaled. Let's see,
