Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula is N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance, r. The options are A through D, each giving a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, the formula for distance in parsecs is distance (d) equals 1 divided by parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes. So if parallax increases, the star is closer, and if parallax decreases, the star is farther away.

The problem gives the number of stars as inversely proportional to plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But I need to express this in terms of distance, since the question is about how N changes with r (distance). 

Since d = 1/plx, I can rearrange this to get plx = 1/d. Let's substitute that into the equation for N. So N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's simplify that.

(1/(1/d))^5 is the same as d^5. So 1 divided by (1/d)^5 is d^5. Therefore, N is proportional to d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So that's the derivative of N with respect to d, right? Because per unit distance, how much does N change.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then the rate of change (dN/dr) is proportional to 5d^4. But wait, the options don't have 5, so perhaps the question is just asking about the trend, not the exact coefficient.

Wait, no, the question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"—so it's about the density of stars as a function of distance. So maybe it's directly asking about N as a function of d.

Wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. It says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for a given region, when
