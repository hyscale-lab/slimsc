Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, let's break down each piece of data given and see what we can deduce.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait—carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300. But sometimes, other O-H groups like in phenols or maybe even ketones (though those usually don't show O-H). Hmm, but a broad peak here is probably from an O-H group.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak is a bit lower. Maybe that's from conjugated carbonyls or maybe an aromatic ring with some substituent, like a carbonyl in a ring or something else. Oh wait, if there's a conjugated double bond, like in an enone system, the carbonyl peak would be lower. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group attached. Alternatively, that 1650 could be from an aromatic C=C stretching. Let me think—benzene rings usually have absorption around 1600-1450, but if there's a substituent with a double bond, like a vinyl group, maybe that's where it comes in. But in the NMR, they mentioned peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, so there's likely a double bond somewhere, maybe a vinyl group or something like that.

So combining the FTIR data: O-H (broad peak), and two carbonyls maybe? Or perhaps one carbonyl and another group. Wait, 1700 is a strong carbonyl, and 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Wait, another thought: if the compound has both a carbonyl and an aromatic ring, maybe the 1650 is the aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Or it could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl (enone), which would lower the carbonyl peak, but then what about the 1700 one? Hmm.

Wait, if the compound has two carbonyl groups, that would mean two peaks. But that seems a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe one carbonyl group and another functional group.

Wait, looking at the options to see their possible functional groups. Let's think about each option's possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be something with two oxygen-containing groups, like an ester, maybe. Or a diol with a ketone, but that would be a lot of oxygens. Alternatively, a cyclic ester like a lactone. Or perhaps a molecule with both an ester and a hydroxyl group.

Option B: C6H10O. That would be a molecule with one oxygen. Could be an alcohol, ether, aldehyde, ketone, or maybe an ester? No, esters have two oxygen atoms. So for C6H10O, it's one oxygen. Maybe it's a ketone, like cyclohexanone? But then the IR would show a strong peak around 1700, which matches. But then the broad peak at 3000 would probably not be present because ketones don't have O-H. Unless it's a cyclic ketone with some other group. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two oxygen atoms. Possible structures: ester, carboxylic acid, ketone plus an alcohol, maybe a lactone, or an acyclic ester. Also, maybe a cyclic hemiacetal or something. But let's see.

Option D: C6H12O. One oxygen. Maybe an alcohol, ether, or a ketone.

Wait, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group. So, the compound must have either an alcohol, phenol, or carboxylic acid group. Let's see which options have that.

Looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2: Could have two O-containing groups, maybe a diol, or ester (like O and another O).

B) C6H10O: One O. So if it's an alcohol, then O-H would be present, but the O count is one.

C) C6H10O2: Two O's. Maybe ester (like O and O), so the O-H would come from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but esters don't have O-H groups. Wait, wait: esters have an O in the carbonyl and an O in the ether part. So an ester's structure is R-O-CO-R. So no O-H in the ester. But if the compound has an ester and an alcohol group, that would make O2. Or maybe a carboxylic acid and an ether, but that's less likely.

Wait, the O-H in the FTIR is broad, so that's probably from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Suppose it's a carboxylic acid. Then, the O2 would make sense because a carboxylic acid has two O's in the -COOH group. So that would fit option C or A.

But let's think about the other peaks. The 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700, right? So that would match. The 1650 could be from something else. Wait, but if it's a conjugated double bond or an aromatic ring.

The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So there's a double bond somewhere. Maybe an aromatic ring, but vinyl would be a CH2=CH group. Or a substituted double bond.

So, putting that together, the compound might have a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid) and a vinyl group or an aromatic ring.

Wait,
