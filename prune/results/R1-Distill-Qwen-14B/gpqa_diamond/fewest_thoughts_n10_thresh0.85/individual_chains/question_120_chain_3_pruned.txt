Alright, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. And the options are A to D, each with different power dependencies on plx.

Hmm, okay. Let me think. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance d in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax plx, so d = 1/plx. So, as parallax decreases, the distance increases.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, if I have a certain range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Stars are assumed to be uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? I think it's probably uniform in terms of distance, but wait, I'm not so sure. Wait, no, wait. The problem says uniform distribution in the sky. But in reality, the distribution of stars isn't uniform in all directions. Oh wait no, the question states to assume stars are uniformly distributed. So maybe the number density of stars is the same throughout space. Like, the same number per unit volume everywhere.

So, if we think in terms of volume, the number of stars in a given volume would be proportional to that volume. But when considering distance, the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)π r³, so the shell's volume is the difference between two spheres, which gives 4π d² dr.

But wait, how does this relate to parallax? Since plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, dr would be the change in distance, which we can relate to dplx, the change in parallax.

Let me think about that. If d = 1/plx, then dr = -1/(plx²) dplx. Wait, because plx is in arcseconds, and the derivative of d with respect to plx is -1/(plx²). So, dr = -(1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, but when you're looking at a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distance range is from d to d + dr. But since d = 1/plx, and plx is decreasing as d increases,
