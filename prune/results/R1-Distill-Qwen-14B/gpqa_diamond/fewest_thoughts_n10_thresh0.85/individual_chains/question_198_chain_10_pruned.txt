Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to figure it out step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. And the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, so first, I need to understand what the different β values correspond to. Stability constants, right? Each β represents the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)2]^0, β3 is [Co(SCN)3]^- , and β4 is [Co(SCN)4]^2-? Or wait, maybe the order is different. Let me think: the stability constant βn is for the nth complex. So each step adds SCN-.

Wait, the general formula for the formation of a complex is Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n). So the first complex would be [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), then [Co(SCN)_2] (0 charge), [Co(SCN)_3]^- and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-. Each β corresponds to the successive addition of SCN^-.

So the given β's are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, so the first complex is [CoSCN]^+, then the second adds another SCN-, the third another, and the fourth another.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Oh, right, dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands. So the [Co(SCN)2]^0 complex is the blue one. So we need to find the fraction of all Co species that are in this second complex.

So to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)2]^0, I need to calculate the distribution of Co among all possible complexes and free Co^2+.

The approach is to find the fractions of each complex and free Co^2+ based on the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN- and Co. 

The formula for the fraction f_n of each complex is given by the product of the β's up to that point, multiplied by [SCN]^n, divided by the sum of all such terms including the free Co^2+.

Wait, let me think. The general expression is that the fraction f_n is equal to (β1 * β2 * ... * βn * [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + ... )

But wait, I'm not sure if I'm remembering that correctly. Another approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, each with their own stability constants. So the formation of each complex is a stepwise process, where each β is the equilibrium constant for adding one more SCN-.

Wait, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) would be the product of the first n β's. So for n=2, it's β1 * β2.

But when calculating the fractions, it's easier to think in terms of the stepwise formation. So the fraction of each species is determined by the product of β's up to that species multiplied by [SCN]^n, divided by the sum of all such terms for n=0 (free Co^2+) to n=4.

Wait, let me get this straight. The formula for the fraction of the nth complex is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n ) / D,

where D is the sum over all possible species (including n=0, which is free Co^2+).

But wait, for n=0, it's just 1; for n=1, it's β1 [SCN]; for n=2, it's β1 β2 [SCN]^2, and so on. So D is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each β is the stepwise constant, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) is the product of the first n β's. So yes, the denominator D is the sum for n=0 to 4 of the product up to that n multiplied by [SCN]^n.

Wait, no, actually, the denominator is the sum for each possible complex, including the free ion. So for each n from 0 to 4, the term is the product of the first n β constants multiplied by [SCN]^n. So for n=0, it's 1 (free Co^2+), for n=1, it's β1 [SCN], for n=2, β1 β2 [SCN]^2, etc.

So the denominator D is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

Yes, that makes sense. So we can compute each term in D, sum them, then the fraction f_n is (product of β up to n) * [SCN]^n divided by D.

But wait, also, the overall concentration of Co is given as 1e-2 M. Hmm, but in the denominator, the terms are just the products and [SCN]^n, but I think the actual concentration is considered in the [Co] term, which is included in the fractions. Wait, maybe my approach is correct because the fractions f_n are normalized such that their sum is 1, considering all possible species.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the total concentration of Co:

[Co] = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-]

Which is the sum of all the species. So when calculating the fractions, each species' concentration is their respective term, and the denominator is the sum of all these.

But in any case, the fraction of the n=2 complex is [Co(SCN)_2] divided by the total [Co].

So, the plan is:

1. Compute each term in the denominator D. Each term is the product of the first n β's multiplied by [SCN]^n. For n=0 to 4.

Wait, but n=0 is just 1, n=1 is β1* [SCN], n=2 is β1*β2* [SCN]^2, n=3 is β1*β2*β3 * [SCN]^3, and n=4 is β1*β2*β3*β4 * [SCN]^4.

So let's compute each term.

Given that [SCN] is 0.1 M.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each term:

n=0: 1

n=1: β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

n=2: β1*β2 * (0.1)^2 = 9 * 40 * 0.01 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

n=3: β1*β2*β3 * (0.1)^3 = 9*40*63 * 0.001 = 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68

n=4: β1*β2*β3*β4 * (0.1)^4 = 9*40*63*16 * 0.0001

Let's compute that:

9 *40=360, 360 *63=22680, 22680 *16= 362880. Then multiply by 0.0001: 36.288.

Wait, but wait: 9 *40 = 360. 360 *63 = 22680. 22680 *16 = 362,880. Then 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So term n=4 is 36.288.

Now, let's list all terms:

n=0: 1

n=1: 0.9

n=2: 3.6

n=3: 22.68

n=4: 36.288

Now sum all these terms for D:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Now, the fraction f_2 is the term for n=2 divided by D.

f_2 = 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ let's compute that.

3.6 divided by 64.468 is approximately 0.05557.

But wait, 3.6 /64.468.

Hmm, 64.468 divided by 3.6 is about 17.907, so 1/17.907 ≈ 0.0558. So 3.6/64.468 ≈ 0.0556, or about 5.56%.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the stability constants can be for different charge complexes, but that shouldn't matter for the fractions. Or perhaps I got the stability constants wrong.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the β values are given in a different order. Maybe the first β is for [Co(SCN)]^2+? No, that can't be right because β1 is 9, which is smaller than β2 and β3, which are higher.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is the third complex, not the second. Wait, no, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, which is n=2.

Wait, the possible mistake might be in the calculation of the terms. Let me double-check each term.

n=0: 1. Correct.

n=1: 9 *0.1=0.9. Correct.

n=2: 9*40=360. 360 * (0.1)^2=0.01. 360 *0.01=3.6. Correct.

n=3: 9*40=360; 360 *63=22680. 22680 * (0.1)^3=0.001. 22680 *0.001=22.68. Correct.

n=4: 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16=362880. 362880* (0.1)^4=0.0001. 362880 *0.0001=36.288. Correct.

So D =1 +0.9 +3.6 + 22.68 +36.288= 1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9+3.6=5.5; 5.5+22.68=28.18; 28.18+36.288
