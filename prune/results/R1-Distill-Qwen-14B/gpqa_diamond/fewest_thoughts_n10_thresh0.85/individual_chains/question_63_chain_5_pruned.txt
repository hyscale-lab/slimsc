Okay, so I've got this question about quantum mechanics and diatomic molecules. Hmm, let me see. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, because in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, hence considering vibrational energy as well.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so both the rotational and vibrational parts are in their lowest energy levels. I think the rotational part is the spin about the bond axis, and the vibrational is the stretching.

The question is asking what momentum a photon should have so the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, so the molecule absorbs a photon, and this causes a transition. Since it's the next lowest state, I guess that's the first excited state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on whether this transition is purely rotational, purely vibrational, or both.

Wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are actually a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. So the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0). To go to the next lowest energy state, perhaps it's the next vibrational state (v=1) and same or next rotational state.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule transitions to the next energy state, which could be a higher rotational state within the same vibrational level. But I think in this question, they're considering a single photon absorption that causes a transition to the next possible state, which could involve both rotational and vibrational changes.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, wait, the next state after the fundamental state would be the first excited state. So, what defines the energy levels in this model? The energy levels are quantized and given by the sum of rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are given by the equation E = (some constants) * (J)(J+1) + (v + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the frequency. So the fundamental state is J=0 and v=0. The next state could be either increasing J by one, but in that case, the rotational energy would go from 0 (J=0) to J=1, giving some energy. Alternatively, the vibrational state could increase from v=0 to v=1, which is a much larger energy jump.

But I'm a bit confused about the possible transitions. If the molecule is in its fundamental state (J=0, v=0), the next state with the lowest possible energy would have the smallest possible increase in energy. So, perhaps it's the first rotational state (J=1) and same vibrational state (v=0), or the same rotational state (J=0) and first vibrational state (v=1).

Wait, but the energy of the vibrational state is much higher. For example, if the rotational energy for J=0 is zero, and for J=1, it's something like (1)(2) * something. The vibrational energy for v=1 is (1 + ½) h ν, which is much bigger than the rotational energy. So if the molecule is in the fundamental state (J=0, v=0), the next possible state with the least energy would be J=1, v=0. Because that's a smaller energy increase than going to v=1.

But wait, the question says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe the next state is the one that requires the least energy, which would be the J=1, v=0 state. So the photon's energy would correspond to the difference between those two states.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the molecule can absorb a photon that allows it to move to the next higher vibrational state, which would require a much higher energy. But the problem is phrased as the lowest possible energy, so the photon's energy would be the smallest needed to transition to the next state.

Wait, but if the molecule is in its fundamental state, the next possible state with the lowest energy would be the next rotational state, not the vibrational. Because the vibrational energy is higher. So the photon would have to supply the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the energy levels. The total energy is E = E_rot + E_vib. E_rot is (ħ² / 2I) * J (J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. E_vib is (v + ½) h ν.

In the fundamental state, J=0, v=0: E = 0 + ½ h ν.

If the molecule transitions to J=1, v=0: E = (1 * 2) (ħ²/(2I)) ) + ½ h ν.

The energy difference would be (2 ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I) * (1) because 2 divided by 2 is 1.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate.

E_rot for J=0 is 0. For J=1, E_rot is (ħ²/(2I)) * (1)(2) = ħ²/(2I) * 2 = ħ²/I.

So the energy difference when going from J=0 to J=1 is ħ²/(I) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

But wait, I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

So first, compute μ.

Given:

Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu.

Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) in amu. So:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (1.818) * 1.6605e-27 ≈ approx 3.012e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

20/11 = approximately 1.81818.

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute:

1.81818 * 1.6605 = let's see:

1 * 1.6605 = 1.6605

0.81818 *1.6605 ≈ approx 0.818 *1.66 = (0.8 *1.66)=1.328, plus (0.018 *1.66)=0.030 -> approx 1.358.

Adding 1.6605 and 1.358: 3.0185.

So μ ≈ 3.0185e-27 kg.

Wait, but 20/11 is exactly 1.8181818... So 1.8181818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

Wait, 1.8181818 * 1.6605 = let's compute exactly.

Compute 1.8181818 * 1.6605:

1 * 1.6605 = 1.6605.

0.8181818 * 1.6605 = ?

Let me compute 0.8 * 1.6605 = 1.3284.

0.0181818 * 1.6605 = approx 0.0299999.

So total 1.3284 + 0.0299999 ≈ 1.3584.

So total μ = (1.6605 + 1.3584) × 1e-27 kg? Wait no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake. Because 1.8181818 is 1 + 0.8181818. So when I multiply 1.8181818 by 1.6605, it's 1 * 1.6605 plus 0.8181818 * 1.6605.

Which is 1.6605 + (approx 1.3584) = 3.0189.

So μ ≈ 3.0189e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = (3.0189e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Compute (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.0189e-27 *4e-20 = 1.20756e-46 kg·m².

Now, the difference in rotational energy when J increases from 0 to 1 is E = ħ²/(2I) * J(J+1) for J=1, minus J=0.

Wait, the energy levels for rotation are E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * J (J+1).

So E_rot (J=0) =0, E_rot (J=1) = ħ²/(2I) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

The energy difference ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

But wait, I think I made a mistake. Because ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is h/(2π). So I should compute ΔE_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * (1)(2) ) - 0 = (ħ² *2 )/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So, let's compute ħ²/(I).

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.112e-68) (J²s²). Wait, better to compute it exactly.

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 × 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²s².

Then, ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 J²s² / 1.20756e-46 kg m².

Wait, units: J is kg m²/s². So J² is kg² m^4/s^4.

So ħ² has units (J s)^2 = (kg m²/s² * s)^2 = (kg m²/s)^2. So kg² m^4 / s².

Then, I is kg m². So when you divide ħ² by I, the units are (kg² m^4 / s² ) / (kg m²) )= kg m² / s² = J.

So the energy is in joules.

So compute 1.112e-68 / 1.20756e-46.

1.112e-68 /1.20756e-46 = (1.112/1.20756) * 1e-22 ≈ approximately 0.921 * 1e-22 = 9.21e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, the energy of the photon must match this ΔE to cause the transition from J=0 to J=1.

The momentum p of the photon is related to its energy by E_photon = p c, where c is the speed of light.

So p = E_photon / c = ΔE_rot / c.

ΔE_rot is 9.21e-23 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s. Because 1 N·s is 1 kg·m/s.

So 3.07e-31 N·s is way smaller than any of the options given (which are all around 1e-28). So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's go back.

Wait, perhaps the transition is not just a rotational transition but also involves a vibrational state. Because the question includes the angular frequency of vibration, w=4e14 rad/s.

Wait, but in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination. So the next state after (J=0, v=0) would not just be (J=1, v=0) but perhaps (J=0, v=1), which would have a higher energy. But the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lower energy transition would be (J=1, v=0), but that's what I calculated earlier, leading to a photon momentum of ~3e-31 Ns, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering just the vibrational transition. Because if the question is about the next state, regardless of which part (rotation or vibration), then the vibrational transition would require a much higher energy.

Wait, the vibrational energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h ν. Since the angular frequency w is given, and ν = w/(2π) ≈ w, but in this case, w is 4e14 rad/s. So ν is approximately 4e14 / (2π) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So the energy difference h ν is h * 6.366e13 Hz.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So E_vib = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.21e-20 J.

Then, the photon's energy would be 4.21e-20 J. The momentum p = E/c = 4.21e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.403e-28 kg m/s, which is 1.403e-28 N·s because 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches this.

But wait, why would the molecule absorb a photon that causes a vibrational transition instead of a rotational one? Because the rotational transition requires less energy, but perhaps the model is considering transitions where both rotation and vibration change. Or perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition, but I thought the energy for that was higher.

Wait, the options are for the photon's momentum. The rotational transition's p was about 3e-31, which is much smaller than any option. The vibrational transition's p is about 1.4e-28, which is option D.

But why would the molecule need to go to the next state with the lowest possible energy? Because the vibrational state would have higher energy than the rotational, but perhaps the question is about the next energy level, which could be either.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the next state could be either the first rotational state (J=1, v=0) or the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0). Which one has lower energy? Let's compute their energies.

E_1 for J=1, v=0: E_rot = ħ²/(I) as before. And E_vib is (0 + ½) h ν.

Wait, no. E_rot for J=1 is (1)(2) * (ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I). E_vib is (0 + ½) h ν.

So E_J1_v0 = ħ²/(I) + (½) h ν.

Wait, no, no. Because when v=0, the vibrational energy is (0 + ½) h ν, which is ½ h ν. The rotational part for J=1 is ħ²/(I).

Wait, but the total energy in the J=0, v=0 state is E0 = ½ h ν.

In the J=1, v=0 state, E1 = ħ²/(I) + ½ h ν.

In the J=0, v=1 state, E2 = 0 + (1 + ½) h ν = (3/2) h ν.

So E1 is ½ h ν + ħ²/(I), and E2 is 3/2 h ν.

Which is lower? That depends on the value of ħ²/(I) compared to h ν.

Wait, let's compute ħ²/(I) and h ν.

Earlier, ħ²/(I) was approx 9.21e-23 J.

h ν is 6.626e-34 J·s * 6.366e13 Hz = 6.626e-34 *6.366e13 = approx 4.21e-20 J.

So 9.21e-23 J is much smaller than 4.21e-20 J. So E1 = 9.21e-23 + 2.105e-20 (since ½ h ν is (6.626e-34 * 6.366e13)/2 = (4.21e-20)/2 = 2.105e-20 J).

Wait, let me compute ½ h ν: ½ *4.21e-20 = 2.105e-20 J.

So E1 = 2.105e-20 + 9.21e-23 ≈ 2.114e-20 J.

E2 is 3/2 h ν = 6.315e-20 J.

So E1 is about 2.11e-20 J, E2 is 6.315e-20 J. So E1 is lower than E2.

Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy is E1 (J=1, v=0). So the energy difference would be E1 - E0 = (2.114e-20) - (2.105e-20) = approx 9.2e-23 J, which is the same as the rotational energy difference, which makes sense because E0 is v=0, J=0: ½ h ν.

Wait, no, wait. In the J=0, v=0 state, E0 = ½ h ν.

In J=1, v=0, E1 = ½ h ν + (ħ²/(I)).

So the difference is ħ²/(I), same as before. So the energy required is 9.2e-23 J, which as before leads to a photon momentum of 3e-31 kg m/s, which is way off from the options.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because the options are all around 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns, which is about 1e-27 kg m/s. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, ignoring rotation. But in that case, the energy difference is h ν, and p = h ν / c.

Wait, but earlier, E_vib for v=1 is 3/2 h ν. E0 is ½ h ν. So the energy difference is h ν. So in that case, E_photon = h ν.

Wait, no, E_vib for v=1 is (1 + ½) h ν = 3/2 h ν. The ground state is v=0, E= ½ h ν. So the energy difference is (3/2 - ½) h ν = h ν.

So E_photon = h ν = 6.626e-34 J·s * 6.366e13 Hz ≈ 4.21e-20 J.

Then p = E/c = 4.21e-20 J / 3e8 m/s = 1.403e-28 kg m/s = 1.403e-28 N·s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

So that would be the correct answer. But why is the rotation not considered? Because the question states that the molecule is in the fundamental state (J=0, v=0), and the next state with the lowest possible energy is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0), because any rotational transition would require less energy, but perhaps when the model is considering the non-rigid rotor, the energy levels are a combination, and perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that E1 (J=1, v=0) is about 2.11e-20 J, and E2 (J=0, v=1) is 6.315e-20 J. So E1 is lower than E2. So E1 would be the next state after E0. So why is the photon's momentum not matching any option?

Wait, maybe the question is considering a transition to the next state which is the first state above the ground state, regardless of J and v. But based on the energies calculated, E1 is lower than E2, so E1 is the next state.

But according to that, the photon's momentum is 3e-31 Ns, which is not an option. So perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule to transition to the next state, which is the first vibrational level, not considering rotational transitions, perhaps under the assumption that the rotational transitions are not allowed or are much less probable, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy change for rotation is much smaller, but the question is about the photon's momentum, which is on the scale of 1e-28 Ns. So maybe the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition, leading to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0), ignoring rotational transitions because maybe the rotational energy is negligible compared to the vibrational energy.

Let's think about the numbers. Earlier, the rotational energy difference was 9.2e-
