Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says we have a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, stochiometric usually means the molar ratio is 1:1, right? So the complex is CaY^2-, where Y is EDTA. The pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard conditions, so no worries about that affecting the K value.

The K value given is 5x10^10. I think K here is the formation constant, Kf, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but wait. The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. So the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-, but in a very small amount because Kf is large, meaning the complex is stable.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M of the complex. So initially, all the Ca is tied up in the complex, but some will dissociate. But since Kf is so large (1e10 is big, 5e10 even bigger), the dissociation is minimal. So the [Ca^2+] should be very small.

Let me set up the equation. Let's let the concentration of the complex be 0.02 M initially. Let x be the amount that dissociates. So:

At equilibrium:
[C CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small)
[Ca^2+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

Because for every mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole each of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

So the Kf expression is (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So 0.02/(x²) =5e10.

Wait, solving for x²: x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-13.

Wait wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 => 4e-13.

So x squared is 4e-13, which makes x the square root of that. Square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4)=2, and sqrt(10^-13) is 10^(-6.5). Wait, 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 1e-7, so 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7.

Wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M. So [Ca^2+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me redo the math.

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] )

Given Kf =5e10.

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately 0.02, because x is so small.

So 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2 ) → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 =4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5= 2 * 3.16e-7 =6.32e-7.

Yes, that's correct. So the concentration is about 6.3e-7 M. So option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation equilibrium is represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of calcium ions that dissociate from the complex. At equilibrium:
- \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since \( x \) is small),
- \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = x\),
- \([ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ] = x\).

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]}{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ]}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

The correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
