Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants have something to do with the stability of complexes; the higher the constant, the more stable the complex is.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are provided for four different complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

The main question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The options are A to D, but I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I think the blue complex is probably the one with two SCN- ions. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands. So, I'm guessing that's either the Co(SCN)2^2+ complex. Let me think: the complexes would be CoSCN+, Co(SCN)2^2+, Co(SCN)3^+, and Co(SCN)4^2-? Or maybe the charges are different. Oh wait, for cobalt(II), the charge is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So for each complex:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ → +2 + (-1) = +1. So β1 would be for the first complex.
- [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) → +2 + 2*(-1) = 0? No, wait, wait. Wait, no: Co is +2, each SCN- is -1. So if you have two SCN-, the total charge would be +2 -2 = 0? But that can't be because the solution is in water, which is neutral. Maybe I got the complexes wrong. Wait, perhaps the complexes are all positively charged, so maybe each has a certain number of SCN- to balance the charge.

Alternatively, perhaps each βn corresponds to the complex with n SCN- ligands. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Hmm, that doesn't seem to make sense because neutral complexes would precipitate or something. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are all with +2 charge. Wait, Co is +2, so each complex would have Co plus some SCN- and possibly other counterions. Alternatively, maybe the stability constants are for the step-wise formation, like each β is for adding another SCN-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The stability constant for a complex is given by the formula:

βn = [Co(SCN)_n]/[Co(SCN)_{n-1}] [SCN^-]

So for each step, adding another SCN- to form the next complex. So β1 is for the first addition, β2 the second, etc.

So the overall formation constant for the complex with n SCN- would be the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, that sounds right. So the overall β for the complex with 2 SCN- would be β1 * β2. For 3, it's β1β2β3, and so on.

So the problem is about finding the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the one with two SCN- ions. So we need to find the fraction of Co present as [Co(SCN)_2]^something.

Wait, but Co has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So for the complex [Co(SCN)_2], the charge would be +2 - 2 = 0. Hmm, that's a neutral complex. But how does that work in solution? Maybe it's actually [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the complexes are all in a certain charge. Let me think again. Let's say for each complex, the charge is +2 - n, where n is the number of SCN- ions. So [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3), and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (n=4). Oh, okay, that makes sense. So the four complexes have different charges, and the stability constants are given for each step.

So, the problem is to find the fraction of all Co species that are in the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, which is the blue dithiocyanato one.

So to find this, I think I need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex (n=0,1,2,3,4) and then find the percentage for n=2.

But wait, the initial Co concentration is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. So the solution is not at infinite dilution, so the ligand isn't in excess. Or is it? Hmm.

Wait, the Co is 0.01 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. So SCN is in higher concentration than Co. So I think the complexes will form, but the exact distribution depends on the stability constants.

So, the approach is to calculate the concentration of each possible complex (from n=0 to n=4) and find the fraction that's in the n=2 state.

Each complex can be represented as [Co(SCN)_n]^{(charge)}, and the formation of each is governed by the stability constants.

The general approach is to use the formation constants and the given concentrations to find the distribution of the complex species.

Alternatively, since the problem gives the stability constants as stepwise, perhaps we can use the stepwise approach.

Wait, the stability constant for each step is given as βn = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co(SCN)_{n-1}} [SCN^-])

So for n=1, β1=9 → [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+] [SCN^-]) = 9

n=2, β2=40 → [Co(SCN)_2^0]/([CoSCN+] [SCN^-}) =40

n=3, β3=63 → [Co(SCN)_3^-]/([Co(SCN)_2^0} [SCN^-})=63

n=4, β4=16 → [Co(SCN)_4^2-]/([Co(SCN)_3^-} [SCN^-})=16

So, the overall formation constants for each complex would be the product of the stepwise β's up to that n.

For example, the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be β1 * β2 = 9 *40 = 360.

Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_3]^-, it's β1β2β3=9*40*63 = let's compute that. 9*40 is 360, *63 is 22680.

And for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, the Kf is 9*40*63*16.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to compute all of them. Instead, I can model the distribution of the species using these stepwise constants and the given concentrations.

So, the distribution of Co species can be modeled using the stepwise log K values, but perhaps using the stability constants in their given form.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider all possible species and their concentrations, then find the fraction of each.

The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So, the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n] species should equal 1e-2 M.

But wait, the initial Co is in solution as Co^2+ and then forms complexes with SCN-.

So, the initial Co^2+ can form [CoSCN+] (n=1), [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), etc.

Let me denote the concentration of Co in each complex as [Co_n], where n is the number of SCN- attached.

Then, the total concentration is:

[Co] = [Co_0] + [Co_1] + [Co_2] + [Co_3] + [Co_4] = 1e-2 M.

The [Co_0] is the concentration of free Co^2+.

The [Co_1] is the concentration of [CoSCN+]^+.

Similarly, [Co_2] is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, but [Co_2] is neutral, so perhaps it's less soluble, but I think in solution, it's present.

But regardless, the approach is to express each [Co_n] in terms of [Co_0] and the stability constants.

Let me think: for each step, [Co_n] can be related to [Co_{n-1}] and [SCN^-].

Using the definitions of the stability constants:

[Co_1] = β1 * [Co_0] [SCN^-]

[Co_2] = β2 * [Co_1] [SCN^-] = β1 β2 [Co_0] [SCN^-]^2

Similarly,

[Co_3] = β3 * [Co_2] [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 [Co_0] [SCN^-]^3

[Co_4] = β4 * [Co_3] [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co_0] [SCN^-]^4

So, all [Co_n] can be expressed in terms of [Co_0] and [SCN^-].

So, the total [Co] is:

[Co_0] + [Co_1] + [Co_2] + [Co_3] + [Co_4] = 1e-2.

Substituting each [Co_n]:

[Co_0] + β1 [Co_0] [S] + β1 β2 [Co_0] [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [Co_0] [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co_0] [S]^4 = 1e-2.

Where [S] is the concentration of SCN^-.

We have [S] = 0.1 M.

So, substituting the values:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So, let's compute each term:

Term1: [Co_0]

Term2: 9 * [Co_0] *0.1 → 0.9 [Co_0]

Term3: 9*40 * [Co_0]*(0.1)^2 → 360 * [Co_0] * 0.01 → 3.6 [Co_0]

Term4: 9*40*63 * [Co_0]*(0.1)^3 → 22680 * [Co_0] * 0.001 → 22.68 [Co_0]

Term5: 9*40*63*16 * [Co_0]*(0.1)^4 → compute it:

9 *40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

Multiply by [Co_0]*(0.1)^4=1e-4 → 362880 *1e-4 = 36.288.

So term5: 36.288 [Co_0]

So, putting all terms together:

[Co_0] + 0.9 [Co_0] + 3.6 [Co_0] +22.68 [Co_0] +36.288 [Co_0] =1e-2.

Add all coefficients:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So, 64.468 [Co_0] = 1e-2.

Solving for [Co_0]:

[Co_0] = (1e-2)/64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Now, let's compute each [Co_n]:

[Co_0] ≈ 1.551e-4 M

[Co_1] = β1 [Co_0] [S] =9 *1.551e-4 *0.1 → 9*1.551e-5 =1.3959e-4 M.

Wait, no: 9 * 1.551e-4 is 1.3959e-3, multiplied by 0.1 is 1.3959e-4 M.

Wait, no: 1.551e-4 *0.1=1.551e-5. Multiply by 9: 1.3959e-4.

Similarly,

[Co_2] = β1 β2 [Co_0] [S]^2 =9*40 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^2.

Compute 9*40=360.

So 360 *1.551e-4=5.5836e-2.

Multiply by (0.1)^2=0.01: 5.5836e-4.

Wait, wait.

Wait, [Co_2] = β1 * β2 * [Co_0] * [S]^2.

So, 9*40=360.

So 360 * [Co_0] * (0.1)^2.

[Co_0] is 1.551e-4.

So 360 * 1.551e-4 = (360 * 1.551) *1e-4.

360 *1.551 → let's compute 360 *1.5=540, 360 *0.051=18.36 → total 558.36.

So 558.36 *1e-4 = 5.5836e-2.

Multiply by (0.1)^2=0.01 → 5.5836e-4.

So [Co_2]≈5.5836e-4 M.

Hmm, let's compute all:

[Co_0] = 1.551e-4

[Co_1] =1.3959e-4

[Co_2]=5.5836e-4

[Co_3]= β1β2β3 [Co_0] [S]^3.

Compute β1β2β3=9*40*63= 9*40=360; 360*63=22680.

So 22680 * [Co_0] * (0.1)^3.

[Co_0] is 1.551e-4.

22680 *1.551e-4 = 22680 * 0.0001551.

Let me compute 22680 * 0.0001551.

22680 * 0.0001=2.268.

22680 * 0.00005=1.134.

22680 * 0.0000051≈ 22680 *5.1e-6 = 0.115188.

Adding up: 2.268 +1.134=3.402, plus 0.115188≈3.517.

Multiply by (0.1)^3=0.001 → 3.517 *0.001=0.003517.

Wait, no, wait. [Co_3] = β1β2β3 [Co_0] [S]^3.

Which is 22680 * [Co_0] * (0.1)^3.

Wait, [Co_0] is 1.551e-4, so 22680 *1.551e-4 = 22680 *0.0001551.

Let me compute this:

22680 * 1.551e-4 = ?

1.551e-4 is 0.0001551.

So 22680 * 0.0001551.

Compute 22680 * 0.0001 = 2.268

22680 *0.00005 = 1.134

22680 *0.0000051 = 0.115188.

Adding them: 2.268 +1.134=3.402 + 0.115188=3.517188.

So, 3.517188.

Multiply by (0.1)^3=0.001 → 3.517188 * 0.001 = 0.003517188.

Wait, no, wait: [Co_3] is 22680 * [Co_0] * (0.1)^3.

So [Co_3] = 22680 * 1.551e-4 * 0.001.

Wait, 1.551e-4 is 0.0001551. Multiply by 0.001 gives 0.0000001551.

So 22680 * 1.551e-7.

Wait, 22680 * 1.551e-7 = 22680 * 1.551 * 1e-7.

Hmm, 22680 *1.551 → let's compute that.

22680 *1=22680

22680 *0.5=11340 → total 34020.

22680 *0.051 → 22680 *0.05=1134; 22680 *0.001=22.68 → 1134+22.68=1156.68.

So total 34020 +1156.68=35176.68.

Multiply by 1e-7 → 35176.68e-7 = 0.003517668 M.

So [Co_3]≈0.003517668 M.

Wait, that seems high, but let's proceed.

[Co_4] = β1β2β3β4 [Co_0][S]^4.

β1β2β3β4=9*40*63*16= let's compute:

9*40=360, *63=22680, *16=362880.

So 362880 * [Co_0] * (0.1)^4.

[Co_0] is 1.551e-4.

So (0.1)^4 = 1e-4.

So 362880 *1.551e-4 *1e-4 → 362880 *1.551e-8.

Compute 362880 *1.551e-8.

362880 is 3.6288e5.

3.6288e5 *1.551e-8 = (3.6288 *1.551) *1e-3.

3.6288 *1.551 ≈ let's compute:

3 *1.551=4.653

0.6288 *1.551 ≈0.6288*1.5=0.9432; 0.6288 *0.051≈0.0320688 → total ~0.9752688.

So 4.653 +0.9752688 ≈5.6282688.

Multiply by 1e-3 → 0.0056282688.

So [Co_4]≈0.005628 M.

Wait, but wait: [Co_4] is calculated as 362880 * [Co_0] * (0.1)^4.

[Co_0]=1.551e-4, [S]=0.1.

So (0.1)^4 =1e-4.

So 362880 *1.551e-4 *1e-4 = 362880 *1.551e-8 → which is 5.628e-3.

So [Co_4]≈5.628e-3 M.

Now, let's sum all the concentrations:

[Co_0] =1.551e-4 ≈0.0001551 M.

[Co_1]=1.3959e-4≈0.0001396 M.

[Co_2]=5.5836e-4≈0.0005584 M.

[Co_3]=0.0035177 M.

[Co_4]=0.005628 M.

Sum them up:

0.0001551 +0.0001396 =0.0002947.

0.0002947 +0.0005584=0.0008531.

0.0008531 +0.0035177=0.0043708.

0.0043708 +0.005628=0.0099988 M.

Which is approximately 0.01 M, which matches the total Co concentration. So that's a good check.

Now, the question is to find the percentage of [Co_2] among all cobalt species.

[Co_2]=5.5836e-4 M.

Total cobalt is 0.01 M.

So the fraction is (5.5836e-4) / (0.01) = 0.055836 → 5.5836%.

Wait, that's about 5.58%, but looking at the options, the closest is not present. Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, did I make a mistake in computing [Co_2]?

Wait, [Co_2] = β1 β2 [Co_0] [S]^2.

Wait, β1=9, β2=40.

So 9*40=360.

[Co_0] is 1.551e-4.

[S]^2 is (0.1)^2=0.01.

So 360 * 1.551e-4 *0.01.

Compute 360 *1.551e-4 = 360 * 0.0001551 = 0.055836.

Multiply by 0.01: 0.00055836 M.

Ah, wait! So [Co_2] is 5.5836e-4 M, which is 0.00055836 M.

So the fraction is (0.00055836) / (0.01) = 0.055836 → 5.5836%.

But none of the options are near 5%. The options are 42%,25%,38%,16%.

Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I accounted for the stability constants.

Wait, earlier I thought that [Co_2] = β1 β2 [Co_0] [S]^2.

But perhaps the correct formula is [Co_2] = β1 β2 [Co_0] [S]^2 / ([something]).

Wait, no, according to the stepwise formation, [Co_1] = β1 [Co_0] [S].

[Co_2] = β2 [Co_1] [S] = β2 β1 [Co_0] [S]^2.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I need to consider the charge on the complexes. The [Co(SCN)_2] is neutral, but the others have varying charges. Does that affect their concentrations? Maybe not, because the calculation already considered the stepwise formation, so the charge is accounted for in the stability constants.

Hmm, another idea: perhaps the problem is that the [Co(SCN)_2] is the only neutral complex, and perhaps it precipitates or something? But the question states it's a solution containing these complexes, so I think all are in solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [Co_2].

Wait, let me recompute [Co_2]:

[Co_2] = β1*β2 * [Co_0] * [S]^2.

β1=9, β2=40.

So 9 *40 =360.

[S] =0.1, so [S]^2=0.01.

[Co_0]=1.551e-4.

Multiply all together:

360 * 1.551e-4 * 0.01.

Compute 360 *1.551e-4 = 0.055836.

Multiply by 0.01: 0.00055836 M.

Yes, that's correct.

So, 0.00055836 / 0.01 = 5.5836% → about 5.58%.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the [Co(SCN)_2] is not [Co(SCN)_2]^0 but something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem refers to the blue color as the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex, which is n=2 with one more SCN-?

Wait, but the question says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN-.

Wait, maybe the complexes are named differently. Alternatively, perhaps the stability constants are for the overall complexes, not stepwise.

Wait, wait, perhaps I confused the definitions of the stability constants. Maybe βn refers to the overall stability constant, not stepwise.

Wait, the problem states "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Ah, so perhaps each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN-.

So, for example, β1 is the stability constant for [CoSCN+], β2 is the constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^something, etc.

Wait, that would change the approach.

So, if βn is the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n], then the formation constant Kf for [Co(SCN)_n] is βn.

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

But wait, if that's the case, then the approach is different.

So, in that scenario, each [Co_n] is given by βn [Co^2+] [S]^n.

In that case, the total Co is sum_{n=0}^4 [Co_n} = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+] [S] + β2 [Co^2+] [S]^2 + β3 [Co^2+] [S]^3 + β4 [Co^2+] [S]^4 = 1e-2.

So, [Co^2+] (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4 ) = 1e-2.

So, solving for [Co^2+] would give [Co^2+] = 1e-2 / (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4 )

Then, the concentration of each [Co_n} is [Co^2+] * βn [S]^n.

So, in this case, let's compute each term.

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[S]=0.1.

Compute each term:

Term0:1.

Term1: β1 [S] =9 *0.1 =0.9.

Term2: β2 [S]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

Term3: β3 [S]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

Term4: β4 [S]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16* 1e-4=0.0016.

Adding all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9+0.4=2.3; 2.3+0.063=2.363; 2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator D=2.3646.

So [Co^2+] =1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.226e-3 M.

Now, compute [Co_2} = [Co^2+] * β2 [S]^2.

β2=40, [S]^2=0.01.

So [Co_2}=4.226e-3 *40 *0.01 =4.226e-3 *0.4 =0.0016904 M.

Total Co is 0.01 M.

So the fraction is 0.0016904 /0.01=0.16904 →16.904%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

So the answer would be D.

But wait, in the previous approach, using stepwise β's, I got about 5.5% for [Co_2}, but that's when β's are stepwise. Now, using the overall β's, I get 16.9%.

Which approach is correct?

Hmm, I think I need to clarify the definition of the stability constants. The problem states they are the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. So, each βn is the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n], not stepwise.

In that case, the second approach is correct, leading to 16.9% for [Co_2}.

But why did the first approach give a different result?

Because in the first approach, the β's were treated as stepwise, meaning each βn is the step from n-1 to n. So, the [Co_n} would be β1*β2*…βn [Co^2+] [S]^n.

But when the problem says "stability constants of the complexes", they are likely the overall Kf for each complex, not the stepwise ones.

So, the correct approach is the second one, leading to 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^{0}, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants and concentrations. The stability constants provided are for the overall complexes, not stepwise, meaning each βn corresponds to the stability constant of the complex with n SCN- ligands.

### Key Information:
- **Total cobalt concentration**: \( [\text{Co}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- **Thiocyanate concentration**: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- **Stability constants**:  
  \[
  \beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = 40, \, \beta_3 = 63, \, \beta_4 = 16
  \]

### Approach:
1. The total cobalt concentration is distributed among all species:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}] = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]
   Substituting the values of β and \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), we calculate the denominator:
   \[
   D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]
   \[
   D = 1 + (9 \cdot 0.1) + (40 \cdot 0.1^2) + (63 \cdot 0.1^3) + (16 \cdot 0.1^4)
   \]
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

2. Solve for \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \):  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{[\text{Co}]}{D} = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
   \]

3. Calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^{0}:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = 40 \cdot (4.226 \times 10^{-3}) \cdot (0.1)^2
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = 40 \cdot 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 0.01 = 0.0016904 \, \text{M}
   \]

4. Determine the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^{0} among all cobalt species:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}]}{[\text{Co}]} \times 100 = \frac{0.0016904}{0.01} \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^{0}, among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
