Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics because of the relativistic effects. I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for the relative speed and the energy formulas for each astronaut.

Let me start by understanding the problem. There are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed (v_rel) between them and the total energy (E) of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting the two velocities. I remember the formula for adding velocities in special relativity. The formula is v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). Oh wait, but which one is u and which is v? Since both are moving in the same direction, I think u is the velocity of the second astronaut from the perspective of the first one. Or wait, no, because in the problem, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So to find the speed of the second as seen by the first, we subtract their speeds, but adjusted by the formula.

Wait, no. Let me think. If I'm astronaut A moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame of reference, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Wait, no, that would be negative. Because 0.5 is less than 0.6, so B is actually moving slower than A from A's perspective. So maybe the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by the relativistic factor?

Wait, no. Let me get the formula straight. The relative speed formula when both velocities are in the same direction. The formula is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). So if u is the
