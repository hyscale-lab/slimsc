Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance to a star. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So a star with a high parallax is nearby, and a low parallax means it's far away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in the sky, I suppose that means there are the same number of stars per unit volume throughout the universe in this model. Wait, but how does that translate to the number of stars within a certain parallax range?

I think I should consider the relationship between parallax (plx) and distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance (where distance is in parsecs, I think). So d = 1/plx.

Now, the number of stars per unit volume depends on the volume. But since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a given volume would be proportional to that volume.

Wait, but how does the volume relate to parallax? Let's think about a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr. The volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to 4πd² dr, because the density is uniform.

But since we're looking at a range of parallax, not distance, I need to express everything in terms of plx. Since plx is 1/d, d = 1/plx. So, substituting d in terms of plx, we get d = 1/plx.

So the volume element for a shell with thickness dplx (a small change in parallax) would be:

Wait, no. Parallax plx is 1/d. So if the parallax changes by a small amount dplx, that corresponds to a change in distance. Let's compute the distance corresponding to a range of plx.

Let me think: plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The differential distance dr would be the derivative of d with respect to plx. So dr/dplx = d(1/plx)/dplx = -1/(plx²). Oh wait, that gives the change in distance for a change in parallax. But I'm not sure if I'm approaching this correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the number of stars with a parallax between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between those corresponding distances.

So, for a star at parallax plx, the distance is d = 1/plx. The volume between d and d + dr is 4π d² dr. So the number of stars in that volume would be proportional to 4π d² dr.

But I need to express everything in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, dr = d(1/plx) dplx. Oh wait, no. Let me think about differentials.

Let me clarify: plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So, dr = derivative of d with respect to plx multiplied by dplx.

So dr = (d/d plx)(
