Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The system obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, right? But wait, this is the relativistic case. So things are different because of the speed of light limit.

Relativistic effects come into play when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, it's the total energy minus the rest energy. The total energy in relativity is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

But in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), the potential energy is maximum, so the kinetic energy is zero. As the mass moves towards equilibrium, the potential energy decreases and kinetic increases. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum, and the potential is zero.

So the total mechanical energy E is the potential energy at x=A, which is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, the energy equation might be more complex because the kinetic energy is not just classical.

Wait, no. The total mechanical energy E would be the same at all points in the motion because there's no damping or non-conservative forces. So at maximum displacement, the energy is all potential, E = (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point, all energy is kinetic, which in relativity is E_kinetic = (gamma - 1) mc². Because the total energy is gamma mc², so subtracting the rest energy gives the kinetic.

So setting E equal to (gamma - 1) mc²:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v is the maximum speed we're trying to find.

Hmm, but wait, let me think again. The problem is that the potential energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator might not be the same as in the classical case. Oh, wait, the problem states that it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx, so the potential is still (1/2)kx², right? Because F is the negative gradient of the potential. So the potential is indeed (1/2)kx².

So the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA², and that's equal to the maximum kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1) mc².

So (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Let me write that equation:

(1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

We can solve for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote the term (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some variable for simplicity, say, b. So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + b.

Square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + b)^2.

Take reciprocal:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + b)^2.

Rearrange:

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + b)^2].

So,

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + b)^2].

Hmm, substituting back for b:

b = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ].

But let me compute 1 + b:

1 + b = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, the term inside the square is (1 + k A²/(2 m c²) ) squared.

Wait, but let me write the expression for v.

v^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² ]

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² )

Hmm, let me compute 1/(1 + ... )^2 as something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the equation further. Let's see:

Let me take 1/(1 + x)^2 as [1/(1+x)]².

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the denominator as (something squared).

Wait, the denominator is (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) squared.

Let me factor out 1/(2 m c²) from the numerator and denominator? Not sure.

Alternatively, let me think about the expression inside the square root.

The term inside sqrt is [1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ].

Wait, let's compute the denominator:

Denominator = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

So,

1/(Denominator) = [ 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2.

So,

1 - 1/(Denominator) = 1 - [1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²))]^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as [ (Denominator -1 ) / Denominator ].

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's compute the denominator:

[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)] = let's say D.

So,

1 - 1/(D²) = (D² - 1)/D².

So,

v = c * sqrt( (D^2 -1)/(D^2) ) ) = c * sqrt( (D² -1) ) / D.

Hmm, but D is 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²), so D² = [1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²)]² = 1 + (kA²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4
