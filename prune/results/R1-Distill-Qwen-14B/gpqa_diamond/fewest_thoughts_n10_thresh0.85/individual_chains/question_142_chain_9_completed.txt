Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on density matrices, so I'll need to think this through.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. But when it's a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture of projectors.

Let me write this out. The density matrix ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Oh, wait, that's the same as the completely mixed state for a qubit. Because a completely mixed state has maximum entropy and can't be distinguished from a classical mixture of states. So ρ is a completely mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Right, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, it's a point on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside the sphere.

The Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by r = [x, y, z], where each component is related to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The formulas I remember are:

x = (Tr(ρ X))/2
y = (Tr(ρ Y))/2
z = (Tr(ρ Z))/2

Where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, let me get the Pauli matrices right. Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Pauli Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the trace of ρ multiplied by each Pauli matrix divided by 2 gives the components of the Bloch vector.

So first, let's compute each term. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each matrix first. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so when multiplied by 1/2, ρ is [[0.5, 0],[0, 0.5]]. That's the identity matrix multiplied by 0.5, which is correct for the maximally mixed state.

Now, let's compute each component:

1. For X: Tr(ρ X) = Tr( (0.5 I) * X ) = 0.5 Tr(X). The trace of X is 0 because Tr(X) = 0+0 = 0. So x = 0.5 * 0 / 2 = 0. Wait, no, wait. Let me check again. Tr(ρ X) is Tr( (0.5 I) X ), which is 0.5 Tr(X). Tr(X) is 0, so Tr(ρ X)=0. Then x = (0)/2 = 0.

Same for Y: Tr(ρ Y) is Tr(0.5 I Y) = 0.5 Tr(Y). Tr(Y) is 0, so y = 0/2 = 0.

For Z: Tr(ρ Z) is Tr(0.5 I Z) = 0.5 Tr(Z). Tr(Z) is 1 + (-1) = 0. So Tr(ρ Z)=0.5 * 0 = 0. Then z = 0/2=0.

Wait, that can't be right because the Bloch vector would be (0,0,0), which is the completely mixed state's representation. Oh right, because the maximally mixed state is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere. So the answer would be option C, which is (0,0,0).

Wait, let me make sure. For the completely mixed state ρ = I/2, yes, each component is zero because the expectation values of X, Y, Z are all zero. So the Bloch vector is at the origin.

So the options are:

A) (1,1,0)
B) (0,0,1)
C) (0,0,0)
D) (1,1,1)

So the correct answer is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state of a qubit, which corresponds to the completely mixed state with maximum entropy. The geometrical position of a qubit state in the Bloch sphere is determined by the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = [x, y, z] \), where the components are related to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices:

\[
x = \frac{\text{Tr}(\rho X)}{2}, \quad y = \frac{\text{Tr}(\rho Y)}{2}, \quad z = \frac{\text{Tr}(\rho Z)}{2}.
\]

Here, \( X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( Y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( Z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \). The given \( \rho \) simplifies to \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. Since \( \rho \) commutes with all Pauli matrices, the traces \( \text{Tr}(\rho X) \), \( \text{Tr}(\rho Y) \), and \( \text{Tr}(\rho Z) \) are all zero. Thus:

\[
x = 0, \quad y = 0, \quad z = 0.
\]

This means the Bloch vector is at the origin, \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to the maximally mixed state. Among the options provided:

- **A)** \( (1, 1, 0) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.
- **B)** \( (0, 0, 1) \): Incorrect, as this represents a pure state along the \( z \)-axis.
- **C)** \( (0, 0, 0) \): Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state.
- **D)** \( (1, 1, 1) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to any valid qubit state.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
