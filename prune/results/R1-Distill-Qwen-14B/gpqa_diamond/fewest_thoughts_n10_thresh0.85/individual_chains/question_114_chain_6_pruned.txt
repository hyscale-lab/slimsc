Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I need to choose between the options A, B, C, D, which give possible reagents for A and B.

Let me break this down. First, the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, what's the product structure? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ion, I think this is an example of a nucleophilic addition to a ketone. Normally, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition where the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon. But wait, in this case, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Hmm.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If it adds CN-, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN? No, wait. Wait, let me think. The reaction of a ketone with HCN is typically: R2CO + HCN â†’ R2C(OH)CN. But wait, NaCN in what conditions? Because HCN is a weak acid, but NaCN is a source of CN^- which is a good nucleophile.

Wait, so butan-2-one ( (CH3)2CO ) reacting with NaCN might form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure:

2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If the CN adds, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butane is four carbons. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so that's three carbons (butanone is four, but the 2
