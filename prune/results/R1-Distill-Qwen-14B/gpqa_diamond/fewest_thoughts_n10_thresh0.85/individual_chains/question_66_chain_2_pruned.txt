Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this SMEFT question. I remember SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's used when you have new physics at a higher energy scale, and you write down all possible interactions respecting the Standard Model's symmetries but with higher dimension operators. 

The question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry.

Hmm, let's break it down. First, I think about what each symmetry implies. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. But does SMEFT require all operators to have Poincare symmetry?

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Effective theories usually don't include things like non-perturbative effects, but they should still respect all the symmetries of the underlying theory. The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, Poincare, CP, and CPT. So if SMEFT is an extension, it should preserve these as well.

But wait, SMEFT includes higher-dimension operators. Do these operators necessarily preserve all symmetries? For example, some operators might break Lorentz symmetry? Or is it that the SMEFT is built in a way that enforces Lorentz symmetry?

I think the key is that SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because all the operators are constructed as Lorentz-invariant, so any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz (1) is a must.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. But in effective theories, sometimes you work in a certain frame, say the center-of-momentum frame, so translation invariance might not be explicitly considered. Or wait, no, because SMEFT is supposed to be valid up to some cutoff, but still, the operators must be local, so they should respect Poincare. But I'm a bit fuzzy on whether SMEFT assumes Poincare or not. Alternatively, if an operator respects Lorentz and is local (i.e., translation invariant), then it's part of a Poincare-invariant theory. So perhaps SMEFT respects Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but the way SMEFT is constructed, the operators are built to be Lorentz-invariant. So they respect Lorentz, but do they necessarily respect Poincare? Poincare includes translations, so the operators must also respect that. Because, for example,
