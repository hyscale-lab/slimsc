Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, rhombohedral crystal, right? I remember that rhombohedral means all the edges are the same length, and all the angles are equal. Oh wait, the question says the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So that fits the definition of a rhombohedral structure.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for calculating interplanar distance uses the unit cell parameters and the plane indices. Let me think... Oh right, the formula is d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... something with the angles maybe? Wait, no, wait. I remember that for cubic systems, it's just a over the square root of (h² + k² + l²), but rhombohedral isn't cubic because the angles are different.

Wait, I think for a general crystal system, especially when the lattice isn't cubic, the formula for interplanar distance is a bit more complicated. Oh wait, the general formula is d_hkl = (a^2 (sinα sinβ sinγ)^(1/2) ) / ( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos α cos β cos γ) / (sin α sin β sin γ)) ) )^(1/2) ) or something like that. No, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, I remember that the interplanar distance can be found using the formula involving the reciprocal of the metric tensor. The metric tensor is used to calculate the reciprocal vectors, which then relate to the interplanar distances.

Let me think. The general formula for interplanar distance is given by:

d^2 = ( (a^2)(h² + k² + l²) - (b^2)(h k cos γ + ... )) ) / something... Wait, no, perhaps I should approach this step by step.

Wait, for a rhombohedral crystal, all the lattice parameters a, b, c are equal, right? Because in a rhombohedral structure, a = b = c. Oh yes, that's correct. So a = b = c = 10 Angstrom in this case.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Wait, no, wait. No, in a rhombohedral system, it's either primitive rhombohedral (trigonal) where all angles are equal, or sometimes a face-centered variant, but the question probably assumes the simple case.

So the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal (trigonal system) is given by:

d_hkl = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) )

Wait, no, wait. I think the correct formula is:

d^2 = [ (a^2)(h² + k² + l²) + (a^2)(hk (cos γ) + hl (cos β) + kl (cos α)) ) ]^(-1) 

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the reciprocal lattice. The reciprocal space vectors are given by the metric tensor.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos γ) + 2(hl \cos β) + 2(kl \cos α) }} }

Wait, no. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me look for the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

I remember that in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice parameters a, b, c are equal (a = b = c = a0), and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all equal (each 30 degrees in this case). So the formula for interplanar distance simplifies.

The general formula for interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk \cos γ) + 2(hl \cos β) + 2(kl \cos α) } }

Wait, no, because I think the formula actually is:

d^2 = \frac{1}{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos γ) + 2(hl \cos β) + 2(kl \cos α)}}

Wait, no, that can't be because the units wouldn't match. Oh, wait, no—this is the reciprocal of d squared, multiplied by (a^2) perhaps.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reciprocal of d squared. In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a² + 2(hk cos γ)/(a²) + 2(hl cos β)/(a²) + 2(kl cos α)/(a²)

Wait, but since a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma, this simplifies.

So for our case, a = 10 Angstrom, angles are 30 degrees, and the plane is (111).

So h = 1, k=1, l=1.

Putting these into the formula:

1/d² = (1² + 1² + 1²) / (a²) + 2(1*1 * cos 30) / (a²) + 2(1*1 * cos 30) / (a²) + 2(1*1 * cos 30) / (a²)

Wait, wait, no. Because in the general formula, for a rhombohedral lattice, the expression is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) / a² + 2hk cos gamma/(a²) + 2hl cos beta/(a²) + 2kl cos alpha/(a²)

But since all angles are 30 degrees, and a = b = c, and alpha=beta=gamma=30°, then:

1/d² = [ (h² +k² + l²) + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha ] / a²

But since all angles are 30°, cos gamma = cos beta = cos alpha = cos 30° = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So substituting h=k=l=1:

Numerator:
(1 + 1 + 1) + 2*(1)(1)(0.8660) + 2*(1)(1)(0.8660) + 2*(1)(1)(0.8660)
= 3 + 2*(0.8660)*3
Wait, let me compute step by step.

Compute each term:

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

2hk cos gamma: 2*1*1 * cos(30) = 2*(0.8660) ≈ 1.732.

Similarly, 2hl cos beta = same as above, 1.732.

And 2kl cos alpha = same, another 1.732.

Wait, wait, no. Let's clarify. The formula is:

1/d² = [ h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha ] / a²

So substituting:

h=k=l=1 → h² +k² +l² =3.

Then, 2hk cos gamma = 2*(1)(1)*cos30 ≈ 1.732.

Similarly for 2hl cos beta and 2kl cos alpha: each is 1.732.

So total numerator is 3 + 1.732 + 1.732 + 1.732.

Adding them up: 3 + 3*1.732 = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So numerator is 8.196.

Denominator is a², which is 10^2 = 100 (in Angstrom squared).

So 1/d² = 8.196 / 100 → 0.08196.

Then, d² = 1/0.08196 ≈ 12.2.

So d is sqrt(12.2) ≈ 3.49 Angstrom.

Wait, wait a second, that can't be right because the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, but the interplanar distance is smaller than 10. But in this case, the calculation gives d ≈3.49, which is much smaller than 10, which makes sense because it's the distance between planes, not individual atoms.

Wait, but the options given are all around 9 Angstrom. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I inverted the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt(...). So substituting, d = 10 / sqrt(8.196).

Wait, sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.866.

So 10 / 2.866 ≈ 3.49. Same as before.

But the options are all in the 8-10 range. So I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong formula. Perhaps I should be using the formula for interplanar spacing in terms of the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, alternative approach: The interplanar distance d is given by:

d = 1/(sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b cos γ)^2 + (l/c cos α)^2 - (2 h k (cos β) )/(a b) + ... ) )

Wait, perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the Miller indices and the unit cell vectors.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a rhombohedral system, which is:

d^2 = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + a² (hk (cos (180 - 2 gamma)) + hl (cos (180 - 2 beta)) + kl (cos (180 - 2 alpha))) ))^{-1}

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for the correct formula for a general rhombohedral system.

Wait, I think I should try looking up (mentally) the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. From what I recall, the formula for d in a rhombohedral system (which is a special case of a hexagonal system?) No, wait, rhombohedral is a type of trigonal system.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the metric matrix. The metric matrix is:

[ a², a b cos γ, a c cos β ]
[ a b cos γ, b², b c cos α ]
[ a c cos β, b c cos α, c² ]

But in our case, a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So the metric matrix becomes:

[ 10², 10*10 cos30, 10*10 cos30 ]
[ 10*10 cos30, 10², 10*10 cos30 ]
[ 10*10 cos30, 10*10 cos30, 10² ]

So that's:

[ 100, 100*(√3/2), 100*(√3/2) ]
[ 100*(√3/2), 100, 100*(√3/2) ]
[ 100*(√3/2), 100*(√3/2), 100 ]

Which is:

[ 100, 50√3, 50√3 ]
[ 50√3, 100, 50√3 ]
[ 50√3, 50√3, 100 ]

The reciprocal metric matrix is needed for the reciprocal lattice, which would give the interplanar distances. The reciprocal metric tensor elements are given by:

G' = 1/(a²) * [ l² + m² + n², ... ] I think. Alternatively, the reciprocal metric tensor (G') is the inverse of the metric tensor (G).

Wait, the metric tensor G is the matrix with elements G_ij, and the reciprocal metric tensor G' has elements G'_ij = (1/det G) * C_ij, where C_ij is the cofactor matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

But maybe there's a simpler way. The interplanar distance is given by d = 1/√(h² G'_h + k² G'_k + l² G'_l + 2 h k G'_{hk} + 2 h l G'_{hl} + 2 k l G'_{kl} ), where G' is the reciprocal metric tensor.

Wait, perhaps I can compute G' and then plug in the values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the determinant of the metric tensor, then invert it.

Let me compute the determinant of G.

The determinant of G for a rhombohedral system (a = b = c, alpha = beta = gamma = theta) can be found as:

det(G) = a^4 (1 + 2 cos theta (cos^2 theta - 1/3) ) )

Wait, but I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant for the given matrix.

Given the metric matrix G as:

[ a², ab cos γ, ac cos β ]
[ ab cos γ, b², bc cos α ]
[ ac cos β, bc cos α, c² ]

But in our case, a = b = c = 10, and all angles are 30 degrees.

So G becomes:

[ 100, 100 cos30, 100 cos30 ]
[ 100 cos30, 100, 100 cos30 ]
[ 100 cos30, 100 cos30, 100 ]

So:

G = [
[ 100, 50√3, 50√3 ],
[ 50√3, 100, 50√3 ],
[ 50√3, 50√3, 100 ]
]

Computing the determinant of G. Let me compute it step by step.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix:

| A B C |
| D E F |
| G H I |

is A(EI - FH) - B(DI - FG) + C(DH - EG).

So applying this to G:

A = 100, B=50√3, C=50√3

D=50√3, E=100, F=50√3

G=50√3, H=50√3, I=100

Computing:

det(G) = 100*(100*100 - (50√3)*(50√3)) ) - (50√3)*( (50√3)*100 - (50√3)*(50√3) ) + 50√3*( (50√3)*(50√3) - 100*50√3 )

Let me compute each part:

First term: 100*(10000 - (50√3)^2 )

(50√3)^2 = 2500 * 3 =7500.

So 10000 -7500=2500.

So first term: 100 *2500= 250,000.

Second term: -50√3 * ( (50√3*100) - (50√3 *50√3) )

Compute inside the bracket:

50√3 *100 =5000√3.

50√3*50√3 = 2500 *3=7500.

So inside becomes 5000√3 -7500.

So second term:

-50√3 * (5000√3 -7500 )

= -50√3 *5000√3 + 50√3 *7500 

Compute each part:

50√3 *5000√3 = 50 *5000 * (√3)^2 = 250000 *3 =750,000.

50√3 *7500 = 50 *7500 *√3 = 375000√3.

So the second term becomes:

-750,000 +375000√3.

Wait, but this is multiplied by -50√3. Wait, the entire second term is -50√3 multiplied by (5000√3 -7500), which is (5000√3 -7500).

Wait, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, the term is:

- B * ( D I - F G )

Which in numbers is -50√3 * (50√3 *100 - (50√3 *50√3)).

Wait, (50√3 *100) =5000√3.

(50√3 *50√3 )= 7500.

So (5000√3 -7500).

So the second term is -50√3 * (5000√3 -7500) = -50√3 *5000√3 + 50√3 *7500.

Which is:

-50 *5000 *3 + 50 *7500 *√3.

Which is:

-750,000 + 375,000√3.

Wait, yeah.

Third term: C*( D H - E G ) 

Which is 50√3 * ( (50√3)(50√3) - 100 *50√3 )

Compute inside:

(50√3)(50√3) = 7500.

100 *50√3 =5000√3.

So inside is 7500 -5000√3.

So third term: 50√3 * (7500 -5000√3 )

= 50√3 *7500 -50√3 *5000√3

= 375,000√3 - 50*5000*3.

Which is:

375,000√3 - 750,000.

So now, putting all together:

det(G) = first term + second term + third term.

First term: 250,000.

Second term: (-750,000) +375,000√3.

Third term: 375,000√3 -750,000.

Adding all:

250,000 + (-750,000) +375,000√3 + 375,000√3 + (-750,000 )

= (250,000 -750,000 -750,000) + (375,000√3 +375,000√3 )

= (-1,250,000) + (750,000√3 )

Hmm, that's a negative plus a positive. But since sqrt(3) is about 1.732, let's compute numerically.

750,000 *1.732 ≈ 1,299,000.

So 1,299,000 -1,250,000 =49,000.

So det(G) ≈49,000 Angstrom^6.

Wait, but this is an approximation. Let me compute it more accurately.

750,000 *1.7320508075688772 ≈ 750,000 *1.7320508075688772 = 1,299,038.105680158.

So det(G) = 1,299,038.105680158 - 1,250,000 = 49,038.105680158.

So det(G) ≈49,038.106 Angstrom^6.

Now, the reciprocal metric tensor G' is the inverse of G, which can be computed as (1/det(G)) * adjugate(G). But I'm not sure how to proceed with that without getting into a lot of matrix math, which might be time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find another formula for the interplanar distance. I think I recall another approach using the formula:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2hk \cos \gamma + 2hl \cos \beta + 2kl \cos \alpha } }

Wait, but earlier when I tried this, I got a d of about 3.49 Angstrom, which doesn't match the options. But the options are around 9 Angstrom, so I must have used the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula where d is given by:

d = (a^2 (sin α sin β sin γ) )^(1/2) / [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ]^(1/2) )

Wait, this formula is for the cubic case, but modified for the rhombohedral case. Let me try plugging in the numbers.

Wait, but a is 10. So a^2 =100.

Compute numerator: a^2 (sin α sin β sin gamma) = 100 * (sin30)^3.

Sin30 is 0.5, so (0.5)^3=0.125.

So numerator: 100 * 0.125=12.5.

Take square root: sqrt(12.5) ≈3.5355.

Denominator: [(h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)].

h,k,l=1, so h^2 +k^2 +l^2=3.

Each of the other terms: hk cos gamma=1*1 *0.8660=0.8660.

There are three such terms, so 2*(3*0.8660) = 2*2.598=5.196.

So denominator becomes 3 +5.196=8.196.

Take square root: sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d = (3.5355) / 2.863 ≈1.235 Angstrom.

Wait, again, this is around 1.235, which is even smaller than before. This can't be right because the options are 8-10 Angstrom.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should use is the inverse of what I did before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of d, not d itself. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused between the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. Let me try to approach this from another angle.

Another approach: The interplanar distance d is given by the formula:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) } }

Wait, but that's for a body-centered cubic structure, perhaps. Or maybe for a different crystal system.

Wait, no, that's probably the formula for simple cubic, but I'm not sure. Let me see:

In simple cubic, hkl planes, d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²).

But that's different from what I have here.

Wait, perhaps for a rhombohedral system, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Wait, that's what I used earlier, but that gave me d=3.49, which is too small.

But perhaps I swapped the formula and it should be a over that square root. Oh wait, no, in the earlier step, I had 1/d² = (3 + ... ) / a², so d² = a²/(3 + ... ), which would make d = a / sqrt(...).

Wait, that's what I did, and it gave me 3.49.

But the options are around 9. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula where the denominator is:

sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) )

Wait, let me try that.

For (111), h=k=l=1.

Denominator: sqrt(3 -3) =0. Which can't be right.

So that's not the formula.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula for d-spacing in reciprocal space.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the volume of the unit cell and the Miller indices.

Wait, the volume of the unit cell for a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta ), where theta is 30 degrees.

Let me compute that.

Volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 -3 cos^2(30) + 2 cos^3(30) )

Compute cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So cos^2= (3/4)=0.75, cos^3= (3*sqrt(3))/8 ≈0.6495.

So V =10^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) )

=1000 * sqrt(1 -2.25 +1.299)

=1000 * sqrt( (1 +1.299) -2.25 )

=1000 * sqrt(2.299 -2.25)

=1000 * sqrt(0.049 )

sqrt(0.049)≈0.2214.

So V≈1000 *0.2214=221.4 Angstrom^3.

But I'm not sure how this helps me calculate the interplanar distance.

Wait, the number of unit cells per volume is 1/V, but perhaps that's not directly helpful here.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral system can be calculated using the formula involving the dot product of the plane normal vectors.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the face-centered cubic (FCC) or similar, but no, FCC is cubic.

Wait, let me think about the different crystal systems. For a simple cubic structure, the (111) plane interplanar distance is a/sqrt(3). For a face-centered cubic (FCC), it's a/(sqrt(2)(sqrt(3)/2)) )= a/(sqrt(3)/sqrt(2)) )= a sqrt(2/3). But that's for cubic systems.

Wait, but in our case, it's a rhombohedral system, which is not cubic. So I can't directly apply those formulas.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the following relation:

d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) )) )

Wait, but for (111), h=k=l=1. So denominator becomes sqrt(3 -3) =0, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the angles. Maybe the formula is more complex.

Alternatively, maybe I should refer to the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system, which is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h/l_1)^2 + (k/l_2)^2 + (l/l_3)^2 } }

But that's probably for hexagonal systems when l3 is different. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } }

Wait, but that's what I tried earlier, which gave me a d of 3.49. Which doesn't fit the options.

Wait, perhaps I have the wrong formula because I'm missing a factor involving the volume.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } } * \sqrt{ \frac{1}{1 - 3 \cos^2 \theta + 2 \cos^3 \theta } }

Wait, where theta is 30 degrees.

So let's compute that.

First, compute the denominator sqrt part: sqrt( (3) + 2*(3 *0.8660) )

Which is sqrt(3 + 5.196) = sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

Then compute the sqrt factor from the volume.

Compute 1 -3*(0.75) +2*(0.6495) =1 -2.25 +1.299= (1+1.299) -2.25=2.299-2.25=0.049.

So sqrt(1/0.049)=sqrt(20.408)≈4.517.

So then, d= (10)/(2.863) *4.517 ≈3.49 *4.517 ≈15.78 Angstrom.

But that's not matching any options either.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is similar to the cubic but modified by the angles.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) ) * sqrt( 1 / (1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta) )

Wait, but I think that's what I did earlier, leading to 15.78, which is larger than the options presented.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of what I did earlier.

Wait, the options are all around 9 Ang. So perhaps the correct d is 9.08 or similar.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct approach is to use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit vectors.

The interplanar distance is given by the formula:

d = [ (a^2 (sin α sin β sin gamma)) ]^(1/2) / [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ]^(1/2) )

Wait, let me compute this.

Compute numerator: sqrt(a^2 (sin α sin β sin gamma)).

= a * sqrt( sinα sinβ singamma )

Since all angles are 30 degrees, sin 30=0.5.

So sinα sinβ singamma = (0.5)^3 = 0.125.

So numerator: a * sqrt(0.125) = 10 * (sqrt(0.125)) =10 * (sqrt(1/8)) =10*(1/(2√2)) )≈10 *0.35355 ≈3.5355.

Denominator: sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

= sqrt( 3 + 2*(3 *0.8660) ) = sqrt(3 +5.196)= sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

So d =3.5355 /2.863≈1.235 Angstrom.

Again, same as before, which doesn't match any options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, but in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is along the edges of the unit cell. So the edges a, b, c are 10 Angstrom. But perhaps the interplanar distance is computed differently.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system as:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Where theta is 30 degrees.

Wait, let's compute that.

h=k=l=1, theta=30.

So denominator: sqrt(3 + 2*(3 * (1*1 * cos30 )) )

= sqrt(3 + 6 *0.8660) = sqrt(3 +5.196 )= sqrt(8.196 )≈2.863.

So d=10 /2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

No, same result. Doesn't fit options.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor. Let me think: perhaps in rhombohedral systems, the (111) plane is a close-packed plane, so the interplanar distance is related to the nearest neighbor distance. But the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Oh wait, the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral structure is the edge length a, which is 10 Angstrom.

Wait, the interplanar distance can't be larger than the interatomic distance, but the options are all about 9-10 Angstrom. So maybe the correct approach is different.

Alternative idea: perhaps the (111) plane in a rhombohedral structure is similar to the (100) plane in a cubic structure, which would have d = a.

But that's 10 Angstrom, but in the options, D is 10.05.

But that can't be right.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral system can be approximated using the formula for a hexagonal system, but that's a stretch.

Wait, in a hexagonal system, the (111) plane has d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + hk +k^2) ), but that's for hexagonal close-packed.

Wait, but perhaps the formula for rhombohedral is similar to hexagonal. So for h=k=l=1,

d = a / sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) + (something)).

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:

d = 2a / sqrt(3) ) * (sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but that's more like for calculating atomic spacing in a crystal.

Wait, perhaps that's not it.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral structure is equal to a divided by sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ), where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors, which is 30 degrees.

But that's what I did earlier, giving d=3.49.

But if the options don't match, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Another approach: perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) )

Wait, but for (111), that would be sqrt(3-3)=0, which is impossible.

So that must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) cos theta ) / ... Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the basis vectors are a, b, c, each with length a=10 Angstrom, and the angles between each pair is 30 degrees.

The (111) plane is defined by the vectors:

v1 = a + b + c.

Wait, the normal vector to the plane is (1,1,1), so the plane equation is h x + k y + l z = d, where h=k=l=1.

The interplanar distance d is given by 1/(sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b cos gamma)^2 + (l/c cos beta)^2 - ... )).

Wait, perhaps taking vectors approach:

The reciprocal vectors are given by the formula:

b1 = (2 pi/a) ( ... )

But perhaps I should compute the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should try to look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )^{-1}

Wait, but that's the same as the formula I've been using.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reciprocal. Let me try to compute it again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Which is what I've done all along.

So with a=10, and the denominator sqrt(8.196)=2.863, d=10/2.863≈3.49.

But none of the options are near this. So perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the distance between adjacent planes, which would be d, but perhaps the interatomic distance is given as the edge length, but the interplanar distance is much smaller.

But the options are 8-10, so perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the angles are gamma, beta, alpha, but perhaps I used them in the wrong order.

Wait, wait. In the metric tensor, the angles are between a and b, a and c, and b and c.

So in the formula, the angles used in the terms are:

hk cos gamma,

hl cos beta,

kl cos alpha.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the angles.

Wait, in the formula, the angle between a and b is gamma, between a and c is beta, and between b and c is alpha.

Wait, no, actually, in crystallography, the angles are defined as follows:

alpha is the angle between b and c vectors,

beta is between a and c,

gamma is between a and b.

Wait, perhaps I got the angles mixed up.

Wait, the standard definitions are:

alpha is the angle between b and c.

beta is the angle between a and c.

gamma is the angle between a and b.

In the problem statement, all angles are 30 degrees.

So in the formula, the cos gamma is cos(30), cos beta is cos(30), cos alpha is cos(30).

So that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the formula uses the angles differently.

Alternatively, perhaps in the formula, the terms are:

hk cos gamma,

hl cos beta,

kl cos alpha.

So with all angles being 30, that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula for a rhombohedral system.

Looking up a reference (mentally), I found that the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Which is what I used.

So, with a=10,

sqrt(3 + 2*(3 *0.8660)) = sqrt(3 +5.196) =sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But this doesn't match any of the options, which are all around 9 Angstrom.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a conceptual mistake. Maybe the (111) plane is not first-order reflection, or perhaps there's a miscalculation in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ), but with theta being 30 degrees.

Wait, let's try that.

Denominator: sqrt(3 - 2*(3) *0.8660 )

= sqrt(3 - 5.196 )

= sqrt(-2.196 ), which is imaginary. Not possible.

Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system with angles less than 90 degrees, the formula is different. Wait, but I don't have that info.

Another approach: perhaps the interatomic distance is not the same as a. Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Oh! Wait, perhaps a is the interatomic distance.

In a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is along the edges of the unit cell, so a, b, c are the interatomic distances. So a=10 Angstrom.

So the earlier calculation of d=3.49 seems correct, but none of the options match.

But the options are all around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I swapped a and d.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the inverse.

Wait, 1/d = (3.49), so d=0.286, which is even smaller.

No, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the (111) planes are in a different orientation, and perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated differently.

Wait, maybe the formula should use the reciprocal of the denominator I calculated.

No, that would give d=2.863, which is about 2.86, which is still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) ) )

Wait, (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)=3,

(hk + hl + kl)=3,

so denominator sqrt(0)=0 → d is infinite. Not possible.

Hmm...

Perhaps I should try using the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

Given the metric tensor G, the reciprocal metric tensor G' is such that G G' = I (identity matrix).

The reciprocal metric tensor has elements:

G'^ij = (C^ij ) / det(G),

where C^ij is the cofactor matrix.

But computing this would take time, and maybe I can find a shortcut.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the reciprocal lattice vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) ( ... )

Wait, but perhaps the formula for the reciprocal vectors in a rhombohedral system is:

b1 = (2π/a) (1, 1, 1) / sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + 2*(1)(1) cos gamma + 2*(1)(1) cos beta + 2*(1)(1) cos alpha )

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the magnitude of the reciprocal vector is |b|= 2π/d, where d is the interplanar distance.

So, |b|=2π/d.

But I don't know |b|.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal of the metric tensor's (1,1,1) element is related to d.

Wait, the (1,1,1) element of the reciprocal metric tensor is equal to (1/d^2).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor's (hkl) element, which is 1/d².

But I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach, like using the Bragg's law, but that's not directly helpful here.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by:

d = (a^2 (sinα sinβ singamma) )^(1/2) / (h² +k² +l² + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to d=3.5355 /2.863 ≈1.235 Angstrom.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of this value, which is ≈ 8.1. Which is close to option A (9.08) and option B (8.95).

Hmm, wait, 1/1.235≈0.81, which is not close to 8 or 9.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) * sqrt(1/(1 - 3 cos² theta + 2 cos^3 theta) )

Earlier, I computed sqrt(1/(0.049))≈4.517.

So, d=10/(2.863)*4.517≈3.49 *4.517≈15.78.

Which is way higher than the options, so that can't be correct.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the reciprocal of the interplanar distance.

Wait, 1/d = sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) / a.

But that gives 1/d =2.863/10=0.2863 → d=3.49, which is what I had before.

But that's not matching the options.

I'm really stuck here. All my calculations give d around 3.49 Angstrom, but the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the angles are not 30 degrees, but 150 degrees. Because in some crystal systems, the angles used are the supplementary angles.

Wait, the user provided alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees. But perhaps in the formula, the angles are 180-30=150 degrees.

Wait, let me try that. Let's recalculate with cos 150.

cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.8660.

So the denominator becomes:

3 + 2*(3*(-0.8660)) =3 + 2*(-2.598)=3-5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative, so the square root is imaginary. That can't be possible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the absolute value of the cosines.

Wait, no, that would change the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should use the angles between the reciprocal vectors, not the direct lattice vectors.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Which would be:

sqrt(3 - 2*(3 *0.8660) )= sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula—perhaps the cross terms are subtracted.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

But that gives a negative under the square root.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the inverse of the metric tensor's (1,1,1) element.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos(180 - gamma) + hl cos(180 - beta) + kl cos(180 - alpha) ) )

Which would be cos(150) for each, which is -0.866.

So denominator:

3 + 2*(3*(-0.866))=3 -5.196=−2.196 → square root is imaginary. So no.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

But that gives a negative denominator for this case.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. All the approaches I've tried don't yield an answer matching the options. I must have a wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula for a simple cubic system, but with a adjusted for the angles.

In simple cubic, d= a/sqrt(3) for (111).

Here, a=10. So d=10/sqrt(3)=5.773. Still not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the distance between adjacent (111) planes, which is d, but I'm not considering some factor. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, but that's not a rhombohedral.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) )

Which for (111) is:

sqrt(3 -3 )=0 → d is infinite. No.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe the interplanar distance can be found using the volume of the unit cell and the Miller indices.

The volume V is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta ), theta=30.

Which is V=10^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.125*sqrt(3)) )

Wait, no, 0.5^3=0.125, but 3*(0.75)=2.25, 2*(0.125)=0.25.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in computing the volume. Let me recompute the volume.

Wait, V= a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta )

theta=30 degrees.

Compute inside the sqrt:

1 -3*( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) +2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

=1 -3*(3/4) +2*( (3*sqrt(3))/(8) )

=1 - 9/4 + (6 sqrt(3))/8 )

= (4/4 -9/4) + (3 sqrt(3))/4 )

= ( -5/4 ) + (3 sqrt(3))/4 )

= ( -5 +3 sqrt(3) ) /4.

Wait, compute numerically:

sqrt(3)=1.732.

3 sqrt(3)=5.196.

So numerator: -5 +5.196=0.196.

So denominator:4.

So inside sqrt: 0.196/4=0.049.

sqrt(0.049)=0.2214.

So volume V=1000 *0.2214=221.4 Angstrom^3.

Hmm.

The number of unit cells per volume is 1/V=1/221.4.

But I'm not sure how this helps.

Alternatively, the number of unit cells per volume is 1/V, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the volume and the plane indices is:

d = (a^2 (sin alpha sin beta sin gamma)) / ( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) )^(1/2) )

Wait, but that's what I tried earlier, leading to d≈3.5355 /2.863≈1.235.

Hmm.

I'm running out of ideas. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by the formula:

d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )) )

Which gives d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49 Angstrom.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and should instead compute the reciprocal.

Wait, 1/d=0.2863 → d=3.49, but options are around 9. So perhaps I should compute 1/d=0.2863 → d=3.49, but how does that relate to the options?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is the reciprocal of what I used earlier.

Wait, if I take d= sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos gamma + ...) ) / a,

then for our case, d= sqrt(8.196)/10=2.863/10=0.2863 Angstrom.

No, still way off.

Hmm.

Oh! Wait a minute. Maybe I swapped the numerator and denominator in the formula.

I think I've been using d= a / sqrt(...), but perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) / a.

So for our case, sqrt(8.196)/10=2.863/10=0.2863.

Still not matching.

Wait, but wait: 1/d =0.2863 → d=3.49.

No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Which for our case would be sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). Imaginary. So no.

Hmm.

Another Idea: Perhaps the formula for a rhombohedral system is the same as for a cubic system, but with a scaled edge length.

Wait, the formula for a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²).

But in our case, the system isn't cubic because the angles are different.

But perhaps, for the purpose of this problem, it's considered as a simple cubic.

So d=10/sqrt(3)=5.773. But that's not matching the options either.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the (111) plane's interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which for (111) and theta=30,

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(3 *0.866 )) =10/sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49 Angstrom.

Again, same result.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the volume in the denominator.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by:

d = (a^2 (sin alpha sin beta sin gamma)) / [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) * (1/(a^2)) ) ]^(1/2)

Wait, which is essentially the same as what I did earlier.

So this brings me back to the same d=3.49, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the distance between two adjacent planes, which would be d, but perhaps the (111) planes are not the first-order reflections, or perhaps the calculation is done differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the interatomic distance along the (111) direction and then find the interplanar distance based on that.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another Idea: In a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be computed using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, but with theta=30.

So denominator: sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*(0.866) )=sqrt(3+5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49.

Again, same result.

Hmm.

I think I've tried all the possible approaches I can think of, but I can't get an answer that matches any of the given options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, or perhaps the angles are to be used differently.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But for theta=30, this gives:

sqrt(3 - 2*(3)*(0.866) )=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary.

So that's not possible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos(theta) + hl cos(theta) + kl cos(theta) ) )

Which would be:

sqrt(3 + 2*(3 *0.866 ))=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49.

Same result.

I'm stuck. I think I must have made a mistake in the formula, but I can't find another approach. Perhaps I should choose the closest option to my calculation, but none are close. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the interplanar distance.

Wait, 1/d = sqrt(8.196)/10=2.863/10=0.2863 → d=1/0.2863≈3.49.

No, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the distance using the volume.

Wait, the number of unit cells per volume is 1/V =1/221.4.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all approaches. Perhaps the correct answer is A)9.08, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of sqrt(3) somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt(3) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Which would be 10 * 1.732 /2.863 ≈17.32/2.863≈6.05 Angstrom.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) * sqrt(1/ (1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta) )

Which is the same as what I did earlier, giving d≈15.78.

Not matching.

Hmm.

After all these attempts, I think the correct answer must be option A)9.08 Angstrom, but I can't see how to get there. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct calculation gives 9.08.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) * sqrt( (1 -3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta) )

Which would be 10/sqrt(8.196) * sqrt(0.049) →3.49 *0.221≈0.772.

No, that's even smaller.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator I used earlier.

Wait, 1/2.863≈0.349. So d=10*0.349≈3.49.

No.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck and must conclude that the correct answer is A)9.08. But I'm not confident because I can't see how to get there. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula gives d=9.08, but I'm missing something.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)}}
\]

### Step 1: Substituting the given values
- \( h = k = l = 1 \) (for the (111) plane),
- \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \),
- \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \).

The denominator becomes:
\[
\sqrt{(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) + 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ)}
\]

### Step 2: Simplifying the expression
- \( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \),
- \( 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) = 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866) = 2(3 \cdot 0.866) = 5.196 \).

Thus, the denominator is:
\[
\sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( d_{111} \)
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 4: Analyzing the options
The calculated value of \( d_{111} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9–10 Å. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the formula or a misunderstanding of the problem setup. However, based on the options provided, the closest plausible answer is **A) 9.08 Å**, though the reasoning to reach this value remains unclear.

ANSWER: A
