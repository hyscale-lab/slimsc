Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm going to try to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about stars with spots and how that affects the brightness variations observed, similar to an exoplanet transit. Interesting.

So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because the star is rotating, these spots will modulate the brightness as they come into view. And the question is asking: if instead, this brightness variation was caused by an exoplanet transiting the star, what would the planet's radius have to be relative to the star's radius to produce the same signal amplitude?

I remember that the brightness change in a transit is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the dip in brightness is (Rp / Rstar)^2, right? Because the area blocked is the area of the planet compared to the star's disk.

But wait, in this case, the spots are causing the variation. So I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots and then find the equivalent planet radius that would cause the same dip.

First, let me get the numbers straight. The filling factor is 20%, which is 0.2. So the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere they're on. But wait, the star's hemisphere is half the surface area, so the total spot area is 0.2 * (surface area of a hemisphere). Hmm, but the star's total surface area is 4πR², so hemisphere is 2πR². So the spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Wait, but does that matter? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface that's covered by spots. Wait, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 0.2. So in the hemisphere, 20% is covered by spots.
