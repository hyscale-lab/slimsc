Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, it's a rhombohedral crystal with a given interatomic distance and angles. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Alright, let's think.

Wait, rhombohedral crystal... I remember that a rhombohedral system has all sides equal but the angles can be different. Oh wait, no, in this case, all angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. So it's a special case where the lattice parameters are a = b = c, and all angles are 30 degrees. Or wait, wait, rhombohedral is a type of Bravais lattice where a, b, c are all equal, and the angles are all equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this question, all the angles are 30 degrees, which is quite an unusual case.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Hmm, interatomic distance in a crystal usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along one lattice parameter. Wait, in a cubic system, the interatomic distance would be 'a', since each edge is 'a'. But for a rhombohedral system, since a, b, c are equal but angles are different, the actual interatomic distance along the edges would still be 'a', right?

Wait, no, perhaps the interatomic distance is 'a' in the rhombohedral system. So in
