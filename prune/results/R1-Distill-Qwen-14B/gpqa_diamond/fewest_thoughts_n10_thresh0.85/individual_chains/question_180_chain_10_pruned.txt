Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm. I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since the system is isolated, we can consider the potential energy contributions between each pair of charges.

Wait, but the charges are placed at two different locations. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2m from P. So, each of these 12 charges is 2m away from the central charge.

I think the total potential energy will be the sum of the potential energies between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. Because each of the 12 is at the same distance from P, but their mutual distances will vary. Wait, wait, no. If all 12 are at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. But since they're constrained to stay at that distance, perhaps they're on a sphere of radius 2m around P. So their mutual distances would be the distances between points on a sphere, but that's complicated. Hmm, but when calculating the potential energy for all pairs, perhaps we can find a way to minimize it.

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the configuration that gives the minimum potential energy is when all the 12 charges are equally spaced on a sphere around P. But wait, wait a second. Actually, potential energy in electrostatics for a system of like charges (all positive) is always positive because you have to do work against their mutual repulsion. But wait, wait, in this case, are all the charges the same? The problem says they are identical particles each with charge 2e. So, assuming each is positive, because e is the elementary charge (about 1.6e-19 C). So all charges are positive, so they repel each other. So arranging them in a way that minimizes the potential energy would mean arranging them as close as possible, but in this problem, the 12 are constrained to be at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed in a sphere of radius 2m, but their exact positions on the sphere might affect the total potential energy.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So I think their exact positions relative to each other don't affect their distance from P, but they can be anywhere on the sphere. So the potential energy between any two of them would depend on the distance between them. To minimize the total potential energy, I need to arrange them such that the sum of all the potential energies between each pair is as small as possible.

Wait, but when you have multiple charges on a sphere, the potential energy between two charges depends on the angle between them relative to the center. The potential energy is inversely proportional to the distance between them. So to minimize the potential energy, which is U = k * q1 q2 / r, for each pair, you want r to be as large as possible. Because for positive charges, larger r would mean lower potential energy (since it's positive, so making it as small as possible would lower the total energy). Wait, but wait: when all charges are on a sphere, the maximum possible distance between any two charges is the diameter, which is 4m. But actually, for points on a sphere, the maximum distance is 4m, but you can't have all pairs at that maximum. So the question is, what's the configuration that minimizes the sum of U for all pairs.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is equally distant from each other. Like the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require considering the mutual potential energies of the 12 charges because it's too complicated, and perhaps the minimal energy is achieved when the 12 charges are as far apart as possible, but maybe the problem expects us to compute just the potential energies between the 13th charge and the 12 charges, and ignore the mutual potential energies between the 12. That would make the problem manageable.

Wait, but the problem is about the total potential energy of the system. So I must include all pairs: each pair between the 13th and the 12 charges, and each pair among the 12 charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energies are zero, but that can't be because they're all positive and at a fixed distance from P. No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's possible that the mutual potential energies are zero when arranged in a particular symmetric way, but I think that's not the case. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual
