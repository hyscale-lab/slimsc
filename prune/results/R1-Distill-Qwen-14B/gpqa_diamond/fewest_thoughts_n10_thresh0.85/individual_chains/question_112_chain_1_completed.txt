Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let me read it again.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I know that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So first, I probably need to normalize this state because it's given as proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, the question is about calculating the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. So what does this matrix look like?

Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because |up> and |down> are the basis states), the matrix would be:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, no. Wait, the operator's matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j, else 0. So in terms of a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are ħ/2.

So for a two-level system, the matrix would be:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0 ]

Wait, no, actually, wait. If the matrix is 2x2 with A_ij = 0 when i=j, and hbar/2 otherwise. So the matrix is:

A = [ 0      ħ/2;
      ħ/2    0 ]

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm thinking of a different operator. Oh wait, the operator given is with Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So for a two-level system, the matrix would be:

Row 1: [0, hbar/2]
Row 2: [hbar/2, 0]

Hmm, but isn't that a symmetric matrix? So it's like a spin in the x-direction or something similar. Because the Pauli X matrix has 1s off-diagonal, but this has ħ/2.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices usually have entries like [0,1;1,0], but scaled. So the operator here might be (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying by ħ/2 would give the A matrix.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. Those are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So maybe I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates to find the probabilities.

But wait, the question is asking for the probability of measuring each eigenstate of operator A. So the process is: find the eigenstates of A (which are |+x> and |-x>), express |alpha> in terms of these, and then the probabilities are the squares of the coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize the matrix A and find the expansion coefficients of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

Wait, but |alpha> is given in the z-basis. So maybe it's easier to express the eigenstates of A in the z-basis, then compute the inner products.

Let me outline the steps I need to take:

1. Normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional.
2. Find the eigenstates of operator A.
3. Express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.
4. The probabilities are the squares of the coefficients.
5. Compute the average value of the operator A.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, perhaps I can use properties of Pauli matrices to find expectation values without finding the eigenstates.

Wait, but let me proceed step by step.

First, normalize |alpha>.

The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

Compute the norm squared: |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the operator A's matrix is:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Which is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], so indeed A = (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(+1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2.

The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me confirm. For σ_x, the eigenstates are:

|+x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down>)

|-x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down>)

So that's correct.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, scaled by a factor. So the eigenstates are |+A> = |+x> and |−A> = |-x>.

So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to compute <alpha | +A> and <+A | alpha>, and square them, same for the other eigenstate.

Wait, more accurately, the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+A> and |−A> would give the coefficients, and the probabilities are the modulus squared of these coefficients.

So let's compute the coefficients.

First, write |+A> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down> )

Similarly, |−A> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down> )

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So the inner product of |alpha> with |+A> is:

<alpha | +A> = [ (1+i)*1 + (2 - i)*1 ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) )

Wait, wait, no. Let me be precise.

The inner product < +A | alpha> is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So compute it:

(1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))) [ (1+i)*1 + (2 - i)*1 ]

Because when you take the inner product, <up| up> is 1, <down| down> is 1, and cross terms would be zero.

So:

= (1/(sqrt(14))) ) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ) ]

Simplify the numerator:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i =3.

So < +A | alpha> = 3 / sqrt(14)

The probability is (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute < -A | alpha>.

< -A | alpha> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So:

(1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i)*1 + (2 -i)*(-1) ]

Compute numerator:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1 -2) + i(1 +1) = (-1) + 2i.

So < -A | alpha> = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14)

The probability is | (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) |^2 = ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but wait, probabilities should add to 1. Let me check: 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. Yes, correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 — which is 9/14≈0.6428, and 5/14≈0.3571. So 0.64 is roughly 9/14, and 0.36 is roughly 5/14. So option A seems to match these probabilities.

But let's check the average value of the operator.

The average value is <alpha | A | alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is diagonal in its own eigenbasis, the expectation value would be the sum of probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So average value = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5) * ħ ] / (28) ) = (4 ħ ) / 28 = ħ /7.

So the average is ħ/7.

Looking back at option A: average is ħ/7. So option A's first two probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which are approximate, and average is ħ/7.

So option A matches.

But wait, wait, let's compute the expectation value another way to confirm.

Another way: compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a matrix, let's write it out.

The state |alpha> is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So in vector form, the state is:

a = [1+i, 2 -i ]^T / sqrt(7)

Then, A is:

[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ ħ/2, 0 ] ]

So compute <alpha | A | alpha> = a† A a.

Compute a† A a:

= [ (1+i)*, (2 -i)* ] / sqrt(7) * [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ] * [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T / sqrt(7)

Multiply it out:

The matrix product A a is:

[0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)(2 -i) ] = ( ħ/2 (2 -i) )
[ (ħ/2)(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ] = ( ħ/2 (1+i) )

So A a is:

[ ħ/2 (2 -i) ]
[ ħ/2 (1+i) ]

Now, multiply by a†:

(1+i)* [ first component ] + (2 -i)* [ second component ]

But wait, a† is [ (1+i)*, (2 -i)* ] / sqrt(7)

So:

a† A a = [ (1+i)*, (2 -i)* ] / sqrt(7) * [ ħ/2 (2 -i), ħ/2 (1+i) ]^T / sqrt(7)

Which is:

(1/(sqrt(7))^2) [ (1+i)* ( ħ/2 (2 -i) ) + (2 -i)* ( ħ/2 (1+i) ) ]

Simplify 1/(7) times ħ/2 [ (1+i)(2 -i)^* + (2 -i)(1+i)^* ]

Wait, no. Wait:

Let me compute each term:

Term1: (1+i)* * ( ħ/2 (2 -i) )

(1+i)* = 1 - i.

Multiply: (1 -i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²
i² is -1.
So 2 -3i + (-1) =1 -3i.

Term2: (2 -i)* * ( ħ/2 (1+i) )

(2 -i)* = 2 +i.

Multiply: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) + 2i + i(1) + i^2
= 2 + 2i +i -1 = (2-1) +3i =1 +3i.

So sum of term1 and term2: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) )= 2.

So a† A a = (ħ/2) * (2) /7 → (ħ/2 * 2) /7 = ħ/7.

Which matches the previous calculation.

So the average is indeed ħ/7.

Looking back at options, option A has average hbar/7, and probabilities 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.643, but the option says 0.64. 5/14 is about 0.357, which is approximately 0.36. So option A seems to fit.

Wait, but let's check the other options.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46. Hmm, 9/14 is ~0.64, so this isn't close.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72. No.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29. 0.61 is around 0.64, but no.

Wait, so the correct probabilities are 9/14 (~0.6428) and 5/14 (~0.3571). Option A lists 0.64 and 0.36, which are close. So the average is ħ/7. So option A.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues were being considered differently, but no, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: the operator A's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, but perhaps I got the inner product reversed.

Wait, no, because the inner product is <+A|alpha>, which is correct.

So I think the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle
\]

The norm is calculated as:

\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right]
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

This is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, \( \sigma_x \), scaled by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of \( A \) are the same as those of \( \sigma_x \), which are:

\[
|+A\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-A\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle)
\]

### Step 3: Expand |α⟩ in terms of |+A⟩ and |-A⟩
The inner products of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with \( |+A\rangle \) and \( |-A\rangle \) are:

\[
\langle +A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

\[
\langle -A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+A\rangle \) and \( |-A\rangle \) are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+A) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-A) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36
\]

### Step 4: Average value of the operator A
The expectation value of \( A \) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle
\]

Using the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and their corresponding probabilities, the average value is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
