Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that during a titration, the pH changes based on how much of the titrant has been added. So the first part is about the pH at 25% titration, and the second is at the equivalence point.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? Because 20 + 20 = 40. So the concentration after dilution would be half, because the volume doubles. Oh, wait, 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M? So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so when I titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, the reaction should form acetate ions and water. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. 

So, first part: pH at 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Let me think about the moles involved here.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) before dilution: volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 L. Molarity is 0.05 M. So moles = M * V = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M, but the moles remain the same because we just added water. So yes, moles of acetic acid are 0.001.

At 25% titration, 0.25 of that is neutralized. So moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻ + H2O), the moles of CH3COOH remaining would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate (CH3COO⁻) formed would be 0.00025 moles.

Wait, but the total solution volume is 40 cm³ (40 mL), right? Because 20 mL of acetic acid plus 20 mL of water, and then 25% titration would add some NaOH. Wait, no, the NaOH is being added during titration, so the total volume will increase a bit. But for dilute solutions, maybe we can approximate that the volumes are additive, but perhaps in this case, since the concentrations are low, the change in volume is negligible. Alternatively, maybe the question doesn't require considering the exact volume change, so we can proceed with the solution volume as 40 mL plus the volume of NaOH used. But that's getting complicated. Wait, the question is about 25% of the required NaOH to reach equivalence point. Let me think: the equivalence point requires a certain volume of NaOH. So perhaps I should compute the volume of NaOH at 25% of the equivalence point, and then compute the pH accordingly.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the concentrations at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let me start by calculating the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid are 0.001, and since each mole of acetic acid requires one mole of NaOH, the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So at equivalence, 10 mL of NaOH is added.

So at 25% titration, we have added 25% of 10 mL, which is 2.5 mL of NaOH. So the total solution volume is 40 mL (from acetic acid and water) + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL. But wait, maybe that's complicating things because the volumes may not be perfectly additive, but perhaps it's acceptable for an approximate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the concentrations in terms of moles and the solution volume.

So, at 25% titration:

Moles of acetic acid: initial moles (0.001) - moles reacted (0.25 * 0.001) = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Hmm, this is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) which is about 4.74 (since pKa for acetic acid is commonly around 4.76, but let me calculate it more accurately. Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) → log(5.405) is about 0.7328, so pKa ≈ 4.7328. Let's say 4.74 for simplicity.

So pH = 4.74 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263 → approximately 4.26.

Hmm, that's close to option A's first value, 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will be basic.

The moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL = 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻

The Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

To find the pH, we can use the formula for a weak base:

OH⁻ concentration = sqrt(Kb * C)

C is 0.02 M.

So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

Then, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

So pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH around 9.02 at equivalence. Let me check the options again:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → nope.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92 → 6.92 is lower than what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption about the solution being 0.02 M is correct, but maybe I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation for the equivalence point.

At equivalence, the volume is 40 mL (original solution) + 10 mL NaOH = 50 mL. Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O → CH3COOH + OH⁻

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO⁻]

Assuming x is the [OH-], and since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) → approximately 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is about 0.017, so 1.04e-5 → 5 - 0.017 = 4.983.

pH = 14 - 4.983 = 9.017.

But none of the options have a pH near 9.02. Let's see the options again.

Option A: equivalence pH is 8.52 → which is lower than 9, so maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the solution isn't 0.02 M. Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, when we add NaOH, the volume increases beyond 40 mL. So if 10 mL of NaOH is added, the total volume is 50 mL. So yes, 0.001 mol in 0.05 L is 0.02 M.

Hmm, but the options don't have 9.02. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the exact expression without approximation.

The Kb expression is x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, which is okay, but perhaps the approximation isn't necessary. Let's compute it more precisely.

x² = 5.405e-1
