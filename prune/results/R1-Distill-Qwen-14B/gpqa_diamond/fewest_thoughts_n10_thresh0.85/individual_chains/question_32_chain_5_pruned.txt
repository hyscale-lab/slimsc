Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the energy when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons, so that's Li-6 maybe? Because Li typically has 3 protons, so 3 neutrons would make the mass number 6, right?

Wait, Li has atomic number 3. So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So its mass is about the same as a carbon-12 nucleus, but wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Or perhaps I should just use the general formula for relativistic energy.

The problem gives the speed as 0.96 times the speed of light, so beta is 0.96. I remember that the energy of a relativistic particle is given by gamma times m c squared. So I need to find gamma for beta = 0.96.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta squared). Let me compute that. Beta is 0.96, so beta squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784), which is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is indeed 0.9216. Subtract from 1: 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 28 *28 is 784, so yes. So gamma is 1/0.28 → approximately 3.57142857... So gamma is about 3.5714.

But wait, what's the mass of the nucleus X? X is Li-6, right? So the mass is the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Since protons and neutrons are approximately the same mass, each about 938 MeV/c². But wait, the exact mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 3*(938.272 + 939.565)/2? Wait, no, each proton is about 938 MeV, neutron about 940 MeV. But I might be overcomplicating it. Alternatively, I can approximate the mass using the average of a nucleon. But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the exact mass.

Wait, wait, another approach: the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me get exact numbers. The proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3 protons would be 3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV. 3 neutrons would be 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV. So total mass is 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. That's 5.633511 GeV
