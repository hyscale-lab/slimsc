Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row as (0 -i) and the second row as (i 0). So first, I should write down what the matrix Ay looks like.

Wait, let me get S right. The first row is 0 and -i, meaning S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Then, c is h/(4π), so Ay = c * S. So substituting c, Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute that matrix. Multiplying each element by c:

Ay = [ [ (h/(4π))*0 , (h/(4π))*(-i) ],
        [ (h/(4π))*i , (h/(4π))*0 ] ]

Simplifying, the first row is [0, -i h/(4π)], and the second row is [i h/(4π), 0]. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0            -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)      0        ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Remember, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So the matrix Ay - λI would be:

[ -λ          -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)    -λ        ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating each term: (-λ)^2 is λ². Then, the product of the off-diagonal terms is [(-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π))]. Let me compute that. Multiplying the constants: (-i)(i) is -(i²) = -(-1) = 1. Then, (h/(4π))^2 is h²/(16π²). So the product is (1) * (h²/(16π²)) = h²/(16π²).

So the determinant equation becomes:

λ² - [ h²/(16π²) ] = 0.

Wait, no, wait. The determinant is (λ²) minus [ (off-diagonal product) ].

Wait, the determinant is (a*d - b*c), where a and d are diagonal elements. So in this case, a= -λ, d= -λ, b= -i h/(4π), c= i h/(4π).

So determinant = (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

So that's λ² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) (h^2/(4π)^2) ) ].

Compute (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the second term is [1 * h²/(16 π²)].

So equation: λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So λ² = h²/(16 π²).

Taking square roots: λ = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, because 16 π² is (4 π)^2, so sqrt(16
