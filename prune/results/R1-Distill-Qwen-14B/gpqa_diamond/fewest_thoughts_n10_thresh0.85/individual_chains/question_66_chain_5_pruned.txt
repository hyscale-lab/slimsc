Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The options given are combinations of these.

First, I remember that the SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it incorporates the Standard Model plus some higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by how they break the symmetry of the Standard Model.

Wait, so what symmetries are part of the Standard Model? Well, the Standard Model has gauge symmetry, like SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1), but the question is about other symmetries like Lorentz, Poincare, etc.

Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. So Poincare implies Lorentz. If an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. But does SMEFT require both?

I think all operators in SMEFT must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, right? Because it incorporates special relativity. So all SMEFT operators must preserve Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes translations, so the operators should respect momentum and energy conservation. SMEFT operators are constructed in a way that maintains these, so I think Poincare symmetry is also respected. So options 1 and 2 must be true.

Now, what about CP and CPT? I know that the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry. For example, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So if the Standard Model already violates CP, then SMEFT operators wouldn't necessarily have to preserve CP symmetry. So operators in SMEFT might break CP if the Standard Model already does. So option 3 (CP) is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. It states that a process can be transformed by charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. Every operator should respect CPT because it's a basic tenet of quantum field theory. So option 4 is a must.

Putting it all together: the required symmetries are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait. Poincare includes Lorentz, so if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So the question is whether both are required or just Poincare.

Wait, the question is which must be respected by all operators. So if an operator respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz too. But the SMEFT operators are written in a way that they're Lorentz invariant because they're part of a relativistic theory. So does their construction imply that they must individually respect Lorentz symmetry? Or is it that the entire theory respects Lorentz, so each operator is Lorentz invariant.

I think each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry because the theory is written in a Lorentz-invariant framework. So both Lorentz and Poincare are required. But wait, maybe Poincare isn't a separate symmetry. Or maybe all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz and translations. Alternatively, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so each operator must be Lorentz-invariant, but maybe not necessarily separately Poincare.

Wait, no. Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation. So if the theory is Poincare-symmetric, it's also Lorentz-symmetric. So if operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So the question is, does the SMEFT require operators to respect Poincare symmetry?

Hmm, the SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so each operator must be Lorentz-invariant. But do they have to respect Poincare? Poincare includes translation symmetry, which is about momentum and energy conservation. SMEFT operators are constructed with operators that are local and renormalizable (in an effective sense), so they should respect momentum conservation, which is part of Poincare. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz.

Wait, but the options are about which are 'musts' for all operators. So if the operators must respect Poincare, that also covers Lorentz. So the correct symmetries are 1 and 2 (Lorentz and Poincare), and 4 (CPT).

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4, and option A is 1 and 2. So which is correct? Are all SMEFT operators required to respect both Lorentz and Poincare, or is Poincare a separate requirement?

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers Lorentz as a subset of Poincare. So if an operator must respect Poincare, then Lorentz symmetry is automatically respected, so the 'musts' are Poincare and CPT.

But the question is about which must be respected. So which of the options is correct.

Wait, the question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So for each operator, must it respect Lorentz, Poincare, etc.?

I think every operator in the SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant because the theory is Lorentz-invariant. Similarly, each operator must be translation-invariant, which is part of Poincare. But wait, operators can be non-local in a way, but
