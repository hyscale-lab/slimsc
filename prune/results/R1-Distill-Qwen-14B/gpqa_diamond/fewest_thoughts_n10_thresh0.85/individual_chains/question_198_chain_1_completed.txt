--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^(n+) or something. But the stability constants are given as β1, β2, etc. So I think each β represents the formation constant for the nth complex. For example, β1 is for the first complex, which is probably [Co(SCN)]^+.

Wait, no. Stability constants, β, are for the formation of each complex step by step. So β1 is the constant for Co(SCN)^(n+), β2 is for the next one, and so on. So, the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^+, [Co(SCN)_3]^(3−?), and [Co(SCN)_4]^(4−?), but I'm not sure about the charges.

Wait, Co is in +2 oxidation state. Each SCN- is -1. So for each complex:

- [Co(SCN)]^+: Co^2+ plus one SCN^- would be charge 2-1 = +1. So the complex is [Co(SCN)]^+.

- [Co(SCN)_2]^0: 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So neutral.

- [Co(SCN)_3]^-: 2+ +3*(-1) = -1.

- [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}: 2+ +4*(-1) = -2.

But the problem mentions 'dithiocyanato' which is two SCN- ligands. So that would correspond to [Co(SCN)_2]^0, right? But wait, the options are about the percentage of the blue complexes. I think the blue ones are the [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) and [Co(SCN)_3]^- complexes. But the problem specifically says 'dithiocyanato', so it's the one with two SCN.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) among all cobalt species. So we need to calculate the fraction of this complex in the solution.

To find the fraction, we can model the distribution of the complexes. The total concentration of cobalt is fixed, so we can use the stability constants to find the distribution of each species.

The formation of complexes occurs stepwise. So the first complex is [CoSCN]^+ with β1 =9. The second is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 with β2=40. The third is [Co(SCN)_3]^- with β3=63. The fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} with β4=16.

Wait, but wait, the formation constants are defined for each step. So, the overall formation constant for the nth complex would be the product of the β's up to that step. Wait, no. Each β is the stepwise constant. So the overall formation constant K for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} would be the product of β1 through βn. Or is it? Because each β is the constant for adding another SCN-.

Wait, no. The stepwise formation constant βn is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: [Co(SCN)_{n-1}]^{2−(n-1)} } + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} }.

So βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [ [Co(SCN)_{n-1}] ] * [SCN^-] )

So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of β1 to βn.

But maybe for calculating the distribution, we can use the stepwise approach.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex in solution, considering all possible complexes. The species present are:

1. Free Co^2+ (no SCN attached)
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ (1 SCN)
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (2 SCN)
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^- (3 SCN)
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (4 SCN)

But wait, the total concentration of Co is 1e-2 M. So the sum of all these species is 1e-2 M.

Wait, but wait, the problem statement says "the total cobalt concentration is c(Co)=1e-2 M". So that includes all the complexes and the free Co^2+.

But wait, the total concentration [Co] is the sum of [Co^2+], [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

So the sum [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = 1e-2 M.

But the solution also has [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Hmm. So to find the fraction of each species, we can use the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand.

The general approach is to set up the distribution of each complex, considering the stepwise formation.

Let me think about the distribution. The fraction of each complex can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, but wait, the denominator isn't just the sum of all the terms up to n. Because the overall stability is the product of each β up to that point.

Alternatively, the fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / D,

where D is the sum of all possible terms for each species, including the free ion.

So D = 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4.

Wait, but wait, the β4 is 16 in this case. Let me write that down.

Given:

β1 =9,

β2=40,

β3=63,

β4=16.

So, each term in D is the product of the previous β's multiplied by [SCN]^n, where n is the number of steps.

So, D would be:

D = 1 + (β1 [SCN^-]) + (β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 ) + (β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 ) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, but wait, the [SCN] is 0.1 M, so let's compute each term.

Compute each term:

Term 0: 1.

Term 1: β1 * [SCN] =9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

Term 2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01= 3.6.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 =9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3.

Wait, 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. (0.1)^3=0.001. So 22680 * 0.001=22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 =9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9 *40=360, 360 *63=22680, 22680 *16= 362,880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001. So 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Wait, but wait, the way the terms are set up: the first term is the free Co^2+, the second is [CoSCN]^+, the third [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

So each term in D corresponds to the numerator for each species.

So D = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let's compute this:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So D is approximately 64.468.

Now, each fraction f_n is (β1...βn [SCN]^n ) / D.

So for each species:

f_0 = 1/D.

f_1 = (β1 [SCN])/ D.

f_2 = (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) / D.

f_3= (β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 ) / D.

f_4= (β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ) / D.

Wait, but wait, the question is specifically about the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. That's the third term in D, which is term2 (since term0 is f0, term1 is f1, etc. Wait, no, term2 is f2, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So the fraction f2 is (β1 β2 [SCN]^2 ) / D = 3.6 /64.468.

Compute 3.6 /64.468.

Let me calculate that: 3.6 divided by 64.468.

Let's see: 64.468 *0.055 is about 3.5457, which is close to 3.6. So approximately 0.05556, which is 5.556%.

Wait, wait that can't be right. Because 3.6 is about 5.56% of 64.468. Because 64.468 * 5.5% is approximately 3.5457, which is near 3.6. So f2 is approximately 5.56%.

But the options given don't have any option around 5%. The closest option is D)16.9%, but that's higher.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Term1: β1[SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40 *0.01= 360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63 *0.001.

Wait, 9 *40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 * 0.0001.

Compute 9*40=360, *63=22680, *16=362,880.

362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So D=1 +0.9=1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468.

So yes, D=64.468.

So f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05556, or 5.56%.

Hmm, but none of the options are near 5.5%. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Wait, wait, maybe I forgot that some complexes are charged, and their concentrations are influenced by their charges? No, I think the way the fractions are calculated already accounts for the ligand concentration, so the fractions are correct as is.

Wait, but the problem states 'the blue dithiocyanato' complexes. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in which complex is blue. Actually, I'm not entirely sure about the colors of the different cobalt thiocyanate complexes. Wait, typically, [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is blue, and [Co(SCN)_3]^− is green, or maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is blue. I'm a bit confused now. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to [Co(SCN)_4]^3- as blue. Wait, I'm not exactly sure, but the question says 'dithiocyanato' which is two SCN, so that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck all the terms.

Term 0: 1.

Term 1: β1 * [SCN] =9*0.1=0.9.

Term2: 9 *40 * (0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3: 9*40*63*(0.1)^3 = (9*40)=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4: 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880; 362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So D=1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So f2=3.6/64.468≈0.05556, about 5.56%.

But the options are much higher.

Wait a minute! Oh wait, perhaps I miscalculated the D value.

Wait, let me recompute D.

D = 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

1 +0.9 is 1.9.

1.9 +3.6 is 5.5.

5.5 +22.68 is 28.18.

28.18 +36.288 is 64.468.

Wait, that's correct. So the f2 is approximately 5.56%, which is indeed 5.56%, but none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait another thought: maybe I should compute the fractions correctly because the stability constants are stepwise, but perhaps the overall formation constants are different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the fraction with two SCN ligands, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but perhaps the calculation is different.

Wait, another approach: the distribution of complexes can be found using the formula for the fraction of each species.

The fraction f_n for the nth complex is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^n [β1 β2...βk [SCN]^k } )

So, for n=2, f2 is (β1 β2 [SCN]^2 ) / D, where D is the sum up to n=4.

So, f2 = 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 5.56%, which is not in the options. But the options are much higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the denominator. Or maybe the problem is using the overall formation constant for each complex.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the possible complexes and their formation constants.

The overall formation constant K for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} is the product of β1 through βn.

So,

K1 = β1 =9.

K2 = β1 * β2 =9*40=360.

K3=9*40*63=22680.

K4=9*40*63*16=362880.

But wait, the formation constants are for each step, but perhaps the fraction is calculated differently.

Wait, the fraction of the nth complex is given by:

f_n = ( [L]^n * K_n ) / (1 + sum_{i=1}^n [L]^i K_i )

But wait, I'm not sure. Another approach is to consider that the fraction of each species is proportional to the product of all previous β's and [SCN]^n.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to model each species as follows.

The concentration of [Co(SCN)_n] is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = K_n * [Co^2+] * [SCN]^n / (1 + sum_{i=0}^n K_i [SCN]^i )

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the species distribution using the formation constants.

Alternatively, another approach is to write the formation of each complex as:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}, with K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So, the fraction of each complex is K_n [SCN]^n / (1 + sum_{k=0}^4 K_k [SCN]^k )

But wait, K_0 is 1, since it's the free ion.

So, the denominator D would be sum_{k=0}^4 K_k [SCN]^k.

Wait, K_0=1, K_1=9, K_2=360, K_3=22680, K4=362880.

So D = 1 + 9*(0.1) + 360*(0.1)^2 + 22680*(0.1)^3 +362880*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

1 =1.

9 *0.1=0.9.

360 *0.01=3.6.

22680 *0.001=22.68.

362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Add them up: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

So, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is K_2 [SCN]^2 / D.

Which is (360*(0.1)^2 ) /64.468.

360 *0.01=3.6. So 3.6/64.468≈0.05556, which is about 5.56%.

But the options are way higher. So I'm getting 5.56%, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, is there another way to approach this? Maybe the stability constants are given for the overall complexes, not stepwise.

Wait, no, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. So each β is the stepwise constant, not the overall.

Wait, but perhaps the way I’ve calculated the fractions is incorrect. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the overall formation constants differently. For example, perhaps β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. So the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be (β1 β2 [SCN]^2 ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is the same as before, so f2=3.6/64.468≈5.56%.

But that's not matching any options. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of all the dithiocyanato complexes, which includes [Co(SCN)_2]^0 and [Co(SCN)_3]^-? No, the question specifies dithiocyanato, which I thought was two ligands. But maybe the question is about tetra? No, the term dithiocyanato suggests two.

Wait, maybe the question is about the overall concentration of all possible dithiocyanato complexes, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor because the solution includes both the free Co^2+ and all the complexes, and the question is asking the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex in the total.

But according to my calculation, the percentage is about 5.56%, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, let me compute each term more accurately.

Compute term0: 1.

Term1: β1 [SCN]=9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2: 9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3:9*40*63*(0.1)^3= (9*40)=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*(0.1)^3=22.68.

Term4:9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001.

362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So D=1+0.9+3.6+22.68+36.288.

Adding:

1+0.9=1.9.

1.9+3.6=5.5.

5.5+22.68=28.18.

28.18+36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but in solution, some of it is consumed by the complexes. But I think the approximation used in the calculation assumes that the free [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. But perhaps I should account for the change in [SCN^-] due to complexation. But I think that would complicate things, and unless the fraction is very small, it might not make a big difference. But in this case, the fraction of the complexes is small, so perhaps the [SCN] is approximately 0.1 M.

Wait, but maybe I need to consider the change in free [SCN^-] due to complex formation. Hmm, that's a more accurate approach, but it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to use the formula for the fraction of each species, which is:

f_n = ( [SCN^-]^n * K_n ) / (1 + sum_{i=1}^4 [SCN^-]^i K_i )

Where K_n is the overall formation constant for each complex.

So, for the dithiocyanato complex, n=2, K_2=9*40=360.

So, the fraction f2 = (0.1^2 * 360) / (1 + 9*0.1 + 360*0.01 + 22680*0.001 + 362880*0.0001 )

Which is (0.01 *360) / (1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 )

So 3.6 /64.468= 0.05556, same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_4]^3- instead. Because I've heard that the tetra complex is blue.

Wait, the question says "the blue dithiocyanato", which is confusing. Dithiocyanato is two, but the blue color is perhaps in the tetra complex. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the term 'dithiocyanato' wrong. Wait, maybe the term refers to the tetra? No, dithiocyanato is two. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a typo and refers to the tetra. Or perhaps the question refers to the two SCN ligands but the blue complex is a different one.

Wait, perhaps I should instead calculate all possible species and see which one has the highest fraction.

So,

f0 =1/64.468≈0.01551 (1.55%).

f1=0.9/64.468≈0.01396 (1.396%).

f2=3.6/64.468≈0.05556 (5.556%).

f3=22.68/64.468≈0.3518 (35.18%).

f4=36.288/64.468≈0.563 (56.3%).

So the major species is the tetra complex, followed by the tri, then the di, then the mono, and then the free Co^2+.

So the percentages are:

f0= ~1.55%

f1= ~1.4%

f2= ~5.56%

f3= ~35.18%

f4= ~56.3%

So the sum is 1.55 +1.4 +5.56 +35.18 +56.3=100% approximately.

So the major species is the tetra complex at ~56%, and the [Co(SCN)_3]^- is ~35%.

But the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm getting the di as about 5.5%, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the sum of [Co(SCN)_2] and [Co(SCN)_3] for some reason. But the question is specific about dithiocyanato, which is two.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Maybe the β values are in a different order or the complexes are different.

Wait, perhaps the β values are for the overall complexes, not stepwise. If that's the case, then the calculation would be different.

Wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. So each is a stepwise constant.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} to the sum of all species. Because in that case, the fraction would be 56.3%, but that's not one of the options either.

Wait, looking at the options, 38.1% is option C. Hmm, in the calculations, [Co(SCN)_3]^- is 35%, which is close to 38.1% but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K3 or K4.

Wait, K3 is β1 * β2 * β3, which is 9 *40 *63 = 22680.

K4 is β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 = 9*40*63*16= 362880.

Wait, but term4 is K4 * [SCN]^4 = 362880 * (0.1)^4 =362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

But perhaps in the denominator, the sum is [1 + β1 [SCN] + (β1β2) [SCN]^2 + (β1β2β3)[SCN]^3 + (β1β2β3β4) [SCN]^4 ].

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, so if the question is about the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex, then its fraction is f3=22.68/64.468≈0.3518, 35.18%.

Which is close to option C, 38.1%. But not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is approximate. Let me compute 22.68 /64.468.

Let me do that division:

22.68 ÷64.468.

So 64.468 ×0.35 = 22.5638.

Which is close to 22.68. So approximately 0.352, which is 35.2%. So that's about 35%, but the closest option is C)38.1%.

Hmm, but I'm not getting any of the given options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait a minute, perhaps the [SCN^-] is not 0.1 M but higher? No, the problem states the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the logarithms or some other form. No, the setup is as it is.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex relative to all the complexes, not considering the free Co^2+. But that doesn't make sense because the question says "among all cobalt containing species," which includes all complexes and the free Co^2+.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the dimer or another form. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another way to compute the fraction.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the fraction of the nth species as:

f_n = ( [SCN]^n * K_n ) / (1 + sum_{k=1}^n [SCN]^k K_k )

where K_n is the overall formation constant for the nth complex.

So, in this case, for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, n=2, K2=360.

So:

f2 = [ (0.1)^2 *360 ] / [ 1 + (0.1 *9) + (0.01 *360) + (0.001 *22680) + (0.0001 *362880) ]

Which is the same as before: 3.6 /64.468≈5.56%, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using different β values. For example, perhaps β4 is the overall formation constant for the tetra complex, not the stepwise. But the problem says the stability constants are β1, β2, etc., so they're stepwise.

Hmm. I'm stuck. None of the calculations are matching the given options. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, maybe the stability constants are given in a different order. Like, β1 is for [Co(SCN)_4]^3-? No, that can't be right because β1 is the first step.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but some of it is consumed in the complexes. So the free [SCN^-] is less than 0.1 M. But that complicates the calculations, and I think for the purposes of this problem, the approximation is made that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the charge balance. But that's another level of complexity, and perhaps the problem doesn't require that.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement once more.

The problem says the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M.

The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the β4 is the stepwise constant for adding a fourth SCN, but perhaps it's a lower value than the previous ones, which would decrease the fraction of the higher complexes. But I think that's the case; in my calculation, the fraction of the tetra complex is higher than the tri.

Wait, but according to the calculation earlier, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is the major species, at around 56%.

But the options don't include that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A)42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So none of these correspond to 5.5% or 35%. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of D.

Wait, perhaps I should compute D more precisely.

Let me compute each term more accurately.

Compute each term:

Term0: 1.

Term1:9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2:9 *40 *0.01=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3:9*40*63 *0.001.

9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4:9*40*63*16 *0.0001.

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880, 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So D=1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering only the first three complexes, [Co], [CoSCN], and [Co(SCN)_2], ignoring the others. But I don't see why that would be the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the concentration of the complexes in a different way. For example, perhaps the problem is using the conditional formation constant, which accounts for the ligand concentration.

Wait, the conditional formation constant K' is given by K' = β * α, where α is the fraction of the ligand that is free.

But I think that's more applicable when the ligand is in excess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fraction of the ligand that is free.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the distribution of Co species considering all possible complexes.

But I'm stuck. I can't see where the error is, but perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 and [Co(SCN)_3]^- combined, which would be 5.56% +35.18% =40.74%, which is closest to option A)42.3%.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the fractions.

Another possibility: perhaps the stability constants are given in reverse order. Suppose that β1=16, β2=63, β3=40, β4=9. Then the calculations would be different. But the problem states β1=9, etc., so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) and see if any of the options match. But according to the calculations, it's about 5.56%, which isn't an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using a different approach where the fraction is calculated without considering all the terms beyond n=2. That is, assuming that higher-order complexes are negligible. Let's try that.

So, compute D as 1 +0.9 +3.6=5.5.

Then f2=3.6 /5.5 ≈0.6545, 65.45%.

But that's not matching any option.

Wait, but 3.6/(1+0.9+3.6) =3.6/5.5≈65.45%. That's even higher than the options given.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is about the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex, which is 35.18%. The closest option is C)38.1%.

But that's not matching exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractions more accurately.

Wait, let me compute the exact fraction for [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

f3=22.68 /64.468.

Compute 22.68 ÷64.468.

Let me compute this:

64.468 × 0.3518=22.68.

So 0.3518 is 35.18%, but none of the options match.

But option C is 38.1%, which is close to 35.18% but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects using only up to the third term.

Wait, let me recompute D with only up to term3.

D=1+0.9+3.6+22.68=28.18.

So f3=22.68 /28.18=0.805, 80.5%.

But that's not the case either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex in the presence of lower-order complexes but not higher. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula where the fraction is calculated as (β1β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 ), ignoring higher complexes.

So,

f2 =3.6 / (1+0.9+3.6)=3.6/5.5≈0.6545, 65.45%.

But that's higher than the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is 35.2%, which is closest to option C)38.1%, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractions.

Wait, perhaps I should recount the fractions.

Wait,

f0 =1/64.468≈0.01551 (1.55%)

f1=0.9/64.468≈0.01396 (1.40%)

f2=3.6/64.468≈0.05556 (5.56%)

f3=22.68/64.468≈0.3518 (35.18%)

f4=36.288/64.468≈0.563 (56.3%)

So the sum is 1.55+1.40+5.56+35.18+56.3=100%.

So, for the dithiocyanato complex, it's 5.56%, which is not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the percentage of the di- and trithiocyanato complexes.

So, 5.56% +35.18% =40.74%, which is approximately 40.7%. The closest option is A)42.3%, but that's not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the sum of all possible complexes except free Co^2+. So, 100% -1.55% =98.45%. But that's not helpful.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stability constants are given in a different order. For instance, perhaps β1 is for [Co(SCN)_4]^3- and β4 is for [CoSCN]^+.

But I think that's unlikely, as the problem states β1=9, β2=40, etc.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the sum of all possible dithiocyanato and higher complexes. That would be f2 +f3 +f4 =5.56+35.18+56.3=97.04%. No, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the first two complexes, ignoring the others. But that would give f2=3.6/(1+0.9+3.6)=3.6/5.5≈65.45%, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach to calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex.

Wait, another approach: the distribution of the species can be found using the equation for each step.

The fraction of [Co(SCN)_n] is given by:

f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + sum_{k=1}^n K_k [SCN]^k )

Where K_n is the overall formation constant for the nth complex.

So, K1=9, K2=360, K3=22680, K4=362880.

So, for n=2, f2= K2 [SCN]^2 / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

= (360 * 0.01 ) / 64.468 =3.6/64.468=0.05556 (5.56%).

But again, no option matches.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is using the logarithmic form or considering that the [SCN] is not 0.1 M because some is bound in the complexes. But that would require solving for the free [SCN], which complicates the matter.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a simplified approach where higher-order complexes are ignored beyond the dithiocyanato.

So, compute f2 as 3.6 / (1 +0.9+3.6 )=3.6/5.5≈65.45%. That's not an option.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe the answer is option C)38.1%, but I can't see how that would fit.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex among all complexes except the free Co^2+.

So, the sum of f1 to f4 is 100% -1.55% =98.45%.

The fraction of f2 is 5.56% of the total, so 5.56 /98.45 =5.64%, which is even less.

No, that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator. Let me recompute D.

Compute each term again:

1) 1.

2)9*0.1=0.9.

3)9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

4)9*40*63*(0.1)^3= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *0.001=22.68.

5)9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16=362880, 362880*0.0001=36.288.

So D=1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue complex, which is actually the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex, which is 35.18%. Closest option is C)38.1%, but that's not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation without considering β4, which would make D=28.18.

So, [Co(SCN)_3]^- fraction is 22.68/28.18≈0.805, 80.5%.

But that's not matching any option either.

I'm really stuck here. Based on the calculations, the correct percentage for the dithiocyanato complex is about 5.56%, but none of the options match. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but about [Co(SCN)_4]^3-.

In that case, the fraction is 36.288/64.468≈0.563, 56.3%. But none of the options match.

Hmm, perhaps I should give up and look for another approach.

Wait, I think I must have made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think about this again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula where the fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = ( [SCN]^n * β1 β2 ... βn ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 [SCN]^k * (β1 β2 ... βk) ) )

Which is the same as before.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the exact decimal values to more precision.

Compute D:

1 =1.0

0.9=0.9

3.6=3.6

22.68=22.68

36.288=36.288.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So, D=64.468.

f2=3.6 /64.468.

Compute 3.6 divided by 64.468.

Let me compute this:

64.468 * 0.055 =3.54574.

Which is close to 3.6, so 0.05556, 5.556%.

No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option D)16.9%, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the stability constants are given in a different order. For example, perhaps β1 is for the tetra complex. Then the calculation would be different.

If β1=16 (for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-), β2=63, β3=40, β4=9.

But the problem states β1=9, so that can't be.

I'm really stuck. Based on the calculations, I think the correct answer is approximately 5.56%, but since that's not an option, perhaps I have to choose the closest option, which is option D)16.9%. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the first two terms. So D=1+0.9+3.6=5.5.

Then f2=3.6/5.5=0.6545, which is 65.45%, but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the fraction of the di complex in the free SCN solution, but I can't see how.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the presence of other species, such as the hexaaqua complex. But the problem states that the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, so I assume that the only species are the ones with SCN ligands.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the hexaaqua complex as the primary species, but the question states that the solution contains thiocyanate, so I think that's not the case.

At this point, I'm not able to reconcile the calculations with the given options. Perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C)38.1%, but I'm not certain.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and ligand concentration. The total cobalt concentration is \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the thiocyanate concentration is \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The stability constants are \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \).

### Key Steps:
1. **Species Distribution**: The cobalt species present are:
   - Free \( \text{Co}^{2+} \),
   - \( [\text{CoSCN}]^+ \),
   - \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0 \),
   - \( [\text{Co(SCN)_3}]^- \),
   - \( [\text{Co(SCN)_4}]^{2-} \).

   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species.

2. **Fraction of Each Species**: The fraction of each species is proportional to the product of the stability constants and the ligand concentration raised to the power of the number of ligands. The denominator, \( D \), is the sum of all terms representing the contributions of each species:
   \[
   D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]

3. **Calculation of \( D \)**:
   - \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \),
   - \( \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 3.6 \),
   - \( \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 22.68 \),
   - \( \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 36.288 \).

   Adding these terms:
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468
   \]

4. **Fraction of \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0 \)**:
   The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0 \) is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D} = \frac{3.6}{64.468} \approx 0.05556 \, \text{or} \, 5.56\%.
   \]

5. **Other Fractions**:
   - \( f_0 = \frac{1}{64.468} \approx 1.55\% \),
   - \( f_1 = \frac{0.9}{64.468} \approx 1.40\% \),
   - \( f_3 = \frac{22.68}{64.468} \approx 35.18\% \),
   - \( f_4 = \frac{36.288}{64.468} \approx 56.3\% \).

6. **Analysis of Options**:
   - The calculated fraction for \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0 \) is \( 5.56\% \), which does not match any of the given options.
   - The closest option to the calculated value for \( [\text{Co(SCN)_3}]^- \) (35.18%) is \( 38.1\% \) (Option C).

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is approximately \( 5.56\% \), but since this is not an option, the closest match is \( 38.1\% \), which corresponds to the \( [\text{Co(SCN)_3}]^- \) complex.

Answer: C
