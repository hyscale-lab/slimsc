Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It goes through several steps, and I need to figure out the final product's NMR coupling pattern. Hmm, let me break it down.

First step: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 has specific signals: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Also, there's an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. So, what's happening here?

I remember that when vicinal dihalides (halides on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on carbons 1 and 3. Oh wait, no, that's not adjacent. For elimination, the bromines need to be on adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution, but with two leaving groups.

Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination, but with such structure. Let me think about adamantane's structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1 and 3 are adjacent in some way. Wait, no—the structure of adamantane is such that each carbon is part of a chair-like structure. Wait, perhaps the two bromines are on adjacent positions, making it a vicinal dihalide, which would eliminate to form an alkene.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—could that be adjacent? Because in adamantane, each carbon is connected to two others in a diamond structure. So perhaps the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, making a 1,2-dibromo structure? No, the name is 1,3, so maybe they're not adjacent. Hmm, confusion arises.

Wait, maybe the reaction is more about substitution. But if KOH is used in excess and heat, maybe it's an E2 elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond. Let's think about the product.

The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator. That's a carbonyl group, like a ketone, because ketones have strong absorption around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So product 1 has a ketone group. That suggests that the reaction is some kind of oxidation or elimination forming a carbonyl.

Wait, but KOH is a base. How does that lead to a ketone? Maybe the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where two bromides are replaced by something else. Wait, but KOH would be a nucleophile. Oh wait, maybe it's a double elimination where two molecules of HBr are lost, and the structure forms a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH could form a cyclic intermediate. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-type elimination. Wait, pinacol is a 1,2-diol that eliminates water to form a ketone. But here, it's a dihalide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double E2 elimination, losing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond.

Wait, but the product has a ketone. So maybe the reaction forms a ketone via elimination and possible ring opening or rearrangement.

Alternatively, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH can undergo a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene. But that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure of adamantane is such that upon elimination, a bridge breaks, leading to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that usually gives alkenes, not ketones.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 1. The signals are 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably a CH₂ group next to something deshielded, maybe an oxygen, like an ether or a carbonyl. The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) could be multiple CH₂ groups in a rigid structure, perhaps adamantane derivatives. The 1.94 ppm (2H) is another CH₂ group, maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, like a ketone. So product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a ketone group.

So, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, where two bromides are removed, and the ring structure rearranges to form a ketone.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a Dieckmann elimination, but that's for cyclic esters, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, could the reaction be a substitution leading to a geminal diol, but that would require two OH groups. Wait, but with KOH, maybe it's more likely to form an ether. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane allows for a double elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, losing two HBr molecules and forming a bridge that leads to a ketone.

Wait, another angle: The NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That might be a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. Because in the case of a carbonyl, the adjacent CH₂ would have protons that are deshielded, so they appear around 4-5 ppm. For example, acetone has a CH3 group at around 2.1 ppm
