Okay, so I have this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and photon momentum. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question says that we have a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They're modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state.

The given data are:
- Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency (ω) = 4e14 rad/s

The options are A to D, each with different momentum values.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the model. The rotation-vibration model combines both rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state would be the state with the lowest possible energy, which I think is the ground state where both rotation and vibration are in their lowest energy levels.

So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. But for a diatomic molecule, which transition requires less energy? Well, vibrational energy levels are quantized in much larger steps than rotational ones. So maybe the next state is a vibrational excitation, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the molecule might transition from a lower rotational state to a higher one while remaining in the same vibrational state.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." That makes me think of the next energy level overall. So perhaps the molecule is in the ground state of vibration (n=0) and ground rotational state (J=0). The next state could be the first excited rotational state (J=1) or the first excited vibrational state (n=1). But which one is lower in energy?

I remember that the vibrational energy spacing is larger than rotational. For example, the vibrational energy levels are given by (n+1/2)ħω, while rotational are (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. So the energy difference between vibrational levels is ħω, which for ω=4e14 rad/s would be ħ * 4e14. Let me compute that. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is about 1.055e-34 J·s. Multiply by 4e14 gives 4.22e-20 J. 

Now for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1. The energy difference is (J=1)(J+1=2) times ħ²/(2I) minus J=0. So the energy difference is [ (1)(2) - 0 ] * ħ²/(2I) = (2)(ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I). 

What is the moment of inertia I for the diatomic molecule? I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. Right, the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). So Mx
