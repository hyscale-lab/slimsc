Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed, but I think this question is about the relativistic case, so things are a bit different. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are labeled A to D, and the speed of light is c.

Wait, in the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is v_max = sqrt(kA/m). That's one of the options here—option C. But this is a relativistic problem, so I can't use the classical formula directly.

Relativistic mechanics comes into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, so I need to consider the effects of special relativity. The energy in relativity is given by E = gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the oscillator is both relativistic and a harmonic oscillator. So I should think about how the potential and kinetic energies balance.

In the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. Classically, at maximum displacement (amplitude A), all energy is potential, and at equilibrium (x=0), all energy is kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore; it's (gamma -1) mc². Hmm.

Wait, the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². So in the classical case, the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic scenario, when the mass is at maximum displacement, the potential energy would be (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy would be zero because it's at rest (changing direction). But wait, that doesn't seem right because at A, velocity is zero, so kinetic is zero. But when it's at x=0, maximum velocity, the potential energy is zero, and kinetic is E. But
