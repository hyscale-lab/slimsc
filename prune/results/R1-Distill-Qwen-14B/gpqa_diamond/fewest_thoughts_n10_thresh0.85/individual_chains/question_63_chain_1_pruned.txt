Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, the question is about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. So, the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, I might be mixing that up. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor is another name for the vibration-rotation model, where the bond can stretch slightly.

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be when both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their minimum. For the vibrational state, that's n=0, and for rotational, that's J=0.

Now, the question is about what momentum an absorbed photon should have to switch the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, the next state with the lowest energy—so that would be the next higher energy state. But in quantum systems, transitions are quantized, so the photon has to supply exactly the energy difference between the initial and final states.

Wait, but the molecule can change both rotation and vibration. Oh, wait, the question says it's the "next state" in terms of energy, so the lowest possible higher energy state. So, what quantum numbers would that be?

Let me think. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the vibration-rotation model are given by a combination of vibrational and rotational energies. The energy for vibration is quantized as (n + 1/2) ħω, and rotational energy is (J (J+1) ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the total energy is the sum of these. So, the fundamental state is n=0, J=0.

What's the next state? It could be either increasing n by 1 (n=1, J=0) or increasing J by 1 (n=0, J=1), whichever has lower energy. Because the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, we need to find which transition requires less energy.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and we want the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's the first excited state, which could be either vibrational or rotational. But which one is lower in energy? The rotational or vibrational excitation.

I remember that vibrational energy levels are generally higher than rotational ones for diatomic molecules. Because the spacing between rotational levels is smaller than the spacing between vibrational levels. So perhaps the lowest energy transition is a rotational one. So, the molecule would go from J=0 to J=1, keeping n=0.

Wait, but wait. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. The next state could be either the first vibrational excited state (n=1, J=0) or the first rotational excited state (n=0, J=1). Which of these has a lower energy difference from the ground state?

Let me calculate the energies. The energy difference between n=0, J=0 and n=0, J=1. And between n=0, J=0 and n=1, J=0.

So, let me find the vibrational energy difference first. The vibrational energy when n=1 is (1 + 1/2)ħω - (0 + 1/2)ħω = ħω. So ΔE_vib = ħω.

The rotational energy difference when J=1: The rotational energy is [J (J+1) - 0] * (ħ²/(2I)). So, for J=1, it's [2 - 0] * (ħ²/(2I)) = 2*(ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So the rotational energy difference is ħ²/(I).

We need to compare ħω and ħ²/(I). Which is smaller?

I can compute both values numerically.

Wait, the given data includes:

Masses Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

Bond length R=2 angstroms.

Angular frequency w=4e14 rad/s.

So, let's calculate I first. The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but we need to convert that into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let me compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 is about 3.017. So μ ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculating (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m². So I = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational energy difference is ħ²/(I). ħ is h/(2π), and Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Then, ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2068e-46 ≈ 9.213e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, 1.112e-68 divided by 1.2068e-46 is (1.112 / 1.2068) * 1e-22, because 1e-68 /1e-46 is 1e-22. So 1.112/1.2068 is about 0.921, so 0.921e-22 J, which is 9.21e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is ħω. Let's compute that.

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

So comparing the two, the rotational transition requires about 9.21e-23 J, and the vibrational is 4.218e-20 J. So the rotational transition is smaller in energy. So the next state the molecule can go to with the lowest possible energy would be the rotational state, J=1, n=0.

Wait, but wait. The question asks for the photon momentum. So we're looking for the photon that provides the energy difference for this transition.

The energy of the photon is E = ΔE, which for the rotational transition is 9.21e-23 J. But wait, the problem statement is about momentum. The momentum of a photon is p = E/c, where c is the speed of light.

Wait, but wait. Photon momentum p is E divided by c, yes. Because E = pc, so p = E/c.

So the photon must have energy E equal to the rotational energy difference. So E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

Thus, p_photon = E_photon / c = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s).

Let me compute that. 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = (9.21 /3) * 1e-31 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait a second. The options provided are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s. Wait, 1 N·s is 1 kg·m/s, so the units are correct. But my calculation gives 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is much smaller than any of the options.

Hmm, this suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back and check my calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the energy difference for the rotational transition. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the rotational energy for a given J is given by E_rot = (J (J +1) ) * (ħ²/(2I)).

So when J=0, E_rot =0. When J=1, E_rot = (1*2) * (ħ²/(2I)) = 2 * (ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

So E_rot = ħ²/I.

But wait, I thought to find the energy difference between J=0 and J=1, which is E_rot for J=1 minus J=0, which is ħ²/I.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the moment of inertia calculation.

Wait, I = μ R².

μ is the reduced mass. Let me recalculate μ.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2)
