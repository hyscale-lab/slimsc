Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about organic chemistry reactions and the resulting NMR spectra. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule, kind of like a cage structure. 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction here. Since there are two bromine atoms, perhaps dehydrohalogenation occurs twice, removing both Br atoms and forming a double bond. Wait, but adamantane is already a very strained structure, so maybe it's more about forming a cyclopropane or something else? Oh wait, wait. No, when you have two vicinal bromides (adjacent Brs), like in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH would lead to the formation of an alkene via elimination. So, each Br leaves, and two Hs are abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-didehydroadamantane, which is an adamantane with a double bond between C1 and C3. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so where exactly would the double bond form?

Wait, the NMR data for product 1 is given. The 1H NMR has signals at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. Hmm. Wait, IR peak at 1720 is usually a carbonyl group, like a ketone (C=O). But product 1 comes from the elimination reaction with KOH. Wait, that would form an alkene, not a ketone. Did I get that right?

Wait, maybe the reaction is not elimination but something else. Another possibility is dehydrohalogenation but maybe forming a diepoxide or something. No, KOH usually isn't for epoxidation. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to an elimination, but if two Brs are present, maybe it's a di-elimination.

Wait, but the IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. Hmm, how?

Wait a minute, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and it's treated with KOH, could it be a nucleophilic substitution? But since it's vicinal (two adjacent Br atoms), perhaps it's a double SN2 reaction? But that would require a good leaving group and a structure that allows for that. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination, but then why the carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the base is causing the Brs to leave and
