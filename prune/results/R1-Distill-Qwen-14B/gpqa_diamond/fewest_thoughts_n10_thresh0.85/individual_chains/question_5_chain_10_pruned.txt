Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied, right?

Wait, the operator is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, the operator P itself must be a combination of these components in the direction n. Oh wait, right! The operator P is along some arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be written in terms of spherical coordinates, maybe. Let me think: since it's in the x-z plane, the angle phi (the azimuthal angle) would be zero or 180 degrees, or maybe any multiple? Wait no, wait. The x-z plane is the plane where y=0. So any direction in the x-z plane would have its direction vector in the form (l, 0, m), where l and m are the direction cosines, and l^2 + m^2 =1. So the direction could be represented by theta, the polar angle, measured from the z-axis, and phi would be zero or perhaps varying but in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi? Hmm, perhaps the general direction is given by theta, the angle from the z-axis, and phi=0. Because in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle is zero.

Wait, but I'm not sure. The direction vector n is along some direction in x-z, which I can write as n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in the x-z plane, phi can be any angle? No, wait, no, the x-z plane is where y=0, so the direction vector can be in any direction where y component is zero. So phi is either 0 or pi, because for the x-z plane, it's like being at the equator in the direction where y=0. Wait no, when you're on the x-z plane, like the equator in the standard spherical coordinate system, phi is 90 degrees. Wait, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle from the positive z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle from the positive x-axis in the xy-plane. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the projection onto the y-axis is zero. So any point in x-z plane would have y=0. So for a direction vector in x-z plane, the phi can be 0 or pi, because cos(phi) would be 1 or -1, but that's not right. Wait, if I have a point in the x-z plane, that means its y-component is zero. So in spherical coordinates, the point would have theta as the angle from the z-axis, and phi as 0 or pi, because in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle would be along the x-axis. For example, along the x-axis, phi=0; along the negative x-axis, phi=pi. So if the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, I can write the direction vector as n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in the x-z plane, perhaps phi is 0 for simplicity? Or maybe not, because the problem says "arbitrary direction in x-z plane" so phi could be any value, but for the purposes of this problem, n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so perhaps we can just parameterize it with theta and phi, but for the eigenvector, perhaps the specific angles don't matter, and the eigenvector can be expressed in terms of theta and phi.

But wait, I'm supposed to find the normalized eigenvector. So first, I need to figure out the operator P along direction n.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z, but in the direction of n, which is in the x-z plane. So the operator in the direction of n would be P·n. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But n is in the x-z plane, so n_y = 0. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, in terms of these, P_n is:

P_n = (n_x) * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z) * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 (because n is a unit vector), right?

So P_n would be (ħ/2) times [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, let me compute that correctly:

Wait, n_x * P_x matrix is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]], multiplied by ħ/2.

n_z * P_z matrix is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]], multiplied by ħ/2.

So adding them together:

P_n = (ħ/2) * ( [n_z, 0] [0, -n_z] )? No wait, no. Let me re-add:

Wait, P_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by ħ/2, so P_x = (ħ/2)(σ_x), where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Similarly, P_z is (ħ/2)(σ_z).

So P_n = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z )

So, the matrix for P_n is (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So n_x σ_x is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]], and n_z σ_z is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]. Adding them together, the matrix becomes:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So P_n = (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Now, the problem is to find the eigenvector of P_n corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, we set up the eigenvalue equation: P_n |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Let me write this out. Let me denote |v> as a column vector [a; b], where a and b are complex numbers.

So,

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a'; b']

Which implies that:

[ [n_z a + n_x b ] = ( (ħ/2) ) a' ?

Wait, no, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = λ |v>, where λ is the eigenvalue. So in this case, λ is +ħ/2.

So,

(ħ/2) * ( [n_z a + n_x b], [n_x a - n_z b] ) = (ħ/2) [a'; b']

Wait, no, let me be precise. The matrix multiplication is:

First component: n_z * a + n_x * b

Second component: n_x * a - n_z * b

So, the equation is:

(ħ/2) [n_z a + n_x b, n_x a - n_z b]^T = (ħ/2) [a'; b'].

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2), so:

[n_z a + n_x b, n_x a - n_z b]^T = [a'; b']

But since |v> is an eigenvector, we have:

[n_z a + n_x b ] = λ a' = (ħ/2) a'

Similarly,

[n_x a - n_z b ] = (ħ/2) b'

Wait, no. Wait, because the eigenvalue equation is:

P_n |v> = λ |v>

So, [n_z a + n_x b] = λ a

[n_x a - n_z b] = λ b

So, the equations are:

n_z a + n_x b = λ a     ...(1)

n_x a - n_z b = λ b     ...(2)

Substituting λ = ħ/2, we get:

n_z a + n_x b = (ħ/2) a     ...(1a)

n_x a - n_z b = (ħ/2) b     ...(2a)

Now, I can rearrange these equations.

From equation (1a):

n_z a + n_x b = (ħ/2) a

=> (n_z - ħ/2) a + n_x b = 0       ...(1b)

Similarly, from equation (2a):

n_x a - n_z b = (ħ/2) b

=> n_x a + (-n_z - ħ/2) b = 0     ...(2b)

So, we have a system of two equations:

(n_z - ħ/2) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a + (-n_z - ħ/2) b = 0

Since the system has non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

Alternatively, we can consider the ratio between a and b.

Assuming a ≠ 0 (if a is zero, then from equation (1b), n_x b =0, but that's another case), let's express the first equation as:

[ (n_z - ħ/2) a ] + [n_x b ] = 0

Divide both sides by a (since a ≠0):

(n_z - ħ/2) + n_x (b/a) = 0

Let me let k = b/a. Then,

(n_z - ħ/2) + n_x k = 0

=> k = (ħ/2 - n_z) / n_x

Similarly, from the second equation (2b):

n_x a + (-n_z - ħ/2) b =0

Divide by a:

n_x + (-n_z - ħ/2) (b/a) =0

=> n_x + (-n_z - ħ/2) k =0

Substitute k from above:

n_x + (-n_z - ħ/2) [ (ħ/2 - n_z) / n_x ] = 0

Multiply both sides by n_x to eliminate denominator:

n_x^2 + (-n_z - ħ/2)( ħ/2 - n_z ) = 0

Let me compute (-n_z - ħ/2)( ħ/2 -n_z )

= [ - (n_z +
