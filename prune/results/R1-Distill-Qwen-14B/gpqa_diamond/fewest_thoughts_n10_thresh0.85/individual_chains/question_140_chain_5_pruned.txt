Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm. I'll try to break this down step by step.

First, let's think about what X could be. Since X is a reagent in organic chemistry, maybe it's something common like a strong base or a metal. One thought is that it's sodium metal or another alkali metal because those are often used in reactions. But wait, the question says it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe it's an element with isotopes, like chlorine or something else.

The reaction with liquid Y is violent, producing gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That suggests a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Common gases include H2 (but 1 proton and 1 neutron per H, but H doesn't have a neutron in its isotope... Wait, maybe CO2? No, that's a gas but doesn't fit the same number. Or maybe NH3? No, that's a gas but again, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like O2 or N2. Wait, O2 has 8 protons each, so each molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons (for O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in total? Or wait, each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in total? Then the molecule would have same number of each. But that's O2. Or maybe H2, but each H has 1 proton and no neutrons (if it's H-1). Wait, but H-2 has a neutron. So if the gas is H2, each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So each H atom has same number of protons and neutrons. So H2 would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons in total. That would fit the description. So gas W could be H2.

But wait, if X is a metal, when it reacts with a liquid, perhaps water? For example, sodium reacting with water produces hydrogen gas. So yes, that makes sense. So Y could be water
