Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. The reaction steps are as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are some hints provided:

Hint a: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
Hint b: The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options for E are:
A) 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one
B) 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one
C) 4-methylcycloheptan-1-one
D) 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one

So, I'll need to figure out the structure of each compound step by step.

First, let's think about the reaction steps.

Step 1: A + HCN → B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, then B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, B would be a cyanohydrin as well. But the product after HCN addition is compound B.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. H2 with Pd is usually a hydrogenation catalyst. So if B is a nitrile (since HCN adds as a cyanide group), then reducing a nitrile (like R-C≡N) would typically yield an amine (R-CH2-NH2) under certain conditions, but wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe B is a ketone with an added cyanide group, which upon hydrogenation would reduce the carbonyl. Wait no, the HCN addition would give a cyanohydrin, which has a -CN group attached to a carbon adjacent to an -OH group. Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again. HCN adds to a carbonyl group (like ketone) to form a cyanohydrin. The structure would be R-C(OH)-CN. Then, when that is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, the -CN group would be reduced. The nitrile group (CN) would reduce to a CH2NH2 group, but that's a primary amine. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible reduction of a cyanohydrin.

Another possibility: When you hydrogenate a nitrile (R-CN), it becomes R-CH2-NH2. But if the nitrile is part of a larger structure, perhaps attached to a carbonyl group, then hydrogenation would reduce both the nitrile and the carbonyl? Wait, but in the first step, the product is B, which would have a new -CN group. So A is a ketone, B is an alcohol with a -CN group attached. Then, when B is hydrogenated, the CN group is reduced. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should start from the hints to figure out the structure of A.

Hint a says that when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. That sounds like a Wittig reaction. The ylide would add to a carbonyl group, replacing the oxygen with the ylide's R group, forming an alkene.

The product of the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that structure. The cyclopentane has substituents at positions 1 and 2 (each a methyl group), and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is (CH(CH3)2) with a double bond, so it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, propan-2-ylidene is probably (CH2)2C=CH2? Hmm. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2CH2C=, but maybe I'm not getting that right. Alternatively, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 with a double bond. Oh wait, wait, the propan-2-ylidene group is (CH2)2C- with a double bond. No,
