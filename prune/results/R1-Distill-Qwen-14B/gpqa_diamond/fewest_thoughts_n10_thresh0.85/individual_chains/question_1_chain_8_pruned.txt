Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished. Hmm.

So, the problem states that there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. Wait, the lifetimes... I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates the energy of a particle to the precision of its measurement. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of Planck's constant over 2π, which is ħ. So ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2π, but sometimes people just approximate it as ΔEΔt ≥ ħ.

Wait, but wait. The lifetime of a state relates to the uncertainty in time because if a state exists for a certain amount of time, that's the time over which we're measuring its energy. So the uncertainty in time Δt would be roughly the lifetime, right?

So each state has a different lifetime. For E1, the lifetime τ1 is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds. So the uncertainty in energy for each state would be inversely proportional to their lifetimes. The formula would be ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, I think.

Wait, no, maybe it's more precise to say the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So ΔE = ħ/(2π τ). Because the uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/(2π). So if the lifetime is the Δt, then the minimum uncertainty in energy is about ħ/(2π τ).

Hmm, but I'm not too sure about the exact factors here. Maybe for this problem, we can approximate it as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, since the constants are just scaling factors and the question is about the order of magnitude.

So the idea is that for each state, the energy uncertainty is about ħ divided by the lifetime. If the energy difference between E1 and E2 is larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might overlap, making it hard to tell them apart. So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of their individual ΔE's.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe each state has its own energy uncertainty, and the separation between the two energy levels needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. So ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2), perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe each state's energy is a peak in some spectrum, and the widths of the peaks are determined by their lifetimes. Then, the two peaks can be resolved if the separation between them is greater than the sum of their half-widths (which are related to the uncertainties). I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact condition, but I think it's that the separation must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties.

So first, I'll compute ΔE1 and ΔE2. Let's compute them.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·
