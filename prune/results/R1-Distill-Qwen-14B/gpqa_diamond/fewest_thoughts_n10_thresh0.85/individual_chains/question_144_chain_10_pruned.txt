Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty on mesons, but let's think this through.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or -16 meters, which makes sense because particles decay pretty quickly.

Wait, how do I approach this? I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The width Γ is the total decay width, which is linked to the particle's lifetime (τ) via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ).

But wait, I think it's actually Γ = ħ/τ multiplied by something. Let me get the exact formula. Oh right, the decay width Γ is equal to ħ divided by the mean lifetime τ. So, Γ = ħ / τ → τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the lifetime by the particle's velocity. So, the mean distance L = v * τ.

So first, I need to calculate τ. Let's get the constants right. ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, but the width Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert units properly.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Convert Γ from MeV to GeV. Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.
2. Calculate τ = ħ / (Γ). So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) → let me compute that.
3. Then, find the velocity v of the meson. Since E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, I can use the relativistic energy formula E = γ m c².
