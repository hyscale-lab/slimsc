Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a star with some specific parameters. So, the star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main point is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The ratio (level 1 to level 2) decreases when the star has spots. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so Ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots.

Hmm, okay. So, the setup involves the Boltzmann equation, right? Because in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the population of energy levels depends on temperature.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations (n2/n1) is equal to (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Here, g is the statistical weight, and E is the energy of the level.

But wait, the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels. So, in the photosphere, when the star has spots, the effective temperature changes. Because spots are cooler regions, but wait, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So when 40% is covered by spots, the star's overall Teff is 5500 K instead of 6000 K.

Wait, but stars have varying temperatures across their surfaces. However, when they talk about the overall photospheric effective temperature, I think they're considering the average. So when spots are present, the average Teff is 5500 K.

But in the photosphere, each region contributes to the observed spectrum. The spots are cooler, so their contribution would have lower temperatures. But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So, I think the problem is assuming that the majority of the photosphere is at the unspotted temperature, but when spots are present, part of the photosphere is cooler.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the entire photosphere is now at 5500 K on average. Or maybe the spots are at a lower temperature, and the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. Hmm, that's a bit unclear. Wait, the problem says when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff drops. So, perhaps the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at a lower temperature, say T_spot. So the average Teff is 5500 K.

But wait, effective temperature is a blackbody measure. The Teff is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. So when part of the star is
