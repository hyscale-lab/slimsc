Okay, so I've got this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with excitation in stars, we often use the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states to temperature.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so we can apply the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n2/n1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this problem, I think E2 - E1 is the energy difference ΔE given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So, for star 1, the excitation is twice that of star 2. So, n1_2 / n1_1 = 2, assuming n1_1 is the lower state and n1_2 is the excited state. Wait, no, actually, the way the problem is stated may be that the number of excited atoms in star 1 is twice that of star 2. So, (n2/n1)_1 = 2, and (n2/n1)_2 is 1 for star 2, perhaps?

Wait, maybe it's better to set up equations for each star. Let's call star_1 as star 1 and star_2 as star 2.

For star 1: n1_2 / n1_1 = 2.
For star 2: n2_2 / n2_1 = let's say x. But wait, the problem says that in star_1, they are twice as excited. So maybe for the same energy level, the ratio is higher in star_1. So, for the same energy difference, star_1 has a higher excitation, meaning higher temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the excitation
