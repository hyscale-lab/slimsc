Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy through proton-proton fusion. There are different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrons, which then go on to form helium-4 nuclei. But wait, actually, the main pp branch is the pp-I, and the pp-II and pp-III are less significant, maybe side reactions.

Wait, no, the pp chain primarily involves the pp-I branch where two protons (protons are just hydrogen nuclei) fuse, one emits a positron and a neutrino, becoming a neutron, which then combines with another proton to form deuterium, and so on until helium-4 is formed. Oh right, and the neutrinos produced are electron neutrinos (ν_e) because a positron is emitted, which comes from the beta-plus decay of a neutron.

So, the pp-III branch—I'm a bit fuzzy here. Maybe the pp-III branch is a minor part of the pp chain that produces more high-energy neutrinos? Or perhaps it's a different process that contributes to the neutrino flux in specific energy ranges.

The question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The flux ratio is Flux(band1)/Flux(band2). The options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

So, what happens when the pp-III branch stops? I think about how each branch contributes to neutrino production. The pp-III branch is probably the main source of higher-energy neutrinos. If it stops, the flux in higher energy bands would drop more than in lower ones.

Wait, neutrinos from the pp chain are primarily in the 200-1000 keV range, I think. The pp-III branch would produce more of the higher energy neutrinos. So, if pp-III suddenly stops, the higher energy bands would lose their main source.

So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, the flux in the higher energy band (800-900 keV, band 2) would drop more than the lower band (700-800, band 1). But wait, band 2 is higher than band 1. So if pp-III is the main source for higher energies, then without it, band 2 would have less flux compared to band 1. So the flux ratio (band1 / band2) would be higher than 1.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remained as they were. So, do other neutrino sources contribute? Like, if pp-III is stopped, but other branches like pp-I continue, maybe some neutrinos are still being produced. Or perhaps other processes, like the CNO cycle, produce neutrinos as well. Wait, the CNO cycle is a different proton fusion process, more dominant in higher-mass stars, but the Sun is mostly pp chain. But even so, the CNO cycle does produce neutrinos, but I think they are of lower energy compared to the pp chain.

Hmm. But the neutrinos from the CNO cycle have lower energies, like around 50-100 keV, I think. So the bands we're looking at are higher than that. So if pp-III is stopped, the main source for the higher energies (like 800-900 keV) is gone, so band 2 would have almost no neutrinos, while band 1 might still have some from other sources.

Wait, but if the neutrinos are from the pp-III branch, which is a part of the main pp chain, then if that's stopped, the other parts may still contribute. Let me think: the main pp chain produces two neutrinos, right? Or wait, each fusion event produces two neutrinos, maybe. Or is the neutrino emission part of the overall chain?

Wait, the initial step in the pp chain is two protons fusing. They form a diproton, which is unstable and emits a positron and a neutrino, becoming a neutron. So each such event produces a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino depends on the process. So if the pp-III branch is a specific part of the chain that produces higher-energy neutrinos, then stopping it would affect the higher energy bands.

So, the pp-III branch is probably responsible for producing the highest-energy neutrinos in the Sun. So if it stops, the flux in the 800-900 keV band (band 2) would drop significantly. The 700-800 keV band (band 1) would still have some flux from other sources, maybe from the pp-I branch or other processes.

So the ratio would be band 1 flux divided by band 2 flux. If band 2's flux drops a lot because pp-III stopped, then the ratio would be higher than 1. Like, if band 2's flux drops by a factor of 10, then the ratio would be 10.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch was the main contributor to both bands, but more so to band 2, then without it, band 1 might have maybe 10% of its original flux, and band 2 almost nothing. So the ratio would be (0.1 * original band1) / (0.01 * original band2) if band2 was much lower. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact distribution.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is the main source for the 800-900 keV neutrinos, and the 700-800 keV band is also from pp-III but perhaps with a lower energy cutoff. So if pp-III stops, both bands' fluxes would drop, but band 2 would drop more. So the flux in band 1 would be from other sources, maybe.

Wait, but the question says the pp-III branch stopped. So if pp-III is the main source, then both bands would lose their main source. But perhaps the lower band (700-800) has other sources contributing, like the CNO cycle or other branches.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Sun's neutrinos are primarily from the pp chain. The main pp chain produces a neutrino each time a proton converts into a neutron (the beta-plus decay step). The energy of these neutrinos is about 200-1000 keV, I think. So the bands in the question are within this range.

The pp-III branch is a specific part of the pp chain. If it stops, then the neutrinos produced in that branch are no longer emitted. So the neutrinos from that branch would be a significant part of the higher energy bands.

In the pp chain, the initial steps produce lower-energy neutrinos, and the later steps (like pp-III) produce higher-energy ones. So the higher energy band (800-900 keV) would be mostly from pp-III. The lower band (700-800) would have some from pp-I and pp-II as well, perhaps.

So if pp-III stops, the higher band (band 2) would lose most of its flux, while the lower band
