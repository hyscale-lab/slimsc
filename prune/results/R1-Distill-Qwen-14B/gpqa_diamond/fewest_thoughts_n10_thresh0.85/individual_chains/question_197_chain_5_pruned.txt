Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about identifying a product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D. They've provided IR and NMR data for Compound X.

First, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Hittig reaction, which is a method to prepare alkenes by coupling two alky halides. Wait, no, wait—actually, another reaction involving red phosphorus and HI is the dehydrohalogenation or maybe the formation of ylides. Oh right, the Hittig reaction involves an organophosphorus ylide reacting with an alkyl halide to form alkenes. But wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, when an alkyne is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's called the oxymercuration or something else? No, that's with Hg(OAc)2. Oh wait, when an alkyne reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes hydrohalogenation. Or maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, when an alkyne reacts with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it's a dehydrohalogenation? Or perhaps it's a two-step addition. Let me think. Red phosphorus is a Lewis acid and can help in facilitating the reaction. The HI (hydroiodic acid) could be adding across the triple bond.

Wait, another thought: when an alkyne is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it typically adds twice, so the alkyne becomes a diiodide. But then, if there are more steps, like elimination, maybe it forms a diene? Or perhaps the reaction is more about forming a vinyl iodide. Hmm, not sure yet. Let me look at the data first.

The IR data for Compound X: peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid) or an N-H stretch, but the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 around there could be C=C stretching. Also, a peak at 1720 cm-1 which is likely a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester, or aldehyde. But wait, a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H around 2500-3400, and a carbonyl around 1700. So maybe that's a possibility.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong signal. This is probably an aldehyde proton (but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes upfield or downfield depending on substitution). Wait, but another possibility is an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H signals, but in the NMR, they usually appear around 10-12 ppm as a broad singlet. So 10.5 could be that.

But then, looking at other peaks:

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is typical of aromatic protons. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe para-substituted benzene. Like two protons on one set of carbons, each adjacent to substituents.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, likely the other two protons on another set of carbons in the aromatic ring.

So the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents—like two groups in the para positions, but wait, no, wait: in para substitution, each substituent is on opposite positions. Wait, the doublets in the NMR could be for a para-disubstituted benzene where each substituent is on adjacent carbons. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think: if it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent would be in the para position relative to each other. So the protons would be in two sets of doublets if the substituents are in the para positions. For example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 3, but wait, that's meta. No, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (para), then the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent and show as a doublet, and positions 3 and 5 as another doublet. So that would fit with the NMR data.

So the aromatic ring is para-substituted with two substituents, each in positions 1 and 3? No, wait, no—if substituents are in positions 1 and 4, then the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to substituents, and positions 3 and 5 would be meta. But I'm getting a bit confused here, perhaps it's better to think that the substituents are in positions 4 and another position, maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent with a certain structure.

Wait, another thing: the 1.7 ppm and 2.9 ppm signals. 2.9 is a multiplet (m) for 1H, maybe a CH adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a CH2 group near something else. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be part of a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or perhaps a carbonyl group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of 3H as a doublet, suggesting a methyl group attached to a CH. And the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal methyl group, probably part of an ethyl chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents that include a carbonyl group. Let me piece this together.

Looking back at the IR: 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the compound has a ketone or ester or perhaps an acid.

The NMR data includes a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be a carboxylic acid O-H, but that would usually be a broad peak, which it is (bs, 1H). Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but a bit upfield. However, if it's an aldehyde, then maybe the compound is an aromatic aldehyde. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR would have a broad O-H, but in the given IR, the 3400-2500 is a region for O-H, perhaps from a carboxylic acid, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the 3400–2500 could be from an alkyne (sp-hybridized C-H stretch), but that's usually around 3300. Wait, the IR data includes 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those could be C=C stretching, perhaps in an aromatic ring. 1610 is around where aromatic C=C stretches are, so that supports the presence of a benzene ring.

So, putting this together: a para-substituted benzene (due to the NMR aromatic signals) with substituents that include a carbonyl group (IR at 1720) and perhaps an aldehyde or carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm could correspond to a carboxylic acid proton, but wait, a carboxylic acid proton would be broad and around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the proton would be around 9-10 ppm. But given that the peak is at 10.5, maybe it's more likely a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but looking at the IR again: the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm-1, but it can be higher. So that fits. Also, the O-H stretching in the IR from 3400–2500 would correspond with a carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, the structure of Compound X might be a para-substituted benzoic acid with some substituent groups. Let me think about the NMR again.

The NMR shows a 1H at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet), which would be the -COOH proton. Wait, but wait, in benzoic acid, the O-H is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, yes.

But then, the other signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). If it's para-substituted, the two substituents would be on opposite positions. Wait, the benzoic acid would have a COOH group in position 1, and another substituent in position 4?

Wait, perhaps it's 4-(something)benzoic acid. Then, the substituent would be in the para position relative to the COOH group. So the substituent would be in position 4.

Looking at the substituent: the NMR has signals for CH groups. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is likely a CH adjacent to some electronegative group, like a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, perhaps part of an ester or ketone. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is itself attached to something else. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, maybe part of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a (sec-butyl) group attached at the para position of the benzoic acid. Let me think:

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene ring. Wait, no, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group, which is (CH2)2CHCH2-? No, wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-, no, wait, no. Wait, butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2-, iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-, and sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no, wait, the sec-butyl group is (CH2)CH2CH(CH3), no, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the substituent in this case is likely a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. Let's see: the NMR has a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) which could be the CH next to
