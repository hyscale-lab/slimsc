Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The matrix Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, I remember that the intrinsic angular momentum operator for spin-½ particles (like muons) is related to the Pauli matrices. Oh, right! The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. And S is probably one of them because the structure of S looks familiar.

Looking at S:
First row: 0, -i
Second row: i, 0
Wait, that's the form of the Pauli Y matrix. Let me recall: the Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So yes, S must be σy. Therefore, S is the Pauli Y matrix.

Given that, the operator Ay is c * σy. Since c = h/(4π), Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue. Alternatively, since σy is a Pauli matrix, I know its eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. Wait, but wait—wait, actually, for spin-½ particles, the eigenvalues of S (which is σ times ħ/2) are ± ħ/2. So let me check.

Wait, the operator A is the angular momentum. For a particle with spin s, the spin angular momentum is ħ times the Pauli matrices multiplied by (1/2), because s=1/2. So S = (ħ/2) σ. Wait, wait. Wait, the operator S is actually (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Or is it? Let me think. Oh right, the spin angular momentum operators are given by S = (ħ/2) σ. So each component, like Sx, Sy, Sz, is (ħ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix.

In this problem, Ay is given as c * S, but wait, no. Wait, the problem says Ay = c * S, where c = h/(4π). Hmm.

Wait, let's clarify: if c is h/(4π), and S is the Pauli Y matrix (σy), then Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

But wait, wait, wait. Let me think about the units. Plan
