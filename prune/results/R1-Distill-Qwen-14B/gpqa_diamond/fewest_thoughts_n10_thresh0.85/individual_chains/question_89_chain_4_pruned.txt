Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the final product's NMR spectrum. Let me break it down.

First, let's start by understanding each step of the reaction.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, specifically dehydrohalogenation, which forms an alkene. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, the molecule is quite rigid. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two equivalents of HBr to form an alkene. The product here is likely 1,3-adamantadiene, but wait, no, because the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2 (if the starting material is 1,3-dibromo). Wait, no, the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons? Because adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected to three others, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two non-adjacent carbons? Hmm, maybe I should reconsider. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on opposite ends of the adamantane structure. When KOH is used, it's a strong base that promotes elimination. Each Br would eliminate, but since they are at 1 and 3 positions, perhaps the product is a diene. Wait, no, because elimination of two HBr's would lead to a conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination between adjacent Brs, but wait, 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane? No, I think elimination forms an alkene. Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two non-adjacent carbons. So when KOH is added, each Br would eliminate, but with such a structure, perhaps the result is a
