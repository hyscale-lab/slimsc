Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's see... The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull as it orbits.

The setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So the main difference between the two planets is the shift in their spectral lines: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So, I need to find the ratio P2/P1.

I remember that the RV method's velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass and the star's mass. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )) * (1/(2π)) ) ), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the simplified version since M_p is much less than M_star. So M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

Alternatively, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period multiplied by the square root of the star's mass. Wait, but the stars are same mass so that might cancel out.

Wait, the formula for K is K = ( (2πG) / (c * P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ). But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, this simplifies to K ≈ ( (2πG) / (c * P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p) / (M_* )^(2/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²) ) ).

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) ) * (1/P^(1/3)).

Wait, looking for the relation between K and P. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), when K increases, P decreases, all else equal.

Wait, since both stars are the same mass, and the planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), so M_p and M_* are the same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so P ∝ 1/K^(3).

So if planet #1 has K1 = 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 has K2=7 milliangstroms.

So P1 is proportional to (1/K1)^3, and P2 proportional to (1/K2)^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 would be ( (1/K2) / (1/K1) )^3 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because (1/K2)^3 / (1/K1)^3 = (K1^3)/(K2^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me see:

P2 = ( (2pi G / (c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^{-1} ) * (1/(K)) )^3 ?

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let's think of the proportionality: since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So if K1 and K2 are the velocities for the two planets, then P1 ∝ 1/K1^3, P2 ∝ 1/K2^3.

So P2/P1 = [ (1/K2^3) ] / [ (1/K1^3) ] = (K1/K2)^3.

So K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, 5 cubed is 125, 7 cubed is 343. 125/343 is roughly 0.364. So P2/P1 is approximately 0.364, meaning P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So planet #2's orbital period is shorter than that of planet #1.

But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is P2's period than P1's. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that's shorter, so it's not longer. So the ratio is less than 1.

Wait, but the options are: Option A is ~0.36. So the correct answer would be A.

Alternatively, let's recheck. Wait, maybe I got the ratio backward. Because K is larger for the planet with the shorter period. Because higher K means the star is moving faster, which suggests a shorter period because you can make the star move quickly by having a tight orbit.

Wait, think about it: For a planet with a shorter orbital period, it must be orbiting closer to the star. A closer planet would cause a higher RV shift because the star's velocity is higher (since velocity is 2πa / P, where a is semi-major axis). So if K is higher, the period is shorter.

So, K2=7 is higher than K1=5. So P2 < P1.

Thus, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364 ⇒ about 0.36.

So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. Since P2 is shorter, the ratio is less than one, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be option A, approximately 0.36.


The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given that both planets orbit stars of the same mass (similar to the Sun) and have masses similar to Neptune. The key difference between the two planets is the periodic shift in their spectral lines: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, while planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Using the radial velocity (RV) method, the semi-amplitude of the spectral line shift \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). Since the stars and planets are similar in mass, the relationship simplifies to \( P \propto 1/K^3 \). Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer \( P_2 \) is compared to \( P_1 \), the ratio is less than 1, and the correct answer is approximately 0.36.
