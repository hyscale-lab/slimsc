Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the FTIR data: there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But since there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But wait, 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring. Oh wait, 1650 might be an aromatic C=C stretch if there's a conjugated system. Or maybe it's a carbonyl in a different environment, like an ester or ketone. 

Wait, but the presence of two carbonyl peaks is confusing. Maybe one is a ketone and the other is an ester? Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ketone or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 is a C=C from an alkene or an aromatic ring. But then why two peaks? Maybe the compound has two different carbonyl groups. Or maybe one is a stretch and the other is a vibration from a different part of the molecule. I'm not sure yet.

Next, the ¹H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are typically in alkenes, so that suggests there's an alkene group in the compound. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and an alkene group. Like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, perhaps? That could explain the peaks at 1700 and 1650. Maybe a ketone and an adjacent double bond. Or maybe it's an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Then, the mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is a common mass for something like (CH3)2O (since 2 carbons: 2*(12) =24, 6 hydrogens:6*(1)=6, O is 16, total 24+6+16=46? Wait, that's 46, not 45. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a CH3CHO group? Because CH3CHO has a molecular weight of 44 (12+1+12+16+1=42, wait no, CH3CHO is 2 carbons, so 2*12=24, 4 hydrogens (CH3 and CHO?), maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think about possible fragments: CH3CO would be 43, but maybe a fragment that includes something else. Alternatively, maybe a (CH2)2O group? (24 + 4 +16=44, no). Or maybe a (COCH3) group? Wait, COCH3 is 59 (12+16+12+3=53? No, wait: C=12, O=16, CH3 is 15, so 12+16+15=43. Hmm, not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH2=CH-O group? No, that's a higher mass. Wait, let's think about the possible formulas.

The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So if the molecular formula is one of these, let's see what the molecular weight would be:

C6H12O: (6*12)+(12*1)+(16)= 72+12+16=100 g/mol.

C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.

C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

C6H12O2: 72+12+32=116.

So the molecular ion would be at 100, 98, 114, or 116.

But the mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45. Hmm. Let me think about the possible fragments for each option. For example, if the molecule is an ester, like methyl something. Wait, but let's think about possible fragmentations.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which is an ester possibly, perhaps with a structure like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 or something. Or maybe a cyclic ester. Alternatively, maybe a diester?

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So the molecule has a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Another approach: The IR has a broad peak at 3000, which could be O-H. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if the O-H is present, that would suggest either -OH in the structure, like an alcohol, or perhaps a carboxylic acid. But if it's an acid, the IR would show a very broad peak, maybe, but perhaps a higher wavenumber? Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, broad, but sometimes stronger. Also, the presence of a carbonyl (1700) would be consistent with a carboxylic acid, but wait, carboxylic acids have their carbonyl around 1700-1720 cm⁻¹, but sometimes lower if conjugated. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1730-1750, but maybe lower if conjugated.

But wait, our IR has two peaks: 1700 and 1650. Maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 is an aromatic ring (C=C stretch) or an alkene. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there
