Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that metrics describe the geometry of spacetime, and in this case, it's a 2-dimensional metric since there are two spatial coordinates, x and y.

Wait, but pseudosphere... Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The term 'pseudosphere' comes up in hyperbolic geometry. So I think the metric here might be representing a space with hyperbolic geometry.

I recall that the metric for hyperbolic space can be written in different forms, like the Poincaré disk model. The Poincaré disk has a metric where the line element is ds² = [4/(1 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Comparing that to the given metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²) instead of (1 - x² - y²). Also, the numerator is 32 instead of 4. So let's see, if I factor out the 4 from the denominator, 4 - x² - y² = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So the denominator can be written as 4 times (1 - (x² + y²)/(4)). 

So the metric becomes [32 / (4*(1 - (x² + y²)/4)))] (dx² + dy²). Simplifying the constants: 32/4 is 8. So the metric is [8 / (1 - (x² + y²)/4)] (dx² + dy²). 

Wait a second, the standard Poincaré disk metric is [4/(1 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. So in our case, if we make a substitution like r' = sqrt(x² + y²)/2. Because then (x² + y²)/4 = (r')². So the denominator becomes (1 - (r')²). 

So the metric would then be 8/(1 - (r')²) (dx² + dy²). But dx² + dy² is r'² dr'² + r'² dθ², right? So substituting, we have 8/(1 - r'²) * (r'² dr'² + r'² dθ²) = [8 r'²/(1 - r'²)] (dr'² + dθ²). 

Wait, but the standard form is [4/(1 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So comparing, let me see: if I have 8 r'²/(1 - r'²) (dr'² + dθ²), that can be written as 2*(4 r'²/(1 - r'²)) (dr'² + dθ²). So this is 2 times the standard Poincaré metric, but scaled in r' by a factor. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things here.

Alternatively, maybe the radius of the pseudosphere is related to the curvature. The radius r of a pseudosphere is related to the curvature. For hyperbolic spaces, the Gaussian curvature K is negative, and K = -1/(r²), where r is the radius of curvature. Wait no, I think the radius of the pseudosphere is related to the curvature. Let me think: for a surface of constant negative curvature, the Gaussian curvature K is -1/a², where a is the radius of curvature. So if the pseudosphere has radius r=2, then K = -1/(2)² = -1/4. 

Wait, looking back at the metric. The Poincaré disk model has a metric where the curvature is -1/( (a)^2 ), where a is the radius of the disk. So if the curvature is K, then the metric is [4/(1 - (x² + y²)/a²)] (dx² + dy²). So in our given metric, 32/(4 - x² - y²) is the same as 32/[4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)] = 8/[1 - (x² + y²)/4]. So comparing to the standard form (4)/(1 - (x² + y²)/a²), we have 8 =4 * 2, and the denominator is 1 - (x² + y²)/4. So this suggests a²=4, meaning a=2. So the radius of the pseudosphere (the curvature radius) is 2. Because the curvature K is -1/(a)^2 = -1/4. So the pseudosphere has radius r=2, which matches the question.

So the question is asking for the area of this pseudosphere. Wait, but wait, a pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface. Or wait, perhaps I'm confusing terms. Wait, no, a pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature, so it's like a saddle shape. But when we talk about the area of a pseudosphere, I think we're referring to its total surface area. Or wait, maybe in this context, the area of the "pseudosphere" as in a two-dimensional surface embedded in three-dimensional space, but perhaps in this case, the metric is for a two-dimensional hyperbolic space, which is the pseudosphere. Or maybe the question is referring to the area of the universe if this metric describes a universe (since it's 2+1 dimensional? Or wait, no, the metric given is only for spatial part, perhaps in 2 spatial dimensions. Wait, the metric's ds² is a function of dx and dy, so it's a 2-dimensional space. So the question is about the area of this 2-dimensional space, which is a pseudosphere of radius 2.

Wait, but the area of a pseudosphere (which is a surface in 3D) is infinite, because it's like a saddle, infinitely extending. But if it's a 2-dimensional space, the total area would be infinite. Wait, but let me think about the area of a hyperbolic plane. The hyperbolic plane has infinite area, yes. So the total area would be infinite. Alternatively, if it's a compact space, maybe not, but in this case, the metric seems to cover the entire hyperbolic plane.

Wait, but the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 -x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). The denominator is 4 - x² - y², so this is non-zero when x² + y² <4. So the domain of x and y is such that x² + y² <4. So it's the interior of a circle with radius 2. Wait, that's interesting. So the metric is defined for points where x² + y² <4. So it's like a disk of radius 2, but with a hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, but then the area of the pseudosphere, in this case, would be the integral over this disk. Wait, no, the area is computed using the metric. So the area would be the integral over x and y of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Wait, but for a 2-dimensional metric in the form ds² = g_xx dx² + 2 g_xy dx dy + g_yy dy², the area element is sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy²) dx dy.

In our case, the metric is diagonal. So g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 -x² - y²), and g_xy=0. So the determinant is (32/(4 -x² - y²))². The square root of that is 32/(4 -x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 -x² - y²)] dx dy. So the total area is the integral of this over the region where x² + y² <4.

Wait, so the area is:

Area = ∫∫ [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy over x² + y² <4.

Convert to polar coordinates: x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ. The limits are r from 0 to 2, θ from 0 to 2π.

So,

Area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Factor out constants:

32 ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Compute the integrals step by step.

First, the θ integral: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

Then the r integral: ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr. So -(1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (u=4 to u=0) [1/u] * (-1/2) du.

Which is (1/2) ∫ (u=0 to u=4) [1/u] du.

Wait, but wait, the integral of 1/u is ln |u|. So,

(1/2) [ ln u ] from 0 to 4.

But ln(0) is negative infinity. So this integral diverges. Which means the area is infinite.

So the total area is 32 * 2π * (diverges to infinity) → the area is infinite.

So the answer would be option D) +infty.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because the integral of r/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2. Let me compute it without substitution.

∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ) ].

Let me let u = 4 - r², du= -2r dr → -(1/2) du = r dr. So,

∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ) ] = ∫ [ (1/u) * (-1/2) du ) ] = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

Which is (-1/2) ln |u| + C. Evaluated from r=0 to 2. 

At r=2: u=0. ln(0) is -infty. At r=0: u=4. So,

[ (-1/2) ln(0) ) ] - [ (-1/2) ln(4) ) ].

But ln(0) is -infty, so (-1/2)(-infty) is +infty. The second term is finite.

So the integral from 0 to 2 is +infty. So the area is 32 * 2π * infty = infty. So the area is infinite.

Therefore, the correct answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space. This metric resembles the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, where the line element is typically written as 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{4}{1 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right),
\]

with \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). By comparing the two metrics, it can be seen that the given metric corresponds to a hyperbolic space with a curvature radius \( a = 2 \), as the denominator in the given metric is \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 = 4(1 - (x^2 + y^2)/4) \), matching the standard form with \( a^2 = 4 \).

The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). In hyperbolic geometry, the pseudosphere is an infinite surface, and its total area is infinite. To confirm this, the area can be computed using the metric. The area element in 2 dimensions is given by 

\[
dA = \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( g \) is the metric tensor. For the given metric, \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \) and \( g_{xy} = 0 \), so 

\[
\sqrt{\text{det}(g)} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}.
\]

Thus, the total area is 

\[
\text{Area} = \int \int \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy,
\]

over the region \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). Converting to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta, y = r \sin\theta \)), the integral becomes 

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \), and the radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \) diverges because \( \ln(4 - r^2) \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( r \to 2 \). Therefore, the total area is infinite.

In conclusion, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
