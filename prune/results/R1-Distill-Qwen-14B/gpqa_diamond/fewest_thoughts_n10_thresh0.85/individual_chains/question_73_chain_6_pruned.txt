Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that at high speeds, relativistic effects come into play, so I can't just use classical mechanics. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting the two velocities. I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait, actually, since both are moving in the same direction, I need to make sure I plug them correctly. Let me get the formula right.

So, if astronaut A is moving at v1 and astronaut B at v2, then the relative speed of A as seen from B's frame is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Oh wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, since B is moving at v2, then from B's perspective, A's speed is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Let me make sure I get the signs correct. Both are positive in the same direction, so v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately. Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 = 0.142857...c, approximately 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.

Now, the total
