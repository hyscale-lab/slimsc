Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A through D.

Hmm, okay, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be known. One of the key applications is the energy-time uncertainty relation. The formula I recall is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but I think in many contexts, people use ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, ignoring the 1/2 factor because the exact value isn't critical for order-of-magnitude estimates. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime (which is the time uncertainty, Δt). The longer the lifetime, the smaller the energy uncertainty, meaning you can measure the energy more precisely.

So in this problem, each state has a certain lifetime, which is the time for which it exists before decaying. The energy difference between the two states must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state for them to be distinguishable. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small, and the measurements could overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

Let me jot that down. The lifetimes are τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s. The energy-time uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But wait, the options are in electron volts (eV), so I need to convert units appropriately.

First, let me calculate the energy uncertainties for each state.

For state 1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1
For state 2: ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. Let me think. The energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, perhaps? Because if each energy has an uncertainty, the difference needs to be larger than both to be resolved. Or maybe the maximum uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. So:

ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2

Because otherwise, the difference might be within the combined uncertainty, making it impossible to distinguish.

Wait, but wait, no. Each state has its own energy, E1 and E2, and the measurement precision for each is ΔE1 and ΔE2. The uncertainty in E2 - E1 would be the sum of their uncertainties, I think. So to clearly distinguish, the energy difference should be larger than the combined uncertainty.

So let's compute each ΔE and then see what the combined uncertainty is.

Let me calculate ΔE1 and ΔE2.

First, compute ΔE1 = ħ / τ1
ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s
τ1 = 1e-9 s

ΔE1 = 1.054571
