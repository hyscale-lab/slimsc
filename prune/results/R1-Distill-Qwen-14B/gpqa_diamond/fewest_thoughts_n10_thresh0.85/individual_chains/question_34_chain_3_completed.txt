Okay, so I have this question about the Pinacol rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that Pinacol rearrangement involves vicinal diols reacting with acid, leading to the formation of a carbocation and then rearrangement. Let me think about the steps.

The general process is that when vicinal diols (two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons) react under acidic conditions, they lose water to form a carbocation. Then, a hydride or an alkyl group shifts to stabilize the carbocation, resulting in the formation of a ketone.

Let me break down each compound given and see what their products would be.

Starting with compound A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. So the structure should be HO-C(CH3)(Ph)-CH2-CH2-OH? Wait, no, wait. Hexane-3,4-diol means diols are on C3 and C4. So it's HO-CH2-C(CH3)(Ph)-CH2-CH2-OH? No, wait, hexane is six carbons. So maybe the structure is more like:

HO-C(CH2CH3)(Ph)-CH2-OH? Wait, maybe I need to draw it.

Wait, 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. So the molecule is hexane with diols on 3 and 4. So positions 3 and 4 are each bearing an OH group. Also, position 3 has a methyl group and position 4 has a phenyl.

So the structure is:

HO-CH2-C(Ph)(CH2CH2...? Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

CH2(OH)-C(CH3)(Ph)-CH2-OH ?

Wait, no. Wait, hexane is six carbons. So numbering from left to right: 1, 2,3,4,5,6. The diols are on 3 and 4. So:

1: CH2-

2: CH2-

3: C(OH)(something) - so 3rd carbon has OH, and a methyl group?

Wait, 3-methyl means the 3rd carbon has a methyl substituent. So the structure is:

Let me write the structure step by step.

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C(OH)(CH3) 

Carbon 4: C(OH)(Ph)

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, no, because hexane has six carbons. So carbons 1-6: 1 and 6 are CH3, 2 and 5 are CH2, 3 and 4 are the diol carbons.

Wait, no. Let me try again.

Structure for 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol:

Positions 1 2 3 4 5 6

Each position: 1 is CH3, 2 is CH2, 3 is C(OH)(CH3), 4 is C(OH)(Ph), 5 is CH2, 6 is CH3.

Wait, but that would make the structure:

CH3-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-C(OH)(Ph)-CH2-CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would be a CH2 group attached to the 3rd carbon, which is already a diol carbon. Hmm, perhaps the structure is:

HO-C(CH3)(CH2CH2Ph) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction. When the diol (vicinal) reacts with acid, it loses a water molecule from each OH, forming a carbocation. Then, a group shifts to form a ketone.

So for compound A, the diol is on C3 and C4. Upon protonation, each OH loses a water, leading to the formation of a bridged oxonium ion, then breaking to form two carbocations or a carbocation and a loss of water.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that the diol loses two water molecules, leading to the formation of a carbocation at each adjacent carbon, which then undergo hydride or alkyl shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the mechanism is that the diol forms a cyclic intermediate, which then breaks down. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy. Let me try to remember. The Pinacol rearrangement occurs when the diol loses two water molecules, leading to the formation of a carbocation adjacent to the other, which can then undergo a hydride or alkyl shift to form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the diol becomes a carbocation at each end, and one of the groups shifts. So, for compound A, the two adjacent carbons (3 and 4) each have OH groups. Acid protonates the OH, leading to loss of water and formation of a carbocation.

Wait, but in the case of vicinal diols, when both OH groups are protonated, the adjacent carbons each have a positive charge, and the loss of water leads to the formation of a bridge, which then collapses into a carbocation.

I think the correct approach is that the two adjacent OH groups lose water, leading to the formation of a dioxonium ion, which then undergoes cleavage, with a carbocation formed and a group shifting.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol loses a water molecule, leading to adjacent carbocations. But that's not possible because two adjacent positive charges are unlikely. So more accurately, the diol forms a cyclic intermediate, and then it breaks down.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the diol is protonated on one OH, which leaves as water, forming a carbocation on that carbon. Then the adjacent OH is also protonated, but since one carbon is now positively charged, the other OH can leave, leading to a neighboring carbocation. Then a group shifts from one carbon to another.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the diol as:

HO-R-OH where R is a carbon chain. Protonation leads to the formation of a good leaving group (water), so the two adjacent carbons each have a positive charge, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the diol loses two water molecules, leading to adjacent carbocations, but that's not stable. So perhaps a hydride or alkyl shift occurs to form a more stable carbocation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about a specific example.

In the Pinacol reaction, a vicinal diol (like pinacol itself: 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol) upon treatment with acid rearranges to pinacolone (3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone). The mechanism is that the diol loses two water molecules, forming a carbocation, which then rearranges.

Wait, pinacol is (CH3)2C(OH)-C(OH)(CH3). So on acid treatment, it loses two water molecules to form (CH3)2C+=C(CH3)+, which is a bridge. Then, a methyl group shifts to the adjacent carbon, forming a more stable carbocation. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism forms a cyclic intermediate. So the diol becomes a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar, which then breaks down.

But another way: when the diol is protonated, the -OH becomes -OH2+. Then, the leaving group (water) departs, forming a carbocation. The other OH is also protonated, and it too loses water, forming another carbocation adjacent to the first. But that's not stable, so a group (like a hydride or alkyl) shifts from one carbocation to the other, leading to a more stable structure.

Wait, perhaps the carbocation can form at each adjacent position, and one will rearrange. So, the diol's structure determines which carbocation is formed and which group shifts.

So for compound A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol.

The structure is: HO-C(CH3)(Ph)-CH2-CH2-OH? No, wait, hexane-3,4-diol would have OH on C3 and C4, and the chain is six carbons. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-C(OH)(Ph)-CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps it's better to write it as:

HO-C(CH3)(Ph)-CH2-CH2-OH? No, that would be a four-carbon chain with substituents. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Hexane is six carbons. So positions 1 to 6.

3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol:

- At position 3: a methyl group and an OH.

- At position 4: a phenyl group and an OH.

So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-C(OH)(Ph)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that can't be right because that would be a six-carbon chain, with position 3 and 4 having OH and substituents.

So when the Pinacol rearrangement occurs, the diol becomes:

Each OH is protonated. One OH leaves as H2O, forming a carbocation on C3. The adjacent OH (on C4) is also protonated, but since C3 is now positive, perhaps the other OH leaves as well, forming a carbocation on C4.

But having two adjacent carbocations isn't feasible, so a hydride or methyl shift occurs.

Wait, perhaps one carbocation forms, and the adjacent OH leaves as water, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the diol forms a cyclic transition state, leading to a carbocation at one position, which then rearranges.

Alternatively, perhaps when both hydroxyl groups lose water, the adjacent carbons each have positive charges, which then transfer a group. But that's not very clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol, upon protonation and loss of water, forms a carbocation at C3. Then, the other OH (on C4) is protonated and leaves as H2O, forming another carbocation at C4. Wait, but that's two adjacent carbocations, which may not be stable. So perhaps a hydride shift occurs from C4 to C3, stabilizing the carbocation. Or maybe a methyl group or phenyl group shifts.

Wait, in the case of compound A, the diol is on C3 and C4, with C3 having a methyl group and C4 having a phenyl group.

So when the diol reacts, the two adjacent carbons (3 and 4) become positive. But since that's not feasible, one of them must stabilize the positive charge by a shift.

Wait, perhaps a hydride or an alkyl group shifts from C3 to C4 or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the more substituted carbocation is more stable, so the group that allows for the most stable carbocation will shift.

Let me think: in compound A, after losing two water molecules, perhaps the positive charges are on C3 and C4. But that can't be right. So perhaps the diol forms a bridged ion, and then breaks to form a carbocation.

Wait, perhaps the diol forms a cyclic intermediate where both carbons are adjacent to the oxygen, and then the bridge breaks, leading to a carbocation that can rearrange.

Alternatively, perhaps the Pinacol rearrangement leads to the formation of a ketone by the migration of a group from one carbon to another, resulting in the loss of a water molecule and the formation of a carbonyl group.

So, the general outcome is that the two adjacent diol carbons become carbocations, and one group (like a hydride, methyl, or phenyl) shifts to form a more stable carbocation, which then deprotonates to form a ketone.

So, for compound A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol.

When it reacts, the OH groups are protonated and leave as water, leading to adjacent carbocations.

Now, the carbocation on C3 is CH2+ -C(CH3)(Ph)-CH2-CH2-... Wait, no: after losing the OH, C3 would have a positive charge and the substituents. Similarly, C4 would have a positive charge.

But two adjacent positive charges are not stable, so one of the groups must shift.

So, perhaps a group from C4 shifts to C3, or a group from C3 shifts to C4.

Wait, the substituents on C3 are CH3 and the rest, and on C4 it's Ph and the rest.

So, the most stable carbocation would be the one with more substituents. So, the phenyl group is a good substituent for stabilizing a carbocation.

So perhaps the phenyl group shifts from C4 to C3, thereby forming a more stable carbocation on C3.

Wait, but shifting a phenyl group would be a big move. Alternatively, the methyl group from C3 could shift to C4.

Wait, but the methyl is a small group. Let's think: if the C3 carbocation is [CH(CH3)(Ph)]+, but wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure after losing water is:

(CH2)2-C(+)(CH3) - C(+)(Ph) - (CH2)2.

That's not possible because adjacent carbocations are unstable. So instead, a group must shift.

So, perhaps a hydride (H-) shifts from C4 to C3, making the carbocation on C3 more stable.

Alternatively, the methyl group from C3 could shift to C4, forming a more stable carbocation on C4.

Wait, which would be more stable: a carbocation on C3 with the phenyl group or on C4 with the methyl?

A phenyl group is a better stabilizing group than a methyl group because of conjugation and resonance. So, perhaps the phenyl group would not shift because it's already on C4, which would be adjacent to the positive charge. Wait, no—if the carbocation is on C4, having a phenyl group attached would stabilize it more.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group on C3 shifts to C4, which would create a carbocation on C4 with a phenyl group, making it more stable.

Let me imagine the shifting. If the methyl group moves from C3 to C4, then C4's carbocation would have a methyl and a phenyl attached, making it more stable than C3's carbocation.

So, after the shift, C4 would have a positive charge, a phenyl, and two methyl groups? Wait, no, because the methyl is moving from C3 to C4. So, the structure after shift would be:

C3: (CH2)2, and C4 would have two substituents: phenyl and the shifted methyl, plus the positive charge.

Wait, but in reality, the carbocation would form at a position that allows maximum stabilization.

Wait, maybe I should think of the product. The product of a Pinacol rearrangement is a ketone. So for compound A, after the reaction, we'll have a ketone at either C3 or C4.

Wait, but in the Pinacol rearrangement, the ketone forms by the migration of a group and the loss of a water. So, the general outcome is that the diol converts into a ketone where one of the adjacent carbons loses a group (like a methyl or phenyl), and the adjacent carbon becomes a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about a specific example.

Take the first compound: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. After the reaction, the product A would be a ketone.

So, during the reaction:

The diol (hexane-3,4-diol) loses two water molecules, forming two carbocations on C3 and C4. But these are adjacent, so one group must shift.

Suppose the methyl group shifts from C3 to C4. Then, the C4 carbocation would have a methyl and phenyl group attached, which is more stable.

Once the group shifts, the positive charge is on C4. Then, a proton is picked up, and the adjacent oxygen becomes a hydroxyl group, which upon dehydration forms a ketone.

Wait, no. Alternatively, after the group shifts, the carbocation is at C4. Then, the adjacent carbons (C4 and C5) would form a double bond? No, perhaps the OH from C5 (if any) is involved. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbocation rearrangement leads to the formation of a ketone. So, which position becomes the carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps the ketone forms on the same carbon where the group shifted. So, when a methyl group shifts from C3 to C4, the C4 becomes a carbocation, which then forms a ketone by losing a proton and forming a double bond.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Pinacol rearrangement leads to the formation of a ketone. The mechanism is that the diol loses two water molecules, forming a carbocation, which then undergoes a shift (like a hydride or alkyl) to form a more stable carbocation. Then, the oxygen adjacent to the carbocation attacks, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the oxygen from the original diol, now deprotonated, attacks the carbocation, leading to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think about the product structures given in the options.

Looking at option A, the product for compound A is 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one. So that's a five-carbon ketone with substituents on C3.

Another option is option C, which for A is 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one. So the same as option A.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: A is 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

Option C: A is same as option A's A.

Wait, but for B, option C says 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each product.

So for compound A:

After the rearrangement, the ketone is formed by the migration of a group and the loss of water. Let's assume that in compound A, the group that migrates is a methyl group from C3 to C4.

When that happens, the C4 becomes a carbocation. Then, the oxygen on C5 (or perhaps C3?) attacks, leading to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product structure would have a carbonyl group at C2 or C3.

Wait, the original diol is on C3 and C4. After rearrangement, the ketone is likely to form on C3 or C4, depending on where the group migrated.

If a group (like methyl) moves from C3 to C4, then the carbocation is on C4. Then, the adjacent oxygen (from C5) would attack, leading to the formation of a ketone on C4. Wait, but that would require the oxygen to be in a position to attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the oxygen from C3 becomes the carbonyl group.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the product.

If the diol is on C3 and C4, and a group shifts from C3 to C4, then the carbocation would be on C4. The oxygen from C3 (which was originally an OH) would then attack the C4 carbocation, leading to the formation of a five-membered ring? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the oxygen (now as O-) attacks the adjacent carbocation, forming a bond and creating a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the attack occurs between the oxygen and the carbocation. So, if the carbocation is on C4 and the O is on C3, the O would attack C4, creating a bond between C3 and C4, but that would form a ring.

Wait, but in reality, the product is a ketone. So the carbonyl group would be at the position where the carbocation was.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the option structures.

For compound A, the product is either 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one (option A, C) or 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one (option B, D).

Wait, 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one would have the structure:

CH3-C(O)-C(Ph)(CH2CH2CH3) ?

Wait, let me draw pentan-2-one. It's a five-carbon chain with the ketone on C2.

So, structure: CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3.

But with substituents.

In the case of 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-C(Ph)(CH2CH2CH2?) No, wait, pentan-2-one is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, the third carbon (from the ketone) would have substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-C(Ph)(CH2CH3).

So, the ketone is at C2, and C3 has a phenyl and an ethyl group.

That would make sense if the group from C3 in the diol shifted to form the ketone.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the possible product.

If in compound A, the diol is at C3 and C4, and the group migration leads to the formation of a ketone at C3.

Wait, no, perhaps the ketone would form at the position where the carbocation was stabilized.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a five-membered compound, which would come from the loss of a carbon.

Wait, the starting material is hexane (six carbons), and the product is pentanone (five carbons). So, perhaps one carbon is lost as CO2? No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a five-carbon compound because of the way the groups rearrange.

Wait, in the Pinacol rearrangement, the two diol carbons become the carbonyl and the adjacent carbon. So, the product would have one fewer carbon than the starting material? No, because the diol is on adjacent carbons, and the product is a ketone on one of them, so the chain length remains similar.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Looking at option C for product A: 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one. The formula is C12H14O.

Wait, the starting material for A is 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. The formula is C11H16O2.

Wait, upon rearrangement, the product loses two hydroxyl groups as water, so the formula would be C11H14O.

But product A's formula is C12? Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the product's formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the product has the same number of carbons as the starting material.

Wait, hexane is 6 carbons. The product is pentanone, 5 carbons. Hmm, that suggests loss of a carbon, which doesn't make sense for the Pinacol rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a seven-carbon compound. No, if the starting material is six carbons, the product would be similar.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the other compounds.

Let me move on to compound B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol.

The structure is:

HO-C(Ph)(Ar)-C(OH)(Ph)-CH2-CH2-OH?

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

HO-C(Ph)(Ar)-C(OH)(Ph)-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

The structure is pentane-2,3-diol, with substituents.

So, the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-C(Ph)(Ar)-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, Ar is 4-hydroxyphenyl.

So, the two diol groups are on C2 and C3, with C2 having a phenyl group and a 4-hydroxyphenyl group, and C3 having a phenyl group and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product.

In the Pinacol rearrangement, the diol would lose two water molecules, leading to adjacent carbocations. Then a group shifts.

In this case, the substituents are phenyl and 4-hydroxyphenyl. The 4-hydroxyphenyl is a bulky group and a good stabilizer for carbocations.

So, perhaps the group that shifts is the phenyl from C2 to C3, or the 4-hydroxyphenyl from C2 or C3.

Wait, the 4-hydroxyphenyl is attached to C2, and the phenyl is attached to C3.

So, when the diol loses water, the adjacent carbocations form on C2 and C3.

To stabilize, one group shifts. The phenyl (which is better as a substituent than a hydrogen) might shift.

Alternatively, the 4-hydroxyphenyl group is a good substituent, so perhaps the phenyl group on C3 shifts to C2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the 4-hydroxyphenyl group (on C2) shifts to C3, making a more stable carbocation on C3.

In any case, the product would be a ketone. Let's look at the options.

Option C for B is 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

Hmm, that would imply that the ketone is on C2, and C3 has both 4-hydroxyphenyl and phenyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a ketone on C3.

Wait, perhaps the shift leads to the formation of a ketone on C3, with substituents on C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone on C2, with substituents on C2 and C3.

But given the options, perhaps the correct product is a ketone on C3 or C2.

Moving on to compound C: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol.

The structure is:

HO-C(Ph)(OPh)2 - C(OH)(OPh)2 - CH2-?

Wait, no, the formula is 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol.

So, it's ethane-1,2-diol, with substituents:

- On C1: two 4-methoxyphenyl groups and an OH.

- On C2: a phenyl group, a 4-methoxyphenyl group, and an OH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

HO-C(Ph)(OPh)2 - C(OH)(Ph)(OPh) ?

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

HO-C(Ph)(OPh)2 - C(OH)(Ph)(OPh).

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. In any case, this is a vicinal diol with multiple phenyl substituents.

Under acidic conditions, both OH groups would lose water, leading to adjacent carbocations. But with all those substituents, there's a lot of possibility for group shifts.

The product would likely be a ketone where one substituent has shifted to form a more stable carbocation.

Given the substituents, the most likely shift is a phenyl group or a 4-methoxyphenyl group.

But the product, according to the options, is either 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one or 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one, etc.

So, the ketone would form on either C1 or C2.

If the group shifts from C2 to C1, the ketone would form on C1. Alternatively, if the group shifts from C1 to C2, the ketone would form on C2.

Given that 4-methoxyphenyl groups are bulky and good at stabilizing carbocations through resonance, perhaps a group would shift from C2 to C1, making a more stable carbocation on C1.

Alternatively, perhaps the phenyl group on C2 shifts to C1, leaving a carbocation on C2, which then forms the ketone.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's try to tie this back to the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A for C: 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one.

So, the ketone is on C1, and C2 has three 4-methoxyphenyl groups.

Option C for C: 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one.

So, ketone on C1, and on C2, two 4-methoxyphenyl and one phenyl.

Hmm.

In the starting material for C, C1 has two 4-methoxyphenyl and a phenyl? Or perhaps it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps during the rearrangement, a 4-methoxyphenyl group shifts from C2 to C1, making C1 have three 4-methoxyphenyl groups and C2 losing one.

If that's the case, ketone would form on C1, as the substituents are more on C1.

So, option A for C would be the product: 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one.

But let's look at the options.

Now, considering all three products, let's see which options match.

Looking at the options:

Option C for each product:

A: 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one.
B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.
C: 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one.

Wait, what's the structure for product C in option C? It's 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one.

So, that's a ketone on C1 (ethan-1-one), with substituents on C1 and C2.

On C1: a phenyl group and two 4-methoxyphenyl groups? Or is it that C2 has two 4-methoxyphenyl and a phenyl, and ketone on C1.

Hmm.

So, putting it all together, which option correctly gives the products.

Now, looking for which option has:

A: 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

C: 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one.

Looking at the options:

Option C has these three products.

So, option C would be the correct one.


The Pinacol rearrangement involves vicinal diols reacting with acid, leading to the formation of a carbocation and subsequent rearrangement to form a ketone. The reaction proceeds through the loss of water from the diol, creating adjacent carbocations, and a group (such as a hydride or alkyl group) shifts to stabilize the carbocation. This results in the formation of a ketone.
