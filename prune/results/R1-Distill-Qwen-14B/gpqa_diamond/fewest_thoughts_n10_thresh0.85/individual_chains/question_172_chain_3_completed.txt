Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature via the Boltzmann equation. 

So the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 in a specific energy level. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is involved here, right? The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution: n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Since E2 is higher than E1, the exponent is negative.

In this case, n1 (higher excitation) is twice n2. Wait no, wait. Wait, the question says star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. Oh, so the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So the ratio (n1/n2) = 2. 

Wait wait, so for the same energy levels, but different stars. So in star_1, n1 is twice star_2's n2. So the ratio would be (n1)/(n2) = 2. But from the Boltzmann equation, (n2)/(n1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.

Let me think again. The energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 higher. So the ratio of atoms in E2 to E1 is (n2)/(n1) = exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) ). But in this question, I think they're considering a specific energy level. Wait, no. Oh, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So I think they're considering the same energy level for both stars, but the excitation (populations) differ between the two stars.

Wait, no. Let me read again. The question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So for the same energy level, the population is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. So for the same energy level, n1 = 2 n2.

Wait, but the energy levels themselves are the same for both stars because it's a specific energy level. So the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Oh wait, no. Wait, wait. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the energy level transition is the same. So ΔE is the same for both stars.

So, each star has the same energy difference between levels. So the ratio of the populations in star_1 and star_2 for that same energy level would be n1/n2 = 2. Because in star_1, that level is more populated.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So the population of that level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1_level = 2 * n2_level.

But wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of two energy levels (E1 and E2) in the same star. But here, the same energy level is being considered in two different stars. So perhaps we need to think about the ratio of the populations of that same level in each star, given their respective temperatures.

Wait, but the energy level is the same. So each star's photosphere has the same energy level, but the thermal conditions (T) make the population of that level differ. So the ratio between the populations of that level in the two stars is 2.

So for each star, the population of that level (n) would be given by the Boltzmann factor relative to the ground state. But since the stars are in LTE, for each star, the population of the level is determined by n = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights. But the problem states that the energy difference is the same for both stars, so the ΔE is the same.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio between the two stars' populations is given by (n1)/(n2) = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/(k T2) - 1/(k T1)) ) )? Or wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, since the same energy level is being considered, the ratio between the two stars' populations is n1 = 2 n2. But each star's n is determined by their own temperature. So for each star, the population of that level is given by n = (g * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )) / Q, where Q is the partition function. But assuming that the partition function Q is similar for both stars (since they are similar in other ways?), perhaps the ratio of n1 to n2 is exp(ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )) ).

Wait, let me think. For each star, the population of the excited level is n = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) * (1/Q). But if we assume that for both stars, the ratio between g2 and g1 is the same (same element, same level), then the ratio n1/n2 would be (exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ).

So n1/n2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ).

We know that n1/n2 = 2. So taking natural logs on both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Rearranging, we get:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = (k ln 2) / ΔE

But wait, k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, but wait, the ΔE given is 1.38e-23 J. That's the same as k! Because k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So indeed, k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So substituting, we get:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ( (1.38e-23 J/K) * ln 2 ) ) / (1.38e-23 J )

The 1.38e-23 terms cancel out, so:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln 2.

Multiply both sides by (T1 T2) to eliminate denominators:

T1 - T2 = ln 2 * T1 T2

Wait, but let's see:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2

Which is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln 2.

So,

(T1 - T2) = ln 2 * T1 T2

But we're interested in an equation involving T1 and T2.

The options given are:

Option A: ln(2) = T2 / T1 → No, that doesn't look right.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) → Hmm, not matching what I have.

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 − T2)/(T1 T2)^2 → Not matching.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 − T2)/(T1 T2) → Yes! Because from earlier, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln 2.

So looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but wait. Let me check the signs. Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln 2 → (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )= ln 2.

So yeah, option D is that equation. So the correct equation is option D.


The question involves determining the correct equation for the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The stars are assumed to be in Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann equation applies.

The Boltzmann distribution relates the populations of two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the populations of the energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. In this case, the population of the specific energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = 2.
\]

Substituting this into the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of the populations becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{\ln(2) \cdot k}{\Delta E}.
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which is equal to \(k\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting this equation in terms of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options do not align with the derived equation:

- **Option A**: \(\ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1}\) is incorrect because it does not account for the energy difference or the temperature relationship derived from the Boltzmann equation.
- **Option B**: \(\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2}\) is incorrect because the sum of the temperatures is not relevant to the derived relationship.
- **Option C**: \(\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2}\) is incorrect because the denominator includes \((T_1 T_2)^2\), which does not match the derived equation.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
