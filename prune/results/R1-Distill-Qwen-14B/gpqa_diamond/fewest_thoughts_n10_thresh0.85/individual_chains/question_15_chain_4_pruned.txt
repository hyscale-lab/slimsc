Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and probabilities. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll think it out.

So the question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets have the same minimum mass and are detected via the RV method. But their orbital periods are different, with Planet_1's period being three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Wait, but same radii? Interesting. So same size, but different massesâ€”Planet_1's star is more massive.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet relative to the orbital distance. The formula for the transit probability (P) is something like (R_p / a) / (R_s), where R_p is the planet's radius, R_s the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or wait, maybe it's more accurately (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (something involving the orbital parameters). Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / a) divided by (R_s). Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1/(a/R_s))? Because the transit depends on how likely the orbital plane is aligned so that the planet passes in front of the star. The probability is roughly (R_p / R_s) * (1/(a/(R_s))) )? Or wait, maybe I should think about the formula.

Wait, the probability of transit is approximately (R_p / a) / (R_s / a) ), which simplifies to R_p / R_s. Oh wait, that can't be. Because the probability also depends on the alignment. Right, the probability is actually given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but more accurately, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block divided by the area of the star, but that's more complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the transit probability formula. I
