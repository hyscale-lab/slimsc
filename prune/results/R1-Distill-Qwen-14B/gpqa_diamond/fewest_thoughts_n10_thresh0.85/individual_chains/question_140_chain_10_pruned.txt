Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, wait. If a molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, what could that be? Let me think. Protons and neutrons are subatomic particles in the nucleus. So for a molecule, each atom contributes to the total. Wait, but gas W is likely a molecule, so maybe it's a diatomic molecule. 

Wait, wait. The problem says the molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, each molecule has some number of atoms, maybe just one atom if it's a monoatomic gas. But for a molecule, like O2 or something else.

Wait, the total number of protons and neutrons in the molecule would be the same. Let me think: for example, let's say a molecule is H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So two H atoms would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. But 2 ≠ 0, so that doesn't fit. What about O2? Each O is 8 protons, 8 neutrons (if it's the common isotope O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons (8*2) and 16 neutrons (8*2). So same number of protons and neutrons. That fits. So gas W is likely O2, oxygen gas.

Wait, but oxygen gas is O2. So each O atom has 8 protons. Neutrons for O-16 are 8. So each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Two O atoms would make 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So 16 each, same number. So W is O2.

But wait, another possibility is CO2? No, because each CO2 molecule is a single molecule, but the number of protons and neutrons would be much higher. Alternatively, maybe it's another diatomic gas. Let me think: maybe Cl2? Chlorine-35 has 17 protons and 18 neutrons. So each Cl atom has 17 p and 18 n. For Cl2, 34 p and 36 n. Not equal. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a noble gas like Ar. Argon is monoatomic, with Ar having 18 protons and 22 neutrons (Ar-40 is the most common). So Ar has 18 p and 22 n. So in the molecule (just one Ar atom), 18 vs 22 — not same. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe it's another molecule, like H2O? No, because H2O is a triatomic molecule. Let's see: H is 1 p, 0 n each. O has 8p, 8n. So H2O: 2 H (2p, 0n) plus O (8p,8n) → total 10p, 8n → nope, not same.

Wait, maybe it's NH3? No, that's not a gas under standard conditions. Wait, wait, but the question says that W is a gas released when X reacts with Y. Another possibility is CO. Let me see: C has 6p, 6n (if it's C-12). O has 8p, 8n (O-16). So CO has 14p and 14n. So total p and n in CO molecule: 14 each. So that would fit as well. Hmm. So W could be CO or O2. Or maybe another diatomic like N2? N has 7p, 7n (N-14). N2 would have 14p, 14n. So same. So W could be N2, O2, or CO.

Wait, but what's the reaction? Substance X reacts with Y violently, releasing W. So maybe it's an acid-base reaction. Let me think about what's happening.

The precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, so just above freezing. What has a melting point near that? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? No, wait. Wait, let me think: water freezes at 273 K (0 degrees C), and its melting point is the same. Wait, no, melting point is the same as freezing point — it's the temperature where solid and liquid coexist. So 277 K is about 4°C. What substance has a melting point near there? Maybe something like NaOH? No, NaOH's melting point is higher. Or perhaps something like NaNO3? No, sodium nitrate's melting point is
