Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's positioned geometrically. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I think I've seen something like this before. I'm pretty sure that when a density matrix is a mixture of the basis states like this, it represents a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>. So this might be a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Wait, what's a completely mixed state? Oh right, for a single qubit, the maximally mixed state is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So ρ here is exactly that. Now, how does that translate to a geometrical position in the qubits space?

I recall that in the Bloch sphere representation, a qubit state can be visualized as a point on the surface of a sphere. For a pure state, it's on the surface, and for a mixed state, it's inside. The completely mixed state, which is this case, should be at the center of the Bloch sphere. Because the Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by r = [x, y, z], where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. For the maximally mixed state, all the off-diagonal terms are zero, and the diagonal terms are ½ each.

Wait, let me be precise. The density matrix in general can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (x, y, z). The maximally mixed state would have r = 0 because ρ becomes (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So in that case, the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would be the center. Option B is (0,0,1), which I think is the state |0> perhaps? Or maybe |+> or something else. Wait, no, |0> is (1,0,0) in Bloch sphere coordinates? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: the standard basis states are |0> which is the north pole of the Bloch sphere, so that would correspond to (0,0,1), and |1> is (0,0,-1).

Wait, no, wait. The Bloch sphere uses the z-axis for the spin. So the state |0> is represented as the point (0,0,1), and |1> is (0,0,-1). But when you have a mixed state, like (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is a completely mixed state, the Bloch vector is zero, so it's at the origin. So the position is (0,0,0), which is option C.

Wait, let me double-check. The density matrix ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. The expectation value for the Pauli matrices would be:

For σx: Tr(ρ σx) = (1/2)(<0|σx|0> + <1|σx|1>). But σx flips the states, so <0|σx|0> is 0, same for <1|σx|1>. So x=0.

Similarly for y and z. Wait, the z expectation is Tr(ρ σz) = (1/2)(<0|σz|0> + <1|σz|1>). σz |0> is |0>, so <0|σz|0> is 1. Similarly, σz |1> is -|1>, so <1|σz|1> is -1. So 1/2 (1 + (-1)) = 0. So z is 0.

Wait, so x is 0, y is 0, z is 0. So the vector r is (0,0,0). That must be option C.

Another way to see this is that the density matrix in the computational basis is diagonal with entries 0.5 and 0.5. So ρ = diag(0.5, 0.5). The general form for a single qubit density matrix is [[ (1 + z)/2, (x - iy)/2 ], [ (x + iy)/2, (1 - z)/2 ]]. So here, comparing, (1+z)/2 = 0.5 => z=0. Similarly, (1-z)/2 = 0.5, which also gives z=0. The off-diagonal terms are zero, so x=0 and y=0. So the vector is (0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right),
\]

which represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the position of a quantum state is determined by the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), where the components correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\), respectively.

For the given density matrix:

1. The expectation value of \(\sigma_x\) is \(\text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x) = 0\), as the off-diagonal terms of \(\rho\) are zero.
2. The expectation value of \(\sigma_y\) is also \(\text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y) = 0\).
3. The expectation value of \(\sigma_z\) is \(\text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z) = 0\), since \(\rho\) is diagonal with equal probabilities for \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. This is the geometrical position of the completely mixed state. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** \((1,1,0)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **Option B** \((0,0,1)\): Incorrect, as this represents the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not a mixed state.
- **Option C** \((0,0,0)\): Correct, as this is the center of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the completely mixed state.
- **Option D** \((1,1,1)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to any valid quantum state.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
