Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms depends on temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution is involved here.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. That must mean that star_1 is hotter because higher temperatures would excite more atoms to higher energy levels.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, 1.38 is a familiar number. That's close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, so the energy difference ΔE is equal to k*T, right? Wait, no. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So the probability of being in an excited state is proportional to that exponential.

So the ratio of the excited states between the two stars would relate to their temperatures. Let me write that down. The ratio of excitation levels (n1/n2) is given as 2. So n1 = 2 * n2. But wait, the excitation probability is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So for each star, the excitation level is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, no. Wait, the excitation level is the number of atoms in the excited state. The ratio between star_1 and star_2 would be (n1/n2) = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)).

Wait, let me make sure. The excitation ratio is n_upper/n_lower, but wait, in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference (upper - lower). So if star_1 has twice as excited (i.e., higher n_upper?), so n1_upper/n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and similarly for star_2. But the question says that the excitation
