Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about a star similar to the Sun. It has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When they observe this star, they see brightness variations because the spots rotate into and out of view. These variations can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The task is to find what radius a hypothetical exoplanet would need to have so that its signal in the star's light curve is the same amplitude as the spots' effect. And importantly, the question says, "if the star was not covered by spots"—so I think that means we're comparing the effect of the planet to the effect of the spots.

Hmm, I remember that the brightness variation when a planet transits a star is given by the formula (Rp/Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet relative to the star, and since flux is proportional to area, the change in brightness is (Rp/Rstar)^2 as a fraction.

But wait, the spots are a bit different. The star isn't uniformly bright because parts are cooler (spots) and hotter (maybe the rest isn't specified, but the spots are 5000 K here, I think—wait, no, the Teff is 6000, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000 K? Or is it 1000 K difference, so spots are 6000-1000=5000 K.)

But how does the spot coverage affect the brightness variations? Well, the spots are dark, so when they are on the surface, they make the star appear dimmer. But when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. The brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature relative to the rest of the star.

Wait, but the problem is about rotational modulation. So when the star rotates, the spots come into the line of sight and then go away. The amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the total area of the spots and the temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star.

So the effective brightness change would be the sum of each spot's contribution. Each spot contributes a change in brightness depending on how much it blocks the star's light and how much its own brightness differs.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so when a spot is facing us, it contributes less flux. So the star's brightness will dip as the spots rotate into view.

Alternatively, when the star isn't spotted, a planet would block the star's light, causing a dip equal to (Rp/Rstar)^2. But the spots are causing a similar effect but in a different way.

Wait, the problem says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to that of a planet. Now, the question is, to get the same amplitude in brightness variation, what would the planet's radius need to be relative to the star?

So the problem is comparing the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet. So I need to compute the amplitude from the spots and set it equal to the amplitude from the planet, then solve for Rp/Rstar.

First, I should model the brightness variation caused by the spots.

The star emits a total flux F. Each spot has a certain area and emits at a different flux. The total flux when the star is viewed from Earth is F_total = F * (1 - filling factor) + F_spots.

Wait, no
