Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A) 10^-9 eV, B) 10^-11 eV, C) 10^-4 eV, D) 10^-8 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

In this case, the lifetimes given are the uncertainty in time (Δt) for each state. Wait, but wait—each state has its own lifetime. Oh, but wait, when we're talking about the energy difference between the two states, perhaps we should consider the uncertainty in the energy of each state to determine if they can be distinguished.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference (E2 - E1) between the two states. To distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, I suppose. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty from the lifetime might make it hard to tell them apart.

So, let's think: for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ΔE = ħ / (2Δt). Or wait, the exact formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt).

Wait, but actually, the uncertainty principle can be written as ΔE * τ ≥ ħ/2, where τ is the lifetime. So for each state, the energy uncertainty is about ħ/(2τ). So for state 1 with τ1 =1e-9 sec, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1). Similarly for state 2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2).

But wait, the energy difference between E2 and E1 is ΔE = E2 - E1. To resolve them, this ΔE should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties in E for each state, right? Because otherwise, the energy levels might overlap in their
