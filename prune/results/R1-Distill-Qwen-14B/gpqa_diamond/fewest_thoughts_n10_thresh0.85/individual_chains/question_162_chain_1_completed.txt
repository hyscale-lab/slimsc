Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a two-dimensional metric because it has dx and dy terms. So maybe this is a 2D space described by this line element.

I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor tells us about the geometry of spacetime. But here, since it's just dx and dy, it's probably a two-dimensional surface. Also, pseudosphere suggests it's a hyperbolic surface, which has negative curvature. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

The question is asking about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Pseudospheres are like the hyperbolic equivalents of spheres. The area of a sphere in 2D (which is a circle) is 2πr. But for hyperbolic surfaces, I think the area gets tricky because hyperbolic space is non-compact, meaning it extends infinitely. Oh wait, but pseudospheres are finite in some way, right? Or maybe not.

Wait, let me think about the metric again. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which looks similar to the metric of a sphere. Like, in spherical coordinates, the metric is (dr² + r² dθ²), but this is different because the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So when x² + y² approaches 4 from below, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric blow up. So this might be a coordinate system that covers a finite area.

Wait, but in 2D, the area element is usually sqrt(det g) dx dy. Let me calculate that. The metric here is diagonal, with the same coefficients for dx² and dy². The determinant of the metric tensor g would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) multiplied by the determinant of the identity matrix, which is 1. So det g is (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

So the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, sqrt of (32^2)/(4 - x² - y²)^2) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

So to find the total area, I need to integrate this over the region where the metric makes sense. The denominator 4 - x² - y² must be positive, so x² + y² < 4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, so integrating dA over x² + y² <4 would mean integrating 32/(4 - r²) over the area. Let me switch to polar coordinates because it's symmetric. So in polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The area A is the integral of 32/(4 - r²) * r dr from 0 to 2, multiplied by the integral over θ, which is 2π.

So let's compute the radial integral first. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32/u) * (-du/2) from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (32)(-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0. The negative sign flips the limits, so it's (16) ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4.

∫1/u du is ln|u| + C. Evaluated from 0 to4: ln(4) - ln(0).

But ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral becomes (16)(ln4 - (-infty)) which is infinite. So the area is 2π multiplied by an infinite quantity. So the total area is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right. Did I do the substitution correctly? Let me check the substitution again. When r approaches 2 from below, u approaches zero from above. So the integral as r approaches 2, u approaches 0, and 1/u approaches infinity.

So yeah, the area element blows up at r=2, making the integral diverge. So the total area would be infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, wait. Pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature. But in this case, the metric I'm looking at is in two dimensions, so perhaps it's a hyperbolic plane? Or a portion of it.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting confused with the terms here. A pseudosphere is a surface with infinite extent in some directions, so its area would be infinite. So the area would be D) +infty.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) indicates that the metric is only defined for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. The area element \(dA\) is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor, which gives:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\) is straightforward. For the radial integral, let \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\), and the limits change from \(r = 0\) (\(u = 4\)) to \(r = 2\) (\(u = 0\)). Substituting, the radial integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr = 16 \int_4^0 \frac{-1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du\) diverges because \(\ln(u)\) approaches \(-\infty\) as \(u \to 0\). Thus, the total area is infinite. This reflects the fact that the pseudosphere, as described by this metric, has infinite extent and area.
