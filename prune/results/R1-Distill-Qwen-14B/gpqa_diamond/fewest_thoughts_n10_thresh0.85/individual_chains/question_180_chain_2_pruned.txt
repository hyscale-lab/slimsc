Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And they have negligible mass, so I don't have to worry about any kinetic energy or motion here, just potential energy.

The setup is a bit specific. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, and the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So I guess all the 12 are on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, okay. So I'm thinking that this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because the particles are charged and placed in space, they have potential energy due to their positions relative to each other.

Wait, but since the system is isolated, we can consider the total potential energy. I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions while considering the existing charges.

But wait, wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. But each of these 12 is also a charge, so each other one will exert a force on the others, but since they're constrained, I can't move them around. So the potential energy of the system must consider the interactions between all pairs.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Hmm. Let me think. So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. For a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum over all pairs of the potential energy between each pair.

So for each charge at 2 m from P, which is fixed, the potential energy between that charge and the fixed one
