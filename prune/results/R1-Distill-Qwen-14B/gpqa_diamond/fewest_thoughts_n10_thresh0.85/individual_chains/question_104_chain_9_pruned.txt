Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. It's about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. 

The question says that two stars with the same mass as our Sun each have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the key here is that the stars have the same mass, and the planets' masses are similar, so maybe their orbital periods relate to the RV signals detected.

The RV method tells us about the velocity of the star due to the planet. The shift in the spectral lines corresponds to the star's velocity. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity of the star. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does this relate to the orbital period of the planet?

I think the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, usually denoted as K. The formula for K is K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) ... Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

Since the orbits are circular (e=0), that simplifies to (1 - e²)^0.5 = 1, so we can ignore that. Also, since the planet masses are similar to Neptune and much less than the star's mass (which is like the Sun), M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_* )^(2/3) )

Wait, no, let me
