Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember from my studies that molecules can have both rotational and vibrational energy states. The question is about what happens when a photon is absorbed, causing the molecule to move to the next lowest energy state. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, if it's in the fundamental state, maybe both the vibrational and rotational modes are in their ground states.

The molecule is made of atoms X and Y with masses Mx and My. I know that when dealing with diatomic molecules, it's often useful to calculate the reduced mass because that's what comes into play in rotational and vibrational energy models. Oh right, the reduced mass μ is calculated as (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let me calculate that.

Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. So, μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu. But wait, I need to convert amu to kilograms because the standard unit for mass in physics equations is kg. I remember that 1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So, μ = 1.818 * 1.660539e-27 kg. Let me calculate that: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.01e-27 kg. Okay, so the reduced mass is about 3.01e-27 kg.

Next, the molecular bond length R is given as 2 angstroms. Angstroms to meters, right? 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

The angular frequency of vibration ω is 4e14 rad/s. That's given, so I don't need to calculate that.

Now, the question is about the photon's momentum needed to switch the molecule to the next lowest energy state. I think that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. But wait, the molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule will transition to the next higher energy state. But which state? The next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

Wait, the question says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right, the next state would be the one with the next higher energy, which is the first excited state. But for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are quantized and the transitions are usually considered in terms of the selection rules. For the rotation-vibration model, the transitions can be either vibrational or rotational, but maybe the lowest energy transition is the one with the least energy change.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the vibrational transition because the rotational transitions might require lower
