Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, it says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform in what way? I think it means that their number density is the same throughout space, so no clustering. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. 

Parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is closer than one with 0.5 parsecs. Because parallax p = 1/d, where d is distance. So as d increases, p decreases.

The question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So the number of stars in a slice of parallax width delta_p. How does that number change with p?

I remember from my studies that in a uniform distribution, the number of stars you can observe depends on the volume of space they occupy. The volume relates to distance, and parallax is inversely related to distance. So how does the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d depend on d?

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at distance d is proportional to the surface area of that shell, which is 4πd². Since the number density of stars is uniform, the number of stars in the shell is n_stars = n * (4πd² * thickness), where n is the number density.

But the thickness in terms of distance is delta_d. But the question is about parallax, which is p = 1/d. So delta_p is the change in parallax. I think I need to relate delta_p to delta_d.

Let me compute delta_p in terms of delta_d.

p = 1/d → dp = -1/(d²) dd → delta_p ≈ - (1/d²) delta_d. Since delta_d is positive when moving outward (d increasing), delta_p is negative. But since we're talking about a small range, the sign doesn't matter for the magnitude. So |delta_p| = (1/d²) delta_d → delta_d = d² delta_p.

So the number of stars in a thin shell of parallax p is:

n_stars = n * 4π d² * delta_d
= n * 4π d² * (d² delta_p)
= n * 4π d^4 delta_p

But wait, wait, because delta_p is the range of parallax, and we're considering a thin shell. Hmm, let's think again. Oh wait, for each p, the corresponding d is 1/p. So substituting d = 1/p.

So n_stars = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * ( (1/p^2) delta_p ) )

Wait, that's not right. Wait, delta_d = d² delta_p, and d = 1/p. So delta_d = (1/p^2) delta_p.

So substituting into n_stars:

n_stars = n * 4π d² * delta_d
= n *4π (1/p^2) * (1/p² delta_p)
= n *4π (1/p^4) delta_p

So the number of stars per unit parallax (delta_p) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit range of p decreases with p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So as p increases, the number of stars per unit p (i.e., per delta_p) decreases as 1/p^4.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 1/plx^4 → that seems to match.

Wait, but I thought the number of stars in a volume increases with distance squared, but since we're looking at per unit parallax, the relation changes.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me recheck.

n_stars per unit p (delta_p) is n *4π d² * (delta_d) / delta_p.

Wait, no, because delta_d is (1/p^2) delta_p. So the expression is:

n_stars = n *4π d² * delta_d
= n *4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2 delta_p)
= n *4π (1/p^4) delta_p

So per unit delta_p, the number is n *4π (1/p^4). So the number per unit p is inversely proportional to p^4.

So the correct option is A) ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another approach: the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV. The volume element in spherical coordinates is dV = 4π d² dd. Since we're considering a range of parallax, which relates to d.

So for a given p, d is 1/p. So dd = - (1/p²) dp. The negative just indicates direction, but for magnitude, it's (1/p²) dp.

So the number of stars in a thin shell between p and p + dp is:

n_stars = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp)
= n *4π (1/p^4) dp

So the number is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit p (dp) is 1/p^4.

So the correct answer is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 \), multiplied by the thickness \( \Delta d \) of the shell. Since the number density of stars is uniform, the number of stars in the shell is:

\[
N \propto n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \cdot \Delta d
\]

To relate this to parallax, we use \( d = 1/p \), so \( \Delta d = d^2 \Delta p \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \) and \( \Delta d = (1/p^2) \Delta p \) into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N \propto n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{p^2} \Delta p\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
N \propto \frac{n \cdot 4\pi}{p^4} \cdot \Delta p
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( \Delta p \)) is inversely proportional to \( p^4 \). Therefore, as \( p \) increases, the number of stars per unit \( p \) decreases as \( 1/p^4 \).

From the given options:

- **A) ~ 1/plx^4**: This matches the derived relationship.
- **B) ~ 1/plx^2**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p^2 \).
- **C) ~ 1/plx^1**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p \).
- **D) ~ 1/plx^3**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p^3 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.
