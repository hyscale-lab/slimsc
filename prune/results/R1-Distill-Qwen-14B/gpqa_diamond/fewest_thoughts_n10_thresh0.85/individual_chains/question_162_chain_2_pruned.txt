Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But here we're talking about a pseudosphere, which I think is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, it's a surface with constant negative curvature. But how does that relate to the metric given? I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

The question is asking about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Oh wait, I think the area of a pseudosphere is similar to a sphere's area, but with a negative sign or something. Wait, no. Wait, the area of a sphere is 4πr², right? So for a pseudosphere, maybe it's similar but different.

Wait, but I'm getting confused between pseudosphere and hyperbolic space. Because a pseudosphere can be thought of as a surface of constant negative curvature, like the tractricoid. But the metric given here looks like it's in two dimensions. Let me see.

So the metric is in terms of x and y, and the coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me rewrite that: ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), if I switch to polar coordinates. Because sometimes it's easier to work in polar coordinates when dealing with symmetry around a point.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The denominator is 4 - x² - y², which can be written as 4 - r² where r² = x² + y². So substituting that, the metric becomes ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). So this looks like a two-dimensional metric, so maybe it's the metric for a surface embedded in three dimensions, but perhaps here it's the metric of a 2D surface.

But I'm not entirely certain about that. Alternatively, maybe the metric is in a higher dimension, but I think it's 2D here.

So, the area of a surface in 2D can be found using the metric. The area element is sqrt(g) dr dθ, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Wait, but in 2D, for a metric in the form ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) dθ², the area element is (1/2π) ∫ A(r) * B(r) dr dθ, integrated over θ from 0 to 2π and r from some range.

Alternatively, the area element is sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ} - g_{rθ}^2) dr dθ. Since the metric is diagonal here, g_{rθ} is zero, so the area element becomes sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) dr dθ.

So substituting, g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²), and g_{θθ} = 32 r²/(4 - r²). So the area element would be sqrt( (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) dr dθ.
