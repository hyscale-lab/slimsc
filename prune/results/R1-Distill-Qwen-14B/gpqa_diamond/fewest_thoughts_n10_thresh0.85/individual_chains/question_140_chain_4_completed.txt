Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, so that must mean it's a noble gas because they have complete electron shells. Wait, no, not necessarily. Let me think: a molecule where protons equal neutrons—so for a diatomic gas, maybe it's something like O2 or N2? No, wait, because O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons would make O-16, but O2 would have 16 protons total? No, wait, each O atom has 8 protons. Oh, wait, the molecule's protons and neutrons are equal. So each atom in the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, maybe it's a monoatomic gas? Like, if it's He (helium), each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So protons (2) equals neutrons (2). That fits. Or maybe another noble gas. Let's see: Ne has 10 protons and 10 neutrons (if it's Ne-20), so that would also fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule with multiple atoms but same number of protons and neutrons in each atom.

But the problem says the gas molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, the sum of protons (which is the atomic number) and the total neutrons in the molecule.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. The molecule's protons would be the sum of protons from each atom, and same for neutrons. But the molecule's protons and neutrons are equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's not about each atom but the total for the molecule. For example, O2: each O has 8 protons. So two O atoms would have 16 protons. The neutrons would be 8 per atom as well (if O-16), so 16 neutrons. So 16 each for protons and neutrons. So yeah, O2 would fit. Or maybe N2: each N has 7 protons, so two would make 14. If each N is N-14 (7 protons, 7 neutrons), then N2 has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That works too.

But the question says that upon the reaction, a precipitate G forms. When heated, G releases B, and the melting point of B is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, so room temperature is about 298 K, so 277 is a bit lower. What substances have a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or perhaps something else. Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.

Let me go back. The reaction is between substance X and liquid Y. The product is a precipitate G, which when heated gives B. The gas W is released. Also, substance X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements, which is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Oh, wait, the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about possible reactions. If X reacts with a liquid Y to produce a precipitate and a gas. A violent reaction suggests something exothermic, maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid? Alternatively, maybe a metal reacting with water, but that's usually not so violent unless it's something like potassium or sodium.

Wait, but let's think about what the precipitate G could be. When G is heated, it gives B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. Or maybe it's a sulfide or something else. Wait, but the melting point of B is around 4°C. That's just above the freezing point of water, so maybe B is a compound that's solid at lower temps, melts just above 0. Hmm, like maybe ammonium nitrate? Because ammonium nitrate can be a solid. Wait, but melting point for ammonium nitrate is around 169°C. No, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe something like ice? No, ice melts at 0°C, but 277 K is about 4°C, so maybe a different compound.

Wait, another angle. The product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids are like acetic acid, which has a ketone group. When acetic acid reacts with something—maybe a base—it forms a salt. But how does that relate to substance X? Maybe X is a base like NaOH or KOH.

Wait, also, the gas W has same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. Let's think about possible gases. He (helium) has 2 protons, 2 neutrons. So He is a possibility. Ne has 10 each. Ar has 18 each (Ar-40). But wait, Ar's atomic number is 18, so if it's Ar-40, then yes, 18 protons and 22 neutrons? No, wait, Ar is Z=18, so Ar-40 would have 18 protons, 22 neutrons. So protons=18, neutrons=22. Not equal. So that's out.

Wait, maybe CO2? CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons if 12C) and two O (each 8 protons, 8 neutrons if 16O). So the molecule would have (6 + 2*8) =22 protons, and (6 + 2*8)=22 neutrons. So 22 each. That fits. But wait, CO2's molecule isn't monoatomic. So the molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in total. So that would satisfy the condition. But is CO2 a gas released in this reaction?

Alternatively, what about H2O? Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (assuming H-1), and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So H2O would have (2*1 +8) =10 protons and (2*0 +8)=8 neutrons. So 10 and 8, not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another option: N2. Each N atom is N-14, so 7 protons and 7 neutrons. So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That fits. So gas W could be N2. But what reaction would produce N2? Maybe decomposition of something.

Alternatively, maybe gas W is CH4? No, that has 6 protons (C) and 4 H. So 6 protons, 4 neutrons (if each H is H-1 and C is 12C: 6 neutrons). 6 + 4 = 10? No, wait, I'm mixing up. Wait, the molecule's protons and neutrons. For CH4: C is 6 protons, 6 neutrons (12C). Each H is 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So total protons: 6 +4=10. Neutrons:6 +0=6. 10 vs 6. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Let me think about another approach. The precipitate G when heated gives B. And B has a melting point near 277 K (4°C). So B is a solid that melts at about 4°C. What's a common compound that fits this?

Wait, ammonium nitrate has a melting point around 169°C, which is way higher. Sodium nitrate's melting point is about 327°C. Hmm. Maybe something like NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate)? Its melting point is around 270°C. Close, but not exactly 277. Or ammonium chloride? I think its melting point is around 334°C. Hmm. Maybe it's something else.

Wait, what about ice? Ice melts at 0°C, but 277 K is 4°C. Maybe B is a hydrated salt? For example, calcium nitrate tetrahydrate melts at about 27°C. Not quite. Or maybe it's not a salt. Maybe B is something like paraffin wax, but that's more about softening than melting. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal. For example, mercury has a melting point of about 234 K (-39°C), which is lower. Oh, but wait, 277 K is 4°C. So maybe B is a hydrate. Wait, another thought: What if B is a solid that's just about to melt at room temperature? Maybe it's a solid with a low melting point, like camphor? Or perhaps it's a solid that's a byproduct of the reaction.

Wait, maybe G is a carbonate. Suppose X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid Y, producing CO2 gas. Then the precipitate G could be a metal hydroxide. But when heated, the metal hydroxide would decompose into metal oxide and water. Hmm, but that would release water vapor, not B. Unless B is the metal oxide. But why would the metal oxide have a melting point of 277 K? That seems low for a metal oxide. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is an acid. For example, X could be a carbonate reacting with H2SO4, which is a liquid (concentrated sulfuric acid). The reaction would produce CO2 gas, and the precipitate G might be something else. Wait, but if X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, reacting with H2SO4: Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. But that's a neutralization reaction and wouldn't produce a precipitate unless one of the products is insoluble. So maybe Y is not an acid but something else.

Wait, another possibility: X is a sulfide, reacting with an acid to produce H2S gas. But H2S has 2 protons and 2*0 neutrons (since S is 32S, which has 16 neutrons. Wait, no, H2S would have (2 H with 1 proton each, 0 neutrons) and S with 16 protons and 16 neutrons (for S-32). So total protons:2+16=18. Neutrons:0+16=16. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if the gas is He, then the molecule is He, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. That fits. So gas W is helium. But when would a reaction produce He? That's more of a nuclear reaction, not a typical chemical reaction. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe gas W is O2. O2 has 16 protons (8 per O atom) and 16 neutrons (8 per O atom, if O-16). So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits. So W is O2. So the reaction produces oxygen gas.

Hmm, what reaction produces O2? Maybe the decomposition of a peroxide, like H2O2 → 2H2O + O2↑. But in that case, the precipitate would be H2O, which is a liquid. Or perhaps a metal peroxide reacting with an acid, releasing O2.

Wait, but the precipitate G, when heated, gives B. So if G is a metal oxide, heating it might not change it. Or perhaps G is a carbonate. Wait, maybe G is a carbonate that upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. But then W would be CO2, but earlier I thought CO2 doesn't fit the protons and neutrons condition. Wait, let's check CO2 again.

In CO2, each O is O-16 (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons are 6 (from C) + 8*2 =6+16=22. Neutrons:6 (from C) +8*2=6+16=22. Because C-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So yes, CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that fits. So W could be CO2.

So back to the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce CO2, G (precipitate), and perhaps some other products. For example, if X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. The reaction would produce CO2, water, and a salt. But if Y is a strong acid and the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate.

Wait, but X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is a metal with a heavier isotope. For example, chlorine has a heavier isotope, but in what compound? Maybe NaCl, but the heavier isotope would be in Cl. But wait, X is a substance used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Oh, wait, NaOH is a reagent, but maybe it's something else.

Wait, the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So when a keto acid (like acetic acid) reacts with X, the product has 2 O atoms. Let's think about possible reactions. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. If X is something like NaOH, then the product would be sodium acetate, which has O from the acetate ion. So sodium acetate has O in the acetate group. But sodium acetate has more than 2 O atoms. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, if X is something like SOCl2. Wait, but SOCl2 is used in organic chemistry, like converting carboxylic acids to acid chlorides. So when a keto acid (like CH3COOH) reacts with SOCl2, it produces CH3COCl, SO2, and HCl. But the product (CH3COCl) has two O atoms. Wait, no, CH3COCl has Cl instead of OH, so the structure is CH3COCl. That has two oxygen atoms: one in the carbonyl and one in the Cl (but Cl is a substituent). Wait, no, the carbonyl is O, and the Cl is a single atom. So the molecule has one O (from the carbonyl). Hmm, not two.

Wait, maybe X is something else. Let's think about the reaction producing a product with two O atoms. Maybe X is a base that, when reacting with a keto acid, forms a salt with two O atoms. For example, if X is NH3, a weak base. Acetic acid and NH3 would form ammonium acetate, which has O in the acetate. But ammonium acetate has more than two O atoms.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like methanol (CH3OH). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is something that when reacting with a keto acid, forms a hemiacetal or something, but that's probably stretching it.

Wait, maybe the product is a hemiacetal, which has two O atoms. Or perhaps it's a diester or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the initial reaction. X reacts with Y to produce a precipitate G and gas W (CO2). So X might be a carbonate. Y could be a strong acid, like H2SO4 or HCl. The reaction would produce CO2, water, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate.

So, if X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), Y is H2SO4, the reaction would be: Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. Sodium sulfate is soluble, so that wouldn't precipitate. So perhaps X is a different carbonate, like calcium carbonate. Y could be HCl. The reaction would be CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. CaCl2 is soluble, so again no precipitate. Hmm. Maybe Y is not an acid but something else.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. For example, if X is a non-soluble carbonate, and Y is a solution of a hydroxide. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, what if Y is a solution of a nitrate? Not sure.

Wait, another angle. The precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. So, for example, suppose G is copper carbonate. Heating it would produce copper oxide and CO2. But then B would be copper oxide, which has a much higher melting point. Hmm.

Alternatively, if G is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), heating it would produce Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So B would be Na2CO3, which has a melting point around 842°C. That's way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps G is a different kind of compound. Maybe it's a sulfite? Heating a sulfite would produce a sulfate and SO2 gas. But I'm not sure about the melting points.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a nitrate. Heating it would decompose into something else. For example, Pb(NO3)2 decomposes upon heating, but I'm not sure about the products or melting points.

Wait, maybe G is a hydrate. For example, copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) has a melting point around 25°C. Wait, 277 K is 4°C, so that's close. Wait, but the melting point of CuSO4·5H2O is about 25°C, which is 298 K. Hmm, not exact. But maybe another hydrate. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound.

Wait, what if G is a carbonate of a metal that forms a metal oxide upon heating, and the oxide has a low melting point. For example, suppose G is MgCO3. Heating MgCO3 would produce MgO and CO2. MgO has a melting point of around 2800°C. That's way too high. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe B is not a metal oxide but something else. Let's think about another possibility. Suppose the precipitate G is a hydroxide. Heating it might dehydrate it into a metal oxide. For example, Fe(OH)3 when heated might form Fe2O3 and water. But Fe2O3 has a high melting point, so that's not matching.

Another thought: maybe the gas W is not CO2 but another molecule. Let's think of other possibilities. If W is H2, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (each H is H-1, so 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't fit. So no.

Wait, another possible gas: O3 (ozone). O3 has 3*(8 protons and 8 neutrons) =24 protons and 24 neutrons. So that fits. But ozone is a triatomic molecule, but the condition says molecule. So O3 would have 24 protons and 24 neutrons. So that could be a possibility. But what reaction produces ozone? Maybe an electrolysis reaction, but that's more industrial.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is Ne (neon). Ne has 10 protons and 10 neutrons (if Ne-20). So that fits. But how would a reaction produce Ne? That's more of a noble gas, which is unreactive, so probably not.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to think about the other parts of the problem. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. So one of its elements has a heavier isotope. For example, chlorine has 35Cl and 37Cl. So if X is NaCl, but why would it be used as a reagent in organic chemistry? Wait, NaCl is a reagent in some reactions, like the SN2 reactions, but not sure.

Wait, the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Hmm. Let me think about common reactions. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with something. If X is NaOH, then the product is sodium acetate, which has O in the acetate ion. Sodium acetate has two O in the acetate group, right? The formula is CH3COO-Na+. So in the acetate ion, there are two O atoms from the carboxylate group. Wait, but the acetate ion is CH3COO^- which has two O's in the COO part. So the product would have those two O's. So that fits. So when acetic acid reacts with X (like NaOH), the product is sodium acetate, which has two O atoms.

So X could be NaOH. But wait, NaOH is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, like in saponification or in elimination reactions. So that fits. Also, NaOH is known for incorporating a heavier isotope, like in the case of chlorine for NaCl, but wait NaOH is Na, O, H. H has a heavier isotope like D (deuterium), but that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, oxygen has heavier isotopes, but I'm not sure if that's what the question is referring to.

Wait, the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So in X's elements, one is a heavier isotope. For NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. Na is Na-23, O is O-16, H is H-1. So maybe X is something like D2O (deuterated water), but that's not NaOH. Alternatively, if X is NaOD, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like KCl, where Cl has a heavier isotope. But earlier thought that X is NaOH might not fit the isotope part. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. The product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So maybe the product is a hemiacetal or an acetal, but those are more about protecting carbonyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester. Wait, no, esters have more O's.

Wait, let's think of X as a base that can deprotonate the keto acid. So, for example, X could be NH3. Reacting with acetic acid would form ammonium acetate. But that has more O's.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like CH3ONa (sodium methoxide). Reacting with acetic acid would produce CH3OAc (methyl acetate?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal hydride. For example, NaH. Reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid) would deprotonate it to form acetate. So the product would be sodium acetate, which has two O's. That fits. So X could be NaH.

But does NaH incorporate a heavier isotope? Na has isotopes like Na-23 (most common) and Na-24 (less common). So if X is NaH, it's made of Na and H. Na is usually Na-23 (which has 11 protons, 12 neutrons), and H is usually H-1. So heavier isotopes could be present, but I'm not sure if that's what the question refers to.

Hmm, but NaH is a strong base used in organic chemistry, like in deprotonating compounds. So that fits. Also, when NaH reacts with water, it produces H2 (gas) and NaOH. So that could explain a violent reaction with a liquid Y, perhaps water. The reaction NaH + H2O → NaOH + H2↑. So gas W would be H2. But earlier, we thought W's protons and neutrons must be equal. H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit. So that's a problem.

So perhaps X isn't NaH. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, another thought: X is a carbonate, Y is a strong acid, producing CO2 gas. So W is CO2, which fits the protons and neutrons condition (22 each). Then, the precipitate G would be perhaps a sulfate or another salt. Wait, but if Y is H2SO4, and X is a carbonate, the reaction would produce sulfate, CO2, and water. If the sulfate is insoluble, it would precipitate. For example, CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4↓ + CO2↑ + H2O. CaSO4 is sparingly soluble, so it would precipitate. Then, when heated, CaSO4 would decompose? Not sure, because CaSO4 has a high melting point.

Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide. If X is a metal oxide reacting with an acid, but that would produce a salt and water, which wouldn't precipitate unless it's an insoluble salt.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to approach it differently.

So, the key points are:

1. X reacts with Y to produce gas W (same protons and neutrons in molecule), precipitate G.

2. G upon heating gives B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

3. X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

4. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

5. When a keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms.

Let me try to think of X as a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. Reacting with HCl would produce CO2 (W), CaCl2 (which is soluble, so no precipitate). That doesn't work.

Wait, maybe X is a sulfite. Reacting with H2SO4 would produce SO2 gas. But SO2 has 16 protons (S has 16, O has 8 each. 16 + 8*2 =40 protons? No, wait, SO2 has one S and two O atoms. So protons:16 (S) + 2*8 (O)=32. Neutrons:16 (S) + 2*8 (O)=32. So 32 each. That fits. So W could be SO2. Then, the reaction would be X (like CaSO3) + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + SO2↑ + H2O. CaSO4 is sparingly soluble, so precipitate G is CaSO4. When heated, CaSO4 doesn't decompose at normal temperatures, I think. So that might not fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, if X is a hydroxide. For example, X is NaOH, Y is a strong acid like H2SO4. Then, the reaction would produce Na2SO4, water, and no gas. So that doesn't produce a gas. Hmm.

Another angle: perhaps X is a metal nitride. Reacting with water would produce NH3 gas. But NH3 has 14 protons (N has 7, H has 1 each. 7 + 3=10 protons. Neutrons: N has 7-14? Wait, N-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. So each NH3 molecule has 10 protons and 7 neutrons (from N) plus 3 H (3 protons, 0 neutrons). So total protons:10, neutrons:7. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce C2H2 (acetylene), but I'm not sure about the protons and neutrons. C2H2 has 2*(6) + 2*(1) =14 protons. Neutrons: 2*(6) (from C) + 2*(0) (from H) =12. 14 vs 12. Not equal.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal azide. Reacting with something to produce N2 gas. But N2 has 14 protons and 14 neutrons if each N is N-14. So that fits.

So the reaction could be something like NaN3 reacting with H2SO4 to produce N2 gas, sodium sulfate, and water. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Then, precipitate G could be something else. But I'm not sure how that ties into B's melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps G is ammonium chloride. When heated, it decomposes into NH3 and HCl, but that's more about sublimation than melting. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: B has a melting point near 277 K (4°C). So it must be a solid at room temperature but melts just above 0°C. What about something like camphor? Or maybe it's a different kind of compound.

Wait, maybe B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point around 27°C. That's not 277 K, which is 4°C. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Maybe something like urea ((NH2)2CO), which has a melting point around 135°C. No, that's higher.

Wait, maybe B is a different product altogether. Let me think about the precipitate G. Suppose G is a sulfide. When heated, it could decompose into a metal and SO2 or another gas. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the product of the reaction between X and Y is a precipitate G and gas W. Suppose X is a metal nitrate, Y is a solution of a carbonate. The reaction could produce CO2 gas and a precipitate of a metal carbonate. For example, if X is AgNO3 and Y is Na2CO3, the reaction would produce Ag2CO3 (which is insoluble) and NaNO3. Wait, but Ag2CO3 is not very stable; it might decompose into Ag2O and CO2. So perhaps G is Ag2O, which when heated doesn't change much. But Ag2O has a melting point of 1530°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to summarize the information again.

Gas W: same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. Possibilities include O2 (16 each), N2 (14 each), CO2 (22 each), He (2 each), Ne (10 each), etc.

Precipitate G upon heating gives B, which has a melting point near 277 K (4°C).

Substance X is used in organic chemistry as a reagent, has a heavier isotope in one of its elements.

The product of X with a keto acid has 2 O atoms.

So, thinking about X again. If X is NaOH, which is used in organic reactions, contains Na, O, H. It can react with a keto acid like acetic acid to form sodium acetate, which has two O atoms in the acetate group. So that fits.

So when NaOH reacts with something (liquid Y), what happens? If Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, but that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, Y could be something else.

Wait, if X is NaOH and Y is a solution of a carbonate, like CaCO3, then the reaction could be: 2 NaOH + CaCO3 → Na2CO3 + Ca(OH)2. But Ca(OH)2 is a precipitate. When heated, Ca(OH)2 would decompose into CaO and H2O. CaO has a high melting point, around 2600°C. Not matching B's melting point.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a sulfide. NaOH + H2S → Na2S + H2O. No precipitate, unless it's an insoluble sulfide. Not sure.

Another possibility: X is NaOH, Y is a nitrate solution. NaOH + AgNO3 → NaNO3 + AgOH → AgOH may decompose into Ag2O and H2O. So precipitate G is Ag2O. When heated, Ag2O would decompose into Ag and H2O. But Ag has a melting point of 961°C, which is way higher.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about what the question is asking in the end. It says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. Considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, sum all heavier and lighter isotopes. So if X has elements A and B, with isotopes, we need to sum the lightest and heaviest isotopes' masses for each element and add them.

So, for example, if X is NaOH: Na has isotopes (like Na-23), O has O-16, H has H-1. The lightest would be H (1) and Na (23), the heaviest would be Na (23) and O (16?), but wait, O has heavier isotopes like O-18. So the heaviest isotope in X would be O-18 (18 mass). So the cumulative atomic masses would be lightest (H:1) + heaviest (O:18) =19. But looking at the options, 19 isn't an option. So perhaps this isn't the right track.

Wait, the options provided are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29. So perhaps the sum is one of these.

Let's think of another X. Suppose X is NH3. It's used in organic chemistry. Reacting with a keto acid could produce an ammonium salt, which would have certain oxygen atoms. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, X could be KNO3 (potassium nitrate), which is used as a reagent. But when it reacts with something, would it produce a gas with equal protons and neutrons? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: If X is NH4Cl (ammonium chloride), which is used in organic chemistry as a reagent. Reacting it with a strong base like NaOH would produce NH3 gas. But NH3 has 10 protons and 10 neutrons (wait, no. NH3 has 1 N (7 protons, 7 neutrons) and 3 H (1 each). So total protons:7+3=10. Neutrons:7+0=7. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps X is something else. Let's think about the isotopes again. If X has a heavier isotope, perhaps it's chlorine in NaCl. So X could be NaCl. When NaCl reacts with something, perhaps concentrated H2SO4, it could produce HCl gas. But HCl has 1 proton and 36 neutrons (Cl-35: 17 protons, 18 neutrons; Cl-37: 17, 20). So the gas would have varying protons and neutrons, but the molecule as a whole wouldn't necessarily have equal numbers. So that might not fit.

Wait, but if X is a compound that, when reacted, produces a gas with equal protons and neutrons. Let me think of another X. Maybe X is a carbonate, like K2CO3. Reacting with H2SO4 would produce CO2, K2SO4, and H2O. K2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is CaCO3. Reacting with HCl would produce CO2, CaCl2, and H2O. CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps X is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Reacting with H2SO4 would produce SO2 gas. SO2 has 16 protons (S) + 8*2 (O) =32 protons. Neutrons:16 (S) + 8*2=32. So 32 each. That fits. Then, the precipitate would be Na2SO4, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another carbonate. Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Maybe it's better to think about the possible answers. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. These numbers are the sums of two atomic masses. Let's think which pairs add up to these.

For example, option D is 29. Let's say the two elements are H and Cl. H is 1, Cl is 35 (approx). 1+35=36, not 29. Or maybe O (16) and Na (23). 16+23=39. Not 29. Or maybe C (12) and O (16). 12+16=28. Close to 29, but not exact.

Wait, another possibility: the lightest element is H (1), and the heaviest is Cl (35). 1+35=36. Not matching options.

Alternatively, maybe the elements are O (16) and F (19). 16+19=35. That's option A. Or O (16) and Ne (20). 16+20=36. Not matching.

Wait, another angle. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements. Suppose X is something like NaCl. Lightest element is Na (23), heaviest is Cl (35). 23+35=58. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X is something like H2O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). 1+16=17. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something with two different elements, each having multiple isotopes. For example, if X is NH3. The elements are N and H. The heaviest isotope of N is N-15 (15 mass), H is H-1 (1). The lightest is H (1) and N (14, but if considering isotopes, maybe N-14 is the most abundant). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, X could be something like CH3OH (methanol). The elements are C, H, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). 1+16=17. Not an option.

Hmm, maybe another approach. The sum of the lightest and heaviest atomic masses in X is one of the options. Let's think of elements that sum up to the options.

Option B is 25. So possible pairs: 1 (H) + 24 (Mg). Hmm, 24+1=25. So if X contains H and Mg, then the sum is 25. But what compound contains Mg and H? MgH2 is possible, but that's more of a ionic compound, not a reagent in organic chemistry.

Wait, another option: C (12) and O (13?). No, O is usually 16. 12+13=25. But O-13 isn't a common isotope.

Alternatively, maybe the elements are N (14) and H (1). 14+11=25? No, 14+11 is 25, but H is 1. So that doesn't add up.

Wait, another possibility: The sum is for the heaviest and lightest isotopes within the same element. For example, if X has Cl, which has isotopes around 35 and 37. So the lightest is 35 (Cl-35) and heaviest is 37 (Cl-37). 35+37=72. Not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the two lightest and heaviest elements in X. For example, if X has H and Cl. H is lightest (1), Cl is heaviest (35). 1+35=36. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about two atoms in X, each having their own lightest and heaviest isotopes. For example, if X is NaOH: Na has isotopes (23, 24, 25), O has (16), H has (1,2). So the lightest isotopes would be Na-23, O-16, H-1. The heaviest isotopes would be Na-25, O-18, H-2. So the sum would be Na's lightest (23) + H's lightest (1)=24. Or Na's heaviest (25) + H's heaviest (2)=27. Not matching options.

Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X, not isotopes. For example, if X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is Na (23). 1+23=24. Not an option.

Wait, another thought. If X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. The elements are Na, C, O. The lightest is C (12), the heaviest is Na (23). 12+23=35. Oh, option A is 35. So that could be the answer. But does that fit the other conditions?

Wait, let's see. If X is Na2CO3, which is sodium carbonate. It reacts with an acid Y, like H2SO4. The reaction would produce CO2 gas (which fits the condition, 22 protons and 22 neutrons), and a salt (Na2SO4) which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, that doesn't fit because the question says a precipitate forms.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2. Then, Na2CO3 + Ba(NO3)2 → BaCO3↓ + 2 NaNO3. BaCO3 is a precipitate. When heated, BaCO3 decomposes into BaO and CO2. BaO has a high melting point, so B's melting point wouldn't fit.

Hmm, but the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X would be C (12) and Na (23), sum 35. So if the answer is option A (35), that would make sense. But does X=Na2CO3 fit the other conditions?

Also, the product of a keto acid with Na2CO3 would be a sodium salt. For example, acetic acid (CH3COOH) + Na2CO3 → CH3COO-Na+ + NaHCO3. The product would be sodium acetate and sodium bicarbonate. Sodium acetate has two O's in the acetate group. So that fits the condition of the product having two O atoms.

Additionally, sodium carbonate is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, like in the production of soaps (saponification). So that fits.

But earlier, the reaction with Y produces a precipitate. So if Y is Ba(NO3)2, the precipitate is BaCO3. When heated, BaCO3 decomposes into BaO and CO2. BaO has a melting point of around 1500°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in thinking Y is an acid. What if Y is something else, like a solution of Pb(NO3)2? Then, Na2CO3 + Pb(NO3)2 → PbCO3↓ + 2 NaNO3. PbCO3 is a precipitate. When heated, PbCO3 decomposes into PbO and CO2. PbO has a melting point around 880°C. Still not matching.

Wait, another thought. Maybe Y is a solution of AgNO3. Na2CO3 + 2 AgNO3 → Ag2CO3 + 2 NaNO3. Ag2CO3 is a precipitate, but it's unstable and decomposes into Ag2O and CO2. Ag2O has a melting point of around 1530°C. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is not an acid but another carbonate. For example, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is CaCO3, but they wouldn't react in a way to produce a precipitate.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's go back to the initial reaction: X reacts with Y to produce gas W, which has equal protons and neutrons. If W is CO2, which fits, then the reaction must produce CO2.

So X could be a carbonate, Y an acid. Then, the precipitate would be the metal sulfate or another salt. But if X is Na2CO3 and Y is H2SO4, the product is Na2SO4, which is soluble, so no precipitate.

Wait, perhaps X is a different carbonate. For example, CaCO3. Reacting with HCl produces CO2, CaCl2 (soluble), and water. No precipitate.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is from another reaction. For example, if X is a hydroxide and Y is an acid, but then I don't think a precipitate would form unless it's a weak acid and strong base, but I'm not sure.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe I should just make an educated guess based on the clues. The sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is 35. That would correspond to C (12) and Na (23), which adds up to 35. So the answer would be option A) 35.

But earlier, the melting point of B didn't fit, but perhaps I'm missing something about B. Alternatively, maybe B is something else. But given the options, I think 35 is the likely answer.


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W (with equal protons and neutrons in its molecule) and forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (4°C). Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Additionally, the product of X with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. The task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include CO₂ (22 protons, 22 neutrons), N₂ (14 protons, 14 neutrons), or O₂ (16 protons, 16 neutrons). CO₂ is a strong candidate because it fits the condition and is commonly produced in reactions involving carbonates and acids.

2. **Precipitate G and B**: G is a precipitate formed during the reaction, and when heated, it releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K (4°C). This suggests B could be a hydrated salt or a compound with a low melting point. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating it might produce a metal oxide or another compound.

3. **Substance X**: X reacts with Y to produce CO₂ gas and a precipitate. X must incorporate a heavier isotope of one of its elements and be used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) is a strong candidate because it reacts with acids to produce CO₂, is used in organic chemistry, and its elements (Na, C, O) can include heavier isotopes (e.g., O-18).

4. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: When X reacts with a keto acid (e.g., acetic acid), the product contains 2 oxygen atoms. For example, if X is Na₂CO₃, the reaction with acetic acid could produce sodium acetate, which has 2 oxygen atoms in the acetate group.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The lightest element in X is hydrogen (H, atomic mass ≈ 1), and the heaviest is sodium (Na, atomic mass ≈ 23). The cumulative atomic masses of these elements sum to 1 + 23 = 24. However, if the heaviest element is chlorine (Cl, atomic mass ≈ 35), the sum would be 1 + 35 = 36. Based on the options provided, the most plausible answer is the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X being 35.

### Conclusion:
The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X are most consistent with the sum being 35. This aligns with the given options and the analysis of X as a carbonate (e.g., Na₂CO₃) or a compound containing heavier isotopes.
