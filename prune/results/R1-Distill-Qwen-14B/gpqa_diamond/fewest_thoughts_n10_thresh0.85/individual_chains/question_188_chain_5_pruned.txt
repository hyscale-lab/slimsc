Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal structures, right? It's like a distorted cube or something. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. Wait, rhombohedral usually has all angles equal, so that makes sense.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is given by Bragg's law or something related. Oh wait, no, Bragg's law is for diffraction. The formula I'm thinking of is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos α + 2ln cos beta + 2mn cos gamma), or something like that. Or maybe a different formula because I'm mixing up with something else.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) ), but wait, no, maybe the formula is d = (a² (h² + k² + l²) + ... ) all under a square root in the denominator. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by d_{hkl} = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + ... ) no, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, maybe it's d = (a)/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha )) ), but wait, the angles in a rhombohedral crystal... Wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

Wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is such that the vectors a, b, c have the same length, a = b = c = a0, and the angles between each pair are the same, alpha, beta, gamma. So in this case, a0 is the interatomic distance, which is given as 10 Angstroms. So a = b = c = 10 Angstroms.

So the question is about the (111) plane. So h=1, k=1, l=1.

The formula for d_{hkl} in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha (between b and c), beta (between a and c), gamma (between a and b) is:

d^2 = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + b^2 ...
