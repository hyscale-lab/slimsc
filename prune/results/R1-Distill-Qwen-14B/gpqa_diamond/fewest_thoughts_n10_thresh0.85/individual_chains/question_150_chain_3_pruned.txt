Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with NMR spectroscopy yet. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. So, let's see, the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let me figure out the degree of unsaturation. The formula for degree of unsaturation is Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, and X would be 0 since there's no halogen mentioned. So plugging in the numbers: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. Wait, that can't be right because degrees of unsaturation should be an integer. Hmm, maybe I did the formula wrong. Oh wait, maybe I should think about it as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Let me recalculate: 2*8=16, +2=18. Then subtract H (9) and X (0) so 18-9=9, then add N (1) so 10. 10/2 is 5. Oh yeah, so 5 degrees of unsaturation. That makes more sense. So, 5 degrees could be from a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees: 3 double bonds or equivalent), plus a double bond (another degree), and a ring or double bond (another one). Or maybe a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and another ring or a triple bond (another 1), and possibly an amine group? Wait, but the formula also includes an O. So maybe a benzene ring, an enal (double bond and aldehyde), and another ring or something else?

The NMR data is given as:
9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Let me think about each of these signals.

The 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but wait, this is a triplet. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton, like from an enol or something else. Or wait, could it be an aldehyde adjacent to another proton, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde? Because in that case, the aldehyde proton might couple with another proton, giving a triplet. But wait, in most cases, the aldehyde proton is deshielded and doesn't have neighboring protons because it's at the end. Unless the molecule has some conjugation or neighboring group that causes splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol tautomer or something else. I'll keep this in mind.

Then, there are two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51. Each is integrating for 2H. So perhaps a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho and para to the substituent would show as a doublet. But wait, if it's two doublets each for two protons, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene in the para position, but each set of protons is split into a doublet. Alternatively, perhaps two separate benzene rings each with a substituent. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe the compound has a benzene ring connected to another group, like a side chain.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzene is C6H6, so the side chain would be C2H3NO. That's a bit tricky. Let's think about possible groups. If the side chain has an aldehyde (CHO), that would account for part of it. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine group attached.

But wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 9.72. If that's an
