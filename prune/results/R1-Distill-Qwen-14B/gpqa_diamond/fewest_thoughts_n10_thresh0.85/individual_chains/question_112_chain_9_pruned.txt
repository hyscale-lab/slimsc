Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about an electron's state, denoted as |alpha>. It's given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Here, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states. So, the state vector is in the z-basis.

The task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, wait. So first, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional, not necessarily normalized. Then, I'll probably need to find the eigenstates of the operator A, because the probabilities will depend on how |alpha> projects onto those eigenstates.

Alternatively, maybe the operator is given in the computational basis, and I can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors that way. Let's see.

First, let's write down the state |alpha>. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's denote |up> as (1,0) and |down> as (0,1). So the state vector in the z-basis can be written as a column vector [1+i, 2-i]^T. But since it's proportional, we need to find the normalization factor.

The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the components. So the magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1^2 +1^2)=2, and for (2-i) it's (2^2 + (-1)^2)=4+1=5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), so |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, no. Wait: the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So when we compute the inner product, the vector is (1+i, 2-i), but to normalize, the squared magnitude is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2. Which is (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) )= 2 +5=7. So yeah, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So the state |alpha> is normalized, right? Because 1/sqrt(7) squared times the sum is 1. So yeah.

Next, the operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, 0 otherwise. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the possible states are up and down, so a 2-dimensional space. So the matrix A would look like:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Wait, because A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero. So that's the matrix.

Wait, but wait a second: the matrix is given as A_ij = hbar/2 when i != j, else zero. So for a 2x2 matrix, it's a zero diagonal and off-diagonal elements hbar/2. So the matrix is:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

So that's the operator. Now, we need to find the eigenstates of this operator because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitude of the eigenstate in the state |alpha>.

But wait, no, the operator is given, so the eigenstates
