Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs. The spectrographs are ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck Observatory. The question gives me five stars and I need to figure out which ones both instruments can detect.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star as seen from Earth is important here. The apparent magnitude determines if a telescope can see it. The lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. So, I think each star's apparent magnitude needs to be calculated because the question gives some absolute magnitudes and distances, but others have apparent magnitudes already.

Wait, the problem says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. Wait, wait, no. Let me check the question again. Oh right: "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait, the wording is a bit tricky. It says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17, since brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent magnitude less than or equal to 16.

Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. Apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star has an apparent magnitude of 16, that's fainter than a magnitude of 15. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17, that would mean any star with V magnitude <17. Because above 17 is fainter, so it's the ones below 17 that are brighter.

Wait no. Suppose a star is magnitude 17. That's just at the limit. If the instrument can observe stars brighter than 17, then anything with V <17 is acceptable. Because a magnitude of 16 is brighter than 17, so it's allowed. So for ESPRESSO, stars with V <=17 can be detected. For HIRES, stars with V <=16 can be detected.

So each star must have apparent V magnitude (taking into account extinction) less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO
