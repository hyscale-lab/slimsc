Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, are used to determine the concentration of complex ions in solution. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is. The complexes here are Co(SCN)_n^m+ where n ranges from 1 to 4, I think. Each β corresponds to the formation of the nth complex.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think dithiocyanato would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, right? So that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ ion. So we're looking for the concentration of this particular complex relative to all other cobalt species.

So I need to calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2^2+] out of the total cobalt species. The total cobalt includes the free Co^2+ ion and all the complexes from n=1 to n=4.

The approach I think I should take is to model the formation of these complexes using the stability constants. The stability constant βn is defined as [Co(SCN)_n^2+]/([Co^{2+}][SCN^-]^n). 

Wait, but how do I calculate the distribution of each species? I recall that the distribution depends on the concentrations of the ligand (SCN^-) and the stability constants. When multiple complexes are possible, each with different β's, their concentrations are determined by these constants.

I think the general approach is to assume that the sum of all the species (free Co^2+ and all the complexes) equals the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 1e-2 M. 

But with four complexes, this might get complicated. Maybe there's a way to find the fraction of each complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the dominant species are the ones with the highest β's because they form more stable complexes. Let's look at the β values: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the third β is the highest (63), followed by β2 (40), then β4 (16), and β1 (9).

Wait, but β3 is the highest, so the [Co(SCN)_3^-] complex is the most stable, but wait, no, because β3 is for [Co(SCN)_3]^+, I think. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the charge here. Let me think: each SCN^- is -1, so [Co(SCN)_
