Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics (CED). 

First, I should remember what regularization means. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are situations where calculations give infinite results, which aren't physically meaningful. By introducing a temporary 'cutoff' or some other method, regularization helps to make these infinities manageable so we can compute meaningful finite results. But wait, some theories don't need regularization because they naturally avoid these divergences. Or maybe they don't arise in the same way?

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a type of string theory that incorporates supersymmetry. I recall that string theories aim to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. They propose that particles are not point-like but rather tiny strings vibrating at different frequencies. One advantage of string theories is that they might be finite, meaning they don't have the same kinds of divergences as traditional quantum field theories. Because in superstring theory, all interactions are described by strings rather than point particles, which could mean fewer divergences. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't require regularization, or at least not in the same way. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Do string theories still have higher-order divergences that need handling?

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, where quarks behave almost as free particles at very high energies (or equivalently, at short distances). But when it comes to regularization, I think QCD does require it. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, like in the beta function calculations, you need to regularize the integrals to handle divergences. So QCD does use regularization techniques, such as dimensional regularization or lattice regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, dealing with electrons and photons. I remember that QED is a renormalizable theory, meaning that the infinities can be absorbed into a finite number of parameters (like the charge and mass). But to perform renormalization, you often need to regularize first
