Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and break it down.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I know that luminosity relates to how much light a star emits, right? So I remember the formula for the luminosity of a star is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh wait, yeah, that's the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

The problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, does mass directly affect luminosity in this context? Well, maybe through other factors like temperature, but I'm not sure. Let's see what else is given.

The stars' wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength emitted by a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ1 = λ2, then T1 = T2. Oh, that's a key point.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So T1 equals T2? Because Wien's law says so. So if T is the same, then their temperatures are equal.

So if I go back to the luminosity formula, L depends on R² and T⁴. Since T is the same, L is proportional to R squared. So L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T^4, and L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T^4. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Given R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 is 1.5. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options have a choice A as ~2.25. So why would any of the other options be correct? Hmm. Did I miss something?

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity is about the Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength would be shifted due to their velocities. Oh wait, but earlier we concluded the peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, but their rest wavelengths are different because of the Doppler effect.

Wait, let me think. If a star is moving towards us, its light gets blueshifted, moving away causes redshift. But the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same when observed. So if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, its emitted light's peak is at a different wavelength, but due to Doppler shift, it's observed at
