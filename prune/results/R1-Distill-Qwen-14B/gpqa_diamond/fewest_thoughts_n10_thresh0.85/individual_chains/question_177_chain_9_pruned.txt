Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by carefully reading the problem.

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The stars appear brightest at the same wavelengths, which probably relates to their temperatures. Then, their radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. The question is asking by what factor the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on both its radius and temperature. The formula I'm thinking of is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but the problem says they appear brightest at the same wavelengths. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max ≈ (2.9 × 10^-3 m·K) / T. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T is the same. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, but wait. The problem doesn't say they have the same temperature, but that their wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So yes, T1 = T2. Because Wien's Law directly relates peak wavelength to temperature.

So now, since both stars have the same T, the luminosity formula simplifies. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is the same, L is proportional to R².

Given that Star_1 has radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so R1 = 1.5 R2. So the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2 would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times greater. So that would suggest the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but the options have some other choices like ~2.32 or ~2.23. Did I miss something?

Wait, maybe I'm forgetting something else. Oh, the radial velocities are given: Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, while Star_1's is zero. How does that come into play?

Hmm. Radial velocity... Wait, radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps the radial velocities cause a shift in the observed wavelengths, but the actual peak emission (as per their rest frames) might be different.

Wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. So if one is moving towards us (blue shift) or away (red shift), their observed λ_max would differ from their actual λ_max. But the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same. So perhaps I need to account for the Doppler shift.

Wait, that complicates things. Because if one star is moving (say, towards us or away from us), the observed peak wavelength would be different from the rest wavelength. So if both stars have the same observed λ_max, their actual (rest frame) temperatures might not be the same.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem says that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So for Star_1, with radial velocity 0, the observed λ_max is the same as Star_2, which has a higher velocity.

So let's model this. The peak wavelength observed is λ_observed. For Star_1, since its radial velocity is zero, λ1_observed = λ1_rest. For Star_2, which is moving, let's say away from us, so its observed wavelength is longer (redshifted).

Wait, but the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But Star_2's actual λ2_rest would be different because of the Doppler shift. So I need to use the Doppler formula to find the relationship between their rest wavelengths.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) for relativistic speeds, but maybe since 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3e5 km/s), so 700 is about 0.0023c, so maybe non-relativistic approximation is okay.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about it. The Doppler shift formula for non-relativistic speeds is approximately λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive for moving away, negative towards). Wait, but I think the exact formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift, and for small z, z ≈ v_r / c.

Alternatively, for small velocities, the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c) can be used. But since 700 km/s is about 0.23% of the speed of light (since c ≈ 3e5 km/s), it's not negligible but perhaps not too bad. Alternatively, maybe we can use the exact relativistic Doppler shift formula.

But perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the observed λ_max is the same, so the Doppler shift must account for the difference in their rest frame temperatures.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me structure the problem step by step.

Given:

1. Star_1 and Star_2 have same observed λ_max (λ1_obs = λ2_obs).
2. Star_1 has radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R1 = 1.5 R2).
3. Both stars have same mass (M1 = 1.5 M2) — but wait, no, the problem says Star_1's mass is 1.5 times larger than Star_2's. So M1 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, but how does mass relate to temperature or luminosity? Oh, wait, I thought the problem said the stars are radiating as black bodies, so their luminosity is determined by L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So their mass might not directly affect their luminosity, unless we're considering other factors like in main sequence stars where mass and luminosity are related, but I think
