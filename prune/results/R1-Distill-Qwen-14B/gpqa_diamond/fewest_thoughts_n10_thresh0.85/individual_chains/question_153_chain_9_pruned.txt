Okay, so I've got this Michael addition problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C, and I need to match each with the correct product from the options. Let's start with reaction A.

Reaction A is between dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is a conjugated system. The nucleophile is usually the enolate of a carbonyl compound.

Wait, so in the Michael reaction, the enolate acts as the nucleophile. In reaction A, dimethyl malonate is the donor, and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the acceptor. So the enolate would form from the malonate. Wait, malonate is a good donor because it's a diester, right? It can form an enolate which is a strong nucleophile.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C-O-methyl, but with the p-tolyl group attached. Wait, no, wait. The structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me? Hmm, or wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the acrylate? No, wait, the substituent is on the acrylate chain. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, that doesn't make sense because acrylate is only three carbons (CH2=CH-CO-O-R). Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached on the third carbon. Wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me, but that doesn't seem right because that would be a propenoate. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, perhaps the substituent is on the alpha position.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 (CH2=CH-), then C3 is attached to the p-tolyl group and the ester group. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt. Oh wait, no, OEt is from NaOEt? Wait, but the reaction is with methyl acrylate, so it's OMe.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch this out. But perhaps it's better to move on and get back. The key is that in the Michael reaction, the enolate from the malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH. So when NaOEt (a strong base) is present, it deprotonates the alpha position, forming an enolate. The enolate would be the conjugate base, which can attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate).

So the acrylate is the acceptor. The enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate, leading to a 1,4 addition. So when the enolate attacks, the double bond shifts, and the carbonyl becomes part of the structure.

So the product would be a new compound where the malonate's CH2 is added to the acrylate. Let me think: the
