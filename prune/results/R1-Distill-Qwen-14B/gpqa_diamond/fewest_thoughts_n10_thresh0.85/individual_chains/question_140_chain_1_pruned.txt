Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a multiple-choice question with a lot of clues. Let's try to unpack it step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, which probably means it's something like argon (Ar) since Ar has 18 protons and 18 neutrons (wait, no, argon has 18 protons and 22 neutrons? Wait, maybe not.) Wait, no, let me think again. Oh, wait, if a molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, then the total would be double the number of protons. Wait, maybe I should think about the simplest cases. For example, H2O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in the molecule? No, wait, each H is 1, O is 8. So H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons) and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons in molecule: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: 8. So not same. Hmm. What about CH4? Carbon has 6 protons, each H has 1. So 6 +4=10 protons. Neutrons: carbon has 6 (since C-12), H has 0. So total neutrons 6. Not same. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like NH3? Let's see: Each N has 7 protons, H has 1. So 7 + 3*1=10 protons. Neutrons: N has 7 (if it's N-14?), H has 0. So 7. Not same. Hmm, maybe it's CO2? C has 6, O has 8 each. So 6 + 2*8=22 protons. Neutrons: C is 6, O is 8 each (if O-16). So 6 + 2*(8) =22, same as protons. Oh, wait! So CO2 has protons sum to 22 and neutrons also sum to 22. So gas W could be CO2. So that would fit.

But wait, gas W is the product of the reaction between X and Y. Also, precipitate G forms when X and Y react. Then, heating G gives B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Let me recall: 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What has a melting point around there? I think maybe something like ammonium chloride? No, wait, or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's water? But water freezes at 273 K (0 degrees C), which is very close to 277 K. So maybe B is water? Or maybe it's ice, but ice is solid at 0 C. Wait, but melting point is when it goes from solid to liquid. So if B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4°C, perhaps it's a different substance. Wait, maybe something like sodium chloride? No, that's 801°C. Hmm, perhaps B is something else. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe B is sodium nitrate? No, that melts at a higher temperature. Wait, maybe it's a different compound. Let's think: B is a product when G is heated. So G is a precipitate, which upon heating gives B. If B's melting point is about 4°C, perhaps it's a hydrate or something that loses water upon heating.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y violently, producing W, G, and B upon heating. What if Y is water? Because then, X reacting with water could produce gas and a precipitate. Let's say X is a metal, like sodium. Sodium reacts with water to produce H2 gas, but wait, wait—hydrogen has one proton and one neutron? No, H2 has two atoms, each with one proton and one neutron (if it's H2 from H2O, which would be H2 gas). Wait, no. Wait, the gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. So if gas W is H2, that has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So that's not equal. So that can
