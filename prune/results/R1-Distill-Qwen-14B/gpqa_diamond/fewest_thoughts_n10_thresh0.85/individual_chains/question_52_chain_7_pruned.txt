Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The question is about a star and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right, I remember that stars have something called effective temperature, and when spots are present, they can change the overall temperature. Oh wait, the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500K. 

So the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower than when there are no spots. So the factor is (no spots ratio)/(spots ratio) = some number greater than 1. 

The transition between these levels is at 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. And the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. That means I can use the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where:
- n2 is the number of atoms in level 2,
- n1 is the number in level 1,
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights,
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

So the ratio R is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1)*exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference (E2 - E1).

But wait, the energy difference can also be calculated using the wavelength of the transition. The energy difference ΔE is related to the photon's energy via E = hc/
