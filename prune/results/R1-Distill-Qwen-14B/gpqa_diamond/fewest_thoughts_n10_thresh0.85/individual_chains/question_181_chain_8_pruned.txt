Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux question. Hmm, let's break it down. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops, and we need to find the ratio of two neutrino flux bands.

Wait, first, I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy through nuclear fusion. The pp-III branch is one of the steps, I think. So if that stops, what happens?

I recall that the pp chain produces neutrinos. Specifically, the dominant neutrinos come from the decay of beryllium-7 to lithium-7, which happens in the pp-III reaction. So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those neutrinos would stop. But the question says it stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos take about that time to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, that means we would stop detecting neutrinos from that process now.

So, the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in a certain energy range. I think the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in the lower energy range. Wait, what's the typical energy of solar neutrinos? I remember that the majority are around a few hundred keV. The pp-III neutrinos are probably in the 700-800 keV range, which is band 1. Or wait, am I mixing that up?

Wait, no. Let me think. The main neutrinos from the Sun are from the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. But the CNO neutrinos are higher energy, like a few MeV or more. The pp-chain neutrinos are lower. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos in a specific energy band. So if the pp-III stops, the neutrino flux in its energy range would drop.

So, the question is about the flux in two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). If the pp-III branch stops, the neutrinos from that reaction would stop, which are probably in band 1. So the flux in band 1 would decrease. But what about band 2?

Wait, are there other sources of neutrinos in those bands? For example, the CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stopped, but CNO continues, the neutrinos in higher bands would still come from CNO. But the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So CNO is still active.

Wait, but the pp-III neutrinos are part of the main pp chain, so if that stops, then the main source of lower energy neutrinos would be gone. So the 700-800 keV band (band 1) would lose a lot of its flux, while the 800-900 keV (band 2) would remain as it was.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact energy ranges. Let me try to remember. The pp-III neutrinos are from the decay of 7Be, which has a peak around ~680 keV. So that would fall into band 1 (700-800 keV). So if pp-III stops, the flux in band 1 would drop to almost zero, while band 2 (800-900) would still have neutrinos from other sources, like maybe the CNO cycle or the pp-I or pp-II branches?

Hmm, wait, but the pp chain has several branches. The main branch, pp-I, produces lower energy neutrinos. The pp-II branch produces higher energy, maybe around 1-2 MeV? I'm not certain. Wait, I think the pp-I branch produces neutrinos around a few tens of keV, but that's maybe not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the dominant neutrinos from the pp chain are from the pp-III branch, which is around 700 keV. 

So if pp-III stops, the main source of neutrinos in 700-800 keV would stop, making the flux in band 1 drop. But what about
