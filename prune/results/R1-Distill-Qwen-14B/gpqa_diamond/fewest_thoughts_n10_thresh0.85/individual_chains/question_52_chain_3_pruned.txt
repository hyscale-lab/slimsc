Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about stars with and without spots, and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels.

Alright, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Hmm, wait, but dark spots on a star are cooler regions, right? So when spots cover part of the surface, the observed effective temperature would decrease because those spots emit less light. But in this case, the overall Teff is given as 5500 K when 40% is spotted. So the star's overall brightness is lower because of the spots.

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. Without spots, the ratio is higher or lower than when there are spots? The problem says that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when there are no spots, the ratio is higher. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So the factor is ratio_without_spots / ratio_with_spots.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet, I think. Let me recall: 1000 Å is ultraviolet, so 1448 is in the UV. So these are probably ionization lines or something related.

But the problem is about neutral Ti, so Ti I. So the transition is between two energy levels in neutral titanium.

The ratio n1/n2 depends on the temperature because of the exponential term. So when the star's Teff drops, the temperature in the photosphere that affects this transition would be lower. How does that affect the ratio?

Wait, but wait. The effective temperature of the star is the overall temperature, but when spots are present, the photosphere's temperature distribution changes. But the problem states that we're to examine the photosphere when the star has spots. So the photospheric temperature is now lower overall, but wait, wait. Wait, when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. But what about the temperature in the photosphere of the spotted regions versus the unspotted regions?

Wait, no. The question says: "when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the
