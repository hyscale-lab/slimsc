Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Okay, let's see what the question is about.

The question presents two reactions and asks us to select the correct reagents (A and B) from the given options. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, which produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out what reagents A and B are. Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, what is that product? Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is a ketone, (CH3)2CO. NaCN is sodium cyanide. When a ketone reacts with CN- (cyanide ion), under certain conditions, it typically undergoes a nucleophilic addition. So, the CN- would add to the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. The formula for that would be NC-C(OH)(CH2CH3)CH3? Or perhaps I should write it as (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. So, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the structure: NC-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, but that may not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2-C(OH)-CH2-CN? No, wait, perhaps it's (CH
