Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting its product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. 

First, let me look at the IR data. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But looking at the options, all the products seem to involve either carboxylic acids or substituted benzene rings. A carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1, which fits with the first peak. There's also a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch—so that suggests maybe a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm-1. Hmm. On the other hand, if it's an ester or ketone, it might be higher. Wait, another peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking at the NMR data: The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let me list them:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typical for an O-H proton, like in a carboxylic acid. So that's probably a -COOH group. But wait, another possibility is an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But if it's a carboxylic acid, that would make sense. 

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe para-substituted aromatic protons. 

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also aromatic, another doublet. So perhaps the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions. Like, maybe two substituents
