Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a muon, which is like a heavier version of an electron, but I don't think the type of particle matters here—it's just about the operator. The operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, wait, the direction is arbitrary but in x-z, so the angle theta is measured from the z-axis, I guess. Phi would be the angle around the y-axis, but since it's in x-z, phi might be 0 or 90 or something? Not sure, maybe it's 0 because it's in x-z.

The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. So, the operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z, each given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the eigenvector for the operator P in the direction n, corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but how does the arbitrary direction n factor into this? Oh right, because the operator P here is the component of angular momentum along n. So the operator would be P = (P_x, P_y, P_z) · n hat, which is the unit vector in direction n. But wait, no, the operator is the component along n, so the operator is actually (n · vector P), which would be P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But wait, the direction n lies in the x-z plane. So the angle theta is between n and the z-axis. Since it's in x-z, the y-component of n is zero. So n hat is (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta))? Wait, no, because in spherical coordinates, the direction is (sin(theta) cos(phi), sin(theta) sin(phi), cos(theta)). But since it's in x-z, phi is 0, so yes, n would be (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)).

But wait, the problem says the direction is arbitrary in x-z. So the angle theta is the angle from the z-axis. So n is (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)). So the operator P along n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But wait, the operator P is given for each component. Let me write down each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P_n would be n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since n_y is zero. So, because n is (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)), n_x is sin(theta), n_z is cos(theta).

So, P_n = (sin(theta) * ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cos(theta) * ħ/2)* [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that. Let's factor out ħ/2.

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sin(theta) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos(theta) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So the matrix inside becomes:
[ [cos(theta), sin(theta)],
  [sin(theta), -cos(theta)] ]

Wait, let me compute each element:

First, the (1,1) element: cos(theta)*1 + sin(theta)*0 = cos(theta)
(1,2) element: cos(theta)*0 + sin(theta)*1 = sin(theta)
(2,1): same as (1,2) because the matrix is symmetric? Wait, no. Because when you add the two matrices:

For P_x, it's [[0,1],[1,0]], and P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when you multiply each by coefficients and add, the (2,2) element is -cos(theta).

So the matrix is [[cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, no. Let me compute each term:

n_x P_x = sin(theta) * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
n_z P_z = cos(theta) * (ħ/2)* [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So when you add them, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)] ]

So the matrix for P_n is that.

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector of P_n with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So:

P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So, the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can factor out ħ/2 on both sides, so it cancels out, leaving:

[ [cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

cos(theta) a + sin(theta) b = a
sin(theta) a - cos(theta) b = b

Wait, let me write the equations more clearly.

Equation 1: cos(theta) a + sin(theta) b = a
Equation 2: sin(theta) a - cos(theta) b = b

Let me rearrange equation 1:

cos(theta) a + sin(theta) b - a = 0

a (cos(theta) - 1) + sin(theta) b = 0

Similarly, equation 2:

sin(theta) a - cos(theta) b - b = 0

sin(theta) a - b (cos(theta) + 1) = 0

So, we have two equations:

1) a (cos(theta) - 1) + b sin(theta) = 0
2) a sin(theta) - b (cos(theta) + 1 ) = 0

Let me write these as a system:

[ (cos(theta) - 1)    sin(theta)     ] [a]   [0]
[ sin(theta)          -(cos(theta)+1) ] [b] = [0]

To have non-trivial solutions (eigenvectors), the determinant must be zero.

Compute the determinant:

D = (cos(theta) -1)(- (cos(theta) + 1) ) - [sin(theta)]^2

= - (cos^2(theta) - 1) ) - sin^2(theta)

Wait, (cos(theta) -1)(-cos(theta)-1) = -(cos(theta)-1)(cos(theta)+1) = - [cos^2(theta) -1] = -( - sin^2(theta) ) = sin^2(theta)

Then, subtracting [sin(theta)]^2: D = sin^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = 0. So yes, determinant is zero, so non-trivial solutions exist.

Now, solving the system. Let's take equation 1:

a (cos(theta) -1) + b sin(theta) = 0

Let me solve for a in terms of b.

a (cos(theta) -1) = - b sin(theta)

a = [ - b sin(theta) ] / (cos(theta) -1 )

Let me factor out a negative sign denominator:

cos(theta) - 1 = -(1 - cos(theta)).

So a = [ - b sin(theta) ] / ( - (1 - cos(theta)) ) )

The negatives cancel: a = [ b sin(theta) ] / (1 - cos(theta) )

Recall that 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2), and sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So substitute:

a = [ b * 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] / [2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ]

Simplify:

a = [ b cos(theta/2) ] / sin(theta/2 )

= b [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ]

= b cot(theta/2 )

So a = b cot(theta/2 )

So the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2 )

Let me write the eigenvector as [a; b] = b [cot(theta/2 ), 1 ]

But since eigenvectors are up to a scalar multiple, we can set b=1, then a = cot(theta/2 )

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2 ), 1 ]

But wait, to make it normalized, we need to compute the normalization condition.

The eigenvector is [a, b], so the inner product a a* + b b* =1.

Assume a and b are real for simplicity? Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors can have complex entries, but in this case, our operator is Hermitian, so eigenvectors should be real? Because the components P_x, P_y, P_z are Hermitian. Because the operator P is a component of angular momentum, which should be Hermitian.

Wait, the operator P would be Hermitian if the components are, because n · (P_x, P_y, P_z) is Hermitian since each component is Hermitian and n has real components.

So yes, the operator P_n is Hermitian, so its eigenvectors should be real. So a and b are real numbers.

So, the eigenvector is [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2 ), 1 ] multiplied by some normalization factor.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute a and b.

So a = cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2 )

So the vector is [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2 ), 1 ]

To normalize, compute the inner product:

a^2 + b^2 = [ (cos^2(theta/2) )/( sin^2(theta/2) ) ] + 1 = [ cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ) ] / sin^2(theta/2 )

Which is [1]/ sin^2(theta/2 )

So normalization factor is sqrt( sin^2(theta/2 ) ) = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (cos(theta/2 )/ sin(theta/2 )) * sin(theta/2 ), 1 * sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, no. Wait, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(a² +b²) = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized vector is [ a * sin(theta/2 ), b * sin(theta/2 ) ]

Which would be [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, let's compute:

After normalization, each component is multiplied by sin(theta/2 ), right? Because the norm of [a, b] is 1/(sin(theta/2 )).

So the normalized vector is [ (cot(theta/2 )) * sin(theta/2 ), 1 * sin(theta/2 ) ]

Simplify:

Cot(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 ) / sin(theta/2 )

So the first component is [ cos(theta/2 ) / sin(theta/2 ) ] * sin(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

The second component is sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, but wait. Are these the components? Let me think. I think I might have made a mistake here. Because in the original setup, the operator is along n, so the eigenvectors depend on the direction. But looking at the options, option C is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

But wait, wait, let me think about the physical meaning. The eigenstates of the spin operator along a direction n are the spin-up and spin-down states in that direction. For spin-1/2 particles, the spin-up state along n would have components based on the direction.

In the standard case, when n is along z, the eigenvector is [1; 0], which corresponds to cos(theta/2) when theta is 0 (since cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0). Similarly, if n is along x, theta is 90 degrees, so theta/2 is 45 degrees. Then the eigenvector is [cos(45), sin(45)] = [1/√2, 1/√2], which matches the standard eigenstate.

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Wait, but option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2/2)). Wait, no, looking at option D: it's sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2). Hmm, so that would be a vector with components scaled by sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar, but wait, in our calculation, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), without any hbar factor. So perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, no, looking at the options again:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar )

That seems to have hbar factors, which I don't see in our result.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

Ah, that's in spherical coordinates, but in our case, phi is 0 because the direction is in x-z.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Which is exactly what we got.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) )

So option D has the components scaled by sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), multiplied by hbar.

Wait, but in our problem, the eigenvector components are just real numbers, not involving hbar. So why would the options have hbar? That seems off. Because the eigenvectors are dimensionless. Hbar is a constant with units of action, so including hbar in the components would give them units, which they shouldn't have because they're vectors in Hilbert space, which is dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps the options have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The question says the operator P has components given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So P_x is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], etc.

But when we found the eigenvector, the components are just the coefficients, without any hbar. So I think the answer is option C.

But wait, let me look at the question again. The question says 'what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?' So eigenvectors are typically written as vectors in the Hilbert space, so they should be dimensionless, so hbar shouldn't be part of the components.

So the correct answer should be option C. The other options either have hbar in the components, which doesn't make sense, or the wrong trigonometric functions.

Wait, but looking at the problem again, the operator P is given as components multiplied by ħ/2, but when we calculated the eigenvector, we found [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is correct regardless of the units of P. So the eigenvector's components don't carry ħ; it's the eigenvalue that does. So the eigenvector is indeed option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each given as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the matrix representation becomes:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \, |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle
\]
Substituting the matrix representation of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, we solve:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
This leads to the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \quad \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b
\]
Rearranging, we find:
\[
a (\cos\theta - 1) + \sin\theta \, b = 0, \quad \sin\theta \, a - b (\cos\theta + 1) = 0
\]
Solving for $a$ and $b$, we find the ratio $a/b = \cot(\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
To normalize, we compute:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = \cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = \frac{\cos^2(\theta/2)}{\sin^2(\theta/2)} + 1 = \frac{1}{\sin^2(\theta/2)}
\]
The normalization factor is $\sin(\theta/2)$, so the normalized eigenvector becomes:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.
  
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$  
  This represents spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the normalized eigenvector derived above.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This includes incorrect scaling factors and $\hbar$ in the components.

### Final Answer
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
