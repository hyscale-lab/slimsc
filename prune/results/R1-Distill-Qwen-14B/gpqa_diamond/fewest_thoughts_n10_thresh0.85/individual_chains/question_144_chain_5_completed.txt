Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark, and resonances are particles that don't exist long enough to be observed directly; they decay quickly. So the decay distance must depend on how long the particle lives before decaying.

The given parameters are E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I think the decay width is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle connects the two. The uncertainty in energy (which is Γ) and the uncertainty in time (which is the lifetime τ) are inversely related. So Γ ≈ ħ / τ, or τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but decay distance isn't just about lifetime. The mean decay distance, or the proper decay length, is the product of the velocity (v) and the lifetime (τ). So L = v * τ.

Wait, no, wait. The mean decay length is gamma multiplied by v * tau, right? Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So L = gamma * v * c * tau.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps in this case, since the particle is produced at high energy, it's moving relativistically, so we need to calculate gamma (the Lorentz factor) based on E_X and m_X.

So first, I need to find the velocity of the meson. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So E = gamma * m c^2. Since c is a big number, but in units where c=1, E in GeV, mass in GeV/c², etc., but I think I can work in natural units for simplicity, then convert to meters at the end.

Wait, natural units have c=1 and ħ=1. So let's see.

So gamma is E / (m c²), but since in natural units, E (in GeV) is equal to gamma * m (in GeV/c²) * c², but perhaps that's getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.

In natural units, E = gamma * m, because E = gamma m c^2 and we set c=1. So gamma is E / m.

So here, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found from gamma. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²), solving for v gives v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2). Let me compute that.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So 1/gamma squared is (1/6.6667)^2 ≈ (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. Then 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is about 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c. That's close to the speed of light.

Next, find the lifetime tau. Tau is the proper lifetime, which is related to the decay width via tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, units. Since Gamma is given in MeV, but in natural units, the units for ħ is GeV s. Wait, let me think.

Wait, in natural units, ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm. But perhaps I should compute everything in SI units or something else. Alternatively, maybe I can use the relation in natural units where ħ c is a known constant.

Wait, the decay width Γ is 320 MeV. So in natural units (GeV), that's 0.32 GeV.

So, tau = ħ / Γ. Since ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

Calculating 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 * 20 is 6.4, so 6.582 is about 20.56875 times 0.32? Wait, let me compute it accurately.

6.582 ÷ 0.32: Let me see, 0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 20.56875 would be 20 + (0.582 / 0.32) → 0.582 ÷ 0.32 is approximately 1.81875. So 20 + 1.81875 = 21.81875. So 21.81875e-25 s.

But wait, 6.582 / 0.32 is better done as 6582 / 320 → 6582 ÷ 320. 320*20=6400, 6582-6400=182. 182/320 ≈ 0.56875. So total 20.56875. So tau ≈ (6.582e-25 GeV s) / 0.32 GeV = (20.56875) * 1e-25 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 s. Wait, wait, that can't be right because 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875.

So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Hmm, but that seems very small. But given that mesons are short-lived, maybe that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of proper lifetime. So the lifetime in the rest frame is tau = ħ / Γ. Then, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

So the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So the mean decay length is gamma * v * c * tau.

Wait, but let me think again. The mean decay length L is v * gamma * tau * c, because the lifetime experienced is gamma tau, and the speed is v, so distance is v multiplied by (gamma tau). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write L = gamma * v * tau * c. Wait, no, because tau is the proper lifetime, so the lab lifetime is gamma tau, and L = v * gamma tau * c? Wait, units can get tricky.

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

In natural units, c=1, so distance is in units of GeV^-1. But we need to convert to meters. So perhaps it's better to compute everything in natural units first, then convert to meters.

So, alternative approach:

1. Compute the velocity, beta (v/c) = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2). Gamma is E/m = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So, 1/gamma^2 is (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta ≈ 0.9887.

2. Compute the proper lifetime tau = ħ / (Gamma X). Wait, Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

3. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So gamma is 6.6667, so gamma tau ≈ 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.37123e-23 seconds.

4. The velocity is beta c, so the decay length is velocity multiplied by lifetime in lab frame. So L = beta c * gamma tau.

Wait, but beta is v/c, so beta c is v. So L = v * gamma tau.

But wait, no, because tau is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, so the distance is v * gamma tau.

Wait, v is beta c, so L = beta c * gamma tau.

Let me compute that.

So beta is approximately 0.9887, gamma is 6.6667, tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

But let's compute each step numerically.

First, compute gamma*tau:

gamma*tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.37123e-23 s.

Multiply by beta: 0.9887 * 1.37123e-23 s ≈ 1.355e-23 s.

Multiply by c. The speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So L = 1.355e-23 s * 3e8 m/s = 4.065e-15 meters.

Wait, that seems to be one of the options. Let me check the options.

Looking back, the options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

So my calculation leads to approximately 4.065e-15 m, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for possible errors.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma and beta.

Gamma is E/m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So correct.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(6.6666667)^2)).

Compute 6.6666667^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444.

So 1/44.4444 ≈0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Sqrt of that is approximately 0.9887. Correct.

Tau = ħ / Γ. ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau =6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Then gamma * tau = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute that:

6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = (6 + 0.6666667) * 2.056875e-24 = 6 * 2.056875e-24 + 0.6666667 * 2.056875e-24.

6 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.234125e-23

0.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ (2/3) * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.37125e-24.

Adding together: 1.234125e-23 + 1.37125e-24 = 1.234125e-23 + 0.137125e-23 = 1.37125e-23 s.

Then multiply by beta (0.9887):

1.37125e-23 s * 0.9887 ≈ 1.355e-23 s.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s):

1.355e-23 s * 3e8 m/s = (1.355 *3) * 1e-15 m = 4.065e-15 m.

Hmm, that's precisely option B. So the answer would be B.

I think that makes sense. All the steps seem to check out. So the correct option is B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and decay width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime, which is related to the decay width via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and the relativistic velocity of the particle.

### Step 1: Compute the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Compute the velocity (\( \beta \))
The velocity \( \beta \) (in units of \( c \)) is:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Compute the proper lifetime (\( \tau \))
The proper lifetime is related to the decay width by:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}
\]
Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( \Gamma_X = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Compute the lab-frame lifetime (\( \gamma \tau \))
The lifetime in the lab frame is:
\[
\gamma \tau = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37123 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 5: Compute the mean decay distance (\( L \))
The mean decay distance is:
\[
L = \beta \cdot c \cdot \gamma \tau
\]
Using \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \gamma \tau \approx 1.37123 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.37123 \times 10^{-23} \approx 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
