Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, right. So first, I should probably normalize this state because the coefficients are complex. Wait, but they mentioned it's proportional, so maybe I need to find the normalization factor.

So, the state is |alpha> = a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2-i)|down>, where 'a' is the normalization constant. Or wait, no, the problem says |alpha> is proportional, so maybe it's already in that form, and I just need to find the correct 'a' such that the state is normalized. Oh wait, no, maybe the given state is already proportional, and I just need to compute the probabilities, but I think I'll have to normalize it first.

Wait, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), so the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To find the normalization, I need the inner product of alpha with itself.

The inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i), because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. Wait, no, wait. The inner product is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

So |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because the magnitude squared of a complex number a+bi is a² + b².

Similarly, |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because |alpha> must be normalized. So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the first part of the problem is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator whose matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, let me think about this operator.

Wait, the operator is a 2x2 matrix. Since it's for a spin-1/2 system (since the states are |up> and |down> for spin z-projection), the operator is 2x2. So the matrix elements are:

A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 when i=j. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

Wait, no. Wait, the matrix indices are row i, column j. So for i=1, j=2, A_12= ħ/2, and A_21= ħ/2. So the matrix is:

[
[0, ħ/2],
[ħ/2, 0]
]

Wait, no, because when i != j, A_ij = ħ/2. So yes, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2.

Wait, but what operator has this form? Oh, wait, the operator sigma_x multiplied by ħ/2. Because sigma_x is:

[
[0,1],
[1,0]
]

So if we multiply sigma_x by ħ/2, we get exactly the matrix given. So this operator is (ħ/2) * sigma_x, which is the Pauli matrix in the x-direction scaled by ħ/2.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of sigma_x. Because when you multiply an operator by a scalar, the eigenstates don't change; the eigenvalues just scale.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which can be written as superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, the eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because sigma_x is (|up><down| + |down><up| ), so its eigenstates are the ones where spin is in the x-direction.

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), and their eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and −ħ/2, respectively.

Wait, because sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So the problem is asking for the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates of the operator A.

So, the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, but we need to find the probability of it being in |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, we can write |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and the square of the coefficients will give the probabilities.

Wait, but maybe I should compute the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the probabilities by expressing |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

So, let's compute the components of |alpha> in the basis of |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Let me express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

We know that:

|up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, because when you add |+x> and |-x>, you get |up>, and when you subtract, you get |down>.

So, substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) * (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) + (2 - i) * (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Simplify this expression.

Let me distribute the terms:

= [ [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] |+x> / sqrt(2) + [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] |−x> / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Compute the coefficients:

Coefficient for |+x>:

(1+i) + (2 - i) = 1 + 2 + i - i = 3

Coefficient for |-x>:

(1+i) - (2 - i) = 1 - 2 + i + i = (-1) + 2i

So putting it all together:

|alpha> = [ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |−x> ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

So, the amplitude for |+x> is 3 / (sqrt(14)), and for |-x> is (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

The probabilities are the square of the magnitudes of these amplitudes.

Compute |3|^2 / 14 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857... So that's about 0.6429.

Compute |(-1 + 2i)|^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but wait a second. The probabilities should add to 1. 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.643 and 5/14 ≈0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is close. Option D says 0.61 and 0.29, which seems off. Option C is 0.28 and 0.72, which doesn't fit. Option B is 0.54 and 0.46, which doesn't match 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64. So that looks like option A's choices. But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me re-express |alpha> in the x-basis.

Wait, another approach: since the operator A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>. The probabilities are the square of the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

So, the probability of measuring +ħ/2 is |< +x | alpha > |^2, and similarly for the other.

So, let me compute < +x | alpha >.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, < +x | alpha > = [ (1 + 0) <up| + (0 +1) <down| ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Wait, no, wait. The inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So, inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ] / sqrt(7)

But <up|down> = 0, and <up|up> = <down|down> =1.

So, this simplifies to (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)

Which becomes (1/sqrt(2)) [ 3 ] / sqrt(7) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

So, the modulus squared is (3^2)/(14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Similarly, compute < -x | alpha >.

| -x > is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> - (1+i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Again, cross terms are zero.

So, this simplifies to (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 -2) + (i +i) ] / sqrt(7)

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(7) = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14))

The modulus squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is close. So that's the probabilities.

Now, the second part is to find the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, the average is (ħ/2) <sigma_x>.

And <sigma_x> is the expectation value of sigma_x in the state |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> can be expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the expectation value is ( |a|^2 (1/2) + |b|^2 (-1/2) ), but wait, wait.

Wait, no. The eigenvalues for A are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So, the expectation value would be (prob of +x) * (ħ/2) + (prob of -x) * (-ħ/2).

Which is (9/14)*(ħ/2) + (5/14)*(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5) * ħ/2 ] /14 = (4 ħ/2 )/14 = (2 ħ) /14 = ħ/7.

So the average is ħ/7.

So now, looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7. Option A's first two probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which are approximately 9/14 (~0.6429) and 5/14 (~0.3571), but 5/14 is about 0.357, which is closer to 0.36 than to 0.35. So option A matches the probabilities and the average.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

That's exactly what we've calculated. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me check if any other option has the same average. Option D's average is 2hbar/sqrt(7), which is about 2.15 times larger than ħ/7 (~0.1428 ħ). So that's different.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by computing the squared magnitude of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
\]

Thus, the total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), and the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \). The normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Next, the operator \( A \) is given as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) for \( i = j \). This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \), with eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle \), \( |-x\rangle \) basis. Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle = \frac{|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we get:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)\frac{|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} + (2-i)\frac{|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Simplifying the coefficients:

\[
\text{Coefficient of } |+x\rangle: \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad \text{Coefficient of } |-x\rangle: \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429, \quad P(-x) = \left|\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

The average value of the operator \( A \) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), the expectation value is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{(9 - 5)\hbar}{28} = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the options, the probabilities \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \) (approximations of \( 9/14 \) and \( 5/14 \)) and the average value \( \hbar/7 \) match option **A**.

**Answer: A**
