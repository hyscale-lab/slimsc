Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, with the proton-proton (pp) chain being the main one. The pp-III branch is one of the branches in this chain. From what I recall, the pp-III process involves the fusion of a helium-3 ion with two protons to form helium-4 and two protons, releasing a lot of energy, including neutrinos.

Neutrinos are produced in several steps of the pp chain. The main neutrino-producing steps are the beta decays in these processes. For the pp-III branch, each cycle produces two neutrinos, right? So, if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, the production of those neutrinos would stop too.

The question is about the flux of neutrinos in two different energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out how the flux in these bands is affected when the pp-III branch stops.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos. I think the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have higher energies compared to other branches. So, if the pp-III stops, the flux in higher energy bands would drop more than the lower ones. But wait, wait, which band is which?

Band 1 is 700-800 keV, band 2 is 800-900 keV. So band 2 is higher energy. If the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in these higher energy ranges, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2 more than in band 1.

But wait, the initial state is that the pp-III is active, and we're looking at the change after it stops. So, after stopping, the pp-III's contribution to the neutrino flux is gone.

What if the neutrino flux in band 2 is mostly from pp-III? Then the flux in band 2 would drop a lot, while band 1, which might have contributions from other processes like the pp-I or pp-II branches, would be less affected.

So the ratio Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) would depend on the relative contributions of the pp-III
