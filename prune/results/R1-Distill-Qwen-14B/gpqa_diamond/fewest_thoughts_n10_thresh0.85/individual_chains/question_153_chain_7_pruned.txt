Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember the Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The question has three parts, A, B, and C. I need to figure out each reaction's products and match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and the reagent is NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a saponified ester. It has two ester groups, so it can act as a dienolate, I think. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated esterâ€”the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C-O-Me but with a p-tolyl group on the 3rd carbon. Wait, the structure is actually CH2CH2 with a substituent? No, wait, 3-p-tolylacrylate would be CH2-CH-(p-tolyl) attached to the ester.

In the Michael reaction, the nucleophile (like the enolate) attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So dimethyl malonate, when deprotonated, would form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. Let me think about the structure. The acrylate has the structure: CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3. Wait, no, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. Wait, no, the correct structure for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CHCH(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the structure is actually the p-tolyl group is on the alpha position. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)O-Me. No, wait, the position is 3, so the substituent is on
