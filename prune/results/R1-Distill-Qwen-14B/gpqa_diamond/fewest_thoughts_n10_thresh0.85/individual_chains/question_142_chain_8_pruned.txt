Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think through this.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think each term here is a projector. So |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix that projects onto the state |0⟩, and similarly for |1⟩⟨1|. Let me write these out to see what ρ looks like.

The |0⟩ state is [1; 0], so |0⟩⟨0| would be a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere:
[1 0;
0 0]

Similarly, |1⟩ is [0; 1], so |1⟩⟨1| is:
[0 0;
0 1]

Adding these two matrices gives:
[1 0;
0 1]

Which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplying by 1/2, ρ becomes (1/2) * I. So ρ is:
[1/2 0;
0 1/2]

I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector r is a point in 3D space where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The general form of a density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, let me write that down. The density matrix can be written as ρ = (I + xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z)/2. So if I compare this to the given ρ, which is (I)/2, then the coefficients of σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z must all be zero.

So x=0, y=0, z=0. That means the Bloch vector r is [0, 0, 0]. So geometrically, this is the origin in the Bloch sphere. Which option is that?

Looking at the options:

A) (1,1,0) → That's in the x-y plane, but not zero.

B) (0,0,1) → Along the z-axis. If the state were |0⟩ or |1⟩, the Bloch vector would be along z, but here it's a completely mixed state.

Wait, wait. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. For a completely mixed state, like (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, the Bloch
