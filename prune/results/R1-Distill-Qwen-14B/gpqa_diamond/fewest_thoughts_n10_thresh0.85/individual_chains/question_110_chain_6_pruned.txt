Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, a star must have a V magnitude less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. But actually, since the question is about which stars can be detected with both, the star's apparent V magnitude has to be within both limits. Wait, no. Wait, the question is which can be detected by both. So the star must be observable by both, meaning its V magnitude must be ≤17 (ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (HIRES). So the stricter limit is 16, because if a star's V is 16.5, it can't be seen by HIRES, which needs V≤16. So the star's apparent magnitude can't be higher than 16 for both to detect it.

Wait wait, the question says, for ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, does "brighter than" mean lower magnitude numbers? Because in astronomy, lower magnitude means brighter. So "brighter than 17" would mean magnitude less than 17. So the limit is m_V ≤17 for ESPRESSO, and m_V ≤16 for HIRES.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16.

Wait, but wait, let me look at the stars. Each star's data is given either as absolute magnitude or apparent magnitude, and some have distance and E(B-V).

Let me go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V=15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent magnitude m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. So d=10, log(10)=1, so 5*1=5. So m=15.5 +5 -5 =15.5. So its apparent magnitude
