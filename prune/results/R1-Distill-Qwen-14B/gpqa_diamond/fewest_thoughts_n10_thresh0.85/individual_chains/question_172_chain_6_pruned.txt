Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the more excited the atoms are, right?

So the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, that's a specific value. I think this relates to the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The equation is something like the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution formula is (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), assuming E_i > E_j. So here, n_i is the number of excited atoms in the higher energy level, and n_j is the lower one.

In this problem, the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, n_i is twice n_j for that level. Wait, no, I think the ratio is n1 (excited) over n2 (ground state), or maybe the ratio of the populations of the two states. Wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so maybe the ratio of the excited state to ground state is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2, or maybe star_1's ratio is twice star_2's ratio. Hmm, let me read the problem again.

Wait it says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So the excitation level (n) is twice as much in star_1. So, assuming that the two stars are in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), their excitation levels follow the Boltzmann factor.

So, for each star, the excitation ratio (n_upper/n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me denote the ratio for
