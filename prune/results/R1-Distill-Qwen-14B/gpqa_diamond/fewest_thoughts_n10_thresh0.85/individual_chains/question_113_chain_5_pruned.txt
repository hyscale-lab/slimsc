Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared, and three characterization techniques were used: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to determine the chemical formula from the given data among the four options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, let's break down the information provided by each technique.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but if it's very broad, maybe it's a strong O-H, like in a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols have a broad peak too, but maybe more of a medium width? Or perhaps it's an -OH group in a different environment.

Then, the FTIR also has two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But wait, 1650 is a bit lower. That might be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds or maybe an amide. But considering the options, maybe it's an ester or another carbonyl-containing group. Wait, could it be a conjugated carbonyl like in a ketone or an ester? Or maybe a carbonyl and an aromatic ring? Wait, but 1650 is sometimes seen for conjugated double bonds, like in an aromatic ring (like C=C in benzene) or maybe an amide, but amides have N-H stretches too, which we might see in the IR.

Wait, but in the FTIR, besides the broad peak, the other two are strong. So maybe a carbonyl (1700) and another functional group. Let's think: 1700 could be ester, ketone, or maybe an acid. 1650: I'm a bit stuck. Maybe it's an aromatic ring? But I'm not sure.

Next, the 1H NMR shows several peaks, including some vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound might have a double bond, such as a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), or maybe an aromatic ring, but in that case, the protons would be more deshielded. But the question specifies "vinyl-hydrogens," which suggests an isolated double bond, not aromatic, since aromatic protons are usually more downfield.

Vinyl protons typically show up around 4.5-6.5 ppm, depending on substitution and neighboring groups. So, the presence of vinyl protons suggests that the compound has a double bond, maybe an alkene.

Now, looking at the mass spectrum: a fragment peak at m/z=45. I remember that certain characteristic fragments can help identify functional groups. For example, the molecular ion might break into a fragment. 45 is a common mass for a fragment like (CH3)2O, but wait, (CH3)2O is 45? Let's calculate: CH3-O-CH3 is (12*2)+(1*6)+(16) = 24 +6 +16=46. Hmm, no, that's 46. Wait, wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, the m/z=45 could correspond to CH3COOH. Wait, CH3COOH is 60 (12*2 + 1*4 + 16*2= 24+4+32=60). No, that's not it. Alternatively, maybe a fragment from the molecule breaking off a certain part.

Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of a ketene (like CH2=C=O, but that's 44. Oh, wait, maybe it's (CH3)2COH? No, perhaps it's a different approach. Maybe the fragment is a common group. For example, if the molecule has an ester group, an ethyl group, or perhaps a methyl group attached to something else.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2CH2O group, but that's 44. Hmm. Another possibility: the m/z=45 could be the result of the loss of a larger fragment. Wait, if the molecular formula is something like C6H10O2, then the molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72 +10 +32=114. If a fragment is 45, that would imply that the rest is 69. But I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.

Let me summarize the clues:

- FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 (likely O-H), and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 (maybe C=O and another group, like an aromatic ring or conjugated double bond).
- 1H NMR: Has vinyl protons, so double bond in the structure.
- Mass Spec: Fragment at m/z=45.

Now, let's consider possible functional groups based on the IR. The broad peak at 3000 suggests a hydroxyl group. The 1700 peak is probably a carbonyl. The 1650 could be conjugated double bonds, perhaps an aromatic ring, but the presence of vinyl protons in NMR suggests an alkene, not aromatic. So perhaps it's a conjugated diene or an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group.

So, maybe the compound is an ester with an adjacent double bond. Or perhaps a ketone with an adjacent hydroxyl group and a double bond.

Wait, but the IR has two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650. Let me think about possible functional groups. The 1700 is a carbonyl, like ester, ketone, aldehyde
