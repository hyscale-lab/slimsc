Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.

The question says the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me go through each piece of data one by one.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H groups. A broad peak could be from an alcohol (like an -OH) or maybe from a ketone? Wait, no, ketones have peaks around 1700. Oh wait, the very broad peak is more likely an O-H stretch. So the compound probably has an -OH group.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Okay, I remember that carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc.) absorb around 1700. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated or something else. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, but that's usually around 1600. Hmm, wait. Another possibility is an ester. Esters have two carbonyl peaks? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. For example, a conjugated ketone or an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone would have a lower wavenumber. Wait, 1650 is a bit lower than 1700, so maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is something else.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, an aromatic ring with C=C bonds can have peaks around 1600, but that's more like 1450-1600. The 1650 is a bit higher than that. Maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Moving on to the NMR data. The 1H NMR has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, perhaps part of a conjugated system. Like in an ester group maybe? Or perhaps it's a ketone with an adjacent double bond.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about what that could be. 45 could be (CH3O) group? No, because CH3O would be 31 (15 for O, 16 for CH3, wait 16+15=31). Alternatively, 45 could be CH2O (formaldehyde? No, that's 30). Wait, 45 as a fragmentâ€”maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, but that's 30. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from an ester. For example, maybe an ethyl group? No, wait, the molecular ion for CH3COO- would give a fragment. Wait, another angle: 45 could be the molecular ion of a small molecule like acetone (which is (CH3)2CO). Wait, acetone's molecular formula is C3H6O. Molecular weight: 3*12=36 + 6*1=6 +16=16. So 36+6+16=58. Hmm, not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from a larger molecule. Let's think about possible ions.

Wait, another common fragment is the tropylium ion, which is C7H7+ but that's 91. Hmm, not matching. Let me think about other possibilities. Maybe it's a methyl group attached to an oxygen. Wait, perhaps the fragment is CH2O with something else attached. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of CH3COOH (acetic acid). Wait, no, acetic acid is 60. Hmm. Alternatively, 45 could be (CH2)2O, but that's 44. Close. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl propionate or something else.

Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's compute possible fragments. For example, if the molecule breaks off into a smaller part. Let's say a CH2CH2O group? Wait, maybe a CH2CH3 group attached to something else. Alternatively, perhaps a ketone group. Wait, 45 as a possible (CH3)2CO fragment? No, acetone is 58. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the m/z 45 is a -CH3CO- group, but that's 57. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) fragment. Acetaldehyde is 44, but 45 would be the molecular ion plus one? Not sure.

Another approach: think about the molecular formula options given. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Looking at molecular formulas:

For C6H12O: molecular weight is 6*12 +12 +16=72+12+16=100.

C6H10O: 6*12=72 +10=82 +16=88. So 72+10+16= 98.

C6H10O2: 6*12=72 +10=82 + 32 (2O) = 104.

C6H12O2: 72 +12 +32= 116.

So the molecular ion would be at 100, 98, 104, or 116.

In the mass spectrum, a fragment at m/z=45 is present. So possible that the molecule breaks into a fragment with a mass of 45. Let's see what each formula could produce.

For example, if the formula is C6H10O2 (104), maybe it breaks into a fragment of 45. Let's see: 104-45=59. So the remaining fragment would be 59. What's 59? It could be a benzene ring (C7H5, which is 7*12 +5=89? No, that's too high. Or maybe a different structure.

Alternatively, if the formula is C6H12O2 (116), a fragment of 45 would leave 71 (116-45=71). What's 71? Could be a CH2CH2OCH2CH3 group? Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, 71 is the molecular weight of something else. Wait, 71 is  C4H9O? 4*12=48 +9=57 +16=63, no. Hmm.

Alternatively, the 45 could come from a carbonyl group. Let's think, maybe the molecule is an ester. Esters have the structure R-O-C-O-R. When they fragment, they can break into smaller parts. For example, an ethyl ester might break into an ethyl group (45? Wait, the molecular weight of CH2CH3O is 45. Because CH2CH3O is (12*2)+(1*5)+16=24+5+16=45. Wait, no, CH2CH3O would be C2H5O. So 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 16=16. 24+5+16=45. Oh wait, wait! Wait, so if the ester is something like R-O-CO-R', maybe when it breaks, the ester oxygen is involved. So, a fragment with C2H5O would be 45. So that would support the presence of an ethyl ester group, for example.

Wait, but the options don't include a C6H12O2 with an ethyl group necessarily. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, only two of them have two oxygen atoms: C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. So if the compound has two oxygen atoms, perhaps it's an ester or a ketone plus something else.

But wait, from the IR data, there's a peak at 1700 and 1650. An ester typically has a strong carbonyl peak around 1740-1700 cm^-1, but sometimes lower if it's conjugated. So 1700 could be the ester carbonyl. What about 1650? That could be the conjugated double bond in the ester, like if it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOO-R, which would give two peaks in IR.

Wait, but if the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, that suggests a double bond nearby, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Putting this together: the compound has an ester group (since IR shows 1700 cm^-1), and a conjugated double bond (1650 cm^-1), and an O-H group as the broad peak. Wait, but esters don't have O-H groups. Oh wait, but wait, if the compound is something like a diester or an acid ester? Hmm, no, maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the IR would have a broad peak if it's an acid, but then the ester peak would be different. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 is probably O-H. So the compound might have an O-H group and another carbonyl group. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but then the ester peak wouldn't be present. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound is an ester with an alcohol group. But that's a bit unlikely. Alternatively, it could be a ketone and an alcohol, but the IR peaks would be at different places.

Wait, maybe the compound is a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters have two carbonyl groups, so the IR would have two peaks. Let me think: beta-keto ester structure is something like RC(O)COOR'. The two carbonyls would have different peaks because of conjugation. The ketone group (RCO-) would absorb around 1700, and the ester (COOR') around 1740? Wait, no, I think the ester is lower because of conjugation. So, perhaps the 1700 is the ester, and 1650 is the ketone? Or vice versa.

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact wavenumbers. Maybe I should recall: esters typically have carbonyl around 1740-1710. If the ester is conjugated, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the carbonyl peak might be around 1700. So if the IR shows 1700 and 1650, perhaps the 1700 is the ester carbonyl, and the 1650 is another group, maybe a conjugated double bond or another carbonyl.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that suggests a double bond. So the structure might have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, making it an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

So, if it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOOR. That would explain the NMR peaks for vinyl hydrogens (the CH2=CH group), the IR peaks at 1700 (ester carbonyl) and 1650 (conjugated double bond). Then, why the broad peak at 3000? Oh, wait, that would be from an alcohol group. But in an ester, there's no O-H. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diol or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the compound has a hydroxyl group and an ester group. But that might make it a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the FTIR has multiple O-H groups. Wait, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the O-H would be very broad around 3000. But then, the IR would show a strong peak around 1700, which is a carboxylic acid carbonyl. But in this case, there are two peaks at 1700 and 1650. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an aromatic ester, like methyl benzoate. But benzoate would have a carbonyl around 1700, but where would the 1650 come from? Maybe the aromatic ring? No, aromatic C=C are around 1500. Hmm. So perhaps the 1650 peak is an alkene.

Wait, if the compound has an ester group (1700) and an alkene (1650), then the O-H would have to come from somewhere else. But if the compound doesn't have an O-H, why the broad peak?

Wait, unless the O-H is part of an alcohol group in the molecule. So maybe the compound is an ester and an alcohol. But that would require it to be a glycol ester or something, which seems less likely.

Wait, maybe the O-H is from a hemiacetal. Alternatively, maybe the compound is something like a substituted acetic acid with an ester group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3000 cm^-1 peak is from an amine. Wait, no, amines have N-H stretches around 3300-3500, broad. But the question says O-H, so amines are probably not the case.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the options again. The options are four different molecular formulas. So let's consider each one.

Option A: C6H12O2. Formula is C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0, N=0. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So 1 degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond.

Wait, wait, degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C +2 - H - X + N]/2. So C=6, H=12, O=2. So DoU=(2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2=(14-12)/2=1.

So one DoU: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. Maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (14-10)/2=2. So same as B.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (14-12)/2=1.

So, looking at the NMR: vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So at least one DoU is accounted for. So if the compound has a double bond, that uses one DoU, leaving another for a ring or another double bond.

Looking at the IR data, the 1700 and 1650 cm^-1 suggest two carbonyl groups or a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond.

If the compound has a carbonyl group and a double bond, then that would account for two DoU.

Wait, the initial DoU for each option:

Option A: DoU 1. But if
