Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain parameters. The star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, when they look at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), they notice this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm, okay, so the key here is understanding how the presence of spots affects the temperature and consequently the ionization state of Ti atoms, which in turn affects the ratio of their populations in different energy levels.

Wait, the photosphere is in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. That means the conditions in each region are uniform enough for standard equations to apply, like the Boltzmann equation for population ratios.

So first, I think the problem relates to the Saha equation because it deals with ionization and excitation states in stellar atmospheres. The Saha equation describes the ionization state of atoms in a stellar atmosphere, considering temperature and electron pressure. But wait, here we're talking about two energy levels of neutral Ti. Oh, right, the Boltzmann equation is more relevant for energy level populations within the same element.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations (n_upper / n_lower) is proportional to exp(-Î”E/(k T)) multiplied by (g_upper / g_lower), where g is the statistical weight. So when temperature changes, this ratio changes exponentially. But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. So the factor is ratio_no_spots / ratio_with_spots.

But wait, in this case, the effective temperature of the photosphere when there are spots is lower. So the star's overall temperature is 5500 K when 40% of its surface is spotted. Wait, but the spots are cooler regions, so when a significant part of the surface (like 40%) is covered, the overall Teff drops.

But how does this affect the photosphere's temperature? Are the spots regions where the temperature is lower than the surrounding? So the star's average temperature is lower when spots are present, but the unspotted regions are at 6000 K. Hmm, but the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered. Wait, maybe the star is a composite of hotter and cooler regions, but the effective temperature is an average.

Wait, but since the photosphere is in LTE, each region has a certain temperature. But when spots are present, the average temperature is lower. So when considering the star as a whole, the effective temperature (Teff) is the average, but for the photosphere, it's perhaps a mix of different regions. However, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the assumption is that the photosphere's temperature is 60
