Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f(y)(ψ_f(y))(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh right, the interaction term would involve the X field coupling to fermions, like maybe something like Xψψ, so the boson X couples to fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I think this means considering the possible decay channels where X can decay into a pair of fermions, subject to energy conservation.

Kinematically allowed means that the rest mass of X must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Because each fermion will have some rest mass, and when X is at rest, each decay product must have enough energy to account for their rest mass. So, m_X ≥ 2m_f for each possible fermion pair.

So first, what fermions are available? The options given include pairs like b, s, u, d, tau, electrons, muons, and even top quarks in one option. Let's list the masses of these fermions.

I remember the approximate masses:
- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV (0.5 MeV)
- Muon (μ): about 0.105 GeV (105 MeV)
- Tau (τ): around 1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): very light, around 2 MeV (so 0.002 GeV)
- Down quark (d): similar to u, maybe around 3-5 MeV. Let's say 0.004 GeV.
- Strange quark (s): about 95-100 MeV, so around 0.095 GeV.
- Charm quark (c): around 1.2 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.7 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way heavy, about 173 GeV.

Wait, wait, X is 6 GeV. So when considering each decay channel, each fermion pair must have a combined mass ≤ 6 GeV.

So X → f f̄. So 2m_f ≤ m_X → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So each fermion must have a mass ≤3 GeV. Let's look at each possibility:

Electron: 0.0005 GeV → yes, 0.001 GeV <3 GeV. So e+ e- is allowed.
Same for muons: 0.105 GeV, so their mass is way below 3 GeV. So μ+ μ- is allowed.
Tau: 1.777 GeV <3 → allowed.
For quarks:
u: 0.002 GeV → yes.
d: 0.004 GeV → yes.
s: 0.095 GeV → yes.
c: 1.2 GeV → 1.2 <3 → allowed.
b: 4.7 GeV → wait, 4.7 is bigger than 3, so b quark is too heavy. So X can't decay into b b̄, because 2*4.7=9.4>6 GeV. So that's not allowed.

Top quark is even heavier, so X can't decay into t t̄ either.

So the possible fermions are: e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but what about the masses of the quarks when considering decay? Also, do I need to consider if the coupling is possible? The Lagrangian given is -λ f f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, not sure about the exact structure, but perhaps the form is similar to Yukawa coupling. So the interaction term could be something like X ψ ψ. If X is coupling to all the fermions, then in principle, X can decay into any fermion pair that satisfies the mass condition.

So the possible decay channels are X → e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ−, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c
