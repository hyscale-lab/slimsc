Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, right? Let me read it again.

So, we've got Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2's. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass scale by the same factor. The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. The formula is Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same? Because lambda_max is directly proportional to 1/T. So T_1 = T_2.

Wait, but wait. If the stars have the same temperature, then their luminosity can be determined using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both have the same T, the luminosity would depend on R squared. Oh wait, but wait. The problem says they computed the luminosity, but I need to consider other factors like their velocities maybe? Or is that a red herring?

Wait, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So I think that the peak wavelengths are observed to be the same, which would imply that any Doppler shift would have to correct for their velocities. Maybe their actual temperatures are different, but their observed peak wavelengths are same because of the Doppler shift. Oh, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, let me think again. The observed wavelength is due to the star's actual emission, but Doppler shift can change the observed wavelength. So, if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its light would be blueshifted, meaning the observed peak wavelength is shorter than its actual. Conversely, if Star_1 is not moving, the observed wavelength is the same as the emitted (assuming no other factors). So, the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So, the actual emitted wavelengths would be different. Let me write down the Doppler effect formula.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), but wait, I think for small velocities, we can approximate it as (1 + v/c) where v is positive for redshift. Wait, no, the exact formula depends on the direction of
