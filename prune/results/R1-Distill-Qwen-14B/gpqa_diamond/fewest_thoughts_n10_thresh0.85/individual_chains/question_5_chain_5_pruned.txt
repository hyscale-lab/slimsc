Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P is given with its X, Y, Z components as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement is made. So the eigenvector here must correspond to the state where the operator P has a definite value of +ħ/2.

But wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, so it's like a spin component in the direction n, which is a combination of x and z. Right, because in the x-z plane, any direction can be represented using an angle θ from the z-axis, I think. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but since we're in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

Wait, no. Wait, in the x-z plane, the direction can be parametrized by an angle φ perhaps? Or is it θ? Let me think. For a direction in the x-z plane, the vector can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) in the x, y, z directions. But since the operator is along n, the operator would be P = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because P is a vector operator, and the component in the direction of n is the dot product of P with n.

So first, I should construct the matrix for the operator P along n. Let me write that out.

P = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Each of P_x, P_y, P_z are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, the problem gives P_x as (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]. And P_y is (ħ/2)*[[0, -i],[i, 0]]. But since P is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So P_y won't be part of the operator, right? Because our direction n is in x-z, so the projection is only x and z.

So the operator P along n is (ħ/2) times [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Let me compute that matrix. Let me denote the matrix as M, so:

M = sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So M becomes:

Top left element: sinθ * 0 + cosθ * 1 = cosθ.

Top right: sinθ * 1 + cosθ * 0 = sinθ.

Bottom left: sinθ * 1 + cosθ *0 = sinθ.

Bottom right: sinθ * 0 + cosθ * (-1) = -cosθ.

So M is [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]]. Then, operator P is (ħ/2) * M.

We need to find the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So let's write the eigenvalue equation:

P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

Substituting P, we have (ħ/2) M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

M |ψ> = |ψ>.

So the matrix M has to have an eigenvalue of 1. So we need to solve (M - I) |ψ> = 0.

Let me write the matrix (M - I):

[cosθ - 1, sinθ]
[sinθ, -cosθ -1]

So the equation is:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ * b = 0
sinθ * a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Where a and b are the components of the eigenvector |ψ> = [a; b].

Let me write these as equations:

1) (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Hmm, let's solve equation 1 for a in terms of b.

From equation 1:
( cosθ -1 ) a = - sinθ b
a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

But cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So substituting:

a = [ - (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / (-2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negatives cancel, so numerator is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), denominator is 2 sin²(θ/2).

So a = [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b

Simplify:

a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] b
=> a = cot(θ/2) b

Wait, but let me check the substitution again.

cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ
