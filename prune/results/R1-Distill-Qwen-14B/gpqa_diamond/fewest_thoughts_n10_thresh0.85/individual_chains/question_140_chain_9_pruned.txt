Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W, form a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what substance X and the other substances might be.

So, the reaction between X and Y is violent. That makes me think of metals reacting with acids, maybe something like magnesium reacting with sulfuric acid? Or perhaps something more basic. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction that produces hydrogen gas, which is common in such reactions.

The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Wait, each atom's neutrons and protons are equal? Or the molecule as a whole? Because for a molecule, the total number of protons and neutrons would be the sum for all atoms. But if it's each individual atom in the molecule, that would require each atom to have equal protons and neutrons. Like, for example, deuterium has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so each molecule of D2 would have 2 of each, but wait, no, each D atom has 1 p and 1 n, so two D atoms make a molecule with 2 p and 2 n. So the total is equal, but the question says same number of neutrons and protons in the molecule. So each molecule of W has the same number of protons as neutrons.

Wait, maybe it's a molecule with H and O, like H2O. But H has 1 proton, O has 8. That
