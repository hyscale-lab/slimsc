Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's try to think through this.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or mean proper decay length) depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula is something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Oh right, because gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, and tau is the proper lifetime.

So first, I need to find the lifetime tau of the meson. I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / tau. But wait, let me double-check the units. Gamma is given in MeV, which is an energy unit. Oh, right! The natural units where ħ = c = 1 are often used in particle physics, but sometimes conversions are needed.

Wait, actually, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime tau by Γ = ħ / tau. So tau is ħ divided by Γ. But I need to make sure the units are correct. Let me recall the constants.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Gamma is given in MeV, so I should convert that to GeV to match the units. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So tau is about 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 2.056875e-25? No, wait: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, okay.

But wait, I think I should be careful with the calculation here. Let me redo that division. 6.582 divided by 0.32: 0.32 goes into 6.582 how many times? 0.32 * 20 is 6.4, so 20 times with 0.182 left. 0.32 * 0.56 is about 0.1792, so total 20.56, which gives 20.56875. So yes, 20.56875 times 1e-25 s gives 2.056875e-24 seconds. So tau is approximately 2.057e-24 seconds.

Next step is to find the velocity beta and the Lorentz factor gamma. The particle's energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and mass m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can find the velocity and gamma from these.

The total energy E is gamma * m c², but since we're in units where c=1, E = gamma m. So gamma = E / m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

Beta can be found from gamma and the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Rearranging, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So let's compute beta. Gamma is 6.6667, so 1/gamma² is 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Take the square root: sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute that more accurately. Let me compute 1/gamma²: (8/1.2) is 20/3 ≈6.6666667. So (20/3)^2 is 400/9 ≈44.4444. So 1/(gamma²) is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 9/400 = (400-9)/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.

The square root of 0.9775 is sqrt(0.9775). Let me calculate that. I know that sqrt(0.96) is about 0.98, sqrt(0.9801) is 0.99. Let me compute (0.9887)^2: 0.9887 * 0.9887. Let me compute 0.9887 squared.

Hmm, 0.9887^2 = (0.98)^2 + 0.0087^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 98.87^2 = (98 + 0.87)^2 = 98^2 + 2*98*0.87 + 0.87^2 = 9604 + 170. 88 + 0.7569. So 9604 + 170.88 is 9774.88, plus 0.7569 gives 9775.6369. So 98.87^2 is 9775.6369, so 0.9887^2 is 0.97756369. Which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So perhaps the square root of 0.9775 is about 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So now, v = beta c, but when calculating the mean decay length, we'll need beta * gamma * c * tau.

Wait, the mean decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau, right? Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, and then the distance is velocity (beta c) times that time. So L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The proper lifetime is tau. The lifetime in the lab
