Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A) 10^-9 eV, B) 10^-11 eV, C) 10^-4 eV, D) 10^-8 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. I think the uncertainty in time here is the lifetime of the state because the state doesn't last forever. So for each energy level, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy.

Wait, but the question is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So we need the energy difference between E2 and E1 to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we can't tell them apart; they would blend together in measurements.

So let me calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state. The lifetimes are τ1 = 1e-9 sec and τ2 = 1e-8 sec.

The uncertainty principle says ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ). Because ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, maybe it's easier to convert everything into eV and seconds.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So let me compute ΔE for each state.

First, for τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (2τ1) = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s)
= (1.05e-34) / (2e-9) = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-25 J
= 0.525e-25 J.

Now converting to eV: since 1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV,
0.525e-25 J = 0.525e-25 / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ (0.525 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV ≈ 0.3277 * 1e-6 eV ≈ 3.277e-7 eV.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the exponents. Wait, 1e-34 divided by 1e-9 is 1e-25? Because 1e-34 / 1e-9 = 1e-25. Yes, that's correct.

So 1e-25 J is 1e-25 / (1.6e-19) eV. Let's compute that:

1e-25 / 1.6e-19 = (1/1.6) * 1e-6 = 0.625e-6 eV = 6.25e-7 eV. So for ΔE1, it's about 6.25e-7 eV.

Wait, what about τ2 = 1e-8 s?

ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-8) = 0.525e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 0.525e-26 J = 0.525e-26 / 1.6e-19 eV = (0.525 / 1.6) * 1e-7 eV ≈ 0.3281 * 1e-7 ≈ 3.281e-8 eV.

Wait, so ΔE1 is about 6.25e-7 eV and ΔE2 is about 3.28e-8 eV.

Wait, but the energy difference between E2 and E1 is ΔE = E2 - E1. To distinguish them, the actual energy difference should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the combined uncertainty, you can't resolve them.

Wait no, perhaps not the sum. Because each state's uncertainty is their own ΔE. So the uncertainty in the measured energy would be the maximum of the two uncertainties, or perhaps the combination in quadrature. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum ΔE needed is the maximum of the two ΔE's.

Wait, maybe I should think about the resolving power in spectroscopy. In energy measurements, the uncertainty in energy should be less than the energy difference between the two states for them to be distinguishable.

So for two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the uncertainties are ΔE1 and ΔE2. The energy difference must be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties, or perhaps the larger uncertainty.

Wait, perhaps the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because if the energy difference is larger than the maximum ΔE, then you can resolve them.

Wait, let me think again. Each state's energy has an uncertainty. So when you measure the energy, the possible true value could be anywhere in the range E ± ΔE. So to ensure that the two ranges don't overlap, the difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2, then their intervals don't overlap.

Wait, but in this case, each state's energy has its own uncertainty. So for E1, the measured energy would be E1' = E1 ± ΔE1, and for E2, E2' = E2 ± ΔE2.

To avoid overlap, E2 - ΔE2 > E1 + ΔE1 → ΔE2 + ΔE1 < E2 - E1.

Wait, but the question gives the lifetimes for the two states. So each state's energy has its own uncertainty. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be greater than the sum of the uncertainties from both states.

So the condition is |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

In our case, E1 has τ1, so ΔE1 is about 6.25e-7 eV. E2 has τ2, so ΔE2 is about 3.28e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ 6.25e-7 + 0.0328e-7 = approximately 6.28e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than 6.28e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 0.001e-6 < 6.28e-7 → No.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller, no.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → 0.0001 is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is much larger than 6.28e-7. Because 6.28e-7 is 0.000000628 eV, while 1e-4 is 0.0001 e
