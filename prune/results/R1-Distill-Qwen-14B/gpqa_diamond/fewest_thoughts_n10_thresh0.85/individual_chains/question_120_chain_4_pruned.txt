Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance—yeah, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Right, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs).

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. So their actual number depends on the volume they occupy. Oh wait, if they're uniformly distributed, the number should depend on the volume available at a certain distance.

Let me think about this. The number of stars per unit volume is constant because they're uniformly distributed. So I need to find how the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d relates to the parallax.

Parallax plx is 1/d. So for a thin shell of thickness dr, the volume would be the surface area of the sphere times dr. Surface area is 4πd². So the volume is 4π d² dr.

But wait, we're dealing with parallax here. Let's express d in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. Then dr would be - (1/plx²) d plx, since d = 1/plx, so dr = -1/(plx²) d plx. Wait, because as plx increases, d decreases. So when plx increases by d plx, d decreases by a negative dr. But when we express the volume in terms of plx, we can take the absolute value.

Expressing the volume in terms of plx. Volume dV = 4π d² dr. Substituting d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx²). And dr is -(1/plx²) d plx, so dr = -d plx / plx² = -d plx / plx² = -d / plx. Wait, but since we're considering a small change in plx (d plx), the negative sign just indicates direction, so for the purpose of counting stars, we take the absolute value. So dr = d plx / plx².

Putting it all together, dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (d plx / plx²) )= 4π d plx / plx^4.

Wait, no, wait. Let me redo that. So dV (in terms of plx) is 4π d² dr, but dr is expressed in terms of d plx.

Since d = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) d plx. So, the volume element is dV = 4π (d^2) dr = 4π (1/plx^2) * (-d plx / plx²) ) = 4π (-d plx) / plx^4. But the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, the distance decreases, so for counting purposes, we can ignore the sign and just take the magnitude.

So dV = 4π d plx / plx^4.

But since d is 1/plx, substituting, we get dV = 4π (1/plx) * d plx / plx^4 = 4π d plx / plx^5.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I messed up the substitution.

Wait another approach: Let me think about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dr. The volume is 4π d² dr. So the number of stars in this shell would be (number density) * volume. Number density is constant, N0.

So the number of stars N = N0 * 4π d² dr.

But we want the number per unit range of plx (d plx). So we can express this in terms of plx.

Since plx = 1/d, dr = - (1/d²) d plx. Because d = 1/plx, so dr = - (plx^2) d plx.

Wait, wait, let's calculate dr in terms of d plx. Since plx = 1/d, so d plx = - (1/d²) dr. Solving for
