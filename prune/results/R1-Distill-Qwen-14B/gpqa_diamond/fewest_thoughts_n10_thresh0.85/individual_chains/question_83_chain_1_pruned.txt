Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, it will react with NaOH, a strong base, to form its conjugate base, acetate ion, and water.

First, I should find out the initial concentrations after dilution. When we mix equal volumes of acid and water, the concentration should be halved because the volume doubles. So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = Molarity * Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Right, so C = 0.025 M.

Then, during titration with NaOH. The first part is the pH at 25% titration. I think 25% means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Let's think about the stoichiometry.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na^+ + H2O.

So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

First, calculate the moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. So the moles of acetic acid left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed would be 0.00025 mol.

But wait, because when you add NaOH, you're adding both moles and volume. Let me think about the solution's volume at 25% titration. Hmm, maybe I should compute the volume of NaOH added at 25% and then find the total volume.

Wait, what's the equivalence point volume? That's when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So 25% titration is 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³.

So the total solution volume at 25% is 40 cm³ (original) + 2.5 cm³ (NaOH) = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So in this solution, after adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH:

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 - (0.00025) = 0.00075 mol. Because moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, this is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So, Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.738.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 1.85e-5 → log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733.

Wait, wait, no: 1.85e-5 is 1.85 × 10
