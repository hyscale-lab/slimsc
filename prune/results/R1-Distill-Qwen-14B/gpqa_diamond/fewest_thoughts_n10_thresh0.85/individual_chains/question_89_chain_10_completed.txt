--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think it out.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage structure. So, 1,3-dibromo means there are bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons in the adamantane structure.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe it's a double elimination. Wait, but where? Adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. If each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps the elimination would form a double bond between those positions.

Wait, when you eliminate two HBr molecules, you'd form a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe it's more about dehydrohalogenation. Alternatively, considering the positions, maybe it's a diene that's formed.

The product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Looking at the NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but the starting material is all hydrocarbons and Br. So how does a carbonyl form?

Wait, maybe I was wrong. If KOH is acting as a base, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation but in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but with such a structure, elimination is more likely.

Wait, another possibility: Could it be that heating with KOH leads to the formation of an epoxide? No, epoxides typically form from alkenes with peracids. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters.

Hmm, wait another thought. Maybe the KOH isn't just eliminating. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines, but maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbocation, but with adamantane's structure, that's a bit difficult. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination leading to a diene.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe elimination followed by some oxidation? But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or some E2 mechanism. Maybe two E2 eliminations happen, forming a conjugated diene. Then, could that diene undergo some reaction? Or perhaps the diene is then oxidized, but I don't think so because the KOH is just a base.

Wait, but the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps the product after KOH is a ketone or an ester.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a diene. Then, that diene reacts further under these conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. Wait, but how?

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR. The integration adds up to 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 H. Adamantane has 12 carbons, but the starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, would have 12 carbons plus two Br. The product after KOH should have similar or fewer carbons, but maybe some functional groups.

At 4.79 ppm, that's a singlet integrating for 2H. Maybe an -OCH2- group? Or perhaps a ketone group adjacent to some CH2. Wait, but 4.79 is a bit high for a CH2 attached to O. Hmm.

Wait, 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. So if the product is a diketone, then where would the protons be?

Wait, but before that, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination to form a diene, and then something else happens. But wait, the product after KOH is 1, right?

Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a ring-opening. But adamantane is pretty unreactive except under specific conditions. Hmm.

Wait another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, may undergo dehydrohalogenation, but since there are two bromines, perhaps it forms a cyclopropane or something else. Wait, no, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a nucleophilic substitution, but with two leaving groups, perhaps a double substitution.

Wait, wait, I'm getting stuck on the first step. Let me think about the possible products.

Let me look at the NMR data again. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 10H in the middle region could be the adamantane skeleton, maybe some CH2 groups. The 2H at 4.79 could be an -OCH2O- group, but that's speculative.

Wait, another angle: The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ could be a ketone. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the starting material underwent some oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless, wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl group via some mechanism.

Wait, maybe the two eliminations form a conjugated diene, which then undergoes some reaction to form a ketone. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxide, but I don't think so because the IR would show different peaks.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction produces an epoxide via some mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol. But a diol would have OH protons, which might not show up in the given NMR since they may have been exchanged. But the IR peak at 1720 doesn't fit a diol. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's a diketone. So, maybe two ketone groups are present. But how would the structure look?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester. But the starting material doesn't have any ester groups. Wait, maybe the elimination forms a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. So each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group? But that's not possible because you can't have two ketones in that position.

Wait, perhaps each Br is eliminated to form a double bond, but that would form a diene. How does that lead to a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps the base is causing a ring contraction or expansion, but I'm not familiar with that for adamantane.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic ether. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the IR. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So the product must have a carbonyl group. Now, KOH is a strong base, but it can also act as a nucleophile in substitution reactions. So maybe the two Br atoms undergo substitution but with what?

Wait, perhaps KOH is causing an elimination to form a double bond, but that doesn't directly lead to a carbonyl. Unless it's a peroxide condition, but no peroxide is mentioned.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Cope elimination, but that typically requires specific structures like 1,5-dienes. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic structure with a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via some kind of oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless there's an elimination followed by some rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I don't see how that would fit here.

I'm stuck on the first step. Maybe I should think about the subsequent steps and see if that gives me any clues.

So, product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a strong Lewis acid catalyst. It's often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So maybe product 1 is an acylated or alkylated compound.

Wait, product 1 has a carbonyl group, so perhaps it's a ketone. Then, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it could undergo some alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and upon treatment with Lewis acid, it undergoes some kind of cyclization.

Wait, but product 2 is then treated with ozone at low temperature (-78°C), followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond that gets cleaved in product 3.

So, if product 3 has fragments from ozonolysis, then product 2 must have had a double bond. Let me retrace.

Product 1 is what's formed after KOH. Then product 2 is formed by heating with Al(OiPr)3. So product 2 has a double bond that is cleaved by ozone.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, which upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3 undergoes some elimination to form a double bond. But earlier, I thought product 1 had a carbonyl, not a diol.

Alternatively, product 1 could be an epoxide, which upon treatment with a Lewis acid could form a carbocation, leading to rearrangement or elimination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkylated ketone with a double bond adjacent.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3, maybe it undergoes a Friedel-Crafts acylation if there's an aromatic ring, but adamantane doesn't have aromatic rings. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane with a ketone group, and upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3, a ring-opening occurs, or another reaction forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a pinacol rearrangement product. Pinacol rearrangement is when a diol (1,2-glycol) under acidic conditions forms a carbonyl. But in that case, product 1 would be a diol. But the IR of product 1 is 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl, so product 1 is a carbonyl compound.

So maybe product 1 is a diketone.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction with KOH converts the dibromide into a diketone via elimination. How? Because dehydrohalogenation typically forms alkenes, not carbonyls. Unless it's a neighboring group participation, but I don't think that's common here.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a β-H, leading to the formation of a carbocation, followed by loss of Br⁻. But in that case, you get an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons. Wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so they are on opposite bridgeheads. So if each Br is eliminated, maybe it forms a double bond across the bridge.

Wait, but that's a long distance, so maybe it's not feasible. Alternatively, perhaps each elimination occurs on the same carbon, but that doesn't make sense with 1,3 positions.

Hmm, perhaps the product after KOH is 1,3-diketone adamantane. So, two ketone groups at 1 and 3 positions.

If that's the case, then product 1 would be a diketone. Then, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, maybe it undergoes some kind of enolate formation or alkylation.

Wait, but Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid. Maybe it's used to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, then an intramolecular attack occurs, forming a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but adamantane isn't aromatic, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the diketone undergoes some kind of cyclization under Lewis acid conditions. Maybe forming a bridge with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a diol, but then the IR doesn't fit. So perhaps I was wrong about the first step.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, and then that diene reacts with KOH in some way. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a dialkyl ether. If the two bromines are replaced by oxygen atoms, but that would require some kind of substitution, which might not form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonate or something else, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: The NMR data. Let's think about the peaks.

The 4.79 ppm peak is 2H. That could be an -OCH2- group, like an ether or an ester. Or perhaps a CH2 attached to an electronegative atom.

The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) could be CH2 groups in the adamantane structure, perhaps some bridgehead CH2 groups.

The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another type of CH2, maybe near a carbonyl.

So putting this together, perhaps product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a ketone group and an ether group. Or perhaps an ester.

Wait, but the IR says 1720, which is a carbonyl. So either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid (though acids usually have broader peaks around 1700).

If it's a ketone, then 4.79 ppm might be a CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl, like CH2-CO-. But the chemical shift for CH2 next to a ketone is usually lower, around 2.5-3.5 ppm. 4.79 is more like an oxygen-bearing group, like OCH2.

Wait, perhaps the product has an epoxide ring. Because epoxide protons can be around 3.5-4.5 ppm. So 4.79 could be an epoxide. But then the IR would show an epoxide peak, which is around 1250-1300 cm⁻¹, but the given IR is 1720, which doesn't match that.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the initial product is a diene, and then subsequent steps form a carbonyl.

Wait, after product 1, the next step is heating with excess Al(OiPr)3, a Lewis acid. Maybe product 1 is a diene, and the Lewis acid catalyzes a reaction, perhaps a cyclization.

Wait, product 2 is then ozonized. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond, which upon ozonolysis forms product 3.

So, putting it all together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (light yellow solid, 1720 cm⁻¹ in IR).
2. Product 1 → product 2 (heated with Al(OiPr)3).
3. Product 2 → product 3 (ozonolysis).

So, let's think about product 1. If it's a diketone, then product 2 could have a double bond. How?

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes a cyclization. Maybe a conjugated di-enone is formed, which then can undergo ozonolysis.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, which when treated with Al(OiPr)3 forms an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene, but then the IR wouldn't show 1720 cm⁻¹. Unless product 1 is a diene with a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane ketone. Then, treatment with Al(OiPr)3 could cause ring-opening or form a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone and product 2 is an enol ether or similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is a product of some addition.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically breaks it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

So, the NMR of product 3 would show signals from the carbonyl-adjacent protons. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

So, the most deshielded proton is likely near a carbonyl group. Its coupling would depend on the neighboring protons.

In ozonolysis, if the double bond was between two CH2 groups, after cleavage, each would have a carbonyl, and the protons adjacent would be on either side.

Wait, for example, if the double bond was CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes (if both ends are CH2), but that's not possible because each end would be a CH2 group, which upon ozonolysis would form formaldehyde. But that's a trivial case.

Alternatively, maybe the double bond was part of a cyclopropane or a more complex structure.

Wait, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is part of a ring, so when ozonolysis occurs, it forms two carbonyl groups and leaves some protons that are near each other.

Wait, let's think about a simple case. If the double bond in product 2 is between two CH groups, each attached to other groups. Ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups, and the protons adjacent to them would be on adjacent carbons.

For example, imagine a structure like CH2=CH. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, but that's not realistic. More likely, the structure is more complex.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with the protons adjacent to the carbonyls being the most deshielded. Those protons would be next to the carbonyl groups and would have coupling with their neighboring protons.

The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring Hs and their splitting.

If a proton is adjacent to a carbonyl and has two neighboring Hs on each side, it could split into a triplet or more.

Wait, for example, if a proton is next to two equivalent protons on one side and another two on the other, but perhaps it's a geminal situation.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis has a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, with adjacent CH2 groups on each side.

Wait, maybe the double bond in product 2 was in a position where each end is a CH2 group attached to a larger structure. Upon ozonolysis, each CH2 becomes a carbonyl group, perhaps forming two ketones.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a simple CH2-CH2 would form two aldehydes, each with a CH2 group leading to CO groups. But in reality, it's more likely that the double bond is in a more substituted position.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond was part of a cyclopropane, which upon ozonolysis forms a diketone with adjacent protons.

Wait, perhaps product 3 has a structure where a CH group is adjacent to a carbonyl on each side. So the CH would have two neighboring groups, each with a certain number of protons.

Alternatively, maybe the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and this CH2 is next to another CH2 group. So each H in the CH2 would couple with Hs from adjacent groups.

Wait, let's imagine a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-. But that's a straight chain, which is unlikely in adamantane derivatives.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like a cyclic diketone, where the protons are in a rigid environment.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded proton is a methine (CH) group adjacent to two carbonyl groups. But that's a possibility. In that case, the CH would be split by neighboring Hs.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each H in that CH2 couples with Hs from adjacent CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each H in that CH2 is coupling with two sets of neighboring Hs.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is in a position where it's adjacent to two different types of neighboring Hs. For example, it might be split by two neighboring groups, each providing a different coupling. So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the proton is next to two neighboring groups, each with one H, then it would be a triplet.

Wait, let me think about the possible coupling. If a proton has two neighboring Hs on one side and one on the other, perhaps it would split into a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another example: if a proton is next to two sets of two equivalent Hs, its splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, for instance, if there's a CH2-CH2 group adjacent, the Hs would couple with the two Hs on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if a proton is next to a CH and a CH2, the couplings would be from each, leading to more complex splitting.

Hmm. Let me think about a specific example. Suppose the structure after ozonolysis is something like:

R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R'

In this case, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would have their protons deshielded. Each H in the CH2 would have neighboring Hs from their own group and from the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but in reality, ozonolysis tends to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a structure like:

R-CH2-CH2-R'

with a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene, which upon ozonolysis forms two carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a ring structure with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the ring, forming a chain with carbonyls.

Wait, considering all this, perhaps the most deshielded H in product 3 is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl group. Each of these Hs would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group.

So, each H in the CH2 would couple with two Hs on one side and two on the other. Wait, no, if it's a straight chain, like CO-CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 is adjacent to the other. So the Hs on the left CH2 would couple with the two Hs on their own CH2 (maybe as a triplet) and with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the coupling is between two neighboring groups, each with two Hs, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. So the H would be a triplet from coupling with each adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but each H is adjacent to two Hs on its own CH2 (geminal coupling?), but wait, geminal coupling is usually not observed because they're equivalent.

Wait, geminal protons are equivalent and don't split each other. Vicinal protons (on adjacent carbons) do split. So, each H on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

So each H would have two neighboring Hs on the next CH2. So each H would split into a triplet.

But wait, if each H is coupled with two Hs from the next CH2, that would be a triplet for each coupling. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, leading to a 9-line pattern, which is a triplet of triplets.

But the options don't have that. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Wait, option B is triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two different sets of Hs, leading to a doublet of triplets or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each H is next to one H on one side and two on the other. Or next to two on one side and one on the other.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is adjacent to two different sets of Hs with different coupling constants, leading to a more complex splitting.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH is next to two other CH groups, each with two Hs. Then, each H would have coupling with two Hs on each adjacent group.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the possible structures leading to the NMR spectrum.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Such a CH would have two neighboring groups, each with a certain number of Hs.

Wait, if the structure is something like:

O=C-CH(CH3)-CO

Then, the CH would have two neighboring Hs from the CH3. But that doesn't fit the deshielded position.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic diketone, like cyclopentanedione. In such a structure, the CH2 groups adjacent to the ketones would have their protons deshielded. Each CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2 group, leading to coupling between the Hs.

In cyclopentanedione, the ring is five-membered with two ketone groups opposite each other. The CH2 groups between them would each have two Hs. The protons on each CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in reality, cyclopentanedione's NMR shows the CH2 groups as triplets because each H is next to two Hs on the same CH2 (but they're equivalent, so no splitting) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would split into a triplet, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But in the options, option B is triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each H is adjacent to two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, putting it all together, the most deshielded H would be part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, with each H coupling with two Hs from an adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the options don't have a triplet of triplets as an option. Wait, looking back, option B is triplet of triplets.

Wait, no, the options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, B is an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group with two neighboring CH2 groups, each contributing two Hs, leading to a doublet of quartets, but that's not any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group, which has two Hs. So each H in the CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet. Additionally, if the CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two Hs there, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, if each H in the CH2 has two coupling partners (each with two Hs), the splitting would be a triplet for each coupling, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

Therefore, the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves determining the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, which is formed after a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   - The starting material undergoes dehydrohalogenation, likely forming a conjugated diene. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group. This suggests that further reactions may involve carbonyl-containing intermediates.

2. **Reaction 2: Heating product 1 with Al(OiPr)₃**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates a reaction that introduces a double bond into the structure (product 2). This double bond is positioned such that it can undergo ozonolysis in the next step.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. The cleavage introduces carbonyl groups, and the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to one of these carbonyl groups.

4. **Analysis of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group. Its coupling pattern depends on the number and arrangement of neighboring hydrogens. If the hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group, each hydrogen in the CH₂ group will couple with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group. This results in a triplet of triplets coupling pattern due to the splitting from two sets of two equivalent hydrogens.

5. **Evaluation of the options**  
   - **A) Triplet**: This would occur if the hydrogen coupled with only two equivalent hydrogens.  
   - **B) Triplet of triplets**: This occurs if the hydrogen couples with two sets of two equivalent hydrogens, as in a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group.  
   - **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would occur if the hydrogen coupled with one hydrogen and then with two equivalent hydrogens, which is not consistent with the structure.  
   - **D) Pentet**: This would occur if the hydrogen coupled with four equivalent hydrogens, which is not consistent with the structure.  

The correct coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, as described in option B.

**Answer: B**
