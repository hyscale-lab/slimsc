Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, it's about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says it's a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. They're asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, interatomic distance... right, in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms along the lattice. For a cubic system, it's straightforward, but rhombohedral is a bit more complex.

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal, but the angles can be different. Oh wait, in this case, all angles are 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedron with a cubic lattice but with all angles equal to 30 degrees. Wait, no. Wait, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system, but in this case, it's a special case where all angles are the same. So it's a rhombohedral or trigonal crystal.

The interplanar distance (d) for a plane (hkl) in a crystal is given by the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2(hk + kl + lh))/(a² cos θ)

Wait, no, maybe that's for a hexagonal system. Alternatively, I remember that for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula involving the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, another approach. The general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is derived from the unit cell. For a general rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, b, c, but in this case, it's a rhombohedral system so a = b = c = interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms. The angles between the axes are all 30 degrees.

The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + kl cos β + lh cos γ) )

Wait, but in this case, since all angles are 30 degrees, and the lattice is rhombohedral, so a = b = c, and α = β = γ = 30°. So the formula simplifies.

So for the (111
