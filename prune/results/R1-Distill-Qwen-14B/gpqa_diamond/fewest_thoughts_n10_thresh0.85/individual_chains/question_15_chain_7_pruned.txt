Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

The question is about determining which of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting its host star. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability because they have limited time. Both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives us their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Alright, the key points given are:

1. Both planets have the same mass.
2. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P_2 /3.
3. Both have circular orbits.
4. The host stars have the same radii, even though their masses are different. The star hosting Planet_1 (Star_1) has twice the mass of Planet_2's star (Star_2). So M1 = 2M2, but R1 = R2.

The options suggest that the probability of transit depends on some factors, and we have to calculate which planet is more likely to transit.

From what I remember, the probability of a planet transiting its host star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. But wait, more specifically, the transit probability is higher when the orbital plane is aligned edge-on to our line of sight. But since both planets are already known via RV method, their orbits are likely to be in some random orientation. However, the RV method detects planets through Doppler shifts, which gives information about the mass and the period, but doesn't directly inform the inclination. So for the transit probability, we need to consider the geometric probability, which is the chance that the orbital plane is edge-on enough for the planet to pass in front of the star from our perspective.

The formula for the geometric probability (P) of a transit is something like P = (R_p + R_s) / a, where R_p is the planet's radius, R_s is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, I might be mixing up some terms here. Alternatively, another formula I've come across is P = (R_s + R_p) / a. Wait, but actually, I think the geometric probability is given by P = (R_*/ (a (1 - e^2)^0.5)), where e is the eccentricity. But since both planets have circular orbits, e=0, so it simplifies to (R_*) / a.

Wait, but I think that the correct formula for the transit probability (assuming uniform random distribution of orbital inclinations) is P = (R_*/a) / (1 + (M_p / M_* )^(1/3)) ), but that might be dependent on the method of detection. Hmm. Alternatively, another way: the probability that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough for a transit is approximately (R_*/a), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait no, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p + R_*) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, especially for Earth-like planets, we can approximate P ≈ (R_*/a). So the transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

But wait, let me think again. The formula for geometric probability is the area where the planet's orbit can transit relative to the observer's line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. So yes, P = (R_*) / (a (1 - e²)^(1/2)). Again, since e=0, P = R_*/a.

But wait, another factor: the RV method gives us the minimum mass of the planet because it depends on the sine of the inclination (i). The RV method determines M sin i, so we can only know the minimum mass. So if a planet's inclination is more edge-on, the RV method would detect a higher mass. But for this problem, I think the masses are the same, so perhaps the actual masses are the same, so inclination is the same. Or maybe not. Wait, no. Both planets have the same minimum mass, but their actual masses could be higher
