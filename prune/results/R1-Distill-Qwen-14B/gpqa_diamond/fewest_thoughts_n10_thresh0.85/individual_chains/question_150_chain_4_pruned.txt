Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take a deep breath and start breaking it down.

So, the question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's eight carbons, nine hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Let me think about the possible structures. 

The NMR data given is 1H-NMR in ppm. Let me list out the peaks and what they might indicate. 

9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H): That's a pretty high chemical shift. Could be an aldehyde proton or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution, but aldehyde is more likely in this case. Wait, but wait, the triplet might be from coupling with adjacent groups. If it's an aldehyde, it would usually be a singlet or maybe a doublet if adjacent to something that has coupling. Hmm, but a triplet suggests maybe coupling with two different protons? Not sure yet.

6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H): This looks like aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted? Because in a para-substituted benzene, you get two sets of doublets. Like, for example, in para-substituted rings, you have two protons as a doublet each, but wait, no, maybe a doublet of two protons each. Wait, no, for para substituents, each proton is next to substituents, so each H is a doublet. But in the case of two substituents, maybe it's a doublet for each set. Hmm, maybe more on that later.

6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H): Also aromatic. So, perhaps another set of aromatic protons. So maybe this compound has two aromatic rings, each with substituents that cause these shifts.

6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H): Broad singlet for two protons. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH group? But wait, the integral is 2H, so maybe it's a diol or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group, but in a conjugated system. Or ethylenic protons that are deshielded but not coupled strongly. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic di-substitution where two protons are adjacent and coupled, but in this case, a broad singlet? Hmm.

3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H): That's a low ppm, probably an OCH2 group. Like an ether or an alkoxy group. The doublet suggests coupling with another set of two protons. Maybe adjacent to a CH2 group.

Let me try to piece this together. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, molecular weight is 12*8 + 1*9 +14 +16 = 96 +9 +14 +16 = 135 g/mol. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR, the 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet. If it's an aldehyde, that's possible, but aldehyde protons usually are around 9-10 ppm, but usually singlet. So maybe it's an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated enal, which also can have a triplet if coupled with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, let's think about possible structures. The aldehyde group is a common functional group. Let's say the molecule has an aldehyde, then some substituents.

Looking at the 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H: That could be a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2... Or, perhaps, an ethyl group adjacent to something. Wait, but the integral is 2H, so maybe it's a CH2 group next to another CH2.

Wait, another point: The molecular formula is C8H9NO. That's one degree of unsaturation. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is 0 here. So: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees: that could be five rings, but more likely a combination of rings and double bonds. For example, one ring (benzene) is three degrees, a double bond (like an enal) is another, and then maybe another ring or another double bond. Wait, but let's count.

Wait, benzene is three degrees (three double bonds). So if there's a benzene ring, that's three degrees. Then, if there's an aldehyde (no new degrees), a double bond (like in an enal, that's another degree), and maybe an ether or something else. So 3 (benzene) + 1 (double bond) = 4. Another degree could be from another ring or another double bond. Alternatively, perhaps a carbonyl group? Let's see.

The NMR suggests an aldehyde, perhaps. But then, what else? Another
