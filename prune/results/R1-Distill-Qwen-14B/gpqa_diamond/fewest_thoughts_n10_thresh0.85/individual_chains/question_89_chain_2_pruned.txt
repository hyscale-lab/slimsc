Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage-like molecule. So 1,3-dibromo would mean there are bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure.

Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows some specific peaks: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, there's an IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1.

Hmm, IR absorbance at 1720 usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone (around 1700-1750 cm-1) or maybe an ester or aldehyde. But given the reaction conditions with KOH, which is a strong base, I think it's more likely to form a ketone. So maybe elimination has occurred, forming an epoxide or a ketone?

Wait, but wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH. That's probably an E2 elimination, because KOH is a strong base, and heating would favor elimination over substitution. So the two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons? No, wait, 1 and 3 positions. In adamantane, the structure is such that 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So if they eliminate, maybe forming some kind of ring-opening or forming a double bond? But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so if two bromines are on opposite faces, elimination would lead to a bridge or some sort of ring contraction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: when dibromides undergo elimination with a strong base like KOH, they form alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. So two adjacent Br atoms would eliminate to form a double bond. But in this case, the Br's are on carbons 1 and 3, which I believe are not adjacent. So how does elimination occur here? Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure allows for the two bromines to be on adjacent carbons in a different arrangement. Or perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, meaning the two Br are on adjacent carbons. Wait, 1 and 3 on adamantane—are they adjacent? Let me think about adamantane structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings fused. The 1 and 3 positions would be on adjacent carbons, I think. So perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, allowing for E2 elimination to form a double bond.

So when KOH is used, the two Brs would leave, and form a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-didehydroadamantane, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a bridge, creating a new ring. Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. Oh wait, the IR shows a carbonyl.

Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a beta elimination where a carbonyl is formed. Wait, another possibility: maybe the KOH is acting as a base, causing an elimination, but because it's a strong base and high temperature, perhaps it's a double elimination.

Wait, but if you have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, when KOH eliminates, you'd get a double bond. So product 1 would be an alkene. But the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, another reaction: perhaps when KOH is used with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, it isn't elimination but a substitution. But two substitutions would require something else. Alternatively, perhaps KOH is causing an epoxide formation. Wait, but epoxides usually form from vicinal dihalides (two adjacent
