Okay, so I've got this physics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations give infinite results. So regularization involves introducing a cutoff or some other method to make the infinities manageable, and then you take the limit where the cutoff goes away, hopefully getting finite results after renormalization.

Wait, but not all theories might need that. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Oh right, string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. String theory gets rid of the usual point particles and replaces them with strings. I think in string theory, the concept called "t Hooft's finiteness" makes it so that the theory is finite, meaning it doesn't require regularization or renormalization. Because all the divergences are somehow canceled out due to the stringy nature, like the way different modes and interactions balance each other. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills. But wait, it's also asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak. However, when you compute loop diagrams, especially in perturbation theory, you get divergences. So you need to regularize them, perhaps using methods like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization. So QCD does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism with quantum mechanics. It's a U(1) gauge theory. Now, QED does require regularization, right? Because when you calculate loop corrections like the electron self-energy, you get divergences. Hence, you need to regularize to handle these infinities before renormalizing. Without regularization, the calculations blow up. So QED needs regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the non-quantum version. Classical ED doesn't have the same issues with infinities because it's not a quantum field theory. There are issues with point charges and their fields having infinities, like the self-energy of a charge, but in classical theory, these aren't treated the same way as in QFT. However, I think that in classical ED, you don't use regularization techniques as you do in quantum theories. But wait, do you need regularization in classical ED? Hmm. Because in classical ED, you can have things like the infinite charge density at a point charge, but that's more of a mathematical representation issue. Since the theory isn't quantized, perhaps it doesn't require regularization in the same sense as quantum theories. But I'm not sure if that's what the question is getting at.

Wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So it's about whether the theory, when formulated, doesn't have any divergences that need regularization. 

So, in which of these is the theory free of requiring regularization?

Superstring theory (A) is supposed to be finite, so no regularization needed.

QCD (B) does require regularization because of the divergences in loop
