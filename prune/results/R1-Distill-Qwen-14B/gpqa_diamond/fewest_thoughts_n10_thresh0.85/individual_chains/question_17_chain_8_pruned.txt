Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium to form a complex.

The problem says the solution has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, stoichiometric means the ratio is 1:1, I think. So each Ca²+ is bound to one EDTA^4- ion. And the temperature is 25°C, which is standard conditions, so probably some standard K value. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. That's a big K, so the complex is very stable.

I remember that for a complex ion like this, the formation can be represented as Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is given. Wait, but sometimes people express it as the dissociation constant. Oh, right, because the problem states KCa-EDTA is 5e10. Hmm, wait, KCa-EDTA... I think that's the formation constant. Because K for the complex would be Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M. So when it dissociates, it would release some Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But since K is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be very low.

The problem is to find [Ca²+]. Hmm, so let's set up the equation. Let me think. Let's say the concentration of Ca²+ is x. Then, since each complex produces one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x. But wait, initially, the solution is just the complex, so the only source of Ca²
