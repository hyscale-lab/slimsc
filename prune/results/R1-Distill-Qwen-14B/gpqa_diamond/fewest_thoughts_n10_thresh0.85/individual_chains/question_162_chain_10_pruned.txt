Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is in two dimensions, right? Because it's got dx and dy. So maybe it's a 2D spacetime or some kind of surface metric.

I remember that in general relativity, the area of a surface can be found using the metric tensor. The area element in 2D is usually sqrt(g) dx dy, but wait, no, that's for the volume element. Or wait, in 2D, the area element would involve the determinant of the metric tensor. Let me think.

The metric here is written in terms of (dx² + dy²) multiplied by a function. So in terms of components, the metric tensor (g) would be a diagonal matrix with the same component for both g_xx and g_yy, which is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Because the line element is symmetric in x and y, so g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms (g_xy and g_yx) are zero.

So the determinant of the metric tensor g is the product of g_xx and g_yy because it's diagonal. So g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². Then the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, no, sqrt(det g) is the square root of the determinant. Wait, no, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy. Because in 2D, the volume element (which is area here) is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant.

So g = (32/(4 - r²))^2, where r² is x² + y². Because x² + y² = r², right? So sqrt(g) would be (32/(4 - r²)). So the area element dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

But wait, that's in terms of x and y. Maybe it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Because in polar coordinates, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So substituting, dA = [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the total
