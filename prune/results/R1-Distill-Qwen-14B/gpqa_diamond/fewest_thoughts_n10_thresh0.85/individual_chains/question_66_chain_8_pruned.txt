Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework used to describe physics beyond the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. But wait, what's the question again? Oh right, it's about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these. Let me think about each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I know that in physics theories, Lorentz symmetry is crucial because it relates to how different observers moving at constant velocities perceive space and time. In the Standard Model, all the interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. Since SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the SM, I'd guess that Lorentz symmetry must be preserved. So operators in SMEFT should transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz transformations plus translations. So it's the full symmetry of spacetime. The Poincare group includes things like boosts, rotations, and translations. In the Standard Model, the theory is Poincare invariant. So in SMEFT, the operators must also respect Poincare symmetry. Wait, but what defines Poincare invariance? It's that the theory is invariant under transformations of the Poincare group, which includes the Lorentz group and translations. So if the theory is Lorentz invariant, but not necessarily Poincare? Or if the theory is formulated in a way that Poincare invariance is part of the setup.

Wait, SMEFT is built in a way that the operators are classified into dimension-6 operators, each with a certain transformation property. But I think that the SMEFT operators are constructed to be invariant under the Poincare group. Because the SM itself is Poincare invariant, and the SMEFT is just an effective theory built from SM fields. So operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. So option 2 is correct as well.

Wait, but wait. The Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. So if the theory is Lorentz symmetric, is it automatically Poincare symmetric? Or does it require more? Because Poincare includes translations, which have to do with momentum. So for a theory to be Poincare invariant, it must be invariant under changes in the origin (translations), which implies that the vacuum is the same everywhere. But SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so perhaps it's formulated in a way that respects Poincare symmetry. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Wait, in the Standard Model, the theory is Poincare invariant. So when you construct SMEFT by adding higher-dimensional operators, those operators would have to transform in a way that the overall theory remains Poincare invariant. So yes, SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

But wait, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So each operator must be invariant under these symmetries, or transform in a way compatible with the theory.

Wait, no, perhaps the operators themselves don't have to be invariant, but the theory as a whole must be invariant. So the operators are part of the Lagrangian, which must be
