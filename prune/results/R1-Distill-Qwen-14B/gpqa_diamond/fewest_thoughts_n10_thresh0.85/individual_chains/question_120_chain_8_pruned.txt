Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax as parallax changes. Hmm, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The bigger the parallax, the closer the star because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, parallax (plx) = 1/distance, so higher plx means closer.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution—so I think that means the number density of stars is uniform in space. Oh, but wait, stars are three-dimensional, so maybe the number density is uniform in all directions.

So, the question is about how the number of stars per unit of parallax range (like a bin in parallax) changes with plx. So, if I have a range of plx values, say from plx to plx + dplx, how does the count of stars in that range depend on plx?

I remember that parallax is related to distance. Let me think, the formula for distance in parsecs is d = 1/plx. So, if plx increases, distance decreases, meaning the stars are closer.

Now, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (n) is constant. So number of stars = n * volume.

But wait, how does volume come into play for different parallax bins? Let's suppose we're considering a thin spherical shell at a certain distance. The volume of a shell with thickness dr is 4πr² dr. So, the number of stars in a shell would be proportional to r² dr multiplied by the number density.

But wait, parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So, r = 1/plx. Then, the volume element in terms of parallax would need to be expressed in terms of plx.

Alternatively, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx. Let's think about a small change in parallax, dplx. What does that correspond to in terms of distance?

Well, if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, if plx increases by dplx, the distance changes. Let's see, the differential: d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, dplx is negative because as plx increases, distance decreases.

But maybe I can think of the volume as a function of plx. Wait, for stars at a certain distance d, the volume around that point is a sphere of radius d. But when considering a range of distances between d and d + dd, the volume is 4πd² dd. So, the number of stars between d and d + dd is n * 4πd² dd.

But n is the number density, so number per unit volume. So, number of stars = n * 4πd² dd.

But since we're interested in parallax, let's substitute d = 1/plx. So, d = 1/plx ⇒ dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Since dplx is a small positive change, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases
