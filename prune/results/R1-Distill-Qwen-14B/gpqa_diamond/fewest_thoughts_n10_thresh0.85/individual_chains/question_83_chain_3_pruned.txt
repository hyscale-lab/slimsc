Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. We're given some specific volumes and concentrations, and we need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, first, I'll try to break down the problem step by step. Let's list out what's given:

- We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L.

Wait, wait. Diluting with equal volumes would change the concentration. Since the initial volume is 20 cm³ and we add another 20, the final concentration should be half of the original. Let me calculate that first.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. When we dilute with another 20 cm³, the new volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, right, because when you add equal volumes, the concentration halves. So after dilution, it's 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait another thought: Alternatively, maybe I should double-check that calculation. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then, when adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So moles remain the same (0.001), so concentration is 0.001
