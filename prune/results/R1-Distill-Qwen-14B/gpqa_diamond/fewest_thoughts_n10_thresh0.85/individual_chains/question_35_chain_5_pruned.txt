Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators, specifically the Y-component, A_y of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

The question says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π). And S is given as a matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, spin matrices are usually Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall what each looks like. The Pauli Y matrix σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly the S matrix here. So S must be σy. So A_y is c times σy. Since c is h/(4π), A_y = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So I need to solve A_y |φ> = a |φ>, where a is the eigenvalue.

Alternatively, since A_y is a 2x2 matrix, I can write it out and find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

First, let's compute the matrix form of A_y.

A_y = (h/(4π)) * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So the matrix elements are:
- (1,1): 0
- (1,2): -i * h/(4π)
- (2,1): i * h/(4π)
- (2,2): 0

So the matrix is:

[ 0 , (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π) , 0 ]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to find the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

The matrix (A_y - a I) would be:

[ -a , (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π) , -a ]

So the determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Calculating the determinant:

a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i * i is -1, so (-i)*i = -i² = 1.

So determinant becomes a² - [ (1) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) ] = 0.

So:

a² = (h²)/(16 π²)

Take square roots:

a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, wait, wait. So the eigenvalues a are plus and minus
