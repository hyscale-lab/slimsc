Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The question has three parts, each a different Michael addition reaction, and we're supposed to find the products (A, B, C) from the given options. Let's break down each part.

First, let me recall what Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile, usually a enolate, attacks the β-carbon, forming a new bond and creating a new carbon-carbon bond. The product is a conjugate addition product.

Alright, let's tackle each reaction one by one.

**Reaction 1: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH → A**

So, dimethyl malonate is a dienolate donor. Wait, no, wait. Dimethyl malonate is typically the donor in Michael additions because it's a good nucleophile, especially when deprotonated. Wait, but in this case, the conditions are NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH. Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates the malonate to form the enolate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3? No, wait, actually, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with p-tolyl on the acrylate. Wait, no, wait. Let me get the structure right.

Wait, acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So, E-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl group is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH
