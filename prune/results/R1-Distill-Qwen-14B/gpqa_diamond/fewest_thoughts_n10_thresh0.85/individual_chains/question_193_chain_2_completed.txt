Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars change with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are like different power laws.

Hmm. Right, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle subtended by the distance to an object, measured in parsecs. Oh wait, the formula for distance is distance = 1 / parallax. So, if plx increases, the distance increases as well. Because if something is closer, its parallax is larger, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if an object is farther away, its parallax is smaller. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs.

So the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that into the equation.

So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. So (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. Then, 1 divided by that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. Because if plx = 1/d, then 1/(plx)^5 equals d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. But wait, the question is asking about the number of stars per unit range of distance. Hmm. So I think it's about the differential number of stars with respect to distance.

Wait, so maybe I need to consider the number density as a function of distance. Let me think. The number of stars in a thin shell (a small range of distances) would be related to the surface density and the volume of that shell.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the count of stars as a function of distance. Wait, the problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. As I found earlier, this is N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases as the fifth power. But the options are about the change per unit range of distance. Oh wait, maybe I need to find the derivative of N with respect to d.

Let me model this. Let's say N is proportional to d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is a constant. Then, the number of stars per unit distance (like the rate of change) would be dN/dd = 5k d^4. But wait, the question isn't about the rate of change but the number per unit range. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the differential: how many stars are present in a small range dr at distance r. So the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr would be proportional to the surface density multiplied by the area of the shell and the thickness dr. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a region depends on the volume. But that's for a 3D case. Wait, but in the sky, for a given area, the number of stars you see at a certain distance depends on the volume along the line of sight. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of flux or density.

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The number of stars varies as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute d into that: N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5.

But the question is how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range. Hmm. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance (like dN/dr) would be 5d^4, which is proportional to d^4. But wait, that's the rate of change. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps the number in a thin shell (dr) is proportional to d^5, but that's because the volume element depends on r squared times dr (in spherical coordinates, volume element is 4πr² dr). Wait, no, maybe in this context, it's a 2D area, not 3D.

Wait, wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that we're looking at a fixed area in the sky, so the number of stars in that area depends on distance. So for a given area, the number of stars at a distance d is N = k * d^5. But wait, that's not considering how density changes with distance.

Wait, if we're talking about the count of stars as a function of distance, but the question is about the change per unit distance. So if you have a range of distance, say dr, how many stars are in that range? So the number per unit distance would be dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4.

Wait, but the options are in terms of r, not d. So if r is the distance, then the number per unit r is proportional to r^4. So looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Because another way to think about it: the number of stars is N = k/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, N = k d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Now, the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range of distance. So per unit increase in distance, how much does N increase? So dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the rate of change is proportional to d^4. So per unit distance, the number of stars increases by a factor of r^4. So the answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number density. The number of stars per unit volume. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So that's a relation for the total number in the region. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of differential number. Suppose the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr is given by N(r) dr. Then, from the given, N(r) dr = (some function) * dr. But N(r) is the number per unit distance.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as a differential. Let me consider that the number of stars in a region of the sky is N = k * (1/plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, N = k d^5. So the number of stars increases with d^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. So for a given distance r, the number of stars in the range from r to r + dr is approximately N(r) dr, where N(r) is the number per unit distance. So N(r) = dN/dr.

Wait, but N(r) is the number in a shell of thickness dr, so N(r) = (dN/dr) * dr. So the number per unit distance is dN/dr.

But from earlier, since N = k d^5, dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So as r increases, the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4.

So the correct option is C) ~ r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, we find \( N \propto d^5 \). 

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This requires determining the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which is \( \frac{dN}{dd} \). From \( N \propto d^5 \), we compute \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4 \). Since \( d \) is the distance, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). 

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
