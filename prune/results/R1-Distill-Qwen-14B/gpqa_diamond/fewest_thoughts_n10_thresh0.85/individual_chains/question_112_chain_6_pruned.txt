Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Let's read it again.

The state is |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, I remember that states are usually normalized, so I think I need to normalize this state first. Oh right, because the sum of probabilities should be 1.

So first, let me write the state vector as a column vector. |up> is [1; 0], |down> is [0; 1]. So |alpha> would be [1+i; 2-i]. But since it's proportional, I need to normalize it.

The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the inner product of the vector with itself. So the inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i). Let's calculate each part.

(1+i)(1-i) is 1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. And (2-i)(2+i) is 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) =5. So adding 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state becomes (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Next, the operator whose matrix elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So the matrix of this operator is a 2x2 matrix. Let's see:

A = [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ].

Wait, because when i≠j, so A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero. So it's a spin-x operator maybe? Because spin matrices for x and y usually have similar structures, but with different factors. Let me think: the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates of this operator would correspond to the eigenvectors of the Pauli X. The eigenvalues of Pauli X are +1 and -1. So the operator A has eigenvalues hbar/2 * 1 and hbar/2 * (-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. So the eigenstates of A are the |+x> and |-x> states, right? Because the Pauli X matrix's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, the eigenstates can be found by solving A|psi> = E|psi>, but maybe it's easier to note that for a 2x2 matrix like this, the eigenvalues are ±hbar/2 and the corresponding eigenvectors can be found.

Alternatively, another approach is to change the basis to the eigenbasis of A and express |alpha> in that basis. Then the coefficients will give the probabilities.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Find the eigenstates of operator A.

2. Express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

3. The square of the coefficients will give the probabilities.

4. The average value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Wait, let's get into more details.

Let me find the eigenstates of A.

The matrix A is:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A - λ I) = 0.

So determinant is (0-λ)(0-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ^2 - (hbar^2)/4 = 0.

Solutions are λ = ± hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for λ = hbar/2.

(A - (λ)I)|v> = 0.

So matrix becomes [[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]].

The equations are (-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0.

Simplify: -v1 + v2=0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are all scalar multiples of [1;1]. But we can normalize it.

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2, the matrix becomes [[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]].

The equations are (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2=0 → v1 = -v2.

Eigenvectors are scalar multiples of [1; -1].

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, because the eigenvectors we found are [1;1] and [1;-1], which when normalized are divided by sqrt(2).

So |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So now, we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized. So the normalized state is:

1/sqrt(7) * [1+i , 2 -i]^T.

Expressed in the computational basis (|up>, |down>).

So to express |alpha> in the |+x>, |-x> basis, we need to project it onto these states.

The projection coefficients are the inner products of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

Let me compute those coefficients.

First, write |alpha> as a vector:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Which in vector form is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so in vector form it's [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Similarly, |-x> is [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

So the inner product < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Factor out 1/sqrt(14) [since sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) = sqrt(14)].

So (1+i + 2 -i)/sqrt(14) = (3)/sqrt(14).

Similarly, the inner product < -x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2))*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14).

Calculating numerator: 1 + i -2 +i = (-1 + 2i).

So < -x | alpha > = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, so the expansion coefficients (amplitudes) are c_+ = 3/sqrt(14), and c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that.

Wait, when computing < +x | alpha >:

= [1/sqrt(2)]*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + [1/sqrt(2)]*(2 -i)/sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

= (3)/sqrt(14).

Yes, because 1+i +2 -i = 3.

Similarly, for < -x | alpha >:

= [1/sqrt(2)]*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + [(-1)/sqrt(2)]*(2 -i)/sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(14))

= (1+i -2 +i)/sqrt(14)

= (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

So the coefficients are c_+ = 3/sqrt(14), c_- = (-1+2i)/sqrt(14).

The probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Calculating |c_+|^2: (3^2)/(14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

|c_-|^2: [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, and 9/14 is approximately 0.6429. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Now, looking at the options. Let me check:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. The probabilities are 9/14≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571. So 0.64 is close to 9/14 (since 9/14 is approx 0.6429), and 0.36 is 5/14 approx 0.3571. So that matches the probabilities.

Wait, but
