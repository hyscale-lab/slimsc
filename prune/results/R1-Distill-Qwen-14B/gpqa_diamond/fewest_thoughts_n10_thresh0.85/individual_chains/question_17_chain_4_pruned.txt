Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium. So Ca-EDTA is a complex ion. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how strong the complex is. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. That probably means that all the Ca is in the form of the Ca-EDTA complex, so the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

I think the formula for the formation constant would involve the concentration of the complex and the ions it's formed from. The general formula for a complex is Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]), where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion.

But wait, in this problem, we're given K_Ca-EDTA, which I think is the same as Kf. So Kf = 5e10.

We need to find [Ca^2+], the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, all the Ca is tied up in the complex, but wait, no, because the complex dissociates a bit. So even though it's mostly in the complex, there's a little free Ca^2+.

The setup would be:

Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-])

But wait, what about the concentration of EDTA? Let me think. The initial concentrations... Wait, the solution is 0.02 M CaY^2-.

So [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M.

But what about the EDTA? Since the solution is stoichiometric, meaning the molar ratio of Ca^2+ to EDTA is 1:1. So the total EDTA in solution would be the sum of free EDTA (
