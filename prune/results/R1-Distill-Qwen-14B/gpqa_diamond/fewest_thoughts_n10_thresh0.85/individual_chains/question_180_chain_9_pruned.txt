Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. Got that.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm, so point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, the setup is like a central charge with 12 others arranged around it, each at radius 2 meters.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D, with some numbers in scientific notation.

Wait, energy here would be the electrostatic potential energy of the system, right? Because in an isolated system, the potential energy is a significant factor, especially when charges are placed in a configuration.

So I think I need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy for all the charges in the system. But wait, how do I approach this?

I remember that the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But wait, when dealing with multiple charges, you have to consider all possible pairs. So in this case, there are 13 charges. But one is fixed at P, and the others are 12 around it.

Let me break it down. The potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for each charge, I calculate how much energy it contributes due to its interactions with all the others.

Wait, but in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters away. So I can think of this as two parts: the energy from the 13th charge interacting with each of the 12, and the energy between the 12 charges themselves.

But wait, each of the 12 charges is
