Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see. The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think. Wait, no, actually, the wobble depends on the planet's mass and its distance from the star. 

So the problem says there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. They each have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The RV shifts are given: planet #1's spectral line shifts periodically by up to 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2's is 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the planet's orbit. The formula I think is something like the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * ( (1+M_p/M_star) )^(something), but wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Oh, right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the equation:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ] * [ (1) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (1 + cos i)) ) ] * [ ( (2π) / (P) )^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, but perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I remember a simplified version when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, which it is in this case (Neptune is much less massive than the Sun). So M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Then, the formula for K simplifies.

Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * ( (1) / (P^(1/3)) ) )

Wait, I think K is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ) but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the formula.

Wait, the formula I remember is:

K = (v) = [ (2π G) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So,

K ≈ [ (2π G) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But sin i is approximately 1 because the orbits are likely edge-on (since RV method works best when the orbit is edge-on, making sin i = 1). So,

K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, let me re-arrange this. Let's write it as:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (c^(1/3) * (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

So, since sin i is about 1, and M_p << M_star, we can ignore M_p in the denominator. So,

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (c^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because all the other terms are constants (since M_p and M_star are similar for both planets, and G and c are constants), the ratio of K1 and K2 would depend on P1 and P2.

Wait, the question says that both planets have similar masses, so M_p is the same for both. The stars have the same mass, so M_star is same for both. So in that case, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because for each planet:

K ∝ 1/P^(1/3)

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait wait, let me think again. Because if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3).

So, P ∝ (1/K)³

So, for planet #1, K1 =5 mA, planet #2, K2=7 mA.

So, K2 is larger than K1. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), that means if K increases, P decreases.

Wait, so for the same star mass and planet mass, the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.

So, for two planets, K1 and K2 are 5 and 7 respectively.

So, K2 > K1 → P2 < P1.

Wait, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So P2 / P1 = ?

We can write:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Because from earlier, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K³.

Wait, let me get the exact relation.

Since K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), so K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant (depending on other factors like mass).

So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Taking the ratio K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2) = (
