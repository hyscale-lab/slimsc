Okay, so I need to figure out which of these stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the question gives some important details about the two spectrographs. ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17 mag. HIRES at Keck, on the other hand, can observe up to 16 mag. So a star must be bright enough to be seen by both. Oh, wait, but wait—wait, the problem says that for ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So wait, does that mean 17 mag is the limit? Like, anything brighter than 17 (i.e., lower magnitude numbers) can be observed. Same for HIRES—brighter than 16 mag. So the apparent V magnitude of the star must be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. So both can detect if the star's apparent V mag is <=16? Because since HIRES can't go beyond 16, that's the stricter limit.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed"—so that's V < 17. Similarly for HIRES, V < 16. So the star's apparent V must be less than 17 for ESPRESSO, and less than 16 for HIRES. So the star must be visible to both, meaning its apparent V must be less than 16 mag. Because if it's 16.5, like some stars, then HIRES can't see it (since they only go up to 16). So the apparent V must be <=16 mag for both.

So the first thing I should do is calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star. Let's go through each star one by one.

Star1:
RA 15 deg, DEC -75, absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc.

Wait, absolute magnitude (Mv) is given. Apparent magnitude (mv) is calculated using the distance modulus:

mv = Mv + 5 + 5 log10(d) 

where d is distance in parsecs.

So for Star1: Mv =15.5, d=10 pc. log10(10)=1. So 5*1=5.

mv = 15.5 +5 +5*1 --> Wait, wait, no. The
