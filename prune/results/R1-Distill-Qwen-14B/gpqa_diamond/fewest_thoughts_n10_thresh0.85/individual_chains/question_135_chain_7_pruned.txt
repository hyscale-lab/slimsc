Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's think through this step by step. I'm a bit new to particle physics, but I'll try to piece this together.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f bar(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I remember that fermions are the matter particles like electrons, quarks, etc., and bosons mediate forces or are force carriers. So here, X is the boson field interacting with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find out what particles it can decay into at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible decay channels.

I remember that when a particle decays, the energy of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So each pair of fermions must have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of X.

Wait, but wait. The boson in question is X. For it to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, say f and f-bar, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because each fermion would take some energy, and their combined rest mass can't exceed X's mass.

So first, I need to list all the known fermions and their masses to see which ones have a mass less than 3 GeV each (since 6 GeV divided by two is 3 GeV). Because each fermion and antifermion pair would take up 2 * m_f, so X's mass has to be at least that.

Let me recall the approximate masses of the fermions:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV
- Up quark (u): around 0.003 GeV
- Down quark (d): around 0.005 GeV
- Strange quark (s): about 0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): around 1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV

Wait, wait. Let me double-check some of these numbers. I know the up and down are the lightest, so they're around a few MeV each. Strange is heavier, maybe around 100 MeV. Charm is about 1.5 GeV or so. Bottom is around 4.5-5 GeV, I think. Top is super heavy, like 173 GeV as I said.

So, looking at each fermion pair:

- For electrons: 2 * 0.0005 ≈ 0.001 GeV << 6 GeV. So X can decay into e+ e-.
- Similarly for muons: 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 GeV <<6. So μ+ μ- is allowed.
- Tau pair: 2 * 1.78 ≈ 3.56 GeV. Oh, but wait, X is 6 GeV. 3.56 <6, so that's allowed. So τ+ τ- is possible.
- What about quarks? Let's see each quark pair:
  - u and u-bar: 2*0.003 ≈ 0.006 GeV. Allowed.
  - d and d-bar: 2*0.005 = 0.01 GeV. Allowed.
  - s and s-bar: 2*0.095 ≈ 0.19 GeV. Allowed.
  - c and c-bar: 2*1.3 = 2.6 GeV. 2.6 <6, allowed.
  - b and b-bar: 2*4.5 =9 GeV. 9 >6, so not allowed.
  - t and t-bar: way beyond, so no.

Wait, that's important. The bottom quark is too heavy because 4.5 *2 is 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

So the possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check each option.

Option A: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-. But wait, from earlier, b is too heavy. So option A is incorrect because X can't decay into b bbar.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So this includes c, which is allowed because 2*1.3 is 2.6 GeV <6. Also, tau is about 3.56 GeV which is allowed. So B includes all the possible decay channels except for bottom.

Wait, but what about if any other fermions are in the options? Let's check all the options.

Option C: Includes t tbar. No, because that's way too heavy. So C is out.

Option D: Includes b bbar, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

So the correct decay options are c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e. So that matches option B.

Wait, but wait. The Lagrangian given is L = -λ f ψ_f bar (y) (v + X) ψ_f(y). Wait, but what are the indices here? Oh, the interaction seems to be between X and fermions. So the type of decay depends on what fermions X can interact with.

But the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the fermions, so we assume X can interact with all the fermions as long as the mass condition is met.

Wait, but the problem says "lowest order", which I think refers to tree-level decays, so the simplest possible. So if X can decay into any of the above fermion pairs, that's allowed.

So looking at the options, option B includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e. That's all the allowed ones except for the b and t.

Wait, but in the options, option B is:

c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yep, that's exactly the set I came up with.

So the answer should be option B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the possible fermion-antifermion pairs it can decay into. For a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) to be allowed, the combined rest mass of the fermion-antifermion pair must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq m_X \). 

### Fermion Masses and Decay Channels:
