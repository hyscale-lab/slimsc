Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, right, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the refractive index, but how does motion of the medium come into play?

So the setup is: a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Oh wait, no, wait—actually, the speed of light in the glass is already known, right? Because normally, speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed in vacuum. But wait, no, in this case, the glass is moving. So there's some relativity involved here.

Wait, this is probably a problem related to the relativistic Doppler effect or maybe the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because when the source or medium is moving, the observed frequency changes. But wait, no, the question is specifically about the speed of light in the glass as seen by the observer. Hmm.

Wait, no. The problem is about the speed of the light beam relative to the lab frame. Because the glass is moving, so the light's speed might change as observed in the lab. But wait, no, according to special relativity, the speed of light must always be c in any inertial frame. Oh wait, but in this case, the light is inside a medium, which complicates things. Because in a medium, the speed of light is v = c/n. But when the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think step by step. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light's velocity in the glass is v_light = c/n, because in its rest frame, the glass would have the light moving at c/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

In special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. They follow the velocity addition formula. So the formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. The velocity u of an object in the moving frame S' is observed in the stationary frame S as u. The transformation is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)), where v is the velocity of S' relative to S. Or is it the other way around? Maybe I'm getting the signs wrong.

Wait, in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab (S). The light's velocity in the glass (S') is v_light = c/n. So in S', the light is moving at c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion (since the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's movement). So in S', the light's velocity is u' = c/n, and the velocity of S' relative to S is v (since the glass is moving at v in the lab frame, which is S).

So applying the velocity addition formula, the observed velocity u in S is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/(c²)).

Wait, that's the correct formula. So substituting u' = c/n, and v being the velocity of the glass (which is the same direction as u'), so both are positive.

So u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: (c v)/(n c²) ) = v/(n c ). So denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c ) * (1/c²? Wait, no. Wait, denominator is 1 + (u' v ) / c².

So u' is c/n, v is v. So (u' v ) = (c/n) v. So denominator is 1 + ( (c v)/(n) ) / c² ) = 1 + (v)/(n c).

So denominator is 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v )/(n c )

Then u becomes numerator (c/n + v ) divided by denominator (n c + v)/(n c )

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which is [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify: (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, because (c + n v) is same as (n c + v ) when multiplied by n? No, wait, c + n v is not the same as n c + v. Wait, let me compute numerator.

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator after multiplying (c + n v) * c = c (c + n v) = c² + c n v.

Denominator is (n c + v ) * n. Wait, no, denominator is (n c + v).

Wait, no, the denominator after the division is (n c + v), and the numerator is (c + n v) * c.

Wait, let me see.

So u = [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the numerator of the second fraction cancels the denominator n of the first fraction.

So u = (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, that's (c (c + n v) )/(n c + v )

Hmm, looking at the options, which one matches this form.

Wait, let's factor the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: c (c + n v ) = c² + c n v.

Denominator: n c + v = v + n c.

Wait, so denominator is same as (n c + v ), which is same as (c n + v ). So the denominator is (n c + v )

So the expression for u is [c (c + n v)]/(n c + v )

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: (1 + n v )/(n + v )

Wait, but in our case, it's (c (c + n v )) / (n c + v )

But the problem says to take c=1, so let's substitute c=1.

Then u = [1 (1 + n v ) ] / (n * 1 + v ) = (1 + n v )/(n + v )

Which is exactly option A.

Wait, so the answer would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of velocity. Let me double-check. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity in the lab frame.

Wait, but when the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light beam is moving in the same direction, that would mean the light is going in the direction of the glass's motion. So the lab frame would see the light moving faster than in the rest frame of the glass?

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula, if the glass is moving at +v, and the light in the glass is moving at u' = c/n in the same direction, then the observed speed u would be higher than u' due to the addition. Because when two objects move in the same direction, their relative speed adds, but with relativistic factors.

So in our calculation, u comes out to be (1 +n v )/(n +v ), which is option A.

Wait another thing: if v approaches zero, what do we get? For small v, u ≈ (1 + n v )/(n + v ) ≈ (1/(n )) (1 + n v )/(1 + v/n ) ≈ (1/(n )) [ (1 + n v ) (1 - v/n ) ] ≈ (1/(n )) (1 + n v - v/n - v^2 ) ) ≈ (1/n ) (1 + (n-1/n )v + ... )

But if v is zero, then u should be c/n. Because in that case, the glass isn't moving, so the light speed in the glass should be c/n = 1/n when c=1. So let's check with v=0. Our option A becomes (1 +0 )/(n +0 )= 1/n, which is correct.

That makes sense. So when v=0, the speed is 1/n, which is correct.

So I think the correct answer is option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the speed of light in the glass (in the rest frame of the glass) is \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c = 1 \) (speed of light in vacuum) and \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n} = \frac{n + v}{n}
\]

Now, substitute this back into the formula:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

The \( n \) in the numerator and denominator cancels, leaving:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).

To verify, consider the case where \( v = 0 \) (glass is stationary). The speed of light in the glass should be \( \frac{1}{n} \), which matches the result when \( v = 0 \) in the derived formula. This confirms the correctness of the solution.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
