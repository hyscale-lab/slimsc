Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this describes the interaction between the boson field X and some fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Wait, so the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Since the Lagrangian involves ψ_f, which I guess are fermion fields. So X can couple to various fermions, but I need to check their masses because the decay has to be allowed kinematically. 

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So the sum of the masses of the two fermions in the decay must be less than or equal to 6 GeV for the decay to be possible. Also, in terms of pair production, each fermion must have mass less than 3 GeV because the fermion and antifermion each take some energy, so 2m_fermion ≤ m_X.

Let me list the fermion masses I know. The charged leptons are electrons, muons, taus. The electron is about 0.5 MeV, muon around 105 MeV, tau about 1.78 GeV. 

Quarks: up and down are the lightest. The up quark is like 2 MeV, down maybe 5 MeV. Then strange is around 95 MeV, charm about 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.5 GeV, top is super heavy at around 173 GeV. So top is way too heavy because 2 times 173 GeV is 346 GeV, way more than 6 GeV. So top quark is out.

Wait, but for the decay X → t t-bar, the mass would need to be at least 173 GeV each, so 346 GeV total. Since X is only 6 GeV, that's impossible. So t and t-bar can't be the decay products.

Other quarks: u, d, s, c. Let's see their masses. u is ~2 MeV, d ~5 MeV, s ~95 MeV, c ~1.5 GeV. So for each pair:

u u-bar: 2*2 MeV = 4 MeV → allowed since much less than 6 GeV.
d d-bar: 2*5 MeV = 10 MeV → allowed.
s s-bar: 2*95 MeV = 190 MeV → allowed.
c c-bar: 2*1.5 GeV = 3 GeV → 3 GeV ≤6 GeV. So yes, allowed.

Wait, but charm is 1.5 GeV each, so 3 GeV total. So X can decay into c c-bar.

What about bottom quarks? b quark is about 4.5 GeV. So 2*4.5 =9 GeV. But X is only 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar because 9 Ge
